  Living and having served my mission in the United States, it can be tempting to see missionaries as just 18 year old boys in a shirt and tie. Freetown reminds us that these boys are servants of God and where they go, miracles follow and faith increases.
  Caught in the middle of a brutal civil war, six Liberian missionaries in Monrovia flee the widespread violence in their native country. Their destination: Freetown, Sierra Leone. With the help of local church member Phillip Abubakar (Henry Adofo), the missionaries make the difficult journey, only to have their troubles compounded by a rebel fighter bent on killing one of their own. Based on incredible true events, Freetown is a thrilling and inspiring story of hope and survival.

7269922,2,B00Z0GEUWI,"This movie started out good, but ultimately became more of a propaganda piece for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints than a movie worth watching. I've seen lots of Africa Conflict movies, and this one was the least compelling. The drama isn't very exciting, and the dialogue contains so many sales pitches for conversion to Christianity that it begins to feel like a cheap infomercial. I was kind of surprised by this since it had such high reviews from other viewers. However, I didn't thoroughly read those reviews until after turning the movie off at about the halfway mark because it was so boring, but once I did it was clear that whoever made this movie contacted tons of folks aligned with the Church to write good reviews - so the reviewers were pretty much looking for a God movie, and really don't reflect a fair cross-section of typical viewers.",1459123200,2,869,4.723684210526316

I remembered reading the original true story on which it is based in the Ensign once, and remember thinking that the story would make an excellent movie.  I'm so glad that someone who had the ability to turn the story into a movie thought the same.",1453075200,,354,4.5
7269931,2,B00Z0GEUWI,I was expecting a lot more.  Ninety percent of the movie is missionaries driving around in red car.  There just isn't enough of a story here to justify making a movie.,1451260800,2,167,4.354838709677419

I am thankful to those that have worked hard to make this film & for those who actually lived the true events & stayed diligent in bringing it to us. We must all remember, there are missionaries out there in the world right now that are sacrificing every day just to share the faith & love of Jesus Christ.
If you haven't seen this show- Try it, I think you'll enjoy it.",1448755200,3,522,4.178217821782178
7269935,1,B00Z0GEUWI,"We were excited for this movie but really were disappointed in it. So slow and really boring. It was very hard to follow because when they did speak at all the accents were so strong and the English spoken so poorly it should have had sub titles. We actually tried it with subtitles after the first 20 minutes but that didn't help either. We couldn't even finish it after 45 minutes we decided our time and sanity are worth something. We didn't even finish it.
If someone wants ours they can have it. We will just be taking it to DI with our next donation. We just expected so much more. We loved Saratov Approach Etc. so disappointed and wish I hadn't wasted the money. When I say ""we"" I am referring to my husband and I.
My 18 yr old son that leaves on a mission in about a month wouldn't even sit down and attempt to watch it. He said all his friends in Seminary and his lies neighborhood friends didn't like it at all and he refused to waste a minute of his time watching it.
Our oldest son that's been home from his mission for just over a year wouldn't watch it either. Same reason he knew from every person that he has spoken with at College and his ward, roommates etc. that had ""attempted"" to watch it hadn't finished it either and told him ""that's 40 minutes of my life I will never get back!""
Those boys were right and this is one of only a few times I have actually purchased a movie without having seen it before. But I believed the ""good reviews"" on your site and bought it! I wish I hadn't! So disappointed and unhappy with it!
Lesson Learned! Will NEVER do that again and if my sons say something is that bad, I will believe them every time. Big thumbs down! Worst movie I have seen ever!",1448582400,2,1704,4.2140672782874615

7269948,4,B00Z0GEUWI,"In 1989 Mormons try to leave Liberia, engaged in a civil war. John Gaye (Phillip Adekunle Michael) is of the Krahn tribe being exterminated by the rebels. In a gut retching moment, he scratches out his name on his ""Elder Gaye"" name tag. The film was rather boring apart from the fact I have seen my first Black Mormon either in real life or on the screen. The civil war provided a background as a group of 6 crammed into a clown car drive through checkpoints preaching the word of God all while wearing white shirts and ties; white shirts that never wrinkle, have sweat stains, or get grass stains, even when you sleep on the grass. Do you have to be Mormon to get one of those? And do they come in different colors?

Inspiring, perhaps. But it was not a great action film and is on par with a made for TV ""Lifetime"" production.

Note to self: When attempting to sneak around at night, don't wear a white shirt. 3 1/2 stars",1440288000,,923,4.2988505747126435

7269950,3,B00Z0GEUWI,"This story is about African missionaries overcoming the odds and spreading the word of God. The odds in this case, are the Rebels. Unpredictable, feeding off fear and being trigger happy, the Rebels generally shoot first and ask no questions. Lucky for some of the missionaries, specifically one man in particular, has the respect of some Rebels and even has a bit of a reputation. At times, this man has saved other missionaries lives, just for being somewhat known.
After watching this film, I really valued my life and where I come from. These amazing people, though terrified as they wee, still stepped into harm's way to do what they thought was right. Really, what's not to admire about that? Also, hence my slight embarrassment over how easy we have it here and that we generally take it all for granted.
A truly inspiring film, though not one for children.

7269951,4,B00Z0GEUWI,"I'm a book lover and only watch one or two movies a year. Movies don't usually capture my attention, but this one definitely did. I was clutching my hands together and sitting upright through the entire movie. It was uplifting, terrifying, and touching. The only problem I had with the movie was I couldn't understand some of the dialogue with their accents. I would suggest using closed captions so you don't miss anything because there were funny lines in addition to the intense and tear-jerking moments.",1439942400,4,507,4.906976744186046
7269952,5,B00Z0GEUWI,This movie was realistic and a lot like Africa. After serving two missions in Africa we were thinking how much it looked and reminded us about our mission. We really enjoyed it!,1439683200,,177,4.5625
7269953,5,B00Z0GEUWI,"I was excited to be contacted by Deseret Book to review this DVD.  I love movies about faith.  They make great family home evening lessons :).

This story was so heart wrenching.  I have some nephews out on missions right now, so watching missionary movies is a little hard.  It hits a little too close to home.

This story was so beautiful.  In the midst of horrible racism in Liberia, six missionaries find themselves in a dangerous situation.  Many times they are forced to spend the day indoors, because of the rebels killing members of the Khran tribe.  It's absolutely horrible.  I will never understand racism, and hatred like that.  Ever.  It's absolutely unacceptable behavior.

When these missionaries are forced to stay inside most of the time, fighting to stay alive they decide it's time to do something about it.  They want to be able to spread the Gospel and they know staying in Liberia that it will never be safe for them.  Knowing that leaving the mission is against the rules, but also wanting to do what they have been called to do, they decide for their safety they must flee to Sierra Leone.

The journey they take is so inspiring.  Their faith is unwavering.  They enlist the help of a friend to drive them to Sierra Leone, but one Rebel is bound and determined to find these missionaries and eliminate them.

I love how much faith these missionaries had.  They were out serving the Lord, and they were not going to let a Civil War come between them and their mission.  The strength these boys had, and the determination is amazing.

All I could think about while watching this movie was this quote:

""DOUBT YOUR DOUBTS, BEFORE YOU DOUBT YOUR FAITH""

They had pure faith in what they were called to do.  It was beautiful.",1439164800,7,1744,4.602605863192182

This is based on a true story, and I have been blessed to have Marcus Mente,  A man on who the story is based, actually visit my classroom after the students have watched the film and share with us the complexity and terror that they went through trying to get out of the country. He is a man of great faith. Hearing about his experiences is both uplifting and inspiring. He is able to share with the students the reality And complexity of this difficult situation which the students only get a snapshot of through the for short film ( The film is full length but to have actually seen everything this group went through to exit the country would have taken a Mini series).  I like using this film in my world religion/ethics class because there are some cultural beliefs in the United States, that all mormons are white and that all mormons live in USA.
