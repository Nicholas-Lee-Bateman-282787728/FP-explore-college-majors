2068374,3,B00028G7LG,"The short first season (estended mini series and the next season all on 5 discs with some great extras, commentaries and reunion reaturette. Dallas ran 11 season, my favourites being seasons 3-8. But these are still solid episodes, and they lay the groundwork for all to come. But these were before they had season spanning story arcs, most of the episodes are 90% one shot storylines.  Cant wait for all seasons to be released, I hope they release them 2 seasons at a time.",1084838400,7,474,4.642857142857143

2068406,5,B00028G7LG,They say you cannot go back in time but I am really enjoying watching these episodes of Dallas. Dallas was and still is my favorite television series of all time. I was totally obsessed with this show and devastated when it went off the air. The original Dallas is one of the greatest shows in television History. I have never gotten into another television series since Dallas went off the air. I still watch certain shows on television but nothing compares to Dallas.,1485216000,,469,4.662650602409639

2068415,1,B00028G7LG,"The streaming version did not contain the first season.  Shame on you Amazon and shame on me for taking nearly a year to realize it.  The download is only the second season.

The show is indeed worthy of 4 to 5 stars but I paid for two seasons and did not get what I paid for.",1481414400,,276,3.892857142857143

2068451,1,B00028G7LG,"I haven't made it through season 1 yet and I've already found two episodes with distortion/defects. It's reminiscent of watching satellite TV during a thunderstorm. Additionally; the discs aren't labeled, so don't get them mixed up. At the moment I'm struggling through a distorted episode that features an actress other than the one pictured on the menu screen that opens the disc! Colleen Camp was the original Kristin, not Mary Crosby.",1473206400,,438,5.183098591549296

2068453,5,B00028G7LG,Even though it's dated and a bit melodramatic...Dallas is a lot of  nostalgic fun to watch. TV Dramas from the early 80's have a smooth pace in comparison to today's shows. Dallas is heavily character driven. And each and every actor is a delight. From Larry Hagman to Victorial Principal and Patrick Duffy. Binge the show and enjoy a bygone Era of Television.,1472774400,2,360,4.714285714285714

Good writing without the political correct garbage being forced down the viewers throat more than a pleasure to watch a second time around even better without commercials or having to wait a week for the next episode.

Seasons 1&2 (they come as a package) do not work on mobile devices, specifically they did not work on my iPhone or iPad using the Amazon video app. I could view them on the web, but that's not usually where I watch these types of videos. One of the techs said it may have to do with licensing. Amazon customer support was not able to fix the problem and they very generously refunded the payment. I'll probably check back in a year or two to see if the issue has been resolved and re-buy if possible.",1456531200,,557,4.264150943396227

Is only the very first episode the free with ads choice?",1453680000,,358,3.9305555555555554
2068516,4,B00028G7LG,"I am satisfied with the discs.  However, there was a noticable scratch in one disc but it did play without any problem.  Some of the discs show little ""spots"" but I guess that comes from transfering something of that age to a disc.  They don't interfere with the picture but are visible and do go away.  I had forgotten how the series developed and soon you were hooked on the show.  I am at that point so it may be possible I might purchase seasons 3 and 4.",1453507200,,458,4.159090909090909

However the 3rd disc would not play it appeared that there was some debris of some sort between the disc halves at the time they were sealed.

  I guess I didn't remember how evil Dallas really was. I wonder how many women thought it was okay; To ""drink"" while being pregnant. He was having affairs on his wife all the time.

2068831,4,B00028G7LG,"""Looks like I underestimated the new Mrs. Ewing.  I surely won't do that again."" -J.R. Ewing

Thus ends the pilot episode, with Pam having foiled the first of J.R.'s schemes to get her out of the Ewings' lives, but it is certainly far from the last!

Other reviews have provided readers with a layout of the plot, so I'll just say a few things that have probably already been said, but are worth repeating.  First, the show has some good early episodes (Digger's Daughter, Spy in the House, Barbecue, Reunion Parts 1&2, Black Market Baby, and Election), but in my opinion the writing is hit-or-miss until approximately 2/3 of the way into Season ""2"" (S1 on TV), when two major events happen.  Both events are, of course, soap storyline staples, but both served to rapidly thicken the plot and serialize the show for good.

As for the cast, it really helped make the series what it was.  One-time comedy star Larry Hagman takes a bit of a backseat initially, but by the end of the first season you can sense that his portrayal of amoral, selfish, philandering J.R. has just scratched the surface of its potential, and that he is about to become the breakout character (indeed, THE television character of the early-to-mid 80s).  Linda Gray, previously most famous for being Anne Bancroft's leg double in the best-known promotional image for 'The Graduate', turns in a solid performance as J.R.'s wife Sue Ellen, a neglected, fading beauty queen unhappy with her marriage and her life.  Former Broadway star, and occasional Hitchcock cast member Barbara Bel Geddes embodies matriarch Miss Ellie like no other.  Jim Davis, a veteran of B-list westerns, adds instant 'old wildcatter' credibility to the character of Jock.  Patrick Duffy, whose career had been launched the year prior on the short-lived sci-fi TV series ""The Man From Atlantis"", turns Bobby into the sanctimonious antithesis of brother J.R.  Victoria Principal's Pam is the star-crossed princess to Duffy's knight in shining armor, and is also there to look gorgeous.  Ken Kercheval was not yet a regular, but his portrayal of power-hungry, yet naive Cliff Barnes in the episode 'Election', has him primed to be J.R.'s arch-nemesis and favorite chew toy for years to come.

It was aired in primetime, so there was only one episode a week/~22-30 per season, which means the plot advances at a decent pace.  Bottom line - yes, it's a soap opera, but this isn't your mother's plodding daytime soap.",1370563200,,2457,4.900966183574879

2068840,5,B00028G7LG,"............were raw, unpolished, crude, but absolutely awesome!!! The first 'season' of Dallas was actually the 5 part miniseries that I alluded to. Here, Southfork Ranch isn't the Southfork that 98% of us only knew; it's a totally different looking house and grounds. Inside, the furnishings are bland (compared to later on), and the outside features a circular driveway. Furthermore, a few episodes feature harsh weather conditions, which is in total contrast to the almost always sunny conditions that we've come to know in subsequent years. The shooting for the miniseries took place in February; this provides something different for big fans who hadn't seen the miniseries before. Character development was a work in progress, even for J.R. The show was originally supposed to center around the relationship of Bobby and Pam, but J.R. became the breakout character, and thus the focus shifted. However, I think that all of the characters had a presence early on. I particularly like Victoria Principal's portrayal of Pam (she's extremely easy on the eyes, and a 20 on a 1-10 scale). I also like the portrayal of Digger Barnes. I love the 5th episode (Barbeque) where he has too much to drink (really?) and sings Yellow Rose of Texas. This is a memorable episode for sure. And Ray Krebbs was quite the womanizer. I also noticed that in the early episodes of Dallas, there would often be episodes that had no continuity from one to the other; they were just one episode, then the next week had nothing to feed from the previous week. To sum up, the viewer gets to see the evolution of this great TV show when watching the episodes in order. The special features are very interesting as well. This DVD collection is money well spent for those who appreciate dramas centered around money, power, politics, and many other indulgences.",1367452800,,1836,4.944983818770226

I have 2 connections to ""Dallas""
I moved to Dallas because of the series.

If you folks remember Rebecca Wentworth and the house she lived in.
I worked security for this house for 2 weeks. We had 2 guards on and 2 cops on duty
They had an auction at this house.
As I remember it's off of Marsh Lane.
Trust me I took good care or it, and stopped invaders frrom coming in.

2nd. It's when Bobby ""died""
The day of the funeral I was in Parkland Memorial Hospital in 1985 and had knee surgery, and I was not able to watch the episode, which pissed me off. I was too groggy I had to sleep. To this day I still have not seen the whole episode.
I will collect it along with the rest of the series, all in due time.

It is sad Jim Davis died during the series, I just hated to see ""Dallas"" kill Jim off. RIP Miss Ellie as well.
But maybe they had to.

JR teaches me one thing.
Be ruthless against Obama, cheat the bastard if you have to. Obama cheats us. We should cheat him.

JR EWING FOR PRESIDENT
He would save this country from ruin, and provide oil field jobs to people.

Aired in the late 1970's, the series took off for fourteen seasons of enjoyable fun, sadness and intrigue...and it's coming back this summer on TNT, with Bobby, Sue Ellen, Lucy, Ray, Cliff, and of course J.R., returning for more cloak-and-dagger dealings in more ways than one.

The show dealt with what at the time were considered taboo subjects for television, and by today's standards, it's very tame. With that in mind, it's suitable for ages 17 and older. Unfortunately, God's name is paired with a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity in at least one episode, something which i never thought was done on network shows. However, if you can deal with it, by all means, view the series. I can deal with it, though it makes me uncomfortable now.

I will not give a thorough review, highlighting every episode, as each one contains its own twists, turns and shockers that the series became known for, and what kind of fan would i be if i let the cat out of the bag? Exactly. Not a good one, so I will merely say that the series features excellent acting from everyone involved (especially Barbara Bel Geddes, who was James Stewart's love interest in the classic Hitchcock film Vertigo; and two episodes in particular focus on her, and she carries the weight very well). There are several two-part episodes, and the season finale is an exciting two-part shocker. I highly recommend this series. You cannot skip an episode, because events that occurred in previous episodes are referenced in later episodes.

I definitely have to give the writers credit because aside from coming up with this fantastic series and the incredible storylines, they really did an incredible job developing the relationships and depicting the good (Miss Ellie and Jock), bad (Sue Ellen and J.R.) and maturing (Pamela and Bobby) marriages. Very well done, indeed.

A final word. Do NOT watch the SoapNet special included in this set as a special feature, because it contains a spoiler to an episode from season 3.",1335744000,,2828,4.858921161825726

2068923,5,B00028G7LG,"Way back in 1978, on the 2nd April precisely, CBS aired the first episode of a short miniseries entitled Dallas. Set amont the Ewing and Barnes families, soon viewers became familiar with the lives and loves of Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), JR Ewing (Larry Hagman), Jock Ewing (Jim Davis), Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy), Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton), Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes) and Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray). Of course the series would not have been complete without ""outsider"" Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly) and Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval).
Returning as a regular series in September, until April 1979 CBS started what was to be a 13 year run of the show. All 29 episodes of this run feature on this discset. The show went onto enjoy huge ratings, and the following season 1979/80 provided fans with one of soaps biggest cliffahngers ever ""Who Shot JR?"". The success of the soap led to ITV (the commercial rival to BBC in the UK) attempting to poach the series from the BBC later in 1985.
This set is the only time we see winter in Dallas and snow can be seen in the short miniseries.
The late Barbara Bel Geddes shines in her role and created an extremely caring affectionate mother to the Ewing clan who was always there no matter what problems the family were in. Bel Geddes is surrounded by equally talented performers throughout the series' run.
We also meet two characters played by Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackleford who go onto success in a spin off series Knots Landing.

2068926,5,B00028G7LG,"...says Victoria Principal's character Pam in a 1979 episode. Actually, nothing could be further from the truth because these first two seasons of ""Dallas"" take their time introducing the main players at Southfork and the cast did not become huge and sprawling until the '80s were well underway.

The first season of ""Dallas"" originally aired as a CBS mini-series in the spring of 1978 and was so successful that the network picked up the show as a weekly series for the 1978-79 TV Season. The episodes that composed both that ""trial-run"" and first full season are contained here. The suprising thing about these early ""Dallas"" offerings is that, while many plot threads are stretched throughout the season, each episode is also suprisingly self-contained so that anyone stumbling across one of these randomly will still be able to follow the action. Speaking of action, it's amusing to see how many outlandish events occur in this first box set alone: two kidnappings, a hostage crisis, a plane crash and a heart attack all within the first 20 episodes. There are some missteps as when the writers throw these outsider plots into the mix, such as random characters holding the Ewing women hostage, or kidnapping Bobby. The show works best when it sticks to the back-stabbing within the world of the Ewings and the high-powered oil industry.

The acting is top-notch all around. Larry Hagman has already captured the evil but amusing essence of J.R. Ewing. Charlene Tilton gets some juicy material in the first episodes, but isn't given as many interesting things to do as the season progresses. Ken Kercheval is a delight as the impish and devious Cliff Barnes, especially during his fling with Sue-Ellen when he knows how badly it would get under J.R.'s skin. Linda Gray is most interesting as Sue-Ellen when she's standing up to J.R. and throwing out ultimatums. Patrick Duffy and Victoria Principal are adorable as the beautiful newlyweds with the world in their hands, and each of them parade around in swimsuits in nearly every other episode, filling the cheesecake/beefcake quota more than adequately. Victoria looks gorgeous whether she's sporting long, lustrous locks or the sassier, choppier hairstyle she adopts late in Season 2. Tina Louise shows up as J.R.'s secretary/lover and looks the same as she did 15 years earlier as Ginger on ""Gilligan's Island"" except for the feathered Farrah 'do. Her performances are more interesting when she returns late in Season 2, though her Southern accent comes and goes within any given appearance.

There are some dated and wince-inducing bits such as a few disco scenes and Sue-Ellen being forced to sing ""People"" at gunpoint in her Miss Texas sash and swimsuit, but for the most part ""Dallas"" is still fun and entertaining over 30 years later. I am enjoying every minute of it and I was not a big fan of prime-time soaps back in their heyday. I am glad for the chance to revisit them on DVD and see what I missed the first time 'round.

The picture quality varies from episode to episode, with some scenes looking bright, colorful and clear while others are washed out and show dirt and specks and are overall grainy. There are various cast commentaries from the likes of Hagman and Tilton, but I didn't find them that interesting, so will just enjoy the episodes themselves.",1296864000,2,3328,4.926916221033868

It's true that at this point the episodes were mostly self-contained so there is a very different feel to later when everything was serialized.  However, as it was a new show there were enough fresh concepts to keep self-contained episodes very interesting and good until that point.  The original cast is all here, and over the course of the season you can see how JR and Sue Ellen grow from villainous background characters into the interesting and conflicted center of the show, while straight men Bobby and Pam move from the lion's share of the screen time heroes to essential good guys to balance out the other half of the coin on the show.  Ken Kercheval does some excellent development, turning Cliff Barnes into a classic underdog character, and the rest of the supporting cast finds their role.  But of course it was Larry Hagman who did a masterful job creating the perfect TV anti-hero, who would change the face of television and challenge the perceptions of the kind of stories that could be told with the medium.  Today such a character like this might not make it on this type of show, but the time was just right for JR Ewing to turn into the grinning shark of American prime-time.",1294012800,,1285,4.638766519823789

2068931,5,B00028G7LG,"Probably the most successful nightime soap opera to air, ""Dallas"" paved the way for other serials to make their mark during the evening hours such as well-known shows like ""Dynasty"", ""Falcon Crest"", and the ""Dallas"" spin-off ""Knots Landing"", as well as lesser-known series such as ""Flamingo Road"" and ""The Colbys"". However, it is ""Dallas"" that people still remember as being the granddaddy of all nightime soaps during the 1980's when it was breaking Nielsen numbers and garnering ratings that were even larger than today's ""American Idol"".

 ""Dallas"" dealt with the rich Ewing clan of Dallas, Texas headed by Jock and Miss Ellie who had three sons; J.R., the evil guy of the family who was married to the alcoholic Sue Ellen; Bobby, the hunky stud recently married to the beautiful Pamela Barnes whose family had a feud with the Ewings for decades; and the long estranged son of the Ewings, Gary, a drunk. Lucy was the spoiled grandchild of Jock and Miss Ellie who were raising her due to Lucy's father's (Gary) bout with the bottle. These characters and the stories they inhabited made ""Dallas"" into the phenomenom that it would become in the early eighties. J.R, Sue Ellen, and Miss Ellie all became pop culture characters and would shape the series virtually for all its 14 seasons on CBS.

 This wonderful boxset contains the first five episodes of ""Dallas"" that aired in April, 1978. Although Warner Brothers has stated these five shows were the first season , ""Dallas"" originally aired as a mini-series, and it wouldn't be until the fall of 1978 that ""Dallas"" would become a full-fledged series raking in 24 episodes. This box set contains all of those 29 episodes on dual-layered dics and comes with a splendid interview with some of the cast members from a special that aired on cable's Soap Net in the early 2000's. There are also various audio commentaries form different cast members such as Larry Hagman.

 The first five episodes made ""Dallas"" the #44 show of the 1977/1978 television season and that was enough to convince the network to bring it back in the fall. The 1978/1979 season is when ""Dallas"" really hit it stride dealing with Sue Ellen's affair with Cliff Barnes (J.R's arch enemy and Pam's brother) and the revelation that she was pregnant. The question was, ""who was the father?"". That season ended with what ""Dallas"" was known for, a cliffhanger, as Sue Ellen was involved in a terrible car crash and her life and the baby's hung in the balance.

 Unlike all the other primetime serials that have seen one or two of their seasons released to DVD, Warner Brothers has released all of ""Dallas'"" seasons in their entirety for new generations to enjoy for posterity.

 An important bit of information is the fact that cable's TNT has ordered a pilot for a new version of ""Dallas"" so that is something we ""Dallas"" fans should be elated about!",1288224000,,2866,4.818737270875764

2068948,4,B00028G7LG,"I'm not quite sure why this series interests me.  As Jim Davis (patriarch Jock Ewing in the series, until he died) said in an interview, ""It's just a damned soap opera.""  And it is, with the usual elements of soap opera:

(1) Single dimension characters.  J.R. is a strutting womanizer and liar.  Bobby, with his trick or treat haircut, is the good brother.  Sue Ellen is the drunk and hit-me victim.  Pam just slices through life with nary a worry about the future or funds.  Miss Ellie is too sweet and understanding for words.  Cliff can be counted on to do something stupid and get taken by J.R.  You get the picture.

(2) There are meaningful close-ups, often baleful.  Also, lots of half-whispered dialogue that is supposed to be dramatic.

(3) Many dramatic scenes take place in hospitals and court rooms.  Almost everyone has some life-threatening malady or is charged with a serious crime at one time or other

(4) Whenever anyone comes into a room, someone is sure to ask, ""Can I get you a drink?""  Copious amounts of whiskey, wine, vodka and beer are imbibed, whereupon characters get in their cars and buzz off somewhere.  Only Sue Ellen wrecks her car while DWI.

(5) There's just one crisis after another--murders, kidnappings, several plane crashes, car wrecks, fires, rapes, etc.

(6) While awl bidness money is at the center of the plots and vast fortunes are seemingly lost, no one ever seems to worry about where the next meal is coming from or how to pay the mortgage.

(7) There's always a parking space at the front door of office buildings, hospitals, etc.

(8) The Ewings have breakfast al fresco, and there are no insects to bother them.  And it only rains at night.

And yet I can't help watching season after season of this campy program.  It's like watching that movie short of two steam train engines colliding head on at full speed.  The women are all beautiful victims.  The men are all womanizers.  And they all have the morals of alley cats.  How could I resist that combination?  Art it is not.

2068958,3,B00028G7LG,"DALLAS was one of my all-time favorite TV shows.  However, I didn't start watching it until 1980, around the time the entire world was in the grips of ""Who shot J.R.?"" fever.  Now, for the first time, I went back in time to the very beginning, when it first premiered as a 5-part mini-series in April 1978 and was picked up again the following Fall.

This was a show that definately took some time to get jump-started into the nasty, continuous nightime soap opera that fans came to know and love.  In fact, not until the last two episodes on the 5th disc (""John Ewing III""), does the series have any real juice to it.  Nearly every episodes plays out like a three-act play, with a convenient and almost ""happily-ever-after"" resolution at the end.  Some of the acting by supporting players can be pretty bad, too - particularly in some episodes (3 of them) that involve members of the Ewing family being taken hostage.

2068961,5,B00028G7LG,"When ""Dallas"" premiered as a five-part trial miniseries in 1978, it followed on the heels of the last primetime soap opera, ""Peyton Place."" While the earlier show had the benefit of being adapted from a bestselling novel and successful movie adaptation, ""Dallas"" could only find itself being a distant reminder of ""Giant,"" featuring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean, a film about the struggle between two powerful Texas oil families.

Also, ""Peyton Place"" had a cast of established stars (Oscar winner Dorothy Malone and Ed Nelson) and exciting up and comers (Mia Farrow, Barbara Parkins, and Ryan O'Neal, among others). ""Dallas"" boasted an actor known primarily for his successful comedic turn as an astronaut saddled with a mischievous genie (Larry Hagman in ""I Dream of Jeanie""); a veteran of stage and screen (Barbara Bel Geddes); an actor that starred in the short-lived sci-fi show ""The Man from Atlantis"" (Patrick Duffy); an actor that had been featured in countless westerns (Jim Davis); and an actress that had some less-than-stellar appearances in television and on film (Victoria Principal). The other key roles on the show were assigned to performers that were virtual unknowns to TV audiences (Steve Kanaly, Ken Kerchival, Linda Gray, and Charlene Tilton).

However, once ""Dallas"" premiered, it was obvious that America found something engaging about the ongoing saga of the wealthy Ewing clan and its ongoing battle to remain at the top, regardless of whatever bodies fall by the wayside. Most popular of the show's characters was the anti-hero J.R., played by Hagman. J.R. was ruthlessness personified and Hagman obviously relished playing the part.

The actor could do more with a pause, a look, or an aside than more actors could do with entire pages of dialogue. Witness his look in the late-in-the-season installment, ""Call Girl,"" when he discovers that his plan to drive hated sister-in-law Pam (Principal) out of the family has fallen through and hears her voice behind him.

In the words of the credit card commercial, his expression is priceless.

As far as the total DVD compilation is concerned, the show is addictive as each episode delves into not just J.R.'s machinations and addresses such topics as drug and alcohol addiction, environmental concerns, marital strife, sexuality, family in-fighting, and adolescent wanderings.

Yes, for all their wealth, the Ewings reflected the America of its day.

Besides Hagman's award-deserving performance, the other performers are equally up to the task. Of the remaining cast members, it is Linda Gray's longsuffering ""Sue Ellen"" that emerges as the breakout performance of the series. Intially a secondary character, Sue Ellen develops as the character with whom the audience can most sympathize: a woman in a loveless marriage to a man to whom she is no more than a trinket of his romantic conquest. Her scenes with Hagman, often vicious and filled with histrionics, are the stuff of legend and both actors go at it, tooth and nail.

The best examples of Gray's work can be seen in the installments ""Act of Love,"" ""For Love of Money,"" ""Sue Ellen's Sister,"" and ""John Ewing III (Parts I and II)"".

The first season compilation also boasts guest star turns from a couple of western performers and one of the cast of another classic 60's comedy. Gene Evans is great as Miss Ellie's brother, Garrison, in ""Home Again,"" while John McIntyre appears as a revered statesman in ""The Outsiders."" The latter episode also features Susan Howard who would later become one of the regulars in a few seasons to come.

Tina Louise, late of ""Gilligan's Island,"" appears in several episodes as J.R.'s secretary Julie, the holder of many of her boss's sinister business dealings.

Also, there are appearances of future stars of film and television: Brian Dennehy, Kate Mulgrew, Peter Horton, Veronica Hamel, and Greg Evigan.

Even the secondary tier of actors, those whose characters are essential to the storyline are memorable, chief among these being Fern Fitzgerald as ""Marilee Stone,"" the wife of one of J.R.'s chief allies and Barbara Babcock as Pam's boss, Liz Craig.

This DVD collection would also mark the first and last appearance by actors whose part will be recast in later seasons, to the betterment of the show: David Wayne's ""Digger Barnes"" would be later portrayed by movie legend Keenan Wynn while Colleen Camp's ""Kristen Sheppard"" would find itself more memorably assayed by Mary Crosby.

One thing to note about a welcome change in later seasons was the change in the characters of Lucy (Tilton) and Ray (Kanaly). Though the characters had had a romantic relationship in the miniseries, as well as for much of the first half of the initial season, the producers wisely choice to eventually downplay it and ultimately remove it from the show.

This is especially beneficial in that in later seasons, it would be revealed that Ray was the illegitimate son of Ewing patriarch Jock, making him Lucy's uncle.

Pedophilia and incest are two things that this series didn't need to add to its other melodramatic trappings.",1170460800,6,5099,5.103241296518608

2068963,5,B00028G7LG,"What a blessing! This DVD transported me to the golden age of the late 70s and the 80s, less complicated times filled with happy memories. Dallas made a huge contribution to popular entertainment in this era before mobile phones and other irritating gadgets. Talking of phones, JR always answered it with a curt ""Yello"" and hung up without saying goodbye.

This set opens with newly-wed Bobby and Pam on their way to Southfork Ranch, blisfully happy with only the wise Pamela expressing concern over the fact that she's the daughter of Digger Barnes, great enemy and rival of patriarch Jock Ewing. And it gets better and better with exquisitely complex intrigues! The Ewing family, who became family to millions way back then, never disappoints.

For those who watched the complete series, it is interesting to see the character development from the very beginning. For example, Ray Krebbs is a highly unprincipled scoundrel who later became decent and honest. Sue Ellen (Swellen to JR), still a vapid beauty queen here, evolved into a graceful, mature womanhood after a long struggle with demon drink. In between, many times when discovering JR's infedilities, she slapped his face, her lower lip quivered and she said ""bestid!""

The devious little Lucy, very much the delinquent, eventually chilled and unfortunately disappeared too soon from the series. Pam is the one who impresses most with her can-do attitude and sound moral principles. Others never changed much: the long-suffering Miss Ellie is good and remained so to the end, whilst the charmingly evil JR never gave up his tricks. He in fact got worse. Others include Cliff Barnes, Gary and Valene Ewing, Jenna Wade, Kristin Shepard and Donna Culver.

These 29 episides includes Swellen's descent into alcoholism because of JR's neglect, Cliff's vendetta against Ewing Oil and run for political office, Swellen's affair with Cliff Barnes and many, many more nail biting situations. There are also the notorious and dramatic Ewing parties around the pool and the dubious oil dealings. The plots unravel fast, nothing is drawn out too long, the acting is great and the cinematography is superb. It is like seeing old friends again and revisiting fondly remembered places. Dallas still remains the very best soap opera series after all these years, although Dynasty and Falcon Crest were also most entertaining.",1168646400,2,2370,5.148051948051948

I hadn't really planned on purchasing it when it became available on dvd.  I was waiting for ""Knots Landing"" or ""Falcon Crest"" to become available, for those were the shows that I was really looking forward to owning.  I picked up ""Dallas: Season 1 & 2"" while visiting Sam's Club, (it was on a fantastic sale and I couldn't pass it up) and decided I'd watch a couple of episodes when I got home.  Yeah, right.  This is one of the most addictive prime time shows ever!

2068972,5,B00028G7LG,"Unlike many of the classic 80's TV Series - 'Dynasty' and 'Falcon Crest' immediately spring to mind - 'Dallas', that venerable institution that defined Prime Time for a whole generation, hit the ground running with this, a premiere season that, even by today's standards, hits home runs on almost all fronts. Acting, script, production values and editing, not to mention some of the most perfect casting ever to grace television, all come together here to make for something far deeper and better than we think we remember.

Put simply, season one of 'Dallas' is excellent.

Gorgeous Bobby (Patrick Duffy), second son of the powerful Ewing clan, has married gorgeous Pamela (Victoria Principal), only daughter of embittered alcoholic Digger Barnes. Which would be fine, ordinarily, but the long-standing feud existing between Digger and Ewing patriarch Jock (involving Jock's ethically questionable acquisition of both oil fields and one Miss Ellie Southworth-Ewing from his onetime partner Digger) is so strong that it threatens to overpower the fragile Romeo-and-Julietesque marriage between Bobby and Pam.

As if that weren't enough to contend with, Pamela also has to watch her back: her ex-boyfriend - ranch hand Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly) - is having an affair with Bobby's evil teenage niece Lucy (Charlene Tilton), and neither party is exactly happy at her arrival on the ranch. But worst and most dangerous of all is Bobby's elder brother JR (the eponymous Mr. Larry Hagman), and his social-climbing wife Sue Ellen (the glorious Miss Linda Gray): threatened by her arrival, JR for professional and filial reasons, and Sue Ellen for her hard-won family standing; both parties, in their own way, set about to drive the hapless Pam off. The scene is set, then, for machiavellian misdoings and - as per the DVD box blurb - ""Texas-sized conniving"". Indeed.

It reads like a soap-opera, this synopsis, and while we may all remember 'Dallas' as the most successful prime-time soap of the Eighties, the first and second seasons don't play as such: unlike Dynasty (as good, in a wholly different, more exaggerated way), Dallas isn't about baroque overstatement and huge camp value. Seasons one and two, surprisingly, are very, very well-made. The cast is excellent - Hagman, Grey, Duffy and the very wonderful Barbra Bel Geddes as Miss Ellie - all give a committed and impressive depth of characterisation to their parts, and newcomers like Victoria Principal and Charlene Tilton do more than hold their own against the seasoned pros.

Writing is far better than most of today's so-called 'scripts' for TV - it's plausible, witty and never dull or tired. Plots come and go on an episodic basis, but thanks to the obvious talents of the scriptwriters, the characters grow and develop over a period of time, so while there's always something new going on, we are also able to form attachments to our particular favourite players.

DVD Quality is pretty good, and the extras are run-of-the-mill, but the Soapnet reunion special is a nice bonus. Presentation, both in-menus and box art, is top-notch, and all in all, ""Dallas - The Complete First and Second Seasons"" is a definite addition to anyone's DVD collection. Dust off your Stetsons, kids, and relax with some of the best television America's ever had to offer.

Wholly recommended as an essential purchase!",1139875200,4,3359,5.118613138686132

Patrick Duffy, Victoria Principal and more play Texas sons and daughters whose lives revolve around oil, family and power. And Larry Hagman portrays petroleum magnate J.R.

2068975,4,B00028G7LG,"After recently purchasing the wonderful Season 3 of Dallas, I revisited my Season 1/2 DVD from last year. Rewatching the pilot episodes again was interesting.  Southfork was a completetly different looking home to what we see in future episodes. JR and Sue Ellen lived in a little home opposite the main house, and the driveway was completely different. Garry's quarters are shown directly opposite the ranch, and JR commented that Val and Garry lived there for a bit after they were married.  What is even more interesting is that Season 1 (pilot) was filmed during the Texas winter. This created a totally different atmosphere to all other seasons which were filmed in summer.

Season 1/2 DVD is worth owning, but  the acting from many of the cast is dismal at times.  Charlene Tilton easily the weakest link.  The storylines are generally a little patchy, but if you can overlook these, then the DVD is pretty good value - 29 episodes for a decent price.

DVD FEATURES: Picture quality is average, and no restoration has been undertaken by WB.  International versions of the DVD do not include the Soaptalk special feature which can be found only on the American release.",1125100800,4,1174,4.864321608040201

2068978,5,B00028G7LG,"I was born in the '80s, never really got into shows like this until a few years ago. I've always thought ""Dallas"" to be one of those adult shows that wouldn't appeal to someone younger like me. Yet, after seeing this first box set, I'm impressed by ""Dallas"" and see why it stood out during it's run.

The first season was well written and well put together. I don't see any point, like some reviewers, in basically spoiling what Dallas is and what will happen to some of these characters, but I think as season 2 went on, the series really picked up. So much happened in these first two seasons that it's hard to imagine what else COULD happen with these characters. J.R. definately stands out as the guy you just can't stand but who really keeps the series together. Linda Gray as Sue Ellen, J.R.'s loving but desperate housewife, truly is the definition of ""must see t.v.""

What else is good about the first two seasons? All of the characters have their moment. Even Lucy gets her fair share of the spotlight as one of the younger characters. Miss Ellie, the mother and wife of the patriarch, Jock, is interesting to watch as well. It's entertaining to watch all of these characters interact with one another, and how no story-line really goes without being brought up later in the series. Great continuity, which makes this a really strong show and makes the stories even stronger.

Tina Louise, Kate Mulgrew and probably a few more actors appear in these first two seasons, the true mark of a soap opera with relevance. There were no moments when things really got out of hand or when the plot jumped the shark. It starts out rather slow and a bit dull but as the realization came that this show was going to be around for a while, you can tell because the writing got better. It never wasted a moment or opportunity, really getting in there and taking chances with the plot and the characters.

Like it's spin-off ""Knots Landing"" and ABC's ""Dynasty,"" this show is a must-see. It's television history in the making, grappling with big issues (including homosexuality) and going places that most shows during that time didn't feel safe going into. If you like quality drama, witty writing, and soap-opera moments, this is for you. Into ""Desperate Housewives""? Again, you'd probably like this because the women of ""Dallas"" definately were desperate in their own ways and had some real great moments on screen.

In these early days of the show, you got to see much more of Jock Ewing at the office (actor Jim Davis, of course, died later in the series' run) and how he influenced J.R. in his own conniving. We also loved seeing Tina Louise of ""Gilligan's Island"" return to television as Jock's ill-fated assistant, Julie Grey. (Ironically, her ""Gilligan"" costar Russell Johnson would appear later in a smaller role.) And if there was another prevailing theme of this early slice of the show, it had to be ""poor, put-upon Sue Ellen.""

Dallas is one television show that is a ""must see"" for any prime time soap opera aficionado.

In fact I was thrilled. I'd forgotten how good this show was! ""Dallas"" has been gone for years, and what pops into your head when you think about it now is the bad stuff, the shower/dream episode, all the cast changes, the mess that ""Dallas"" became in the late 1980's. Well, most TV shows that last a long time (14 seasons) don't end anywhere near their best, and ""Dallas"" is no exception. But the nice thing about releasing shows like this on DVD is that you can choose to remember it in its brilliant early form by only buying those years.

Seasons one (a 5-episode mini-series, actually) and two (24 regular episodes) are EXCELLENT! The characters were fully developed from the first moment: J.R. was a gleeful schemer with no morals whatsoever to slow him down, Sue Ellen was Lady MacBeth lite, Jock was a tough straight-talker, Bobby was a slightly naive but increasingly savvy man with a conscience, Pam was...the most gorgeous human being on television, frankly, but also an interesting character in her own right, a middle-class girl with an alcoholic father (David Wayne of ""Adam's Rib"" fame) who made the big time and has to constantly defend herself against accusations of social climbing. The show was a one-hour blast of great melodrama, entertaining and fun, its multiple storylines taking off in crazy directions that carried on for weeks at a time, setting the stage for the likes of ""Dynasty"", ""ER"" and even ""Seinfeld"".

2068987,4,B00028G7LG,"These days I watch a lot of television, but that wasn't always the case. When I was growing up I watched very little television. Although Dallas premiered when I was only two years old, it ran for 13 years, well into my teenage years, but I never saw an episode of the show.

Recently, however, I have become a fan of the primetime soap opera genre, thanks in large part to The O.C. and Dawson's Creek. I wanted to take a look at just where this genre came from and I needed to look no further than the first and second seasons of the CBS show Dallas.

The sprawling story lines and characters that you love to hate make this show a great addition to my DVD collection.

The first two seasons consist of 29 episodes. The first season was five episodes, originally run as a miniseries, and then a full complement of 24 episodes in season two. In those 29 episodes, you get all of the manipulating, back stabbing, drinking, cheating and shady business deals that you could possible need.

The success of this show, in my mind, was built around the character of John Ross (JR) Ewing Jr., played to perfection by Larry Hagman. JR is the original character that everyone loves to hate. His sleaziness and strong-armed business tactics make him a dispicable person, but it is that quality that makes him a great television character.

At the other end of the spectrum is Bobby Ewing, played by Patrick Duffy. He is JR's younger brother and tends to run the more honest side of the fence. He often has to go back and fix JR's problems and more than once serves as family mediator between JR and other members of the family. Of course, Bobby isn't without problems, as he marries Pamela Barnes, the daughter of his father's arch enemy, Digger Barnes. Played by Victoria Principal, Pamela is torn between her love for her husband and the committment to her family, namely her brother Cliff (Ken Kercheval) who is out to destroy the Ewing oil empire.

The Ewing patriarch, John Ross (Jock) Ewing Sr. is played by Jim Davis. Formerly the head of Ewing Oil, he now spends his time running the family's ranch, Southfork. He is still involved in the business, but only when he thinks that his sons need straightening out. His wife Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes) serves as the calming force in much of the show, keeping the family men on the sane side of the tracks (if that is possible). When Miss Ellie speaks, everyone listens.

JR's wife Sue Ellen, played by Linda Gray, is a former Miss Texas who becomes pregnant during the second season with Cliff Barnes' baby, although JR still believes the child is his for most of the season. Sue Ellen's drinking leads her down a dangerous road and JR eventually makes a tough decision in the final few episodes of the season.

Young Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) is the beautiful daughter of the middle Ewing son, Gary, who no longer lives on Southfork. She finds trouble of her own throughout the seasons, as she becomes addicted to drugs, gets engaged to a gay man and even runs away at one point during the season. At the start of the show, she is in a ""relationship"" with the ranch foreman at Southfork, Ray Krebbs, played by Steve Kanaly.

This show certainly has some over the top story lines, that are pretty unbelievable, but that is what often makes a soap opera what it is. This set is a great look at where the primetime soap opera really got its start. The dysfunctional family, questionabe business dealings and other myriad of problems are still prevalent in the genre to this day.",1108080000,2,3521,4.567353407290016

Larry Hagman as the evil genius brother J.R. is probably the best ""bad guy"" on television, and Linda Gray as the alcoholic former beauty queen keeps getting more and more depraved as the episodes roll on.  Jim Davis is appropriately gruff and grizzled as the patriarch of the clan.

The editing, music, fashion and dialogue on this show is seriously priceless, partly because of the twenty-odd years that has passed, but also because of the pure shamelessness of it all.  This is completely entertaining and engrossing--I can't wait for season three and the whole ""Who Shot J.R.?"" saga to begin!

Even if you've never watched ""Dallas"", there's nothing airing today that remotely compares to this quintessential example of trash TV--highly recommended!",1107993600,2,1305,4.944954128440367
2068989,5,B00028G7LG,I was so exctied when I received this. I quickly put it in my DVD player and watched the whole entire season 1 back to back. It brought back alot of memories. Some of the episodes I have not seen since they originally aired.  I forgot how good the show was and the wrighting was way before it's time.  It was funny to see how far technology has come. Like how no one on the show had a cell phone. I can't wait until season 3. Season 3-6 are probally some of the best.  I hope they release Knots Landing soon on DVD.  Dallas is a must for all great TV buffs the show changed the expectations of night time drama!!,1105488000,5,612,4.033057851239669

It's all there for your viewing pleasure:  The gruff Jock Ewing and dowdy Miss Ellie, the hilariously evil and womanizing J.R., the pathetic drunken Sue Ellen, the wonderful love story of martyr Pam and her dashing heroic Bobby, and the warped [and incestuous] coupling of randy Ray Krebbs and underaged Lucy.  I had not remembered that Cliff Barnes started out as a normal and noble ambitious guy.  The original Digger Barnes should have won an emmy for his comedic portrayal.  I loved it all!  I can't wait for the subsequent seasons!  [Hopefully they'll add some commentary by Patrick Duffy, Victoria Principal, and Linda Gray to future installments.]",1104796800,6,814,4.798561151079137

However I was really disappointed to not be able to locate the Soaptalk feature that was advertised on the cover. I note that Andy who is also from Australia where I am too couldn't find it either, so I have a horrible feeling the region 4 discs don't contain this. If they're going to make it available in Australia with the same packaging as the US advertising Soaptalk - then give us the whole lot! I feel cheated, I was really looking forward to this special feature.",1103155200,3,637,4.398305084745763

This is the perfect set to give someone if they (like myself) love to have DVD marathons in their living room.  Bring on seasons three & four so I can get my fix of the ""Who Shot JR?"" story!

Okay, the commentary was kind of a snooze if you ask me, but better than nothing and I didn't know that the guy who created this wanted Knots Landing to be the first show CBS bought.  David Jacobs also talked about working for a show in the 70s called Family - haven't seen that one in years!

Hey, Warner Brothers, if you release Family and Knots Landing on disc, I WILL BUY THEM TOO!

Picture quality: Excellent  (a few artifacts but the series is more than 25 years old! vut them some slack.)

Sound: Excellent (as opposed to another reviewer, I had NO problems with having to adjust the volume between the index list and the episodes.)

Extra's: I enjoyed listening to the commentary from David Jacobs, Larry Hagman and Charlene Tilton.  It seems like they did have fun making the series and being together.  (Most of the cast see each other regularly to this day, according to Larry Hagman).

 I did, though, long for commentary from Patrick Duffy which was absent from this DVD.  Hopefully he will provide some in next installment season. (Patrick...please!!!)  :-)

The Soap Net interview extra was nice but the sound quality was odd.  I had to turn up the volume to hear the actors and hosts (They were barely audible), but when I turned up the volume to hear them, the audience applause was deafening! It's like the shows sound people had the 20 microphones in the audience and none on stage with the actors/hosts!!!

If anyone at Warner Brother's reads these: Please!!!!!-Release all 13 seasons along with the reunions ""JR Returns"" and ""War of the Ewings"" and the latest CBS reunion special (2004).  I'll be one of the first in line to buy them all!  And there are an army of fans who want them.  Thnak you!",1101945600,8,1378,4.679166666666666

2068996,5,B00028G7LG,"I got hooked on Dallas when it was being rerun on the Nashville Network. So I am so glad that they are releasing the seasons on DVD. I hope the whole series will get released on DVD! Here we have the pilot season, and season 1. It starts off with Bobby Ewing and Pam Ewing, who have just married. At first the show deals with the effect of their marriage on the rest of the Ewing family, since Pam was a Barnes and the Barnes/Ewing feud had been going on for years, making her unwanted and an outsider. It centers on their marriage, but soon you get to know the other characters. Including J.R. Ewing, the scheming businessman who would stop at nothing to get what he wants, and his wife Sue Ellen Ewing, the neglected wife who finds comfort in the bottle. Lucy Ewing, the daughter of Gary Ewing who is estranged from the family. She often feels neglected. Miss Ellie Ewing and Jock Ewing, the proud, but stern parents of J.R. and Bobby. Ray Krebbs, the ranchhand. Cliff Barnes, Pam's brother who has a bone to pick with the Ewings, namely J.R. Ewing. Each character is complex, and the writing is gripping and well done. The plots are well executed.

Some of the main plots in these seasons included Pam's miscarriage, Sue Ellen's affair with Cliff, Sue Ellen trying to have a baby and hold onto her marriage while walking the fine line between sobriety and intoxication. Jock's health crisis. Lucy's engagement to a gay man, and drug abuse. Only a few of the stories that are told, that invite you into the world of the Ewings. Not only is the writing well done, but you couldn't have picked a better cast.

Barbara Bel Geddes as Miss Ellie Ewing, Patrick Duffy as Bobby Ewing, Victoria Principal as Pamela Ewing, Ken Kercheval as Cliff Barnes, Steve Kanaly as Ray Krebbs, Jim Davis as Jock Ewing, Linda Gray as Sue Ellen Ewing, Charlene Tilton as Lucy Ewing and Larry Hagman as J.R. Ewing. The DVD set includes 5 double sided DVDs, including the first 5 episodes of the pilot season, and the  24 episodes from Season 1. There's also some bonus features like the Dallas Reunion on SoapTalk that aired recently.

I am now in withdrawal, anxiously awaiting the rest of the seasons to come out!  Hurry, please!  I know the studio can get these out more rapidly, after all, many of the shows of today already have tons of seasons out on them, so I don't think there is any excuse!

2069002,5,B00028G7LG,"DALLAS finally gets its first release on DVD, and it packs a giant ten gallon whallop.  The quality is fine considering the age of the show, and it looks like they did all they could to make the transfer look as clear as it could be despite the age of the sources.  The extras are also well done.  Commentaries from Larry Hagman (JR), Charlene Tilton, and the series creator are a lot of fun.  It's a blast to see how the series started, and how all the seeds for the future were planted from day one when Bobby Ewing brings Pamela Barnes into the family (despite a long-standing feud between the two names).  Yes, it's a take on ROMEO AND JULIET; however, the story also becomes a take on CAIN AND ABEL as the bad brother (JR) confronts the good one (Bobby).  DALLAS pioneered and revitalized a new glossy take on nighttime soap operas.  It was a Texas version of PEYTON PLACE, and predated Falconcrest and Dynasty.  Odd trivia is the producers wanted to launch KNOT'S LANDING first, but the network picked DALLAS to be the first series.  Only the first season was filmed entirely on location, and Southfork looks very different in its introduction than it would later on.

Own a piece of television and Texas history!  DALLAS was wildly popular, and if you're a fan this is a dream come true.  And its also the perfect way to discover what made the show so special if you never saw the first episodes.  It ran for 14 and a half seasons, and it's ""Who Shot JR?"" twist inbetween the 3rd and 4th seasons was the second highest rated show in television history.  Other strange trivia is Linda Evans was supposed to play Pamela Ewing, but decided she was not ""down home"" enough to pull it off.  Later she used her glamorous image to become the matriarch of DYNASTY (DALLAS's more glamorous minded successor to the nighttime soap throne).",1095120000,5,1834,4.531914893617022
2069003,5,B00028G7LG,"Overall, the Season 1 Box Set of Dallas is a fairly acceptable one.

The image and sound quality are (for the most part) very good and what limitations there are has to do with the original audio, video, and film elements they used to assemble the episodes rather then in the transfer itself.

Part of the problem with all the older TV shows that make the transition to DVD is that the production values of the past just weren't designed to meet the rigorous requirements that Digital Technology would later require.

The good news is that Larry Hagman agreed (or was asked) to provide commentary for some of the episodes.  The bad news is that they were also able to get Charlene Tilton who was useless and complete waste of time on-screen as Lucy and whose commentary I couldn't care less about. The really bad news is that (for whatever reason) they couldn't get Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy, Victoria Principal, or any of the other surviving cast members.  It would have been so nice to hear everyone comment on the experience of making the show and what they think about it when they see it now.

I didn't actually ever watch Dallas season to Season, and I didn't become a regular viewer until 1987 so I've got a lot of catching up to do and I hope they don't take too long to release the other seasons.

Watching this show from the beginning, I have a newfound respect for it and I can see why it was such a hit.  Even now, some of the stuff they did was pretty shocking.

One thing I didn't realize (until watching this set) was that the beloved South Fork Ranch that people (from all over the world) associate with this show only actually became used after the Pilot Miniseries was successful and went to series.  The original South Fork of the Pilot Miniseres was really depressing and gothic to look at whereas the one they used for the rest of the Series looked like Paradise On Earth.

All in all, a solid first offering.  Future offerings need to have  more commentary from more cast members on more episodes and they should also include the follow-up TV Movies as well as the E! True Hollywood Story on Dallas which was superbly done.",1094947200,9,2145,4.497422680412371

Not being a ""soap opera"" type person, no one was more surprised than I was when I got hooked on ""Dallas"" back in the late '90's when it was showing daily on TNN.  I saw all 13 years in about 18 months. I went into panic mode once when the TV went on the blink.  To say my life revolved around ""Dallas"" would be an understatement. And--- all the ribbing I took from my family-- they thought I had gone nuts.  My dream is to get the entire 13 years on DVD.  I sure hope it happens.

I recently read ""25 Years of Dallas"", and was surprised to learn that the writers wanted to kill Bobby at the end of the 5th. show.  Thank goodness they didn't.  As with most any show- it got better as it went along, and the charactors developed. So, I would recommend the DVD to any ""Dallas"" fan, and to anyone who has never seen the show.  And watch out-- it will be addictive.",1094169600,6,940,4.016129032258065
2069008,5,B00028G7LG,"This stylish Warner Brothers' five-disc set contains the inaugural 29 ""Dallas"" episodes (out of a total of 357 aired during the show's CBS-TV network run of 13-plus years), with every wheeling-dealing moment and bickering family feud Digitally realized via this great format known as ""DVD"". This set combines the so-called 5-episode ""Mini-Series"" with the first FULL season (1978-1979). So we're getting two seasons (sort of) in one collection here.

The series began on April 2, 1978, with ""Digger's Daughter"", which has Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) coming home to Dallas with new bride, Pam (Victoria Principal), in tow.  And seeing as how Pamela is ""Digger's Daughter"", we know we're not going to be experiencing a comfortable day at the beach from the get-go of this ultra-popular prime-time soap opera. Because, you see, ""Digger"" is not exactly thought too highly of around Ewing territory -- and vice-versa. A great debut episode!

Video and audio quality rate pretty good marks here (IMHO). Picture quality is kind of hit-&-miss in places, with some portions looking better than others. The opening credits are speckled with artifacts and grain (which seems to be common among a lot of TV-on-DVD products being produced; evidently many DVD companies don't go to the added expense to ""clean up"" the repetitive opening and closing credit sequences on many TV series).

Colors aren't super-bright on this DVD set, but they aren't extremely dull either. For the most part, I'd say the shows look and sound fairly good on these Digital Discs. A good representation of how the first seasons of ""Dallas"" looked when the episodes first aired on network TV.

The original Full-Screen television ratio (1.33:1) is used for these twenty-nine episodes; while audio comes from highly-adequate Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono tracks (English only). (The Audio Commentary tracks are in DD 2.0.) The distinctive opening theme music comes across very nicely here, via the 1-channel Dolby Digital audio. The booming ""Dallas"" theme is one of the best ever written for a TV series, in my opinion.

These ""Dallas"" programs are definitely presented here in their original full and UNCUT form, with a run time of approximately 48 minutes per episode. This running time *does* include the ""trailer"" clips at the beginning of each show, just as they were originally broadcast on CBS-TV in 1978 and 1979. However, the ""Next Week On Dallas..."" trailers (with clips of the next episode in the series) are not included on these DVDs.

Special Features:

>> ""Soap Talk: Dallas Reunion"" (42 minutes). This fun bonus feature serves up new (2003) interviews with members of the ""Dallas"" cast (Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, and Charlene Tilton). The four famous ""Ewings"" fondly reminisce about the show. The genuine affection these actors and actresses have for each other is quite readily apparent and easily shows through during this entertaining ""Soap Talk"" bonus. Video clips from various ""Dallas"" episodes are also shown during this program. Pretty good stuff.

>> Audio Commentaries for three episodes. Participating in the commentary tracks are Larry Hagman, Charlene Tilton, and series' creator David Jacobs. .... The three episodes featuring the commentary tracks are: ""Digger's Daughter"", ""Reunion (Part 1)"", and ""Reunion (Part 2)"".

>> Subtitles can be accessed in English and French, as well as Spanish.

>> A ""Play All Episodes"" option is included on all discs.

Packaging:

Warner Home Video gives us these 29 ""Dallas"" episodes in an attractive fold-out ""Digipak""  type of box, with some nice artwork adorning it. The inner case, which slides out very easily from its outer slipcover, securely holds the five double-sided discs. When all 5 discs are removed from their individual tray holders, a grandiose picture of the skyline of downtown Dallas emerges, with large letters (in the familiar font associated with this TV series) spelling out ""DALLAS"" laid over the top of the skyline image. Quite impressive indeed.

No booklet is included with this DVD set. Instead, episode information (with original CBS air dates) is shown on the various flaps of the inner disc-housing part of the package.

Menus:

The Menus are all static, with no lengthy animations of any kind. From the Main Menu, you can access Sub-Menus of: ""Episodes"", ""Languages"", and ""Special Features"" (on applicable discs). Selecting ""Play"" from the Main Menu will play all the episodes on that side of the disc. Discs 1 through 4 each contain three episodes per side. Disc 5 has three programs on Side A, and 2 shows (plus bonus material) on Side B. Each time you return to a disc's Main Menu, the rousing ""Dallas"" theme song plays all the way through (just like on the opening credits for every episode). The theme music repeats if the Main Menu remains on-screen.

Chapter breaks are included on all episodes, including a much-appreciated chapter stop immediately after the opening titles.

Watching these top-notch episodes again on DVD makes a ""Dallas"" fan yearn for the next installment in the series on Digital Disc, which will include the most famous ""cliffhanger"" in TV history -- when J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) falls victim to a bullet in episode 54, ""A House Divided"".",1094083200,52,5234,5.143698468786808
2069009,5,B00028G7LG,I used to enjoy this show. Ienjoyed the actors as well they did a good job. I definitely liked the drama and the suspense it was done very well. Dallas was a popular Television show and a lot of people watched it. The show had great production and actors. I liked Victoria Principal (Pam Ewing) who was married to Bobby Ewing and had a son named Christopher. But the most infamous one of the main characters J.R. Ewing (Larry Hgaman) the son of Mary Martin (Peter Pan). J.R. kept the drama going he and Sue Ellen duked it out so much . I really did enjoy this show and therefore I would recommend anyone who likes  Classic Soap Operas or Dramas to  purchase this item it is very enjoyable.,1094083200,2,689,4.333333333333333
2069010,5,B00028G7LG,"Living in a small town in Sweden, Dallas was the biggest thing to ever hit the TV screen in the early 80's. And I must say, after watching the pilot, i DO understand why it was such a big hit. It's got everything! Welth, intrigues, beauty, money and lots of drinking......

I have been waiting for the studio to release this series on DVD and now i cant wait to get the complete collection. I don't need anything else. DALLAS is it for me. :)",1093996800,2,442,4.2
2069011,1,B00028G7LG,"Ah, I purchased my first VCR in the early 80's with the specific intention of saving ""Dallas"" episodes. And save I did. With the advent of syndication I was able to catch up and maintain my entire ""Dallas"" library for the entire run.

IF conflict is the main ingredient of drama, then ""Dallas"" is steeped in it. From the introduction of the famous ""Ewing-Barnes Feud"" in Episode 1 (or ""Barnes-Ewing Feud"", depending on your point of view) it never lets up. Youngest son Bobby Ewing brings Pam Barnes home to Southfork as his wife, brother J.R. starts meddling, and it rolls from there. And oh how did the booze flow!

""Dallas"" will take you back to a time of pre-Internet, pre-dot-com 80's-style greed and avarice (well LATE LATE 70's for this set). Do you remember a time BEFORE cellphones and pagers (when the 'mobile phone' was the exclusive domain of the rich)? Do you remember when telephones rang with a real bell and ""sounded"" like a telephone? How about a time when monochromatic computer screens ruled? No answering machines or email? You'll see bell-bottom business suits and wide-collar- wide-belt leisure suits, platform shoes and Farah Fawcett hair styles (Tina Louise as J.R.'s secretary is a good example of the hair). How about a time when a Mercedes luxury car belonged only to the ""filthy rich""? The disco scenes at the new ""Braddock"" disco had us rolling on the floor laughing with the gratuitous 'butt-shots' of the dancing cast.  If you don't remember these things, buy the set, sit back, and enjoy. If you do remember those things, buy the set, sit back, and enjoy!

It's great to watch the first 5 'stand-alone' episodes evolve ito the episodic storyline-driven primetime soap it eventually became. I'm not sure if I fit the 'profile' of their target audience at the time, but ""Dallas"" had such a wide appeal that it was eventually copied by the likes of ""Dynasty"". (However, ""Dynasty"" never captured the real aura or essence that ""Dallas"" had, and in my opinion, ""Dynasty"" was just a hollow imitation.)

I love seeing the early episodes as they were shot entirely in Texas in what was obviously winter. SNOW, cold, and the breaths of the actors all add to the realism of it. The grass is brown, the wind blows (a LOT), cattle are auctioned, and that daggoned pickup truck has a lopsided front license plate. The later episodes, obvisouly shot in a sound stage/set in California, sort of lost that 'realism'.

Note: If you look close in one scene, you can even see the film crew and camera reflected in the passenger side window of Ray's pickup truck as it drives by (2nd or 3rd episode I think, where there appears to be lots of snow on the ground).

- One thing I could never figure out was how come Ray (who can fly a helicopter) works as a ranch-hand when he could be making more money flying (of course, it's revealed in later episodes that Ray IS Jock's son, from a WWII relationship in England when Jock was serving in the military. This sort of makes the Ray-Lucy relationship of the first few episodes odd, as Ray turns out to be Lucy's 'half-uncle' - and that prior relationsip is never mentioned on later episodes). In any case, it's interesting to watch each character evolve.

David Wayne believably plays Willard ""Digger"" Barnes, who blames all Evil in the world on Jock Ewing. Keenan Wynn somehow didn't pull that off in later episodes. Ted Shackelford does not play long-lost brother Gary in ""Reunion"" as some believe (since he played Gary in ""Knots Landing).

Here's a few things to do to make it even more interesting: count how many drinks are downed by the charcters in each episode. Start with Episode One and keep a running tally of how many times Bobby punches J.R. Keep a running tally of how many times Cliff gets beat down by J.R. (this one will be more relative in later episodes) or count how many gratuitous breast shots you see (""Dallas"" was famous for that one)...the possibilities are endless...If you really get interested in it, purchase one of the ""Dallas"" compendiums.

As to the technical issues of the DVD set:  I agree with previous reviewers regarding the quality of the film-DVD transfer. I would have expected a digital treatment where the scratches, dust, etc are removed, but this apparently has none. I also would like to point out the audio in many places needs a workover or enhancement. In many interior scenes, the audio has an overpowering, distracting hollowness to it. In many outside scenes, bird noises and cicadas overpower the actor's voices.

I would also have liked commentary from more of the cast members like Patrick Duffy, Victoria Principal, Steve Kanaly, Ken Kercheval, Linda Gray, etc - this set features commentary from Jacobs (series creator), Larry Hagman and Charlene Tilton). More special features like bloopers (if they exist) would be nice.

* Did you know there was also an album released of ""Dallas"" music and singing cast members?

I rate it 4 stars. I hope the audio/video transfer technical issues are corrected in future season set releases. All in all, it's very entertaining and for less than $40, worth the purchase price. It's a good addition to any DVD collection.",1093996800,8,5170,4.77491601343785

This is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest show to come out of the 1980s (yes, I know it began in 1978).  However, since this is a show that changed the TV landscape, you would think Warner Bros. would have enough respect to go back and clean up the old films.  Nope.  There is dust, scratches and debris all over this thing!  Though certain scenes looks great, esp. in terms of colors, others, especially the intro credits, look awful.  The sound was not fixed up or anything.  It looks like Warner Bros did NOTHING to remaster this material.  A true shame.  Such a WONDERFUL SHOW deserves a better transfer than this, however you can't beat the price.  I would be willing to pay more for a better set though.",1093910400,38,833,4.450331125827814

2069019,5,B00028G7LG,"I will be first in line to buy this DVD package.  Why?  Because Dallas is classic television.  The writing, directing and acting was purely entertainment and the stories were consistently engrossing and sometimes silly.  Who could forget Sue Ellen's affair with Dusty?  Or Pamela's aerobics classes?  Mandy and Sue Ellen fighting it out for J.R.'s hearts?  Sue Ellen's affair with Chris Atkins?  The Barrens Oil Ball where there was at least one fight (or catfight) per ball?

Dalls approached camp but it never went over the top like Dynasty which means that its episodes still retain the power they had throughout the '80s.  Perhaps it was not as witty or as well-written as the more sophisticated Knots Landing but it was able to retain strong dramatic structure throughout most of its run.

I think the work of Larry Hagman and Linda Gray was definitely overlooked.  They turned in consistently good performances, playing perhaps the most dysfunctional couple in television history pre-The Sopranos.",1093219200,6,1003,5.1234567901234565

The first two seasons laid the groundwork and as the show became more complicated, bizarre and brilliant it broke rules all the way. Did we care that Pamela dreamt a whole season or that Miss Ellie was played by a different actress and then the original one again - no, it was simply entertainment that defined a time before television would become fragmented, a time when we would all switch on and watch and then talk about it the next day. One thing, please also release the 'Dallas - the Early Years' the comeback episodes and the pilot - and release all of the seasons ASAP because we really want them, I hope there are lots of extras and the quality is good.",1092960000,18,1027,4.468085106382978

2069037,5,B00028G7LG,"First, you need to know that if you pick this up expecting to get to the famous ""A House Divided"" episode which ends with the cliffhanger of J.R. being gunned down in the offices of Ewing oil that sparked the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" mania of the summer of 1980 it is not to be found here.  While that episode did come at the end of the second season of ""Dallas"" this collection counts the five episode mini-series from 1978 as the ""first"" season with the 24 episodes of the first season now called the ""second.""  This explains why there are only 5 discs in this collection of ""Dallas: The Complete First and Second Seasons.""

It is easy to see how ""Dallas"" got on the air.  In the very first episode, ""Digger's Daughter"" (April 2, 1978), Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) is bringing his new bride, Pamela Barnes (Victoria Principal) home to the Ewing family ranch of Southfork.  She predicts that his family is going to throw her off the ranch and we soon learn why.  Once upon a time Pam's father Willard ""Digger"" Barnes (David Wayne) and John Ross ""Jock"" Ewing (Jim Davis), the patriarch of the Ewing clan, had been oil wildcatters in the great state of Texas.  When they struck oil Jock too both the company and the woman they both loved, Eleanor Southworth (Barbara Bel Geddes) away from Digger.

But not only do we have the whole Romeo & Juliet thing going on with Bobby & Pam, now Juliet is from the wrong side of the track.  Add to this that Juliet has a brother, Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), who is the legal counsel for a government investigation gunning for Ewing Oil, and that the foreman of Southfork, Ray Krebs (Steve Kanaly) is Pam's old beau.  Ray is also sleeping with you Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton), who is the daughter of the absent Ewing son, Gary (David Ackroyd).  Of course if you watched the show when it aired you now how twisted the Ray-Lucy bit becomes down the road, but that does not matter because we still have to talk about J.R. and Sue Ellen.

This time around Romeo has an older brother who was a human oil slick that viewers loved to hate.  John Ross ""J.R."" Ewing (Larry Hagman) was power hungry and unscrupulous, whether it was with regards to the business interests of Ewing Oil or with his personal life.  If Bobby and Pam were Romeo & Juliet, then J.R. and Bobby were Cain and Abel.  By the end of the first episode J.R. is trying to have Pam caught in a compromising position with Ray so he can through ""Ms. Barnes"" off of Southfork and the mini-series ends with J.R. making sure that Pam does not produce the first Ewing grandson.  Of course, since J.R. and his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), the former Miss Texas, and having a contest to see who hates the other one the most, their having a child first does not seem to be a real possibility.

Actually while ""Dallas"" resonates with Shakespearean and Biblical elements, series creator David Jacobs, who had been the story editor on ""Family,"" was inspired by Ingmar Bergman's Swedish mini-series ""Scenes From A Marriage,"" which an executive at CBS suggested Jacbos should move up the social ladder The mini-series was enough of a success that ""Dallas"" came back as a regular series in 1978-79.

The season begins with prodigal son Gary returning to Southfork with his wife, Valene (Joan Van Ark) and J.R. conniving to drive him away.  Then Bobby's childhood sweetheart Jenna Wade (Morgan Fairchild) shows up with a daughter, Charlie (Laurie Lynn Myers) who may be his, Jock has a heart attack, Sue Ellen tries to adopt a baby on the Black Market, Pam's first husband (Robin Clarke) shows up claiming they are still married, Lucy runs away, Cliff runs for the state senate, a plane carrying Bobby and J.R. crashes, Ray becomes smitten with country singer Garnett McGee (Kate Mulgrew), Bobby tries a business venture with old friend Guzzler Bennett (Richard Kelton), Bobby gets kidnapped, Elle gives Southfork to her brother Garrison (Gene Evans), Jock's former secretary Julie Gray (Tina Louise) shows up dead and J.R. tries to frame Cliff for the murder, and Sue Ellen's sister Kristin Shepard (Colleen Camp) makes a play for Bobby, Pam and Bobby separate, J.R. tries to marry Lucy off to Kit Mainwaring (Mark Wheeler), and Ray has an affair with Donna Culver (Susan Howard).

However, the second season comes down to the fact that Sue Ellen has an affair with Cliff Barnes and then finds out she is pregnant offering us the delicious irony that the first Ewing grandchild could be a Barnes and not a Ewing.  But Sue Ellen, afraid to leave J.R. starts drinking hard and heavy (even by Ewing standards).  J.R., figuring that the child is not his but fearing what would happen to his reputation and the Ewing name if the truth comes out, has his wife committed to a sanitarium.  Even there Sue Ellen manages to keep on drinking and the season ends with her in the hospital and the life of the baby in danger. To be continued...

The main advantage of ""Dallas"" as a nighttime soap opera was that the show really kept things moving.  Arguably as much happened in a season of this show as you got in a year with a daytime soap opera but jammed into two-dozen episodes.  More importantly, even if you do not care about Pam and Bobby, who refuse to live happily ever after, there is cunning J.R. sticking his finger into each and every pie.  The year after this ""second"" season, ""Dallas"" finishing 6th in the Nielsens with a 25.0 rating.  The series would finish 1st three of the next four seasons including a 34.5 rating the year we found out ""Who Shot J.R.?"" (Only one television show has average a rating over 30.0 since then, ""The Cosby Show,"" 1985-87).",1085788800,133,5630,4.608608608608608

Starting from the very beginning all actors were perfectly cast for their characters. And the awesome presence of Jim Davis (who sadly passed away in 1981) in the first years of the show, and his solid portrayal as Jock Ewing was, amidst this all-star cast, a feast for the eye. Love, action, betrayal, misunderstandings and above all the tightness of the Ewing family made this a cult show that today is still as powerful to watch as when it was released more than 25 years ago.

2069040,5,B00028G7LG,"Those words cannot begin to describe the illustrious 13 year run of CBS' mega-hit ""Dallas"".  Premiering as a five part mini series in 1978, ""Dallas"" proved to be a big hit and became apart of classic television.  ""Dallas"" sparked a PM soap craze; it spun-off ""Knots Landing"" and paved the way for many other (fun and exciting) imitators (""Dynasty"", ""Falcon Crest"", ""Flamingo Road"")  It showed us sex, power, money, and J.R. Ewing.  Don't make him have to manipulate you into ordering this set!
This show had one great cast of actors:  Barbara Bel Geddes, Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Victoria Principal, Ken Kercheval, Steve Kanaly, Charlene Tilton, and the incomparable Jim Davis.  Many other great actors would join the show later on, but these people started it all for us.
Although most episodes in these first ""two"" seasons are of a self-contained format (conflict begins and ends in one ep.), the writers immediately give us some great moments no matter what.
There is no reason why anyone who collects TV shows on DVD should not have this in their collection.  Let's let all seasons of ""Dallas"" be released onto DVD.  If it sells really well, we may get to see who shot J.R.!",1084838400,14,1194,4.818627450980392
