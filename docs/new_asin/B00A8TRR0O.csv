5401109,3,B00A8TRR0O,"Honestly, nothing great.  It appeared that someone bought a movie & dubbed it with a whole new script.  If you've read the synopsis, then watch this, you will understand.  Quite boring.",1425340800,,185,4.903225806451613
5401110,4,B00A8TRR0O,"Do you love kickass cheesy 80s sword and sorcery flicks like Ator, Deathstalker, and Beastmaster?  Sweaty action epics filled with muscle-bound barbarians, beautiful women, magic, swordfights, revenge, violence, monsters and lots of atmosphere? Well then, you've come to the right place my friend. A place of warriors and power...

After both his parents are brutally murdered by his fathers rival Gnut and his men the new born Thor is placed in hiding by the physical embodiment of the god Teisha. Raised in secret under the guidance of Teisha, Thor comes to maturity and goes on a quest to avenge the death of his parents and return peace to his lands.

Thor the Conqueror is a low budget 1983 fantasy film based around a warrior named Thor who lives in prehistoric like times. The movie is dubbed and the action is mediocre. Low budget, but fun b movie. Fans of cult cinema, fantasy, and barbarians should check out this hidden film

Directed by Anthony Richmond, 1983, Italy, dubbed into English, 85 mins., Rated R",1422403200,4,1018,4.867052023121388
5401111,4,B00A8TRR0O,"When taken together with the other entries in the genre, Thor the Conqueror has a kind of weird charm. Truth be told, the film drags quite a bit, and lacks any kind of hook beyond Thor's bizarre birdman mentor [a rude dude with a bad 'tude, who instructs our impressionable nave on the warrior's path of misogyny]. However, for those of us who can't get enough of threadbare Italian Conan ripoffs, Thor delivers the goods - endless fights with weird guys in impractical helmets defending ramshackle stick buildings, intercut with treks through gorgeous [if indifferently shot] vistas, and the occasional uncomfortable scene of Thor pawing at some poor barbarian lady. There's very little in the way of FX or set pieces here, just an unpleasant and unrelenting atmosphere of mistrust and fear.

The print looks like a widescreen video master, which accounts for the ""full frame"" listing on the case. As far as these things go, it's not the best copy, but far, far from the worst, and hardly merits the defensive preface that comes up before the film. That bit reminded me of Simitar's old, disingenuous VHS disclaimers about adjusting your tracking to account for ""the age of these films.""

Because this is a Full Moon disc, we also get loads of promo junk including a risible plug for ""haunted casino"" merch, and an 8 minute intro where Charles Band talks about his definition of grindhouse films. I'll be honest and say I skipped it for the feature.",1419638400,14,1450,4.819277108433735
5401112,4,B00A8TRR0O,"If you are a sexist cannibal barbarian caveman lover, this movie is for you. I'm not going to say that I didn't like it because I got a kick out of it and the english dub isn't bad for an italian made sword and sorcery flick. They certainly can't make them like this anymore.",1408320000,4,275,4.111111111111111

8548470,3,B00A8TRR0O,"This is a very odd curio in the sword and sorcery genre.  Its the sad tale of Thor, barely born when hes shot with an arrow, his dad receives two, and mom is killed off screen with a sword.  But!  He has a guardian angel of sorts, a bizarre owl who likes to narrate everything in asides.  When hes not an owl, hes a weird dude with a board for shoulder pads.  He constantly complains that hes old and on deaths door, yet hes there to the bitter end, refusing to go awayyap-yap-yapping.  Poor Thor eats most things raw, fights and kills everyone/anyone, doesnt matter.  He wields weapons that don't look like they could cut cheese.  Bad wigs abound, everyone, at some point, indulges in a cackle.  The acting is uniformly bad.  The dialog is severely limited in every way imaginable.  This is a remarkably dull movie.  And yet, in all its awfulness, there is a certain undefinable something that makes it almost a viewing pleasure.",1523318400,,930,4.536144578313253
8548471,1,B00A8TRR0O,"If you want entertainment, good acting, nudity, or quality, this isn't going to be what you want.  The case is re-usable, but other than that, spend your money on something else.  Nobody listens to me anyway, go ahead and buy this video.
Get several copies in fact.  Hand them out to your friends and family.  Great stocking stuffer, Christmas is coming you know.
Have a contest with your friends and see who can buy the most copies of this video and drop them off all over town.  Sneak them into pawn shops and just put it onto the shelf without asking for the fifty cents.
Have your kids take a copy to school with them and give it to the teacher or principal and have the kids say they found it out by the edge of the parking lot.
There is a good DVD inside this case, tie fishing twine through the center hole and hang it from a low hanging tree limb to scare birds out of your garden.
People who say this movie has no value obviously have never used this movie in skeet shooting as a substitute for the clay pigeon.
Ladies - if you want your male friends to appreciate you - buy them one of these videos.  Buy them 2 copies.  I know you want to.  Go ahead.",1508025600,,1161,4.174887892376682

8548476,3,B00A8TRR0O,"If you're a fan of atrociously bad 80s fantasy B-movies loaded with the worst fight scenes, depictions magic, occasional sexploitation, and creature effects eversee it.  If you have to ask, this probably isn't for you.

Im not gonna lie.  I bought this on an intoxicated Amazon shopping spree several years ago and have been dreading the day that I finally decide to watch it.  Well, today is that day!  Director Tonino Ricci (Cave of the Sharks, Night of the Sharks) and writer Tino Carpi (Tentacle, Warriors of the Wasteland), who have probably never made anything good between both their careeres, have provided our ultra-classy viewing enjoyment for the evening.

We start by meeting a barbarian who looks like a caveman Weird Al Yankovic, his wizard companion and his pregnant wife.  After she scurries off into the bushes to give birth they are ambushed and face some of the silliest sword fighting ever.  For real, LARPers are more lethal with foam weapons than these idiotic berserkers.  After the barbarian father is killed by some kind of evil bad guy leader with an arrow through the neck, the wizard casts some spell to magically teleport himself and newborn baby Thor to safety.  Evidently he couldn't be troubled to try to save the mother or anyone else with his sorcery.  He later demonstrates some magical abilities that could have come in handy in saving Thors parents!

Thor (Bruno Minniti; A Man Called Rage, The Porno Killers) is raised by the wizard, who apparently taught him swordsmanshipbecause wizards are known for that skill setand not magic.  Go figure.

After a couple destitute action sequences his wizard surrogate dad pulls an Obi-Wan and turns permanently into an owl (for really no reason at all) to oversee Thor attaining his destiny, which apparently involves reclaiming his murdered fathers sword.  Id again like to point out the power of this wizard and how he could have saved Thors family or simply accomplished Thors stupid quest on his own with ease.  He was casting spells from the afterlife, so he could have teleported Thor to the sword, and that would be it.  Boom: movie.

On his generally vague journey Thor is charged with fighting some women, escaping a tribe of primitive natives, meeting his hardly-clothed captive-turned-girlfriend Ina (Maria Romano; Violence in a Womans Prison, Womens Prison Massacre), defeating his fathers murderer Gnut (Raf Baldassarre; The Killer Wore Gloves), and presumably engaging is forcefully non-consensual intercourse with two womenat the wizards encouragement to completely disregard the womens rights or choice in the matter!  But hey, theres consensual sex, too.

So what makes this a bad movie?  Here are a few clues:
1. Thors first scenes have him speaking like Tarzan.  Then later he talks normally.  Then back to Me, Thor. You bad guy.  No clue why.
2. His wizard adopted-father basically tells him to have his way with a scantily clad woman.  Go on and rape her, son.  Geez... classy.
3. Theres violence against women.  Thor straight up breaks a warrior womans neck while choking her out, then knocks a woman down and fondles her.  Im so embarrassed to have seen this movie! SMH
4. Your drunk, overweight, Dungeons and Dragons-playing friends who have never been in a fight could stage better fight scenes than I witnessed in this POS movie.
5. A sword turns into a snakethen nothing happens!  Apparently, a shot of a snake doing nothing was considered a big deal to the filmmakers.  I just scratched my head, chugged a beer, and tried to get on with my life.
6. Later Thor milks snake venom from a clearly non-venomous snake.
7. Boobs.  This is basically a mild exploitation movie.  And, like in Sorceress (1982), our protagonist has never seen the opposite sex.  Yet when exposed, he knows EXACTLY what to do with bare boobs!
8. Scan through this review and read the parenthetically annotated movies the cast, writer and director have done.  Pure drudgery!
9. Needlessly scantily clad women.  Im not complaining, though.
10. The wizard likes to watch and boy is it creepy.
11. Thor is given the first ever horse in a world that has never witnessed mounted combat. So he rides it to the fight, then dismounts.  Idiot!

This movie is terrible in so many ways.  But like many bad movies, if you go in knowing what you're in for, it might be exactly what you wanted.  So sit back, have a few beers, and join a friend in watching one of the worst fantasy flicks of the 80s.",1469923200,3,4462,4.851851851851852
