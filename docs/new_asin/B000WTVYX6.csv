2991780,4,B000WTVYX6,"I first rented this video from Netflix. The first section gives a good overview of arthritis that would be particularly useful for someone newly diagnosed. Good, general tips on risk factors, aggravating factors and taking an integrated approach to treating arthritis. I'm pretty comfortable with general nutrition tips, so I didn't find the second section very helpful. The meditation and yoga section were useful enough that I'm buying my own copy. The yoga was highly modified for folks with joint problems. Most is done on a chair. I found it very comfortable to do.",1243296000,64,570,5.074468085106383
