3616912,5,B001GMZGMI,"For many years the victims of Father Maciel sought justice only to find discredit, harassment, intimidation, embarrassment. Here is some testimony of the upsetting abuse suffered by many by someone they trusted and even loved. The manipulations of very powerful father Maciel and many in the Catholic Church whose main concerns were increasing their wealth and influence not the well being of idealistic, trusting, well intentioned young men. The  evidence of the cult-like brainwashing of many. As one of the victims says ""it is difficult to know where madness ends and evil begins"".",1237766400,12,584,5.279569892473118
3616913,5,B001GMZGMI,"Since the Legion has now admitted the pedophilia and Sexual abuse of the Founder of the Legion Fr. Maciel probably did take place due to the high number of reported cases  [...] I took the opportunity to review this documentary  Vows of Silence in the light of the revelations that the legion confirmed this year. I find it harrowing that these victims (Juan Vaca, Jose Barba and others) who raised these issues so many years ago did not get the opportunity for justice while Fr. Maciel was alive. I knew the Legion from inside as a member, I personally did not experience any abuse, and my experience was very positive. I remember the Legion tell us as legionaries that the allegations raised by Juan Vaca and Jose Barba and other were an attack on Fr. Maciel and his reputation and they they were groundless. I now feel deeply betrayed by this. And the legion will have to answer for the way the victims were victimized a 2nd time when they finally took the courage to speak the truth. We need to look at the objective facts that are raised in the Documentary.
As Legionaries we were made swear private vows as follows,  ""Never to criticize externally either the acts of government or the person of any Director or Superior of the Congregation by word, in writing or in any other way.  And if he knows for certain that a religious has broken this commitment, to inform the latter's immediate Superior, unless he was the one criticized, in which case the Superior above him should be informed"" In 1998 when the abuses were reported to the Media we were not allowed to discuss them internally as Legionaries, we were given the Legionary version that it was an attack on the good name of Fr. Maciel, and that was all we were told. We could not read the newspaper, speak among ourselves or question the Legion of Fr. Maciel.

I do not agree that the Legion is a Cult or a Sect. That was not my experience. I was not brainwashed. They do a lot of good work in the Church and there are many many excellent and faithful Priests in the Legion. However the governing structures and private vows that Fr. Maciel implemented meant he kept the Legion afloat for many years and placed a barrier to arriving at the truth about him and his private Life. I think the video was well prepared and hope that the victims of Fr. Maciel can finally find peace.",1237248000,17,2340,4.496470588235294
3616914,5,B001GMZGMI,"At this very moment the Catholic media is in a feeding frenzy with news that Fr. Maciel had a female lover and had at least one child now in her 20s. This recent revelation made by the Legionaries of Christ has led many to re-examine the accusations of sexual abuse of his seminarians previously brought against Fr. Maciel. The DVD, updating the story told by Renner and Berry in their investigative report, Vows of Silence, tells the story of these accusations; it personalizes the accusations by interviewing the survivors, describes the controling atmosphere which facilitated such abuse, and it explains the tedious process they have gone through for years to have their case heard by the highest authorities in the Catholic Church. Benedict XVI finally censored Maciel in May 2005; but was it enough and why did it take so long, and why did the Vatican say so little about the survivors and try to save the perpetrator's work, the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi?",1234137600,20,976,4.850299401197605

8306223,5,B001GMZGMI,"Wow! That was seriously intense and disturbing. I have known a number of people hurt over the years from their involvement with RC locally, but none that were this horrific. I also have friends still very much involved with them (& sad that their local RC school is shutting down this year), but I can't imagine a defense after watching this movie that is reasonable. Illuminating",1470873600,,380,4.7727272727272725
8306224,4,B001GMZGMI,"This is a pretty good documentary. It is definitely more of what I would call a ""made for Tv"" documentary. If you are into more hard-hitting expose' documentaries, then this one might not be for you. Most of what this film presents, is information that could be gleaned from reading a few newspaper articles on the subject. There was no in depth reporting here.

What this film does have a fair amount of, is church history. It also provides quite a lot of information with regards to the organization known as the Legion of Christ.

Although the subject matter of this documentary is unpleasant, and there are many ways in which one could approach it, this is a film that you could easily watch in the company of your conservative grandmother, I did not find it to be offensive in the slightest. and not blush. This is a good film for someone who is unfamiliar with the catholic church and how it operates.  It does a good job of exploring the relationship between the parishes themselves and the Vatican City. It would appear, in many of the cases presented, that the outside rules don't apply once youv'e stepped inside. That the Vatican City truly is a city unto itself.

Overall, I would say this film is a good introduction to the subject matter and the structure of the church itself, and it's relationship with the Vatican City. If you find this subject matter interesting, you will likely be compelled to look for other resources to explore. This film is really just a brief overview that begins to scratch the surface of the real issues at hand.",1460073600,,1555,4.6231884057971016

8306230,5,B001GMZGMI,"I don't want to say that I enjoyed this film, mostly because the subject matter is such that it is not enjoyable.  It is the story how Marcial Maciel Degollado, LC, founder of one of the most successful new movements in the Catholic Church, managed to pull off an amazing deception whilst at the same time doing such utterly horrendous things.

I consider myself to be a fairly conservative Roman Catholic.  I have to admit that when the accusations were first aired, I was not inclined to believe them.  After all, the Legionaries were championed by priests who I respected, especially Fr Richard John Neuhaus.  After 2006, when Pope Benedict XVI ""invited"", or on the other words, mandated Father Maciel to live a live of prayer and penance and to relinquish all active ministry, I knew that there was more than a semblance of truth behind the accusations.

To be honest, I was turned off by the progressive Catholicism championed by Berry and Renner in their book.  That doesn't mean that it shouldn't read, though.  I like this film, mostly because it focuses solely on the sordid tale of Father Maciel. Unfortunately, the tale became much more sordid as time went on.  Perhaps an updated version could be made, one which also captures the tragic tale of Maciel's children.  This film also does us a great service by allowing us to hear the words of Maciel's victims.  These men are not some crazy bunch of radicals.  In many cases, these are highly accomplished and respectable men.  I only wish that the Church had listened to them sooner.

I'm grateful that I never got caught up in the Legion.  I'm truly saddened for Maciel's victims. In some sense, I don't want the Legion or indeed the Church to forget the story of Father Maciel.  It should stand as a cautionary tale.",1304294400,4,1779,4.690322580645161
