1422638,5,B00005BCK9,"It's difficult to write an objective review about a film that I'm so enthusiastic about, but there's no getting around it-- I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time, so I'll just forge ahead.  The film is ""State and Main,"" written and directed by David Mamet, and arguably his best effort since 1987's ""House Of Games.""  When a movie company invades the sleepy hamlet of Waterford, Vermont, for a location shoot, complete with big name stars Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin) and Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) in tow, it creates quite a stir; and before it's over many of the townsfolk, as well as a few of those connected with the film, have learned some things about themselves-- and others-- they never knew before.  Things about honesty, purity and the moral flexibility inherent in many of those who reside here on planet Earth.  As a setting for the making of the film within the film-- which is about purity and second chances-- Mamet takes a page right out of Americana, complete with a Main Street, an historic firehouse, a quaint hostelry and even-- ""maybe""-- an old mill on a stream.  And in making a film about making a film about purity and second chances, he's made a film about purity and, well, second chances; a terrific character study that is forthright and sincere, and which rings with truth from beginning to end.  It's as honest as it is real, and so accessible that it makes an instant connection with the audience.  There are characters and situations here with which everyone will be able to identify in one way or another, all presented refreshingly and quite unpredictably.  Just when you think you see something coming from a mile away, you're treated to one of those famous Mamet ""twists"" that take you exactly where you didn't think you were going.  And Mamet does it so well that it's not only highly entertaining, but invigorating as well.  The cast he put together for this film is superlative, beginning with William H. Macy as Walt Price, the director of the movie.  A Mamet regular, Macy creates a character infused with that magic Mamet realism that helps establish the credibility of the film from the outset.  Baldwin is perfectly cast as the ""star"" with certain insatiable appetites and recreational needs, as is Parker, as the actress with a sudden case of ""issues"" regarding her contractual obligations.  And David Paymer does a solid turn as Marty Rossen, the producer of the film.  But the two actors who really make this movie tick are the charismatic Rebecca Pidgeon, and the versatile, multi-talented Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Pidgeon is absolutely captivating as Ann Black, the local who runs the book shop and directs the town's drama group (which includes just about everybody in Waterford, it seems).  She's winsome and charming, with a directness and vigor that is stunning; and she captures the very essence of Ann-- the intelligence and the compassion-- and conveys it convincingly to the audience.  It's a memorable performance, and one of the strengths (among many) of the movie.  The real star of the show, however, is Hoffman, as Joseph Turner White, the writer of the movie.  He gives an introspective performance filled with nuance and subtlety that is so real-- so pure-- that he single-handedly takes the film to a whole new level.  Like Meryl Streep, Hoffman has that chameleon-like ability that enables him to be anyone and everyone, yet always unique; it's a quality with which few actors are endowed, and he uses his gift to full advantage here, with his memorable portrayal of White.  Simply put, it's a great performance by a great actor, and one that should earn him an Oscar nomination.  The supporting cast includes Charles Durning (Mayor George Bailey), Clark Gregg (Doug), Patti LuPone (Sherry Bailey), Julia Stiles (Carla) and Ricky Jay (Jack).  Mamet has a style that make his films uniquely his own, and ""State and Main"" is one of his best.  Exceptionally well done and delivered, it's intelligent, funny and entertaining; an honest and succinct examination of human nature with an integrity at it's core that makes it a truly great film.  This is a prime example of what the magic of the movies is all about; a film that absolutely should not be missed.",980294400,16,4251,4.862690707350901
1422639,4,B00005BCK9,"I was fortunate enough to see the world premiere of this film at the Montreal World Film Festival and it was a riot. I laughed along with everyone else when I heard the spectacular cast shoot out very funny one-liners. But, maybe, if I had just seen this movie when it was released, I wouldn't have liked it as much. Maybe the rest of the crowd manipulated me into laughing... who knows. Still, William H. Macy delivers a performance that will have you rolling on the floor in tears, if your in the mood for a very humorous, dry satire about Hollywood taking over a small town. I've never been a fan of either Alec Baldwin or Sarah Jessica Parker, but I do gain respect for them, because they pull their roles off very well. So, if your in the mood for a light hearted satire about Hollywood, and are in the mood for a very well written screenplay, go see this little gem with epic performances.",977356800,,895,4.365269461077844

1422662,5,B00005BCK9,"A wonderful ""sleeper"" of a movie that was probably missed by most of us when it was first released. The unusual premise of a dysfunctional, somewhat shady and misbegotten film crew trying desperately make a movie with a mostly non-existent script and temperamental actors is carried off with sly humor and a touch of pathos. The characters played by Philip Seymour Hoffman (the overly intellectual screen writer) and William H. Macy (the unscrupulous, double-dealing director) perform a delightful pas de deux throughout the film, alternatively attractive and repellant to each other. I fell in love with Rebecca Pidgeon's sparky small-town renaissance woman who becomes attached to the hapless screenwriter and gently but firmly takes him in hand to help him write his farrago of a script. Sarah Jessica Parker and Julia Stiles also turn in great (if not typical of their usual roles) performances that add measurably to the sharp-edged humor of this dramady. One also needs to keep an eye open for more than a few sight gags and not-so-subtle satire of the movie-making business.",1453248000,,1081,5.1477272727272725

1422721,5,B00005BCK9,"""State & Main, directed and written by the legendary playwright and screenwriter David Mamet, is a very fine film much more punching on how Hollywood works and how it is fun and painful to watch how the fat-cats and the locals of Waterford, Vermont conflict in trying to make a film based on a play called, ""The Old Mill.""

Going to the film without any pre-existing awareness, it was probably one of the most recent and best experiences I have had in watching films lately. The largest thing that stood out for State & Main was the chaotic scripting and large cast featuring some very funny and intriguing, archetypical roles from William H. Macy as the frustrated director, the award-winning P. S. Hoffman as a nervous screenwriter, Alec Baldwin as a perverted actor, and the beautiful Rebecca Pidgeon as a friendly actor and a local. A whole lot goes on in the film (financing, getting a permit to film, trying to film at a firehouse, an actor getting arrested and in a car accident, a love affair, a tempered local politician, an actress intimidated by nudity) but for those who work in the industry, the humour will be much more potent and evident.

The writing scheme of it, while elaborate and very much sounding like ad-lib or throwabout, is genuinely executed with a glaring craft not found recently since Quentin Tarantino written and directed Pulp Fiction. The film's sense of wonder about how things go kaput when things do not go according to plan is most intriguing especially from the eyes of the timid Hoffman character, Joe White, who has an affair with Pidgeon's character, Ann Black. It is sweetly done and that bit stood out from all the chaos. Even with its positives, there is hardly anything wrong about the film aside from a short ending and some of the humour in it being a bit fairy-tale (but given Mamet's sense of direction, it is probably more driven on satire than anything).

If anything, I would definitely recommend this film to a film student, a film fan, an upcoming screenwriter, and anyone who loves the ""tale of two cities"" concept. There is so much going on and the way it is executed is without boredom or lack of confidence. It is all finely tuned much more than the 2007 Barry Levinson film, What Just Happened, which focused on the life of an executive film producer.",1378512000,2,2310,4.684729064039409

David Mamet writes brilliantly about the industry he knows so well.  P.S. Hoffman is at the top of his game, Alec Baldwin is his typical understated comic genius (the delivery of the ""So...THAT happened"" line is a clinic on comic timing and delivery, and should be taught in acting classes), Bill Macy is superb-no other word adequately can be used to describe his performance.  Sarah Jessica Parker and Julia Stiles are great in their supporting roles.  If you love movies, know a little about what you THINK goes on behind the scenes, WATCH THIS MOVIE!

1422739,4,B00005BCK9,"State & Main is an ensemble comedy written and directed by David Mamet (Glengarry Glen Ross). Though there are some big name stars, like Alec Baldwin and Julia Stiles, it is more of an Indie film, where the stars work for less for the chance to do some serious comedy acting. William H. Macy plays the director of the film within a film, Walt Price. His moral compass is very flexible.

To save money the film is being shot in a small town in Vermont, as the inhabitants are so star struck that they are being very accommodating. The mayor and his wife (Charles Durning and Patti Lupone) invite them to dinner, but after they carelessly blow it off, their permits begin getting revoked.

-----------------
Walt Price: Who designed these costumes? It looks like Edith Head puked, and that puke designed these costumes.
======================

Walt has a lot on his mind. Apart from the terrible costumes, his lead actor, Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), is more concerned with his hobby than learning his lines.

------------------
Bob Barrenger: I know my lines.
Walt Price: You do?
Bob Barrenger: I just don't know what order they come in.
=============================

Bob's hobby is jail bait. This will get him into a lot of trouble, especially once the director has stood up the mayor's lavish dinner; and the DA's (Clark Gregg) girl friend (Rebecca Pidgeon) has fallen for the writer, Joseph Turner White (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). When Bob Barrenger crashes his car while out with Carla (Julia Stiles), a young local woman, Joseph Turner White is the only witness to the accident.

--------------
Joseph Turner White: The girl was in the car.
Walt Price: I treated you like a son or a nephew.
Joseph Turner White: It's not about you.
Walt Price: No? What's it about, then?
Joseph Turner White: I have to tell the truth.
Walt Price: That, that is just so narrow!
====================

The DA's case hinges on White's testimony. But if he tells the truth, it will shut down production of the film--his big break. Also, he is not really that good of a writer, but just the fact that he appears to be a writer is enough to impress the literature-minded Ann.

------------------
Ann Black: ""If you were never down, how would you know when you were up?""
Joseph Turner White: You have a gift for words.
Ann Black: It's in your play.
============================

Black would actually be a much better writer than White. With David Mamet, however, you get all the shades of grey in between Black and White. Also worthy of mention are Sarah Jessica Parker as the co-star and David Paymer as the lawyer who comes to sort out the legal obstacles to the film's production.

The Bottom Line is that State & Main is a worthy effort, if not a major work, by writer/director David Mamet. If you like him and the cast of this film, and are up for a story about the grey areas and moral compromises involved in getting films produced, you will enjoy State & Main. It's not nearly as good as Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, though.

--------------
Walt Price: It's not a lie. It's a gift for fiction.

Overall, it didn't work for me. A movie crew takes over a small Vermont town, and even though this movie has a couple of big, expensive stars, they arrive on the scene without a script. No problem, they've brought along a script writer, who has had some experience writing plays. The male star, Alec Baldwin, is a notorious pedophile whose vice is tolerated by everyone. ""Everyone needs a hobby,"" is his excuse. The female star, Sarah Jessica Parker, is a typical prima donna. The script writer is a confused, conflicted, ambivalent mess, with no gift for verbal expression, and it is a wonder that he has achieved any success with his writing. The Vermonters do not come off as stereotypical, but they don't come off as normal, either. The big-city slickers are excessively vulgar, as if to underscore that they are big-city slickers. As a light comedy, this film has its moments, but since one theme of the film is about second chances, I would not watch this film a second time, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone even for a first time",1128211200,,1193,4.712918660287081
1422757,4,B00005BCK9,"It sure sounds familiar. A Hollywood film crew causes havoc in a small American town while filming a movie. It seems they were kicked out of a previous small town due to the lead actor's (Alec Baldwin), penchant for young teenage girls. And it's deja vu all over again.

What I liked about ""State and Main"" is it's treatment of the small town locals as being as sophisticated, savvy, and in the case ot the young teenage girl, promiscuous as the blindsided big city moviemakers, while never abandoning it's Rockwellian small town charm, or it's big city smarts. It's a perfect marriage of the two cultures clashing, never wallwoing in the expected morales and pathos of its conflict.

The ensemble cast takes David Mamet's witty and clever script and flesh out the characters to sharp edged precision and humor. William H. Macy is perfectly and forgivingly corrupt as the film's director, (he'd kill a horse to make a dead horse scene look real), and Rebecca Pidgeon radiates a secure small town confidence as the local book store owner forced to abandon her plans for a community play, while setting her sights on the film's morally conflicted writer.",1127433600,2,1152,4.842639593908629

1422760,4,B00005BCK9,"This gem of a movie was probably not a blockbuster when released. The storyline is thin and almost non-existent, it could be summed up as ""Everyone gets the chance to screw up  a second time"". Nevertheless, there are enough  twists and turns to make what story there is interesting.  This must be the sort of  movie that every good  actor and actress would love to have a role in  as the screenplay has been written by an accomplished playwright. It is a farcical melodrama rather than a comedy but nonetheless highly enjoyable.

A film-making team, hard up on critical funds, has just been thrown out of a small town in New Hampshire. Their  movie's plot necessitates the choice of a small town New England locale and a water mill (one reason why they are short of funds is that they had to build an old water  mill replica in the New Hampshire town).  As the movie begins The Director and his crew find themselves in a small town in Vermont (actually most of the scenes are shot in Connecticut or Massachusetts). The  beauty of the location is well-captured by excellent photography.  The  makers of  ""State and Main"" did not fall into the trap of shooting the  film during the Fall. New England  fall colours would be a major distraction although  Alfred Hitchcock's black comedy ""The Trouble With Harry"" succeeded despite being shot in Vermont at the peak of the fall  leaf colour season, but then Hitchcock was an exceptional genius.

The small town  has being going on in its leisurely way until the film crew arrive. The obvious star of  ""State and Main""  is Philip Seymour Hoffman a previously little known Hollywood actor whose first appeared on the screen as  the spoilt rich Daddy supported George Willis Jr. In that memorable Al Pacino film, ""Scent of a Woman"". Hoffman's key role in ""State and Main"" is as the author and screen play writer for the movie within the movie.  The better known Hollywood star Alec Baldwin  plays the lesser role of the film-in making's male star. He is portrayed as a lustful male whose sexual preference is of under age nubile girls.

The  Director is  played by William H. Macy, who is completely unflappable no matter what. The producer arrives after the crew has settled in. The role  is played by droopy-eyed  David Paymer, who is  completely obsessed with money and will bribe anyone to get things moving. The  male star lead is almost fatally distracted by a young teenager (Julia Stiles).  The female lead  and siren, Sarah Jessica Parker,  demands substantial extra money for  appearing naked  in  a scene claiming that she has found religion. Hoffman is smitten  in the heart  by an attractive  young woman  (Rebecca Pidgeon) in the town who is engaged or semi-engaged to the local bad man and town councillor.

I will leave it to the reader's imagination to find out if the  film crew gets the  second chance to screw up again. The movie  is directed by David Mamet, a leading American playwright. Mamet wrote the screen plays for  ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", ""The Untouchables"" , and had a minor role as a performer  in the  1986 thriller  ""Black Widow"". He has directed several movies aside from this one in the past 17 years.

It is evident that Mamet , who also wrote the screen play for this  charming melodrama, was at a loss for a suitable  title for the film, just like the director in the play, who wanted to call his movie ""The Old Mill"", only to find out, upon arrival in the Vermont town, that the  much advertised ""Old Mill"" had burnt down in 1960. So Mamet settled on the uninspiring title ""State and Main"""" from the intersection  where the  town's brand new traffic lights  still stand at the start of the movie. Interestingly enough the title for the DVD version of ""State and Main"" circulating in Greece is translated as  ""Without Title"". I am fairly confident that this little known  102 minute movie will become a  movie buff's classic one day.",1111449600,2,3922,4.664222873900293
1422761,4,B00005BCK9,"Phillip Hoffman is searching for purity.  Unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild Hollywood movie crew, and they are off and shooting in Waterford, Vermont because Main Street is already there.  It is cheaper than building a set.  Then the town folks, New Englanders, dry and pragmatic, mingle with Hollywood slime balls, daft, smooth-talking director, William H. Macy and screen idol, young girl chasing, Alex Baldwin. Sarah J. Parker of Sex in the City fame plays the nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight.  Small town smart girl Rebecca Pigeon and writer Hoffman make the necessary changes in the script and then they fall in love. A scandal threatens the shoot and somebody forgets the mayor's dinner party.  There is plenty of manic fun here.  I recommend for a good laugh. Also, is it just me or is William H.

1422762,5,B00005BCK9,"""State and Main"" is a David Mamet movie, and it shows. While more light-hearted than most of the his other works, it shares their stylized writing, understated cinematography, and brilliantly cynical humor. The movie follows the misadventures of a Hollywood film crew as they try to make a movie in small-town America, spinning locals and movie people alike into a whirlwind of hilarity.
Featuring an ensemble cast of excellent actors (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Rebecca Pidgeon, David Paymer, William H. Macy, Sarah Jessica Parker, Alec Baldwin, Clark Gregg, and Julia Stiles, among others), ""State and Main"" relies on their energy and fast-paced paced interaction to keep the laughs coming. The characters they play are caricatures (the noble writer, the slick director, the skirt-chasing actor, the greedy producer), but they are nevertheless believable. The very absurdity of the characters is entertaining, but the humor is intelligent - there's nothing slapstick about this.
In fact, if the movie has a weakness, it is this very intelligence; at times, the writing seems a little self-conscious, the smartness a little stilted. Nevertheless, I'd much prefer a comedy to be too smart than not smart enough, and ""State and Main"" leans that way if it leans at all.
Aided by a punchy soundtrack, the film gets off to a quick start and maintains its pace throughout. The dialog has a staccato rhythm, and the lines are delivered with beautiful comedic timing. The underlying themes of second chances and the transience of the American Dream are clear, but unobtrusive.
I truly feel that this movie is an underrated masterwork, and I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who likes to laugh. I've watched ""State and Main"" at least five times, and it remains funny and engaging on each viewing - something I find very rare in a film.

1422775,3,B00005BCK9,"This was an interesting movie.  I saw it after reading a part in the New Psycho-Cybernetics mentioned it.  It seemed to be playing with the idea of truth.  One scene had a lawyer guy asking another guy to rehearse a lie out loud just to make sure he could say it.  The dialogue didn't feel real to me, but like they were forced to say things in a certain way.  There was one part where Alec Baldwin's character is signing a baseball and says something like, 'Baseball... that's America's favorite past time'.  It's like some people are walking around stating obvious things and others are lying.  If you held up a piece of paper and said,  ""This is a piece of paper,""  you would fit into this movie nicely.
Near the end, the main character was asking ""What is truth?""  It reminded me of Pontious Pilate asking Christ the same thing.  There was one scene where a person is wearing a jacket that says ""Assembly of Death""  Maybe that was to symbolize the lying nature of the film crew people. I dunno. The ending where he gets a second chance reminded me a little of Abraham bringing his son to the altar to sacrifice him, but is stopped by God at the last second.  And then there's the newspaper that says on it not to bear false witness.

So I decided to rent this movie to see what the whole ""awe"" was about.
The Amazon description pretty much tells you what ""State and Main"" is about so I won't repeat it. The movie was quick, the dialogue between the characters witty and smart. The acting was definitely some of the best that I have seen in a long time. Alec Baldwin is so endearing as the ""big-Hollywood"" actor with a thing for young women (I'm talking teens), William H. Macy perfect as the director trying to keep the actors happy and the crew focused <--- which was very funny in itself to watch :)
Philip Seymour Hoffman always plays such interesting characters he does not disappoint in this one either, he is somewhat a idealistic writer who falls for the local bookstore owner (played by Rebecca Pidgeon) the interaction between these two was again smart, quick, witty lines... David Paymer was (in my personal opinion) the one that stole the movie he was a Hard A$$ producer he didn't take nothing from nobody str8 in your face and what a wonderful change to see this actor play such a part he is usually so secondary that I was pleasantly surprised.
I must make honorable mention to Julia Stiles, Sarah Jessica Parker and Charles Durney whom all did a great job. This was just a very good movie all together the town folks, the town (perfect setting), the film crew (in the movie) great secondary characters. I wouldn't say that I had a lot of LOL moments but it did keep me engaged.
I liked ""Get Shorty"" and ""The Birdcage"" I would put this movie in those categories for Smart Comedy with a very well written script and look at Hollywood coming into a small town and taking over.

When the cast and crew of a Hollywood film are run out of one small town for the ""fetish"" of the lead actor (Baldwin) they must quickly relocate to yet another SmallTown USA.
They are assailed almost immediately by the townfolk, who want a part in the film. The director has his hands full meeting and greeting people, trying to get the movie made on time (and within the budget). The actors are struggling with their own moral dilemas (Baldwin is flirting with disaster in the form of an adoring fan who's just a tad underage and Sarah Jessica Parker doesn't want to show off her breasts in a contractual nude scene because she's found religion). And the poor writer, whose art is being torn apart by actors, producers, and necessity of sets, is just looking for a typewriter to complete the rewrites they're demanding of him.
His quest leads him to a local bookstore, where he finds not only the typewriter, but love, as the woman working the counter turns out to be as intellegent and well read as she is beautiful.
Crisis after crisis ensues, with everything happening around the intersection of State and Main.
When Baldwin is caught with his underage fan, all seems doomed, as the writer is confronted with the moral dilema of having to testify against the star and cancelling the production (and blacklisting himself in Hollywood forevermore) or lying, and losing the affections of the woman he loves.

But it's the film's clever humor that wins out in the end. Never becoming too ""in your face"" with its jokes, State and Main uses a certain kind of nonchalance to present humor. While the characters might realize their situation is absurd or humorous one moment, they in effect shrug their shoulders and continue their frantic pace of making a movie and going on with life. And it is quite amusing to watch as some of the local customs and sayings of this small town begin to filter through the film crew.

It can be sorta crude and annoying as well. But that's what these characters need to be. There is not one likeable character in this movie. That's a nice change of pace. Some of the dialogue and jokes are so different that it might be hard for some people to really get into. It's a thinking comedy. It's not really a laugh out loud type of film. Anyways, the storyline has a film crew, headed by temperamental director William H. Macy, setting up shop in a very Norman Rockwell-ish town to make a movie. And,
needless to say, the cultures between hollywood filmmakers and small town people, clash. Clash horribly. The wonderful supporting cast includes : Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Julia Stiles, Charles Durning, Patti LuPone, and Rebecca Pidgeon(Mamet's wife). This is a good movie that is just not easily enjoyable. Does that make any sense?. Oh well. State And Main is a nice effort.",1003536000,4,1095,4.738219895287958

1422816,1,B00005BCK9,"How does it happen that a cast as terrific as this can be poured into a script as worthless and empty as State and Main? I do not have the space here to convey the awfulness of the pseudo-enigmatic dialogue; the feebleness of the one-liners; the pretension of the attempts at cleverness; the in-your-face vulgarity that subtitutes for satire; the palpable uncomfortableness of talented actors in roles that they barely know what to do with, spouting lines that they simply can't make sound natural. William H. Macy does his best with the ludicrous, mannered dialogue he is lumbered with, but there is no escaping the cage of pretension Mamet has him penned within.
In an attempt to create a funny movie, Mamet seems to have adopted the policy of throwing enough mud at the wall in the hope that some will stick. Almost all of his one-liners fail utterly, and there are whole passages of dialogue that make no sense at all. The characters that you just know you are meant to find engagingly eccentric are just plain annoying after a matter of minutes. A washed-out, watery, unoriginal 'satire' with no style, no class and no invention, every nut and bolt of which has all been done before.",1003104000,10,1188,4.716346153846154
1422817,2,B00005BCK9,"**1/2  David Mamet's &#8220;State and Main&#8221; is what &#8220;Our Town&#8221; might have been had it been conceived by a clear-eyed, modern day cynic.  In this tale, a Hollywood film crew invades the idyllic hamlet of Waterford, Vermont, determined to capture on celluloid the simple bucolic virtues of a bygone era.  The only problem is that those involved with the making of this film-within-a-film lack the requisite innocence themselves to do justice to the theme they purport to be exploring.  They are all typical products of the crass Hollywood culture &#8211; boorish, self-obsessed and thoroughly amoral.  All except the writer of the piece that is, Joseph Turner White (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the one character who is not only in touch with his cravings for a return to innocence, but who passes the moral test laid out for him along those lines at the end.
&#8220;State and Main&#8221; is a clever film, a cute film, a likable film &#8211; it just isn't a very FUNNY film.  The Mamet specialty &#8211; flat, monotone, emotionless line readings &#8211; becomes grating and irritating after awhile.  Both the small town rubes and the big city elitists come across as little more than tired stereotypes who really don't have anything particularly funny to say.  As a result, most of the attempts at humor simply fall flat.  We've seen these characters and situations countless times before &#8211; the temperamental star making exorbitant financial demands, the lecherous leading man endangering the production with his reckless sexual dalliances, the harried producers and directors fighting a constant transcontinental phone battle with demanding studio heads &#8220;back on the coast.&#8221;  And it just isn't all that interesting.  Part of the problem, I think, is that Mamet never really exploits or explores the setting he's chosen.  Most of the townsfolk emerge as minor, background characters at best, with the possible exception of Rebecca Pidgeon as Annie, Joe's eventual love interest.  Pidgeon, who looks uncannily like Marlo Thomas in her &#8220;That Girl&#8221; days, seems sweet as all get out, but the atonal delivery of most of her lines hampers the interest we might otherwise find in her character.

Actually, none of these characters are very interesting &#8211; or very funny.  In fact, most of them seem rather [boring] when you get right down to it, and Mamet fails to provide the satirical wit and bite that would mitigate some of their unpleasantness.  He doesn't generate the kind of out-and-out, hearty laughter that Christopher Guest derived from his examinations of rural America in movies like &#8220;Waiting For Guffman&#8221; and &#8220;Best of Show.&#8221;  Mamet's take is, in many ways, so cynical that he seems to have forgotten to engender the kind of affection for his people that helps keep condescension at bay.  Or, perhaps, it is really so much simpler than that &#8211; maybe he merely neglected to write any truly funny material.",1001808000,,2998,5.2364016736401675
1422818,3,B00005BCK9,"While I admire many of David Mamet's plays, I've yet to be convinced that he knows more than my 4-year-old nephew about how to direct films.  Film buffs and theatre folk tend to revere his work, and I am a bit of both, but you only have to watch them with normal people to see how robotic and cold his films can be - ""Homicide"", ""House of Games"", ""Oleanna"", all are spoiled by the strangely disassociated behaviour of his actors, and his version of Terence Rattigan's ""The Winslow Boy"", while competent, wasn't a patch on a BBC TV version starring Jeremy Brett and Emma Thompson.
All the more surprise, then, that this is a cool, funny, relatively relaxed (for him) movie.  Even his wife Rebecca Pidgeon, usually the worst offender in terms of patented Mametian woodenness, loosens up a bit.  Films about film-making tend to be a bit of a busman's holiday, and this is no exception, but there is a generally unbuttoned and charming feel to the whole thing that makes you forgive a lot.
The message, cause despite what Mamet would like to think, there is one, is unsurprisingly unoriginal - small-town folk are More Real than those Hollywood Weirdos.  But it's lovely to see Philip Seymour Hoffman, usually cast as a sweaty, giggling deviant, as the romantic lead.  William H. Macy, an old Mamet crony, is his usual excellent self, and Alec Baldwin does a lovely line in planetarily self-absorbed comedy.  Even Sarah-Jessica Parker, who normally I can't stand, is a scream as the starlet who won't get her kit off for the camera but is perfectly happy to do it for the screenwriter.
The plot is given far too much attention.  With a movie like this, we care more about incidental moments, or at any rate moments that _seem_ to be incidental - and Mamet is such a control freak, he can't stand it if our eyes are distracted from anything but the Development of the Story and the Revelation of Character, etc. etc.  I'll never believe he's a real director.  But he has, at last, delivered a fun film, even if I don't know how he did it.  So fair play to him, as we say in my town.
Three stars, because good as this is, there a lot of other films out there, by people less respected and famous, which are a lot better.  But if you've already seen them, try this.",1001030400,3,2258,4.509803921568627
1422819,5,B00005BCK9,"David Mamet brings his perfect understanding of plot to this charming little comedy about the clash between stereotypical New Englanders and stereotypical high-powered Hollywood. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as the wide-eyed first-time screenwriter steamrollered by Hollywood; William Macy, a genius as always, is also great as the director trying to keep his fractured cast and crew together to actually try and make some art. I think Mamet is one of the best director/screenwriters out there, but I think of him as a grim realist. I was pleasantly surprised to see he can be truly funny as well.

After the initial ""Wow, this is something different!"", however, the movie gets predictable and tedious. And almost irritating. All I can in it's defense is this: the acting is superb. Julia Stiles is a gem, William H. Macy makes this movie, and Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker are very good as the spoiled, immature movie stars.

1422823,4,B00005BCK9,"This warm, homey, satirical comedy is David Mamet's homage to the filmmaking industry.  It's a story about purity - the unforced, unpretentious timeless simplicity of a quiet New England town populated by just plain folks, and the age-old heroic struggle of the artist trying to share his vision with the world.  But it's also a story about second chances, even if it's only the opportunity to make the same mistake twice.  And certainly it's a story about money, too, but enough with generalities...
The ensemble cast features some of Mamet's favorite actors, including the wonderful William Macy as the smooth-talking director who is determined to get his movie made no matter what, and the always-quirky Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the sensitive author who struggles to keep up with the ever-changing demands that reality makes on his screenplay.  Sarah Jessica Parker plays the leading lady brilliantly, showing us a woman with beauty and charm and animal grace who can scarcely speak a complete sentence unless she's reading it from a script....  Alec Baldwin's performance is less notable; he never really seems to take on the character of the film's skirt-chasing star, but seems to be merely playing himself.
The real standout is the terrific performance by Rebecca Pidgeon whose luminous presence really steals the film and makes her character's romance with the writer the main plot focus.  She's a bookseller, and like most of the people in this small, out of the way town, is much smarter than anyone in the production company (or for that matter watching the movie) expects them to be.  Her dialogues with Hoffman are intimate, artful, creative, and ultimately rather unrealistic, but then, this isn't a very realistic film, and if the illusion of real life is important to you, you might give this one a miss.  If you're willing to concede Mamet his artifice, this sweet, charming story should delight the small-town intellectual in everyone.",998006400,11,1955,5.0875

1422838,3,B00005BCK9,"Having seen just about every film Mamet has to offer, one goes into this with fairly high expectations. The three stars might be as much a symptom of that as any flaws the film has. There are plenty of bright spots here - David Paymer shows his evil side (remember him as the ""Hello"" guy in Crazy People?) perfectly, while Hoffman as usual seems to get to the essence of the person he is portraying. Maybe not as convincingly as in Boogie Nights, but close. Rebecca Pidgeon is always well-used in Mamet's films and I am always amazed that he can handle putting her into intimate situations. But I digress.
The biggest problems with Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker are not their performances but the fact that they are not well-developed and stay in a 2-dimensional periphery throughout the film. This is surprising, considering the impact Baldwin made in Glengarry despite such little screen-time. Macy unfortunately is the most inadequately drawn character despite possibly having the most screentime. He resembles a chicken with his head cut off (ala Billy Crystal in his terrible new movie) and never makes himself the sympathetic rogue he could have been.

There's some fine acting by William H. Macy as the harried director and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the timid screenwriter, but their good performances are not enough to raise this bit of fluff above the ordinary. Alex Baldwin plays a small role as an aging film star who lusts for young girls, Sarah Jessica Parker is the whining leading lady, and Julia Styles is an aggressive underage teenager.  However, if it weren't for some clever one-liners and the enjoyment at poking fun at the film industry, I would have fallen asleep. Please bear in mind though that I'm not a fan of comedies unless its roaringly funny, which this is not.

1422840,3,B00005BCK9,"Movies about movie-making is one o my favorite Hollywood categories, because the writers and directors are doing a subject that they are intimately familiar with.  SUNSET BOULEVARD and THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL are two examples that ""ring true.""  On the light side, SINGING IN THE RAIN is a classic example.  Recently, THE PLAYER had delightful moments of great authenticity, especially the beginning where script writers try to peddle their ideas.
I just saw STATE AND MAIN, available as a rental.  It was written and directed by our era's most overrated dramatist, David Mamet.  It's about making a movie in a small town in Vermont.  I think it's Mamet's best script so far (that isn't saying very much) because it's obviously a subject that he has first-hand knowledge about.
I wondered as I saw it what was wrong with this picture, and it finally dawned on me: the casting of William H. Macy as the harried director was a huge mistake.  Macy is a very fine
actor, of course, and he acted his role to the hilt--alternatively bossy, cajoling, violently exasperated, super obsequious.  He swept from one mood to its opposite as called for in the script.  But something was missing: a humorous edge, a commentary-on-the-commentary.  The role really should have had someone who can act on the meta-level as well as on the script level, someone like Michael Caine.  With Caine in the role, STATE AND MAIN would have been a well-known title by now.
The second flaw in the movie, in my opinion, is that Mamet remained too true-to-life.  He had a great idea: a bunch of cynical Hollywood producers and directors and actors invade a small innocent town, only it turns out that some of the ""innocent"" townies are more cynical and rapacious than the Hollywooders.  But Mamet failed to hone this distinction to a fine edge.  Some of the townies are good decent people, which is true to life of course but gets somewhat in the way of comedic values.  Imagine how funny the movie could have turned out if Neil Simon had written the script!  Mamet's idea is a better one than most of Simon's plots, but Mamet doesn't have the comic inventiveness to see it through.
There are some good situations and good laughs in STATE AND MAIN, and if you like this kind of flick, you'll probably find it worth viewing.",995587200,,2293,4.723618090452261
1422841,5,B00005BCK9,"In all too many films, I find myself let down because the writing is so bad.  Some of the very worst are by directors who also want to be writers but who can't really write. When I find out who they are, I thereafter avoid their films. I never trouble myself with thoughts like these in seeing a David Mamet film though since he is first and foremost a writer.  As usual, he brings his superb screenwriting skills to this vehicle, which he also directed, and turns it into pure gold.  He places William H. Macy front and center as a film director who is trying to bring a film in on budget in New England although disaster looms on every front.  I frankly never thought Macy could be a funny, ha-ha kind of actor but he is absolutely hilarious as this director with a bunker mentality. I also never thought Philip Seymour Hoffman could play a romantic lead but in this film he does so admirably with Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon.  Hoffman is the writer on the film and Pidgeon becomes his muse and support system in one as she takes over his heart.

Alec Baldwin plays himself as an obnoxious movie star and is also perfect doing so. He brings the chief conflict into the film, the prospect of the film's being shut down because of his penchant for bedding underage girls.  Perhaps the most brilliant casting of all though is David Paymer, as producer Marty, who is perfect in every scene as the Machievellian man who will do anything to reach his end goal, bringing the film in. This film reminds me of Preston Sturges' ""Travels of Sullivan,"" a masterpiece of screwball comedy.  Mamet is not really known for comedy but rather for incisive drama.  You'd never know that, however, from seeing this film.  You'd think he'd been doing comedy all of his life.  The only other comic film of his that I can recall is ""Things Change,"" also a superb film.  All of Mamet's work is a must-see for me and I am rarely disappointed with the results.

David Paymer is his near-equal as the film's producer, who can go from charming to threatening and back again in the flex of a facial muscle and the click of a cell-phone key. Philip Seymour Harris as the film's writer is goofy but strangely likeable, and has a nice counterpart in Rebecca Pidgeon as the town's bookstore owner and head of the local drama club. Alec Baldwin is, as usual, better than his material and seems to have found a new career as a character actor by sending up his former glamorous leading man persona, this time playing the film's star actor who has a thing for young (read: TOO YOUNG) girls. Sarah Jessica Parker does a decent as his leading lady, a bimbo hired for her body who thinks that ""The Old Mill"" will give her the chance to do more. The supporting cast is filled with charming performances, clever visuals fill the screen, and snappy dialogue keeps the pace moving reasonably well until about 30 minutes from the end.

The problem is that the old mill burned down in 1960, part of a spate of ""unexplained fires"".  And that's just one of the funny set pieces of David Mamet's latest movie.
There is the overly tense, carbohydrate-hating director, played to perfection by William H. Macy.  The male star, played with swagger by Alec Baldwin.  The female star, who refuses to go topless (despite having committed to it in her contract) unless the production company pays her additional money, played by Sarah Jessica Parker.  And the hapless writer, who now must find a substitute for the mill, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
Unlike most Mamet-written or -directed films, this is a gentle comedy, without most of the raw language of his plays.  But the dialogue is no less sharp and no less funny.  There isn't a weak link in the cast, and the laughs keep coming as Bob (Baldwin) gets into trouble with yet another teenage girl (Julia Stiles, who makes it unclear whether she is the seducer or the seducee), Joseph (Hoffman) struggles to keep up with the demanded rewrites, and a town prosecutor vindictively (and then justifiably) goes after the film company for what is happening to the town.

Rebecca Pidgeon stars in all three of these Mamet films, and once again she has been perfectly cast as a clever, witty, emancipated and articulate young woman. In STATE AND MAIN she plays the local drama teacher who directs the community theater. When asked about children she says, ""I never saw the point of them."" Pidgeon is a perfect foil to the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman who has also acted in several other really good films including NEXT STOP WONDERLAND. I had not seen Mr. Hoffman play a ""leading man"" before and I think he did a very fine job.
The cast is multitalented and with this much talent it's easy to make a turkey as ""stars"" twinkle and fall all over each other. However, Mr. Mamet apparently runs a tight ship. The actors interact perfectly. Their timing is terrific. Their lines are clever and succinct. They are mostly likeable although they all have character defects.  All of us could probably say ""this crew reminds me of the people at my work place."" These are ordinary people with ordinary motives--except this is show business.
The device of the play within the play is used, as well as  other elements from the great playwright Shakespeare. Hoffman plays a playwright who has been asked to adopt his stage play ""The Old Mill"" into a screen play set in a town without an old mill. Thus, he must rewrite his script. One wonders how much of himself Mamet put into the characters played by Hoffman and Pidgeon. Although other characters' motives are made reasonably clear, this story is told from the perspective of the writer.

1422856,2,B00005BCK9,"David Mamet has been involved creatively in some exquisite films: Spanish Prisoner, House of Games, Homicide, Glengarry Glen Ross and -- while not really a film -- American Buffalo. He has also made one of the worst films of all times: Oleanna. What made Oleanna so terrible were hackneyed, forced, and obvious plot devices; the most obvious targets for derision hit in the most egregiously obvious ways; and inane dialogue. State and Main joins the inauspicious company, though it avoids being a complete object of ridicule because the dialogue is not inane. The dialogue and acting are consistently good throughout. What makes this film so risible is that everything that happens in it is either obvious or dumb -- often both. A key plot point involves the inadvertent erasing of a dinner date on a blackboard leading to much forced mayhem (Did Mamet learn this device in his high school creative writing class? Or did he just pick it up naturally watching ""Three's Company""?). The story is resolved with -- literally, I am not making this up -- a ""big bag of money"". There is a visit by a prospective lover when not five minutes before -- again, I am not making this up -- an unwanted and uninvited seductress has shown up in the bedroom to make for the most awkward of situations (oh! you can hear the laughter already, it's so darn clever -- where could she be hiding her naked body? under the bed? in the bathroom? NO! Don't open the closet door!). The key dilemma for the film's key character - the writer, The Innocent - between ""purity"" and ""success and temptation"" is resolved by...wait for it...a choice that enables him to have BOTH. Yippee. I am so relieved. Thank God Mamet didn't opt for the easy way out. The Innocent gets to make the moral choice, but nonetheless gets all the money and the fame anyway. And the forced contrast between the fast-talking Hollywood types and the slow-talking innocent yokels of the small town ends up revealing absolutely nothing of substance.
Satire is tough to pull off. If the target is too obvious and/or if your critique of the target is too obvious, well then, you don't have satire. You have nothing but a painful experience. You have nothing but random barroom conventional wisdom and insults -- politicians are all liars, sports celebrities are spoiled prima donnas, Hollywood actors are shallow, corporate executives are greedy. Well, yes. And then? It is a really disappointing film.

Or as one character puts it ""showbiz hell.""  It's all here: contractually obligated starlets forced to pose nude because of script obligations; the obsessed screenwriter; the oversexed male lead with an eye for pretty tennaged girls; the frazzled director forced to suck up to everyone just to have the movie made; the starstuck locals angling for a 10-second cameo; and all those endless rewrites that pop up just minutes  before the camera rolls.

""State and Main"" allowed me to relax while I watched it. There were no gimmicks, no tricks--just a humorous story, simply told. The casting was good and there was a wide variety of characters populating a somewhat typical New England town. There were no real caricatures, although many of the Hollywood people were as shallow and smug and conniving as I always imagined them to be, many with huge egos.
The movie keeps the viewer on his/her tos with cleverly written dialogue and fast scene changes. All in all, an enjoyable film.",993427200,4,764,4.503597122302159

1422861,4,B00005BCK9,"""State and Main"" is the latest movie to attack the whole Hollywood movie making system.  Like Blake Edwards's ""S.O.B."" and Robert Altman's ""The Player,"" David Mamet's movie could only have been made by a thoroughly disgusted insider.  There are striking similarities in all three movies.  Each was made by a director with a strong independent streak, each feature large ensemble casts of well known actors and actresses doing parodies of themselves and each is a cynical black comedy about the making of a Hollywood movie.  That said, Mamet's film is well acted, particularly by the always great William H. Macy as the slick Director and by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the playwrite turned screenwriter.  Alec Baldwin is appropriately sleazy as the leading man with a penchant for teenage girls and Sarah Jessica Parker has some amusing moments as the leading lady who suddnly develops a phobia about shooting a nude scene.  The Vermont town on which this Hollywood horde descends is filled with the type of unusal eccentrics one would expect in a small New England villiage.
The film's plot has two central stories, one is the attempt to cover up the illicit liasion between Bladwin's character and a local teenager.  The other is a rather sweet love story between Hoffman and a local used bookseller, played by Rebecca Pidgeon, who's engagingly spunky performance almost steals the show from her better known co-stars.  Through all of this, the film manages to be at times whimsical and at times quite funny.  Unfortunately, its huge cast turns out to be a bit of a liability and as a result a number of the characters underdeveloped and cliche.  A number of plot treads, such as the destruction of the town's cherished stained glass fire house window, are left hanging.  And the movie's ending, aiming for the same type of cynical tour-de-force as the climax of ""The Player,"" ultimately falls short from lack of plausibility.
Overall, ""State and Main"" is an enjoyable film for movie buffs and will not disappoint fans of Mamet's quirky style.  But as a send-up of Hollywood, it shoots a bit wide of the mark.",993254400,,2110,4.912676056338028
1422862,4,B00005BCK9,"The marketing of ""State and Main"" did it little justice.  I stayed away at first, fearful of another tired send-up of Hollywood and it's surreal machinations.  Also, it appeared to be a wacky, zany, nutty comedy (three adjectives that should never -- NEVER! -- precede the word comedy).  Thankfully, it's only a little of the former and relatively none of the latter.
What is it really?  A David Mamet film.  Silly me for thinking otherwise.  Once again, Mamet's script huffs and puffs, trying desperately to blow down the pomposity of the filmmakers who land on a small Vermont town.  And it tries its best to inflate the small town folk, imbuing them with homespun knowledge, wisdom, and most importantly, purity.  And when it realizes that it can't do either -- that both manage to be the proverbial immovable object to its unstoppable force -- it settles down into a finely crafted character study.
Standouts in this respect include William H. Macy's cynical director, spouting platitudes into the ears of whomever needs calming, and ripping into his crew with deadpan glee.  David Paymer is biting as the producer who has all the answers and damns anyone who gets in his way.  Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker play the lead actors in the film-within-the-film.  He has a perilous predilection for young girls.  She's found religion.  The film never tells you which is worse.  And Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the movie crew's token innocent (he's the writer, natch), finally gets to play a character who's both likable and *not* creepy.  He even manages a series of near-miss love scenes.
And whom does Mr. Hoffman share his love scenes with.  Why, it's Rebecca Pidgeon, of course.  I quote from my review of Mamet's ""The Spanish Prisoner"", regarding her performance:  ""[She's] Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Well, not really.""  True, she redeemed herself by the end of that movie, but not nearly enough to get another kick at the can in one of her husband's films.  And yet here she is again.  And you know what?  She's astounding!  Her bookish theatre director is (under-) played with just the right amount of simple wisdom and joyous wit.  Whereas in ""The Spanish Prisoner"" I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Campbell Scott's character didn't haul off and push her into the sea, here I was rooting for Hoffman's character to wake up and see what a great woman he had right in front of his eyes.  Bravo!
""State and Main"" is not a traditional Mamet theatre/film piece, filled with non-sequiturs like ""dog my cats"" and prone to making grand and stately visions about the morality of man.  It most definitely is about the search for purity.  And it's set in a place where the truth, if heard by even the most cynical of ears, would make a lot of sense.",991699200,36,2768,4.770526315789474
1422863,3,B00005BCK9,"People might think that there is nothing more than this film than a movie crew invading the quiet little town of Waterford, Vermont.  Suprisingly, it does.  Mamet leaves the suspense of his last movie, The Spanish Prisoner, and ops for a more comedic script.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman and William H. Macy head this all-star cast.  Hoffman plays a somewhat confused writer of a movie called ""The Old Mill"".  Macy is the director, now a little angered that they once again have to move to another sleepy little town because of their lead actor played by William Baldwin.  Amongst the romance and the brilliant dialouge that seem to just never stop is the quest for purity.  Take a glance at this film, there's more to it than you'd think.",988329600,3,735,4.6953125
1422864,3,B00005BCK9,"This is a disappointing film from Mamet.  The film has a cynical ending, but the cynicism is not deep and biting enough to be satisfying.  It also has a romantic ending, but the romance is too cold to evoke warmth.  Part of why the romance does not work is Rebecca Pidgeon.  As in The Winslow Boy, she comes across as distant, condescending, and ironic.  She would be good in the right type of roles, but she is far too cold and insincere as the small-town woman who opens the playwright's heart to love and makes him understand virtue.  As for Philip Seymour Hoffman, he was great in The Talented Mr. Ripley, but here he mostly walks about looking as if he has indigestion or constipation.
The premise of the film is promising: a self-absorbed Hollywood film crew invades a charming, old-fashioned small town in Vermont.  The comic possibilities are endless.  Take the plans for the film honchos to have dinner with the mayor (played by Charles Durning, who practically sleepwalks through this bit role) and his small-town socialite wife.  This has great comic potential.  So what does Mamet do?  He has the film crew forget to show up!  Again and again Mamet pulls so little comedy from a plot with so much potential.
I like William H. Macy, but he is miscast.  He doesn't summon enough alternating menace and charm in his role as the Hollywood director.  He would have been better cast as one of the Vermont yokels (just as he was brilliantly cast as a Fargo car salesman in Fargo and as a small-town conformist in Pleasantville).
There is a film within the film that is supposed to reflect the themes of State and Main.  Yet Mamet scarcely explains what the film within the film is, so we're left guessing as to how everything relates.  What's more, the screenwriter is supposed to be a brilliant playwright (David Mamet, anyone?), but the little dialogue we hear and scenes that we see of the film within the film are terrible (State and Main, anyone?)
Mamet is coasting.  He recycles the idea from his Spanish Prisoner of someone who is fooled by a stage set.  Mamet does not show us the creative process as the screenwriter reworks the script on the set.  Instead, we see him acting depressed until a figurative light bulb goes off in his head (or in Pidgeon's head when she gets the ideas for him).  What creative discoveries they make are explained only at the most general and abstract level (with dialogue such as ""I know!  This film is about purity and second-chances!"").  This is not an exploration of the creative process - it is the illusion of an exploration.  It is the difference between thinking and merely scrunching up your face as if you were thinking.",980640000,7,2674,4.642553191489362

Yes, the only people who really care about child rape are ambitious, self righteous politicians like the guy in the movie.  For normal, right minded people its just a minor nuisance that can tie up your film production unnecessarily.

Another example of how Hollywood tries to subtly change our view of the most perverse acts imaginable.  Sure the girl was looking for it and didn't seem too young or too innocent.  That's necessary to avoid shocking the audience and letting them in on the real message here.  You don't go for the jugular just yet, not in 2000 when this was filmed.  Just find a borderline case to portray in the movie, excuse it away and you have set people up for the next stage, which now, in 2017, is starting to go full force.  Nope, most viewers will hardly even notice what the producers did here.  Not consciously.  Creepy Hollywood perverts are clever and think long term.

I've worked on a number of location films over the years (doing voiceovers) and as funny as this film is, it's also oh so real! The cast here is amazing: Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP), Bill Macy, Alec Baldwin, and the lovely beautiful Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife) and more.

Mamet is so great at comedy I'm kind of surprised he doesn't make more of them. Sometimes his cryptic dialog is a blessing, sometimes it is a bit distracting, but in this film it works wonderfully. The humor is so tight and so well written that you can watch the film a dozen times and still find new jokes, new lines you missed. A great film.
