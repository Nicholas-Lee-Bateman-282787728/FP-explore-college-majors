8714231,3,B00WTOTYMU,"Released on June 21, 2014, Ribbit is the result of a collaboration between Malaysian Kru Studios and Crest Animation Studios.  Its 88-minutes long and while budget and profit/ loss info has never been made public, it debuted at the Cannes Film Market in 2012, premiered at the Niagara Integrated Film Festival on 21 June 2014 where it won Best Family Film.  It had a theatrical run in Malaysia in September 2014 and was released in the United States directly-to-DVD on November 25 2014.

Ribbit falls into what I consider a very gray area of animated features.  Its a near-hit in every single category that matters yet somehow manages to come up short every step of the way.  Lets start with the good.  The film has some nice visuals.  No not the type weve come to expect from Pixar and DreamWorks but it does make use of a very vibrant color pallet.  Some of the water textures look amazing along the way and the character models all emote well.  This movie was done at Crest Studios, perhaps best known for their work on the Alpha and Omega franchise.  These guys aren't a top tier production house but they certainly have a good handle on the animation game and how to extract the most from the CG medium.

Since this was a film animated around an English script and vocal performance, Ribbit (fortunately) doesnt contend with the issue of trying to dub an English language track atop a foreign film.  If this doesnt seem important to you, please take a moment to skim through some of my past reviews that make use of the practice and the common theme of what disasters the end result becomes.

Another plus is that the film does its very best to build a dynamic between the two lead characters- never mind the oddity that is a poison dart frog and a flying squirrel falling in love, lets just leave it at their character arc develops pretty steadily from the first frame to the final.

Now the bad.  Perhaps the films greatest crime is one of pacing.  The story centers on titular character Ribbit suffering a bit of an identity crisis and becoming convinced, via the persuasion of a hypnotic vampire bats suggestion, that he is in fact a human prince in frog form.  In typical fairy tale fashion, he becomes certain that a kiss from a human princess could lift the spell placed upon him and return him to his natural form.  Of course along the way he discovers, through a series of spoon-fed lessons, that he is special the way he is and that happiness could be found in his own backyard.

While in no danger of winning any cleverness awards, the story is passable enough, especially for a film that claims its target audience should be between ages 5-7.  I can go off on a tangent here and remind all animated movie studios everywhere that part of what has made companies like Pixar and DreamWorks so successful is that while they cater to the youth, its their appeal to the adults who purchase the childrens theater tickets that keep people coming back for more.

In any event, lets talk pacing. The first half of the movie is chock full of exposition that kids will undoubtedly tire of in a hurry.  Ribbit encounters a succession of animals (from oecelots to a bat to a toucan to a manatee/ hippo couple to a caiman etc.) all of whom teach him some lesson of self discovery.  Nothing wrong with this but again, 7-minutes of straight dialog with each simply isn't going to cut it with the youngsters.

One gets the feeling the producers realized this and, rather than make some trims in the name of flowing narrative, they tried to jam as much action as possible into the spaces between all the dialog.  There are near-misses aplenty!  From planes falling out of trees to trips over a seemingly endless succession of waterfalls to escaping sticky spider-webs; the tale of Ribbit can best be summarized in two words: Close & call.

The final nail in the pacing coffin comes in about the final 20-minutes of the film when suddenly a whole new subplot is dropped into the viewers lap involving a tribe of indigenous humans and an assassination attempt a little animal cruelty and so on.  Again, by themselves, none of the elements here are poor.  But sandwiched together the way they are is a bit odd.  The first half of the movie is tedious, laced with exposition and fairly lackluster then suddenly a new story comes in from seemingly out of nowhere that allows for a big climax complete with Hollywood style happy ending.

The vocal cast does a pretty bang up job here with Ribbit being played by a convincingly insecure Sean Astin.  Relative unknown Cherami Leigh does a very nice job with the flying squirrel sidekick Sandy.  Tim Curry and Russell Peters have fairly minuscule parts that could likely have been just as well performed by scratch actors.

As a whole Ribbit certainly doesnt commit any of the glaring faux pas that usually equate to an instant kiss of death for viewer enjoyment but neither, though, does it deliver anything quite well enough to make it memorable or even endearing against an ever-expanding ocean of CG animated feature films.  I suppose that could be enough to give any frog an identity crisis.",1468368000,,5135,4.624035281146638
