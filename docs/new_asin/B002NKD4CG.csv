6240463,1,B002NKD4CG,"I've grown so weary of these froth over substance horror movies and the incongruous cover art that accompanies them. This was absolutely terrible and like many of the others out here gives that illusion of the first year film major galloping along with  a go-pro and creating yet another in a throng of uneventful, uninspiring and outrageously boring dreck.  There is absolutely nothing here that would interest even the most ardent and tolerant horror fan.  However, if you truly look forward to anticipating nothing you will definitely be satiated.",1516492800,6,550,5.157303370786517

6240465,2,B002NKD4CG,"Really hard to make it through this.  ""Home video"" look and sound is distracting. Given a motion picture quality it might have been better.",1516406400,,139,4.791666666666667
6240466,1,B002NKD4CG,"The cover looks thrilling and appealing, but the movie totally sucked.",1516320000,,70,5.454545454545454
6240467,4,B002NKD4CG,"If you like classic Horror, this is a film you will enjoy. Set in the United Kingdom this black & white ""film noir"" reminds me of some of the old classic horror films you'd see back in the 1930s or 40s, or even some of the best Horror television shows like ""Creature Feature"" or ""Thriller Chiller"" which were popular in the 1970s. The Director Steven Smith pays a true 1930s style Horror Homage, but set his film in a modern day world with some really creepy, scary characters. Don't want to post any spoilers, but there are a few spots in the film you'll squirm in your seat or clutch your date if you're watching the film with your partner.",1514937600,3,642,4.358333333333333
6240468,5,B002NKD4CG,"This Fabulous Flik has a Gothic Feel to it, with Eerie Organ Music, a Mad Scientist, & Filmed in Black & White, with some occasional Splashes of Red Blood ! There's also a Haunted House & a Tribute to Dr. Moreau & his Menagerie of Human? Experiments wonderfully served up by Writer/Director STEVEN M. SMITH !
This Violent Extravaganza of Gore begins with three young adults searching for the Rathbone Secret to Present on Social Media & gain millions of Followers & possibly pounds ! Lovely MARIA AUSTIN frumps herself down & appears as the Nerdlike BookWorm ""Sophia"" . ERIK KNUTSVIK is the Self-Indulgent ""Jason"" ; & the Incredibly Beautiful Ginger TIFFANY-ELLEN ROBINSON Nails the Role of the Sexy & Sex-Hungry Bitchy Diva ""Kirsty"" !
The Odd-Ball Mad Scientist Role is portrayed excellently by JON-PAUL GATES as ""Rathbone"" , with his ""Bride"" ELIZABETH SAINT Showcasing her natural Beauty & her added Deformities for an effective presentation . British Horror Icon TONY FADIL is Perfect as ""The Beast"" with a possible Heart & a definite Taste for Beauty ! Other Oddities are SARAH ROSE DENTON as ""The Slut"" , MARIAM KAXUXWENA as ""Rathbone's Assistant"" , VANESSA HIDER as ""The Bimbo"" , WENDY MORGAN as the ""Pig Creature"" , JEREMY HILL as ""The Creature"" , & STEVEN M. SMITH himself as ""The Crawling Creature"" ! Then there's HANS HERNKE as ""Shelley"" !
The Make-Up & Special Effects are Amazing , as well as Everyone's Performance ! It Appears that Mr. Smith kept a Tight Rein on things ; but I suspect that Everyone had a Great Time in Production !
I'm anxiously awaiting a DVD release because Prime may take the film down at any time ; & I'll be visiting ""The Howling"". many more times !

A Note to my Fellow Americans who have a Hard Time understanding the Accents :............ Put the Phone Down & Pay Attention ; They're Speaking Proper English !",1514764800,3,1849,4.724458204334366
6240469,5,B002NKD4CG,"""The Howling"" is a fun film that is a throwback and homage to the classic monster flicks! Another great film and interesting story with plot twists from Steven M. Smith and Greenway Entertainment!",1514678400,,196,4.96969696969697

6240471,5,B002NKD4CG,"Modern Classic 1930s style Horror Homage - If you can get past the first 20 mins when the teens actually arrive at Rathbones lab building, it becomes a much better film. They have created a real sense of 1930s horror films like Frankenstein and The Mummy on a minimal budget. The acting is great throughout and the production design and sets are amazing! A little Gem in the making. Just hope it doesn't get lost in the market place.",1514505600,2,433,4.493670886075949
6240472,4,B002NKD4CG,"I'm not going to comment on the films themselves, just the presentation.

In the US, these two films are currently available in a few different releases, either standalone or featured with another movie. It's safe to assume all the presentations for these two films are identical (the same disc image even), since they're all released by Echo Bridge Entertainment. When I look up the DVD info in Windows Media Player (it scans the disc and looks for it in an online database), it even shows the box art for the standalone releases. Amazon lists this one as by Platinum Disc, but indeed the box features the Echo Bridge label. For the record, it's not two discs like the box states but one double-sided disc. You may as well pick up one of the double feature releases since they're generally not much more expensive than the standalones.

As for the presentation itself, Ghoulies 4 is in fullscreen (which I assume is the OAR since it was straight to video) with good PQ and AQ (certainly better than VHS) and no extras (just scene selection). It's hard to expect much for a movie like this, especially given the low cost of the DVD (about $5). I haven't seen any other release (like the Region 2), so I don't know how it compares (I'd be interested to know). I haven't watched Howling 4 yet but it's also in fullscreen with no extras.",1358208000,4,1334,4.577405857740586

8636941,4,B002NKD4CG,"Reminded me of the old black and white Vincent Price, Frankenstein, horror films.  Made me gasp, jump, cringe, and look away at the gory points - all things youd want and expect from a horror film.",1521676800,,197,4.472222222222222
8636942,1,B002NKD4CG,I see what they were trying to do but didn't work. Acting was good however the story was bad. Camera work and editing was very novice. There were very few stand out shots but didn't help. The movie jumped around and made no sense. The only thing positive I can say is you can see the filmmakers passion/vision but has a lot to learn in making a horror.,1521417600,,352,4.1911764705882355
8636943,1,B002NKD4CG,stop putting cheap movies on and add something good,1520380800,,51,4.777777777777778
8636944,4,B002NKD4CG,"Despite all the bad reviews on here I actually kinda like this movie.  It has a cool throwback feel of the old black & white movies I watched when I was a kid.  I enjoy off-the-beaten-path horror stuff like this. Give it a try, but don't expect any CGI special effects.  This is a low budget film, after all - but I did find myself drawn in to the creepiness of some of the scenes and felt the need to look over my shoulder to make sure nobody was behind me on more than one occasion.
  Look, this is just my 2 cents.  Is it the best movie ever - no.  It's going to cater to a certain type of person and that may or may not be you.  If you've grown weary of the cheap-shot BS ""scares"" from Hollywood that involve pumping the volume up and jolting you with noise when someone turns around quickly then you might give this one a try.",1519689600,,831,4.024390243902439
