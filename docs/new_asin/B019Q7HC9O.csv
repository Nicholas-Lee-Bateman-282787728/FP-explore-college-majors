Since then I have ordered 3 region free blu ray DVD players, this movie still will not work.  Returning movie",1498521600,,288,4.181818181818182
8745789,3,B019Q7HC9O,"Quo Vado? or Where Am I Going? as it is titled on region 4 DVDs where it comes with English subtitles is an Italian/Norwegian filmed movie with both of those languages spoken, but mostly Italian since the main character is an Italian public servant.  On the region 4 which you'd imagine would be the same subtitled film used on UK or US released DVD versions down the track, the Norwegian language isn't always subtitled which is disappointing, as there's a time when the main character is living in Bergen and speaks to his father so that he can't understand in Norwegian with his Norwegian tutor sitting opposite, which both start laughing at while his father who doesn't speak Norwegian has no idea what insults he's being put down with. Due to the lack of subtitles, neither do we the viewer. Perhaps a different person wrote the subtitles to the Italian spoken parts to the Norwegian ones and this was just missed as it wasn't a Norwegian character talking. But you'd think someone would proof watch the DVD before it goes into production.

The film itself is okay but nothing special that justifies the fact that this is the highest grossing film in Italian box office history.  The back of the DVD tells us this, as well as the fact it took nearly the equivalent of sales for the first three weeks of The Force Awakens, in just it's first weekend.  It's not a politically correct film, has a fair bit of crude humour, at times the main character makes racist comments and reminded me of Borat, but overall I didn't quite think the film achieved the laughs with cultural clashes and so forth that Borat did. Although Borat was morally questionable, you still kind of liked him.  If you don't think you could watch a movie with a scene where a white boy and an African boy are fighting and the main character breaks it up saying no one is better than the other, ""you might be white, but you are smaller, and you, although you are taller and older, you are also darker"" to the other one, then this probably isn't the film for you. I really didn't find the main character to be that likable, as really his main goal is to manipulate the system to keep a cushy job where he does very little but gets paid a lot by the Italian tax payer in a country trying to avoid bankrupty and in severe debt to other countries and global companies, who themselves need to be repaid to avoid the same situation themselves.

That's the premise of the film, Checco is a middle aged slacker, whose dad arranged for him to get a cushy job in the public service when he was younger.  The film jokingly portrays anyone lucky enough to have a public service job as akin to a rock star, women will date you in the hopes of marrying you and things like this. It also of course plays up the negative stereotype that most countries not just Italian public servants have, of sitting or standing around all day doing very little, and getting bribes, free food and other perks.  So when Italy's creditors tell Italy it needs to cut the financial waste and start operating efficiently, public servants who thought they'd have a job for life start to get laid off.  Those who don't have kids, aren't married, disabled, care for someone with a disability and other criteria Checco doesn't meet, are being offered a redundancy package or transferred somewhere they don't want to go, to do something that is no longer the easy work life they've had so far.  But Checco isn't prepared to give up his cushy job and is prepared to temporarily go wherever they send him, such as Africa or the North Pole (although why an Italian public servant would be based in these places who knows). While his father gives him advice like take a sickie, go see the psychiatrist and get them to say you can't cope with this new environment and other scams that are sort of the urban legends of most workplaces.  But an attractive Norwegian co-worker may change his stance and behaviour, which won't please his father.

Having spent time in both Norway and Italy, the stereotypes are of course exaggerated but there is some truth in the differences between the two cultures. Such as Checco when in Bergen asks ""how  long do Norwegians wait to honk their horns?"" when the car in front doesn't start driving when the light turns green, after he honked straight away and was chastised. When he is told, ""we don't honk the driver will go eventually,"" he is shocked.  I think if you're not familiar with either culture you might not get much out of this film at all.",1494201600,,4510,4.551851851851852
8745790,1,B019Q7HC9O,"If you are thinking this movie will play in the US, DO NOT BUY IT!  It is not compatible with a US Blue Ray player, and will not work.",1493856000,,134,3.6206896551724137
8745791,5,B019Q7HC9O,"Don't think the other reviews give the movie justice, as their complaints are regarding the disc/technology.

Otherwise, this movie is hilarious! Even more so if you're familiar or ever dealt with anyone in the Italian Govt, or familiar with Italian customs/culture. Great movie and must watch.",1491696000,,294,5.391304347826087
