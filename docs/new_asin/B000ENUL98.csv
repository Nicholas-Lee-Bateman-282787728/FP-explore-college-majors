2524414,2,B000ENUL98,"My oh my, how long has it been since my wife and I enjoyed his performances in the 1950's.  Great performance and brought back many good and bad memories.  Quality was not as good as one might wish for but enjoying it still.",1291334400,,224,4.186046511627907
2524415,1,B000ENUL98,"Sad to say, Brother Dave was at the end of his life when he did this show and his heart was obviously not in it.
Remember him best through the brilliant first two albums and let this pass by.",1232496000,,191,3.923076923076923
2524416,5,B000ENUL98,"Brother Dave was a contemporary of Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl, equally innovative and controversial.  He was the first comic who specialized in Southern humor, and set the pattern for many to follow.  Unfortunately, he never got the same kind of exposure, especially outside the South, so he's in danger of being forgotten.  That would be a serious cultural loss.

This 90-minute show, recorded in 1982 less than a year before he passed away, is about as good a compendium of Brother Dave as you can get.  All his most noteworthy routines are there, interspersed with random observations about nearly everything, and a few of his musical bits as well -- he could sing and play the drums, too.  The remastered DVD is high-quality.  My only quibble is that there are only a few index points, so you'll need to figure out where your favorite bits are and fast-forward to them from the nearest index mark -- but that is, as I said, a quibble.  Enjoy!",1231804800,,945,4.650602409638554
2524417,4,B000ENUL98,"This film shows Brother Dave in his twilight, long after his glory days. He still brings the excitement, and you see him basking in the sheer joy of performing. It is really something to see him performing live after only hearing the albums and CDs for the last forty years.",1222732800,,274,4.5
2524418,5,B000ENUL98,I have listen to his humor for many years.  Now I finally see what his act looked like on stage.  I can see there is more humor in watching him as well as listening.  The quality was good.  It didn't have a menu or scene selection which would have been nice.,1221955200,,258,4.0
2524419,5,B000ENUL98,"I heard this guy a lot growing up, but always on audio--vinyl record to be correct (I'm sure you knew that).

Well, if you ever wondered what it was like to see him in person here it is.  What surprised me about this was how well he actually used music in his act.  He sang whole songs between comedy bits and I was surprised to find I was actually kind of moved by his choice of songs and how he presented them.

After watching this the first time I thought--God, what an Industrial Strenth Nightclub Comic.  This guy was really a classic act, somebody who was born to do this.  He's every bit of up there with Joe E. Lewis or any other great nightclub talent you care to name.  He's just great at what he does.

My only lookout to you would be that they didn't really mic the audience up very well so you can't really hear the reactions he got during this performance.  I read on the net where somebody who was there said it was a loud, demonstrative, raucous crowd who loved the whole thing and laughed every time he flicked an ash off of his cigareette.

So, bearing that in mind, you will have to add your own audience sounds.

Well, enough of blah, blah.  Just don't miss this if you're a fan.  You won't regret shelling out a few bucks for this.  This guy was a fantastic talent and is and will be missed for quite some time.

Goodby, beloved.",1210464000,10,1350,4.21875

Not exactly what I expected of Brother Dave. Good nevertheless.",1188172800,,220,12.8125
2524421,4,B000ENUL98,"It was gift for my Father. He saw Brother Dave in person several times years ago. Dad enjoyed the gift, for the old LP's he had were so scratched from wear, one could barely understand them. Brother Dave came along at a time when segregation was still in vogue and political correctness wasn't heard of. His stories might offend some, but there is no cursing and no one is a target of tastless humor.",1178928000,8,400,4.418918918918919
2524422,5,B000ENUL98,"I have admired the hipster meets Southern preacher styled humor of Brother Dave Gardner ever since I was a teenager. As I am only 44 now, that makes me a little ""late"" to the party in regards to Bro. Dave. I discovered his albums by accident as a teen and bought them all. As a college student in 1982, I remember reading in the newspaper that Dave had been ""down and out"" and was poised to make a comeback. One of those ""comeback"" appearances was at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta - and I was in the audience. The show was hilarious! I had always hoped that there would be a recording of the show released, but when Dave died just a year later, it seemed that was not to be.

Luckily for us, Earl Owensby filmed one of Dave's ""comeback"" concerts. Unfortunately, when the movie finally made it to VHS a few years ago, it had been chopped in half and re-edited to make two separate VHS cassettes. Something was lost by doing so, and those videos never seemed to be fully satisfactory.

Now, however, with the release of this DVD, everything seems to be back in its proper order in one continious 93 minute concert. It's a joy to see Brother Dave do his thing - all of the most famous stories are here (like ""The Motorcycle Story"", ""The Haunted House"" etc) along with several Southern-fried songs and new material. There's even Dave playing a ""trap piece"" on his drums.

Perhaps with the release of this DVD, as well as the new touring production ""Rejoice Dear Hearts"", David Wright's new one-man play featuring the life story and humor of Brother Dave, Mr. Gardner will receive the attention he is due as one of the groundbreaking and most popular comedians of the late 50s/early 60s. Maybe someone will even compile a collection of his numerous tv appearances (something like 50 appearances on Jack Paar alone!). Though he died too young at age 57, his humor lives on - see where he was near the end of his short life...and laugh yourself silly with this DVD.",1144800000,52,1955,4.485955056179775
2524431,5,B000ENUL98,"I grew up listening to Brother Dave and was not aware that there was a DVD available, so when I saw it I immediately ordered it.  I have listened to him for close to 50 years and it was great to actually see him perform.  He was just way ahead of his time and that's what made him so good.  Just good southern humor.  great buy and great service",1416700800,,345,3.9565217391304346
2524432,4,B000ENUL98,"If you've ever heard and enjoyed any of Brother Dave's performances, you'll like this DVD, which provides video accompaniment.",1405814400,,126,5.684210526315789
2524433,5,B000ENUL98,It does not get any better than this....  Bro  Dave is a slave to some of the best humor ; and is at the top of the list as a story teller !,1405641600,,140,3.212121212121212
2524434,5,B000ENUL98,"Gift for my husband who has been a Bro. Dave fan for many years.  We owned the VHS, and were glad to find the dvd.",1364601600,,114,3.56
2524435,1,B000ENUL98,Very disappointed in this dvd.  I think Brother Dave must have been well past his prime when this was recorded.  I remember him from back in the 50's and he was alot funnier. The same routines from the 50's that were on this dvd wasn't complete or he added stuff to them.  Not funny!!,1343520000,,284,4.222222222222222
2524436,5,B000ENUL98,This DVD brings back many joyous memories from my college days when I would go to see Bro Dave perform in-person at the Clermont Lounge in ATL.,1332720000,,143,4.333333333333333
2524437,2,B000ENUL98,"this is not the old brother dave,.....he is obciously older and the recycled jokes lose a lot of their sparkle.  obciouly a Labor of Love when filming, and impossible to use to encourage new fans to a[[recoate the Old Days of Dave....",1329955200,,234,4.571428571428571
2524438,2,B000ENUL98,"Dave was a good old boy back in his time, but time caught up with him and never is it more evident than on this DVD.  The jokes are the same ones he has been telling since the 1950's and 60's.  A few come off nicely, but a better amount fall flat mostly because of the passing of time.  I think seeing it live would have made a great difference in perspective.",1316995200,,360,3.9722222222222223
2524439,5,B000ENUL98,"If you've never seen Bro. Dave Gardner in person, this is as close as it gets.  He's funny, very entertaining and, in my opinion, has a wonderful singing voice and is a very intelligent.",1297296000,,186,4.470588235294118

8111787,3,B000ENUL98,"I'm a BIG fan of Brother Dave having enjoyed his southern humor during my 'teen years'.  While this DVD is from one of his performances, he is much older than the Brother Dave I remember.  His quick wit is missing and his presentation was a bit 'stale'.  The stories are my old favorites, but the delivery just leaves something missing.  Okay but, not great.",1459296000,,358,4.546875

Enjoyable though.",1429747200,,158,4.064516129032258
