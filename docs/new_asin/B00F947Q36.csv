8613239,3,B00F947Q36,I really like this series. this was number 3. it is well done. lots of action and comedy. However the reason I gave it only three stars is because I am deaf. and the titles are not subtitled. every TV show is captioned. these movies were captioned when shown on TV. So why no subtitled on the Blue Ray disk? Final note. you really need to see the first two movies before you see this one. as the story goes forward to make sense.,1429056000,,429,4.119047619047619
