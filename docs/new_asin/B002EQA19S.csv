3919287,5,B002EQA19S,"I've breastfed 10 children and had trouble everytime. I wish I would have watched breastfeeding basics with my first baby. The dvd covers several important areas of breastfeeding. From getting baby to latch on correctly, problems in breastfeeding to using a breast pump, Breastfeeding basics covers each issue completely.

The breastfeeding demonstations are great because they actually shows how to latch baby on correctly, different postions of nursing, etc.

I own a copy of Breastfeed: Mother to Mother and would recommend it to any mom whether she is planning to nurse her first baby or she is nursing her 10th like me.",1265068800,2,624,5.107843137254902
3919288,5,B002EQA19S,"Learning how to breastfeed a baby can be a challenge for some mothers.
Lack of support, lack of encouragement, fear of failure, and common
breastfeeding complications all contribute to so many mothers not
breastfeeding their babies long enough or avoiding breastfeeding
altogether. According to the CDC, while 73% of all women in the U.S.
choose to breastfeed their babies, only 13.6% are still breastfeeding
their babies at 6 months.

Breastfeeding: Mother-to-Mother is a peer-to-peer educational DVD that
is designed to inform and encourage new mothers with the goal of helping
to keep more babies on the breast longer by helping their moms be
successful. Nobody wants to fail, to be discouraged, or to be overcome
by complications when it comes to breastfeeding her baby. This DVD does
an excellent job at building confidence while showing how to breastfeed
and deal with the challenges. Highly recommended for first-time mothers
and mothers who want to give breastfeeding a try again.",1262822400,3,988,5.253164556962025
3919289,5,B002EQA19S,"Breastfeeding:  Mother to Mother is a must-have video for new mothers who want to successfully breastfeed their babies.  In a society where new mothers often have no one to help them nurse their babies, this video saves the day.  Having had five children and numerous years of breastfeeding experience, Jessica Solomon warmly demonstrates with her own children on the video exactly how to breastfeed properly and answers many of the common questions new nursing mothers have.  She explains several different nursing positions, techniques for solving latching problems, and solutions for most of the other problems that may be faced by nursing mothers.  This video would make a wonderful gift for an expecting first-time mother and would be a nice addition to the lending shelves of midwives and La Leche League leaders.",1261526400,3,819,5.221374045801527
3919290,5,B002EQA19S,"I was blown away when I saw this breastfeeding DVD. This woman knows her
stuff, and I learned a lot, to say the least. Great personable
presentation! Excellent up close demonstrations! A++! Recently, I bought
a copy for my niece who just had her first child. Highly recommended.",1261008000,3,278,4.8125
3919291,5,B002EQA19S,"Jessica Solomon's breastfeeding DVD is packed with tips, answers to both common and uncommon questions, and remarkable close-up demonstrations. As a mother of five children with over nine years of breastfeeding experience, Jessica is well qualified to provide any new mother with the basic information and tips she'll need to successfully breast-feed her baby.

The demonstrations are impressive. Jessica performs all the holds, the latch and unlatch, and some other techniques (e.g. using a nipple shield) with her adorable baby daughter Hannah. Her breast pump demonstration is very informative, especially the part on properly fitting the flange, and she follows that with a hand expressing demonstration. The unique way she instructs feels like you're casually sitting with a girl friend as she helps you learn how to nurse your baby with ease.",1253404800,4,848,5.424242424242424
3919292,5,B002EQA19S,"""Jessica, thank you so much for creating an instructional breastfeeding video in such an exquisite manner. Its beauty literally brought me to tears. Your willingness to allow others a brief glimpse into your nursing relationship with your daughters lends credence to the naturalness of the breastfeeding experience for mother and child. I wish I had access to something like Breastfeeding: Mother-to-Mother years ago when I gave birth to my first child and had to muddle through the learning to nurse process on my own, as the 'real-time' demonstrations of the different techniques and processes would have been tremendously helpful.

""I will definitely recommend Breastfeeding: Mother-to-Mother to pregnant friends and family members both for the wealth and quality of the information contained therein as well as for the openness and sincerity in which the information was portrayed. I foresee this video blessing and enriching the lives of so many women and their babies. I also guarantee that my own daughter as well as my future daughter-in-laws will be seeing, no, experiencing Breastfeeding: Mother-to-Mother many, many times.""",1253232000,4,1134,5.48
3919293,5,B002EQA19S,"A wonderful introduction to breastfeeding, Jessica covers common issues that first-time moms need to know, such as stimulating the rooting reflex, how to handle oversupply, nursing in different positions for different reasons, scheduling vs not, tandem nursing, and more.  Her experience as a mom of 5, and with babies born early or small, gives well-rounded advice you can trust.  Perfect for moms who want to make God's best feeding method work for their baby.",1252022400,6,462,5.22972972972973
3919294,5,B002EQA19S,"As a long time breastfeeding mother myself, I had forgotten how fearful I had been during my first pregnancy that I wouldn't be able to nurse my baby. I'd forgotten how I stared down at my nipple and wondered 'Where does the milk come out?' This video answers that question and many more with actual video of a woman breastfeeding her babies. The section on using a breast pump is priceless.

Breastfeeding Mother-To-Mother covers the entire breastfeeding relationship from getting started with a newborn, to nursing a toddler, to gentle weaning, along with all of the difficulties that can be encountered in between. Sound tips and advise from a mother who has been there.

This is a 'must see' for all women considering nursing a baby as well as for those having problems in an existing breastfeeding relationship and for those who assist other women with nursing. What you won't find here is another cold hospital environment with a doctor or lactation consultant roughly manipulating the breast of a woman trying to breastfeed.

From Jessica's heart we get the message that 'breastfeeding is wonderful for you and your baby.' And also that 'You CAN successfully breastfeed your baby, in spite of problems that may arise.' Then she gives the help needed to get over breastfeeding hurdles.",1249948800,12,1291,4.967592592592593
3919295,5,B002EQA19S,"I purchased this video when it was available as a download on the
filmmaker's website, and gave it to a friend who was expecting her first
baby. Naturally, before I gave it as a gift, I wanted to watch it
myself. My concern was that this breastfeeding DVD would be like others
I've seen, dogmatic and condescending. What I saw instead was an
experienced young mother (5 children!) sharing her knowledge about
breastfeeding in a unique and very personal way. She breast-feeds and
demonstrates virtually everything she discusses throughout the video
while she is talking. I was impressed, to say the least. Now I'm pleased
to see this video available for sale as a breastfeeding DVD on Amazon,
which makes it more convenient for me to give it as a gift in the future.",1247356800,11,765,4.7164179104477615
8368204,2,B002EQA19S,"If you have even the slightest clue about breast feeding save your money! Not very informative watch some videos on youtube, you would be better off. Don't really give you much help with the latching on when you are having trouble either. But there is a great youtube video that actually helped me! So new moms save your money!",1326412800,,327,4.559322033898305
8368205,1,B002EQA19S,"DO NOT BUY! This was a waste of money and you quickly find out a waste of time as well. Soloman doesn't appear to have any certifications other than being a woman who's done a lot of breastfeeding. Her entire presentation is a series of segments on her opinion regarding this topic, which most likely only work for her and her children. The video quality is poor, like it was made at home with a video camera. The only facts she provides are basic and things you've probably already read in a book about breastfeeding. WASTE OF MONEY!

Instead of this, highly recommend a book called The Essential Guide to Breastfeeding by Marianne Neifert, MD. This is informative, easy to read, and goes beyond what you would have experienced with this DVD.",1307750400,,743,4.628787878787879
8368206,1,B002EQA19S,"This dvd is horrible, if you are actually having issues breastfeeding I don't see how it will help you. The only thing this video did was drive me up a wall. The only part that she wasn't going ah or um every other word she was poorly reading from queue cards. Save your money and go see a lactation consultant instead.",1307491200,,319,4.245901639344262
8368207,5,B002EQA19S,"Simple, almost homemade... This video is much better than any books. It is made by a mom of 5 children who knows what she's doing and saying.
I am pregnant of my second child and i am using all the tools i need to succeed with breastfeeding this time.
I recommend this dvd to every new mom. It is simple, with a great approach and it doesn't leave any questions hanging.
UPDATE: October 15th, 2011;
My son is almost 3 months and he wants NOTHING but my boobs! It wasn't easy but it made things much easier. I didn't manage to breastfeed my first child and with my boy, four years latter I got through. I recommend watching the video before and after you have the baby.",1304726400,3,668,4.267716535433071
8368208,5,B002EQA19S,"I recently watched Breastfeeding Mother-To-Mother and found it to be full of helpful information. I am expecting my fifth child and desperately want to have a successful breastfeeding relationship with this baby. I lost my milk at four months with each of my first three babies. My fourth was stillborn and we didn't have a chance to try.

In Breastfeeding Mother-To-Mother Jessica (experienced mother of five) gives solid facts about how and why breastfeeding works, demonstrations to help the visual learner, and wonderful encouragement that YOU CAN breastfeed your baby! The demonstrations are discreet while still being plain enough to benefit from.

I would recommend Breastfeeding Mother-To-Mother to any woman who would like to learn how to successfully breastfeed her baby.",1297123200,2,781,5.446280991735537
8368209,5,B002EQA19S,"I received this dvd while pregnant with my first child. I wanted so badly to breastfeed! I would have nightmares when I was pregnant that I would give birth, but be unable to breastfeed. The possibility that I couldn't do it plagued me.

Watching this video really improved my confidence. Not only were the basics explained, but there is a whole section on getting around nursing difficulties. It answered many of the questions I had regarding breastfeeding and reduced the worry and stress I was experiencing on the subject. Jessica is so at ease with nursing and with her children that I couldn't help but relax!

When my son was born he latched on immediately. I have very large breasts so I had to nurse him in alternative positions for the first couple of weeks in order for him to stay latched on. All of the different nursing positions were demonstrated by Jessica in the dvd, so I was already familiar with them!

My son is now 5 months old and we have a great breastfeeding relationship. I highly recommend this dvd to any mother who has concerns about her ability to breastfeed and/or worries about complications that may arise.  This dvd will equip you with all the knowledge you need to have a successful breastfeeding relationship.",1295308800,,1244,4.71889400921659
8368210,5,B002EQA19S,"The title of this video is exactly right!!!! This video provide the type of mother-to-mother breastfeeding education and encouragement that would be shared between women. Not only does it help women know they really are doing things right, but it empowers them to be confident in being breastfeeding mother. All too often women second guess their decisions as mothers. Breastfeeding shouldn't be one of those areas.
I am a breastfeeding mother, a doula, a childbirth educator and a homebirth midwife. I recommend this video to women just to help increase their knowledge base and encouragement of the natural relationship that is breastfeeding. For many women, seeing the examples and seeing a seasoned breastfeeding mother in action, gives her the confidence to continue breastfeeding or to even make the breastfeeding decision. An overly clinical video removes the normalcy of breastfeeding. This video reinforces just how normal it is.
Some of the information is available in books. However, many women don't read those books. Many rely on lactation consultants, lactation educators, doulas and other breastfeeding mothers. So seeing this type of information in a video is refreshing.",1294185600,,1187,5.421621621621622
8368211,4,B002EQA19S,"I was surprised to start watching this DVD and see it looks like a home movie. Very cheaply made!

However, I think the information in the video was good. I'm about to be a first time mom and I feel more comfortable with the idea of breastfeeding and pumping after watching this video. She also goes through some of the common problems that people experience with breastfeeding such as Thrush, which is great to be aware of. I'd read books on breastfeeding, but I feel like seeing it in a video provided a better sense of what to expect.",1283558400,,537,4.424242424242424
8368212,5,B002EQA19S,"This DVD is simply a *must-have* for any mother who wants the ""inside scoop"" on breastfeeding!  I am a mother of five with baby number six on the way, so I know what I am talking about!  After my first baby was born, I was clueless, I mean CLUELESS about how to deal with my daughter not latching properly and what different holds I could try...and the dreaded engorgement.... If my sister-in-law had not been there to help me, I don't know if I would be the expert nurser I am today!  I may have given up, it was that hard.  Sudsequent babies were much easier, thankfully.

While watching this DVD, I found myself nodding and saying, ""YES!"" and ""Amen!"" I was astonished at the useful tidbits of valuable information she managed to cram into this DVD! The author shared things it took me five babies to finally grasp.  Seriously.

Doctors or nurses tell you about 10%-20% (if that) of what you need to know to be successful at breastfeeding... It's pathetic that I ever thought they would help me get started.  They didn't.  And at home, I was lost and alone after everyone left, and had a melt-down.  This DVD would have been a God-send!  Literally!

You may be asking yourself why is this DVD so special anyway?  Well let me tell you...
1) It is Mother-to-Mother... Not someone speaking lingo you can't understand.  Just a normal mom sharing her expert advice in a relaxed environment.
2) It packs in A LOT of information.  So much that you will want to watch it again and again.
3) It is organized so you can go to the issue you need to hear about should the need arise after baby is here.
4) It has information most books do not and things the doctor and nurses do not explain.  It takes experience to 'get it' and what better way to get ahead of the game than to get this DVD?
5) It is inexpensive.  Really, it's worth much more $ with all the information that is shared.
6) It is better than any book because you can actually SEE what to do.  I am a visual learner, so demonstration with a live baby is key for me.  It may be for you, too.

So, I strongly suggest that if you are pregnant or looking for a shower gift, or a welcome home baby gift, that you BUY THIS DVD!!!! It could prove to be someone's saving grace.  I can not recommend it any higher and would give it twenty stars if I could!!!

Thank God an experienced mother saw fit to help out the novices!!!  Trust me, the DVD is worth every penny!!!",1281312000,4,2415,4.29424778761062
8368213,4,B002EQA19S,"It had been a while since I was in the nursing seat...and the first time, it didn't go so well.
I found this dvd to be helpful, honest, and straightforward.  A good, detailed primer/refresher without the high-cost of a lactation class.",1266105600,4,235,4.7317073170731705
