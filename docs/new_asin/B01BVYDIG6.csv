You can use the DVDs as a beginner but don't expect to be able to just jump in and do this stuff. Expect at least 6 months just to master the stretches and thats if you are seriously determined.
Fortunately the DVDs are pretty long so it covers a lot more material than I expected.

There are several funny moments where they are scratching and the instructor pushes on the students. Also, if you're trying these exercises, you steadily feel the build up of stress as the next step is titled in such a way that leaves you with a sense of looming doom, like the backbridge...
if you don't find yourself saying omg at least once through the stretches then you're already a human pretzel and can move onto stage two.",1531872000,,889,4.620253164556962
