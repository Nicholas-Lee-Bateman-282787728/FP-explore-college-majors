8512564,4,B000A7B5Y8,Good video length (approx 40 min) for Pilates workout.  Instruction is excellent and steady.  Video recommended for someone with intermediate level strength and balance for Pilates (I have done mat classes for a little over 2 years).  Video presentation is calm (I generally prefer a more upbeat personality) but with very good instruction/information.,1178668800,5,352,5.60377358490566
