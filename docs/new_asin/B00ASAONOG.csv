8557357,1,B00ASAONOG,"Based on its surrounding text, I expected a low-budget, high-yield docudrama that told the personal stories of Sacco and Vanzetti, or nothing mind-blowing, but an interesting, more personal take on their stories. Instead I found a pseudo-documentary told from the perspectives of the Italian immigrants in their stereotypically broken English. The acting, cinematography, script is closer to par with a high school senior project than a full-length documentary. The first half of the film, leading up to the trial, is filled with cliches about Vanzetti finding work and being an immigrant, replete with scenes acting this process out instead of glossing over it with B-roll footage and moving on to the interesting parts. The story picks up later, most notably with Sacco and Vanzetti's courtroom arguments acted out, but even that isn't enough to offset the heavy-handed storytelling (ordeal about their political ideology but no explanations as to the stigma against them), campy acting (the overblown judge, for some reason played by Vanzetti), and other poor presentation issues. Since the premise of the documentary is the hidden story of the two, I had expected more primary sources cited and original synthesis rather than a simple, unsourced period presentation, which is the treatment subjects of this gravity deserve. There are better uses for your hour than watching this film, other documentaries, but especially other books.",1377561600,,1437,5.419642857142857
