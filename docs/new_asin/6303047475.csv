7835419,3,6303047475,"I am a very big fan of Billy (William) Petersen.  I initially bought this one because I thought it was a continuance of the character he played in another movie (CIA Exiled).  Turns out this is the same movie under a different name.  This movie was also under the name ""Curacao"".  Fairly decent movie, with good performances by both Petersen and also George C Scott.  If you are a fan of William Petersen, then this is a movie you can add to your collection. Although I would recommend if you prefer a DVD of it, then look for ""CIA - Exiled"" instead.",1201046400,,550,4.352941176470588
7835420,3,6303047475,"Deadly Currents is a decent film.  It's about an ex CIA who is in ""hiding"" in Curacao.  I enjoyed Billy's and George C. Scott's characters, and the scenery of Curacao.  Although not one of my favorites, I recommend it to fans of Billy Petersen.  It's a movie to watch on a rainy, snowy, or cold day or night with some popcorn.",1185667200,,326,4.295081967213115
