8257643,1,B001570GYC,"Great concept! Original idea...NOT! This movie was stolen from it's original director. The content, title, photographs and footage were used unlawfully and should have never been released. It's unfortunate that some ""film makers"" capitalize off of the hard work and artistic vision of others. The tradition of Black Cowboys is a unique subculture that has had little acknowledgment in American history. It is unfortunate that a misappropriated film like this is getting exposure.",1314835200,,479,5.575342465753424
8257644,1,B001570GYC,This was my first time using this seller and I was very disappointed in the merchandise. I put the cd in my machine and what came up was an error message...that said this cd may not have playback capabilities. I was disappointed after spending my money and wanting to impress my grandson with the black cowboys. I am sending it back.,1236470400,,333,4.475409836065574
