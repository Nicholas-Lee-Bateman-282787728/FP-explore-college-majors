8280756,3,B001B093S8,Bad movie - needs a lot of re-write.  Could be a fun movie if thought out more.,1468627200,,79,3.6470588235294117
8280757,5,B001B093S8,"How this is a Christian film, Idk. (Guess it could be a Catholic film, at best?). Anyways, It is a foreign film, (subtitled). I took it as a straight horror movie, and a gorgeous gothic feast for the eyes, at that! (Story is a bit lacking and campy, imo). But if you like vampire Gothic horror, Add this one to your Gothic Movie Collection!",1375142400,,340,4.328125
8280758,1,B001B093S8,This is not the original. This was washed over and made into a totally different movie. TOTALLY REGRET BUYING THIS!,1374278400,,115,4.8
8280759,2,B001B093S8,"While the movie is visually proficient, there's little else to recommend this dubbed Russian spooker. It's one of the worst dubbed films since GODZILLA.  The lead actor is awful and the rest are even worse!
The threadbare incohesive plot revolves around a journalist who poses as a murdered priest on his way to some small town to rid them of some witch's curse.  It's obviously supposed to be set in America but there is NOTHING American about this movie.  You might rent it for a laugh.",1251763200,3,488,4.651162790697675
8280760,5,B001B093S8,"I was surprised at how well filmed this movie was.  It is suspenceful, a good thriller.  It takes a Russian folklore of a demon and updates it, yet keeps the flavor of old world Russia.  Only complaint is that the movie is dubbed in English and a couple of places the words do not match up with the film.  Otherwise excellant!",1240704000,8,326,4.295081967213115
