3645269,5,B001HW85DY,"I used to have every Firm workout series on VHS.  It has been very difficult to find the original Firm series on DVD. I am so thankful I found these on Amazon!  These workouts guarantee results in 10 workouts. This particular workout w/ Jayne Poteet is a rather calm version of their other workouts, but it still is very effective, as are all their early workouts...My husband noticed a change in my body with only 5 workouts! I highly recommend the Anna Benson/Firm workouts to anyone. Be prepared to sweat and see your body change!!!!!",1310083200,6,537,4.6421052631578945
3645270,5,B001HW85DY,"I've been a firm believer since almost 20 years. I had them all in video format. My favorites were the firm #4, #5,#6, tHE tortoise, and The Hare and Five Days abs. Those workouts are the most, they shape your body in no time. I was looking forward to find them in DVD format and was really happy when found them. I am 51, three kids age 21,25 and 28, and in my best shape ever. The Firm shape your body without making you look bulky and the muscle confusing method give you opportunity to work hard without getting exhausted. My English is not the best , but I hope this review help other to make a decision. You won't regret.",1307404800,35,627,4.190082644628099
3645271,5,B001HW85DY,"My mom used to have this on VHS and did it all the time until the tape pooped out.  I am so happy to finally find this workout video on DVD!  It was such a good surprise for my mom, and I also bought one for myself and another for my aunt.  It is a great, full-body workout, and the outfits are quite entertaining, bringing back the 80's/early 90's vibe :)  You will need weights and a step to do the workout.  Good luck getting through the entire workout the first few times, it's tough!",1305763200,7,488,4.094736842105263
3645272,5,B001HW85DY,"Thanks so much for making The Firm Boomers, Vol. 6 available on DVD.  It's just what I've been wanting.  It's my all-time favorite The Firm workout.",1299542400,6,148,4.653846153846154
3645273,4,B001HW85DY,"While I do not believe it is the only program a person will ever need to buy for fitness, this is a very solid, approximately 53-minute workout with a lot going for it. Jayne Poteet is the warm, engaging and lovely lead here. Expect (with this being The FIRM) a highly-choreographed production, fairly precision form, a non-vocal jazzy soundtrack, and early 1990's clothing. However, I have owned this since around 1998 and I still use it. It's challenging without being exhausting or harsh, and I feel that it has aged very well.

You will start with a thorough warm-up of floor aerobics. Next it is on to a unique standing stretch by The FIRM, utilizing a dining room chair. (I almost always just modify and use a step bench of about 14"" in height for the additional support.) You'll do a set of floor aerobics following the warm-up; be advised that there is no high-impact work in this video at all. Then comes a step aerobics set using a fairly light barbell. (I don't know what the cast is using, but I use an 18-lb. body bar throughout the workout, and I'd consider myself intermediate-level. I'd recommend beginners practice with a broom handle, then move on to a 9 or 10 lb. barbell or body bar.) Another two sets of step aerobics (one of which includes a considerable number of biceps curls with dumbbells) are interspersed with a brutal and fairly long multi-set of box squats and hover squats. The squat sets are broken up by some much-needed ""rest"" in the form of barbell upright rows and military presses. After the final step aerobics set, 2 sets of tall-box leg presses are performed per leg. Between each of these two sets, you'll do calf raises. In between the sets for each leg in total, you'll do shoulder shrugs and pinches with the barbell. Women with an overly-developed trapezius muscle or any sort of neck nerve pinching issue, may want to replace these with another type of exercise. Before heading to the floor, you'll do triceps kickbacks, double-arm bent rows for the back, and rear deltoid lifts.

The floorwork begins with about six minutes of abdominal work, most of which has your lower legs supported on the taller box. A couple sets of pec flyes, a set of bridgework for the hamstrings and glutes, and a set of pelvic floor lifts will finish you up before the stretch. The stretch lasts 8 minutes, and is one the best The FIRM ever did. You will need a hand towel for this final stretch.

There are technically no real rest periods during this workout, so be prepared to hit your pause button in order to change equipment, mop your brow, and drink some water. A beginner should have a lower step (4"" minimum, 10"" maximum); a high step (beginners may want to start with 8""; very tall or very advanced could go up to 17"", but the average is 14""); at least 3 sets of dumbbells, 3-, 5-, and 8 lbs sets.; a barbell or body bar of about 9-10 lbs., perhaps with a light set of plate weights, and a hand towel. The barbell could be swapped out with dumbbells, but I really couldn't recommend it over the long haul, as I feel the weighted balance and grip change of a barbell is important here. Intermediate exercisers will need to add higher-weight dumbbells over time.

The choreography for all aerobic work is extremely basic. A very advanced exerciser could still get a decent workout in with high step heights and high dumbbell/barbell plate weights, but they may find this workout a tad plodding for their taste. (It will really depend on what their style is.) That said, when the step aerobics are performed on a 10-inch box (as Jayne performs it), one should get their heart rate up. One step aerobics set uses no weights in the hands. Beyond raising the step height, one could hold small wrist weights in the hands for some additional cardiovascular effect.

This workout does NOT have the following exercises: running in place; plyometric jumps; jumping jacks; lunges; tablework (where one is on the floor and on all fours to work the legs); outer thigh leg lifts; inner thigh leg lifts; chest (bench) presses; French (triceps) presses; or concentration (biceps) curls. While one does have to get on the floor for the final third or so of the workout, otherwise I would say it is among the more knee-friendly workouts done by The FIRM.",1281916800,,4270,4.635402906208719
3645274,5,B001HW85DY,"I love this video, and purchased and did the original VHS many, many times.  Admittedly, I have trouble following complicated aerobic footwork, so the simpler exercises in this one suit me very well.  All of the Firm videos are designed to give you a well-rounded workout, and this one is no exception.  I enjoy the ""original Firm"" set and the music:  the set is lovely and the music easy to listen to, and adds to the exercise experience for me.  I don't enjoy watching stark sets with only the instructor.

It's about 15 years or so after I bought the VHS tape, and now I'm 15 years older and again out of shape and look forward to working out to the DVD.",1272412800,7,657,4.344262295081967
3645275,5,B001HW85DY,"This is my favorite FIRM workout. I don't like fast-paced workouts so this one fits the bill perfectly and it's a much safer workout than other FIRM classic tapes. And it's never boring. Lots of people think that fast, exhausting type of exercises produce better results. In my opinion, slow workouts let you pay more attention to the forms and that awareness engages more muscles in any given movement. For example when doing the short- tall box workout, I consciously squat deeper and squeeze harder. When doing upright rows, I try to use lats as well as shoulders. The pace of this workout lets me be more aware of what I do. Also Jayne Poteet is an excellent instructor with her impeccable cueing. This workout is excellent for the rear - you will feel the burn! Although Susan Harris remains as my top favorite FIRM instructor, I love this workout more than hers (hers is for more advanced exercisers IMHO, except for FIRM vol. 4). If FIRM vol. 1 is too hard for you, you can start with this one and work up to vol. 1 or others.",1270944000,25,1033,4.5
3645276,5,B001HW85DY,"I've been using this workout in my monthly rotation since it first came out in 1989, and even after all this time, it still ranks as a very ""smart"" and usable routine.

Although technically, originally geared to ""adult"" (including ""mature"") exercisers, this workout is truly appropriate for nearly everyone. Granted, it no longer challenges me, as an advanced exerciser, but by adding intensity--plyometric moves, jumps, and bigger movements during the cardio sections, and by upping the weights during the strength portions--I'm still able to get a nice, balanced workout, in a relatively-short amount of time. And, on those rare occasions when something ""hurts"" (an over-exerted or pulled muscle, for instance), the slower pace and low-impact nature of the workout allows me to get my exercise in, despite any ""ouchies"". That, alone, makes this an invaluable addition to the serious home-exerciser's library.

For anyone who simply cannot get past the ""look"" of the '90s (hair, makeup, workout wear), I wouldn't recommend it. But, for anyone more concerned with the truly important things--getting a very good and safe workout--I give this classic gem a very high recommendation.",1251849600,12,1181,5.378378378378378
3645277,5,B001HW85DY,"I am so very glad this title came out on DVD.  I had the video for years and was worried that one day it would break and I would't find another video.

I started exercising 15 years ago with this video.  I lost over 30 pounds and gained tremendous stamina, muscle and strength.  (And not too much muscle.)  I have been looking for another video like this for years.

I liked the pace of this video - it teaches you how to lift weighs and do aerobics at a pace beginners can handle.  It isn't just dance routines.

It it a terrific video - relevant as much today as when it was released.  A must for every exerciser - especially someone who is new to it.",1240272000,33,619,4.230769230769231

3645290,4,B001HW85DY,"I am a big fan of the Firm workouts but most especially the Classic Ones.  Something about those old workouts are just much better than the new releases.  Don't know why they stopped using the high stepper, but I swear by the 'fanny lifter' and find the programs that feature it are the ones I returned to again and again.  The only thing I missed in this workout was push ups, which are absolutely essential.  So reminder when you use this workout, use the hold and do two sets on your own.

3645292,5,B001HW85DY,This the best exercise program. I have been using it for years and VHS tape finally wore out. I was thrilled to find it in DVD. It really gets you in shape.,1383955200,4,156,3.90625
3645293,5,B001HW85DY,"I have used this ""tape"" since 1992, ordered it several times over the years as this is my ""go-to"" workout when I want to get in shape after an exercise hiatus.  My last tape finally ""died"" and I was worried that I would never do Boomers again.  Thrilled to log onto Amazon.com and find that it has been re-released on DVD! I ordered two! One to keep and home and one for travel.

The exercise itself is challenging, but there is something about the low impact, the music, and Jayne Poteet that have become like second nature to me.  It's like inviting your best friend over for a workout.  I sometimes get lazy, don't alway work out, but as The Firm touts, just 10 workouts to see a difference and you do!  (I think doing any exercise for 10 hours will give you results though.)

I've read other reviews about the big hair, the neon leotards, etc., but this IS my era!!! I embrace it.  I love this Classic Series far better than the newer versions, but those are just as effective.

Exercise how you wish, but for me, I give this one 5 stars!",1370563200,8,1042,4.302564102564102

3645295,5,B001HW85DY,"I really love this workout. It is not my favorite out of the top 6 FIRM Classics, but this one is different from the other 5.
Here is the breakdown of all Classics (1-6):

Vol 1 (w/Susan Harris)-more fast paced, more ""lower body"" emphasis (a killer floor leg rutine), and a huge ""results"" workout!

Vol 2 (Low Impact Aerobics)-more slower paced than vol 1, more ""4-limbed cardio"" (which is my personal fav type of workouts), and a more ""upper body"" workout than Vol 1.

Vol 3 (Interval Training)- more ""up and down"" type of workout (as with Vol 1-you kind of do a mix of cardio and weight work, Vol 2 is a upper body cardio then to floor work, and Vol 3 is alternating both). This one I feel is a more ""total body workout""..without emphasis on just either upper or lower. This one is my #1 FAVORITE of the Classics from Vol 1-6.) ;)

Vol 4 (Time Crunch)- is a GOOD circuit type workout that gets everything packed in a 30-40 min timeframe. LOVE this one as my 2nd most FAV of the Classics from 1-6. Like Vol 3 is a solid total body workout (but no floor work except abs).

Vol 5 (Abs, Hips & Thighs) - a good shorter total body workout but a bit longer than Vol 4, but is definatly more emphasis on Lower Body and Ab work-also has the LONGEST ab work in all the classics. I really like this one as well. The short cardio step workout when she uses fast delt lifts and upright rows while stepping sort of in a ""off beat"" way, is the only time I really felt a good arm workout-so I LOVE that part! :)

And now Vol 6......a very slower paced, but still challanging workout. At first (years ago) when I started using this videos (back in 95), I first thought this one was a bit more boring and the cardio was sort of a ""why bother"" type of feel. BUT...when she goes into the sqauts, and hover squats, then it changed my attitude. This one I feel was a more introduced for anyone who is starting out the FIRM, or for those who didn't like the faster paced ones, and with this video it IS easier to use lighter or heavier weights because the moves are more slow and controlled. Do not be fooled like me in the very beginning. You may think its not that tough or that the step segments are a bit boring and repetitive (but they are short, so don't worry). You WILL still get a decent solid workout with this one. :)

I also put this workout in the catagory of the ""Tortoise"" (with Tracie Long)..as this one sort of has the same kind of slower pace feel to it (even tho the Tortoise workout is not the same)...the moves are slow and more controlled. If you love this workout, please do get the Tortoise and Hare workouts :)",1347148800,29,2615,4.218
3645296,5,B001HW85DY,"What can I say about this workout that hasn't been said?  Slightly shorter than the other Firm classics at about 44 minutes and targeted for ""boomers,"" the workout has senior citizens and a US Marine participating.  It's led by the beauteous Southern charmer, Jaynee Poteet, who does a magnificent job leading and demonstrating proper form.  You'll need a barbell, dumbbells, a tall box (I use a Rubbermaid) and a short box.  You'll feel thoroughly worked out and invigorated when you're done.  This will improve your posture, your stamina and give you a gloriously proportioned body.  As with all the Firm classics, the workout uses classical music and is lushly filmed.",1338422400,5,671,5.054545454545455
3645297,5,B001HW85DY,"Although, I slowly acquired all the first like eight Firm video workouts, this workout and Volume 1 are my two favorites.  The Boomers workout is excellent and the music is great.  As I stated in my review of Volume 1, please be patient with yourself.  When I first started purchasing The Firm workout videos (and they were $50 for VHS) in the late 80's and 90's, I had NONE of the equipment, and slowly...very slowly I built up my little stash of stuff, but I was still able to do the workouts, so don't let not having all the things they use in the video stop you from doing it.  The stools they used back then were dangerous, disastrous and they tipped.  I use my set now as little foot stools and one as a little table (so much for those wooden stools for exercise, but have one to elevate my feet as I'm typing right now).  And, I used a Rubbermade step stool that was far more sturdy at the time.  Now I have the set of plastic ones which are VERY balanced, but it took me years to acquire them.  If you have any kind of step device, and you're sure you won't slip, then use it.  And if you feel that you're not yet ready for the step part (or never will be), just do the exercises without it.  There are plenty of parts of the video you can do.  There are many days where I literally walk through certain parts of this routine...when I just don't have the balance or strength.  And that's all right.

Do only what you can and after the initial soreness wears off, you should start slowly to look and feel much better and gain strength. I've tried many other types of workouts and although I do love Yoga workouts, the other ones either aren't enough or are WAY too jolting and dangerous for my 60+ year old body.  And if you think you might like to start out even more slowly, I would suggest the Body Parts workouts.  At one point in the late 90's when I could barely do anything...I did the one for abs, and the floor workouts a couple of times a week and then walked, and I could maintain my svelte little body.  ""Best to do half measures than nothing at all"" was my mantra at the time.  These videos have helped me so much.

I hope this review has helped you too.",1334707200,22,2174,4.185096153846154

I have a regimen of cardio, resistance and total body that I rotate, and this particular tape I use as a part of the resistance it is a burner.

The rest of my day was sedentary.  In the beginning, I had to stop to rest frequently during the workout, and gradually increased the weights I used.  By the end of winter, I was strong and very trim!

That summer, I went distance swimming with my army brother who had just passed his fitness test, including a 10 mile run with a 60 pound backpack.  I was able to power through the water beside him even on sprints.  He expected to leave me behind, but couldn't, and had to know why (Oh, just a girly exercise video in my living room).  I had not been swimming in several years; it was just from doing this workout.  So is this effective?  You bet!  Career Army guy was extremely impressed.  Dumbfounded, actually.

And I was in the best shape of my life!

Back then, during winter I had to exercise every day or live as a zombie, and didn't know as much as I do now, and had no other workout videos.  In hindsight, give yourself a day off in between workouts and you'll make better progress.  I still love doing Firm workouts regularly, and have many of them.
