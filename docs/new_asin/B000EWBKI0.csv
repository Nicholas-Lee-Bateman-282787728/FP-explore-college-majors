2541551,5,B000EWBKI0,"The record of the brave and dedicated African American service men  and women during WWII has been a long time in coming.  This film will hopefully spark an interest in their invaluable service to their country at a crucial time in our history.  I thoroughly enjoyed the performances and story, especially the scenes in Ireland.",1147392000,17,328,4.927272727272728

2541588,4,B000EWBKI0,Good bit of hidden history. African American military people finally acknowledged for their contributions to America's victory in WWII. Looking for more of this kind of movie/documentary.,1486339200,,187,5.962962962962963

2541590,5,B000EWBKI0,"How could this movie get only 1 star?  I clicked on it because I love Navy movies and I had yet to see this one.  This movie had me spellbound.  Oscar worthy? Maybe not but it is definitely worth watching.  I loved it so much that I had to buy it so that I could watch it again.  Why not watch it while it is on Prime for free?  You will not have wasted any of your time.  This movie had me laughing, smiling and even crying.  One of the reasons is because of the indignity and discrimination that the black had suffered during this time in our country.  But yet they were willing to put their life on the line for our country.  I also hated the fact that their commendation that they should have received back then was not given to them just because of the color of their skin.  Ossie Davis, was a great actor and is missed.  Darnell Williams (All My Children) is in this also and does a great job.  The other 3 actors (I don't know their names) are great too.  It was also nice seeing. Denise Nicholas in this movie also, I loved her in Room 222.",1486166400,4,1048,4.073529411764706

2541605,5,B000EWBKI0,I'm giving this film 5 stars because it showed a side of the military during WWII that was rarely talked about before...the discrimination against blacks in the military by whites they served alongside.  This hit home for me because my grandfather was a sailor during WWII in the Pacific Ocean and I remember him telling me about the discrimination he and other black sailors faced.  He was not allowed to fight...until the war got extremely intense; then everyone (white & black) had to fight alongside each other...together.,1485820800,4,526,5.0344827586206895

2541628,5,B000EWBKI0,"Excellent depiction of the difficulties and real life experiences of black servicemen, most of them highly qualified, who were nevertheless not meaningfully acknowledged for their valuable contributions in the Battle of the Atlantic.  At the time, due to prejudice in the navy, they were treated as second class citizens, not recognized for the valor they exhibited.  It was not until much late that they got the recognition they deserved.",1485561600,,439,5.3478260869565215
2541629,3,B000EWBKI0,Compelling story - sensed that it was more accurate than sensationalized.  These men deserve the credit and respect at the very least conferred on the Tuskegee Airman,1485388800,,166,5.148148148148148

2541671,5,B000EWBKI0,"Perhaps I'm just old.  I found this to be an excellent movie. The harsh reviews I think are unfair as this film is a history lesson - to the extent that it can be - as opposed to a film of entertainment and therefore special effects, moments of intense and suspense are not necessary.  Just tell the story and that's what this film does...albeit basic.  Yes, it does speak of America's racism and that is not a victimization, but a reality as to how it was.  My uncle who was a part of the infamous Red Ball Express told his story the same way...what he faced on these shores and abroad in terms of race, but also of how his unit overcame all that and changed the course of the war. Any Ossie Davis film is going to present this way or very similar so I knew what to expect. An excellent film for anyone who is interested in some basic history.",1484438400,2,844,4.191358024691358

2541702,5,B000EWBKI0,It was a fantastic movie. It tells about the struggles that the enlisted black men had to go through in the Navy. They were only 1 of 2 black enlisted crews on combat ships. We never heard about this in the history book. I would really like to know why!!,1475020800,,254,4.1

2541716,3,B000EWBKI0,"This is a good story, but the movie was made on a small budget. Ossie Davis is fine in his role, and I was surprised by a cameo appearance by Aidan Quinn. The rest of the actors are amateurish and wooden, which distracts from the quality of the story. I agree with another reviewer, who said that the examples of racism in the film also distract from the story. In one scene, the petty officer in charge of the sonar refuses to notify the captain of a possible u-boat contact because one of the black crewmen expressed his opinion that the captain should know about it. According to the filmmaker, this PO would rather risk his ship being sunk than send a warning about a possible u-boat to the captain. Pretty sure that never happened.

This film is a decent way to spend an hour and a half, just don't expect to be wildly entertained.",1472083200,,836,4.393548387096774

It is just incredible that the African American men served in World War II and fought and died for their country and when they returned home and disembarked from the troop ships and came down the gang planks they had signs sending ""colored soldiers one way and ""whites"" the other.
I saw this in a documentary film I was watching several years ago.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  It brought me to tears.  Not that it makes any
difference but it just so happens that I am a white southern man.  Maybe someday, just maybe.",1463529600,8,654,4.371900826446281

I am a retired US Navy Master Chief and served 30 years (1966-1996), yet never heard of USS Mason (DE-529) and her all African American Crew during WWII. This is a story that needs telling, unfortunately this movie doesn't do it very well.

The acting is mediocre at best and that may be doe to a poorly written story or just bad production.  I struggled through the movie, more like a documentary really, and a poor documentary at that. I would give the acting, production, and overall movie a two to three star rating, but I did like the overall story and its impact, so 4 stars.",1440892800,,673,4.4471544715447155

The last 5 minutes were the best of the film, (minus the fact that former Pres. Bill Clinton was speaking). They never once show the ship as a whole they are filming on. They make it look like the ship is departing the dock, by means of moving the camera along, BUT OOOPS, there's the anchor line still attatched to the ship. There is an ignorant predjudicial CPO who is the bad guy at various moments, he throws the ""colored"" sailors dog over board, but is not busted, just transfered, and then as he departs the ship, with full rank, he turns and tells the crew with the white Captain right there that he hopes they all die. HAHAHAHAHA! C'mon man, really? If this was Ossie Davis's last film credit, I hope he passed before he got to see the finished project. I love war movies, cheesy, old, or out dated, but this was PATHETIC! Don't waste your time.

The movie feels more like a political propaganda than anything else. Awfully primitive characters, boring lines full of tearful speeches and excessive use of voice-over just add to the effect. Characters are so simple and so wonderful, always smiling, clean and nice, so perfect in every way that it's almost a parody. There is hardly anything happening in the movie. No twists in the plot, no surprises. Characters are either good or bad, like in a child book. No room for dilemmas. Nothing to think about, no challenges for the viewer. Everything is obvious.

Racism is bad, patriotism is good - that's basically the entire movie. I'm not kidding, it's all.

It's as if the script was written by 12 years old idealistic american boy. It's not a movie, it's a commercial.

So, if you didn't know before that racism is bad and hate movies to make you think or give you hard problems to ponder about, then by all means watch ""Proud"".

Although things were very hard on the blacks during WWII, it really distracted from the great accomplishments of the great Sailors of the USS Mason.  Through there was racism, many Americans were grateful for the service of all Americans Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen.  There are great war stories of Japanese-American, African-Americans, Jews, Germans, etc. and their trials and tribulations without trying to overwhelm us with a hate message to evoke a reaction and distract from the true accomplishments and heroism of all who participated in the war.

  Beyond that, I found this to be a great piece of ""forgotten"" history.  Its a shame that these men, who served their country so honorably had to wait so long to receive their commendations.  How much of our country's history has our military hidden just because of the color of the man's skin?  How often do people have to prove that one man is just as good as the next?  I was glad to see that in the end, these men finally get their commendations.  But what about the men who have passed since the original recommendation was turned in?  They deserve the same respect as those still living from all of us.  I was glad to see that the grandson didn't give up on going after what he and his friends believed his granddad deserved.
  All in all, I found this to be a great movie and would recommend it to everyone who is interested in learning as much as they can about our country's ENTIRE history!!!!!!",1406160000,2,1121,4.404878048780488

2542082,2,B000EWBKI0,"Based on the true and heroic story of the USS Mason, a Navy battleship manned by an African-American crew during WWII, when segregation was still enforced. Based on the book by Mary Pat Kelly.

The pros

Some pretty solid performances by the cast. Some scenes were very enjoyable. Nice to see a all African American cast and no one is a drug dealer,pimp or thug. Glad to see these events portrayed on film. The scene with them visiting some Irish people was very enjoyable. Footage of actual navy vessels in battle. Ending of the film has footage of Bill Clinton talking with some of the surviving crew members.

The cons
I hated how they couldn't decide if they wanted to be documentary or a movie. You have Ossie Davis talking all over the film explaining things I don't need that just show what happened in the film. Man the sets were kind of cheap in the film. You could tell they didn't have much money for this film. I didn't get some of the choices in term of script. They wasted a lot of time with one character interviewing other charters in the film. This happened a few times. I'd have rather they spent this time doing something more interesting. Also during the battle scenes they use actually footage of real navy ships in battle. This would be cool if the scenes weren't in black and white. I found this really jarring at times. It really took me out of the battles. Also the main antagonist who was causing them problems get taken out of the picture 40% into the film. I know it's based on real life,but it hurt the film. You don't get rid of the main bad guy so soon.

In conclusion I'd say good idea with poor execution. Don't know why some people gave it such a high rating,but don't be fooled.",1283299200,2,1713,4.4113924050632916

I did not know anything about the USS Mason and its crew until I ordered the movie and watched it.  Ossie Davis, Darnell Williams and the other actors in the movie were astounding.

One of the Navy's smallest ships on the roughest seas. They called this an experiment for the Navy. I don't know if the Navy claims to have proven their point, but those black sailors sure proved theirs. Considering the excellent job that those men did the Navy should have manned other ships with an all black crews. I'm white, and a southern boy at that, but we southerners recognize a job well done.

It is so unfortunate that it took the United States Navy so long to recognize the valor and courage of these young men.

It is the true story of how the first all-African American crew overcame prejudice and adversity while risking their lives for this country during World War II. The film tells the story very well, and is interspersed with actual black and white footage of the original USS Mason crew. The cinematography is exceptional, especially the scenes shot in Derry, Ireland. This is Tommy Hilfiger's first motion picture effort from his THEntertainment production company. Note there are several cameos throughout the film, including Tommy and Ally Hilfiger, Nobel Peace winner John Hume, and the three main characters who are still living: Lorenzo DeFau, Gordon Buchanan, and James Graham.
