4854409,5,B005OSUKQ2,Love to watch this over and over again.  I listen to this often and am a big fan or Pavarotti.  This is the best thing to listen to over the holidays or whenever.,1422921600,3,162,3.878787878787879
4854410,1,B005OSUKQ2,I ordered this for a gift and come to find out type O does NOT play in every DVD player.  Frankly I am not sure what DVD player it does work in since I have tried 3 different ones.  Please put this info into your description!!  I know have an 83 y.o. Aunt who can't wait to see it and I can't find anything other then the O.  If I had known this I would not have ordered it.  Very disappointed!!!,1407024000,3,396,3.8395061728395063
4854411,1,B005OSUKQ2,"The Pavarotti DVD would not play in my player. The ""O"" type of DVD is not compatible with my player and therefore I had to sadly return the DVD",1397520000,,143,3.9655172413793105
4854412,4,B005OSUKQ2,This is a DVD with an outstanding selection of Pavarotti  Christmas Classics. Most of the classics are not in English but this should not be off setting. Unfortunately the quality of the DVD is very dated and the visual quality not the best but certainly acceptable. Overall I am thrilled that the amazing talent of Pavarotti can live on through his past Christmas performances. My family enjoyed this production during the holiday season.,1388361600,4,439,5.013698630136986

8481754,1,B005OSUKQ2,"I love this performance. I bought 2 copies of this dvd in January 2017. I then waited til Chistmas season to play them. Unfortunately, they do not play on any of the 9 dvd players I have in both of my houses. No notice that this was region 2 or some other restriction. Amazon policy does not permit the return of items after 11 months. I'm out my payment for 2 dvds and still do not have the music I love. Amazon should provide accurate product information in future. Better yet, since writing this review, I have found that this is a common problem with this product. Amazon should withdraw this product and refund the money of those of us who thought they could expect Amazon not to offer clearly defective products.",1512345600,2,718,4.446969696969697
