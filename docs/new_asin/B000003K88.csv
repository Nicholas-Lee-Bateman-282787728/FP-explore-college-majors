  This is a wonderful story--the tape plays very well.  It is so nice to see the cast out of StarFleet clothing and enjoying themselves as characters in Dr. Bashir's holostory gone amiss.  I really love it--it brings back alot of memories....

If you like the spy genre, you'll love it that much more. Avery Brooks, Nana Visitor, Colm Meaney, Terry Farrell and Michael Dorn take turns as characters in a James Bond-esque fantasy realm. Brooks is electrifying, you mostly forget he's Sisko. The interaction between Garak and Bashir adds to the fun, especially with Garak making wry comments like ""Kiss the girl, get the key. They didn't teach us that in the Obsidian order."" Buy it, you'll watch it a thousand times. I know I have.",994291200,5,653,4.7368421052631575
7902592,5,B000003K88,"While it's ultimately another rehash of the tired old Trek storyline of holodeck playtime turning into a no-escape live-fire exercise, it's also an excellent spoof of the secret agent genre.  Garak is almost constantly chastising Bashir for romanticizing his old job as an intelligence operative, while Bashir is just looking to have a good time.  Also, the names of the female characters are just straight out of earlier Bond movies, like Mona Luvsitt (""loves it""), Anastasia Komananov (""come on and off"") and Honey Bare.",982454400,5,522,5.2023809523809526
7902593,4,B000003K88,"I was not able to catch all of the episodes of DS9 in it's original run but was fortunate to see this one both as a first run and again as a rerun later in the season. This episode is a welcome respite from the continuing saga of the conflicts between the Maquis, Cardassians, the Dominion, etc. It's an enjoyable spoof of the James Bond movie series and all of the DS9 characters turn in excellent performances. It all comes about because of an ""accident"" that effects a holosuite program of Bashir's while he is in the holosuite - along with an uninvited Garak. This is a great example of what Trek writers are capable of creating outside the usual (and predictable!) continuing storylines. I don't why 'Viewer from Los Angeles' has such a harsh review of this episode - - go back to memorizing where all the restrooms are on all the starships and let the rest of us have our fun!! And by the way......the word is ""worst"" not ""work"". You should get to ""work"" on your spelling before it gets ""worse""!! (And lighten-up.......Star Trek is a creation of fiction!! Be a purist.....but be reasonable!)",977788800,,1097,4.573604060913706
7902594,5,B000003K88,"If you're a fan of Garak and/or Bashir, you *must* own this episode. They're both in top form here, and the campy '60s spy setting leads to a realistic battle of wills.
The other regulars are obviously having a fabulous time getting into their holosuite roles, and good old Rom gets a chance to shine too.",973296000,,305,4.464285714285714
