8590733,1,B000LXH4FA,I haven't even bought this DVD and I especially don't want to now. Knowing that whoever produced this thing has know idea what our team name is (War Eagles?) disgusts me even more. This is just some wannabe that I'm sure has every other Div. I school with the same type of DVD. Awful.,1210636800,,284,4.277777777777778
8590734,1,B000LXH4FA,Riddled with errors and a complete waste of any Auburn fans time.  If you buy this DVD you will be greatly dissappointed and very angry.,1173225600,3,136,4.44
8590735,1,B000LXH4FA,"Basically an NFL scouting presentation of drafted Auburn players from the last 10-12 years.  Same script dialog used for like position players with different name inserted.  A number of times descriptions of players are: ""player X contributed greatly to the War Eagles during their career.""  Just not worth the dough.",1173225600,4,317,5.3
