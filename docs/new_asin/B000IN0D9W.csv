8146510,4,B000IN0D9W,"This dvd is far better than his previous one. His tone has changed to being more relaxed and instructive as opposed to his usual superior monotone way. I found the material much more interesting and wanted more at the end of the video. The Major doesn't have those cheesy side kicks which seemed to distract you in the other video. There are scenes which are dramatized but stresses the point rather than laughter. He also shows different seasons and night shots which answered some questions. I feel he's still holding back and only instructing to civilians. If you're going to put out a video with that title, then show what real Military sniping is all about in today's world. That being said he does a good job with this dvd.",1216425600,8,729,4.615384615384615
