7616403,5,B01B1LE304,GREAT MOVIE.. MORE BELEAVEABLE..,1461283200,,32,7.25
7616404,5,B01B1LE304,Beautifully done rendition of the Trapp family's saga as it really happened. Great for family viewing.,1461283200,,102,5.4375
7616405,5,B01B1LE304,It took some getting used to separating the Sound of Music from this movie (as Maria in this real portrayal was no Julie Andrews ) ..but What a treat to learn what the real Von Trapps were all about.,1461283200,,199,4.128205128205129
7616406,5,B01B1LE304,"I really enjoyed this film , I am a big fan of The Sound of Music and have watched the original film and the American Live TV production many times on DVD. I was interested to see this film as I knew the true story was different to the movie. The story is told through the eyes of Agatha who was changed to Liesel in the musical. Agatha is the oldest and she loves to sing as a child , the children put on concerts for there Fathers birthday and are happy but there mother is unwell. Agatha loves her parents and after her mother dies she vows not to sing again. The family move to Salzberg and Agatha leaves behind her childhood friend along with her childhood as she helps her Father run the house. In this story we don't have the baroness in love with the Captain. Agatha is the loyal daughter who has to allow her father to love again , when Maria comes and takes over Agatha,s duties she has to let go. I really enjoyed the Father and Daughter relationship between Agatha and the Captain and this has echoes for Agatha,s niece in the flash forward with her own Father another highlight is the return of Agatha's childhood friend and the begi nings of young love. The story is very touching and sad in parts . Matthew McFayden was great as the not so stern Captain very believable in the role and Eliza Bennett is the star of this movie a great performance also Rosemary Harris as the older Aunt Agatha puts in a lovely and very moving performance a must for Sound of Music lovers and also for those who want to know a bit more about the Von Trapped Family.",1461196800,9,1561,4.2592592592592595
7616407,5,B01B1LE304,"For those of you who have seen the movie THE SOUND OF MUSIC, you probably know it is based on the Von Trapp family and their flight from Austria when the Nazis were invading Europe. This particular story is told by Agathe Von Trapp, the oldest child, in the Von Trapp family.
The movie shows the family with Agathe as a young child and her mother is gravely ill. The mother eventually dies and the captain and his children move to Salzburg , Austria.

The movie spans a period more than ten years. Within that period of time Maria enters as the new nanny and marries the captain. I am sure this all sounds familiar. However you will see more in depth the feelings of Agathe as the oldest and conflicts with her father and new step mother. There are resolutions to the conflicts as the movie progresses. The love of the family, the love of their country, and their desperation to keep everyone safe become more apparent as they escape Austria.

In all aspects of the movie you will see how important music was in their lives. Everyone sang including Maria .

There are differences between Agathe's recollections and the movie of course. You will see though, how THE SOUND OF MUSIC became the story of the Von Trapp family.

I really think you will enjoy this movie. I feel it is a movie for a family to watch although but maybe not very young children. The acting is well done, the scenery is beautiful and you truly get a glimpse into the life the Von Trapp family had in Austria.

7616408,5,B01B1LE304,A  Visually beautiful film with  moving performances  and  a well written script !  The story before Maria arrives  is especially of interest as it  complement The Sound of Music .  The last half of the pictures covers the same ground as The Sound of Music except from a different view point but equally as moving  and a bit close to the real story.  There could have been more music as the original Von Trapp Family voices were lovely and what music there is in this film is totally delightful .  Like The Sound of Music it is a film to be view many time and always enjoyed.,1460160000,3,575,4.280373831775701
7616409,5,B01B1LE304,"While this movie has the flavor of a Hallmark/American Girl production in it's tenderness, it is a remarkable companion piece to the Sound of Music. Told from the POV of the eldest daughter Agatha it is a multi-generational narrative about the Von Trapp's and their experience. The costumes, cinematography, and integrity are wonderful. If you are looking for a great afternoon family movie this is a good choice.",1460073600,24,413,5.088235294117647
7616410,5,B01B1LE304,Beautiful story,1514419200,,15,7.0
7616411,4,B01B1LE304,"Im surprised that so many people still think the Sound of Music movie with Julie Andrews was mostly fact but it was very fictionalized from the true story - go back and read the books by Maria Von Trapp or google. Yes, Agathes viewpoint was her own and as the eldest daughter, felt the loss of her mother acutely. But its good to get her view, put that ttogether with the other books and resources and get a more balanced overall understanding of this interesting and inspiring family!",1513468800,,485,4.5227272727272725
7616412,5,B01B1LE304,Loved the movie,1511740800,,15,4.333333333333333
7616413,4,B01B1LE304,"Definitely worth watching as a fresh take on the fictional telling of the Von Trapp family. I love the Julie Andrew's musical albeit far removed from the reality that the Von Trapp family lived. This new movie is sort of a 'Hallmark' sweetened version of what was going on politically at the time before Germany invaded Austria in 1935 (which Hitler titled 'reunification). The script strongly refers to the violence of political factions but shows very little of it, my guess is so it can be viewable by younger people. Presently this film is unrated. For parents, note that there's one scene of a key character being beaten, but no blood shown and no closeup images. That's the only shown violence. This movie's version centers from the perspective of Agathe (the eldest daughter). Eliza Bennett plays the part of Agathe with sensitivity and acting / vocal excellence; She is delightful. The ages of the other children are so 'off' eg all children seemed grown up by the time Maria Von Trapp appears on the scene, whereas historically, Agathe was 9 years old when her real mother died, and was only 14 when her step-mother Maria Von Trapp appeared as tutor then nanny. In this movie Agathe is depicted as perhaps 18+ when Maria arrives and all the other girls seem 15+ which pure creative liberty, maybe because they could only find good singers that were older? But the dynamic is correct and interesting to watch play out, in that Agathe basically was the matriarch of the family and mother to the younger children for more than 5 years, but then was totally displaced when the dominating Maria arrived from the Abbey. By all accounts of behavior from real interviews of the real family, Maria Von Trapp may have been 'on the spectrum'; But in all movies she'll always be portrayed simply as 'spirited'. The most factual version of the Trapp family I've seen is the original German movie. Whereas by the time that German movie was altered into out beloved America 'Sound of Music', it already had the truth of their immigration edited out; A whole new ending was written in which shows America in a better light (vs what really happened on Ellis Island). But at least both those early movies and also this new 2015 version from Agathe's view, do not have the musical's fictional escape of walking into the Alps towards Switzerland. Historically the record is that the whole family all got a train to Italy, and moved to other countries from there; They weren't stopped at the border because Captain Von Trapp had dual citizenship/ passports including Italian Citizenship. Anyway, there are many lovely moments and new insights this movie adds to what is one of our now favorite stories to relive. There is cultural clothing, both quaint Bavarian/ Austrian and sophisticated Salzburg architecture, arrays of Austrian food plates so tempting I could almost smell the dishes, and the family's close staff  members probably more accurately portrayed. This film seems to be from Agathe's real memories. Fortunately many high powered actors took roles in this film, including Matthew McFayden (aka Pride and Prejudice's Darcy), plus world acclaimed opera singer Annette Dasch. And Rosemary Harris, as elder Agathe (who is doing the story telling present time for the whole flashback to occur) is a warm, cuddly elder elegance.

Definitely worth a view. The kids singing it not very good, but the character that plays Agathe has a spectacular voice. While most of us willl always go back to the 'Sound of Music' fantasy, this film version has value and gives cultural and psychological perspective.",1510099200,3,3595,4.920922570016474

I kept expecting the story to follow the musical movie and this movie is quite a bit different. The feeling I got is that this is a story about an entirely different family. Even though The Sound of Music was dramatized and poetic license was taken about some aspects of the story it is the movie we all came to love. This movie, A Life of Music, is more like a Hallmark Channel offering, nice but just not as engaging as the original.",1475366400,2,545,4.25

Now onto my review of the movie: although I enjoyed the story line told through the daughter's view, I found myself thinking that in some spots the movie dragged on a bit too long. The opening scene with the eldest running away just didn't do it for me. Those opening scenes I felt would've been better used elsewhere.

Told from the perspective of the eldest daughter, we learn more about the family before Maria arrived and much more about what life was like after Maria married Captain Von Trapp (Matthew Macfadyen who also played Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice). In ""The Sound of Music"" the timeline was shortened and it appeared that the family made their escape shortly after the Maria and the captain returned from their honeymoon. In fact, there were years between those events and much more to the story. Very, very interesting. Highly recommended.",1466812800,2,679,4.913043478260869

It was interesting to compare similarities to the Sound of Music, and to see where there were differences. Set during the time Hitler was coming to power, it shows some of the political and interpersonal tensions going on, and how that affected the family. Good for The Sound of Music fans. Enjoyable feel-good movie.",1464825600,,434,4.723684210526316

7616499,1,B01B1LE304,"As a long-time Sound of Music and Von Trapp fan, I could not be more disappointed in the details which this film messed up.  While it is supposedly based on the book Agathe Von Trapp wrote (I have read it numerous times), it containted 11 critical plot errors and was at least as erroneous as The Sound of Music ""Hollywood"" version.  Since this film was trying to do a more accurate job of telling the story (since it was based off a real Von Trapp's book), the least they could have done was to make it more accurate than the original movie, but sadly they didn't.",1464652800,10,565,4.320754716981132
7616500,5,B01B1LE304,I ran across this film by accident and I'm so glad I did. Beautifully filmed against a absolutely gorgeous scenery and well acted. I knew that The Sound of Music was only loosely based on the Von Trapp family and it was fun to see this retelling of their story based on the book by the eldest Von Trapp daughter.

7616504,5,B01B1LE304,"Based on the Memories Before And After The Sound of Music by Agathe von Trapp, we experience a much different view of what the beloved musical version introduced us to in which her name was Liesl. Now recounted from the eldest sibling, Agathe herself, this tells a concise tale in a gravely changing political climate and a more urgent aspect that manages to add the warmer familial traits we have come to know as far as her life story  from younger (Eliza Bennett) to her much older years (Rosemary Harris). The film begins in the present day with the elder Agathe having a heart-to-heart talk with her very unhappy niece, Kirsty (Lauryn Canny). She begins a narrative of her life since Kirsty cannot believe she would be able to relate to how she feels whatsoever with their age gap. We go back to when Agathe was a younger child and watch her grow and fall in love with Sigi (Johannes Nussbaum) as WWII begins to heavily cloud over Austria. Naval Captain Georg von Trapp (Matthew Macfadyen) is now married to Maria (Yvonne Catterfeld) and you may get quite a different impression of Maria here in this film as she has a definite strong backbone and an unshakable resolve, but always her kindness.

I was impressed with the realism of this cast of characters coming from Memories, or a Memoir, as Agathe feels completely replaced as the caregiver of the family von Trapp. Can this be how the elder Aunt can relate to her niece? Among other things, Agathe tells Kirsty; Its hard to see the picture when you're standing so close. She speaks of regretting her bitterness towards Maria for quite a while. Now these two could come together in Austria to arrange a plan; one of a quite different sort involving the famous soprano soloist, Lotte Lehmann (Annette Dasch) and a new possibility as Hitler is now in short sight. Even though we do understand some of the stories from the musical this is a much more personal account. It is happy, complicated at times, and then has the 'certain immediacy about the politically dire tone from one womans viewpoint.

We are treated to intricate songs (Enis Rotthoff along with choir supervisor Wolfgang Gotz) the way they were precisely sung; melodic, harmoniously, and astoundingly beautiful. This interesting screenplay (Christoph Silber and Tim Sullivan along with a creative consultant) is abridged for the specific purpose of blending these distinct times cohesively and directed by Ben Verbong to give a completely alternative view of the authentic Agathe and the growth of her family over time. The von Trapps are mainly filmed (Jan Fehse) gorgeously in Salzburg, Austria and Bavaria, Germany along with some back and forth views in Montana. With absolute informative and a pull no punches realism, we understand the point of view of this film beginning quickly with a young Agathe and her sisters and brothers (seven altogether) then. Another feel good film to add to your watch list especially for the sentimentally inclined",1464566400,22,2971,4.879207920792079

The quality of this movie was a Hallmark Channel made for TV movie.  The screen wrtiting was terrible.  I imagine the story - based on Agathe's memoir - would be compelling.  But the actual dialogue and the acting was so cheesy.  I probably would have enjoyed it more if it were on TV for free.  But definitely not worth $13.00.

It's the story of the Von Trapp family as told from a daughter's perspective. She tells the family story to a granddaughter - I think. There are parts of the movie that are difficult to understand. Some of the characters not introduced well, or maybe I just wasn't paying close attention. It was a bit boring. The daughter seems to take all the credit for getting the family involved in music and I wonder if that's true. It was weird seeing Matthew MacFadyen, aka Mr. Darcy as the Captain. I would only recommend watching to hard-core Von Trapp fans.",1526860800,,653,4.637931034482759
