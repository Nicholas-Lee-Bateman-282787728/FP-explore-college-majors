8535545,5,B00943OUDM,"The entire card was filled with awesome fast paced matches, but if you're not one for such a category then you might be feeling a little burned out. The main event ladder match is a must see, even if you're not a casual wrestling fan. Though it's a bunch of Indy dudes, the ladder match is up there with WWE's TLC match at WrestleMania 17.

1. Joey Ryan vs. Famous B **1/2
2. Roderick Strong vs. TJ Perkins ***1/2
3. The RockNES Monsters vs. The Fightin' Taylor Boys **1/4

8535546,5,B00943OUDM,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood with this event celebrating their ninth anniversary.

The P.W.G. Tag Team Championship was on the line in a triple threat ladder match with the Super Smash Brothers defending against Young Bucks & Future Shock in a match that had so many highlights such as one man knocked off the apron into the fourth row, tables & chairs being used as weapons along with the fans themselves, Nick Jackson taking the greatest fall off a ladder I've ever seen in my life, everyone taking physical punishment with the ladder including the referee who ended up getting busted open, a double stomp & brainbuster onto open chairs, and all the competitors flying all over the place both in & out of the ring.  Other matches include Kevin Steen defending the P.W.G. Championship against Willie Mack in a match that started off aggressive with brawling on the floor & didn't let up with moves like Willie's moonsault & Steen's F5 onto the referee, RockNES Monsters vs. Fightin' Taylor Boys that had so many entertaining moments such as female fan at ringside getting beer poured on her & a beard back rake from Johnny Goodtime while also seeing a Razor's Edge over the top rope, Sami Callihan vs. Michael Elgin in an intense battle, Drake Younger's debut against B-Boy in a stiff brawl, Brian Cage vs. Eddie Edwards in a hard hitting match, a ""speed vs. power"" match in T.J. Perkins vs. Roderick Strong, and Joey Ryan vs. Famous B.

This was without a doubt one of the strongest events I've seen from P.W.G. with that ladder match going down one as one of the greatest I've seen in history so get this event, no questions asked.",1377734400,,1942,4.8258258258258255
8535547,4,B00943OUDM,"the triple threat ladder match is one of the craziest things i've ever seen! all three teams did phenomenal in this one. the Young Bucks show why they're the best tag team on the planet right now. every match on here is pretty good. Roderick Strong vs TJ Perkins is my second favorite of the event. just fantastic mat work and transitions. both are severely under-rated! B-Boy vs Drake Younger is another match that took it to another level. the crowd reactions were great in this one, as expected with PWG crowds! over-all, a very strong show and one i'd recommend to any real wrestling fan!",1377648000,2,592,4.59433962264151
8535548,5,B00943OUDM,"While the whole card on this DVD which was the 9th Anniversary show of Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, but the one main match i wanted to see was the main event for the tag team titles, as Future Shock (Adam Cole and Kyle O'Reilly) vs The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) vs the Super Smash Brothers(c) (Player Uno and Stupidfy) in what i personally say is the match of 2012. From crazy ass bumps, to hitting the ref with a ladder, to a crazy ass finish this match made me buy the dvd, and you should too.",1365897600,,501,4.175257731958763
