2747180,5,B000MTEFX2,"This is one of my favorite Cagney movies.  Then again, Cagney was my favorite actor of all-time, so there are quite a number of ""favorites"".  I won't go into describing the movie because someone else has already done an excellent job of that.  Cagney and Sheridan were paired up in several movies, most notably, Torrid Zone, Angels With Dirty Faces (my favorite Cagney film) and City For Conquest (another favorite).  He was paired up with Pat O'Brien even more.  O'Brien was also in Angels...

Of course, it helps that Cagney and O'Brien were real life best friends.  They sort of had a kind of fraternity among Irish actors, which also included Spencer Tracy and Frank McHugh (who was in a ton of Cagney movies).

At any rate, this is a first rate movie which old movie buffs will love.  It's Cagney at his best, Sheridan at her sexiest and good supporting acting from O'Brien and George Tobias.",1174694400,11,897,4.662420382165605
2747181,5,B000MTEFX2,"Warner Brothers was always a studio which did not hesitate to copy the output of others. This hilarious film, made in 1940, is a cocktail of ""The Front Page"", ""Red Dust"", ""Only Angels have Wings"" and others with a showcase role for the very special Ann Sheridan who had been nicknamed ""The Oomph Girl"" after a major publicity build up in 1939.

The film is set on a banana plantation run by Pat O'Brien who employs James Cagney to help get the crop out on time. Cagney is playing around with the manager's wife, Helen Vinson, and Sheridan arrives, falls for Cagney and the fur flies as the wife and Sheridan spar. There is a subplot with bandits and George Tobias is very funny as their leader.

Cagney sports an absurd moustache and the rapid dialogue between him and O'Brien is excellent. This must be one of the few times when Cagney had a film stolen from him for Sheridan wears one immaculate outfit, tosses off wisecracks particularly towards Vinson and never loses her cool in the heat. This is a first rate comedy performance, even if the circumstances are cliched. She sings a song too in a bar in her usual irresistable flirty style - not a great contralto voice but great delivery. This woman was seriously attractive. It is obvious that no-one was taking the film seriously and the leads were having a ball. Outtakes on a blooper reel from another Warner's DVD verify this.

The print of the film is excellent preserving the crisp black and white photography. The film was produced by Hall Wallis so the production values are very good. The DVD includes ""Warner's Night at the Movies"" with short film, cartoon etc which add considerable enjoyment to the package. Don't miss this forgotten treasure.",1171065600,24,1710,4.693333333333333

2747197,1,B000MTEFX2,"The order was received promptly, packaged well, and, seemingly, unveiwed. Unfortunately, the DVD is defective. First, none of the special features can be viewed. Secondly, the movie itself cannot be viewed beyond the first forty minutes or so and no amount of disc cleaning will enable me to watch the balance of the movie or any of the special features. I'd like to replace this with a disc that works as the manufacturer intended. Can this be done? If so, how?

2747198,4,B000MTEFX2,I enjoy all of James Cagney movies and I have collected or purchased them all.  But this one receives four stars instead of the five stars that I give most of my reviews because it was not as wonderful as most of the Cagney movies.,1420761600,,231,4.133333333333334

2747200,5,B000MTEFX2,"Can't get much better than Cagney, O'Brien, and Ann Sheridan.  Fast talking and sassy dialogue, O'Brien bluster, Cagney with a sexy mustache, and Ms Sheridan singing a musical number.  Funny character actors in supporting roles too.

2747204,3,B000MTEFX2,"I purchased this DVD largely-based on the effusive reviews here at Amazon.  However, despite being a real fan of James Cagney and pleased with all the actors in the film, I must agree with the other 3-star reviewer that this is really a sub-par comedy and Cagney film.  It's really a pity, as I was looking forward to seeing Cagney in another comedy -- a rare vehicle for that amazing actor.

The story drags, especially the first 20-minutes (of just 88) before Cagney makes his appearance.  He and Ann Sheridan have some real chemistry and some amusing exchanges, but that can't compensate for a very slim story that really doesn't make a lot of sense.  The motivations and reactions of the characters are frequently illogical, even for a supposed comedy.

If you're very curious about the movie, it's certainly inexpensive and generously endowed with mediocre special features.  Otherwise, I recommend ""One, Two, Three"" as much better Cagney comedy and any of his gangster pictures as superior stories.

Again, I wish I could love this movie -- I really wanted to -- but far from being a ""Torrid Zone"" it's a lukewarm bath.",1376611200,,1125,4.822916666666667
2747243,4,B000MTEFX2,"Lotsa fun.  The three stars, Cagney, Sheridan and O'Brien, really shine.  And the price; can't miss.  Great start to finish!!

2747246,5,B000MTEFX2,"I never knew Jimmy Cagney made this forgotten gem, very rare to see it on the TV.  I was lounging channel surfing one day when Turner TV played this on their channel. The movie opens with old reliable  quick talking Pat O'brien directing traffic in what seemed a mundane old movie and it isn't until Jimmy comes into the scene after about 10 minutes when this movie really opens up. Cagney was such a great actor that the movie really kicked into another gear with just his presence.  You will not be disappointed if you are a fan of the golden days of movie stars and movies themselves.",1363564800,2,587,4.416666666666667
2747247,5,B000MTEFX2,classic movie set in the guatemalan jungle.  great acting with cagney sheridan and o'brien. good comic relief with classic storyline,1356134400,,132,5.6
2747248,4,B000MTEFX2,"Arguably one of James Cagney's most unusual assignments at Warner Bros., TORRID ZONE (1940) gave the actor the chance to break away from his gangster personality, and also reunited him with close friend Pat O'Brien, and frequent leading lady Ann Sheridan.  The end result is one of the most enjoyable films in Cagney's Warner catalogue; a fun, screwbally variation on ""Red Dust"", that earlier MGM romantic melodrama with Gable, Harlow and Astor duking it out on an exotic rubber plantation.

In TORRID ZONE, James Cagney (sporting a pencil moustache) plays Nick Butler, the former overseer of an embattled Mexican banana plantation, now on his way to Chicago and greener pastures.  But Banana Company exec Steve Case (Pat O'Brien) knows that Nick is the plantation's secret weapon in keeping everything running smoothly.  He convinces Nicky to remain for an additional two weeks.  The only trouble is the arrival of Lee Donley (Ann Sheridan), a nightclub singer and cardshark sick of ""starving"" in the United States, and wanting to test her luck south of the border.  Steve tries to keep the pair apart but Lee delights in remaining two steps ahead.  Toss in a group of renegade Mexican bandits and the spurned wife of the plantation's manager, and you have the recipe for a fantastic night of entertainment.

James Cagney and Ann Sheridan pair here as memorably as they did in their first film together (""Angels With Dirty Faces""); and would be reunited again in 1940 for the gangster drama ""City for Conquest"".  TORRID ZONE is a particularly delightful vehicle for the pair, as they toss around the sparkling screenplay written by Richard Macaulay and Jerry Wald.  Andy Devine, Helen Vinson, Jerome Cowan, George Tobias, Victor Kilian and George Reeves co-star.

The DVD comes equipped with another Warner Night at the Movies programme, which includes the Technicolor short ""Pony Express Days"" (with George Reeves), ""Ozzie Nelson and His Orchestra"", the Oscar-nominated Merrie Melodies cartoon ""A Wild Hare""; and the trailers for both TORRID ZONE and ""Santa Fe Trail"".",1297987200,2,2070,5.130952380952381
2747249,3,B000MTEFX2,"I actually watched this movie based on the positive reviews on this site, so feel compelled to provide some balance.  In my humble opinion, its value is reflected in the price it's going for - $4.50 new.  If it were truly bad, people would buy it to make fun of it.  It's just...off.  Unlike other reviewers, I found only one line -- the last one of the movie -- briefly memorable and funny.  (Now you'll have to watch it too, in its entirety.)  Otherwise, I wish I'd made better use of my time.  If you want to see a hilarious movie about a female card sharp, it's obvious ""The Lady Eve"" is your choice.  If you want to see better Cagney and O'Brien byplay (with better dialogue), there are probably a dozen other movies you can try.  If you like George Tobias, as I do, you'll like him here, even if he's used to portray a stereotype, as is everyone else who portrays a ""native"" in this movie.  I'm no bleeding heart, but in this regard, this lighthearted farce is egregious without being funny about it.  Plot, set, characters and dialogue are all contrived; maybe what's missing is the light touch of the right director to pull it off. Ann Sheridan is alluring, yes, but even she can't put in enough ""oomph"" to sustain this movie.",1282262400,,1234,4.415929203539823
2747250,4,B000MTEFX2,I enjoyed the heck out of this wonderful classic! I laughed till I cried at some of the lines in this beautiful movie! 4 out of 5 stars!!!,1258502400,,138,3.9642857142857144
2747251,4,B000MTEFX2,"Torrid Zone pretty much IS The Front Page with a smattering of Red Dust for added flavor, with Pat O'Brien (who played Walter Burns in the original Broadway production and Hildy Johnson in the 1931 film of the newspaper classic) the unscrupulous banana exporter trying to trick Jimmy Cagney's plantation manager back into his old job in a corrupt South American hellhole, with Ann Sheridan's singer-cum-card-sharp providing the romantic sparks and George Tobias' loveable revolutionary making things difficult at the workplace. Familiarity rather than originality is on the menu, but it's served up with panache and pace and the best production values Warner Bros. can offer. Helen Vinson doesn't exactly offer much competition for Sheridan, Andy Devine provides the comic relief, Jerome Cowan, Bogart's ill-fated partner in The Maltese Falcon, is still having wife troubles as Cagney's intended replacement and TV's original ill-fated Superman, George Reeves, turns up as a treacherous plantation worker. The biggest surprise is the year of production - despite having a classic mid-Thirties look, it was actually made in 1940, although that's probably more of a plus than a minus.

George Reeves also turns up in the color two-reeler 'Pony Express Days' as Buffalo Bill, part of another goodselection of Warner Bros. Night at the Movies short subjects that also includes Bugs Bunny cartoon 'A Wild Hare,' and trailers for Santa Fe Trail and Torrid Zone itself. Warners' DVD also boasts an excellent transfer.",1182038400,,1510,5.34453781512605
2747252,5,B000MTEFX2,"Torrid Zone, starring James Cagney, Ann Sheridan and Pat O'Brien, is a movie from 1940, that is full of humor, adventure, action and great characters.  Everybody in the movie is perfect for their parts, the timing of the jokes and lines are right on target and the ending makes you feel good.  This is the eighth movie that Cagney and O'Brien teamed up for and it shows.  They really know how to work together.

Cagney plays a banana plantation foreman who wants to get out of the business but is offered a large amount of cash if he will stay just a little loner.  The plantation is having troubles and Steve Case, played by O'Brien, needs help fast.  Add Lee Donley, played by Sheridan, who is both singer and card shark and you have a hot, funny, film just begging to be watched again and again.

The DVD is also great.  It has, as extras, a vintage newsreel, a musical short, a historical short about the Pony Express Days, the first Bugs Bunny cartoon and some trailers.  You can play them all, giving you the feeling of being in a movie theater in the 1940s.  Just dim the lights and get some pop corn.  Enjoy!",1181260800,10,1116,4.3951219512195125
8171818,3,B000MTEFX2,"Torrid Zone, 1940 film

The Torrid Zone lies along the equator. A man walks into a bar where a woman sings. She just arrived from the states. Case orders her fired! He is the General Manager of the Banana Company, his word is the law. She plays at the card table and wins, but she is still ordered out of the country. There is a problem is shipping by railroad. Case orders the immediate shooting of Rosario, an accused revolutionist. But something goes wrong! Case is upset over this. Miss Lee Donley is placed on the ship, and meets Nick Butler. Nick talks to Case, they discuss Mrs. Anderson. Case hires Nick for two weeks. But there is a trick here. That girl escaped from the boat, Nick gives her shelter. They gamble on cards, she wins.

Lee hitches a ride to Plantation No. 7. There is a shortage of workers, some men went to join Rosario to get their land back. Rosarios men raided the stores for guns and ammunition. A reward is offered for information. Nick orders Lee to leave for the states. The train halts because of damaged tracks. Nick plans to go after Rosario (you can see his character). They attack from behind, there is shooting. Rosario is captured. Nicks wound is treated. Lee visits Rosario in the storeroom. Case arrives and wakes up Nick, who decides to leave for Chicago. Nick says goodbye to Lee. Rosario turns up with pistols, but the tables are turned. Rosario escapes. Case manipulates people again. Will there be a happy ending for Nick and Lee?

This is an unusual story, half romantic conflicts and half political intrigue. The Banana Company must have stolen land from people and turned them into dependent workers. That is why many supported Rosario. The conflict between Nick and Case echoes The Front Page.",1515196800,,1744,4.6375404530744335
