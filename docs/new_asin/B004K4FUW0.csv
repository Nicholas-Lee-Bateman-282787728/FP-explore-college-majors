4392233,5,B004K4FUW0,"For those of you that have followed UFC from the start like I have, this set is MUST have. Royce is the guy who started it all, and even if you just started watching UFC this is a good way to see how the UFC got started. I don't wanna spoil it too much but it's definitely is worth having.",1304985600,4,289,3.8333333333333335
4392234,3,B004K4FUW0,"""UFC: Ultimate Royce Cracie"" focuses on the man who pioneered the Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Gracie is the son of legendary Hello Gracie, a giant in the world of Brazilian jiu jitsu.  By age 17, Royce had a blue belt in Gracie jiu jitsu.  He later moved to the United States and received his black belt in the sport.  In 1993, Royce's brother Rorion devised the UFC, which would put fighters of various martial arts together to see who came out on top.

This two-disc Blu-ray collection showcases the jiu jitsu master at his best with close to six hours of content, including interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and -- best of all -- his classic fights against Ken Shamrock, Kimo Leopoldo and Kazushi Sakuraba.",1304985600,,718,4.852459016393443

4392260,4,B004K4FUW0,"Awesome doc! I can't believe even all his NHB/MMA fights are here! I only have a problem with the packaging for this set. I feel that every time I take the discs out, they get more damaged or get more scratches.",1360540800,3,211,4.170731707317073
4392261,4,B004K4FUW0,"The product came quickly, the dvd only skips through about  1 minute of footage, so it made it a great deal for the price i paid !!!!!",1360022400,,134,3.962962962962963
4392262,5,B004K4FUW0,definitely a must have for any ufc fan and mma fan in general and will not regret buyingthis blu-ray !!!,1359158400,2,104,4.25
4392263,4,B004K4FUW0,"So this is a true ultimate Gracie collection of our man Royce.  Great interviews, all fight scenese, BUT there is a production problem with the Shamrock fight in the last 3 or so minutes.  I even returned this one and got a brand new one same problem.  Tried playing it on several different players, same problem.  You'd think someone would preview the ENTIRE product before MASS Dissemination.  So I knocked off a star b/c of this.  Sigh...even knowing this I'd still buy it.",1353888000,2,476,4.674698795180723
4392264,5,B004K4FUW0,"Really an excelent DVD! The only things I would add are: the first fight against Yoshida, the fight against Akebono and the second fight against Sakuraba.",1348358400,,154,4.961538461538462
4392265,5,B004K4FUW0,This is a great buy for the ultimate UFC fan. My husband loves UFC and got me watching it. I never understood a lot of the backround story but after watching this it really gives you the info you want. Royce Gracie was one of the first and the best. It is a must buy!,1331856000,,267,3.8727272727272726
4392266,5,B004K4FUW0,"For generations upon generations, sporting enthusiasts have debated the eternal question of: ""Who could beat who in a fight?""  Would it be the boxer, kickboxer, karate champion, strongman, or even sumo wrestler?  In the early 1990s, the Ultimate Fighting Championship set out to answer that formidable question.  With the addition of one Royce Gracie to that tournament, they had their answer: Brazilian Ju-Jitsu ruled supreme.

In the main documentary portion of this film, the life of the youngest Gracie brother is succinctly chronicled.  From his family legacy (which ultimately birthed UFC) to his younger years spent in training to his MMA dominance and even his passing of the torch, the documentary covers all the main portions of Royce's life and is extremely interesting for fight fans.

Also included in this set are all of Royce's UFC bouts (including the latest foray against Matt Hughes) as well as some ""bonus"" fights in Japan's PRIDE league.  For UFC fans who remember those ""early years"", those UFC 1-5 matches will bring back a wave of nostalgia.

Perhaps the most interesting theme of this whole set, however, is the ""contradiction in terms"" that Royce was to the UFC.  On one hand, his family almost single-handedly created the sport and defined its submission-style fighting that is still widely in use today.  On the other hand, however, Royce's pure style (staying in the guard position waiting for a mistake to capitalize in) actually ushered in a system of rounds and stand-up rules to the UFC, as the rowdier-than-the-most-of-us fans of the sport did not appreciate the ""ground & pound"" fights.

Simply put, if you remember (or especially were a fan of) Royce Gracie or the early UFC whatsoever (or are just looking for a history lesson), this is a must-own collection.  You really won't need to own anything else of the kind.",1325289600,5,1852,5.016339869281046
4392267,5,B004K4FUW0,"First off I'm a HUGE fan of the UFC have been since I was a kid and Royce Gracie was the first fighter I was in awe of. I was shocked at how a relatively slender man, only 176lbs, could destroy his competition! Men who looked twice his size and with patience and skill he dispatched them one by one including Ken Shamrock, Kimo, Keith Hackney, Pat Smith, and Dan Severn. It's because of this man and his family that the UFC even exsists today and it's great to hear from him about each of his fights, his mindset, and what it meant to represnt his Family's Legacy!

This Blu-Ray set is loaded with extras, not to mention most of his fight including his Pride FC fights! Definitely brought back fond memories of when I watched it on VHS. It's also packaged as a Digibook and has many colorful pages, photos, and facts about Royce. If you're a fan of the UFC I can't see how you can't love this Blu-Ray!",1315872000,3,901,4.269005847953216
4392268,4,B004K4FUW0,"Just got the Ultimate Gracie Blu Ray and watched both discs through. Ultimate Gracie is the same doc that was aired on Spike TV and if you missed it, it was one of their best docs the UFC has done on a fighter. From Royce's childhood all the way to about present day is told about the first UFC legend plus fighters that fought Royce talk about being submitted by things they never knew existed and present day UFC fighters talk about the first time they saw Royce fight and instantly wanted to train jiu jitsu.  The only thing I was disappointed in and gave it 4 stars was there was not enough extra features that I thought were going to be there like the advertisement said( I guess all the behind the scenes and interviews are just in the doc). The extras included are Royce's induction to the UFC Hall of Fame and just about all of Royce's fights in the UFC and in PrideFC, which is nice but the hardcore MMA fan probably already own most of the UFC and Pride DVD's. All in all I do suggest this to any Royce fan or MMA/UFC fan to see where it all started.",1305590400,9,1060,4.196078431372549

8432182,1,B004K4FUW0,"This 1 star is only for my disappointment in the product. Royce Gracie is one of my childhood idols. This 1 star is not for him. I ordered this the first time and disc 1 did not work at all. Disc 2 worked well. I called Amazon. They sent me a replacement free of charge. Once again disc 2 is fine. Disc 1 was once again the problem. This time some of it actually worked, but only 3 or 4 of the bonus fights work. At the end of the fights it freezes. The main story of his life doesn't work when I select it. I am so disappointed. I urge you to put aside your appreciation for Royce Gracie for a second and not buy this product. Buy it at your own risk.",1468972800,,652,3.873134328358209
8432183,4,B004K4FUW0,Great all around DVD just one problem: chapter 1 gets stuck. I returned it and they sent me another bad copy again with the same problem! I just skip to chapter 2 now.,1464912000,,167,4.090909090909091
