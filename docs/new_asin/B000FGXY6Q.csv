8122461,1,B000FGXY6Q,"These videos (the UTD openwater and UTD 5-DX essentials of recreational diving (Yeah, really sorry I rented 2 at the same time- live and learn), are just video of a guy floating at the bottom of the ocean, loosely demonstrating maneuvers. There is absolutely no helpful narration whatsoever to let you know the intricacies of what he is doing and why and how various different maneuvers will help in different situations, etc. There is virtually nothing of substance or help here. Occasionally a pause with some cryptic 2-3 word subtitles is the most you'll get. Chances are if you're an advanced enough diver to figure out what is going on, you don't need it. Both videos are also punctuated with an awful soundtrack that loops about every 30 seconds and NEVER stops. If you must watch to find out for yourself, do yourself a favor and put it on mute. You won't miss a word. There are none.

Note: I think the better reviews must be those that know the makers or are the makers themselves. The man's name was never mentioned in the video - it has no opening or closing credits nor is mentioned in the description or specs. So really the only way to know it is to know who made it. Or have some amazing psychic ability.",1348963200,,1219,4.515837104072398
8122462,3,B000FGXY6Q,"This dvd is excellent if used for what it is intended, Support material for a DIR class. Although it demonstrates amazing dive technique and gives a good idea of valuable skils, the only way it would be effective is whith direction from an instructor and the other material that belongs with it.

If you are looking at getting this DVD here  and are not taking a DIR course then look at getting either of the next two DVDs from 5thD-X.

For example Intro to technical diving has all the same skills plus a few  more and actually breaks them down a little better.

Good dvd in context.",1175558400,2,584,4.420560747663552
8122463,5,B000FGXY6Q,"Remember all the skills you were taught in your Beginning Open Water class?  Well, forget them.  THIS is the way that you should be diving.  While the large agencies are content to turn out McDivers, once you're ready to progress to a level where diving becomes relatively effortless and truly fun ... you've come to the right place.  Thanks, Andrew!",1162425600,,350,4.783333333333333
