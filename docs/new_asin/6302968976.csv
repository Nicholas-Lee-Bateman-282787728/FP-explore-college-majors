With cartoons these days leaving many disgusted and alarmed at the stuff in them, this is a great way to remember back when cartoons were good and clean fun! If you like motorcycles and action, then check out this series!

Rock and Ride, everyone!",1440806400,,410,4.256410256410256

7832702,5,6302968976,"I loved BMFM as a kid and still love it now. If you haven't watched it I'd say give it a chance, maybe it wasn't as big as TMNT but is was just as good, and the jokes the mice or maybe I should say Modo made about the turtles and Chipmunks in these episodes are hilarious.",1381017600,,272,3.789473684210526
7832703,3,6302968976,I am a huge fan of the series and own the other VHS tapes. I had a hard time watching this one. It seemed that I could not stay awake. I attempted to watch it two times (on different days) and both times I fell asleep. I watched it a third time and actually managed to stay awake (only barely).,1320883200,,294,3.9166666666666665
