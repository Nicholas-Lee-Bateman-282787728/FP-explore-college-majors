8088848,5,B000BMCY4M,"The title is appropriate for the content presented in this DVD.  Having never studied massage techniques nor recieved such massage treatment, I found the explainations and camera angels to be informative.  But read other reviews, because I don't havin any means of comparision!

The therapist goes through different techniques and demonstrates them dispite his own preferences.  The most interesting part for me was the anatomuy of the foot and how it directly relates to the rest of the body.  I'd recomend this video to anyone who interested, but might not be as useful for advanced therapists or professionals.",1169164800,16,613,5.214285714285714
