8423726,5,B00000F78P,"This recording contains a spoken introduction by Yehudi Menuhin, which should be required listening for all musicians and anyone else who is one a spiritual quest. He eloquently connects music making and prayer in a way that makes very clear why so many say that Menuhin's playing ""comes from another world."" Cast aside your Bibles, and listen instead to Menuhin play. This performance of the Brahms is a revelation. My only qualification is that the violin part is under-miked, with the result that the performance lacks the overwhelming power of the one with one with Rudolph Kempe, but don't miss the spoken introduction of this VHS recording.",1213747200,,646,5.046728971962617
