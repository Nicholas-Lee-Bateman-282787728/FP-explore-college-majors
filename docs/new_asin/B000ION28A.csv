2661210,5,B000ION28A,"This is a great set for any serious Dragonball Z fan, as it contains the first three movie releases: Dead Zone, World's Strongest, and Tree of Might. These movies take place outside of the main series, so it's important to note that the events that take place in them are assumed not to have happened during the main storyline (with the major exception of the first movie with Garlic Jr. which actually creates a major plothole). Another thing worth mention is that although this set was technically available before, the movies featured in the previous release were from the ""old"" Dragonball Z dub, which contains the voice actors for the first two edited seasons. If you enjoyed the Pioneer releases better, then by all means, go obtain the other set as they are also uncut and feature the original music. I personally recommend this set however, especially if you enjoy the FUNimation voice cast and also if you want to watch the movies in Japanese. As for the movies themselves, this is what I thought of each one:

Dead Zone - 4/5 - This one features the villain Garlic Jr. as he begins his conquest for the Dragonballs in order to obtain immortality. In the process of finding the Dragonballs, he also captures Gohan (Goku's son) and holds him captive in his castle. Now it is Goku's job to rescue Gohan and the Dragonballs in order to keep Garlic Jr. from taking over the Earth.

This is the first Dragonball Z movie ever released, and I must say, it was quite entertaining. In comparison to the rest of the movies, it doesn't feature as many energy blasts as the rest of them, save maybe a Kamehameha or two. Much of the focus is placed on the characters dueling with their fists and weapons (can we say Power Pole?) The story takes place around the same time as the arrival of Raditz, so Goku and Piccolo are still enemies during this movie and Gohan's hidden powers are still... well... hidden. I watched Pioneer's version prior to viewing this one, and although the voice acting was acceptable enough for me, I was disappointed that they changed the music. Especially during the scene where Gohan gets ""drunk"" and starts having hallucinations. If you check out the Japanese version, you will know exactly what I mean. But other than that, this is a solid movie and a must see for any DBZ fan.

The World's Strongest - 4/5 - The mad scientist Dr. Wheelo has been revived by the Dragonballs and now seeks to find the world's strongest fighter in which to place his brain in. Since he has been frozen in solid ice for 50 years, he believes that Master Roshi is still the strongest, and sends his minions out to capture him as well as Bulma. It's up to Goku, Gohan, and Krillin to save the day as they face Dr. Wheelo in his ice fortress.

The villain in this movie is not very memorable, considering all he is is a giant brain. However, I still found the overall movie very entertaining, especially since we get to see another throwdown between Goku and Piccolo. The various fight scenes featured in this film are very well done, and show off some of the abilities learned by Goku during the course of the Saiyan saga. We also get to see Master Roshi fight a few battles, which is something that hasn't really been showcased since Dragonball. The only nagging problem I saw with this movie is the music that FUNimation used to substitute for the Japanese original. You'll understand what I mean immediately when you hear it, but you'll feel like you're watching a sci-fi horror film rather than an action anime. Definately worth watching though if you care about DBZ.

Tree of Might - 4/5 - Turles, a Saiyan with a craving for power, has arrived on Earth and brought his henchmen with him. He plants a seed in the depths of the earth that creates a Tree of Might, which drains the Earth of its power and converts it into large fruit. Anyone who eats this fruit will have power that will rival that of gods. Now it's up to the Z Fighters to put a stop to Turles and his Tree of Might.

I thought this was one of the better Dragonball Z movies to be released. It features a larger selection of the show's characters than most, and the main villain, Turles, is much more likeable than say Garlic Jr. or Dr. Wheelo. This movie also introduces a character that is used in future DBZ movies and filler: Gohan's loveable dragon friend, Icarus. The music that FUNimation decided to use in this movie is much less distracting than some of their other releases, and the dubbing seemed to be on par with the rest of the series. The story is also very well paced, being careful to build up to a climax without jumping headfirst into it. Out of the initial DBZ movies, this one is the best.

Overall, this is a great deal for the first three Dragonball Z movies. The entire set is about $30, so that's like paying $10 for each movie individually, plus you get a nice collector's box to place them all in. Each movie is enjoyable in its own way and something no DBZ fan should go without.",1184284800,3,4982,4.504424778761062
2661211,5,B000ION28A,"I recently retook a reminiscent fanatacism to Dragonball Z, and this box set was a great and easy way to know some items off my list for having a collection. The movies are good (Patricularly 'The World's Strongest') and the production vaule was way better than I was expecting (It's a surprisingly nice box, not made of cheap thin cardboard). All in all I would say tis is a great item to buy, and Amazon got it to me quickly, and it works perfectly!",1178928000,,451,4.380952380952381
2661212,5,B000ION28A,"In this DragonBall Z Movie Box Set you get the first three DBZ movies, the Dead Zone, The World's Strongest, and The Tree of Might for a great price. The movies themselves are great and have interesting stories, but they do lack some of DBZ's best characters such as Vegeta.

In the Dead Zone, Goku and Piccolo must stop Garlic Jr., a monster who has immortality on his side. Gohan may need to help out to win this one...

The World's Strongest involves a mad scientist trying to steal Goku's body so he can rule the world. This movie contains very interesting fight scenes as do all of them. The Tree of Might threatens to suck the life out of Earth unless our heros stop it in the third movie. They'll have to defeat Turles, a saiyan, to do it though.

All three movies are some of the better DBZ movies and are together for a great price. For any fan of DBZ, buying this is a no brainer.",1176854400,,890,4.254437869822485
2661213,4,B000ION28A,"First Let me say that the first Movie ""Return my Gohan/Dead Zone"" contains something I have never experienced from a DBZ movie DVD...A commentary track!  Believe you-me, it is total and complete garbage.  I expected to learn something about Dragonball from the commentary, but instead, I thought that the people watching Dragonball knows more about the series than the American VA's.

On the other hand, the remastering from the original Japanese movies were done well.  I do believe that my uncut-Pioneer dubbed VHS tape of ""Tree of Might"" had much better VA work than the Funi-version.  Tree of Might - Return My Gohan is more watchable in its original form, including the song that Gohan sings after he is drunk (something, something - I love Piccooro!), That was too cute, even so that Clamp could have came up with it and stick it in a Card Captor Sakura OVA.

The other two movies ""Worlds Strongest"" and ""Tree of Might"" are classics.  Before Dragonball Z was an empire, these movies were up there with Project A-ko, Macross, Do you remember love? and Wings of Homenaise.  If you are too young to remember those movies, go find them.  That is what true anime story telling is based on, complex story lines NOT Jiggly girls.

Overall I think the best thing about this set is its value.  You are getting three of the better DBZ movies for a decent price, much better than those AWFUL Cooler movies or Broli movies.",1172707200,,1417,4.696356275303644
2661214,5,B000ION28A,"I like all 3 of these movies.  I've seen all of them prior to the purchase of them.  It's great that they have they in a 3 pack so you don't have to spend $15 on all of them, just $20 on the trio.  I highly recommend this for any dbz fan.  Lets hope they do it for all of the movies.",1168473600,,283,3.5161290322580645

8147013,5,B000ION28A,"This set contains the first 3 theatrical Dragon Ball Z Movies

Movie 1: Dead Zone (Return my Gohan)
Movie 2: The World's Strongest (The World's Strongest Guy)
Movie 3: Tree of Might (A Super Decisive Battle for Earth)

These are the second release of these movies, these versions feature a re-dub of all 3 movies by the funimation in-house dub cast.  However unlike the previous release these dubs have a completely re-done musical score.  So dub fans will be missing out on the original Japanese music.  The 5-pack release by Funimation features the dub with the original Japanese music but then you'll also have to deal with widescreen cropping.

The video quality is okay.  Nowhere near the kind of quality you'd find the Dragon Box releases from Japan.

The audio quality for the English dub is in 5.1 surround sound and sounds good for what it is.  The quality original Japanese mono track leaves something to be desired but not terrible.

If you don't want to deal with the cropping seen on Funimation's more recent releases of the movies this is a good way to get the movies.  Otherwise I recommend the original Pioneer releases of these movies.",1377129600,,1152,4.767676767676767
8147014,5,B000ION28A,"Not sure if this item will always be as cheap as it is now (somethin like $3 to $4), but its an amazing deal for all three of the first Dragonball Z movies and unless it hits $10+, it'll still be a great deal. As with all DBZ movies, the rock/metalish music always adds so much to the fight scenes. Another thing I like about the earlier movies is that everything is a bit more simple than the later ones which seem to be a bunch of infinitely strong Super Saiyans x500 battling one another. This serves to partially alienate many of the earlier characters (Tien, Krillin) because they can't possibly ever get above a certain plateau and be a match for the super saiyans. So if you've never seen any of the movies, don't just buy these because they're the first three, buy em cause' they're arguably the best (in my opinion :p). Also, how can the next bad guy after the next after the next, be sooooooo much stronger than anyone has ever seen? After you reach SS4, there shouldn't be anyone stronger and if there is, what if he had shown up instead of, say Cell? Which leads me to rephrase a prior argument, how can the next bad guy always be stronger than any of the Z Warriors and yet they still manage to beat them each time? Wow I've digressed into critiquing all of the history of DBZ... my apologies. You might find it odd then that DBZ is one of my top 5 favorite shows/animes and these first 3 movies, in my opinion, stick to the core of what DBZ really is; a kickass, pull no punches, take no names, awesome, fighting anime :] After your power level reaches 10 gabizillion trillion billion, things just don't make as much sense (this only happens in the later movies).",1362182400,,1677,4.361022364217252
8147015,5,B000ION28A,This addition to the unfinished ultimate uncut sets in movie format is a great addition comparable in quality to the steelbook releases.,1357084800,,136,5.2272727272727275

8147017,5,B000ION28A,"Seriously, do I need to explain this? It is just awesome. The majesty and awesomeness of this awesome series was a gift from...the japanese!!!!!!!

To be serious, I am a fan so I am quite biased. This is a thrilling adventure of a Saiyan (pronounced SAY-IN) warrior and his friends defending earth, overcoming the near-impossible, and being as corny, hammy and cliche as possible in the process.

It really is an excellent anime series. Altogether watchable much more than once. It is so emotional and passionate in ways that people can recognize. People attack their planet and other planets and they defends their friends and loved ones, yet no one helps whether due to inability or cowardice, this band of friends must pull together to save the universe even, and not just their planet.

Goku, formerly named Kakarot in his original language, is the most pwerful warrior, but there is always someone to challenge him and who wants to dominate the world. Often times, this person is slightly stronger or even many times stronger and through sacrifice, bravery, and friends Goku is able to defeat his enemies.

It is quite hard to explain WHY it is so loved...just see it and you might figure it out. I am horribly picky with the animes I watch and love adn buy, and if I say it is worth buying then chances are you will see at least a couple reasons to hold on to it.",1276214400,,1369,4.621399176954733
8147018,4,B000ION28A,"Before I bought this box set, I had seen or owned all 3 of these movies, but when I learned of the rerecording and such I decided to get them again. I really didn't like the voices in DBZ before Funamation took over them, so I was pretty excited when they decided to go back and rerecord everything before that point. The only problem with this box set is the changing of the original Japanese music. The music they have now is boring, and I like the music they put in the series, you can tell they just wanted to put something in quick. The old English version has it, and the Japanese version, on these box sets, has it, I just don't like watching movies in Japanese. But in the end this is a good deal for all, and these voices are better. I recommend this to any DBZ fan.",1198800000,,775,4.139072847682119
8147019,4,B000ION28A,Though the dvd boxes are not the same as the rest of the moie boxes it is the same ol DragonballZ that we love.  A great set that saves you money with al lthe same enjoyment packed in.,1197417600,,184,3.8421052631578947
8147020,5,B000ION28A,"This is a really great set.  I am probably the only one who is bothered by this though:  The dialogue.  I hate watching the movie in japanese because of Goku's little girl voice, but dislike the dialogue that is in english because it is not as good as what the Japanese version says.  I dunno.  Its just me.  But I Wish the english version just could have stuck with the japanese script instead of changing everything that they say.  But, its just me.  I guess.  FIRST STRIKE ROCKS!!",1189641600,,483,4.3977272727272725
