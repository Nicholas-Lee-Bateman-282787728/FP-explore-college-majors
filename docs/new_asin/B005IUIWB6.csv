Glad to see the dogs (Scout & Violet) rather than frogs all the time. It's a fun & educational DVD, and the songs aren't annoying! :)",1320796800,25,326,4.190476190476191
4710342,5,B005IUIWB6,It was good for the kids,1464134400,,24,3.1666666666666665
4710343,4,B005IUIWB6,"We do enjoy the Leap Frog movie series.  However, I feel that the shows are too addictive for my child.  The next day after viewing one he will throw a tantrum if I suggest doing something else besides watching the Leap Frog movies.  I find this extremely frustrating.  Also, he has watched the series repeatedly and they don't seem to really be helping him to learn his letters, numbers, shapes, etc.  So I've decided to cut him off and just go back to a more hands on approach for learning.  Also, the sound of the characters voices is a little abrasive to me.  They are overly squeaky and it is grating.",1463788800,,606,4.405405405405405

4710367,3,B005IUIWB6,"The movie is pretty fun and has some neat elements to it like a part that showcases vowels and creative way to introduce each letter.  However, WAY too many commercials at beginning to the point of being very annoying.  Also, the music can get obnoxious, they have this theme song that is played one too many times I think, even too much for my kids.",1435190400,,350,4.369230769230769

4710375,5,B005IUIWB6,"Just like all the other LeapFrog movies, my kids love this one, too!  This one has some very different types of animals that are taught.  Instead of just ""Seal"" it was ""Sad Seal""... I think.  They try to put two words out there to help with enforcing the letter so they get some silly ones.  The kids like it because it's different than most of the typical letter shows.",1428019200,,370,4.318840579710145

4710384,3,B005IUIWB6,"I personally think the Scout series is a bit boring compared to the Tad/frog family series. It's hard to have my boy watch them through. The story is repetitive without enough break/refreshing elements, and the selection of words (animals in the phonics farm in this case) could be much better.",1422403200,,294,4.9

You would be giving your little one a great advantage in the learning process by purchasing these DVD's. Their preschool teacher is amazed at how advanced they are in comparison to their classmates.

4710407,2,B005IUIWB6,This is an ok video but the Letter Factory was MUCH better.  I would get that one and not waste your money.  The only thing that was good about this one was it showed the capital and lower case letters not just the capitals like letter factory.,1411084800,2,244,4.170212765957447
4710408,5,B005IUIWB6,"We LOVE this!  My daughter started watching at 1 year, and after a few months she really started singing along and making the letter sounds with e characters.  She loves the vowel song!  I definitely recommend, it's great for introducing kids to talking, learning about letters and the sounds they make.  Definitely my daughters favorite out of all the leap frog videos",1410998400,,369,4.903225806451613

4710410,5,B005IUIWB6,"I have 2 kids, a 1.5-year and a 3-years-old.  I'm not open to the idea of letting them watch TV but my 3-year-old has a classmate who already knows the alphabet and each letter's phonics. The classmate's mother told me it was all due to this DVD. I thought, why not give it a try, so I ordered it and started letting my kids watch it.

My 1.5-year-old is not interested in it at all but my 3-years-old loves watching it again and again.  I think it is the mixture of animals talking and frequently breaking into song that makes this interesting to her.  She doesn't remember all the letters but she is starting to associate each letter with a specific sound.  Most important of all, I feel like she's watching something beneficial.

As for that classmate of my 3-year-old, he is so advanced in his phonics that he is already starting to read.  For example, if I write the words ""purple"", ""red"", and ""yellow"" on a piece of paper, he can guess which word is which, by looking at the first letter of each word and sounding out its phonics.  All due to this DVD.",1410220800,2,1058,4.362244897959184

4710422,5,B005IUIWB6,"I am not normally very excited about the idea of using videos as teaching tools, but this movie, in addition to being the only movie my two-year-old will sit down and watch in its entirety, has really taught my son a lot. It reinforced his knowledge of the alphabet (he knows all of his letters now, at 27 months) -- but it really helped him learn the pronunciation of each letter, which is something other videos have not done. I highly recommend it.",1404000000,,451,4.445783132530121

4710424,5,B005IUIWB6,"My children like this learning video very much.
As another reviewer stated, the storyline is pleasant and the songs are not annoying. But what i like it best for is the way they teach the sounds the letters make, and all about Phonics, in an engaging fashion for a 3 year old and up. Even i enjoy hearing it on in the background or sitting down to watch it with them.
It doesn't go too fast either, which was another plus for me.",1402358400,,429,4.180722891566265
4710425,3,B005IUIWB6,"While I may not love this DVD as much as I love Letter Factory, my 26 month old does and asks to watch it several times a day. I don't feel that it matches up to Letter Factory in its repetition of letter sounds or musical content of either Letter Factory or Numberland- another one he really likes. This DVD mainly features one scenario for the entire length of the program- the friends being introduced to animals according to the letters in the alphabet. It's pretty boring to me but then again, I'm not the target audience and like I said, our son likes it a lot. I just wish it matched up to the other DVDs in it's educational value.",1401062400,,638,4.2809917355371905
4710426,4,B005IUIWB6,"If you're looking for videos to teach your child the letter names and sound, get The Letter Factory and the Talking Word Factory. Much better for that. However, this is a great companion video that reinforces concepts in a fun way. My two-year-old really enjoys it. My only drawback is the previews that go on and on and on and on and on. They didn't have any previews in the first Leapfrog videos I bought and these previews make it really hard to get to the main movie in the car where my daughter watches these. It is sooo annoying to me that I'm tempted to give it only one star. Really.",1401062400,,591,4.285714285714286

4710433,4,B005IUIWB6,"I have written a few reviews related to the Leap Frog videos out there. I have yet to come across one that I didn't like - this one included. I feel that Leap Frog does an excellent job putting these videos together. They seem to genuinely care about finding the best way to teach young children different lessons.

That being said, I still think Letter Factory is the best one, followed by Words Factory. They just seem to really click with my son.

Phonics Farm is very similar in terms of the lesson being taught when compared to Letter Factory, but Phonics farm doesn't do as good of a job in my opinion. Both videos are aimed at teach children their letter sounds. The one advantage that Phonics farm does have is that it acknowledges both the short and long vowel sounds. There is also an actually point made about vowels which was nice.

All that being said, you probably won't be disappointed with many of the Leap Frog purchases. My son genuinely learns from them and enjoys them as well.",1392768000,,997,4.497237569060774

I'm a stay at home mom and my daughter, who turned 4 in August, is able to use phonics to sound out words.

Leapfrog: Phonics Farm has catchy songs, bright colorful characters, and a plot.... that are devoid of learning material.  And some bits about phonics thrown in there for the parents.  When me and my son finished watching this one, my son kept humming the theme song (about the leapfrog branded characters) and couldn't remember anything about actual letters.

On the other hand, after we watched Leapfrog: Letter Factory, my son couldn't stop quoting, ""Is this the 'E' room""? to me.  (Appropriate response: Ehhh??"".

In short, if you're looking for a Leapfrog DVD about phonics, get the Letter Factory and leave this one alone.  Where the Letter Factory is about teaching letters, this DVD is about getting kids hooked on Leapfrog DVDs.

Penny's voice is kinda annoying, I wish they didn't automatically use high pitched voices for kids. But that doesn't affect my review. She loves it, it's educational, and has great songs!!

4710475,4,B005IUIWB6,"We are a Leap Frog family. We don't watch much TV- just the occasional DVD and when my kids were 2 and 3, just educational videos. We LOVE the Leap Frog ""Letter Factory"" DVD series (different than this series) and I encourage you all to check it out.  Letter Factory is the PERFECT starting phonics video for kids at age 2 1/2-4 who do not know their letters yet.  My 8 year old still thinks it's fun to watch with his brother. Letter Factory introduces all 26 letters in Capitals only (important- not too much information to confuse at first) and only the single, short sound.  Little kids don't immediately need to recognize lower case or that the letter ""E"" may sound like ""eh"", ""ee"", or silent e.  It's just too much.  They just need to know it says ""eh"" which is the short and most common ""E"" sound in Phonics.  They will build on it later.  The Letter Factory DVD keeps it simple and engaging- your child, along with Tad, will visit a room in the factory where each letter is being trained to make its sound, like the letter K's are dressed in Karate Uniform and kicking their lower legs making the sound ""K!  K!"" And the song is very catchy throughout.  Both of my boys- one a visual learner and one auditory, both completely mastered all 26 letters and short sounds and recognition of each letter within two weeks, and about 7 viewings. They were both under 3.  The video is that good.  They are smart, but it was the video that gave them the edge, better than me by myself.  I watched with them, and stopped every four letters to discuss. My auditory child needed the added tool of holding and selecting letter magnets (added a physical element)during the video, otherwise, he just memorized the sounds and couldn't recognize.
Okay, so back to my review of THIS video....
I liked it!  We watched it for free on Netflix.  I thought it was a great 2nd step in Phonics learning AFTER the ""Letter Factory,"" even though they are from a different Leap Frog series.  Most of the other Leap Frog videos outside of the Letter Factory and Math Circus series (with the Frog character ""Tad"") were kind of lame.  So Phonics Farm was cute and it worked well.  My 3 year old has just been learning that those letter sounds he's so good at actually have to do with words! He didn't need to know that right away.  We have been talking about how ""A"" says ""ah (short)"" for ""apple.""  This video involved a group of animals greeting a train bringing new animals to their farm  Each car had a different letter on the side.  In the ""B"" car, out came a Bear, and it said ""I am a B-B-Bouncing Bear""- nothing further to add, but used the short letter sound only and gave an adjective and an animal to relate to it.  The upper case and lower case letters were on the car, but we ignored the lower case and can work on that later.  My son recognized the capitals so he was right with them.  I thought the songs were not great, but I nothing compares to the work done on ""Letter Factory,"" so I'm biased.  I thought some of the animals were creative.  We didn't just have a Cat for ""C"" we had a ""Colorful Camel.""  And have you ever come up with an animal for ""U"" or ""X""?  The ""U"" animal was an ""Umbrella Bird"" and it was just fine.  For ""X"" I figured they'd make the common mistake and come up with some exotic animal that started with ""X"" but sounded like ""Z"" (think Xylophone!) But they instead chose an Ox and said that the ""X"" was at the end of his name.  It was a great idea, AND they kept the Phonics sounds correct as ""cs.""  Overall, a good video.  Not my favorite, but we will definitely watch again becuase it builds on the sounds my child already knows and applies them to words he is not yet ready to build, and the characters are cute.
--The second video in the ""Letter Factory"" series is also wonderful, but is building words in the ""Talking Words Factory"" and the kids will be building ""CAT"" from ""C"" and ""AT"",  ""MAT"",  ""BAT"", etc.  This is kind of the glue in between those first two videos and our teaching at home and preschool for my child to see how it all fits together.  My 3rd grader reads at a 5th grade level and he jumped off into reading with ""Letter Factory"" series, so I can attest to it's greatness.  And I think this one is a good one too as a supportive video after initial phonics learning.  Hope my incredibly long review helped someone!!",1347667200,40,4350,4.331273176761434

I bought this by mistake, intending to get Letter Factory (as recommended by several friends), but Amazon Instant Video only offered PHonics Farm and I got confused. We watched it, and I was slightly appalled that the letters, sounds, and animations are presented as a pre-READING skill yet the names of the animals are not written out. So you see ""Aa"" and then an alligator comes out and says he's an ""athletic alligator"" but the screen never spells alligator. This is the most simple literacy requisite. It doesn't matter how young the children are; it is always useful to provide the name in writing when presenting sounds/signs/images for little ones.

My son just turned two. He is growing up in a Bi-Lingual family which can cause a delay in actual speaking of words (not speech recognition). So I purchased this DVD and others to replace the Pixar movies he spent time watching. I have to say they are a classroom @ home. He sits, transfixed and is attempting his best to speak what he hears & sees in Leapfrog's DVD's. When he knows a Leapfrog DVD is coming on, he rushes to 'his seat' to watch (bottle in hand).

  Just from listening and poking my head over every now and then, I can say that the program was terribly redundant.  While the animation and style of the cartoon is high quality, it consists entirely of a handful of animals standing on a platform, making discussion and jokes that didn't seem to interest the child, and twenty six crates on a train that open up one after another to reveal a different animal starting with a different letter.

The storyline basically consists of a group of animal friends going to a farm where they meet various animals corresponding to different letters of the alphabet.  For example, they meet a bouncing bear, messy mouse, tired turkey, and zippy zebra.

Skills emphasized:  animal names, general adjectives, letter sounds, extra sounds vowels make

Most of the animals work out quite well and are easy to understand, such as the colorful camel and rocking reindeer.  Others are a little less easy to understand, though this is because there aren't a lot of animals or adjectives that start with certain letters.  The odd otter and whiny walrus might be too tough for some kids to understand, for example, but there aren't a lot of adjectives to work with for these letters.  Also, some of the animals they presented were disappointing in that they were very common animals.  For example, I would have liked to have seen a hungry hippo (instead of a high-pitched horse) or a party penguin (instead of a princely or picky pig).  Also, a victorious vulture carrying a bunch of trophies and ribbons might have been more useful than a violet vulture, especially since people are more likely to use the word ""purple"" in their conversations.  But these are minor issues.

One other strength of this video is that it presents the letters one by one and at a manageable pace.  After maybe 6 or 7 letters are introduced, they review these letters as a set.  (Unfortunately, they don't do this for the final bunch of letters.)  At the end of the movie, they show all the letters in succession as a review.

They also emphasize the most common sound for each letter.  Of course, this means that some letters that have multiple sounds, such as ""c"" or ""g"" get shortchanged.  They might teach ""c"" as in ""captain,"" but not ""c"" as in ""cinema.""  But the one-letter-one-sound theme is probably sufficient for kids this age.  Vowels get two sounds in this video, but again, some sounds fall by the wayside.  They teach ""a"" as in ""apple"" and ""a"" as in ""ape,"" but not ""a"" as in ""father.""  Again, that might be too complex for kids this age.

Parents shouldn't find this video too unbearable to watch.  If anything, the frequent giggling of the animals might get on a parent's nerves after watching this video enough times.  But the songs are upbeat and tolerable for adult ears.  This video has no content that parents should find objectionable.  There is no violence, no unpleasant language, and no teasing or meanness.  It is a solid video that is heavy on learning and light on weaknesses.  I highly recommend it.",1327622400,,2727,4.740425531914894
4710495,4,B005IUIWB6,"From an adult perspective, this is fairly hard to watch, especially after the quality and care of Sesame Street and other productions out there. But our 2 year old loves it, and the actual teaching seems effective. In my opinion the music is horrible, but luckily music is only featured in a couple of segments.

Shoot, we're watching it again and I guess it's kind of charming. The synthetic, longish songs are the main reason for minus one star.",1325462400,2,447,4.658227848101266
4710496,5,B005IUIWB6,"I will only show educational video's to my kids and I love almost all of the Leap Frog video's and this is one of the best ones yet.  I used to be the typical parent and play Shrek, Tangled and all those video's in the car cuz the kids love them and keeps them quite for long rides. In preschool, my 3 year old and was having alot of difficulty learning and memorizing the alphabet, colors and numbers.  He was one of the lucky ones who got into the town preschool via the lottery. I was told that she would suggest holding him back from kindergarten until he was 6.  I got rid of all those worthless DVD's and invested a ton on money on these DVD as well as Rock to Learn and many others.  I would only show these video's in the car, every day, and my now 4 year old knows more than most kids his age and going to kindergarten at age 5.  He knows upper case, lower case, numbers, all shapes, sizes, and have been working on phonics cuz he is ready.  My favorite DVD's for those on a budget are anything by Leap Frog & Rock to Learn are Letter Sounds, Colors Shapes & Counting (age group says 4 but all appropriate for every age). For those with younger kids, I showed these video's to my now just turned 3 year old, and he knows everything backwards and forwards from just watching them in the car. I started my collection of DVD's in April of last year when he was just over 2, and he knew everything by summer. He is also doing sight words and this is all from just watching these awsome video's in the car. His preschool teacher would be shocked and so excited to tell me when I picked him up, that he knows his colors, oh, he knows all his letters, and I sent him to preschool when he was 2 & half cuz his birthday.  I cannot emphasize how valuable these DVD's are in your childs learning.  I have a 1 year old and he now is watching them too, and he is starting to say colors, some alphabet. Love them. Other good ones that are worth every penny are all the Preschool prep DVD's, I just purchased the phonics series, all very good. Munchkin Math ones are good, but expensive and short. Fundamentals DVD (2) are good, but fast paced. My kids did not care for the Baby Genius series, Brainy baby, Galloping Minds (all for younger 1-2 years old) Cedarmount Kids but all get excellent reviews. I just purchased Baby Bumblebee, and they don't care for those, but the opposites one is good. The Hooked on Phonics learn to read by HOB, not good. Also great show on PBS is Word World.  My kids love it and we DVR it, and now that we are learning phonics, I have learned how valuable this show is.  I hope this review is helpful to you. I cannot tell you how these DVDs have changed my kids lives, and how I look at other kids and watch how much they know, and how much better my kids are and its all cuz of these DVD's.  Its worth your hard earned money.",1325462400,135,2852,4.148550724637682

4710498,5,B005IUIWB6,"This DVD is the best one Leapfrog has made so far.  My kids love it (especially the dogs).  It keeps their attention, entertains them, and helps them learn.  I like that it emphasizes on letter sounds. I even enjoy the songs and find myself humming them at times.  It was a great purchase.  I'm going to preorder Leapfrog Numberland too.",1323648000,3,337,4.55
