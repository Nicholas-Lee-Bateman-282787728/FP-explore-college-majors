8603193,5,B002J48Z9I,"When asked about ""which fictional detective do you like best?"", Japanese young adults of 00s might respond: ""Edogawa Konan! No Hajime Kindaichi"". It is an amusing fact that both comic book detective heroes never forget to refer some of legendary detectives such as Kogoro Akechi who appears in Ranpo Edogawa's detective novels.

Kaijin Nijumenso or ""Fiend with twenty faces"" is an archrival of Akechi and legendary fictional thief who is still popular among Japanese aged 30 or older generation. K-20 is an abbreviation for the legendary thief and the story is based on the theory that Heikichi Endo who is said to be the K-20 is not the original K-20 and must be inherited from the first K-20. K-20 in Edogawa's novels is just like what is described in this movie. He gives the warning to steal the target treasure and steal after all evading all the protection devices and guarding police. He is often referred as Japanese version of Lupin.

The movie itself is entirely original story based on no original Ranpo's novels so even though you are familiar with Ranpo's detective novels you may enjoy and be sure to be surprised. There are full of actions and if you are the fans of Takeshi Kaneshiro who are popular as an Asian action star, you will enjoy the movie.

Verdict: Full of actions and thrills.
Rating: 90 out of 100
Recommended for: Takeshi Kaneshiro fans. Fans of detective movies.",1260316800,2,1394,4.8
