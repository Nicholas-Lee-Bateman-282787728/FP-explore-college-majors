My twin boys were hooked after we stumbled upon this video on YouTube, and I finally ordered it here so I could get my computer back. Here's hoping to see more Bumblz episodes in the future!",1217980800,,250,4.456521739130435
8490120,5,B0012KW97O,"What a great adventure! The pirate theme was so exciting for my audience. All 15 of my kindergarten students were transfixed as they watched it during rest time. I ordered  Bumblz: The Pirate's Treasure since the first DVD, Bumblz: The Clubhouse, was such a hit with my grandchildren.  The gentle characters and great concepts promoted, and high interest make this a sure winner.",1204934400,2,379,5.0
