3070513,5,B0011Z5NM8,"This workout totally kicks butt! If you're not sweating after the warm up, you will be sweating after about 60 seconds into the first cardio set, and you will sweat profusely as the workout continues. Warning: the cardio segments are very dancy, however, Alison's cueing is stellar! There are two cardio sets that include light dumbells, one high intensity cardio set. Never fear though, there is an instructor demostrating low impact/beginner modifications, and she gets plenty of camera time! The dvd also features a 25 minute express option, as well as a tutorial that demonstrates some of the moves. This really is an excellent workout to have in your fitness arsenol.",1204588800,38,672,5.063063063063063

3070522,2,B0011Z5NM8,"I've done a number of the Firm Fany Lifter and Transfirmer series workouts. I wished I liked Allison Davis, but I don't find her to be as enjoyable as the other instuctors and I find her to be weak as an instructor. This workout is too fast for the moves that they are using, it is awkward, some of the choreography doesn't make sense and the queing is very poor. I also didn't find the moves to be effective either as a cario workout or a toning workout. There are parts of the workout where all I could think about was the question ""can you pat your head and rub your belly at the same time?"" the moves are not designed for easy cooridnation, your arms and legs often seem to be moving in counterintuitive directions, additionally some of the sets don't end evenly so you have to do a catch up half rep which is confusing. I understand that sometimes you need to get used to a routine, that's not the problem here, it's truly that the moves are awkward and it's really hard to be that coordinated. Think about how much you have to concentrate to pat your head and rub your belly, now try and do that while bouncing, sweating and switching from left to right. As I said the queing is bad, Allison hardly ever tells you left or right, most of the time she just says ""other leg"" if she ques you at all, and she isn't good about telling youu to get ready for the next move. It's frustrating, good queing can really make or break a workout. All that said EVEN if I could manage to get althe choreography down I still think it would hard to keep form due to pace and positioning and I don't think the workout would feel at all challenging cardio or toning/strenght training wise. There are better workouts. Without the step equipment the Firm seem a little lost on how to put together a good workout and it shows.",1403654400,,1809,4.292397660818714

I do like that there are different moves (I get so tired of the same moves with slight variations; this has some new ones!) so that's a plus. But really, there are better, more engaging Firm DVDs. I prefer instructor kelsie Daniels. Alison Davies is a little too dancey, a little too ""come on girls, this is fun!"" for me.

Not terribly confusing choreography but I attend aerobics and step classes regularly.  Nice to have something challenging enough to use at home when I don't feel like driving to the gym in cruddy weather or when I am short on time.

3070530,5,B0011Z5NM8,I have to say first of all that I love doing The Firm exercise videos. I like the mix of cardio and weights. Also it's not just the cardio but the dance type moves which do require some coordination buti like that. Even though I know Firm jargon and I'm familiar with the moves it still took me about 3 tries to be able to follow along with this video . However I find Alison's cuing and timing excellent. The toning sections use light weights but you could easily increase the weights. I would consider myself an intermediate exerciser and I got a really good sweat.

3070539,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I have been doing the Firm for over 20 years. The original 6 volumes are still my favorite but lately, even though I've been rotating between the 6 Strong Body, I have hit a plateau.  I'm really not a fan of the newer Firms, the moves are boring: they start with one set of moves, then add another and another so that after 8 minutes you've done the origina moves of the set like 12 times. Repitious. The originals were challenging and never boring. Anyway, I needed to add a different routine to my current one so I tried this dvd.

The instructor isn't as motivating and the set is bland unlike the original grant ""museum"" set. BUT LET ME TELL YOU: I felt lighter in the tummy and hip area after using it once! Is it repitious? Yes. Kinda boring? Yes. but it does deliver some results and so I'll continue using this dvd.",1316736000,,823,4.303225806451613
3070540,2,B0011Z5NM8,This video just didn't do it for me. I have lost 50lbs and love adding work outs at home when I can't get to the gym. This dvd had slow boring moves I didn't even sweat and just shut it off and put in another video. I wouldn't recommend.,1308873600,,237,3.857142857142857
3070541,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I am less than enthusiastic about the Firm workouts in general but a fan of this particular workout with Alison Davis. I saw that some comments found the movements too difficult to follow... I thought Alison's cuing was fantastic and had no trouble following along. The moves in and of themselves are not overly complicated to pick up so I'm not sure why there were so many complaints. It does take a certain amount of coordination but I was never left confused or stumbling over my feet. If anyone has tried Alison's Cardio Dance Fusion dvd I found this to be less dance-ish and easier to pickup. In my opinion, her cuing is clear and consistent, making it easy to follow.

The workout starts with a warmup that's heavily cardio driven. It's an aerobic routine in and of itself. It then continues to alternate between cardio segments and some segments with weights that still incorporate full body movement throughout so nothing is static. I believe there were 2 weight segments and maybe 4 different cardio routine segments. At the end there is a cool down. I found the intensity level to be moderate (leaning toward the easy side... but I consider high intensity to be the workouts I CAN'T get through, moderate intensity to be the ones I CAN get through but feel like I need to stop and rest, and low intensity to be ones I get through without feeling like I need to stop. This one was manageable to finish without getting discouraged but still worthwhile.) I have bad knees and often have issues with cardio focused workouts that are high impact. I did not experience any discomfort during or after the workout and I did the advanced modifications throughout.

For what it is (a cardio workout) I think it is pretty effective. I kind of wish there was an ab section and some more exercises to make it a more well rounded, balanced workout, but it is more cardio focused and it delivers in this area. It does indirectly target certain muscles inherent to the movements, but even the weight sections that are meant to focus on the upper body I found somewhat simple with 3 lb. weights, which is what I typically use with aerobic workouts of this nature, and in the future I will probably increase the weight to 5 lbs. for more of a challenge. However, to me the most important thing in a workout is that it provides an achievable challenge but is fun and enjoyable throughout. Cardio Overdrive achieves this in my opinion.",1301443200,4,2425,4.624129930394432

3070543,3,B0011Z5NM8,"This work out has a bit more complicated moves then the usual Firm videos, but after about 3-4 workouts you should have it perfectly down. I don't find this as intense as other Firm videos either.

I also want to caution people with knee problems, there are some moves that can be very heavy impact on the knees.
Some of the weighted exercises don't seem very safe, because they are being performed too quickly.

I always have to stress how important form is, and the use of good body mechanics to keep your spine safe.

Some of these moves aren't very safe and can cause harm.",1287964800,2,577,4.4245283018867925

3070548,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I recently purchased The Firm Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection, and this workout was one of the four selections included on that DVD.  Although Allison Davis is not my favorite Firm instructor (more on this below), overall, I found this to be an enjoyable workout that kept my heart rate up.  Allison works out in the newer Firm studio (wood floors, fake windows) with four background exercisers.

The 5-minute warm-up didn't drag like some of the Firm warm-ups tend to do, and it flowed right into the first cardio combination.  (Note: each segment of this workout lasts approximately 5 minutes, and although there are no chapter menus, there are internal chapter breaks so that you could uses the skip button of your remote to move forward & back if desired.)  The initial cardio segment includes step taps, knee ups with a leg sweep, and a ""quad star"" (rather than the usual tri star) with pony arms.  This is followed by the first AWT (aerobic weight training) segment, with Allison and crew using light weights.  The first move is what Allison calls the ""back & bun burner,"" a side squat with row.  Other exercises in this segment include a clean & press with a front kick, a squat with biceps curl, and a front lunge with a side/rear delt raise.  The transitions felt a bit rushed here, but the HR does stay up.

After this, it's back to cardio.  The first move involves a side step forward and back with hip shake or optional skater jumps.  This is followed by a front/back/front kick, a glute/knee/glute raise, and finally, a samba with bow & arrow arms.  The next cardio section was my least favorite.  It was mostly high impact (although Sue Mi showed low-impact options), with power jogs, high knees, and plyos, but I just didn't find the choreography to be very much fun.

Next comes another AWT segment.  This one begins with a dip and scoop combination and then a side/front lunge ""corkscrew"" move.  Moving on, Allison adds knees up with a triceps press and crunch plus a side step with upright row.  After this, there are just two more cardio sections to finish.  The first begins with a back V-step and moves into jacks and knee repeaters.  The second starts with a back-side-front step and then adds in a leg swing, a glute extension, hamstring curls, and twists and swings to finish.  The 6-minute cool-down consists of flowing moves and dynamic stretches, bringing the total workout time right in at 46 minutes.

This is a decent workout that I would rate as low intermediate.  My heart rate stayed within my working zone the entire time, yet I never felt worn out or like I was gasping for breath.  I found most of the choreography to be fun, but sometimes the Firm's arm movements feel a bit ""fussy"" to me, and some of the moves in this workout felt overly rushed.  Still, I thought this was a solid cardio workout, and I would recommend this DVD.",1286841600,2,2867,4.652087475149106
3070549,5,B0011Z5NM8,"I've been doing Cardio Overdrive for a little over a year now & I still absolutely love it!  Yes, it's a bit difficult to learn at first, but after about 3 sessions you will have the routine down.  I've actually incorporated my step just to kick things up a bit.  Definitely love this workout!!  Alison makes it lots of fun & yes, by the time I'm done I am soaked in sweat!!  Keep it up FIRM!",1280102400,,392,4.105263157894737

Alison is awesome at cues and doesn't throw in irrelevant moves.  She has great energy and she looks incredible!  I have a good sized FIRM collection, and she is by far my favorite instructor.

I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser, and the challenge is still there.  I recently let one of my coworkers borrow this DVD, and about a week later, she came in and told me that she figured out where I get my energy from...this workout is an incredible jump-start to your day!",1268006400,,642,4.398305084745763

3070552,3,B0011Z5NM8,"I have been using The Firm workouts for a long time, with that said, I found this DVD to be a little too easy for me. There is more cardio than cardio-scultping (with the weights), so I didn't feel challenged enough - for me. This would be a great workout for someone new to The Firm workouts or someone who was a beginner to intermediate exerciser.",1264723200,3,349,4.303030303030303
3070553,4,B0011Z5NM8,"The Firm has created another classic!!  ""Cardio Overdrive"" is a 45-minute fitness program that combines cardio and intervals of fast-paced, light sculpting.  This DVD is very similar in format and purpose to an earlier Firm title called ""Ultimate Fat Burning Workout,"" in that it uses light weights only and flows through more like fast and slow cardio than cardio and toning.
I LOVE this program!  It is fun, effective and challenging (but without being so difficult that it inspires dread or requires you to eat like Michael Phelps to produce enough energy to get through it!).  If you are a beginner exerciser, it definitely will challenge you and the sweat will pour!  However, if you are an intermediate to advanced, it is a great maintenance workout that will burn calories and help keep you toned in the right places.
""Cardio Overdrive,"" led by instructor Alison Davis, begins with a 5-minute-or-so warm-up.  After a quick back stretch, you pretty much hit the ground running and your feet never really stop.  The warm-up consists of V-steps forward and back, knee raises, glute raises, lunges and quick calf stretches.  Then you're on to the first cardio segment.
All of the cardio in ""CO"" is medium impact. (There is some hopping, but not a whole lot, and what hopping there is can easily be substituted with low-impact squats or other variations.  All variations are demonstrated by Sue Mi, the beginner modifier.)  The cardio is also fun and varied. The moves are of the classic cardio vein, with side-to-side steps/sprints, jacks, high-and-low jogging, repeater knees, and some plyo jumping (the jogging and plyo jumping only occur in one section).  There is NO dance and NO kickboxing (with the exception of a front-and-back kick, no arms, that occurs in one cardio section).
There are 2 toning sections.  In both, Alison suggests that you use light weights (I'm guessing theirs are 3 to 5 lbs., but you can always go a little heavier if you try that weight and it is too easy).  The toning is okay.  It consists of a lot of The Firm's signature compound moves such as moving squats with bicep curls, lunges with L-shaped arms, side lunges with sweeping both arms, knee raises with tricep dips, etc.  The moves are all done quickly, so although your heart rate will come down a little, you still will continue to burn calories AND tone up your muscles somewhat.
Though this program tones, it does so VERY lightly, and it is more of a medium-intensity cardio workout than anything else.  I am a high intermediate, and does this workout max me out?  No. But it is too fun to condemn just b/c it's not crazy hard!  To make it more challenging, you have several options:
1. Add more weight during the toning sections.
2. Add higher impact to the cardio. Hop whereever you can, and do NONE of the lower impact options, not even in the beginning.
3. Add onto ""Cardio Overdrive"" with a short, 20-minute toning workout. To supplement this, I actually add on The Firm's ""Power Sculpt Workout,"" using the green 9-lb. Sculpting Stick.  This program is a mere 20 minutes from beginning to end, and is Perfection for rounding out ""CO"" and making a solid, more difficult hour of exercise.
""Cardio Overdrive"" is another fave.  Great workout, great format, great music, great instructor.  If you want to preview this, check out The Firm's official site.",1263254400,7,3350,4.821678321678322
3070554,5,B0011Z5NM8,"I've been a ""Firm Believer"" for about 12 years now, and I never tire of the Firm's traditional style, but this one doesn't fit that bill as much as most of The Firm's other workouts do. This one is a bit different. Why? I think the cardio is more intense than on some of the other workouts. It's the focus of the workout this time, rather than the side dish. I like that, because sometimes, after lifting weights the day before, I really need something that's mostly cardio. It isn't a beginner workout, in my opinion, but I think intermediates to advanced exercisers will get a good workout from this one. It definitely gets the heart rate up, and quickly!

I've read several reviews here, stating that this workout is too ""dancey"" and/or ""too difficult to learn"". Well, I disagree. That's what the rewind, pause, and slow motion buttons are for. To me, it was no more difficult to learn than any other workout, and it's definitely not as difficult as some of the other instructors' workouts that I've tried in the past. If people think this one is tough to master, then I hope they never try a Cathe workout. Compared to her, this one is a piece of cake! Maybe the first time through would be a challenge to master the moves, but the second and third times through, I think it would get easier.

The best thing about this workout is it's FUN! The time flew by pretty quickly! Always a good thing. The second best thing about this workout is it brings the sweat! By the time the workout ended my hair was soaked, and my sports bra was nearly so. That's the sign of a workout being a ""burner"" and a keeper, in my book.",1263168000,2,1618,4.39
3070555,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I picked up a copy of Alison Davis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Ultimate-Fat-Burning-Workout/dp/B000FZETWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm: Ultimate Fat Burning Workout</a>&nbsp;2 years ago.  This was the first time I ever tried a workout by The Firm, and I have to say I stopped it after the first 20 minutes, frustrated and unhappy because I couldn't pick up the moves.  I swore off all of The Firm workouts after that, thinking they were little more than 40-50 minutes of agony and frustration.  However, I decided to give them another try, and picked up a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Pump-Jump-N-Jab/dp/B0018BEG6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm: Pump, Jump 'N Jab</a>, and loved every minute of it.  Since then, I have become a fan of The Firm, but not necessarily of Alison Davis.  I saw this one in the store, and decided to give it a try, because I wanted a good cardio workout to balance out my DVD workout collection.  I have done this workout twice; the first time I didn't like it much.  However, I have had more experience with The Firm workouts since then, and the second time was much better.  While I can't say I love it, I can say it is a solid cardio workout.  Here's the breakdown:

THE GOOD:

1) It is a nice cardio workout, with a mix of low- and high-impact moves.  I like how the intensity gets ramped up until it is highest in the middle, and then the intensity gets slowed down again.  My heart rate was up pretty much the entire time, especially during the highest-intensity segment that involved running in place and high knees.
2) The segments with the light weights (I used 3 pounds) were easy to follow, and kept my heart rate up because of the use of their ""4-limb"" movements (also known as compound movements).  The pace was brisk during these segments, but I felt safe doing weight-lifting movements with light weights at that pace.
3) I thought the warm-up was very nice, almost a small cardio workout unto itself.
4) A lot of variety to the moves, as usual . . because you really have to pay attention, the time flies by in this workout, and it's over before you know it.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

1) A lot of reviewers say that Alison's cueing is good. . I'm not sure about that.  She does let you know what's coming, but I would have appreciated it if, when we were starting a series of moves ""from the top,"" if she would have reminded me what foot we're starting on.  I'm not that coordinated, and my brain needs a reminder of ""left side!""  or ""right side!""  Rebekah Sturkie & Kelsie Daniels, in their workouts for The Firm, are much better at that, in my opinion.
2) The moves in the very last cardio segment, to me, were too confusing.  Again, if you have some dance experience or have more coordination than myself, you won't have a problem.  However, I had some major issues with keeping up with her during that segment simply because the moves were a little ""fussy.""  I had to just focus on getting the footwork down, and forgo any arm movements that screwed up my footwork.
3) I do wish this workout would have been at least 50 minutes of cardio, with a 5-minute cool-down afterwards.  I just felt it was too short, and wish there had been more than one high-intensity segment in the middle.  While my heart rate was kept elevated, I wish it could have stayed elevated during the middle segment for longer for maximum cardio benefit.

Like I said, this is a solid cardio workout, with some very light weight training segments that still keep your heart rate up.  While I wish it would have been longer and some of the moves less complicated, I have to say I liked it, overall, and will be doing it again.  It's a nice workout to do if you are alternating your strength and cardio days.  Just don't write it off the first time (like I almost did) just because you can't get the moves. . .it will take you a few times through to get them all down.  It's worth the time and effort.",1262390400,3,4045,4.745350500715308
3070556,1,B0011Z5NM8,"Personally, I don't like this instructor, so take my review as you will.  She instructs at a very fast pace, and I am trying so hard to keep up that I am not  paying attention to form.  I am probably doing over half the workout wrong.  Also, it seems like they do not tailor these workouts to be done on carpet.  There is one segment that I have to stay with the ""modified"" version in order to finish because my feet keep getting stuck on the regular.  It is like you are skiing, yet they want you to change directions.  This instructor also is a very ""dance"" oriented instructor.  I prefer the simple moves that anyone can do.  They may be boring, but they are effective because you have proper form!
I use this video in my rotation, but I don't like it.",1256688000,4,755,4.223776223776224
3070557,3,B0011Z5NM8,"So I tried this work-out for the first time this morning. Now, I know that I'm not going to be able to follow ALL the moves on ANY work-out video the first time... but I was TOTALLY lost here. I completed probably less than half of the moves because the instructor just yells out some name of a move and doesn't explain it or walk you through it or anything. Even when it was the 2nd and 3rd time thru the sequence I wasn't able to get thru it. And I consider myself a very quick teach if actually taught properly the first time around. My heart-rate never really felt elevated, but I sweat a little (I'm sure it would've been a better work-out if id have been able to follow it). I don't know if this is a FIRM thing or if they just assume you know what all these names mean and how to do the moves perfectly without any instruction what so ever.

I gave it a 3-star rating because I could see it being a decent work-out if you have all the moves perfected. I don't see it taking less than 5 watches to do that though... I'll probably try this one a few more times, but just be warned, there is no instruction or explanations, so be prepared to get frustrated the first few times thru...",1248825600,7,1188,4.142857142857143
3070558,5,B0011Z5NM8,"This might be my favorite FIRM workout in my little FIRM library. It's so much fun! I think it helps a bit with coordination (if you're like me and some days have 2 left feet). It really gets your heart pumping and you sweat up a storm, but at the same time it's fun!

I know everyone's at a different fitness level, and mine is about intermediate. I didn't experience a whole lotta soreness from it and I never felt like I was gonna pass out. The moves are really energizing!

Some people wanna put it down because Alison repeats the same moves over and over in each segment, but that's the way you gotta do it in my opinion. You gotta focus on one part of the body, and do repetitive moves in order to get the results you want.

I highly recommend this workout to anyone.",1247702400,,773,4.20945945945946
3070559,1,B0011Z5NM8,"If you just love those videos that use terms like ""step-ball-change"" and ""triple-step"" or ""pony"" (whatever that is) then I guess you might like this complicated cardio sequence.  Not only did I feel the cardio moves were very difficult to follow, these ""sculpting moves"" seem a bit like false advertising to me.  I seriously doubt that these will do much sculpting for you.  You quickly go between some different (and kind of silly) moves with weights, but it's part of a fast routine.  You don't have time to switch to a different weight that would be appropriate for each excercise (e.g. row to a lateral raise) so you are either not able to complete half the moves (if your weight is too heavy) or you aren't getting a workout during several moves because the weight is too light.  I'm sure you will burn lots of calories once you are actually able to follow the whole dvd/routine, but since this would take most people several attempts to figure out, why waste your exercise time?  Get an effective DVD like something by Jillian Michaels.  Hers are always easy to follow and consistently get people results.",1245628800,4,1111,4.725388601036269

It is soooo fast paced and I had a really hard time keeping up with the moves.  A lot of moves are used over and over again, which is good because that made it somewhat possible to keep up.  It was discouraging because I felt like I couldn't do the workout properly.  This was a tough video for me, and not in a good way.  I probably won't be putting it into my DVD player again any time soon.  My opinion is biased though, I much prefer yoga and strength training videos, and I like to get my cardio in from jogging or on the elliptical.

Other people complain about the Firm's cuing, and while I agree that the first couple of times are tricky, I appreciate the fact that they move you quickly through the moves so that when you're doing it for the 50th time, you're not completely bored with the ""instructional"" nature of it.

This is a fun workout, it does have it's cheesy moments, such as when Alison says, ""Triceps and tummy are two very important parts of the body for a woman."" In her southern accent, it's just too much and I always wince. However, who cares! It's a good, solid workout with no floor exercises and very little weights.",1236297600,13,782,4.423611111111111

3070579,5,B0011Z5NM8,"This is the best workout I've ever had!  I rented it from Netflix first to see if I liked it, and I ended up purchasing it right away.

I had been using Barry's Bootcamp for the past couple weeks.  It's nice, but with those 30 second breaks every minute, I didn't feel like I was really getting my heart rate up.  I think Barry's is fine for those who are in good shape and want to stay that way, but if you have a lot of fat to lose, the FIRM is the way to go.  I've used them in the past, and it's like taking a potato peeler to the front of your thighs!

I started out this video with high expectations.  The warm-up was kind of fast and I thought maybe I had skipped over it by mistake.  But I kept on going.  I should mention that I'm well over 200lbs; I had used the TransFIRMation steps in the past but you're not supposed to use them if you're over 250lbs. I did, and I cracked them.  I digress. For the othe reviewers who might say that there are missed cues or it's hard to follow... do it again!  Sheesh, an exercise video is to be used many times, not just once and complan that it's too difficult.  They used music like Salt N Pepa's ""Push It"" and at times the moves even felt like I was in a cheerleading competition.  I love the way you learn a couple moves well and then add on. Very easy to follow and a delight to watch.  Sumi is the beginning person and I was happy to see that I could even out-do her -- and she was gettin' down with her bad self!  I don't have bad knees so I can't comment on that, but I could do every thing that was put forth to me.

All of a sudden, she says, ""it's time to cool down..."" Whoa!  I look up and over 40 minutes have passed.  I was disappointed that I didn't sweat, but when I took off my shirt, it was soaking.  Three-quarters of an hour and I didn't realize how hard I was sweating and I didn't realize how much time was flying by.  You work your butt off (literally) and you're having so much fun that you don't feel like it's a workout.  That makes it the best workout on earth!",1226620800,31,2036,3.977777777777778

I do wish there was an abdominal section at the end.  Some of the exercises claim they are working your abs but I didn't feel it at all.

The weight segments are great...I normally find weight segments in vids too short to be effective, but Alison manages to squeeze enough reps in to make it worthwhile. I use 5-8lbs, and this definitely keeps the blood pumping for me.

3070584,3,B0011Z5NM8,"I was so excited to get this DVD.  When I placed it in the DVD player, I had such high hopes; they quickly were deflated.

The warmup was very short and then she jumped right into a bunch of disjointed moves that involved more hand eye coordination than anything else.  For example, swinging the arms in one direction while the legs are going in another direction while raising knees and kicking.

After this segment, she tells you to get the weights and then you use more hand eye coordination to lift weights in an alternate fashion, while moving to the side, and moving your legs.

After that segment, it was more swinging the arms and jumping around.  It keeps going like this.

This was an instructor's attempt to turn a dance routine into a cardio workout; it was not a workout.  This is what I do when I am bored and want to just act a fool in the house.

I do not recommend this DVD to people wanting a serious exercise workout.  THis is more for people that have time to kill to have fun.",1219017600,5,997,4.311827956989247

You have things like basic marches, and it changes in intensity to things like latin dancing and sport like movements.  Alison Davis is a good instructor who is friendly and motivating.  The toning segments aren't too challenging, but they are enough to make you feel like you've done some good the next day.
This workout is probably geared more for the intermediate exerciser; if you're advanced you'll find this too easy and if you're beginning, you might need to take your time getting through the cardio.  I really enjoy it and highly recommend it.",1217635200,12,816,4.561643835616438

I wished I liked Allison Davis, but I don't find her to be as enjoyable as the other instuctors and I find her to be weak as an instructor. This workout is too fast for the moves that they are using, it is awkward, some of the choreography doesn't make sense and the queing is very poor. I also didn't find the moves to be effective either as a cario workout or a toning workout. There are parts of the workout where all I could think about was the question ""can you pat your head and rub your belly at the same time?"" the moves are not designed for easy cooridnation, your arms and legs often seem to be moving in counterintuitive directions, additionally some of the sets don't end evenly so you have to do a catch up half rep which is confusing. I understand that sometimes you need to get used to a routine, that's not the problem here, it's truly that the moves are awkward and it's really hard to be that coordinated. Think about how much you have to concentrate to pat your head and rub your belly, now try and do that while bouncing, sweating and switching from left to right. As I said the queing is bad, Allison hardly ever tells you left or right, most of the time she just says ""other leg"" if she ques you at all, and she isn't good about telling youu to get ready for the next move. It's frustrating, good queing can really make or break a workout. All that said EVEN if I could manage to get althe choreography down I still think it would hard to keep form due to pace and positioning and I don't think the workout would feel at all challenging cardio or toning/strenght training wise.

Also it's not just the cardio but the dance type moves which do require some coordination buti like that. Even though I know Firm jargon and I'm familiar with the moves it still took me about 3 tries to be able to follow along with this video . However I find Alison's cuing and timing excellent. The toning sections use light weights but you could easily increase the weights. I would consider myself an intermediate exerciser and I got a really good sweat.

I'm really not a fan of the newer Firms, the moves are boring: they start with one set of moves, then add another and another so that after 8 minutes you've done the origina moves of the set like 12 times. Repitious. The originals were challenging and never boring. Anyway, I needed to add a different routine to my current one so I tried this dvd.

The instructor isn't as motivating and the set is bland unlike the original grant ""museum"" set. BUT LET ME TELL YOU: I felt lighter in the tummy and hip area after using it once! Is it repitious? Yes. Kinda boring? Yes. but it does deliver some results and so I'll continue using this dvd.",1316736000,,823,4.303225806451613

3305038,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I am less than enthusiastic about the Firm workouts in general but a fan of this particular workout with Alison Davis. I saw that some comments found the movements too difficult to follow... I thought Alison's cuing was fantastic and had no trouble following along. The moves in and of themselves are not overly complicated to pick up so I'm not sure why there were so many complaints. It does take a certain amount of coordination but I was never left confused or stumbling over my feet. If anyone has tried Alison's Cardio Dance Fusion dvd I found this to be less dance-ish and easier to pickup. In my opinion, her cuing is clear and consistent, making it easy to follow.

The workout starts with a warmup that's heavily cardio driven. It's an aerobic routine in and of itself. It then continues to alternate between cardio segments and some segments with weights that still incorporate full body movement throughout so nothing is static. I believe there were 2 weight segments and maybe 4 different cardio routine segments. At the end there is a cool down. I found the intensity level to be moderate (leaning toward the easy side... but I consider high intensity to be the workouts I CAN'T get through, moderate intensity to be the ones I CAN get through but feel like I need to stop and rest, and low intensity to be ones I get through without feeling like I need to stop. This one was manageable to finish without getting discouraged but still worthwhile.) I have bad knees and often have issues with cardio focused workouts that are high impact. I did not experience any discomfort during or after the workout and I did the advanced modifications throughout.

For what it is (a cardio workout) I think it is pretty effective. I kind of wish there was an ab section and some more exercises to make it a more well rounded, balanced workout, but it is more cardio focused and it delivers in this area. It does indirectly target certain muscles inherent to the movements, but even the weight sections that are meant to focus on the upper body I found somewhat simple with 3 lb. weights, which is what I typically use with aerobic workouts of this nature, and in the future I will probably increase the weight to 5 lbs. for more of a challenge. However, to me the most important thing in a workout is that it provides an achievable challenge but is fun and enjoyable throughout. Cardio Overdrive achieves this in my opinion.",1301443200,4,2425,4.624129930394432

I also want to caution people with knee problems, there are some moves that can be very heavy impact on the knees.
Some of the weighted exercises don't seem very safe, because they are being performed too quickly.

I always have to stress how important form is, and the use of good body mechanics to keep your spine safe.

3305045,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I recently purchased The Firm Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection, and this workout was one of the four selections included on that DVD.  Although Allison Davis is not my favorite Firm instructor (more on this below), overall, I found this to be an enjoyable workout that kept my heart rate up.  Allison works out in the newer Firm studio (wood floors, fake windows) with four background exercisers.

The 5-minute warm-up didn't drag like some of the Firm warm-ups tend to do, and it flowed right into the first cardio combination.  (Note: each segment of this workout lasts approximately 5 minutes, and although there are no chapter menus, there are internal chapter breaks so that you could uses the skip button of your remote to move forward & back if desired.)  The initial cardio segment includes step taps, knee ups with a leg sweep, and a ""quad star"" (rather than the usual tri star) with pony arms.  This is followed by the first AWT (aerobic weight training) segment, with Allison and crew using light weights.  The first move is what Allison calls the ""back & bun burner,"" a side squat with row.  Other exercises in this segment include a clean & press with a front kick, a squat with biceps curl, and a front lunge with a side/rear delt raise.  The transitions felt a bit rushed here, but the HR does stay up.

After this, it's back to cardio.  The first move involves a side step forward and back with hip shake or optional skater jumps.  This is followed by a front/back/front kick, a glute/knee/glute raise, and finally, a samba with bow & arrow arms.  The next cardio section was my least favorite.  It was mostly high impact (although Sue Mi showed low-impact options), with power jogs, high knees, and plyos, but I just didn't find the choreography to be very much fun.

Next comes another AWT segment.  This one begins with a dip and scoop combination and then a side/front lunge ""corkscrew"" move.  Moving on, Allison adds knees up with a triceps press and crunch plus a side step with upright row.  After this, there are just two more cardio sections to finish.  The first begins with a back V-step and moves into jacks and knee repeaters.  The second starts with a back-side-front step and then adds in a leg swing, a glute extension, hamstring curls, and twists and swings to finish.  The 6-minute cool-down consists of flowing moves and dynamic stretches, bringing the total workout time right in at 46 minutes.

This is a decent workout that I would rate as low intermediate.  My heart rate stayed within my working zone the entire time, yet I never felt worn out or like I was gasping for breath.  I found most of the choreography to be fun, but sometimes the Firm's arm movements feel a bit ""fussy"" to me, and some of the moves in this workout felt overly rushed.  Still, I thought this was a solid cardio workout, and I would recommend this DVD.",1286841600,2,2867,4.652087475149106

Alison is awesome at cues and doesn't throw in irrelevant moves.  She has great energy and she looks incredible!  I have a good sized FIRM collection, and she is by far my favorite instructor.

I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser, and the challenge is still there.

There is more cardio than cardio-scultping (with the weights), so I didn't feel challenged enough - for me.

3305050,4,B0011Z5NM8,"The Firm has created another classic!!  ""Cardio Overdrive"" is a 45-minute fitness program that combines cardio and intervals of fast-paced, light sculpting.  This DVD is very similar in format and purpose to an earlier Firm title called ""Ultimate Fat Burning Workout,"" in that it uses light weights only and flows through more like fast and slow cardio than cardio and toning.
I LOVE this program!  It is fun, effective and challenging (but without being so difficult that it inspires dread or requires you to eat like Michael Phelps to produce enough energy to get through it!).  If you are a beginner exerciser, it definitely will challenge you and the sweat will pour!  However, if you are an intermediate to advanced, it is a great maintenance workout that will burn calories and help keep you toned in the right places.
""Cardio Overdrive,"" led by instructor Alison Davis, begins with a 5-minute-or-so warm-up.  After a quick back stretch, you pretty much hit the ground running and your feet never really stop.  The warm-up consists of V-steps forward and back, knee raises, glute raises, lunges and quick calf stretches.  Then you're on to the first cardio segment.
All of the cardio in ""CO"" is medium impact. (There is some hopping, but not a whole lot, and what hopping there is can easily be substituted with low-impact squats or other variations.  All variations are demonstrated by Sue Mi, the beginner modifier.)  The cardio is also fun and varied. The moves are of the classic cardio vein, with side-to-side steps/sprints, jacks, high-and-low jogging, repeater knees, and some plyo jumping (the jogging and plyo jumping only occur in one section).  There is NO dance and NO kickboxing (with the exception of a front-and-back kick, no arms, that occurs in one cardio section).
There are 2 toning sections.  In both, Alison suggests that you use light weights (I'm guessing theirs are 3 to 5 lbs., but you can always go a little heavier if you try that weight and it is too easy).  The toning is okay.  It consists of a lot of The Firm's signature compound moves such as moving squats with bicep curls, lunges with L-shaped arms, side lunges with sweeping both arms, knee raises with tricep dips, etc.  The moves are all done quickly, so although your heart rate will come down a little, you still will continue to burn calories AND tone up your muscles somewhat.
Though this program tones, it does so VERY lightly, and it is more of a medium-intensity cardio workout than anything else.  I am a high intermediate, and does this workout max me out?  No. But it is too fun to condemn just b/c it's not crazy hard!  To make it more challenging, you have several options:
1. Add more weight during the toning sections.
2. Add higher impact to the cardio. Hop whereever you can, and do NONE of the lower impact options, not even in the beginning.
3. Add onto ""Cardio Overdrive"" with a short, 20-minute toning workout. To supplement this, I actually add on The Firm's ""Power Sculpt Workout,"" using the green 9-lb. Sculpting Stick.  This program is a mere 20 minutes from beginning to end, and is Perfection for rounding out ""CO"" and making a solid, more difficult hour of exercise.
""Cardio Overdrive"" is another fave.  Great workout, great format, great music, great instructor.  If you want to preview this, check out The Firm's official site.",1263254400,7,3350,4.821678321678322
3305051,5,B0011Z5NM8,"I've been a ""Firm Believer"" for about 12 years now, and I never tire of the Firm's traditional style, but this one doesn't fit that bill as much as most of The Firm's other workouts do. This one is a bit different. Why? I think the cardio is more intense than on some of the other workouts. It's the focus of the workout this time, rather than the side dish. I like that, because sometimes, after lifting weights the day before, I really need something that's mostly cardio. It isn't a beginner workout, in my opinion, but I think intermediates to advanced exercisers will get a good workout from this one. It definitely gets the heart rate up, and quickly!

I've read several reviews here, stating that this workout is too ""dancey"" and/or ""too difficult to learn"". Well, I disagree. That's what the rewind, pause, and slow motion buttons are for. To me, it was no more difficult to learn than any other workout, and it's definitely not as difficult as some of the other instructors' workouts that I've tried in the past. If people think this one is tough to master, then I hope they never try a Cathe workout. Compared to her, this one is a piece of cake! Maybe the first time through would be a challenge to master the moves, but the second and third times through, I think it would get easier.

The best thing about this workout is it's FUN! The time flew by pretty quickly! Always a good thing. The second best thing about this workout is it brings the sweat! By the time the workout ended my hair was soaked, and my sports bra was nearly so. That's the sign of a workout being a ""burner"" and a keeper, in my book.",1263168000,2,1618,4.39
3305052,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I picked up a copy of Alison Davis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Ultimate-Fat-Burning-Workout/dp/B000FZETWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm: Ultimate Fat Burning Workout</a>&nbsp;2 years ago.  This was the first time I ever tried a workout by The Firm, and I have to say I stopped it after the first 20 minutes, frustrated and unhappy because I couldn't pick up the moves.  I swore off all of The Firm workouts after that, thinking they were little more than 40-50 minutes of agony and frustration.  However, I decided to give them another try, and picked up a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Pump-Jump-N-Jab/dp/B0018BEG6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm: Pump, Jump 'N Jab</a>, and loved every minute of it.  Since then, I have become a fan of The Firm, but not necessarily of Alison Davis.  I saw this one in the store, and decided to give it a try, because I wanted a good cardio workout to balance out my DVD workout collection.  I have done this workout twice; the first time I didn't like it much.  However, I have had more experience with The Firm workouts since then, and the second time was much better.  While I can't say I love it, I can say it is a solid cardio workout.  Here's the breakdown:

THE GOOD:

1) It is a nice cardio workout, with a mix of low- and high-impact moves.  I like how the intensity gets ramped up until it is highest in the middle, and then the intensity gets slowed down again.  My heart rate was up pretty much the entire time, especially during the highest-intensity segment that involved running in place and high knees.
2) The segments with the light weights (I used 3 pounds) were easy to follow, and kept my heart rate up because of the use of their ""4-limb"" movements (also known as compound movements).  The pace was brisk during these segments, but I felt safe doing weight-lifting movements with light weights at that pace.
3) I thought the warm-up was very nice, almost a small cardio workout unto itself.
4) A lot of variety to the moves, as usual . . because you really have to pay attention, the time flies by in this workout, and it's over before you know it.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

1) A lot of reviewers say that Alison's cueing is good. . I'm not sure about that.  She does let you know what's coming, but I would have appreciated it if, when we were starting a series of moves ""from the top,"" if she would have reminded me what foot we're starting on.  I'm not that coordinated, and my brain needs a reminder of ""left side!""  or ""right side!""  Rebekah Sturkie & Kelsie Daniels, in their workouts for The Firm, are much better at that, in my opinion.
2) The moves in the very last cardio segment, to me, were too confusing.  Again, if you have some dance experience or have more coordination than myself, you won't have a problem.  However, I had some major issues with keeping up with her during that segment simply because the moves were a little ""fussy.""  I had to just focus on getting the footwork down, and forgo any arm movements that screwed up my footwork.
3) I do wish this workout would have been at least 50 minutes of cardio, with a 5-minute cool-down afterwards.  I just felt it was too short, and wish there had been more than one high-intensity segment in the middle.  While my heart rate was kept elevated, I wish it could have stayed elevated during the middle segment for longer for maximum cardio benefit.

Like I said, this is a solid cardio workout, with some very light weight training segments that still keep your heart rate up.  While I wish it would have been longer and some of the moves less complicated, I have to say I liked it, overall, and will be doing it again.  It's a nice workout to do if you are alternating your strength and cardio days.  Just don't write it off the first time (like I almost did) just because you can't get the moves. . .it will take you a few times through to get them all down.  It's worth the time and effort.",1262390400,3,4045,4.745350500715308
3305053,1,B0011Z5NM8,"Personally, I don't like this instructor, so take my review as you will.  She instructs at a very fast pace, and I am trying so hard to keep up that I am not  paying attention to form.  I am probably doing over half the workout wrong.  Also, it seems like they do not tailor these workouts to be done on carpet.  There is one segment that I have to stay with the ""modified"" version in order to finish because my feet keep getting stuck on the regular.  It is like you are skiing, yet they want you to change directions.  This instructor also is a very ""dance"" oriented instructor.  I prefer the simple moves that anyone can do.  They may be boring, but they are effective because you have proper form!
I use this video in my rotation, but I don't like it.",1256688000,4,755,4.223776223776224
3305054,3,B0011Z5NM8,"So I tried this work-out for the first time this morning. Now, I know that I'm not going to be able to follow ALL the moves on ANY work-out video the first time... but I was TOTALLY lost here. I completed probably less than half of the moves because the instructor just yells out some name of a move and doesn't explain it or walk you through it or anything. Even when it was the 2nd and 3rd time thru the sequence I wasn't able to get thru it. And I consider myself a very quick teach if actually taught properly the first time around. My heart-rate never really felt elevated, but I sweat a little (I'm sure it would've been a better work-out if id have been able to follow it). I don't know if this is a FIRM thing or if they just assume you know what all these names mean and how to do the moves perfectly without any instruction what so ever.

I gave it a 3-star rating because I could see it being a decent work-out if you have all the moves perfected. I don't see it taking less than 5 watches to do that though... I'll probably try this one a few more times, but just be warned, there is no instruction or explanations, so be prepared to get frustrated the first few times thru...",1248825600,7,1188,4.142857142857143
3305055,5,B0011Z5NM8,"This might be my favorite FIRM workout in my little FIRM library. It's so much fun! I think it helps a bit with coordination (if you're like me and some days have 2 left feet). It really gets your heart pumping and you sweat up a storm, but at the same time it's fun!

I know everyone's at a different fitness level, and mine is about intermediate. I didn't experience a whole lotta soreness from it and I never felt like I was gonna pass out. The moves are really energizing!

Some people wanna put it down because Alison repeats the same moves over and over in each segment, but that's the way you gotta do it in my opinion. You gotta focus on one part of the body, and do repetitive moves in order to get the results you want.

I highly recommend this workout to anyone.",1247702400,,773,4.20945945945946
3305056,1,B0011Z5NM8,"If you just love those videos that use terms like ""step-ball-change"" and ""triple-step"" or ""pony"" (whatever that is) then I guess you might like this complicated cardio sequence.  Not only did I feel the cardio moves were very difficult to follow, these ""sculpting moves"" seem a bit like false advertising to me.  I seriously doubt that these will do much sculpting for you.  You quickly go between some different (and kind of silly) moves with weights, but it's part of a fast routine.  You don't have time to switch to a different weight that would be appropriate for each excercise (e.g. row to a lateral raise) so you are either not able to complete half the moves (if your weight is too heavy) or you aren't getting a workout during several moves because the weight is too light.  I'm sure you will burn lots of calories once you are actually able to follow the whole dvd/routine, but since this would take most people several attempts to figure out, why waste your exercise time?  Get an effective DVD like something by Jillian Michaels.  Hers are always easy to follow and consistently get people results.",1245628800,4,1111,4.725388601036269
3305057,1,B0011Z5NM8,"This video is ridiculous.  It just reminds me of the super fast-paced aerobic videos my mom used to do in our living room when I was little.  It is soooo fast paced and I had a really hard time keeping up with the moves.  A lot of moves are used over and over again, which is good because that made it somewhat possible to keep up.  It was discouraging because I felt like I couldn't do the workout properly.  This was a tough video for me, and not in a good way.  I probably won't be putting it into my DVD player again any time soon.  My opinion is biased though, I much prefer yoga and strength training videos, and I like to get my cardio in from jogging or on the elliptical.  So take my review with a grain of salt, because I am new to this type of video.",1245024000,7,761,3.993377483443709

3305059,5,B0011Z5NM8,"Excellent workout to pump your heart to a maximum level.  It alternates between hard cardio movements and some minutes of weight lifting.

3305062,4,B0011Z5NM8,"This is a great solid workout with both cardio and strength training.  Not too hard, but gets your heart rate up (I did the 45 minute program and my heart monitor showed 423 calories burned).  My only complaint is the cuing isn't all that great.  I'm sure with time I'll catch on, but the first time around was hard to figure out what move she was going to do next and how many reps.  Overall, good DVD.",1239667200,,403,4.194805194805195

Other people complain about the Firm's cuing, and while I agree that the first couple of times are tricky, I appreciate the fact that they move you quickly through the moves so that when you're doing it for the 50th time, you're not completely bored with the ""instructional"" nature of it.

This is a fun workout, it does have it's cheesy moments, such as when Alison says, ""Triceps and tummy are two very important parts of the body for a woman."" In her southern accent, it's just too much and I always wince. However, who cares! It's a good, solid workout with no floor exercises and very little weights.",1236297600,13,782,4.423611111111111
3305074,4,B0011Z5NM8,Like any of the Firm videos I own it is certainly a challenge.  The 25 minute express segment is the best way to work into this video.  Starting with the 45 minute cardio overdrive is a bit overwhelming.,1236211200,,203,4.315789473684211

3305076,5,B0011Z5NM8,"This is the best workout I've ever had!  I rented it from Netflix first to see if I liked it, and I ended up purchasing it right away.

I had been using Barry's Bootcamp for the past couple weeks.  It's nice, but with those 30 second breaks every minute, I didn't feel like I was really getting my heart rate up.  I think Barry's is fine for those who are in good shape and want to stay that way, but if you have a lot of fat to lose, the FIRM is the way to go.  I've used them in the past, and it's like taking a potato peeler to the front of your thighs!

I started out this video with high expectations.  The warm-up was kind of fast and I thought maybe I had skipped over it by mistake.  But I kept on going.  I should mention that I'm well over 200lbs; I had used the TransFIRMation steps in the past but you're not supposed to use them if you're over 250lbs. I did, and I cracked them.  I digress. For the othe reviewers who might say that there are missed cues or it's hard to follow... do it again!  Sheesh, an exercise video is to be used many times, not just once and complan that it's too difficult.  They used music like Salt N Pepa's ""Push It"" and at times the moves even felt like I was in a cheerleading competition.  I love the way you learn a couple moves well and then add on. Very easy to follow and a delight to watch.  Sumi is the beginning person and I was happy to see that I could even out-do her -- and she was gettin' down with her bad self!  I don't have bad knees so I can't comment on that, but I could do every thing that was put forth to me.

All of a sudden, she says, ""it's time to cool down..."" Whoa!  I look up and over 40 minutes have passed.  I was disappointed that I didn't sweat, but when I took off my shirt, it was soaking.  Three-quarters of an hour and I didn't realize how hard I was sweating and I didn't realize how much time was flying by.  You work your butt off (literally) and you're having so much fun that you don't feel like it's a workout.  That makes it the best workout on earth!",1226620800,31,2036,3.977777777777778
3305077,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I love this workout.  Lots of cardio, not too complicated.  You do need light and heavy dumbells but no step. A lot of the moves are newer for The Firm and they are fun but challenging, really working stabilizing muscles and relying on balance.  It's 45 minutes with a great warmup and cool down.  I do wish there was an abdominal section at the end.  Some of the exercises claim they are working your abs but I didn't feel it at all.  Maybe that is the best kind of exercise?",1223078400,,476,4.233333333333333

The 45 minutes fly by due to the fun and varied moves, as well as the pace.  The weight segments are great...I normally find weight segments in vids too short to be effective, but Alison manages to squeeze enough reps in to make it worthwhile. I use 5-8lbs, and this definitely keeps the blood pumping for me.  I won't break down the entire program, as others have done this... so, the verdict for me is exhilarating cardio, strength, and motivating music... what more can you ask for??  Definitely a keeper.",1219795200,3,681,4.416

I had done a lot of the Firm a few years ago and loved it then, but had fallen away from the Firm in the last couple of years because everything seemed like the ""same old, same old"".  I read some good reviews for this one, so I gave it a try.  I'm really glad that I did! The cueing is great, the moves are more innovative than I've seen from the Firm in the past.  Allison is a very pleasant instructor.  It's a nice break from some of the harder DVD's I usually do, but I still feel like I'm getting a good workout. I highly recommend!",1219795200,4,603,3.958677685950413
3305081,3,B0011Z5NM8,"I was so excited to get this DVD.  When I placed it in the DVD player, I had such high hopes; they quickly were deflated.

The warmup was very short and then she jumped right into a bunch of disjointed moves that involved more hand eye coordination than anything else.  For example, swinging the arms in one direction while the legs are going in another direction while raising knees and kicking.

After this segment, she tells you to get the weights and then you use more hand eye coordination to lift weights in an alternate fashion, while moving to the side, and moving your legs.

After that segment, it was more swinging the arms and jumping around.  It keeps going like this.

This was an instructor's attempt to turn a dance routine into a cardio workout; it was not a workout.  This is what I do when I am bored and want to just act a fool in the house.

I do not recommend this DVD to people wanting a serious exercise workout.  THis is more for people that have time to kill to have fun.",1219017600,5,997,4.311827956989247
3305082,5,B0011Z5NM8,I love it; when I think that the fun is over Allison turns it up with moves that I have never seen before.  Allison gives an equal amount of time to strength training and cardio.  The moves are easy to do but heart pumping at the same time.  I would recommend this workout if you need to turn it up.,1218844800,3,299,3.95
3305083,5,B0011Z5NM8,"This is a very good workout and I really enjoy doing it.  It's a little more than half an hour of solid cardio and because it's fun, you're finished before you know it.  It doesn't slow down at all and that keeps your heart rate up and keeps you burning fat away.
You have things like basic marches, and it changes in intensity to things like latin dancing and sport like movements.  Alison Davis is a good instructor who is friendly and motivating.  The toning segments aren't too challenging, but they are enough to make you feel like you've done some good the next day.
This workout is probably geared more for the intermediate exerciser; if you're advanced you'll find this too easy and if you're beginning, you might need to take your time getting through the cardio.  I really enjoy it and highly recommend it.",1217635200,12,816,4.561643835616438

Alison has you do cardio, then add light weights to the cardio, so you switch back and forth thru the whole workout. She keeps me moving so I don't get distracted. I live on the 2nd floor in an apartment and a lot of workout programs I read have jumping and running that I can't do.

This is definitely going to be added to be part of my workout routines for the week (which is currently lacking in the cardio area).

As an advanced exerciser, I found that this was not too intense, but it did manage to keep my heart rate high (even during the toning segments). Please note the toning segments are not static toning, but they do have a cardio ""feel"" to them. The full workout is completed in 46 minutes, and you can complete the express workout in 25 minutes.

I thought Allison did a great job and there was only one awkward arm movement in the last cardio segment. She (or the choreographers) must have some ballet training because I noted that she incorporates two ballet moves into the cardio segments. I give this a definite 5 stars.

This one is quite the opposite.  The full 45 minute workout had me sweating and kept my heart rate at 80% for the majority of the ""bulk"" of the workout.  The tape starts with a short warm-up that showcases some moves that will be used later in the workout.  Then, you move into cardio sets (I think there are about 5, maybe 6) that get increasingly harder, peak, and then become easier and finally end with a cool-down.  I was also concerned with this tape (and all of the new TransFIRMation tapes that do not use the step) because I was sure it wouldn't provide a good calorie-burning workout.  I was very wrong.  This tape burned 400 calories according to my HRM.  This tape is definitely in my top 5 Firm workouts!",1210204800,13,873,4.372670807453416

8243068,4,B0011Z5NM8,"I used to do Firm workouts all the time; my favorites where the post-Classics.  Then, Firm workouts changed and I've been in search workouts by this company that I like ever since.  I've had an espcially hard time with Pink Firms and after.  They all seem the same and even if I like a workout, I'm not likely to reach for it ever again.  However, I've begun to find a few that I like and will do periodically.  I purchased The Firm Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection, and about 3 workouts from this DVD are ones that I enjoy and do.  Although Allison Davis is one of my favorite Firm instructors these days.

I am a low intermediate with bad knees and bad hands.  I look for workouts that either have a modifier and/or are easily modified and I found that this workout fit that criteria.  The modifier was pretty good.  And, one of the things that I liked about this workout over other Firm workouts is that Allison encourages you to choose your level without ALWAYS referring to anyone who follows the modifier as a beginner.  overall, I enjoy this workout and feel like I get a good workout from it.  It doesn't seem as long or repetetive as some other Firm workouts.  Dont' get me wrong, they do repeat moves, but it doesn't drag for me.

In general, the workout alternates cardio sections with sections comprised of strength-oriented cardio moves.  There really isn't much that I would classify as purely strength. I enjoyed the combiantions and found a number of the moves fun.  Allison tends to start with the lower body part of a move and then add the upper body.  She'll combine a couple of moves, do them for awhiile and then add 2-3 more moves.",1435104000,2,1652,4.508417508417509
