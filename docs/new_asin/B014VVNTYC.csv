7425150,4,B014VVNTYC,"Cooks Corner has been on PBS for more than eight seasons. I watch it periodically but not all the time. And when I find a recipe I want to try, I have to watch it a few times to get it right. Thats why I like the DVDs.

But, one function I REALLY like is you can watch a series of segments all at once. What I mean by this is that each episode of the show has a few recipe segments, but there are also product reviews  like non-stick pans or coffee makers  and food tastings ( best frozen dinner rolls or best grapefruit juice). These last two types of segments, youll probably only want to watch once. So I put in a DVD (there are two discs in this set) and watch the review sections back to back (these take about 30 minutes each). Then I go to the recipes.

Im not a really creative cook and so I don't choose recipes that are high in calories or complicated. But in this season the Roast Chicken with potatoes  shown on the DVD cover  caught my eye and I made it the night I watched it. It went over great. I also tried the smoked bourbon chicken. There are some more Ive yet to get to.

There are many cooking shows on TV but, for some reason  I guess its the variety  I like this one.

The DVDs also contain a pdf of all the recipes that you can print out.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8732053,5,B014VVNTYC,"So, this is a great PBS series in a few ways.

- Christopher Kimball and the other cast fit well together, it's a well balance cast
- Kitchen equipment testing is a part of each episode, and always helpful
- Food product testing is also a section of each episode, and are atleast entertaining, and also usually useful information you didn't know before
- Recipes are easy to follow

All in all, excellent series worth spending 20$ to own each season in my opinion.",1510963200,,464,4.511904761904762
