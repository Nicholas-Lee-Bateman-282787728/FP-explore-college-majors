2510261,5,B000E8N5DW,"i am very particular when it comes to exercises.  i exercise regularly and am always looking for a challange.  i hate the ab routines that are pointless and spend to much time talking.  after the short warm up it jumps right into the abs...four segments.  a pilates, a core, a basic crunch, and stability ball.  i loved them all.  it hits every angle.  at first i was boerd with the core, but once i focused it really works for strength which helps to result in better abs.  they provide great options for the beginner as well as advanced.  love it love it love it!",1146700800,15,565,4.355769230769231
2510262,5,B000E8N5DW,"Abdominals are a hard area to tone, but if you do regular cardio and follow a great workout like this, then you'll see results fairly soon.

Chris Freytag leads this workout again (she's done most of their other ones) and she's a good instructor.  She's friendly and down to earth and I find that motivating.  There are four segments here.  One is on a stability ball, pilates, core work and regular classic crunches.  Each segment is between 8-9 minutes long so it's a good length of time, without straining or tiring easily.  No angle is left out here.  Abs are worked from all angles.  I like the fact that you can do all of the workouts or some or one.  Basically the only piece of equipment you need is a stability ball, and trust me - do this about 5 days a week and you will get good results.",1146182400,27,799,4.308724832214765
2510263,4,B000E8N5DW,So far I have done 2 of the four workouts on this DVD and I liked them both. They were short and sweet(which is really good for a beginner....or a new mom like me) I really felt the burn the first few times I've done them...but I've only had them for 2 weeks now. I really like the stability ball Ab routine....it's my favorite so far. The three women in the video are not annoying and too smiley like in some exercise videos. All in all a great purchase.,1211846400,,455,4.123595505617978
2510264,1,B000E8N5DW,There is not enough time spent on the actual ab exercises.  The exercises are not very challenging.,1211673600,,99,4.823529411764706
2510265,3,B000E8N5DW,"Prevention has produced a pretty good series of at-home exercise programs.  However, most of their DVDs are geared towards the beginner/low intermediate category, and this one is no exception.
The format is made up of four 8-minute ab routines (each routine has the same built-in 2-minute warmup and 2-minute cooldown which can be skipped when they become annoying).  The routines are: stability ball, pilates, classic abs and core training.  Chris Freytag is an encouraging and knowledgeable instructor with a cheery, slight Minnesota accent.  The moves themselves also help to make this program noteworthy even for advanced exercisers.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that even in the ""classic abs"" section, there were actually very few ""classic"" moves. Chris manages to put a different spin on almost everything, so the exercises stay fresh.
In my opinion, the least challenging is the pilates routine.  In this, you will find roll-ups, the saw, the hundred and some others. However: One- I guess I'm a purist, but it always kinda bothers me when a ""pilates"" segment is done in shoes, and Two- They either moved too quickly or didn't do enough reps, because I hardly feel any sort of burn.
The most challenging for me was the core training section (though, ironically, not a great ab routine).  The core training section incorporates squats, plies, planks,and twisting.  I really like the music, and it makes me break a sweat every time.  However, I feel it most in my buns, thighs, arms and sides of my waist...and very little in my abs.  Go figure!
The most effective ab sculpters for me were the classic abs and the stability ball.
However...NONE of the routines gave me a significant burn with just one 12-minute session.  I feel that any intermediate-to-advanced exerciser would have to combine them.  As I am always looking for SHORT, effective routines to add onto my 45-minute+ workouts, this defeats the purpose.
I would have to recommend in its stead 10 MINUTE SOLUTIONS' BLAST OFF THE BELLY FAT with Suzanne Bowen.  It does what is says...in 10 minutes!",1211241600,12,2071,5.002915451895044
2510266,3,B000E8N5DW,The good news is that the instructor isn't annoying like many in fitness DVDs.  The bad news is that I am not a beginner at this and this is a video that seemed very much like a beginner workout.  I don't think I broke a sweat.,1204675200,3,227,3.9130434782608696
2510267,5,B000E8N5DW,Chris Freytag rocks! I love this dvd. Simple yet the results happen! Chris is very motivating. I highly recommend!,1179014400,4,114,5.052631578947368
2510268,5,B000E8N5DW,"I go to the gym 6 days a week, combining cardio, spinning, and PUMP (low weight, high reps resistance training) and have lost 50lbs.  Doing abs only 3 days a week isn't cutting it for my goal, so I ordered this.  GREAT for intermediate, but she also offers modifications for beginners.  With 4 different workouts, I can do a different one everyday & not get bored - plus it goes FAST - 12 minute segments.  FOR SURE worth my $10.99.  Will probably buy more of Chris' Prevention DVDS!",1155168000,18,483,4.443181818181818
2510269,5,B000E8N5DW,Ever since I turned 40 I have had a few more issues in the ab area!  Chris Freytag's DVD is just what the doctor ordered!  After I run or do a cardio workout I try to follow it with an ab workout and this DVD gives you 4 different workouts to pick from (all of which really target those abs!).  The fact that the workouts are only 12 minutes really helps me actually do them... time constraints are a big reality when you have a hectic schedule.  There is NO excuse not to sneak an ab workout in daily with this DVD in your house!,1152921600,18,530,4.019047619047619
2510270,4,B000E8N5DW,"With the 4 different sections, you have lots of variety and very effective exercises.  The video works the abs from all angles.  Chris Freytag is a friendly instructor and cues well.  I liked the stability ball and classic crunch segments best.  I felt the most burn from them.  In the stability ball section, you'll do crunches on the ball, reverse curls and lift and lower the ball with your legs which really works the lower abs.  The classic crunch section had lots of leg variations.  The exercise where you lie on your side and pull your legs towards your chest really works.  I didn't care for the core training which started with standing balance moves.  They were pretty easy and I didn't think they did much. The ending plank moves were tough.  The pilates section was just o.k. It had familiar exercises.  One exerciser shows modifications, so this is a video you can grow with. I liked this better than Self's Firm, Flat Abs Fast.",1151884800,17,942,4.648484848484848
2510271,5,B000E8N5DW,"I love this new video that Prevention released. If you do her workout right you feel the burn.  She really knows what she is doing.  And she explains the moves very clearly.  This video is also great because if you only have a short time you are able to do only one part, either pilates, stability ball workouts, regular crunchs or core excercises.  I love using the stability ball the best!

Chris is also so motivational and I have loved all of her videos.  I would reccommend any of them to beginners or advanced workout queens!  She really explains the moves well and I am impressed with the fact that I never get tired of her workouts!",1147737600,12,640,4.418803418803419
2510272,3,B000E8N5DW,"I bought this video because I like the Prevention 3-2-1 video, and because I like Chris Freytag, however overall I was pretty disappointed. Each section consists of 8 or 9 minutes of abdominal exercises, but the moves are modified to suit the earliest beginners and do not consist of enough reps to fatigue the muscles (or even make you feel like you've been working out). I don't consider myself to be in great shape, but I did the entire video from beginning to end and didn't break a sweat or feel like I'd accomplished much. I gave the video three stars because I did like the variety of moves and angles that were worked and because I think for a beginner this might be a good abs workout. For intermediate exercisers I would recommend Tamilee Web's ""I want that Body"" video or one of the other Gaiam Pilates videos, which provide better overall abdominal work.",1147305600,13,866,4.593548387096774
8107464,5,B000E8N5DW,"Chris Freytag just has such a friendly, encouraging way about her. She makes me try harder at exercise! I like the length of these ab workouts and there is a warm up and cool down for anyone who doesn't combine it with their other workout.",1502755200,,239,4.333333333333333

8107470,5,B000E8N5DW,I am a curvy girl with pretty flat abs. I carry my weight in my hips and butt. Doing lots of Pilates as well as cardio to trim those areas but I also wanted to add some definition to my abs. If you are an advanced level exerciser then this DVD might not be tough enough for you but anyone who is a Beginner or Beginner-Intermediate or just Intermediate will benefit from it. I love that its cut into segments so that you can do as much or as little as you want. I use my Ab Roller and an Ab Lounge a couple of times a week and I have done ab work in the past but not consistently. Each segment was doable and I did feel my abs burning. I like it a lot and will be using in my weekly rotation. Nothing will take the place of my ab lounge as I can watch TV on it...lol! This is certainly worth adding to your library!,1335484800,,815,3.857142857142857
8107471,3,B000E8N5DW,"This is the first of the prevention fitness systems DVD's that I have tried. I wasn't super impressed. For starters, Chris Freytag (the instructor) is way too chipper and happy for me. She has a perma-smile the entire time that is fake looking and annoying. The other issue I have (and this is just my personal preference) is that she does not have a body type that I aspire to have. She is much to manly looking for me- her abs are almost too muscular, from the side she looks 3-4 months pregnant, it's really weird. I actually think the girls in the video behind her have nicer looking bodies. That being said, the exercises in the video are good and you have 3 levels you can follow (beginner, intermediate, and advanced, demonstrated by the instructor and her 2 helpers), so this is a great DVD for all fitness levels. The program is broken down into 4 eight minute ab routines, Pilates abs, Core training, Classic abs, and Abs on the ball. I don't have a balance ball yet, so I haven't actually worked out to that segment, although I did watch it. All the segments have some common moves with twists in them, so it isn't boring and it does make you start to sweat, even in a short amount of time. At the beginning and end of each segment is a warm-up and cool-down that totals 4 minutes. So, if you do one whole segment it's a 12 minute workout. Overall I would say that this video is okay, but it won't be one that I use as often as some of my others, to be honest, I think I get an even better ab workout by just doing some of my other Pilates DVD's, but I'll keep this in the rotation, just for a change of pace here and there.",1314403200,,1635,4.226837060702875
8107472,5,B000E8N5DW,"I love it, you can do one segment about 12 minutes or all 4 and a cool down.  When time is an issue you have choices.  Chris is fantastic, not like many exercise video queens that make you sick of hearing their chatter, everything she says drums in the correct way to benefit from the move you're trying to master.  I love all of prevention DVDs, Chris knows her stuff.",1300147200,2,369,4.242857142857143
8107473,5,B000E8N5DW,"These exercises are not really anything new, but they are effective.  I like this dvd because I can put it in whenever I have a few extra minutes and get a great ab workout in.  It also is a great compliment to other workouts and/or videos.  If I don't do a lot of ab work one day, I'll add this dvd and then I feel like I get a complete workout.",1246838400,,346,3.8450704225352115
