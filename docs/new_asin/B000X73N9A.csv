8227049,4,B000X73N9A,"I like Playboy's TOTALLY BUSTED series a lot, and I got a lot of laughs out of volume 4 too. It's like a naughty Candid Camera, with people set up in embarrassing sexual situations and secretly filmed. It's true that this is not quite as good as the first 3 volumes, but the main reason for that is that Volume 4 is 8 uncut episodes of season 4, whereas the first 3 volumes seem to be highlights from the first 3 seasons. Image quality is quite good here, and in 1.78:1 widescreen. There's a good deal of nudity here, full frontal male and female with no censoring. Almost every segment has nudity in it, usually female. I do regret that Jelena Jensen is not as much on volume 4 as she was on 3, but I'm not complaining as there are plenty of hot ladies on this one too! Although I do wish they were shown more, or at least with a bonus segment of them posing. I would say this would be R-rated, as there's no explicit sex shown, just a little simulated sex, and mostly nudity.

There's a LOT of stuff on this DVD, about 3.5 hours, so there's no way for me to describe much of it here. One of my favorite segments is one in which the victims, a man and woman in their 20s, think they're taking care of an elderly man. To liven things up he calls over a couple of strippers while he has his caretakers film them. Suddenly the elderly guy passes out and his caretakers have to explain to 911 what's going on! In another especially funny one, a victim guy shows up at a yard sale, at which the owner shows him a garage full of sex toys that are also for sale. Two ladies pretending to be customers show up in the garage, and the ladies make a big deal about the toys as they strip, and strip the guy too. Suddenly the garage door opens and all the outside customers pretend to be aghast at the shenanigans going on in the garage. Another good one has a guy victim thinking he's working as a model for a photographer, and he's asked to model with another man and woman, with the photographer asking them to do wilder and wilder stuff until the victim gets so embarrassed he finally quits. Another of my faves has a young doctor victim thinking he's taking charge of a room full of patients in a mental institution. After a few minutes the room erupts in a wild party, with many patients stripping naked, which makes the doctor go nuts as he totally loses control of the situation! To me the funniest part of all this is watching the victims' reactions.

And yeah, there are a few lame segments here too, but hey, even then there's usually lots of eye candy! I recommend TOTALLY BUSTED 4 for plenty of naughty humor.
