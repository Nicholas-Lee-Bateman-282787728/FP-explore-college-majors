7912919,4,B00000JN63,"I had read excerpts from this book and had seen the video. I purchased this book to give it as a wedding gift as I found that many of these things helped me when I first got married. Simple things like allowing my husband to go to his ""cave"" when he is mad and not to chase him down with insentient words. It is a great book that helps you understand the basics of your spouse and why they react so differently than you do to life situations. It is written by a husband and wife and they have wonderful insights that everyone can glean some bits of wisdom from.",1290816000,,561,4.109090909090909
