5834525,2,B00DN9LAJU,No rabbit in the movie: false advertising!,1405728000,5,42,5.142857142857143
5834526,2,B00DN9LAJU,"First of all, I would NOT pay more than about $5 for this.  There are 7 mini-movies, and the most it will play is 3 at a time.  There are 2 sets of 3 movies and then one by itself.  You have to manually start each set!  So, it plays for maybe 10 minutes before my kids are asking me to start the next ones. Don't buy this if you're looking for something to play for your kids for 24 minutes, and it's definitely not worth more than $5...I'm not even sure it's worth that.",1402272000,,471,3.9263157894736844

5834546,4,B00DN9LAJU,"I like minions.  My kids are obsessed with them.  These are some nifty little low-key animations, mostly just to play around with things.

5834560,1,B00DN9LAJU,"I'm gobsmacked, what a waste of time & money even putting this on DVD.  Never been so dissapointed in my life.  6 mini movies and 1 dancing chicken.  Cannot believe that they got away with calling them mini movies.  They all last a matter of seconds.  Not even 5 mins each.  My 5 year old was so upset as he was looking forward to watching it.  Pls do not waste your money.  I only paid 3, I'm gutted I wasted that.  I'd be dissapointed even if I paid 50p.  Was not the effort of getting out of box.",1437177600,8,499,4.0

This is one of the few animated characters that I can actually watch with my sons and not question my own sanity.  Only negative is that the episodes are the Home Makeover, Orientation Day and Banana, same as the original mini-pack.  As for the Hop episode, its two of the baby chics dancing and that's it.  The Lorax one is entertaining.",1426809600,3,457,4.457831325301205

5834576,2,B00DN9LAJU,"Definitely a shameless ploy to take advantage of the popularity of the Despicable Me Minions.  There are 7 ""mini-movies"" which are no more than a couple of minutes long per clip.  The 3 Minion-themed clips are actually very cute and humorous and stand alone on their own well.  If you get this video, the Minion clips are the reason you'd want it.  Phil's Dance Party is terrible and feels like a tech demo showing how the computer can be used for animation - no story, no background animation, just two characters dancing inanely on a white background.  The Lorax clips are cute but are the shortest ones here and are just too brief to warrant repeat views.  I am not sure why the bunny from the ""Hop"" movie is shown on the cover, as there are no mini-movies that feature him at all.  Kind of unbelievable a major studio would so blatantly use false advertising to sell this half-baked collection.
If you love Minions and don't mind spending a few bucks for 3 short Minion videos, go for it.  Their clips are actually quite enjoyable despite their brevity.  Just know what you're getting and don't expect any value from the other videos.  Shame on Universal Studios for dumping such an anemic collection on us and especially for using dishonest means to sell it.",1420156800,20,1263,4.623318385650224
5834577,1,B00DN9LAJU,"Too short, not a movie format at all. My kids were dissapointed that movie night was over in about 30 minutes.",1419984000,14,110,4.285714285714286
5834578,2,B00DN9LAJU,We downloaded this for my son who is obsessed with Gru and the Minions.  Neither one of us found it funny and it didn't sustain his attention.,1419811200,,142,4.2592592592592595
5834579,3,B00DN9LAJU,This was a gift but I am told the entire DVD was very short.,1419638400,,60,3.357142857142857

5834583,2,B00DN9LAJU,should have looked more closely - we already have minion madness. Now we have it twice with a few extra shorts to go along with it...,1417478400,2,133,4.153846153846154

5834585,1,B00DN9LAJU,Don't waste your money. It's not a collection in this purchase. Single short film. Wouldn't but it again. Not worth it. Am I at 20 words yet?,1417219200,7,141,4.2592592592592595

5834588,5,B00DN9LAJU,"My 3 yr. old grandson loves these short clips. His original one got cracked so this was a replacement. If your child is too young to use the DVD menu, I would suggest an adult stay in the vicinity to keep these mini-movies playing.",1416614400,,231,4.2727272727272725
