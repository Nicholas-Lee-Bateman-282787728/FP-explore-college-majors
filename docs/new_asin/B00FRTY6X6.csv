8618390,3,B00FRTY6X6,"The biggest problem with this dvd is my own. That is, I do not understand spoken Japanese and I do not read Chinese. I am a big fan of the Manga that this show was based on and the manga are superb in their English renderings.
The English captions in this set are fine- but only for the first episode- and then the quality drops precipitously. It seems that they used literal English translations of Japanese idioms.
And they cut the number of wines they were looking for in half despite what the jacket blurb says. Problem with this is they cut out the ""New World"" segment which is what I was interested in.",1438387200,,608,4.342105263157895
