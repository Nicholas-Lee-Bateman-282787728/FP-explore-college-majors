Red Army Choir & Orchestra has taken the reins to bring the ""ultimate"" of full choral sounds, including classical suites and traditional songs...if you love superb vocals with rich and vibrant styles...25 selections plus two bonus tracks guaranteed to take your breath away...rich harmonies and the amalgamation of voices makes the music eternal...among the best choirs in the world...this DVD has it all.

My highlight picks are the ""CHORUS OF THE HEBREW SLAVES"" (from ""Nabucco""), ""BANDIT'S CHORUS"" (from ""Ernant""), ""SPANISH MEDLEY:AMAPOLA I VALENCIA I GRANADA"", Excerpt from ""BORIS GODUNOV"", ""MARCH OF THE TOREADORS"" (from ""Carmen"")"", ""NESSUN DORMA"" (from ""Turandot""), ""DE QUELLA PIRA"" (from ""Il Travatore""), choral, orchestra and dancers are brilliant with outstanding arrangements and excellent performances within each members sections, a must have for your music collection...every performance is remarkable, completely above all expectations...if you love the classics, this will satisfy your cravings.

The closing ""MOSCOW NIGHTS"" (Midnight In Moscow), always a favorite of mine and the Red Army performance has that special touch...then an added bonus feature if you click onto ""Season's Greetings"", featuring ""SILENT NIGHT"" and ""JINGLE BELLS"", each holiday selection performed in English and what else but Russian...very festive sending a warm greeting to one and all on this small planet we live on.

8044955,5,B00076ON32,This DVD is excellent! This is traditional Russian folk music and dancing at its best. Very entertaining! I have watched mine many times.,1335916800,,137,5.0
8044956,4,B00076ON32,"In the excellent tradition of Alexandrov, this is a great performance in a world class venue. The orchestra, soloists and dancers are magnificent! ""Sunny meadow"" and ""Kalinka"" were standouts in my book. You will see acrobatics that are nothing short of breathtaking! It is as if they studied the laws of gravity and took advantage of every loophole! ""Navy dance"" and ""Festival march"" get top marks from me.

All that being said, I would have liked this better if there was more Russian content. The Spanish, Italian and other content was not what I bought this for. ""Amapola"" was the one non-Russian song I did like. It was well done, still, not what I expected. Not a patch on it as the audience loved it. I was disappointed that they ony performed first and last stanzas of ""Moscow Evenings"" (My fave!) I also did not appreciate their attempts at special effects. The dancers needed none of that. It only served to blur things.

No need to be put off. This is an excellent performance.",1320192000,,987,4.666666666666667
8044957,3,B00076ON32,"I really do not understand the reviews and was wrongly influenced into buying this DVD.

Bad decision!!

1. The director should learn his job. Sometimes you see more of the upper stage than the actual group. Not to say that the lightning is very bad. It looks like an extremely cheap realisation.
2. The sound is terrible!! every break you can hear people's conversation in the background.
3. I overlooked the title list: The best songs like ""Kamarinskaya"" or ""Volga Boat Song"" are simply not there. But you have a lot of filling with musics from Carmen, Turandot... I do not mind listening to these, yet this is not the reason why I have purchased this DVD. Thank you! I already have a Carmen DVD. The choir's performance is very good, yet again they should stick to what we are looking for: Russian army music.

So the Red Choir is very god, as usual. But it is a very cheap realisation and a lot of their best hits are not on the DVD. Worse about 30% of the titles are out of context.

I have purchased today ""Red Star: Red Army Chorus and Dance Ensemble"".

Cross fingers that it is any better (cannot be worse).",1288915200,2,1115,4.419512195121952
8044958,5,B00076ON32,"i have yet to meet a cd or dvd of this ensemble  that was less than excellent, and this DVD is no exception, from beginning to end you will enjoy this one very greatly, I thoroughly recommend it  to all",1243900800,,202,4.025
8044959,5,B00076ON32,"I was looking for a Ukranian Dancing DVD and couldn't find any so I decided to try a Russian one. There was really no difference in the dancing. The singing was fantastic. My 15 year old has been mesmerized with this DVD.  She listens to it every single day. She even has gone so far as to learn the russian words to the song! After I bought the first one I immediately ordered this Red Army Choir one. It will not disappointed anyone.  It is just as great as the first one, Live from Moscow. No one will be disappointed in this ensemble. Singing is amazing as well as the dancing.  Kalika is a favorite as well as Moscow Nights! You can set them to translate to the English language in subtitles. I would highly recommend the two of them.",1232841600,,739,4.264285714285714
8044960,5,B00076ON32,"Great compilation but like one of the reviewers mentioned, I would have preferred more Russian content. Definitely a keeper.",1205366400,,124,5.578947368421052
8044961,4,B00076ON32,A good DVD with great music and dancing. However it would have been better to concentrate on all russian music. Camera work was not the highest & sharpest quality rather more an amateurish effort. Sound recording quality also not absolutely stellar. Nonetheless a nice DVD to have.,1123286400,6,281,5.0
