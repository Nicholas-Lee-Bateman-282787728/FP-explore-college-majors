1641802,2,B00005OCKY,"The basic idea behind GODMONSTER OF INDIAN FLATS is one of the goofiest ever. It could / should have been a classic of ineptitude. It would have been a masterpiece of pure idiocy, if only it weren't so bloody boring! I mean, how can you fail to make an interesting movie about a hideously mutated, killer sheep?? It's simple, you make a movie w/ 10 minutes of the wool-bearing critter, and 80 minutes of dull, unrelated padding. If GMoIF were a 10-15 minute short film, it would be a perfect example of brainless entertainment. Alas, the beast is only a (very) minor character in it's own movie! The rest is a story about a tyrranical mayor's attempt to keep a black man from buying property in a western tourist town, complete w/  cowboys and saloon-gals! Now, a movie this tedious requires lots of blood, nudity, or hilarious situations, none of which are present here. I bumped this up to 2 stars because the extras are both silly and bountiful, although I could have done without the randy sasquatch segment! Blecch!...",1226707200,2,1023,4.683333333333334
1641803,3,B00005OCKY,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever owned and I love it! This film beautifully portrays the racial conflict that arises in a small town and the people's struggles to unite and overcome a common foe. Whatever! This all about a sheep mauling a bunch of hippies and only Something Weird would have the gall to subject their loyal fanbase to this.  But then again, films like these are what Something Weird is all about. This is the Citizen Kane of angry sheep movies.  My wife still won't forgive me for making her sit through it. I can't validate the rumor but I hear that there will be another film about killer sheep coming out soon, but that may be a hoax.  Low budget trash at it's finest.  The extras on the disc are great as well and makes for a perfect background accomplice to any dinner party.",1174435200,,817,4.3202614379084965
1641804,2,B00005OCKY,"There are so many factors that this film has that make it a tue b-movie and cult film alike. There is one major drawback; it is sooooo boring. I mean, its got all the bad acting, the wierd plot, and wacky occurances that make b-movies great for those of us who love them; yet it fails to deliver something that you will want to watch again after you see it. That is, if you can even get through it the first time.",1102896000,3,413,4.048780487804878
1641805,5,B00005OCKY,"Wow. That is all I can really say. I thought I had seen it all, but was I ever wrong. Memo to all who think Ed Wood is the worst film maker in history: There's a new kid in town and his name is Fredric Hobbs. Brought to us by the always helpful people at Something Weird, this is the story of a Wild West tourist and mining town terrorized by an eight foot tall mutant sheep which emits orange gaseous vapors (and may cause viewers to do the same.) This movie has it all: incredibly stupid monster (with divergent leg lengths and mange); racist mayor; mad doctors; and hippies. How could you possibly go wrong with this one? I recommend (for advanced bad movie viewers only) a double feature of this movie and the infamous turkey monster flick ""Blood Freak.""
Like most Something Weird DVDs this one has some outstanding extras including movies on fly and rat control (not for the squeamish), an over the top musical number (complete with fan dancers and a saxophonist who looks like Che Guevera) performing a little musical nightmare titled ""You Cannot Fart Around With Love"" (also from director Fredric Hobbs), an extremely low budget student film called ""The Geek"" about the sex life of the Sasquatch, and (finally) a little piece of tripe called ""Passion in the Sun"", which could only aspire to have the production values of Doris Wishman.
Kudos to Something Weird Video! Anyone who loves truly rank and silly cinema owes it to themselves to snap this ultra obscurity up with all due haste!",1075507200,10,1493,4.637735849056604
1641806,1,B00005OCKY,"I love cult films and Something Weird usually delivers the goods, but this movie is boring. Aside from the hook of a giant mutant sheep, the film is tedious and depressing. The extras are pretty lame too. One of the shorts features a woman being explicitly raped by a sasquatch, which the cover fails to mention so keep impressionable eyes far away. Avoid this DVD like the plague!",1057881600,,381,4.617647058823529
1641807,4,B00005OCKY,"The prospect of a low-budget horror film involving an eight-foot-tall mutant sheep probably doesn't inspire patronage from mainstream movie fans, but it's surprisingly competent and features far too little of its title beastie. Director had the temerity to name it ""Godmonster,"" and his other titles (""Alabama's Ghost"" and ""Roseland"") are likewise wonders to behold. The DVD features two creepy educational shorts on rural fly and rat control and the hilarious black-and-white nudie ""Giel and the Geek!""",1007251200,4,503,5.631578947368421
1641808,4,B00005OCKY,"They just keep coming.  These great DVD's compiled by Mike Vraney and his Something Weird company are simply loaded with wild and crazy junk.  The main feature on this one is ""Godmonster of Indian Flats"" which is about a giant mutant sheep creature (actually a man in a suit) on the loose in the wild west.  Unfortunately, the premise and concept SOUND a lot campier than the movie actually is.  There's lots of western action and drama before we even get to the ""godmonster"", but when that sheep creature is on screen, all is forgiven.  Your eyes will not believe what they're seeing.  A real hoot.  There's some excellent moments of bizarro weirdness, but overall, the movie is kind of slow and blah.  Worth a look, but don't expect Ed Wood material.  Director Hobbs also was responsible for ""Alabama's Ghost"" which was once released on VHS by Thriller Video.  That movie suffered from the same mix of weirdness and tedium.  Keep your ffwd button handy.
However, the rest of the DVD is jam-packed with delights, as usual.  There's a second bonus feature ""Passion in the Sun"" (aka ""Girl and the Geek"") which is a ridiculous 1964 nudie-cutie.  A chunky stripper gets kidnapped by some crooks, but escapes in the woods.  On the run, she decides to stop to go skinny-dipping.  Then she puts her bra back on and sunbathes.  Then she takes her clothes off again to walk around the woods.  Then she sees the men following her and gets dressed again.  Then a circus geek who escaped from a carnival attacks her and rips off her top again.  The geek chases her and she ends up at the amusement park riding the Wild Mouse ride, the geek in hot pursuit.  She screams and screams and screams (usually her mouth isn't even open --- it's all post-dubbed)!  Lots of shots of the Wild Mouse going up and down hills.  The geek falls off the tracks when her car hits him.  The end.  Hilarious!
Other gems on this DVD are a short called ""The Geek"" which is about a horny Bigfoot creature who attacks some hippie campers in the woods.  He abuses and ""ABUSES"" one of the girls (she likes it) and then the men fight him off.  Not for the kiddies, but oh so very very very bad.  Then we have some hilarious authentic shorts dealing with rat control and fly control!  The rat control short is a step by step instructional piece for farmers and other home-owners how to keep their place clean of rats.  If you want to see rats get snapped to death in rat-traps or watch them convulse and flip around after ingesting poison, this one's FOR YOU!!!  Very exciting stuff!  Rounding out the line-up is a musical scene from Hobbs' other film ""Roseland"" which looks like a riot.  The number is ""You Can't Fart Around With Love"".  OK.  Then we get the usual and fun radio spots/exploitation art line-up.
What more can you ask for?  These SW DVD's are loaded, reasonably priced and deliver hours of cheesy, sleazy and hilarious delights.",1007164800,6,2905,4.563953488372093
7949132,5,B00005OCKY,"Stunning. One of the oddest films I've ever seen. There's this sleazy town, see? And it's Virginia City, Nevada (which must not have made the actual residents there very happy). It's an incredibly sleazy townall the officials are engaged in petty theft, and everyone dresses in costumes from the old west, including the hookers. There's one nice person, a Basque shepherd who for some reason doesn't realize the rest of the town is sleazy, though he's lived there all his life.

Then there's a university scientist who, with his assistant, is conducting some sort of research. The shepherd, the scientist, and the assistant discover a mutant sheep, and THAT's the Godmonster of Indian Flats. The monster is not very godlike. It's more pitiful than anything else, loping around, whining, its malformed appendages dangling uselessly at its side.

Then there's a business deal gone sour, and some nonsense about setting up a trust fund to preserve the historic nature of Virginia City, which is a scam because the mayor is sleazy. And a little romantic interest plot.

The movie sounds like a low budget shytefest, and while it is low budget, the cinematography is quite good, the acting isn't terrible, and the story is very complicated. The filmmakers were trying to say something. I'm just not sure what it was. But I enjoyed it.",1521849600,2,1329,4.95067264573991
7949133,1,B00005OCKY,"Is this real? Is this really happening? Does this movie actually exist? This...this is just, I don't know what to call this. I thought I'd never seen anything worse than Bunny the Killer Thing, and I still haven't, but this is almost there. First off some of the scenes change so abruptly that some dialogue is cut short before being finished. Second the Godmonster itself is neither scary nor does it show up until the third act. If you thought the costume from The Crawling Flesh looked bad, this deformed sheep costume is definitely worse, it doesn't look threatening it looks pathetic. Third some of the acting is just stupid. I can't tell if this movie is supposed to be taking itself seriously or not. I have to admit I did laugh at some parts of it because of how stupid it was, especially the part were the townsfolk have a serious funeral for a DOG THAT'S NOT EVEN DEAD. But the ending really ruined it for me so this movie sucks. If you want to see a good killer sheep movie watch Black Sheep (not the Chris Farley movie), it knows its a comedy yet it does a good job being scary. What a waste of my time.",1520121600,2,1115,4.339712918660287

7949135,5,B00005OCKY,"Because of the uh, monster that always seems to be focussed on (and it is a unique thing to be had by your ludicrousness-starved eyes), I had always assumed this to be a schlock-fest of the highest order.

Now don't get me wrong, schlock-eaters, there is a hearty meal to be had here, but there is a LOT more going than the average brain-dissolver in this film. The plot is an actual plot which jump-starts the absurdity to levels unseen outside of modern politics.

The extras are top-notch also, so if you are wondering why there's only one (as opposed to the usual two or three) main feature on this Something Weird Video presentation, fear no more and boldly go where hundreds of others (at least) have tread.",1506124800,,713,4.5625

7949137,5,B00005OCKY,Sorry to everyone who hates this movie. If it would not been found when mike did it would not be seen today. It was on the verge of being destroyed. Now it's one of something weird videos top ten best films. Ignore all the blah and blah about it being garbage. It's more of a out of body experience and worth every dime you pay.

7949138,4,B00005OCKY,"As a collector of really bad movies featuring really bad monsters, this is one of the top 10 in my collection.
 The sheep monster here looks like the hunchback of notre dame with several pieces of carpet samples over his back!
I give this movie 4 stars only because it's so awful it's kinda fun.
 The cast seems to be filled with (mostly) nobodies and lots of sheep and a few horses.  I have a feeling these animals, (if given the choice) would have taken the option of NOT being in this film in order to preserve their dignity.",1367020800,2,528,4.313131313131313
7949139,4,B00005OCKY,"Oh dear....and I thought Ed Wood and Coleman Francis couldn't be beat!

I first saw this mess-I mean masterpiece-listed on my cable TV's Free Movies lineup.  After all, who could resist not taking at least a peek at a movie that listed an 8 foot sheep as its monster.  Soon my senses were overcome by the sheer badness of this flick and its obvious question: why would someone think that a sheep, no matter how mutated, could possibly be scary?  (Same thing with ""Night of the Lepus--c'mon, monster bunny rabbits?)

The first thing that comes to mind is ""Where has Godmonster been all these years""?  After all, MST3K would undoubtedly have riffed this beauty if it had been available way back when.  Movie turkey books make no mention of this disaster (to my knowledge).  Where oh where has it been hiding?

In any case, disbelief turned to delight as I watched numerous stereotypical characters (a mad scientist, his pretty assistant, a controlling mayor, the local dumb but handsome heartthrob etc. etc.) go through a plot that somehow makes sense if you stretch the imagination a bit.  A tourist town out west which is looking to fleece the local mines as well as the customers, a weird misty substance that emanates from the mines and causes a malformed sheep embryo (how???) that looks like a huge pink beef roast, a black guy who is supposed to represent an investor back East (and almost gets lynched old school by the locals)--need I go on?

The plot does make some sense which helps one to muddle through this absurdity, but the monster--how to describe it???  Obviously a man in a strange getup that looks like fleecy carpet remnants, walking upright with a bum front leg dangling uselessly and representing (I guess) what happens when a substance having the ability to cause mutations somehow gets a hold of a developing embryonic lamb....you guys still with me?

I'm not sure if ""monster"" is quite the term.  The creature to me evoked more sympathy than fear, as evidenced by the assistant trying hard to protect and care for it.  It does chase away some kids who scream on cue and proceeds to eat their hot dogs (sheep are herbivores).  It also knocks over an obviously fake gas pump, which proceeds to cause an explosion.  But the creature seems more confused than malicious.  Of course, when captured the opportunity to make a lot of $$$ from putting it on exhibition is welcomed by the greedy mayor.  He obviously is related to P.T. Barnum.

(SPOILER) At any rate, the ending of this mess is confusing, to say the least.  It reminds me of the final scenes in ""Black Samson"", where the neighborhood rains down just about everything, even the kitchen sink, on the bad guys.  In this case, the projectiles include wrecked cars as well, and ends with the usual finale when scriptwriters don't quite know how to bring things to a tidy end--there's another explosion, which finally puts this misshapen animal out of its misery.  It also leaves the audience wondering what the $%^& happened?

The biggest mystery, besides the one that asks where this gobble gem has been hiding all these years, is why call the beast ""Godmonster""?  It simply makes no sense.  I guess no one could come up with something creative, like ""The Attack of Lamb Chop"".

But don't let these universally puzzling questions stop you from watching this messterpiece.  If you are a fan of the weird and wonderful offerings that populate the world of movies that go ""gobble gobble"". you owe it to yourself to sit through at least one sitting of ""Godmonster of Indian Flats"".  If only to watch a guy in a really cheap costume that is baaaaaad.  Really, really baaaaaad.",1331856000,8,3647,4.733755942947702
7949140,5,B00005OCKY,"If you like baaaaad horror, this is a great film to watch. The extras Something Weird put on there discs make it that much more enjoyable. For extra fun, plan a double feature of this and Black Sheep. You can't go wrong.",1317686400,,220,4.261904761904762
7949141,5,B00005OCKY,"I haven't watched this film in a long time, and now that I have again, I can honestly say this movie is laugh out loud bad (creature bursting into flames after being pushed off the cliff).  Something Weird Video has truly understood what dvd technology is capable of, and has released a horde of extras on to this one including the unforgettable ""the Geek.""  Once viewed, it will surely leave an everlasting imprint in your mind.  And Pest Control is still as pertinent today as it was back then.",1315699200,2,496,4.550561797752809
