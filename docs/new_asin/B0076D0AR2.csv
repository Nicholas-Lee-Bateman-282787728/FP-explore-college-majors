8510850,5,B0076D0AR2,Most history deals with victorious Kings and Queens. This is a rare story about what it was like for common people to live under those Kings and Queens. It is the story of people fed up with unjust government who rise up and rock it to its foundations. There is no ideology here: just a story of brave people pushed to the breaking point who would rather die fighting than live like slaves.,1403222400,,390,4.3561643835616435
