It is captivating; educational, heart-warming, real-life, and honest.
An incredible movie!",1035417600,,305,5.1
8507983,5,B000065B46,"This movie is well narrated and beautifully capturing the complexity of feelings and perceptions of parents whose first child was born handicapped.
The film maker revealed much of her own hopes and struggles, as well as the acceptance and love of her first born child who whose birth trauma resulted in his dependency for the rest of his life..
The stories of the fami;lies interviewed
 are warm and sad, and very realistic; they illustarte the emotional turmoil that follows a birth trauma and the process of acceptance and fight for the child's rights.
I strongly recommendthis movie for parents and relatives and special educators as an eye opener and very sincere account of parenting a handicapped child.",1035158400,,709,5.05982905982906
