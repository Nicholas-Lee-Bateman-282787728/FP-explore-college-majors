7788047,3,0314197400,"I believe this is the older version of Allied's test cram Dvd. I felt the first disc explained some of the tax concepts more clearly than the current iteration, so I am not sorry I bought this. Well, hey, I passed the broker exam on the first try. Yay me! Also, the demonstration of title and recording with the two stuffed animals does put a concept clearly into your head. You'll never forget who gets the property under what circumstances. The last disc had a practice exam. This is where I am hesitant to rate higher than a three - you need the most up to date practice exam you can find. This one is good in addition to others - but it's too old to be your only one.",1431907200,,671,4.1692307692307695

7788049,2,0314197400,"This DVD set was so boring I had to stop to check my pulse several times during the presentation.  I never did make it through the whole set, I think I made it to disk 2.  On the positive side, I did pass my broker exam even though the DVDs were outdated and incredibly dull.
The presenter was trying to be witty and entertaining but sadly, he just doesn't have an attention grabbing presentation style.  The graphics were also early 1980s quality and you could tell where parts of the video had been cut out and new segments added; instead of re-recording any part of the video they used censor bars to modify certain parts.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the original version of this video was shot in the 1980s.",1353369600,,722,4.406015037593985
7788050,5,0314197400,"The instructor John Henderson lectures on California Real Estate concepts for both the Salesperson and the Broker's Examination (over 8 hours total). There was a Matching Workbook that was included with the Software, originally. The 2002 matching Workbook may still be available, but I do NOT think that John's lecture requires a Workbook to understand it. The multiple choice Question & Answers are covered as part of the lecture, and may be seen by television or computer.

The more recent 2004 Workbooks & Software may be used alone or at the same time, because they both have the Questions & Answers included. Since the year 2004, all Software and Workbooks have been scripted by the instructor Dwight Norris to match each other perfectly. I own both the John Henderson's Software (2002) and Dwight Norris's Software and Workbook (2004 and later) and they are very good learning tools.
