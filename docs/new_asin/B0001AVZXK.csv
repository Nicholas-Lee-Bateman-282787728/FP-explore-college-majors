8009574,3,B0001AVZXK,"It's not that POWER PLAY is a bad movie...it's just, well it's just there.  Dylan Walsh (Nip n Tuck, Arctic Blue, Congo) stars as investigative reporter Matt Nash, a rather rugged newspaperman who can mess it up with the best of the bad guys.  (Until he runs into a senior citizen in the finale, who whips Walsh's butt...not entirely credible considering how apt Walsh was earlier).  Alison Eastwood (The Spring, Absolute Power) plays lovely scientist Gabriella St. John who discovers that a new source of ""clean"" energy just may be what's causing several earthquakes in the LA area.  The main earthquake sequence is not entirely earth shattering, but it's okay for an obviously low budget film.  The rest of the movie focuses on Walsh evading the nasty guys out to kill him, and trying to convince everyone that something is going on at the mysterious power plant.

Joseph Zito directs with a little too much leisure and the actions sequences become redundant.  Walsh tries gamely but poor Eastwood acts like she's in a stupor, which is not usual for this talented daughter of Clint Eastwood.
