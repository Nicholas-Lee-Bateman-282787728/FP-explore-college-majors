5539170,3,B00B04NJLW,"I was really looking forward to this film being a fan of almost all of the directors' work.  Unfortunately these shorts only have two notes - either to shock (a la torture porn style) or to be ironic, clever or funny.  Some of the shorts are decent but the issue I have, which I feel is a MAJOR issue with a horror anthology and given the talent involved, is that none of these shorts are SCARY at all!  I was only grossed out(which isn't being scared)or laughing.  Never was a feeling of dread or suspense or terror upon me (the closest would be ""D if for dogfight"").

I am still glad I saw it, just know what you are going in to see.  My favorite hands down, was ""o for orgasm"" directed by the duo who did the totally underrated gem ""Amer"".",1360108800,,742,4.190140845070423
5539171,1,B00B04NJLW,I had high expectations for this film. Two letters in I thought this film was going to be very good. Then it was all down hill.,1360108800,2,127,3.923076923076923
5539172,1,B00B04NJLW,"Sort of like porn only with poorer acting, worse cinematography and weaker scripts. The film industry seems to be in a race to the bottom and this film is an example of some of the overachievers. Are all the episodes bad? No. There's one that's kind of fun about a cartoon girl fighting off her own excrement. But most seem like film school efforts. Who needs it?",1359763200,3,363,4.432835820895522
5539173,3,B00B04NJLW,"I love horror anthologies but ""The ABC's Of Death"" is doing a little too much. Its hard to find satisfaction in 26 different 5 minute (or shorter) horror shorts especially some that are as bizarre as this bunch, I definitely would have liked some of them more had they been longer and I'm sorry to say but allot of the shorts are down right stupid and I mean stupid.

I really don't want to give away any of the shorts since they are only 5 minutes a piece but I will give you a few I thought were really below the mark!

""F is for Fart"" was so weird it almost made me stop watching, the whole concept was horrible and downright.....I don't have a word to explain, its bad.

""G is For Gravity"" was another straight out dumb short, someone drives to the beach with a surf board and backpack full of bricks, goes out into the ocean and I guess drowns? Probably the plainest short of the bunch.

""Z is for ???"" I don't even know how to spell the word given let alone explain what the short was about! All I know is that some Japanese girl had a huge penis which had a blade that came out of the tip, it is by far the weirdest short of the bunch!

Those are a few examples of bad shorts, others I felt were horrible were ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H"", ""K"", ""M"" and ""O"" but I won't spoil them for any potential viewers as I'm sure there's probably a few that could find them to their liking.

There were three shorts that really stood out in my mind as the best of the bunch, I loved the torture concept for ""L is for Libido"" which I think is the most touchy and twisted short of the group due in part to a young boy rape scene you don't actually see, ""V is for Vagitus"" which was the only sci-fi short and ""X is for XXL"" which dealt with an overweight woman who's tormented by skinny people. Those three were my absolute favorite, hell I would love ""L"" and ""V"" as full length features if they could be done right!

I did however find enjoyment or something to like in ""A"", ""B"", ""D"", ""N"", ""Q"", ""S"" & ""T"". Any other letter was just whatever to me, somewhere in between the good and the horrible.

I wanted to love this film so much but found myself making puzzled faces throughout most of the film, I would definitely recommend you see this just for the experience of it all but be prepared to see some of the weirdest stuff you've might ever seen in your life. I would recommend you rent this first, I thought about buying it when available but I'm not to sure just yet If the good really outweighs enough of the bad.",1359676800,37,2501,4.142268041237114
5539174,2,B00B04NJLW,"meh. i liked VHS for the most part. thought it was a good beginning at least for these guys to be doing these anthology horror films. it wasn't perfect, but i'll take it over this films sexual perversion stupidity fest. i was really looking forward to this film and can't believe i'm sitting here writing a bad review of it right now. there were definitely a few great segments, T, U, A, D, to name a few but overall, the abundance of sexual perversion just turned me off completely. i'm no prude. i can handle perversion for the most part. it just kind of grossed me out how much of it there was in this. like a constant pervert slap to the face. not into it. i hope the next one is more horror, less perv.",1359676800,9,707,4.205882352941177

Blu Ray Review
4/5 (2 discs) More than half the shorts have behind the scene feature and/or storyboards and animatics. With an indepth look at how at how the different directors approached their assignments.

The reviews said that some stories were hit and miss, but I still bought it and tried to watch it with an open mind. I do understand that this is supposed to be a mixture of the creativity of many different directors.. Man was I wrong to buy this. The movie begins with some random woman killing someone. Most of the stories make no sense or are too ridiculous. One of the stories has some surfer drown and we don't even see him. In another story some woman gets odd jobs to get her son a present. One of these jobs include stepping on a kitten. I pretty much grabbed the blu ray and threw it in the trash. Didn't even bother to.take it back for a refund. I'll never watch this and I won't even bother checking part 2. People should learn to categorize movies better. This film has no horror.

5539225,5,B00B04NJLW,"I found this in a Target low price bin & purchased it.  I find this to be a rather unique film.  Mostly because they allowed 26 directors, one for each letter of the alphabet, to do a horror vigniette.  It works VERY well.  They range from Horifying to humourous to downright disgusting.

Animal cruelty, child molestation, body horror, furry romance, coprophilia, vomit, torture, rape, miscarriage, misogyny, racism, Nazism, Satanism, drugs, senseless violence, all filmed in the most artless and clumsy manner I've seen. My brain shut down halfway through and I don't think I will ever recover from this film. 2 hours of my life were wasted, I got nauseous, and a piece of my soul died.

I really enjoyed this two hour plus 26th short film anthology. 26 different styles of film making, some are greatly better than others. Some are very disturbing. Some very shocking and some I have no idea what the hell I just watched.

That's the beauty of this film, is that you get totally different styles of film making. The Japanese segments are filled with some silly entertaining rides which add to the movie's weirdness and shock value. Some of the segments throughout are possibly some of the best segments in an anthology film that I have ever seen.

The letter A for Apocalypse is an eye opening experience, how they got away with the violence they did is just truly stunning, it is possibly some of the best special-effects I've seen done in a very long time.

5539377,4,B00B04NJLW,"I'll chime in and say ""ABC's of Death"" is a true ""WTF am I watching?"" movie experience. Now is that a good thing or a bad thing? That really depends on you. If you are looking for straight out scares, something that will have you running to turn on the lights as the end credits roll, then you may want to pass on this film. ""ABC's of Death"" is many things, but scary isn't really one of them.

If you are looking for a standard anthology film, you don't get that either. This film is comprised of 26 mini-films made by 26 different directors, each taking a word, and creating a film around that word in alphabetical order. ""A is for Apocalypse"", ""B is for Bigfoot"" etc. Some of the films work, some don't. I will say that several of the mini-films are pretty disturbing and unsettling. Some are funny, and some are so bizarre...there are no words (I'm looking at you ""F"", ""L"" & ""Z""!!) Despite it's 2 hour running time, ""The ABC's of Death"" is never boring. Even if you don't care for segment, it's only a few minutes before you've moved on to the next one.

I don't know if I recommend this film as it's clearly not a film for everyone, but if you like the bizarre, and want to see something different than the standard horror fare, then give this one a change.",1425859200,,1262,4.298319327731092

5539408,4,B00B04NJLW,"Most horror anthologies offer somewhere between three-to-five segments delivering on the promise of about half of them. The ABCs of Death is comprised of no fewer than 26 short films lasting a whopping 130 minutes. On that basis alone, the rate of return is better even if the lowest of the lows are outshone by even the worst schlock Amicus turned out in the seventies. Even more compelling though is the construction of the film; 26 directors from around the world were assigned a letter of the alphabet and offered the chance to create a short film about death with no limits on content. This is graphic, no-holds-barred stuff that should be avoided by anyone with distaste for same but for adventurous viewers it will be must-see. As can be imagined, the possibilities for violence and gore are endless here, as are the possibilites for tastelessness, cultural insensitivity and gonzo weirdness. On that basis, The ABCs of Death does not disappoint.

When it works, it borders on amazing. The film opens with a nifty gross title sequence featuring a flood of dark, red blood across the floor of a playroom on which sits a series of alphabet blocks. Shorts play first followed by the title of the short which invariably contains a letter of the alphabet followed by method of death. For example, the first short, directed by Nacho Vigalando is titled, ""A Is For Apocalypse"" but that title is only revealed after the short has played. This novel approach allows viewers to guess at exactly what the title will be given the letter of the alphabet currently in question and the mayhem they expect. This proves to be a more-or-less solid way to keep viewer interest and spring last minute ironies or sight gags.

Standouts include the slow-motion savagery of ""D is for Dogfight"" by Marcel Sarmiento, which recasts a man-on-dog boxing/fight to the death as a tale of comrades at arms. This short is extremely visually striking and not to be missed. In the incredibly powerful ""I is for Ingrown"" by Jorge Michel Grau, the camera forces the viewers to watch a murder victim die of lethal injection as her voiceover explains her last moments. Grau has said of his piece that is symbolizes the indifference of the Mexican government toward the mass kidnappings that plague the area. Thus, horror fans, who often feel they have seen it all, suddenly feel compelled to care. Horror becomes something other than a feeling. Lastly, ""Y is for Youngbuck"" by Jason Eisener packs a huge punch as a rumination on empowerment against abuse and psychological damage caused by same.

Two other outstanding shots type as message-driven. The silent ""P is for Pressure"" directed by Simon Rumley showcases the soul-crushing desperation of a young mother's poverty while ""X is for XXL"" by Xavier Gens deals with the psychological weight of body image on young woman.

Then there are shorts that are guaranteed to offend someone. The ABCs of Death has no shortage of these. ""F is For Fart"" by Noboru Iguchi, ""L id for Libido"" diected by Timo Tjahjanto, and ""Z is for Zetssumetsu"" by Yoshihiro Nishimura all contain enough penises, body fluids, pustules, and, ahem, exotic sexuality to offend or at least disgust all but the most hardened extreme cinema lovers.

Worth pointing out is how incredibly confrontational horror anthologies have become in the last few years. Up until now, the best that the subgenre had to offer was still pretty conventional in terms of content. Adaptations of horror comics were gruesome but within severe limits. It was not until Asian Horror like 3 Extremes became available stateside that the shift began to make itself felt with force. Even then it took a while. The last few years have seen the release of V/H/S and V/H/S 2, both of which are transgressive in the extreme.

Luckily, it seems that many filmmakers here had more in mind than making their shorts as gross as possible. ""H is for Hydro Electric Diffusion"" by Thomas Cappelen Malling is a riotously weird and entertaining furry fantasy involving a World War II era GI Dogface and a Nazi stripper locked in a battle to the death. ""J is for Jidai-Geki"" by Yudai Yamaguchi is about a samurai who cannot keep his giggles under control. Perhaps the silliest short is ""Q is for Quack"" by Adam Wingard in which the director bemoans being stuck with the letter Q and decides to execute a real live duck on film.

The ABCs of Death is for anyone who loves horror since it is easy to skip through segments that are not to taste. Any viewer should be prepared to laugh pretty hard; feel tense; get grossed out like they would at any halfway decent horror film. But that same viewer now has a chance to find out about some of the best directors working in horror today.",1422489600,,4728,4.772616136919315

5539457,1,B00B04NJLW,"Okay... The reviews for this movie are all either one or five stars, and I'm going to try to explain why that is.  First, a little background about me (trust me, this will help).  I love horror movies.  I love horror anthologies.  I like stupid movies.  I friggin' LOVE stupid horror movies.  I'm okay with indie films and subtitles and ""artsy"" movies. and I even like some torture porn.  My point here is I enjoy movies.

Got where I'm coming from?  With me so far?  Okay, here we go, then...  If you're like me, you want to watch this because you're thinking it's going to be like either ""1000 Ways to Die"" or ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents.""  Cool concept, right?  Like a bunch of fun sized candy bars.  Little short horror films.  What fun!

Turns out, almost no fun.  Yes, there are subtitles:  That didn't bother me.  Yes, the ""films"" are short and have a limited budget: That didn't bother me.  Yes, some of them worry more about being ""artsy"" than being scary:  THAT didn't bother me. Here's what bothered me (here come the SPOILERS, guys).

A couple of these were really well done.  If not scary, then creepy or funny (I'm a big fan of all of those things).  The overwhelming majority, however, were either completely over-the-top ridiculously stupid, and not scary or creepy or funny unless you're a seven-year-old boy, OR just horrifically disturbing.  I don't mean ""gory"" disturbing, I mean ""child rape and kitten killing"" disturbing.  And before someone accuses me of not being clever enough to understand the point:  Yes, I totally got it.  Horror means more than one thing.  Child rape is horrifying.  Mission accomplished.  I acknowledge that the point was to push the boundaries, or whatever douchey excuse there was for making me watch some dude masturbate while watching someone rape a little boy.  I felt about that exactly the way I was supposed to.  Still didn't appreciate it.  Raping little boys is not now, nor has it ever been, clever or artistic.

Anyway, there's that.  There's kitten killing.  There's endless amounts of poop and fart jokes.  There's a few where I'm convinced the director just set out to make the film as vague and incomprehensible as possible so he could be a condescending douche when people didn't ""understand his art.""  Remember that guy from high school?  Well, someone paid him to be a professional douche, now.  Dispersed throughout this disaster, though, are a few awesome little short films.

So, here's the take-away:  Overall, I am pissed off that that was two hours of my life I will never get back.  The bad and/or stupid far, far, FAR outweighs the good in this one.  If (like me) you don't want to just take the word of some random internet stranger, my advice to you is this:  1) Watch it on Netflix, or borrow it from someone.  If you hate it as much as I did, you will be furious if you spend money on it.  2) If you see that the scene you are watching is going somewhere awful or stupid, skip to the next one.  DON'T try to stick it out.  Child rape, guys.  Nuh uh.",1415491200,22,3027,4.595864661654136

5539470,4,B00B04NJLW,"Nine Things About the Movie ""ABC's of Death"" (2013)

1. This is perhaps the most unique movie of 2013.

2. It's an interesting setup. 26 directors from around the world were given a letter of the alphabet. They picked a word starting with that letter, and then made a short film about that word that incorporates death. They were given complete artistic freedom to make whatever they wanted.

3. The movie spans cultures, times, countries, and topics. Some are more conventional, and some are pretty extremely out there. Some are serious, some are funny.

4. The movie has been criticized for being too uneven. I'm not sure that's a legitimate criticism. We have 26 different movies by 26 different directors. Each one has its own style and technique. Now having said that, some films were definitely better than others.

5. There are some minor masterpieces, absolute gems, sitting in this infernal alphabet. Some are burned into my mind, whether I want them there or not.

6. I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but there seems to be a thread involving toilets, poop, or farts weaving its way through the films.

7. There were more giant penises than I expected.

8. If there was an award for ""weirdest film"" in this anthology, it would definitely go to Japan. Of course. No other country is quite in touch with their inner freakiness as them.

I don't recommend this to most people - it's pretty violent, bizarre, and it goes to bad places that no mainstream film would ever consider.  But for those with more... unusual tastes, this can be a good time.",1414886400,22,1552,4.736059479553903

Twenty Six Directors were each assigned a letter of the alphabet. Each based their short film on a word beginning with their assigned letter. Each short involves death in some way.

I won't go into detail regarding the specific shorts, but a lot of them go places I'd never been before. It's two hours and ten minutes of adrenaline rush. If you're a fan of innovative horror, then you'll like it. If you prefer more conventional stuff then you might be a little lost with this one. As always, it's up to you.

Some were tame, some funny, most vile and perverted- exactly the kind of thing that leaves a lasting impression on the psyche. I don't know if this was made specifically for American audiences, but I have to say that it hits every note of every single repressed feeling, repressed desire and repressed lifestyle of the average American, so visceral it was stunning. My favorite was actually 'Q', but what the hell are ya gonna come up with that starts with 'Q' and signifies death? Stupidity, that's what.

You have to be in a certain mood to appreciate ""The ABC's of Death,"" an omnibus film in which twenty-six directors from around the world have contributed a short - indeed very short - work on the subject of death, each beginning with a different letter of the alphabet (F, for instance, features death by fart).

At well over two hours in length, the finished project provides a mishmash of movie genre parodies and pastiches, along with live action, claymation, and animated sequences - and lots and lots of gratuitous blood and gore. The tones of the pieces range from serious and  unnerving to surrealistic and satirical.

Unfortunately, with rare exceptions, the quality of the segments isn't all that high, certainly not enough to compensate for the decidedly unpleasant nature of the material. So what we're ultimately left with is an ""art"" slasher film - a drawn out and not very entertaining exercise in self-indulgent morbidity.

I guess the whole thing is supposed to make us all wiser to the fact that Death, in its myriad forms, is always just around the corner waiting to pounce on us at a moment`s notice. Only occasionally - as with X, which deals, albeit gruesomely, with the issue of body image - do the episodes try for any kind of social significance beyond the purely sensational (L is particularly disturbing and R is simply gross).

As stated before, it's all a matter of taste.",1378944000,2,1407,4.793388429752066
5539577,3,B00B04NJLW,"There is something misleading about the tongue-in-cheek title of ""The ABCs of Death"" (which is of course inspired by the ""Ant and Bee"" books). The short films (each about five minutes long) shot for this death-themed anthology does not have to be horrors. Some of the works here are comedies (mostly dark ones) or bizarre, experimental stuff. You just cannot expect something like ""Masters of Horror"" here.

Like most anthologies, some pieces are great; some not so much. Segment ""D"" is all shot in slow motion. ""K"" and ""T"" are animated films. ""G"" and ""U"" employs a first-person viewpoint. Some are disturbing. Some are plain weird, especially three sections by Japanese directors ""F"" ""J"" ""Z.""

Here is the list of the names of 26 segments and directors who have contributed their pieces.

A is for Apocalypse (Nacho Vigalondo, director of ""Timecrimes"")
B is for Bigfoot (Adrian Garcia Bogliano)
C is for Cycle (Ernesto Diaz Espinoza)
D is for Dogfight (Marcel Sarmiento)
E is for Exterminate (Angela Bettis, best known as the star of a cult horror ""May"")
F is for Fart (Noboru Iguchi, director of ""The Machine Girl"")
G is for Gravity (Andrew Traucki, director of ""Black Water"")
H is for Hydro-Electric Diffusion (Thomas Cappelen Malling, director of ""Norwegian Ninja"")
I is for Ingrown (Jorge Michel Grau)
J is for Jidai-geki (Samurai Movie) (Ydai Yamaguchi, director of ""Battlefield Baseball"")
K is for Klutz (Anders Morgenthaler)
L is for Libido (Timo Tjahjanto)
M is for Miscarriage (Ti West, director of ""The House of the Devil"" and ""The Innkeepers"")
N is for Nuptials (Banjong Pisanthanakun, director of the original Thai horror ""Shutter"")
O is for Orgasm (Bruno Forzani & Hlne Cattet)
P is for Pressure (Simon Rumley)
Q is for Quack (Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett)
R is for Removed (Srdjan Spasojevic, director of a controversial movie ""A Serbian Film"")
S is for Speed (Jake West, director of ""Doghouse"")
T is for Toilet (Lee Hardcastle)
U is for Unearthed (Ben Wheatley, director of ""Kill List"" and ""Sightseers"")
V is for Vagitus (The Cry of a Newborn Baby) (Kaare Andrews)
W is for WTF! (Jon Schnepp)
X is for XXL (Xavier Gens, director of ""Frontier(s)"" ""Hitman"" and ""The Divide"")
Y is for Youngbuck (Jason Eisener, director of ""Hobo with a Shotgun"")
Z is for Zetsumetsu (Extinction) (Yoshihiro Nishimura, director of ""Tokyo Gore Police"")

5539578,1,B00B04NJLW,"My boyfriend and I settled down for what we thought would be some sort of kitschy short flicks, perhaps just cinematically cool looking if the story lines weren't all that great. What we got was a gore-fest. Which would probably normally be fine in context, in a longer movie for example, but it was just gore-y short after gore-y short and it was just an onslaught that I couldn't take to the point of it making me nauseated.

It wasn't entirely bad, some of the directors took the project seriously, but most came off as not even trying. If you are looking for a horror movie, skip this. There is nothing scary, and most of the shorts do not involve horror at all. More than half of these shorts are even comedic. This movie is just one big jumbled together mess.

I admire the freedom the directors were given to make what they wanted, but in the end, that was the downfall of the film. Too much going on at once, too many different ideas, just too much. This is a hard film to watch, and with the exception of 5-6 of the shorts, the rest were junk.

5539591,1,B00B04NJLW,"The excitement I felt about watching this may why the reality seemed like such a steep fall off a cliff. I like to believe I am a fan of both horror and short film collections, especially the combination i.e., Master of Horror. However, this one in particular misses the mark. There is so much opportunity for this to have been an excellent anthology of creativity and expression, but I think that the directors ran too far away with their attempts at artistic expression and put the movie itself to death.

While there were a few exceptions (A for Apocalypse, Q for Quack [although a mock comedy],S for Speed, etc.) The majority followed a pattern of attempts at originality and shock factor. Sometimes there is a reason why things are not generally used or depicted in film. Child rape doesn't make your film Avant-Garde. It makes it tasteless and disgusting. Is it a real thing? Yes. Do we need to see it? No. I think the final kill count for how many people where killed by toilets or poop was at 5. It almost seemed like some of these directors took this as a opportunity to get paid making something that gets them off. On the other hand a majority of directors tried too hard to be edgy and missed the mark. The movie became more of a guessing game of how unrelated the title would be from what was depicted. A great example was a film where a girl, being against her will is killed with a lethal injection. This was titled I for Ingrown. I'm sure the director would argue his case as to how its related, but most of the directors tried to be clever and artistic instead of giving it the appropriate title such as I for Injection.

Overall, this was a huge letdown. It had such potential and was such a unique idea. Next time maybe they should solicit entries and choose the most appropriate. I guess you don't stand out when you do something as clich as V for Vampire or W for werewolf, but it would have been a nice change of pace from the indecent and convoluted storylines thrown about in here.",1374451200,5,2005,4.430894308943089

I think the reason why not many will be remembered is because of the huge amount of material and not that they are uneventful.

If you like crazy films like Rubber, or have been exposed to Japanese horror (The Rampo Noir shorts,films like Tokyo Gore Police,etc.)then you will be much more likely to appreciate how these shorts don't hold back.

Some cheesy B horror, bat s*** crazy Japanese horror, some art house, french, scifi, dark comedy horror, you name it. For what the directors were given to work with you can tell they put a lot of effort into their little segments. The only 2 I had a problem with was G for gravity and M for miscarriage. Those 2 just seemed like the directors just decided to pocket the cash they were given and at the last minute before they had to submit their work just recordered something on their iPhones quick.  To me this doesn't really seem like an anthology film. It's hard to explain to but I'll try. Imagine a tv show like Robot Chicken or SNL. You get 30 minutes of stringed together 3-5 minutes skits of comedy. Well this is like that but a hour and half long and horror oriented. People are on here slamming it because of some of the segments in particular the Japanese ones and a certain one which leads the viewers to believe a child is being molested. They just don't get it. If they had ever watched movies like A Serbian Film, Life and Death of a Porno Gang, or Salo then they'd understand that in some countries directors aren't afraid to get a little bit more graphic with what they make.

5539612,3,B00B04NJLW,"26 films are gathered to tell THE ABCS OF DEATH, a Horror anthology that looks at death in its many splendid forms throughout a variety of shorts from around the world. Unfortunately, THE ABCS OF DEATH is a major upset that offers fewer hits than misses. While the themes and subject matter provide viewers with a wide range of different styles, it is perhaps too varied and inconsistent to work. A quick trip to your local film festival will generate far more interest, and it is difficult to dismiss the overall lack of quality based solely on the directors' budgetary constraints. While most have put a great deal of thought and time in to their brief segments, others seem to have been burdened by the entire process.

""Apocalypse"" kicks the series off with a bloody bang, then it's down hill from there. Angela Bettis' spindly short, ""Exterminate,"" is all-too-expected. ROBOGEISHA director Noboru Iguchi delivers something that is offensively tasteless and immature in ""Fart."" ""Gravity"" sinks, but newcomer Thomas Cappelen Malling then offers the utterly fresh and original ""Hyrdo-Electric Diffusion,"" which combines the Acme-antics of two furry creatures together with a tinge of Nazisploitation. Fast-forward to ""K,"" and you'll get a Youtube-worthy animation about a killer s***. Timo Tjahjanto takes one of the few risks in the series to bring us ""Libido,"" a shocking short that brings us back to the days of Pasolini's SALO. Ti West must have run with the money, since the aptly-named ""Miscarriage"" is a sloppy and uninspired mess. Banjong Pisanthanakun counters with a worthy piece of Horror/Comedy in ""Nuptials,"" where a trained bird spoils the fun for its master. ""Orgasm"" is too artistic for its own good. ""Pressure"" comes off as a rushes and inadequate attempt to recreate the controversy found in A SERBIAN FILM. And then, there's ""Quack."" Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett bring us the one film that feels like it fits in a sharp, witty, and purely entertaining short. Srdjan Spasojevic moves for a more meaningful approach with his own take on Body Horror in ""Removed."" ""S,"" ""T,"" and ""U"" can best be described as ""amateur,"" to put it nicely. Comic artist Kaare Andrews follows in the footsteps of Richard Stanley and Ridley Scott with his Cyberpunk entry entitled ""Vagitus."" ""XXL"" takes a stab at self image in Xavier Gens' bloody social commentary. Jason Eisener taps into his warped sense of humor once more in the mildly disturbing ""Youngbuck."" And the series comes to a close in the on-screen insanity that is ""Zetsumetsu (Extinction),"" taking the nuclear fallout of Post-WWII Japan to outrageous new heights as only Yoshihiro Nishimura can.

Concept outweighs execution when there is no guiding hand that is overseeing the entire production in THE ABCS OF DEATH. This experiment in Horror has generated a few noteworthy pieces, but on the whole, the anthology does not offer much replay value or staying power.

5539618,1,B00B04NJLW,"Upon hearing of the premise of ""The ABCs of Death"" I was immediately intrigued, although a bit skeptical - could they really work 26 different stories into a single movie effectively? My hopes were high though, expecting something like ""VHS"" or one of those `90s anthologies like ""Tales From the Darkside."" The end result unfortunately isn't just disappointing - it may actually be the worst horror film I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Honestly, something like ""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman"" is a more coherent and watchable movie than this.

Most of the clips are intensely juvenile, and of course there isn't nearly enough time in one to four minutes to offer up any sort of satisfying story. ""G is for Gravity"" is utterly pointless and might as well not have even been filmed, and it just gets worse from there. To know whether the flick is worth viewing, all you have to do is consider if you want to see something called ""F is for Fart."" The segment consists of the world dying because God lets off some atomic flatulence, and then a Japanese schoolgirl with a fart fetish spends her last moments sniffing the bright yellow toots from her teacher's behind. If that sort of thing floats your boat, then by all means enjoy, but I think it's clear the rest of the world can safely skip ""The ABCs of Death.""

Now to be fair I kept watching after ""F is Fart,"" thinking maybe this was some sort of high concept but low-brow execution of social commentary on how women's bodily functions are viewed in Japan. I shouldn't have. Afterwards you get things like ""K is for Klutz"" (sigh) in which a woman defecates into a toilet, the feces becomes sentient and refuses to be flushed, and then tries to work its way back into the uh, ""birthing canal"" it came from. Does that sound like something you want to watch?

The one that will likely be the final straw for many viewers though is ""L is for Libido,"" in which men are forced into a masturbation race to the death. The one who loses gets a pointy object shoved into in an unpleasant place. If you've ever wanted to see two guys furiously masturbate while a small boy is raped by an overweight man, well, here you go I guess.

So is it all bad and totally without redeeming value? Essentially yes. ""C is for Cycle"" is the only clip that's even remotely interesting (with a storyline similar to the flick ""Triangle"") but of course at a minute and a half it doesn't have time to go anywhere. A minute and a half of somewhat decent material just simply isn't worth the other hour and a half of non-stop awful.",1370304000,4,2562,4.515086206896552

5539632,1,B00B04NJLW,"I've loved many of the horror films that Magnet has been releasing over the past few years. While V/H/S had its ups and downs there is no way you could say that it wasn't a formula that worked in this situation, having several noted horror film directors make pieces of a complete story that interconnected. So one would think that their newest release, THE ABCs OF DEATH, would be a good movie too. Unfortunately that's not the case.

The situation is similar but more overblown. Rather than 4-5 directors this time we have 26 directors, one for each letter of the alphabet, given a letter and told to make a short piece involving death. Some run no more than 2 minutes and some longer, but each one is a miniscule time capsule where they allowed the director complete free reign to do as they felt and make whatever they wanted, no holds barred. That doesn't always turn out to be a good idea as is evidenced here.

Some of the pieces are actually quite good given the time and budget constraints. Some are mediocre which you might expect. The surprising thing is the number of terrible pieces involved here that seem to outweigh the good ones. Some even go so far as to be as offensive as they possibly can. If you choose to watch keep in mind that the Japanese sense of horror and film is far more outlandish and extreme than anything witnessed in this country. Gore and blood doesn't so much flow in these pieces so much as spew forth in an alarming amount as if blood vessels were connected to garden hoses rather than a single heart pumping the fluid through a body.

The more I've thought about this the worse the movie has actually gotten. I watched it last night and decided to let that sit a while before writing. Rather than make the film more palatable it's made me dislike it even more. It opens with a gory beginning piece that uses extreme make up effects to good use when the final punch line is delivered but doesn't remain in that format for long. The better of the pieces are found in the beginning of the film and from there it becomes weirder, more unusual, more graphic and more offensive.

Everything can be found here that would please those who seem to think that the world wants exposure to the worst forms of humanity possible. Freddy and Jason are child's play to the things witnessed here. Just to give you a run down of ideas here are some of the things you will witness in this film: Japanese girls who enjoy breaking wind, a women with a 6' by 1' thick penis that includes a giant switchblade sword, claymation toilet monsters, a contest where contestants masturbate while witnessing sexual scenes that start with a nude woman and end with a child being raped (not seen but inferred, still totally tasteless and excessive) and lastly a miscarriage turned into a joke (not funny for those of us who have lived through such a circumstance). I have no doubt that in criticizing such items I will be labeled a prude and told that I just don't understand art. This is one time when I find that more of a compliment than an insult.

It's not always a bad thing to have film makers push the boundaries a bit. It sometimes leads to some amazing films. The problem lies when they push the boundaries simply to just push the boundaries, just to shock or simply to just see what they can get away with. That almost always leads to poor film making, poor judgment and just bad movies as is witnessed here.

Have I seen films where worse happens than in this film? Sure. Find out about NEKROMANTIC of AUGUST UNDERGROUND and you'll discover what I'm talking about. While those to films have a cult/underground following this film is being marketed as a more mainstream film. Somehow I think that the neighborhood where this film is considered fun or entertaining is far past Elm Street, Mockingbird Lane or the neighborhood of the Addams Family. Unless you just have to see it or enjoy crap posing as art, then my recommendation would be to bypass this film as quickly as possible and pray that a sequel is not in the works.",1369958400,4,4043,4.508867667121419

Nearly all of the shorts aren't even in English, and to be completely honest I could of lived with that, if any of them would of actually been good. Most of the shorts don't even make any sense. To be truthful there is only one that actually stuck with me and that is letter T. So out of 26 shorts only 1 made a decent impression on me.

5539639,2,B00B04NJLW,"It seems like a simple enough concept--get 26 directors and feature each in a short film strung together by the loose idea that we're presenting an alphabet of death.  Many of these directors are up-and-comers on the indie scene who've made strong movies.  Some have even worked in much better anthology films (I'm thinking of V/H/S), so they've proven themselves with the short style.  But it all goes so horribly, horribly wrong.

There are, maybe, twenty minutes of good, horror movie viewing here.  There's about an additional ten-minutes of gore-hound heaven if you just want to watch torture porn.  But much of this is just truly horrible.  I admire the filmmakers for taking an international approach, and some of the foreign shorts (especially XXL) are particularly disturbing, but the Japanese contributions to the film seem like deliberate parodies of Japanese culture and television--like something South Park would do rather than legitimate movie makers.

*HERE THERE BE SPOILERS*

For instance, a lesbian Japanese school girl who wants to die smelling her teacher's farts and then gets sucked up inside the teacher's bum.  That, believe it or not, is one of the less ridiculous shorts from Japan.  The final installment, for Z, is so incredibly ridiculous that it seems as though it was designed pointedly to derail the entire film, except the film was off the tracks way before you get to that point.  An animated short of a woman who dies trying to flush an unflushable turd; some weird acid-trip for W, which winds up standing for WTF; and the incredibly boring, this-seriously-cost-5000-dollars-to-make ""G for Gravity,"" which features a POV shot of a surfer paddling out and then going underwater and apparently drowning, have already, by that point, sunk any hopes I had for the film either by being utterly ridiculous, boring (and imagine something only five minutes long giving you time to get bored), or, most often and the worst offense, just lazy film making.  There are a few winners here, but not enough to justify sitting through the entire two hours.  It does hold together as an indulgent art-house project, in the sense of representing much of what people stereotype art-house films as being (bizarre, plot-less, poorly made, ""message heavy,"" and mind-numbing) when they try to deride art-house films.

The style, content and quality is immensely varied, so expect the unexpected. With a 3 minute time limit it's difficult to get bored with this film, which at 123 minutes is pretty impressive. At the end of each story the 'chosen' word is revealed to the audience, usually to accompany an unexpected plot twist.

If you're a fan of more than one kind of horror film, I'd recommend you try ABC's. If you think good horror flicks only come in one or two kinds of flavors, then you should probably stay away.",1364256000,3,734,4.734375

5539693,4,B00B04NJLW,"The ABCs of Death is a horror anthology partially based on the Dark Forces novels and (of course) the classic ABCs children's books.  26 unique directors were given one letter of the alphabet each to create a short - some less than a minute short - horror film that must include at least one death.

Because this film was an anthology it is difficult to rate the entire production without mentioning its individual parts.  So, without giving too much away I will highlight what makes this film great and what it lacks...

A is for Apocalypse:  I can't give too much away with this one, other than we watch as a woman fails to kill her husband.

B is for Bigfoot:  Very creepy, and very surreal.  A man and woman tell a young girl about a creature that tears the hearts out of children who do not mind their elders.

C is for Cycle:  I really enjoyed this one, and can only say that it involves a man whose house is seemingly being invaded.

D is for Dogfight:  This piece was interesting as it could be interpreted two different ways:  either the main character (a man) is fighting a dog for money, or the man is actually a dog and it is a genuine (illegal) dogfight.

E is for Exterminate:  Here a man kills a spider that has been pestering him for days.  This one was just fun, and very reminiscent of many urban legends about insects that make their way into peoples brains through the ear.

F is for Fart:  Yes, you read that right.  F is for Fart.  Oh, what can I say about this one except ""What just happened?"" this short was painfully bad and yet it was hilarious and worth watching over-and-over again.

(As we go on with this review of the other lettered shorts I need to say that most of the films created by Japanese directors/writers were ridiculous and should not have been included in the overall anthology.  Most were pointless and more bizarre comedy than horror... F is for Fart was a Japanese made short, and thus ridiculous.)

G is for Gravity:  After F is for Fart, G is for Gravity brought the movie back to its intended purpose:  to tell horror stories.  ""G"" was a very good story.  A man commits suicide in a very harsh and personal way.  It was shot POV (point-of-view) meaning we see what the character sees.  We also hear the character softly crying as he marches towards his suicide. Very good.

H is for Hydro-Electric Diffusion:  Wow.  I could only term this short as a live-action-cartoon.  In it a female fox and a male dog - both, of course, dressed as a 1940's British Soldier (dog) and Nazi (fox) - have an epic battle that was both bizarre and rewarding for the viewer.

I is for ________:  I'm not going to tell you what ""I"" stands for because you can only truly understand the short (which involves a woman being held hostage in a bathtub) after the title has been shown at the end of the film...  ""I"" was very poetic and very unnerving.

J is for Jidai-geki:  Another Japanese one... I don't know what to make of it.  It was too cartoonish and too bizarre.  I'm not saying it was bad, just weird.

K is for Klutz:  A woman's poop haunts her... `nuff said.

L is for Libido:  A lot of the other reviewers of this film really hated this story.  They hated it because child molestation was strongly implied.  But, I did not hate it.  In fact it was one of my Short-List Favorites that I will include at the end of this review.  ""L"" told the story of a group of men who were kidnapped, and then forced to watch various sexual acts that ranged from erotic to sickening, all the while these men were forced to ejaculate to what they were watching.  The men were paired and the first man in a pair to ejaculate won, the loser was run through with a steel rod mechanically positioned at the bottom of the men's chairs.  Of course the men are being held against their will and are being watched by a group of masked (obviously wealthy) spectators.  Our ""hero"" is truly put to the test, as each display in front of him grows more and more terrifying.  I thought this piece was well thought out and ended just the way a horror story should end, unhappily.

M is for ________:  Like ""I"" I'm not going to tell you what ""M"" stands for.  This was the shortest film in the anthology - one-minute maybe - and is self-explanatory once you know the title. It was fun and fast.

N is for Nuptials:  I love this one!  Very funny ending, and a very cool concept.

O is for Orgasm:  This was the one and only non-Japanese short to be weird.  It was very artistic, but still weird.

P is for Pressure:  A poor woman is forced to make tough decisions to keep her family happy.  I am not squeamish but this one made me want to cover my eyes at one point.  Not because it was gory - and gore DOES NOT MAKE true horror - but because of what the woman did to earn a little cash.

Q is for Quack:  Very meta and funny.  I won't try to explain it, but it's worth a watch.

R is for Removed:  I honestly have a hard time remembering this one.  I do not understand what was going on, but it was creepy.

S is for Speed:  Two women are on the run from a hooded creature, but is it a run worth making?  This one was surreal to begin and sad to end.

T is for Toilet:  Rather than review this one I will supply a link to the full short that you can sample.  It is a claymation piece that plays on childhood fears of... potty training.  Here is the link:[...]

U is for Unearthed:  A POV... we are witnessing a chase through a dark wooded area where every turn could mean the capture of our main character.  This is a great perspective piece that lets us perceive what are nightmares see.

V is for Vagitus:  It is several years into the future and procreation has been banned.  One woman, an officer tasked with sterilizing and eradicating those who have propagated without permission finds a truth about herself.  I really liked this one, although it was more sci-fi than horror.

W is for WTF?:  I think the title says it all.  And although the titles are not revealed until the end of each short you will be saying ""WTF?"" as soon as it begins.

X is for XXL: An obese woman finds a way - a grizzly way - to make herself thin.  I really enjoyed this short and I believe that it may rank highest in my Short-List Favorites near the end of this review.

Y is for Young Buck:  Creepy, and pure gross-out.  I won't go into detail but this one was very gross in parts.  Like ""L"" it involved some child molestation, but unlike ""L"" other reviewers seem to have no problem with it.

Z is for Zetsumetsu:  There's no better way to end a good anthology than to end it with a bang!  Too bad we were left with ""Z""... It was horrible.  Stupid. Pointless.  I was so disappointed that this Japanese disaster of a film was made to be the last short in the anthology.  As far as I could tell some nuclear blast hit japan and made mutants that enjoy making sushi.  Also there is a woman with a penis/sword.  Very disappointing.

Okay!  We have formal knowledge of the short films and now we can give our approval or disapproval for the entire show.

Horror is a tricky genre.  Those who don't understand it think it's all hack-and-slash and gory scenes of naked people covered in vomit.  Not so.  True horror is a story wherein someone overcomes or succumbs to fear.  It is a battle between good and evil wherein evil is often the victor.  Horror is the story of strength.  When you're telling a horror story you are inviting fear into the lives of your audience, what those people do with that fear is up to them and in essence feeling fear is to feel alive.  The ABC's Of Death offered up 26 stories for us to sample.  The goal when finishing a horror story is to walk away thinking ""Wow, that was scary, and I'm still a little nervous but I survived it and I maybe learned something new about death, or life, or how to persevere,"" and I believe The ABCs of Death did that.  Mind you I do not believe they gave each letter a good story but they did create a majority of thoughtful nuggets of terror that I will not soon forget.

Watch it alone, and then watch again with friends.  I think some of these shorts were meant to be discussed with a group.

5539695,1,B00B04NJLW,"Almost half of these short segments are incomprehensible, pretentious art-school undergraduate crap that contain no horror and, for the most part, no coherent narrative at all. The worst offenders are artsy assemblages of slightly porny imagery set to a high whining buzz.

The other half don't fare much better. For a few of them, we get weird fetish porn for people into farts, forced masturbation, and furries, and when someone is forcing their fetish on me, shouldn't I be the one getting paid? I mean, these are horrific, but not in a horror movie way, more in a ""why did I just watch an anthropomorphic cat kick a bulldog until its balls came out of its mouth"" kind of way.

A few of them are a single crappy joke, told with little panache and zero horror.

Of the 26 segments in here, there are maybe four that are worth watching (B,U,V,X), four that that meet minimal standards of quality while not being particularly exciting (A,E,P,Y) and the rest are various flavors of terrible.

Do yourself a favor and go watch anything else any of these directors have done. Even folks like Adam Wingert and Ti West, who have made a few great feature films, completely crap the bed here. I would very much like at least 8 of my 10 bucks back.",1360972800,6,1240,4.572072072072072

The good films outweigh the bad, but don't get me wrong there is a handful of crappy short films in here (F is for Fart, G is for Gravity, M is for Miscarriage, Z is for Zetsumetsu..) but looking past those are some real gems (D is for Dogfight, R is for Removed, T is for Toilet, X is for XXL..)
