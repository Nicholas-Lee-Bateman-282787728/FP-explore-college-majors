8150051,4,B000JD4UG8,"Funny, bleak,  sad, absurdist  look at a day in the life two Dublin heroin addicts.  More `Waiting for Godot' than `Trainspotting' (to which it's often compared).  Two wonderful lead performances, and terrifically shot, with great wide angle images of our two anti-heroes - a sort of drug addled Laurel and Hardy - tramping through the urban jungle. The ending wasn't quite as powerful for me as I think it was meant to be, and a few twists felt a bit forced.  But weeks after seeing it, images and moments stick in my mind.  To me that's always the sign of a good film.",1272067200,,570,4.485436893203883
8150052,5,B000JD4UG8,"We meet Adam and Paul at the beginning of their day,desperate for a fix. What ensues are the farcical antics of a day in the lives of two heroin addicts and farcical it is with everything from reunions with old friends to run ins with gangsters and everything else besides....This funny,provocative,thought provoking movie breaks all the boundaries and that makes it great.",1189468800,,373,5.032258064516129
8150053,5,B000JD4UG8,"It's simple and beautiful. It's about 2 junkies looking for a fix on the streets of Dublin. Doesn't sound like much but the writing is excellent. The dialogue simple but thoughtful. It's a dark comedy. Not ha ha funny, but more situational funny. I'm liking Irish movies more and more. They tend to deal with real life issues. The actors aren't Barbie and Ken dolls and they can really act. Not for the average American taste, but a few may enjoy this film.",1182988800,2,457,4.518072289156627
