However, their publishing history is a pattern of publishing products that are sub-standard; i.e.: bad media transfers, no true restoration, misleading product statements (etc.).  You can find a developed business patern within the customer comments for the following film titles here at Amazon: 1. The Day Of The Triffids, 2. The Monster And The Ape(serial), and 3. The Lost Missile. I live near the actual manufacturer and found that they ignored ""all"" concerns & inquiries with each of these products. While I still own the first two DVD's, I did cancel the third title before being ""stuck"" with another poorly produced DVD product. If a trustworthy publisher issues a double bill with these two films together I will definately buy it...sometimes I like my ""cheese"" extra-thick too.  I think of it as ""Funny Cheddar"" or ""Funky Swiss"", always good with a toasted cheese sandwich and a warm creamy soup on a rainy weekend. BUYER BEWARE...""CHEESEY"" isn't the half of it when it comes to this manufacturer :(
Have fun :)",1312588800,9,1096,4.983606557377049
