Even now, years after I started with this series, I still remember her words and sometimes find myself adjusting poses based on what I learned from her. This series inspired me so much and it's what made me fall in love with yoga in the first place. My life wouldn't be the same without it so thanks Adrienne Reed and crew!!!",1389484800,,450,4.5
8183613,4,B000O76CH4,Works for beginner and intermediate levels.  Note some of the disks I received are blue Burned disks not pressed DVD.  Some users may have problems with them in their players.  Works fine in my 2 players.  Would give 5 if they were all pressed disks.,1357430400,,250,4.488888888888889
8183614,5,B000O76CH4,"I have been practicing yoga for over five years and own many dvds from several well known instructors (Rodney Yee, Shiva Rea, Baron Baptiste, Jason Crandell) amongst others. Other than a occasional pose thrown in most of them are the same. This series really challenges you. For the money it's like paying for 30 yoga classes and the variety not only keeps your interest going but it also challenges various parts of the body with every show. After completing her workout I went back and did some of the other dvds that were difficult and they were not only much easier but I got the technique down from her instruction. I also saw the physical benefits as well. My legs and arms showed definition that wasn't there and my belly dropped in size too. Went from a 40 waist to a 34 without a radical change in my daily routine and diet. I'm now starting the series over again but am starting at disc three just to change it up.

Excellent value for the money and you don't get the annoying commercial breaks that you get following on tv. You also get many good points that you don't get because of the commercial breaks.

Looking forward to the release of other seasons of her program. Make this series a part of your dvd yoga collection...",1338768000,2,1237,4.493333333333333
8183615,5,B000O76CH4,"I love Adrienne Reed's workouts!  This is def not a beginner level workout, but you will be able to push your limits.  I lived in an area that had this series on the local PBS station- at 5:30 am.  I got up every morning to be able to do this workout, and was broken hearted when we moved out of state and the PBS station here didn't have it.  I tried to contact the station where I lived to find out how I could get the series, but never got an answer.  I cannot say how excited I am to order this series on Amazon!

If you like a challenging yoga session, this is the series for you.  If you are a beginner, stick with it and you won't be for long!  Adrienne has a huge fan in me!!  I have tried them all...",1268697600,5,709,3.8680555555555554
8183616,5,B000O76CH4,"I was first introduce to the Power yoga series from watching a PBS station. When I moved, my new local PBS station did not carry this program, so I bought this. It has been worth every penny!

The set is the complete first season. There are 6 DVDs with 5 workouts. It's a six week bootcamp if you don't work out on the weekend. I'm a beginner in yoga and I like the challenge. For extreme beginners, I would recommend that Vol 6 bedone first and Vol 1 be done last, so as not to get discouraged cause Vol 1 is pretty intense. Keep at it and you'll see improvement over time.",1263859200,9,574,4.125
8183617,5,B000O76CH4,"I love this product!  While the series is definitely not best for beginning yogis, the short 30 minute sessions make it easy to fit yoga practice into my daily life.  The episodes provide variety for an at-home yogi for much less money than attending a studio.",1216166400,,260,4.630434782608695
8183618,5,B000O76CH4,"I bouhgt the Vol. 1, from the site and I got it this saturday 4/29/07, and I loved it, it has 5 different workouts, each 25 minutes long. So you can mix and match. The only thing is that it is not for beginners, it is for inter/adv. I am intermediate and I was hard for me. I want to buy all the Vol. because you have a lot of variety. If you know haw to modify to a beginner level, you can do it and work to the intermediate with this DVD.

I really loved it!!!!!",1177891200,15,464,3.783505154639175
