5903557,5,B00ECJWSTG,Great interviews and stories told by nthe people that were there. Highly recommend Top notch production and story telling A+,1381017600,2,124,5.25
5903558,4,B00ECJWSTG,Loved the interviews by former NWA stars.  Would have loved more full length matches from the mid to late eighties when I was watching wrestling,1379721600,,144,4.76
5903559,5,B00ECJWSTG,"Fantastic DVD, Bruce Mitchell and the rest of the guys do a great job in detailing a territory that a wrestling fan from Ireland like myself never had the chance to see.",1379721600,,169,4.3125
5903560,5,B00ECJWSTG,"GREAT DVD FOR ANY OLD SCHOOL NWA WRESTLING FAN.  SOME I ALREADY KNEW BUT GREAT DVD FOR ANY OLD-SCHOOL FAN, HOPING TO SEE MORE.",1378684800,,126,4.25
5903561,4,B00ECJWSTG,I ordered this DVD right from Highspots when it was first announced and I have to say that I found this to be an excellent documentary.  I was kind of worried about the project because I still enjoy the NWA and Crockett shows on DVD and on WWE Classics.  I just wanted to make sure they would do it justice; and the producers most certainly did themselves and the fans proud.  I recommend this as highly as I could.,1378425600,11,415,4.227848101265823
5903562,3,B00ECJWSTG,"Although very good documentary on the wrestling promotion,1 disc would have sufficed. The second disc footage was pretty good. I thought the 3rd disc was mostly rehash of disc one. Would have been happier with a cheaper price.",1376956800,2,226,4.973684210526316
5903563,5,B00ECJWSTG,"I was very pleased by Highspots' and Ellbow Productions' efforts on this. The documentary covers about everything from the  beginning until the end with a lot of key input from major players like Paul Jones, Jim Cornette, Rock 'n Roll Express, Ole Anderson, Tully Blanchard, J.J. Dillon and last but not least, the Crockett brothers (all 3 of them!). Diehard fans will know a lot of this stuff already but there were some revelations made. Jim Crockett, Jr. was very forthcoming and held back very little except when it came to listing Dusty Rhodes ""faults"" as he called them. Clips from Rhodes' previous shoot with RF video are included as well as Ric Flair's shoot with Highspots from 2008.

The extras are not just throw away clips but give us some really good extra stuff like Ronnie Garvin explaining why he left when he did, Bill Eadie tells a good story about refusing to do the honors for Magnum TA and J.J. Dillon gives a tour of his memorabilia. Jim Cornette also tells some good stories. I do get a kick out of Tully telling his story about leaving again and acting like it's a big revelation. If you've watched his other interviews including WWE's Horsemen DVD he has told that story countless times! The George Pantas match footage is fine for what it is, but it's mostly just some edited short clips from back in the 70s.

If you were disappointed with the quality of the Dynamite Kid documentary you won't be with this one. Complaints about that were apparently taken seriously and corrected in this documentary. It's very much in the WWE style which ironically is a good thing when it comes to DVDs like this.",1376265600,6,1625,4.635416666666667

5903581,5,B00ECJWSTG,"This was a very well done 3-DVD set by Highspots.  It was so great to see a great pro wrestling DVD set that has no involvement from the WWE.  Since the WWE owns all of the old NWA footage, they were able to get some great footage of some matches from a fan in Virginia from the late 70's and early 80's.  Jim Crockett Promotions produced the best professional wrestling ever.  I grew up watching Mid-Atlantic Wrestling and never missed a show every Saturday on TV.  I never was a fan of the WWF/WWE as it always came across as cartoonish to me (even as a kid).  Mid-Atlantic Wrestling had the best wrestling talents ever and this set includes interviews with a lot of these legends: Jimmy Valiant, Paul Jones, referee Tommy Young, Ivan Koloff, Baby Doll, Magnum T. A., Tully Blanchard, Ole Anderson, Rock 'N' Roll Express, Bill Eadie, Ronnie Garvin, Abe Jacobs, Jim Cornette, J. J. Dillon, and Don Kernodle.  It was great to see all three Crockett brothers (Jim, David, and Jackie Crockett) talk about the history of Jim Crockett Promotions, which was started by their father Jim Crockett Sr. back in the 1930's.  The bonus interviews and matches on discs 2 & 3 were very fun to watch as well.  The wrestlers told some great stories in these interviews.",1383177600,11,1254,4.5874439461883405
5903582,5,B00ECJWSTG,"From 1988 to 2001, World Championship Wrestling was one of the biggest wrestling promotions on the planet but it had to evolve from somewhere & that was Jim Crockett Promotions which at one time was the top territory for the National Wrestling Alliance for decades & this is their complete story that hasn't been told before through the eyes of various people including Jim Crockett Jr., PW Torch's Bruce Mitchell, George South, Jim Cornette, J.J. Dillion, David Crockett, historian Mike Mooneyham, Jackie Crockett, Ole Anderson, Paul Jones, Abe Jacobs, referee Tommy Young, Masked Superstar Bill Eddie, Ivan Koloff, Tully Blanchard, Don Kernodle, Jimmy Valant, Magnum T.A., Rock N' Roll Express, Baby Doll, Ronnie Garvin and archival interviews from Dusty Rhodes & Arn Anderson & Ric Flair.

The documentary begins talking about people talking about the type of man Jim Crockett Sr. was in terms of how he was a man of his word & respected the fans even down to the type of car he drives before going into how the promotion was labeled as a tag team territory followed by how the death of ""Big Jim"" effected the company behind the scenes.  George Scott becoming the booker was talked about next as far as how the territory changed from tag teams to singles & many of the new talents being brought in that would become staples of the company including the impact of Johnny Valentine before going into the infamous air plane crash with Flair telling a funny story about why the hospital called 911 when one of the boys came to see him afterwords & how the business moved on with more names being brought in.  The story being their wrestling being branded ""Mid-Atlantic"" was heavily discussed next revisiting some of the important feuds & discussing the different bookers before talking about how Dusty Rhodes had the ability to think outside the box leading to creation of Starrcade along with varied opinions about the talent he brought in & the idea of how he spent as much as he gained.  ""Black Saturday"" was discussed with details of how it happened & how the company ""paid for WrestleMania"" to get the time slot back before going into how being on TBS changed the company as a whole followed by the importance of the 4 Horsemen & the story behind how Magnum T.A.'s accident had a heavy impact on the promotion.  One of the biggest discussions occurred next as far as talking about the expansion of the company from the The Wrestling Network to the positives & negatives of the UWF buyout from Bill Watts to how many people say that they were more focused on trying to do what Vince McMahon was doing instead of just the wrestling business before going into details of what caused the eventual downfall of the promotion with such details being brought up such as moving the locations for their big events away from their traditional locations & other factors for the events not drawing along with how their business structure was unable to handle everything they were doing with people reflecting on who they felt was responsible for the downfall.

DVD extras include outtakes such as people discussing the ""Dusty Finish"" & if it was good or bad for business along with the thought of if what Dusty did what was best for himself or the company, thoughts on the big live events such as the first Clash Of The Champions & Crockett Cup & Great American Bash tour, the formation of the United States Championship, a look at the J.J. Dillion & Jim Cornette's Walls Of Fame, and trailers for this project.  Also include are extended interviews with the talents talking about various subjects including Ole Anderson's uncensored feelings towards Vince McMahon & Ric Flair, Paul Jones on how he went from a wrestler to a manager, Jackie Crockett on the story behind calling Jimmy Valant's wife ""Big Mama"", why J.J. Dillion considers himself the luckiest man alive, what is Magnum T.A.'s career highlight, Masked Superstars reaction to when he was brought in to face Magnum T.A., Tommy Young's memories from the Clash Of The Champions, how Baby Doll got the job of being ""The Perfect 10"", Tully Blanchard's story of why he left & never came back to JCP, how Jimmy Valant became ""The Boogie Woogie Man"", Ronnie Garvin on his infamous heel turn & how he ""blew up"" his bridge when leaving the promotion, Ricky Morton & Robert Gibson's memories of the ""Rock N' Roll Express Super Summer Sizzler Tour"", Ivan Koloff's inspirational story of becoming a born again Christian, Jim Cornette's Starrcade memories, how Don Kernodle met Sgt. Slaughter, and a one hour interview with Jim Crockett Jr.

When I reviewed WWE's ""Rise & Fall Of WCW"", I made it clear that I thought they rushed through the history of Jim Crockett Promotions when they had the time & opportunity to do it but this presentation did do that promotion justice as they didn't go into details or waste a bunch of time on facts & feuds that the general wrestling fan would already know about but spend that time going into more details of stuff that we didn't already know about.  In the end, I recommend this for anyone who was a fan of that time period or want to know more about the origins of the company that they would know later on to be WCW.",1383091200,5,5200,4.711771177117712

8603905,5,B00ECJWSTG,Great documentary! Had no idea David Crockett blames Dusty Rhodes for the fall of the company instead of his brother where it belongs. Still the best promotion of all time.,1472256000,,172,4.766666666666667
8603906,4,B00ECJWSTG,"Considering what they had to work with, this Documentary turned out quite well. The fan footage added so much to the presentation and acts as a first hand account of how great the Mid-Atlantic roster really was. The full interviews are even better than the documentary. Jim Cornette is a great storyteller. Everybody is informative and nobody holds back. The Crockett's are frank, candid and unapologetic, especially Jackie, who comes off like a real jerk. There is quite a bit of Dusty Rhodes bashing, especially by Ronnie Garvin and Dusty's archive interview doesn't show him the best light. So be warned if you love ""The Dream,"" and who doesn't. Ivan Koloff talks way too much about his Christianity. Here's why I didn't give it a fifth star, the production and packaging are about as amateur as it gets. I could do better editing with a cheap Windows Movie Maker program. My biggest beef is the packaging, nothing is labeled! I liked the photos, but it would be nice to have some kind of printed guide to what features are on what disc. Even the disc themselves aren't labeled with anything except the title. Is this Disc 1, 2 or 3.",1472169600,2,1136,4.685

8603910,4,B00ECJWSTG,Classic stuff.  If you're familiar with Jim Crockett Promotions.....there's nothing else that needs to be said.  Add this to your collection.,1439942400,,141,5.666666666666667
