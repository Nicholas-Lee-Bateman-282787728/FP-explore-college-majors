2857254,5,B000R349GQ,Don't ever underestimate the resolve of this woman to get to the truth.  Patricia Routledge shows her range as a performer in this role that is the antithesis of Hyacinth Bucket...and she can really sing on pitch!,1220659200,4,213,4.756756756756757
2857255,5,B000R349GQ,"This series is great fun. I was introduced to Patricia Routledge from her role as Hyacinth Bucket in ""keeping Up Appearances"". Her role in this series is somewhat similar but more enjoyable as she plays a more sympathetic, and less overtly humorous role. This series is more dramatic in nature, in the tradition of a heartwarming English cozy.",1220486400,3,343,4.931034482758621
2857256,5,B000R349GQ,This complete collection includes the 1st episode where Hetty gets her start as a private eye.  It is interesting to see how the series progresses.  The first few episodes are much darker.  If you are a fan of Hetty Wainthropp and the marvelous Patricia Routledge you will love this collection.,1199577600,9,294,4.84
2857257,5,B000R349GQ,"Patricia Rutledge is a British jewel.  The quality of the picture was good but the only complaint I have is that it si very difficult to remove the discs from the package. As I viewed each disc, I put it in another container. Whether she is doing comedy or serious parts, this lady is worth the price of admission",1191456000,31,313,4.305084745762712
2857278,5,B000R349GQ,Great video series!,1507680000,,19,5.666666666666667
2857279,4,B000R349GQ,"This is a detective sitcom. It has all the charm of small criminal cases that deal with no murders or crimes of that type, but only with small crimes in local neighborhoods in Lancashire and from time to time a little bit in Yorkshire.

The main interest is the family background of the characters. Hetty and Robert Wainthropp are two older citizens who have reached retirement age but would find it difficult to go on living in good conditions on their two pensions. So they look for extra-activities. They start a private detective business and lead us into some squalid, sordid or simply sorry situations of hatred and jealousy, envy and rivalry, small demeanors and traffic. Though they do not do drugs. Later on Robert Wainthropp will manage to get a regular column in the tabloid.

But the producers wanted to change the situation from what it was in the previous fabulously popular series with the same main actress, Keeping Up Appearances. In both cases, the son of the married couple (forty years of marriage) was away from the family home and a younger man and eventually a young couple were needed to open them up to the younger generations and their problems.

So Hetty Wainthropp selects a hardly of age young man who is more or less unemployed and trying to get away from his possessive mother who seems to be an alcoholic or something of the sort. Hetty and her husband Robert will make him an associate, a partner in the business soon after.

And then this young man who is as virginal as a lily will soon get in touch with a female mechanic who will sell him a second-hand car when he finally gets his license. And with some ups and downs, they will slowly move into a relationship, one apartment, and a future common life.

The criminal cases are there to show how disrupted the English society is up north. We are twenty years ago and you will then understand why they voted for Brexit. Closed upon their communities that are very small, with a lot of underground black market economy that is half criminal and half illegal. It is well known they could not accept European regulations that became little by little so hefty that people more or less thought they could not take a shower without paying an extra-tax and having to use no more than a gallon of water.

Not to speak of all sorts of marginals, gypsies or not, who are roaming around. And the police are just helpless most of the time, to the point of employing now and then Hetty Wainthropp to penetrate and infiltrate some dubious circles to get some information from the inside.

And they stopped the series marvelously after four years when the agency is in full bloom, Jeffrey, the younger partner, and his girlfriend are moving slowly towards some kind of an official relationship and after Robert has reestablished normal relations with his own brother. The family circle is slightly larger, though it looks a lot like a recomposed family. Parents in their older age are led to choosing the younger people who will be their side-kick children, and these younger people find in an older couple some sidekick or substitute parents of a new sort: mental parents and not blood relatives.

Frankly, who gives the slightest straw about blood!

2857300,2,B000R349GQ,"Not being a fan of ""Keeping Up Appearances"", I purposely picked the video series out of the library because I thought the stars of that series might be better off in this one, which was produced after the other show. Unfortunately, while it wasn't silly like the other show, it wasn't very good either.

The premise does evoke the stars' former show. They are an older married couple, with one problem: the wife is not legally eligible for a government pension because she had not been employed long enough, so she takes a job at a post office to fill in her missing working time. In doing so, she spots a teenage boy swiping a charity box and a suspicious couple cashing two welfare checks. She gets the box back and finds out how the couple were cashing a fraudulently-obtained check. She gets the idea into her head of being a private detective, over her husband's objections.

The show doesn't try for comedy, but it is slow-moving and dull, and the wife bullies her husband as she did in their former show. I was hoping for better. I didn't get it here.",1492041600,,1058,4.505208333333333

I'd seen a few episodes on television and remembered them.  But until I watched the entire series I really didn't know how well constructed and tastefully performed the series is.  There is very little traditional ""mystery"" here, no foul language, no sexual innuendo.  So how can it be so good?  Well, folks, it is.  A very unusual aspect of this series is that it can be shared with children, who may just get a glimpse of England at a most charming moment.
And it's such fun to see the awkward, gawky Dominic Monaghan grow in his role, showing a talent in its early development.

2857580,5,B000R349GQ,"The multi-talented Patricia Routledge (you may know her as Hyacinth in ""Keeping Up Appearances"") portrays Hetty, who embodies the advice to create a second career in one's later years. Her start in crime-solving is accidental, but Hetty, aided by her husband and a teenage sidekick (Dominic Monaghan), capitalizes on her luck and natural investigative skill. This series aired on PBS in the late 90s and wrapped in 04, leaving viewers wishing for more.( Alert viewers will recognize Hetty's Irish niece Peggy as the actress who played O'Brien in ""Downton Abbey"") Acorn's complete collection includes the series pilot, ""Missing Persons""  (in which Hetty's husband is played by a different actor, and her character, drawn to oversize hats, is more ditsy, less Joe Friday) as well as two episodes not seen in the US. The show's award-winning instrumental theme song sets the mood for a crime series focused not on forensics or wisecracks but savvy detecting and genuine interest in people. Visiting with Hetty is always a treat. Routledge, who has a wonderful singing voice (she IS a Tony-winner, after all) even sings in one episode, allowing fans to appreciate even more of her performing skills.

2857593,5,B000R349GQ,"It is wonderful that Acorn has chosen to re-release (with closed captioning) the terrific Patricia Routledge series from the mid-nineties: HETTY WAINTHROPP INVESTIGATES.

Routledge is best-known for her work in Keeping Up Appearances, a program which seems to be endlessly repeated, usually on PBS. Her Hyacinth Bucket (Its pronounced bouquet!) is a masterpiece of comedic acting, a woman who perceives herself to be much higher on the social ladder than she really is.

There is a thread that connects Keeping Up Appearances with HETTY WAINTHROPP INVESTIGATES. Hetty is a sixty year old pre-pensioner who simply refuses to give in to old age and the perceptions that society in general has of those who are put out to pasture.

Through an extraordinary series of low-key events, Hetty has an epiphany: she is meant to be a detective. At an age when most people are winding down in life, she has discovered her gift and is just beginning to live. She is re-born.

Adding immensely to the shows success is Hettys friendship/ mentoring of Geoffrey, a late teen who is badly in need of some stable direction in his life. It is a fresh take on the detective/ sidekick relationship that is made believable by Routledge refusing to play Hetty as a know-it-all, but rather as a nurturing caregiver who genuinely cares for her young charge. She is also passionately vocal about the role of older people in society and is not afraid to tear a strip off anyone who thinks otherwise.

Hettys husband, Robert, completes the unlikely triangle, quietly expressing his doubt at first but gradually becoming significantly supportive as he struggles to understand the needs of his spouse.

Theres a fair bit of humour mixed in with the drama and it is testimony to the fine scripts and fully-developed characters that the show balances the two elements with such deft.

All of the episodes are fine and some are quite brilliant. As the teams reputation grows, their cases become more involving, with season three being probably the best of the lot. It is here that some very notable guest stars appear, such as Ronald Pickup, Richard Pasco and Charles Kay.

A great example of the shows humour is found in the episode when young Geoffrey is being threatened by a suspect and almost thrown off a balcony. Please dont. I may not bounce! he exclaims.

Theres plenty of bounce in HETTY WAINTHROPP. It has a wonderful light touch to it while still offering involving plots and mysteries.",1397433600,91,2465,4.892086330935252

2857613,5,B000R349GQ,"Having watched Patricia Routledge for years as Hyacinth Bouquet on Keeping Up Appearances, I knew we were in for a treat when our PBS station announced the arrival of Hetty Wainthropp Investigates.  I was not wrong, and from the very first episode we were intrigued by Hetty, who at sixty decides NOT to fall into retirement, but to make her life matter.  She discovers that she is a Natural Detective (the resident scientist says ""busybody"" but I disagree.)  She is able to see through artificial behavior, to piece together clues and solve crimes, even grisly murders.  As is often the case with  PBS stations, the funds our station was dependent on were never enough to get all the good shows, and we missed several seasons of Hetty.  Now in this reissue of the collection from Acorn Media, we can enjoy every episode.  For fans of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and LOST, Hetty's assistant in her detective business is a youthful Dominic Monaghan.",1391385600,26,942,4.742331288343558
2857614,5,B000R349GQ,"I've only discovered this past treasure. My wife and I loved it, partly because we are Hetty-age.
When Hetty turns 60 she decides to account for more than a senior citizen> That role she rejects. She and spouse, Robert, are passionate, in love, sometimes with friction. Hetty catches a needy shoplifter teen, Geoffrey, and the stage is set for their many adventure--27 to be exact. Hetty loathes dishonesty and coerces Geoffrey to help solve mysteries of crime. It's not hard, gritty, dark, or bloody, but a family-viewable crime mystery series for all ages. Comes with plenty of humor with Lancashire country mystery and scenic views.

A Pvt. Eye team as heartwarming as case-successful.
Regulars: Hetty Wainthropp (Patricia Routledge -`Keeping Up Appearances'); Robert (Derek Benfield -loved him in the early days of `Rumpole of the Bailey'); Geoffrey (Dominic Monaghan -`Lord of the Rings'); DCI Adams (John Graham-Davies); Janet (Suzanne Maddock -""The Bill""). Tons of seasoned guest stars.

Closed Captioning for all episodes. Set includes a bonus interview.
This fun mystery/crime series needs NO warnings on the DVD box. That's a plus for many home viewers. Refreshing entertainment on the lighter, not darker, side.
Each of the 4 included series is also available separately, in case you already own some this complete collection. I included episode synopsis on the separate Hetty DVD listings.

2857618,4,B000R349GQ,"The Hetty Wainthropp mysteries are northern England, working class ""cozies"".  The indomitable Hetty, her husband Robert and her assistant and sometimes lodger Jeffrey (played by Dominick Monaghan of Lord of the Rings fame) are a detective agency that gradually earns respect in their community and keeps the viewer alternately interested and amused.  I like this show and it is very well acted and directed.  I held back from 5 stars because this is a bit of a ""light weight"".  If you enjoy English programs like ""Midsomer Murders"" you would probably also enjoy Mrs. Wainthropp.  Hetty is played by Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth ""Bookay"").  Don't expect Hyacinth.  This practical, down-to-earth housewife-turned-detective is nothing like Hyacinth. Hetty favors simple blouses and cardigans, comfortable shoes and plain speaking.  And the occasional Dubonnet after a tough day. I highly recommend this to lovers of ""cozy"" mysteries and all things English.",1375488000,4,953,5.524137931034483
2857619,4,B000R349GQ,"British mystery fans have been fed a limited, edited diet of ""Hetty Wainthropp Investigates"" on PBS. Fortunately, this unedited, complete collection contains scenes (and even episodes) never seen before. Viewing all in entirety makes a significant difference; a sliver of removed narrative affects the story. The only drawback with this series is that despite the cost of this collection, BBC failed to provide subtitles. This omission aggravates many ""Hetty"" fans; viewers of all ages may have difficulty discerning the narrative and various accents.

One of the best aspects of this collection is the special interview with Patricia Routledge. She is a commanding actress who owns her parts completely, a feisty & fiercely intelligent woman who hides her impatience with the (at times) condescending questions with grace. She is from Cheshire, U.K., graduated from the University of Liverpool, and came up the hard way through diligence, talent, and hard work. Many viewers are familiar with Patricia Routledge as the inveterate, class-conscious Hyacinth Bucket (""Bouquet"") in ""Keeping Up Appearances."" As working-class Hetty Wainthropp, in northwest England, Routledge is quite another character altogether. In the interview, she mentions Hetty's motivation to earn an income and pursue her dream of being a private investigator, despite prevalent attitudes when the show first aired in the U.K. in 1996 that people go to seed after age sixty (how young!). But the audience really appreciated an alternative view, and things have changed somewhat, though agism is still rampant.

Hetty's gentle husband Robert (Derek Benfield) patiently offsets her bossiness, and escpes to his garden allotment when possible, to grown huge quantities of runner-beans. He learns to accept Hetty's doings, and she even earns the respect of DCI Adams (John Graham Davies). Hetty rescues young Geoffrey Shawcross (Dominic Monaghan, famous in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>) from a pointless life of petty thieving and a dead-end job restocking grocery store shelves. Geoffrey becomes Hetty's assistant, and then the Wainthropp's lodger, more of a son than Derek, who lives in far-away Australia, much to Hetty's sadness. Hetty & Robert Wainthropp provide refuge for Geoffrey, escaping from his shambles of a family. These three make a delightful team. The best aspect of the show is the ""family of choice"" that Hetty, Robert, and Geoffrey build with kindly affection over time. But Robert's aggravating brother ""Frank"" adds little to the narrative, he's a bit of a misstep. Geoffrey meets up with an old friend at a garage (a very young Andrew Lee-Potts, later in the great series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Vol-1-Series-1-2/dp/B001D2WUGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval, Vol. 1/Series 1 & 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Vol-2-Series-3/dp/B002D1XKB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval, Vol. 2/Series 3</a>), and he falls for feisty auto mechanic Janet Frazer (Suzanne Maddock, a fine actor deserving of more rolls). She finally sells a car to Geoffrey, but their relationship is frustratingly fitful, another writerly misstep. The scenery is beautiful (more of it than edited on PBS), from England's western coasts to east; overall, this series provides a fun escape.

2857639,5,B000R349GQ,"Ms. Patricia Routledge and fellow cast members exude their joy for acting
...........and what a splendid job they do. I own the whole set, and I'm glad I do.
 Ms. Routledge exemplifies the 21st Century woman entering her senior
years with gusto and passion............to help those wronged in the name
of The Hetty Wainthropp Detective Agency. She tries to make things right
in a world of corporate greed, youth bullying, piracy and other misdemeanors
that appeal to her investigative mind. As she states quite appropriately,
""If this is a case of murder, it belongs in the hands of the police.""
She always states her terms and once understood, she, her husband Robert,
and business partner, Geoffrey take action to help solve the crime and/or situation.
The stories are played out by wonderful character actors. The plots
are not mind twisters as you would find with Agatha Christie mysteries;
instead, you are introduced to people of Northern England and we become
acquainted with their culture and traditions. Hetty investigates real issues
that people face on a daily basis. She gives her job a ""human face"",
one which people can trust. That is exactly why I thoroughly enjoyed
watching the whole series. I just wish there were more; but alas,
I'm happy I own these. Ms. Routledge is a supreme actor. And I would like to say,

As for ""Hetty Wainthropp Investigates...""  The Series is a delight.  Laid-back intensity (can you imagine ""laid-back intensity?"") without all the screaming and hollering usually connected to criminal/detective activity on screen.  Every detail seems to be perfect.

The conclusions come so quickly and abruptly they can almost be parodied. Where's the conclusion? How EXACTLY did Hetty solve this?

There are many interesting settings, but the writing just isn't up to the quality one might find in Midsommer Mysteries, The Last Detective (though the dialogue is near impossible to understand at times in that one for an American), A Touch of Frost, Rosemary and Thyme or my favorite Foyle's War, which is head and shoulders above the rest.",1256428800,9,825,4.715277777777778
2857649,4,B000R349GQ,"I adored Ms Routledge in her role as Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances. She was so good, I assumed she had always been a comedic actress. Therefore, imagine my surprise when I came across a pilot of a mystery series with Ms Routledge in the lead role. Clearly, I had to investigate further. The pilot, ""Missing Persons"" was filmed in 1990 (just before ""Keeping Up Appearances"", which ran 1990 thru 1995). To put it bluntly, it was not very good, and unsurprisingly, was not picked up for development. Thankfully, some clever soul eventually recognized the material's potential and after ""Keeping Up Appearances"" ended, the new series went full steam. ""Hetty Wainthropp Investigates"" is based on a novel ""Missing Persons"" by David Cook. The author used a real life character, his own mother, as an inspiration for Hetty. Hetty is a working class housewife who late in life discovers an affinity for intuitive thinking and an appreciation for earning her own wage. Supported by her retired husband and a wayward youth they accept into their humble home (pre-Lord-of-the-Rings Dominic Monaghan), Hetty embarks on a series of small and big adventures. Her clients come from a word of mouth, yellow pages, or, when there is extra money left, from small print ads in the local paper. Hetty is smart, resourceful and unrelenting. Ands keeps the viewer glued to the TV.

I strongly advise that you view the pilot for historical purposes only. Then, promptly forget it and move on to the series. Enjoy!",1256428800,12,1501,4.9563492063492065

Hetty, the main character, refuses to take retirement and sit around the house, so she starts her own detective agency. She teams up with a teenage/college age man she meets in the grocery store and together they unravel the many mysteries that are brought to their agency.

2857660,5,B000R349GQ,"""Hetty Wainthropp Investigates: The Complete Collection, ""(1997) a lighthearted comic/mystery television series produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation, comes to us starring Patricia Routledge, beloved by many for her iconic turn as Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced as ""bouquet,""you trailer trash) in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keeping-Up-Appearances-The-Full-Bouquet/dp/B0019MFY36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keeping Up Appearances: The Full Bouquet</a>. That's the ever-popular 1990's comedy television series, also made by the BBC.  The box set is a wonderful cornucopia, bringing us all 27 episodes of the show, plus the pilot, ""Missing Persons,"" written and produced by David Cook, based on his novel of the same name: the series is based on these characters he created.  (The set also includes some episodes not previous seen in the Public Broadcasting System telecast).  In addition, the series co-stars Dominic Monaghan as Hetty's young sidekick Geoffrey Shawcross; this was his breakout role, before he became a star in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-Theatrical-Editions/dp/B000X9FLKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions)</a>.

Routledge, a long-term star of stage and screen, who was voted the United Kingdom's all-time favorite television actress in a BBC poll, stars as the 60-something Hetty, who christens herself as a private investigator - without prior police experience, or indeed, any sleuthing experience.  Yet she's able to solve mysteries, armed with the local Lancashire no-nonsense attitude, a smart mind, common sense, and plenty of moxie.  She's assisted by Derek Benfield (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rumpole-of-the-Bailey-The-Complete-Series-Megaset/dp/B000CRR360/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rumpole of the Bailey: The Complete Series Megaset</a>,) as her supportive husband Robert, by John Graham-Davies as DCI Adams, and, eventually, by Suzanne Maddock as Geoff's girlfriend Janet Frazer.  She's frustratingly impeded by Robert's foolish brother Frank (Frank Mills).  The series is set, and filmed, in Lancashire in the North of England: you might say it does for Lancs. what Angela Lansbury's Jessica Fletcher did for New England's Cabot Cove.  And, of course, what the American television hit did for women mystery fans of a certain age. And, praises be, and here comes the DePue subtitles report; as the series is chock full of delightful local accents and idiom, there are -unadvertised--closed captions, thank you, Acorn.

The production was filmed on site in the area of Bolton, Greater Manchester.  There are trips to Darwen, Blackburn, and the Ribble Valley, and even, in ""Blood Relations,"" the last episode, one to Yorkshire: Hetty tartly informs her husband that no passport is required.  Scenes at the Women's Refuge in the ""Woman of the Year"" episode were made at Chaigley Manor, near Chipping.  And the hotel scenes in ""Daughter of the Regiment,"" in which Hetty and Geoff hilariously pretend to be Australian, were filmed in the ""The Swan and Royal,"" on Castle Street in Chitheroe; a bit further up the hill from where Woolworth once was. (You can see the town landmark, the library clock, at several points during the episode).

Routledge, of course, is a bit older and heavier than she was in ""Appearances"" days; and this is a more serious part.  But the humor is still there; you can catch many facial expressions that resemble Hyacinth's, particularly when Hetty takes the phone: pay attention in ""Child's Play."" In ""Safe as Houses,"" Hetty gives us an old vaudeville song and soft-shoe to ""Burlington Bertie.""  In the ""Lost Chords"" episode, we get to explore ""Northern Food for Northern Folk,"" as one character says.  We hear Hetty sing ""Cuckoo"" in ""Daughter of the Regiment.""  In ""A Minor Operation,"" Hetty admits that she was once on the stage, kicking up her heels in black fishnet stockings.  And she uncorks a nice soprano to give us a hymn in ""Blood Relations.""

Hetty is noticeably younger, and gray-haired, in ""Missing Persons,"" the pilot, made six years before the series.  It's also noticeable that all the major male parts have been recast from the pilot to the series: it was filmed six years later, after all.  And Hetty's hanging out with a flavorful bunch of people, much lower on the social scale than is usual for the later series: think Onslow and Daisy, rather than Violet and Bruce.  ""Missing Persons"" is quite interesting on its own terms, giving us a close, insightful look at people not ordinarily seen on TV: they're much older than usual: and we get, in addition, a moving look at heartfelt life-long friendship and love among them.

Listen, this series is definitely the next-best thing to more ""Keeping Up Appearances."" Plus, you get so much for your money: your life can be a Hetty/Hyacinth festival for weeks.",1221782400,38,5032,5.759784075573549

8198606,5,B000R349GQ,"Oh Patricia Routledge turns in a marvelous acting performance (Keeping Up Appearances fame).  Her sidekick, Geofrey and to husband, Robert, all have a great chemistry.  What great little mysteries as Hetty has opened her own dectective agency and they go about solving them.  Nonviolent and based on a book when Ms. Routledge was tapped for the part.  Each episode is about 1 hour long and they close out each case,  Highly recommend.  British English with subtitles.",1514419200,,467,5.078947368421052

It isn't grisley, horrific, or too much violence to watch right before you try to go to sleep either.  The acting is wonderful, and the story lines are interesting and even humorous.  Love it!",1508976000,,282,4.264150943396227
