7305142,2,B0106O4QYU,"Adam Scott! Taylor Schilling! This must be hilarious, correct?

Apparently some viewers found humor in supposedly cringeworthy moments, but it seems that you'd have to be living a cloistered or dull life to either cringe or laugh during The Overnight. What you DO get is two couples, one bland, the other not. The latter couple suffers from a douchey guy -- not the belligerent, low IQ type of douchey, but a hip, pretentious, protracted douchiness that is equally tiresome and arguably more tedious to watch. Don't get me wrong, douchey guys are sometimes the cornerstone of a magnificent comedy, but here's an actor you'd like to meet after the film simply for the opportunity to pop him in the nose or publicly shame him for taking the role.

If breast pumps are no end of mirth for you, or if you can't stop giggling about penis size blather (and really, what 7th grader can't?), then knock yourself out with The Overnight. For the rest of us, we can look forward to watching actors enjoy themselves by drinking bottles of champagne and red wine, toking a family-sized bong, skinny dipping in the pool of a moderately upscale L.A. home, and more (I won't ""spoil"" the rest, assuming you can make it to the final half-hour). The last minute of the story was a total copout, a surrender to those viewers who have meltdowns if a film doesn't conform to the standard issue 20th century [Hollywood] ending... if screenwriter / director Patrick Brice wasn't forced at gunpoint to conclude the flick as he did, then he has no excuse for his crime and should be imprisoned.

So why the 2-star rather than a 1-star rating? Primarily for two reasons: [1] the second half is better than the first (the buildup isn't anticlimactic), and most importantly [2] the acting is to be commended, especially Taylor Schilling and the seductive French actress Judith Godrche (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ridicule/dp/B0000DZ3C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ridicule</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Auberge-Espagnole/dp/B0000C9JFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Auberge Espagnole</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bimboland/dp/B003757R88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bimboland</a>).

7305143,4,B0106O4QYU,"The Duplass Brothers seem to have landed on a theme. Much like their adequately zany if a bit featherlight The One I Love, The Overnight concerns an everyday couple with some everyday problems entering a house on a random evening, and having their worldviews turned absolutely askew.  Whereas T.O.I.L scurried off into the sort of surreal terrain Charlie Kaufman has made a career exploring, however, The Overnight wisely plays it straight...for the most part. What we confront here through the wide eyed gaze of plucky new school indie it-boy Adam Scott and ladies prison heroine extraordinare Taylor Schiling is everything you'd never want to confront at a dinner party with strangers...at least until after you'd downed a few bottles of wine and rips on an over-sized bong. Both wine and pot are in abundance here, and some pretty uncomfortable things start to happen at about the twenty minute mark (which is about 1/3 of the way in--this movie is a breezy 80 minutes).  I'll say no more by way of potential spoilers as this flick is well worth the journey if you can stand a cringe or two. In fact, it's a tense and winning little affair with a constant sense of dread, believe it or not, given the free-wheeling LA mansion setting and the oddity of the other couple (old world indie darling Jason Schwartzman has never been better, and while a bit flat at times Judith Godreche manages to keep up with him) to balance out the sweetness and love conquers all spirit. If you're in the mood to squirmy giggle, you could do far worse than to expand with this one.",1436918400,8,1565,4.708029197080292
7305144,4,B0106O4QYU,"""The Overnight"" (2015 release; 80 min.) brings the story of two couples. As the movie opens, we get to know Alex and Emily (played by Adam Scott and Taylor Schilling, respectively). Their young son busts into the bedroom as Alex and Emily are making love. The family is moving from Seattle to Los Angeles, and it's not long thereafter that Alex and Emily, in the park with their son, makes the acquaintance of Kurt (played by Jason Schwartzman) and his young son. They all hit it off and Kurt invites them on an impromptu pizza dinner at his house. Alex and Emily are delighted to make new friends so quickly, and eagerly accept. They arrive later that day at Kurt's mansion and are introduced to Kurt's wife Charlotte (played by Judith Godr&egrave;che). Everyone is enjoying themselves, and rather than ending the night early, the couples decide to put their sons to bed. At this point we are not quite 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: ""The Overnight"" is written and directed by Patrick Price, who previously brought us the horror indie ""Creep"", but importantly, it is executive produced by Jay and Mark Duplass as well as Adam Scott (who stars as well). The movie is a sex comedy that probes delightfully into the question of when things become uncomfortable, and as a result perhaps unexpectedly revealing, for a couple. And when I write 'revealing', you can take that also literally. Beware: there is quite a bit of nudity in the movie (including male frontal nudity--although I gather from the movie's end credits that it's all prosthetic), so if that bothers you, you are forewarned. As things become more weird, Alex and Emily wonder aloud ""is this a free-wheeling California vibe, or a swingers vibe?"", and we, the audience, wonder along with them. There are some great twists along the way that I obviously will not reveal here. All four lead performers are excellent and you will fully buy in to their respective predicaments. Kudos also for the excellent music placement in the movie. As the couples are enjoying the evening, the Sparks' excellent ""Tryout For the Human Race"" comes blasting on. I literally hadn't heard that song in forever, and brings back great memories. Other music includes Of Montreal and Julian Wass, just to name those. The movie appears to have been (partly) crowdfunded, from the looks of the endless list of thank-yous at the end of the movie credits.

This movie made quite s splash at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and I had been looking forward to seeing it. The movie finally opened on a couple of screens here in Cincinnati this weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening, as in: I was literally the only person in the theater. I can't say that I was all that surprised, given that this is a talkie (no ""action"") about a subject matter that may not feel comfortable for some. I happened to quite enjoy this exercise in finding where a couple's comfort zone ends and where discomfort could spill out into even more. If you are in the mood for a racy comedy that is LIGHT YEARS away from your average Hollywood fare, you should give this one a try, be it in the theater, or eventually on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",1435881600,13,3391,4.697478991596639

Discovering everyone's motivations and navigating their desires is both funny and awkward. Worth checking out if you ever wondered what group sex would be like- this is not pornographic at all- it is more about the idea of group sex and why it is difficult to make happen.

7305178,5,B0106O4QYU,I found this film to be an insightful and intimate look into relationships and human nature.  Everyone struggles with insecurity and this film delves deep into self concept issues and courageously explored men's insecurities about penis size. It was done in a caring and empowering way for men who aren't well endowed. The film also addresses our inner fears about not being desired by our partners.  I appreciated its depiction of swingers as people wanting to meet an important emotional need.  Overall this movie brought into the light some sensitive issues in a heartfelt way.,1453075200,4,580,5.08421052631579

A couple who's marriage has gotten a little boring and their sex life has as well meets another couple in a park who are a little odd and outspoken and after a dinner invite is extended the movie goes into full throttle.

Adam Scott does a great Mark Duplass impression and Jason Schwartzman has some of the best lines of the film. Judith Godreche was great but wasn't cast well as the wife of Schwartzman's character. Taylor Schilling was serviceable. There are some surprising plot twists and some laugh out loud moments but ultimately an slightly above average indie film.

Whoever was behind this movie just didn't really seem like they had anything to say. Events occur on screen but there is no message or emotion behind them. And as for humor, there just isn't any (though I assume *someone* thought the male actor's prosthetic devices were screamingly funny, though I'm not sure why).

Really, it just exists as one big shaggy dog story, leading the viewer to neither comedy nor titillation. No one in this slight movie comes off worse for the wear though: it's not a terrible movie, just one that has no reason to exist.",1444694400,,650,4.453781512605042

Although unexpected turns of plot can be amusing, humor also needs to involve timing, delivery, and context. This was a self-entertaining screenplay that failed to be a provocative parody or a satirical criticism of our culture. The characters seemed to belong in This is Forty (another tedious, laugh-less piece), but without even that film's attempt to make them original or comedically-compelling. I kept waiting for the arrival of the central conflict to arise, and it never came.

Adam Scott and Taylor Schilling are both terrific as a couple that prove themselves to be both easily relatable and incredibly flawed. Jason Schwartzman turns in one of the best and most eccentric performances of his career.

7305342,3,B0106O4QYU,"Quirky movie that looked like it was going to spiral completely out of control but instead bordered on the fringe.  There were some funny moments as well as some awkward ones too.  The acting was really good and many of the situations built up just the right amount of tension.  BUT...it always seemed like someone (writer/director etc) insisted on pulling on the reins, to prevent the movie from plummeting into a downward spiral.  So all that said, if you enjoy movies that toss some awkward moments in that people clumsily always manage to extract themselves from while being able to maintain their dignity, then this is a good movie for you.  If you are more interested in watching a movie where people completely lose themselves and morph into phantasms they never conceived possible, then keep looking.  I was originally going to give this movie a 4 star rating for the acting but I am downgrading this to 3 stars for kind of falling flat on its face near the end of the movie.",1441929600,4,983,4.6531791907514455
