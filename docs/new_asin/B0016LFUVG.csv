3158867,3,B0016LFUVG,"I remember this great movie from my childhood. Seeing it in Black & White on TV around 1964 or so. I loved it.

Seeing it on DVD is a bit of a disappointment because the 3 Strip Technicolor has not been restored. Like all of these old Technicolor treasures they have various problems all having to do with the registration problems of the 3 strips. At various times Tony Curtis has green lines under his eyes, back gounds become blurry.

It looks like films like Gone with the Wind and Wizard of OZ did before they had there restorations. Somehow they need to figure out a way make it affordable to bring a classic like this back to the kind of spendor that it deserves.",1213920000,5,670,4.352
3158868,5,B0016LFUVG,"Finally this cinematic treasure comes to DVD.  While sometimes not historically accurate, it does portray a young Ehrich Weiss and his passion for the art of escapism & illusion and his love for his wife Bess.  Real life husband and wife couple, Tony Curtis & Janet Leigh are more than convincing as ""The Great Houdini"" and his stage assistant.

This delightful film will bring enjoyment to legions of fans of old like myself as well as a cursory enlightenment of Harry Houdini for newer generations.

Filmed in 1953, ""Houdini"" is presented in Technicolor with an Aspect Ratio of 1.37:1.  A very family friendly movie, recommended without reservation.

3158869,5,B0016LFUVG,"This film is a very enjoyable if not completely accurate rendition of Harry Houdini's life. Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, young and in love in real life, do a great job of playing Harry and Bess Houdini. An amateur magician himself, Curtis gives a great performance in the first really good role of his career. There will be many to come. What's accurate about this film? Most of the escapes shown in the film such as when Houdini allowed himself to be hung upside down outside of a tall building while confined in a strait jacket, his offering and succeeding to escape from any pair of handcuffs that his audiences could produce, and his decision to go through with being locked in a box submerged in water while he himself is bound in chains.

What's inaccurate in the film? It's more a matter of what is omitted. The film does mention Houdini's running battle with spiritualists. What it doesn't mention is Houdini's tiff with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle over the whole issue. The depth and length of this disagreement is considerable, though, and it's understandable that in a film not of documentary length that it had to be left out.

Sadly enough, the film has only a trailer as an extra feature.
A commentary track, an actual documentary, or even - if it was possible - to include the excellent 1976 made-for-TV film ""The Great Houdini"" with Paul Michael Glaser in the title role would have made for a better package. That 70's version of Houdini's life gives more details about what made the man tick, even if there is something about its atmosphere that transports one back to the days of disco. At any rate, when it comes to classics from Paramount, I'll take them any way I can get them.",1208649600,16,1693,4.602649006622516

3158881,3,B0016LFUVG,"Houdini, 1953 film

It begins at a carnival show. A young lady objects to the treatment of a Wild Man. The Great Houdini shows a magic trick. Whats her name? There is another death-defying trick! Stop it! Then a Professor offers to rejuvenate an old man. It works! [Show business is based on illusions.] How could you know? Bess switches escorts. They quickly marry. Harry shows her a new trick; she expected something else! Harry shows a rough crowd a new trick. How about a factory job? Its steady work. They eat out then go to watch a show. Men are placed in straight jackets and offered a prize if they can get out. The crowd watches and laughs. Harry does it! The magician tells about another trick. The prize is a round trip ticket to Europe. Its cashed in.

Harry tries a trick at work - hes fired! They sail to London. Bess gets into a cloth bag that is locked into a trunk. The Metamorphosis is a big hit! [How did he do it?] Can he escape from a London jail cell? 2 is the prize. English jails don't have a lock in the door. We see Harrys skills. Bess gives a build-up to the audience. The show goes on and pleases the audience. The Houdinis tour the Continent. They perform in Germany. Harry is brought into Court to answer charges. Harry gets into a safe that is locked! Arent you worried? Very good. Safes are built to keep people out, not keep them in. Otto tells Harry about Von Schweiger - he just died. They return to America. Houdini escapes from a straight jacket while suspended over seventy feet above the pavement! Harry prepares for a dip in cold water, locked inside an iron chest. The chain broke! [Part of the act?]

Can Harry find the hole in the ice? Grappling hooks raise the iron chest, but it is empty! There is air pockets beneath the ice, the current pushed him away. Later a long distance telephone call brings sad news. Harry goes into seclusion. A reporter from the NY Observer gets an interview about his activities. Can he contact the spirit world during a sance? Is this a trick or a fraud? [Spiritualism was a fad then.] Houdini prepares for a new trick. The audience is never satisfied, they want another trick. [What does this say about the audience?] But Harry isn't well - stomach pains. Harry is lowered into a huge glass jar filled with water. Get a doctor! Something went wrong! Harry tells Bess what hell do next.

This is pleasant Hollywood History of Harry Houdini, a famous magician or illusionist in the early twentieth century. Note the absence of references to what was going on during this era. There may not be any book about Houdini, except as referenced in other books. This is about average, and seems like a lower budget production. What other magicians were used as subjects for a movie? It educates about show business and its illusions. Appendicitis can be prevented by roughage in the diet (coleslaw, whole-wheat bread).

3158885,4,B0016LFUVG,"I think we should clarify right up front: as a movie that stands on its own, telling a story about a magician, this was absolutely first rate, an entertaining excursion that merits 5 stars.  Now...as a history of 'Houdini' himself, it's less accurate, showing some of the famous events in his career while neither showing us the 'trick'(as opposed to magic) nor the exact actual events.  For that, it merits a still positive 3 stars, thus our composite 4 star rating.
The film stars Tony Curtis as the dashing and ambitious magician.  We see the famous water tank trick, an escape from Scotland Yard's finest jail, the inverted strait jacket escape, and finally the punch from a 'fan'(?) which led to his(Houdini's) final demise.  Most of it's here though we do not learn any of the tricks(such as hidden keys or slip locks) he (may have) used.
In conclusion, this is a fine entertaining film that covers 'a Houdini' if not THE Houdini.  We're always entertained and surprised, though nowadays with magic being somewhat revealed in expose' reality shows, we're perhaps not as naive as the Houdini fans of the last century...",1424390400,2,1124,4.833333333333333

3158899,1,B0016LFUVG,"While many people cite this film as the springboard for their interest in Houdini and magic, I would have to agree, though not in the way you'd expect. I first watched this film after having read a few kid's biographies of Houdini, and while I could pick out the most glaring inaccuracies, I was swept up in the excitement of seeing his life unfold on screen and was able to overlook them. I was lead to read more in-depth books about him, and would now consider myself a self-proclaimed Houdini-phile. I wanted to view this film again to compare fact to fiction, and I liked it even less the second time. It is simply astounding how the filmmakers managed to get everything, and I mean everything, wrong. It might be nice to look at, but it certainly isn't getting any points for historical accuracy.

While the book by Harold Kellock (the first biography of Houdini ever written), cited in the opening credits as the source material, contained a fair amount of Houdini-spun legend as well as fact, virtually every incident in the film was made up by the screenwriters. As a screenwriter myself, I understand the necessity of condensing and simplifying in order to make a film that doesn't run six hours and that manages to entertain, but the massive discrepancies only make the film confusing and grating on the nerves. It's as if they found it too difficult to tackle what really happened, so they decided instead on a nice, tidy, yet inaccurate fairy tale. It might be more appropriate to say ""inspired by"" the life of than actually ""based on"". The tone is uneven, being too light-hearted in some places and too melodramatic in others, and is overall more suitable as Saturday-matinee kiddie fare than a serious biopic.

The only incident from the book included in the film was the frozen bridge escape (which was in fact a myth created by Houdini), but even then they had to change it: they made it a box escape that just happened to occur on same day that Houdini's mother died (in actuality, his (non-frozen) Detroit jump occurred in 1906, while she died in 1913). I'll never understand the fascination with avoiding telling the real story about his life, as what really happened was easily more intriguing and exciting. With so much falsified information, it makes watching this film painful to anyone with even a remote idea of what his real life was like.

The storyline doesn't so much follow his life as an abridged, watered-down version of it, simplified to the point of being childish, and leaving out key events in favor of invented ones. There is a bizarre fatalistic streak present, evidenced by the ridiculously unsubtle line, ""It'll make you famous, but it will kill you,"" in reference to Houdini's strait-jacket escape, or the over-referenced date of October 31st, on which, in the film, Houdini claims something bad always happens to him (spoiler alert). This presents Houdini's life not as an inspirational one full of triumphs, but as a dark tale of a foolish man who goes against every word of caution spoken to him, culminating in a very shocking, very untrue, I-told-you-so kind of finale.

Tony Curtis, due mostly in part to the bad script full of inane dialogue, gives a very bland, wimpish performance as Houdini. His motivations for wanting a career in magic or to keep doing bigger and better stunts is never properly explained, and he fails to show the incredible drive and determination that the real Houdini possessed. While physically taller than Houdini was in real life, Curtis, while handsome, is clearly a film actor, and lacks the magnetism and charisma so characteristic of stage performers and certainly Houdini himself.

Janet Leigh does what she can with the material as Harry's wife and assistant Bess, but unlike the real Bess, she is something of a wet blanket on Harry's career, forever begging him to give up magic in favor of a normal life, and effectively becoming the main antagonist of the story. While the chemistry is there between her and her real-life husband, we never get the idea that she really loves him, as she never seems to be able to support him fully in his endeavors. I find this appalling, as in real life she was a performer herself, and while there may have been some professional jealousy and exasperation with his taste for the extreme, there was no question she was his main advocate and most steadfast supporter. While Leigh is unquestionably good-looking, in reality Bess was not a blonde but a brunette, and would never have worn anything close to the skimpy corset-and-fishnet-stockings costumes as shown in the film; in those days, only burlesque queens would have been caught dead in a get-up like that.

Honestly, the only performance that was really genuine and that I truly enjoyed was Angela Clarke's as Harry's mother, Mrs. Weiss, but she is only in a few scenes, with precious little dialogue.

My main point of contention with ""Houdini"" is the scandalous way Houdini's death is presented. Thanks to this film, the myth that he died while performing his water torture cell (called quite erroneously the pagoda torture cell here) has proliferated among those who have never picked up a book about him. To get the record straight, Houdini never failed an escape, and it was not while performing that he died from ruptured appendix. The fact that the filmmakers stooped so low is beyond unforgivable.

While this film might be classed as entertainment for those who don't know Houdini's life story, if you're more well-versed on it and are looking for a film that accurately depicts Houdini's life, than this isn't the picture for you.",1406937600,3,5618,4.838709677419355

This condition was mentioned near the end of the movie, but the filmakers led you to believe he actually died in the Chineese Water Torture tank. The movie did bring out his fascination with the after life, mainly communication with the dead, which he was hoping to acheive after his mother died.

3158931,4,B0016LFUVG,"The life of Harry Houdini (1874-1926), at the time the most famous magician in the world, is given the Hollywood treatment in Houdini (1953), with Tony Curtis starring as the Great Houdini, the legendary illusionist and escape artist.  Janet Leigh, married to Curtis at the time, appears as Houdini's wife Bess.  Leigh looks stunning, and gives a very solid performance, as Houdini's partner for life, both on and off the stage.

The film hits some of the high points of the magician's colorful life, embellishing the truth for dramatic purposes.  Curtis certainly shines in his portrayal, bringing a lot of flair and charm to the role.  The early part of the movie recounts Houdini's humble beginnings in vaudeville, his romance and marriage to Bess, and the period where the couple lived with Houdini's mother (Angela Clarke), who remained a major influence in his life.

With Bess as his assistant, Harry focused on becoming an escape artist and illusionist, working to master the opening of locks, handcuffs, and eventually safes.  Winning a prize provides the opportunity for the Houdini's to journey to England, where Harry gains more notoriety after escaping from a prison cell.  Performing in Europe, Houdini's career takes off.  While mostly based on some elements of truth, the film features a mysterious German magician named Johann Von Schweger, who Houdini unsuccessfully attempts to contact many times.  After Von Schweger passes away, in another strange development, Von Schweger's assistant Otto (Torin Thatcher), becomes Houdini's loyal aide.

Returning to America, the magician works to establish himself as a performer.  Tragedy strikes, when Houdini's mother passes away while he is in Detroit, attempting to escape from a crate dropped through a hole in the ice on a frozen river.  The stunt nearly claims Houdini's life, but he claims that his mother's voice mysteriously guided him to safety.  This event causes Houdini to stop performing, and explore the possibility of communicating with the spirits of the dead, and debunking fake mediums.  Houdini eventually returns to performing, attempting more spectacular tricks.  The dangerous pagoda water torture cell escape is eliminated from the act, until the audience demands that Houdini perform it.

Houdini the movie, is quite entertaining, and while not entirely accurate, gets a lot of things right while building up the mystique surrounding the famous magician.  It's understandable that Houdini's death from appendicitis was dramatized, and it doesn't matter that Bess was actually a brunette, but the whole Von Schweger storyline is a curious element, as the filmmakers seem bent of playing up the supernatural angle.  Rather than being the cause of his death, the water torture cell escape was a trick that Houdini successfully performed for many years.  The makeup effects are nicely done, as the Houdini's both age gracefully through the course of the film.  With some impressive set designs, and winning performances from Curtis and Leigh, Houdini rates a solid 4.5 stars.  The film would earn a 5 star rating, if not for the various factual inconsistencies.",1315699200,5,3142,5.279678068410463

3158942,5,B0016LFUVG,"When I was a kid, HOUDINI (1953) with Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh was always broadcast in October, usually as a Saturday afternoon movie.

There are two mentions in it of Halloween.
The first happens when Harry and Bess Houdini visit a magician's convention on Halloween night. Unhappy Harry failed at magic and took a job in a lock factory at his wife's urging, but when given the opportunity to go on stage as one of five challengers who must try to escape from strait jackets, Harry jumps at it. He wins the contest and his prize is a single round-trip ticket to Europe. Eventually the couple trades it for two one-way ducats. Harry and Bess find fame in Britain and on the Continent and then repeat their success in America.

The second Halloween reference is to a near-tragic stunt held on Halloween afternoon: an escape from a locked trunk submerged in the iced-over Detroit River. When he emerges from the trunk, Harry's swept downstream by the current, can't find the large hole cut in the ice and nearly drowns and/or freezes to death.

Despite that and a sad ending, this is generally an upbeat film. Colorful re-creations of late 19th Century sideshows are fun and so are the many magic tricks and escapes. Also, Leigh and Curtis make a most pulchritudinous couple and are clearly in love (for real!).

I recommend HOUDINI to all as a pleasant October diversion.

BTW-- does the Detroit River REALLY ice over before October 31st and is the outside temperature ZERO degrees in the DAYTIME?  (Don't answer that!)",1255392000,5,1521,4.742424242424242

This delightful film will bring enjoyment to legions of fans of old like myself as well as a cursory enlightenment of Harry Houdini for newer generations.

3393366,5,B0016LFUVG,"This film is a very enjoyable if not completely accurate rendition of Harry Houdini's life. Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, young and in love in real life, do a great job of playing Harry and Bess Houdini. An amateur magician himself, Curtis gives a great performance in the first really good role of his career. There will be many to come. What's accurate about this film? Most of the escapes shown in the film such as when Houdini allowed himself to be hung upside down outside of a tall building while confined in a strait jacket, his offering and succeeding to escape from any pair of handcuffs that his audiences could produce, and his decision to go through with being locked in a box submerged in water while he himself is bound in chains.

What's inaccurate in the film? It's more a matter of what is omitted. The film does mention Houdini's running battle with spiritualists. What it doesn't mention is Houdini's tiff with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle over the whole issue. The depth and length of this disagreement is considerable, though, and it's understandable that in a film not of documentary length that it had to be left out.

Sadly enough, the film has only a trailer as an extra feature.
A commentary track, an actual documentary, or even - if it was possible - to include the excellent 1976 made-for-TV film ""The Great Houdini"" with Paul Michael Glaser in the title role would have made for a better package. That 70's version of Houdini's life gives more details about what made the man tick, even if there is something about its atmosphere that transports one back to the days of disco.

It begins at a carnival show. A young lady objects to the treatment of a Wild Man. The Great Houdini shows a magic trick. Whats her name? There is another death-defying trick! Stop it! Then a Professor offers to rejuvenate an old man. It works! [Show business is based on illusions.] How could you know? Bess switches escorts. They quickly marry. Harry shows her a new trick; she expected something else! Harry shows a rough crowd a new trick. How about a factory job? Its steady work. They eat out then go to watch a show. Men are placed in straight jackets and offered a prize if they can get out. The crowd watches and laughs. Harry does it! The magician tells about another trick. The prize is a round trip ticket to Europe. Its cashed in.

Harry tries a trick at work - hes fired! They sail to London. Bess gets into a cloth bag that is locked into a trunk. The Metamorphosis is a big hit! [How did he do it?] Can he escape from a London jail cell? 2 is the prize. English jails don't have a lock in the door. We see Harrys skills. Bess gives a build-up to the audience. The show goes on and pleases the audience. The Houdinis tour the Continent. They perform in Germany. Harry is brought into Court to answer charges. Harry gets into a safe that is locked! Arent you worried? Very good. Safes are built to keep people out, not keep them in. Otto tells Harry about Von Schweiger - he just died. They return to America. Houdini escapes from a straight jacket while suspended over seventy feet above the pavement! Harry prepares for a dip in cold water, locked inside an iron chest. The chain broke! [Part of the act?]

Can Harry find the hole in the ice? Grappling hooks raise the iron chest, but it is empty! There is air pockets beneath the ice, the current pushed him away. Later a long distance telephone call brings sad news. Harry goes into seclusion. A reporter from the NY Observer gets an interview about his activities. Can he contact the spirit world during a sance? Is this a trick or a fraud? [Spiritualism was a fad then.] Houdini prepares for a new trick. The audience is never satisfied, they want another trick. [What does this say about the audience?] But Harry isn't well - stomach pains. Harry is lowered into a huge glass jar filled with water. Get a doctor! Something went wrong! Harry tells Bess what hell do next.

This is pleasant Hollywood History of Harry Houdini, a famous magician or illusionist in the early twentieth century. Note the absence of references to what was going on during this era.

3393382,4,B0016LFUVG,"I think we should clarify right up front: as a movie that stands on its own, telling a story about a magician, this was absolutely first rate, an entertaining excursion that merits 5 stars.  Now...as a history of 'Houdini' himself, it's less accurate, showing some of the famous events in his career while neither showing us the 'trick'(as opposed to magic) nor the exact actual events.  For that, it merits a still positive 3 stars, thus our composite 4 star rating.
The film stars Tony Curtis as the dashing and ambitious magician.  We see the famous water tank trick, an escape from Scotland Yard's finest jail, the inverted strait jacket escape, and finally the punch from a 'fan'(?) which led to his(Houdini's) final demise.  Most of it's here though we do not learn any of the tricks(such as hidden keys or slip locks) he (may have) used.
In conclusion, this is a fine entertaining film that covers 'a Houdini' if not THE Houdini.

3393396,1,B0016LFUVG,"While many people cite this film as the springboard for their interest in Houdini and magic, I would have to agree, though not in the way you'd expect. I first watched this film after having read a few kid's biographies of Houdini, and while I could pick out the most glaring inaccuracies, I was swept up in the excitement of seeing his life unfold on screen and was able to overlook them. I was lead to read more in-depth books about him, and would now consider myself a self-proclaimed Houdini-phile. I wanted to view this film again to compare fact to fiction, and I liked it even less the second time. It is simply astounding how the filmmakers managed to get everything, and I mean everything, wrong. It might be nice to look at, but it certainly isn't getting any points for historical accuracy.

While the book by Harold Kellock (the first biography of Houdini ever written), cited in the opening credits as the source material, contained a fair amount of Houdini-spun legend as well as fact, virtually every incident in the film was made up by the screenwriters. As a screenwriter myself, I understand the necessity of condensing and simplifying in order to make a film that doesn't run six hours and that manages to entertain, but the massive discrepancies only make the film confusing and grating on the nerves. It's as if they found it too difficult to tackle what really happened, so they decided instead on a nice, tidy, yet inaccurate fairy tale. It might be more appropriate to say ""inspired by"" the life of than actually ""based on"". The tone is uneven, being too light-hearted in some places and too melodramatic in others, and is overall more suitable as Saturday-matinee kiddie fare than a serious biopic.

The only incident from the book included in the film was the frozen bridge escape (which was in fact a myth created by Houdini), but even then they had to change it: they made it a box escape that just happened to occur on same day that Houdini's mother died (in actuality, his (non-frozen) Detroit jump occurred in 1906, while she died in 1913). I'll never understand the fascination with avoiding telling the real story about his life, as what really happened was easily more intriguing and exciting. With so much falsified information, it makes watching this film painful to anyone with even a remote idea of what his real life was like.

The storyline doesn't so much follow his life as an abridged, watered-down version of it, simplified to the point of being childish, and leaving out key events in favor of invented ones. There is a bizarre fatalistic streak present, evidenced by the ridiculously unsubtle line, ""It'll make you famous, but it will kill you,"" in reference to Houdini's strait-jacket escape, or the over-referenced date of October 31st, on which, in the film, Houdini claims something bad always happens to him (spoiler alert). This presents Houdini's life not as an inspirational one full of triumphs, but as a dark tale of a foolish man who goes against every word of caution spoken to him, culminating in a very shocking, very untrue, I-told-you-so kind of finale.

Tony Curtis, due mostly in part to the bad script full of inane dialogue, gives a very bland, wimpish performance as Houdini. His motivations for wanting a career in magic or to keep doing bigger and better stunts is never properly explained, and he fails to show the incredible drive and determination that the real Houdini possessed. While physically taller than Houdini was in real life, Curtis, while handsome, is clearly a film actor, and lacks the magnetism and charisma so characteristic of stage performers and certainly Houdini himself.

Janet Leigh does what she can with the material as Harry's wife and assistant Bess, but unlike the real Bess, she is something of a wet blanket on Harry's career, forever begging him to give up magic in favor of a normal life, and effectively becoming the main antagonist of the story. While the chemistry is there between her and her real-life husband, we never get the idea that she really loves him, as she never seems to be able to support him fully in his endeavors. I find this appalling, as in real life she was a performer herself, and while there may have been some professional jealousy and exasperation with his taste for the extreme, there was no question she was his main advocate and most steadfast supporter. While Leigh is unquestionably good-looking, in reality Bess was not a blonde but a brunette, and would never have worn anything close to the skimpy corset-and-fishnet-stockings costumes as shown in the film; in those days, only burlesque queens would have been caught dead in a get-up like that.

Honestly, the only performance that was really genuine and that I truly enjoyed was Angela Clarke's as Harry's mother, Mrs. Weiss, but she is only in a few scenes, with precious little dialogue.

My main point of contention with ""Houdini"" is the scandalous way Houdini's death is presented. Thanks to this film, the myth that he died while performing his water torture cell (called quite erroneously the pagoda torture cell here) has proliferated among those who have never picked up a book about him. To get the record straight, Houdini never failed an escape, and it was not while performing that he died from ruptured appendix. The fact that the filmmakers stooped so low is beyond unforgivable.

While this film might be classed as entertainment for those who don't know Houdini's life story, if you're more well-versed on it and are looking for a film that accurately depicts Houdini's life, than this isn't the picture for you.",1406937600,3,5618,4.838709677419355

This condition was mentioned near the end of the movie, but the filmakers led you to believe he actually died in the Chineese Water Torture tank.

3393428,4,B0016LFUVG,"The life of Harry Houdini (1874-1926), at the time the most famous magician in the world, is given the Hollywood treatment in Houdini (1953), with Tony Curtis starring as the Great Houdini, the legendary illusionist and escape artist.  Janet Leigh, married to Curtis at the time, appears as Houdini's wife Bess.  Leigh looks stunning, and gives a very solid performance, as Houdini's partner for life, both on and off the stage.

The film hits some of the high points of the magician's colorful life, embellishing the truth for dramatic purposes.  Curtis certainly shines in his portrayal, bringing a lot of flair and charm to the role.  The early part of the movie recounts Houdini's humble beginnings in vaudeville, his romance and marriage to Bess, and the period where the couple lived with Houdini's mother (Angela Clarke), who remained a major influence in his life.

With Bess as his assistant, Harry focused on becoming an escape artist and illusionist, working to master the opening of locks, handcuffs, and eventually safes.  Winning a prize provides the opportunity for the Houdini's to journey to England, where Harry gains more notoriety after escaping from a prison cell.  Performing in Europe, Houdini's career takes off.  While mostly based on some elements of truth, the film features a mysterious German magician named Johann Von Schweger, who Houdini unsuccessfully attempts to contact many times.  After Von Schweger passes away, in another strange development, Von Schweger's assistant Otto (Torin Thatcher), becomes Houdini's loyal aide.

Returning to America, the magician works to establish himself as a performer.  Tragedy strikes, when Houdini's mother passes away while he is in Detroit, attempting to escape from a crate dropped through a hole in the ice on a frozen river.  The stunt nearly claims Houdini's life, but he claims that his mother's voice mysteriously guided him to safety.  This event causes Houdini to stop performing, and explore the possibility of communicating with the spirits of the dead, and debunking fake mediums.  Houdini eventually returns to performing, attempting more spectacular tricks.  The dangerous pagoda water torture cell escape is eliminated from the act, until the audience demands that Houdini perform it.

Houdini the movie, is quite entertaining, and while not entirely accurate, gets a lot of things right while building up the mystique surrounding the famous magician.  It's understandable that Houdini's death from appendicitis was dramatized, and it doesn't matter that Bess was actually a brunette, but the whole Von Schweger storyline is a curious element, as the filmmakers seem bent of playing up the supernatural angle.  Rather than being the cause of his death, the water torture cell escape was a trick that Houdini successfully performed for many years.  The makeup effects are nicely done, as the Houdini's both age gracefully through the course of the film.  With some impressive set designs, and winning performances from Curtis and Leigh, Houdini rates a solid 4.5 stars.  The film would earn a 5 star rating, if not for the various factual inconsistencies.",1315699200,5,3142,5.279678068410463

3393439,5,B0016LFUVG,"When I was a kid, HOUDINI (1953) with Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh was always broadcast in October, usually as a Saturday afternoon movie.

There are two mentions in it of Halloween.
The first happens when Harry and Bess Houdini visit a magician's convention on Halloween night. Unhappy Harry failed at magic and took a job in a lock factory at his wife's urging, but when given the opportunity to go on stage as one of five challengers who must try to escape from strait jackets, Harry jumps at it. He wins the contest and his prize is a single round-trip ticket to Europe. Eventually the couple trades it for two one-way ducats. Harry and Bess find fame in Britain and on the Continent and then repeat their success in America.

The second Halloween reference is to a near-tragic stunt held on Halloween afternoon: an escape from a locked trunk submerged in the iced-over Detroit River. When he emerges from the trunk, Harry's swept downstream by the current, can't find the large hole cut in the ice and nearly drowns and/or freezes to death.

Despite that and a sad ending, this is generally an upbeat film. Colorful re-creations of late 19th Century sideshows are fun and so are the many magic tricks and escapes. Also, Leigh and Curtis make a most pulchritudinous couple and are clearly in love (for real!).

I recommend HOUDINI to all as a pleasant October diversion.

Also added to the magic is the short-fused comic relief of Frank Orth's lock factory owner, and the apoplectic Sig Ruman's side show proprietor with his Barney Google eyes.
