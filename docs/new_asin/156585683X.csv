7796530,4,156585683X,"The professor presenting this set of lectures seemed very well versed in Liszt's life. I have devoured books about Liszt for the past many years and found a couple things a did NOT know! Interesting,but not quite AAA material. I watched one lecture at a time and I was pleased with what I saw and heard. This  combination of lectures sparked an urge to read Alan Walker's  books on Liszt again! Aside from the very articulate and pretty detailed explanations, I noticed this guy very much respected Franz Liszt! Thank You for your enthusiasm! A note:  Graphics could be a little more professional(very plain and budget-concious looking) and You could note the performers on the music samples played in this series. There is a wide variety to choose from and it would be interesting to know the choices of this professor. Thanks again. You kept my attention!",1442707200,,857,4.816326530612245
7796531,5,156585683X,I've watched 5 of the 10 Great Masters courses and Dr. Greenberg clearly proves to be the most entertaining (bad puns and all) and most knowledgeable lecturer at Great Courses. He combines great personal insight and his huge knowledge of music to inform the viewer in ways that are just not merely educational but also enthralling. His biography of Franz Liszt helps us to appreciate the genius that Liszt was. Dr. Greenberg presents an entertaining perspective of Liszt's genius and revolutionary talents. Simply a superb course.. thanks for offering it.,1368489600,4,555,5.177777777777778
