810216,5,6304178379,"I've noticed that the only people who love this movie as much as I do are boxing fans. If you're a boxing fan then you're going to get all the little inside jokes about the sport that boxing fans can't miss. I think the movie more of a spoof on the Holmes-Cooney fight in 1982 than anything else. Yes the jokes are racial, but boxing is a racist sport. Not that anybody is discriminated against but boxing fans tend to support their own and this movie pokes fun at that. Lighten up people and enjoy the laughs",1165104000,3,509,4.257731958762887

810220,3,6304178379,"After watching Major Payne, I thought I would try another Damon Wayans' movie, but found this one a great disappointment.  The cast were all star, and the story line was good, but I think comically it could have done a bit  more.  Still a good movie, but certainly not anything the actors who  starred in it would be boasting about.",963619200,,332,4.483333333333333

810222,5,6304178379,"I can't understand Leonard Maltin's lack of enthusiasm for this movie, which features what may be the best work yet from Samuel Jackson and Jeff Goldblum.  The writers, obviously inspired by the Tyson-McNeeley fight,  offer us the anti-Rocky, the story of a nobody pitted against the world  boxing champion, and the crafty promoter who tries to con the public into  believing the outcome is in doubt and buying tickets to see them fight.  This film did badly at the box office and caught me a little off guard the  first time I saw it because it is so completely cynical, every character is  a fraud.  But once you realize there are no heroes in this story and accept  that it is hilarious.  Every time I see it the film gets funnier.  The  writers might want to do a sequel about women boxers.  As women's boxing  websites and newspaper coverage make clear, in women's boxing horrible  mismatches in which an unprepared gal is fed to an experienced pro in the  ring just to fill a fight card are commonplace and a continuing scandal.",943228800,6,1034,4.5989010989010985
810223,5,6304178379,"A well crafted movie with subtle references to real-life Boxing Promoter Don king. The movie has plenty of laughs with an ending that really should come as no surprise if one follows the fundamentals; however, that's just  what this movie does superbly... hides the fundamentals and makes one  follow the 'Hype'.",942105600,,312,5.098039215686274

Second, always get a kick out of Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. in pretty much anything they're in.

810283,5,6304178379,"This is an underappreciated classic. It pokes fun at boxing, the corruption of boxing, politics, how race is exploited positively and negatively both black and white, how everyone can be bought, and probably a bunch of other stuff that I've just forgotten.

It's got an all star cast too. Sam Jackson, Cheech Marin, Jamie Foxx, Jon Lovitz, Corbin Bersen, Jeff Goldblum, Damon Wayans....the list goes on.

Basically Damon Wayans is an undefeated champion boxer. Sam Jackson is his promoter, who finds a white guy that beat Damon Wayans in an amateur  boxing match before he turned pro. Jackson wants to promote a fight between them to increase the appeal of boxing to a wider audience. So he exploits that the fighter is a white guy and sells it to the max, hence making him the Great White Hype. Samuel Jackson markets the fighter as the guy who's going to take down the black champion, and calls him ""Irish Terry Conklin"" to which Conklin explains that he isn't Irish. He is told it's okay...that 'Irish' just means he's white.

Samuel Jackson plays everyone like a fiddle. His boxer. His boxer's opponent. The crew making a disparaging documentary about him (Jeff Goldblum). The boxing commission. The boxing fans. Gamblers. Literally everyone.

The end result is absolute hilarity!

It's one of those movies you've never heard of that you just have to watch! It's even got references to Dolomite's Karate Fighting Hos! What more could you want in a movie?!",1424736000,,1459,4.886639676113361

810320,5,6304178379,"Ha, ha, thinking about some of the scenes and characters in this movie always makes me laugh. I've seen it at least a dozen times and this past time I must have cried laughing. It keeps getting funnier. I read a whole lot of people trying to make sense of the movie and the point is, it's useless to try to make sense of something that's loosely based on some famous and other generalized personalities in the field of entertainment. It pokes fun at how easily we buy into a notion based on race or fame or for no better reason than it's popular. The entire movie makes sense, it flows and almost EVERY scene has something that I just have to see. After watching it again, I think the only character who tried to be sincere was Conklin and he wasn't very bright. However, even with the all-star cast (for the most part) it amazes me that I can show the movie to friends and family and some just don't get it.

Sultan, decides something new is needed to boost the marketability of the boxing matches, he searches and finds the only man to ever beat the champ. The problem is that he isn't a boxer anymore and he's white. However, once Rev. Sultan convinces him to fight, he goes into heavy training while the confident champ takes it easy and falls out of shape. A very funny movie that also has a rather keen insight into the current state of boxing. Even if you are not a boxing fan, you will enjoy this movie. Very funny movie and great acting performances.",1263427200,,581,4.542857142857143
810324,4,6304178379,"The amazon.com review for this film includes the line ""While sharp and funny, it's never quite clear what the point of it all is."" If this is all a GREAT WHITE HYPE viewer gets out of this movie, i'm afraid he/she just wasn't paying attention. While providing a nice satirical look at egomaniacal athletes and hustling boxing promoters (Sam Jackson is as brilliantly watchable as always here) throughout, the movie is all about how hype can make a non-event an event and the film's last ten minutes is the key. What, you were expecting a ROCKY denouement? In the end, this movie shows how sports fans -- and the entertainment-junkie public in general -- can be manipulated by loudness and money. Combined with Shelton's ever-sharp and fearless takes on America's racial tension (also see the brilliant WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP), THE GREAT WHITE HYPE is well worth a watch. And a think thereafter.",1206662400,3,892,4.836601307189542
810325,4,6304178379,"This is an odd movie. One of the qualities it shares with other motion pictures is that its parts don't add up to a great whole. However, what I find odd is that the parts are without question hilarious. There are many scenes in this film that simply do not support any other part of the movie. None the less, they had me laughing so hard that my ribs were hurting.

The movie tries to parody the sport of boxing and in particular the careers of ex-heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and boxing promoter Don King. The mockery of the two aforementioned larger than life personalities is readily apparent so it doesn't require much explanation if any. Earlier I used the word ""tries"" in its attempt to lampoon boxing. It's ironic that the sport of boxing as it stands is so cartoonish, attempts to ""send-up"" the game pretty much fail. If you're a fan of boxing and you watch this movie, you'll know exactly what I mean. A few examples of failed ribbing include the governing body in the movie (the WBI) giving a fighter with NO PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE a number one ranking so that a title fight can be sanctioned, the worthy challenger being ducked in this movie (Marvin Shabazz) coming to a press conference and getting knocked out by the fighter with no experience and last but not least, a gun-toting manager in the ring after a prize fight has concluded. Every follower of the sport knows that these events are mild compared to what actually happens in the real life sport. Cases in point, real life boxing one ups the number one ranked fighter with no professional experience in that there's a well known case of a dead boxer consistently moving up the ranks for 2 years after his death. Real life boxing (and I should point out that the ""real life"" designation is used loosely)  trumps the previously mentioned press conference knock-out by scores of press conference brawls. Finally, the gun-toting manager in the ring after the fight ends? Real life boxing has some of the wildest scenarios occuring before, during and after a fight has taken place. There are simply too many to mention but there have been brawls where managers use cell phones during attacks on the opposition causing full scale riots (Riddick Bowe  vs. Andrew Golota II) and a fighter who lost becoming so enraged that he sucker punches the winner with his gloves off after the verdict has been read, gets arrested in the ring, is convicted and sent to jail(Richard Grant vs. James Butler). I won't even mention ""fan man"" (Riddick Bowe vs. Evander Holyfield II). As you can see, boxing cartoons itself.

With that being said, the movie is still funny without adding up to much at all.",1190592000,2,2656,4.680942184154175
