7963522,5,B000067JHM,"My son, at 7 months, got hooked on this while it was temporarily available on cable. When it went off the air, I had to order the DVD. Now I give out copies for presents.",1166140800,,170,3.8857142857142857
7963523,5,B000067JHM,"We own all of the Baby Genius videos, and I rate this one the best.  It's soothing, and interesting, and easy to narrate.  My boys are two and 8 months old, and enjoy watching it as I point out colors and animals.  We also review sign language with this video (hot, cold, snow, cold, bee, etc.  We like it.",1074902400,2,306,4.135593220338983
7963524,4,B000067JHM,"After listening to countless hours of synthesized classical music, I am refreshed with the appearance of the Baby Genius videos.  These are real musicians playing real music.  The quality is excellent.  The video images may not be as refined as the Baby Einstein line of tapes, but my 2 and 4 year olds both enjoy watching them.  If the kids leave the room, it's no problem.  This is a tape that is as enjoyable to listen to as it is to watch.",1029196800,6,443,4.353658536585366
7963525,2,B000067JHM,My son is 10 months and has been listening/watching Baby Genius since he was 2 months.  He loves Mozart and Friends and Sleepytime so we were shocked when he cried when we put in Four Seasons.  He will have nothing to do with it; maybe Vivaldi is a little intense for him right now.,1028764800,3,282,4.203703703703703
