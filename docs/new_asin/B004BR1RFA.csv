4319993,3,B004BR1RFA,"Good to see this film, but sadly as with many older films the quality of the master has degraded.  Sound wasn't too good and at some points hard to understand.",1387324800,,159,4.3
4319994,4,B004BR1RFA,I was really surprised to be enjoying this movie. It's an older but a Better one than most are today. I grew up watching old black and white movies as being a kid. I surely would recommend anyone to watch this movie to understand the differences from yesterday and today and the actual art of a movie.,1382227200,,301,4.298245614035087
4319995,4,B004BR1RFA,Enjoyed this mystery--loved the English accents and the way they quietly went back and forth between English and French . If you like old mysteries you will enjoy this one--I did. It is an old movie and hasn't been remastered so keep that in mind.,1378771200,13,247,4.511111111111111
4319996,4,B004BR1RFA,"Nice mystery. I enjoy the older movies 1940 and 1950 times. The acting was  good, and much better than todays overpaid actors.",1371945600,5,126,4.7272727272727275
4319997,4,B004BR1RFA,I found this to be better than expected.  The actor who plays the lead detective named Inspector Hanuad adds just about the right amount of humor and intrigue into the story line.  Inspector Hanuad's french didn't sound quite french.  An atmospheric murder mystery.,1370908800,16,265,5.116279069767442
4319998,4,B004BR1RFA,"I'm constantly on the look-out for atmospheric thrillers, those scarcely remembered black-and-white movie mysteries of the 30s, 40's and 50s.  The House of the Arrow is one of these (as is the Mask of Dimitrios). There's something fascinating about a director's use of light and shadows to heighten the tension in a movie plot and its dark goings-on.  The House of the Arrow is a classy gem of a movie, largely forgotten.  Alfred Hitchcock would've liked it, I know.  What else can I say?  One either likes film noire-ish movies or doesn't.  The lesser-known stars of this film do a first-rate job in their roles, so if you like Hitchcock films you'll like this one as well.",1352419200,35,674,4.717948717948718
4319999,5,B004BR1RFA,"Great twists in this black-and-white English noir. I am always on the lookout for these. If you enjoy '30s-'40s atmospheric film, you'll enjoy this one. Oscar Homolka is perfect in this one and my reason for the five stars.",1465948800,2,223,4.743589743589744
4320000,4,B004BR1RFA,It is of its period- a fun murder mystery that has a couple of twists in it.,1463788800,,76,3.5294117647058822
4320001,4,B004BR1RFA,OK,1461801600,,2,2.0
4320002,5,B004BR1RFA,"Loved this movie. It's an old copy so beware of that. But I didn't care!! :)

It challenged my very rudimentary French a bit since it had no subtitles when it switched from English to French, but it was still great.

As another reviewer stated, if you like Hitchcock you will like this.

I also liked the humor that the French detective brought into it.

Overall you should watch this!",1450656000,,385,4.457142857142857
4320003,1,B004BR1RFA,Very dated and very bad condition.,1448150400,,34,4.833333333333333
4320004,5,B004BR1RFA,"Oskar plays a comedic detective in this Paris mystery...  I always remembered him as a heavy...
Funny and lots of fun to watch.",1447632000,,127,4.521739130434782
4320005,4,B004BR1RFA,it's really good if u like old mystery movies,1441670400,,45,4.111111111111111
4320006,5,B004BR1RFA,predictable but good except for the horrible so called music,1441584000,,60,5.1

4320008,1,B004BR1RFA,terrible,1439164800,,8,8.0
4320009,5,B004BR1RFA,"Great plot, and unique detective whose wit matches the music, both of which are merry and at odds with the story and film noir tone. This makes the movie especially appealing. I really recommend it. Also great is how it is set in Paris but is a film noir. Just keep in mind it is an old film that has not been refurbished - I love that viewing experience but it can be annoying.",1436832000,5,378,4.121621621621622
4320010,4,B004BR1RFA,Pretty good movie.,1434499200,,18,5.333333333333333

4320012,4,B004BR1RFA,I liked the contrast and the simplicity and the double speak in the solving of the murder. Nice little movie.,1434412800,,109,4.5
4320013,2,B004BR1RFA,"Poor picture audio quality.. Otherwise, decent film.",1433030400,,52,6.571428571428571

4320016,1,B004BR1RFA,Never viewed movie. The film would not load properly for streaming. Picture would start then freeze. No audio at all.,1420156800,,117,4.9

4320022,1,B004BR1RFA,I never ordered this book so can not really give you any rating.,1412899200,,64,4.0
4320023,4,B004BR1RFA,"entertaining and atmospheric, recommended",1412467200,,41,9.5
4320024,4,B004BR1RFA,"Inspector Hanaud (Oskar Homolka) is on the case when a beautiful heiress named Betty Harlowe (played by the incredibly beautiful Yvonne Furneaux) is accused and quickly cleared of the murder of her adopted mother. However, he becomes convinced that mum was indeed murdered, and must solve the mystery. Homolka's Hanaud is as humorous as he is doggedly determined. THE HOUSE OF THE ARROW is an excellent detective story, w/ a method of homicide that's out of the ordinary. The finale took me completely by surprise! Well worth watching...",1411862400,5,537,5.113636363636363
4320025,5,B004BR1RFA,Oskar as a French good guy.  What more could a vintage film buff want?,1408752000,,70,4.0
4320026,5,B004BR1RFA,Fascinating and gripping tale of murder and deceit.  Loved it.  It would still make a good movie today.,1408406400,,103,4.666666666666667
4320027,4,B004BR1RFA,"The famous, renowned French inspector skillfully recognizes facts from fabricated lies as he evaluates all suspects.  The inspector isn't Clouseau or Poirot but he has all their traits and cunning. That makes it a worthwhile movie to watch.",1405641600,,240,5.315789473684211
4320028,4,B004BR1RFA,"Interesting mystery: was it a natural death? how about poison?  Good performance from Oskar Homalka
Some scenes are not well-lit enough to see what's happening, and the film is.hampered by a scratchy soundtrack.",1405555200,,211,5.393939393939394
4320029,4,B004BR1RFA,Film quality is the only reason for the lack of an extra star.  Too bad there isn't a better copy somewhere.,1399766400,,108,4.142857142857143
4320030,3,B004BR1RFA,"Oskar Homolka makes a great sleuth. A rather short in height man, he nevertheless dominates the scenes he is in with his gestures, his expressions, including an engaging grin.. He is rather like a bulldog and he is someone you definitely would not be wise to pick a fight with but he is all smiles as he bustles round gathering evidence of the murder of an old lady. Black and white is the hallmark of noir films and the use of contrasts of light and dark and shadows creates the perfect atmosphere in which to envelop a murder mystery.",1398643200,9,536,4.424242424242424
4320031,5,B004BR1RFA,"I love this movie. After a slow start, probably because I am not use to the slow pacing of yester-year, the movie kept me interested throughout. Goes to show how low tech old movies can be intriguing and entertaining...and...even in black and white...spellbinding! Viva Old School movies!!",1398470400,,289,5.170212765957447
4320032,4,B004BR1RFA,Boris Karloff is the quintessential 'kill em with kindness' detective.  Always a step or two ahead of the law. I'd much rather watch an old movie than TV,1394582400,,153,4.464285714285714
4320033,4,B004BR1RFA,Interesting story and plot. And the real culprit was a surprise.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Nothing like the old movies.,1393113600,,115,4.428571428571429
4320034,5,B004BR1RFA,"Oscar Homalka is a smooth sleuth,  The French language is soothing.  Plot quite engaging in post-war era, ladies beautiful and men dashing.  And The detective a likable, continental benevolent and wise rogue.  The movie kept my interest and I feel relaxed after watching it.  Also want to search more about Oscar Homalka.  Before I imagined him maybe a Slovak..............but he may be French or......?  Also the moody accordion background music is near to my heart.",1391817600,,467,5.1466666666666665
4320035,4,B004BR1RFA,"It was refreshing to find an old Swedish movie!  I enjoyed this old classic very much, please provide more films like this in Prime. Thank you",1390262400,2,142,4.461538461538462
4320036,4,B004BR1RFA,"Was a really good late night, couldn't get back to sleep movie to watch on the computer. Really enjoyed it.",1389830400,,107,4.4
4320037,4,B004BR1RFA,"I love old movies and this one is just grand to watch - we live in a fast paced, action packed world and watching this slows down that process...watch more for the quality of 'some' of the actors, more used to stage than film...different era, different way to view...",1389657600,,267,4.469387755102041
8422212,4,B004BR1RFA,"Loved Homolka's police detective; this could have been the beginning of a series - could have competed with many of the Christie characters.  I wonder why a sequel was never done?  Reminds me of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto.  Homolka was an excellent actor; he is definitely the reason for watching this.  All in all, not a bad movie, but this version, as has been mentioned, leaves much to be desired as to the sound.",1527206400,,415,4.493333333333333
8422213,4,B004BR1RFA,"A couple of undermentioned things are the highly dramatic cinematography and the well timed music - both were used to create eerie moods with great effect.
This film is a real jewel and deserves a full restoration.",1523059200,,214,4.8108108108108105
8422214,3,B004BR1RFA,"Story has great atmosphere, sets.  Many interesting twists but kind of predictable outcome.  Poor film and sound quality.",1522022400,,121,5.666666666666667
8422215,5,B004BR1RFA,"Others have complained about the sound quality--it is no worse than I expected from a film from this era, just a bit scratchy thorughout  The acting is good, the story well-written and entertaining.",1517702400,,198,5.0
8422216,1,B004BR1RFA,"Junk.  Have you found out yet that Amazon puts its own ""five star"" at the top of every film even before it's watched for the first time by the public?  Why do they try to deceive?  I must take for granted that they do this with ALL the reviews from buttons to bikes.  Just lie to sell the things....typical for the caliber of people in this world now.",1504310400,,351,4.117647058823529
8422217,5,B004BR1RFA,Right up my alley. Perfect for leaving the troubles of the world behind.,1485734400,,72,4.615384615384615
8422218,4,B004BR1RFA,Very good.  Ending was a surprise.,1479600000,,34,4.666666666666667
8422219,1,B004BR1RFA,"It may have been a decent movie, however the sound track was so poor that I couldn't hear a thing and had to turn it off.",1478563200,,121,3.6923076923076925
8422220,1,B004BR1RFA,The sound was terrible.,1468540800,,23,5.0
8422221,4,B004BR1RFA,A gem of a dark noir mystery. Always great fun to figure out 'who dunnit' & this one doesn't disappoint.,1468108800,,104,4.25
