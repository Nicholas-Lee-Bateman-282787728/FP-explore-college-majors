2763405,1,B000NA78SE,"I totally agree with the below-named commentor. I have all the seasons, except the latest ones that have not come out yet, and I feel that I was so cheated on season 5. Of course that does not matter because they are off the air, and opinion might not matter. They will matter if they are aired for others that are considering buy the DVD's. I say don't waste your money on five because if you are not a Karen and Jack Show fan, you will be totally lost.",1174867200,6,454,4.112359550561798
2763406,1,B000NA78SE,"How can you rate something that hasn't been released?  Especially since Lionsgate RUINED Season 5 by releasing the shortened syndicated versions while still writing on the box ""The Complete 5th Season"".  Debbie Harry is credited on the box while her scene was omitted.  This along with many others...

They completely ruined the boxed set by issuing shortened, crappy syndicated episodes.  This is coming from a huge W&G fan, or should I say K&J fan.",1174867200,8,450,5.027027027027027
2763407,4,B000NA78SE,"Finally, the studio is speeding up the releases! I thought we'd have to wait another year for the next season.

In my opinion, this was the last season that had truly great writing in many of the episodes. Some of my favourite episodes include: ""Home Court Disadvantage"", ""A-Story, Bee-Story"", ""Fanilow"", ""Speechless"", and the two-part finale. The two best episodes for me were ""Nice in White Satin"" and ""Last Ex to Brooklyn""- both had wonderful writing and great guest spots by Jack Black and Mira Sorvino, respectively. This was really a standout season for Megan Mullally, with Debra Messing away for quite a few episodes because of her pregnancy. Mullally was featured much more prominently in many of the story archs, and was given some of the best lines of the series' run. I really didn't watch much of season seven or eight because the writing just isn't great after season six. Really looking forward to this release, but I'm only giving it four stars because the special features on the Will and Grace sets are so minimal- love the gag reel but the themed featurettes are dull-- montages of clips from the episodes are not EXTRA features.",1171670400,36,1148,4.8274111675126905
2763408,5,B000NA78SE,"Is there any word on when Will & Grace Season 6 is going to be released in the US?  I guess I'm having a hard time understanding why ALL 8 seasons are available in other region formats, but not in US Region 1 format.  What's the holdup?  The show has been over for almost a year and still Lionsgate wants to poke around until the show's popularity loses steam before they release the last 3 seasons?  Hello!

I did not notice but I forgot that 7 n 8th seasons I missed buying so I just ordered them, I just love these actors and only 2 of them are really gay, Will is not nor is his crazy lil' bro the oh so ever totally acting gay character who is not gay. He is so funny and cute and I hear he has a new sitcom I am looking forward to watching it and he has not aged a bit. I hope to see his best Friend Karen in it for they were like such pals and played off of each others characters. You should check first to see if your choice in buying single and love the programs look for them in sets it is way cheaper. hope you enjoy Will & Grace as much as I have and do. As I said only two of the characters were gay and it was not Will or his pal or any of the main characters. I still do not know .. have fun! GUESSING",1387324800,,943,3.691542288557214

Two great shows on one night.  Being able to continue watching Will and Grace on dvd is a great thing, it will be a show that will go down as one of the great sitcoms in history.

The only points I'm bummed about is that Debra Messing was not in this season as much (due to her pregnancy in real life) and that the so called extra features aren't really extras at all.",1191542400,,307,3.9516129032258065

2763686,4,B000NA78SE,"I was a little surprised at what they claimed was a ""special feature"".  Apparently interactive menus--standard menus for a DVD really--are special now.

Still, I didn't buy it for the features.  I bought it for Jack and Karen, who help keep my life fun and and drama free.",1181260800,2,272,4.625
2763687,5,B000NA78SE,I absolutely love this dvd set...just as I love all Will and Grace seasons. This show is hysterical and makes me laugh at the top of my lungs. I would highly recommend it.,1181260800,,171,4.212121212121212
2763688,5,B000NA78SE,Love everything about Season 6 especially the Fanilow episode.  The bloopers are always hilarious and the themed featurettes are always entertaining.  Can't wait for Season 7 and 8 to come out!!,1181174400,,194,5.225806451612903
2763699,5,B000NA78SE,"When this originally aired on NBC I was losing interest in the show. I thought it went down-hill after Grace got married. But, I bought it, like all previous seasons and IT IS FUNNY!!! This show cracks me up and every episode is worth watching. I especially enjoy Karen & Jack, more so than Will & Grace. I'll be looking forward to buying the remaining seasons. I wish they wouldn't have relied so much on GUEST STARS in the final seasons. This is one of the last great comedies for me. I don't think anything on the air today is half as witty and comical as this show!!!",1181001600,,571,4.296296296296297
2763700,5,B000NA78SE,"I love will and grace! It's amazing! This is definitely not one of the BEST seasons, due to the fact that Debra Messing is pregnant and misses a few episodes in the end, but it is still definitely worth watching.",1180656000,,212,4.325

2763703,4,B000NA78SE,"This was a sometimes Grace-less season (babytime) but it still measured up to all other sitcoms. Karen and Jack are funnier and funnier. Will is well Will the rock of senseability until he's expose as just as wacky as the others.

I liked the first 3 seasons more but still I found season six very enjoyable. (And Amazon gave me a very good price.)",1180396800,,348,4.4375
2763704,5,B000NA78SE,"Came the day the DVD was released. There seemed to be one error on the first disc, but other than that product was good.",1178928000,,120,4.041666666666667
2763705,2,B000NA78SE,"As much as I love WILL & GRACE and am glad to see another season make its way to DVD, I'm disappointed, yet again, with such an inferior release. The ""super-size"" season premier, ""Dames at Sea,"" appears as the syndicated version on the DVD, just like all of the butchered episodes found on last year's season 5 DVD release. Also, a handful of episodes from mid-season were originally supposed to air as ""super-size"" episodes (both parts of ""Flip Flop"" and ""East Side Story"" to name a few), but they were aired as standard episodes to accommodate NBC's schedule for FRIENDS and THE APPRENTICE, thus parts of these episodes have never been aired and these scenes were not included in the season 6 DVD set. And like those found in seasons 2-4 DVD sets, the one-hour episode from this year, the season finale ""I Do. Oh, No, You Di-in't,"" is split up into two separate 30-minute episodes.

Back in February when this release was announced, I wrote a letter to LionsGate telling them how disappointed fans have been with the season releases and asking them to give us what we want-- episodes in their entirety. But upon recently learning that LionsGate is only the distributor and that NBC is responsible for the actual content of the DVDs, I realize that my plea for better DVD releases didn't fall on deaf ears-- it fell on the wrong ears! At this point, having uncut season sets is a lost cause since only seasons 7 and 8 remain to be released, but if people begin contacting NBC now and demand that they fix all of these problems with a complete series set (which I'm sure they plan to do eventually), then maybe we can get full-length versions of all of these beloved, hilarious episodes.

Much like the previous releases, this season 6 set has few extras, despite the untrue ""Loaded with extra features"" that appears on the cover of this, and every, season set. The only positive aspect of this set is that the interactive menus are the slickest and most eye-appealing of all of the season sets.

As for the season itself, season 6 isn't one of my favorites. While this season does include some gems (""Last Ex to Brooklyn"" and ""Strangers with Candice"" are two of my favorites), it also includes some duds. At certain points throughout the season, the writing is sub par, and the show's dynamic is thrown out of whack when Debra Messing is absent from some episodes due to her pregnancy. People often say that Karen and Jack made the show what it was, but I think it was a team effort that required all four of the main actors to make the show the hilarious and witty sitcom that it was, and this season demonstrates that quite clearly when Grace's absence hinders the overall tone and quality of the show. I would have given this three, maybe even four, stars had the season been released in its entirety, but NBC seems to think we like paying good money for syndicated episodes.",1177977600,46,2879,4.597276264591439
2763706,5,B000NA78SE,"This is one of the best season of Will and Grace.  I can't wait for it to be realeased on Dvd.  It is sooooo funny!!!  I have seasons 1-5 and love all of them, but I do think this is probably one of the best seasons!!!!!!!!!!!",1177459200,,226,3.869565217391304
2763707,5,B000NA78SE,"Will & Grace: Season 6 was the last season with great writing and even better ratings. Season 7 & 8 saw a decline in ratings and overall value. Season 6 was good because it had interesting story arcs. Jack becoming a student nurse, Karen and Lyle Finster forming a relationship, Will finally finding love and Grace beginning to discover problems in her marriage with Leo. There were a few very memorable episodes in season 6, one of my top faves being ""Fanilow"", and it's sad to see how this great, groundbreaking, hilarious series slightly went downhill in the last two years of it's run. Also, I hope season 6 has the full-length ""super-sized"" episodes as opposed to season 5's syndicated, edited versions. Consumers don't want that.",1175558400,9,735,4.841269841269841
2763708,5,B000NA78SE,"This season packs some of the best episodes of the show. It's probably the show's pinnacle season as seasons 7 & 8 weren't so hot.
