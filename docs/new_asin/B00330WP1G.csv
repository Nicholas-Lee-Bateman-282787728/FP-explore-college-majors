8472933,2,B00330WP1G,"Great movie, however, I was disappointed that it was advertised as ""under 14,"" but was not.  I bought movie with the intention of showing it to my 9th and 10th grade math classes.  I could not, in good conscience, show a movie in school in which there is so much profanity.  I would not have purchased the movie if I had known that the profanities had not been removed.  I am unhappy about the false advertising.  I already spend a lot of my own money for classroom supplies -- this was an unnecessary expense for me.",1423785600,,517,4.34375
