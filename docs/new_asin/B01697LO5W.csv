7464410,4,B01697LO5W,"I have been working out with Tracy Anderson DVDs for about six years. I own about 7 of her DVDs and have been pleased with the results. Boot Camp is a great addition to my collection.
  Boot Camp is divided into three,twenty minute segments, has,hips,and butt. The moves are more complex then the Method Express, Precision toning,or Mat workout but not necessarily more effective. The abs and hip segments had lots of new exercises while the butt had more familiar, tried and true moves.
I would recommend this video to someone with Tracy Anderson experience, Method Express for a beginner(shorter segments,less complex moves). While each segment did included arm exercises, I wish their was a designated chapter. All in all this was a great workout and added more variety to my exercise routine. I still prefer Precision Toning, Mat,and method express over Boot Camp, still very pleased.",1451606400,19,888,5.034013605442177
7464411,5,B01697LO5W,"This is a great 1 hour mat workout OR 3 separate 20 min sections - the first part is abs, the 2nd is ""hips & thighs"", the 3rd is ""glutes"" - but the last 2 sections are basically whole body workouts classic Tracy power moves.  I love it because it is different than all her other mat workouts, including the meta program. The ab section got me sweating, but it was not too difficult and definitely had an ab focus.  Very controlled moves, this entire workout she explains the moves and breaks it all down, so it is slower paced than the meta mat workouts but not necessarily easier!  The last two sections are definitely full body, while you focus on one leg moving she combines the other side of the body in her very effective weight transfer/balance moves so that your abs, back, arms, the whole body is challenged to work together. New moves from her other workouts - I'm always amazed to see what she comes up with, was not disappointed.",1451606400,47,940,4.421965317919075
7464412,5,B01697LO5W,I have most of Tracy's DVDs. Love this work out! It was challenging which is what I really need!!!,1486684800,,98,4.2105263157894735

7464414,5,B01697LO5W,Great workout. Only 3 segments makes the hour fly by!,1479600000,,53,4.4
7464415,5,B01697LO5W,"Tracy is controversial but she's unique and as a trainer with a pear shaped body, I totally agree with her concept of floor exercises to trim and lean out your hips and thighs.  I don't agree with her 3 lb handweight rule, but I do her upper body workouts as a warmup for lifting heavier weights.  Overall a great lower body workout program.  (I have also done metamorphasis, which I love - this is different)",1478044800,5,409,4.426666666666667

7464417,1,B01697LO5W,"I have almost every Tracy Anderson DVD. I get bored easily and like her unique style. That being said, this DVD is a complete waste of money. She stops for so long inbetween different moves that I thought my DVD had paused multiple times. If you looking for a sweat, which you would think you would get in a boot camp workout, you're in for a big disappointment. I wouldn't call any of the ""3 Complete 20-Minute Workouts"" (a 20 minute workout focused on Abs, Hips & Thighs, and then Glutes) even a low impact workout.  The extremely long pauses inbetween moves while Tracy is just speaking makes it impossible to get your heart rate up at all and as a result, each of the ""focused workouts"" feels choppy with no flow to any of them. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone. It was a waste of money and a huge disappointment for me.",1476403200,16,831,4.361290322580645
7464418,3,B01697LO5W,Good workout but I got sores on both knees doing this...so doing the whole video at one time is something I don't do anymore. I mix it up with other workouts cause I like to do an hour at a time.,1473033600,,195,3.7804878048780486

7464420,2,B01697LO5W,I have several Tracy DVDs & this one is so disappointing. She spends SO much time over explaining the most simple moves. It cuts into the workout & ruins the flow. The workouts are only 20 minutes & she spends a good portion of that warming up & cooling down. Plus she stops every exercise to explain every detail. I didn't feel like I even worked out. There was so much time sitting there waiting for her to shut up so we could start the next move. Such a waste of money.,1470960000,9,472,4.141304347826087
7464421,5,B01697LO5W,Love love love it!! Maybe the packaging can be better so it's not all wrinkled up but hoping that it will flatten out soon. Other than that it's perfect.,1469491200,,153,4.310344827586207

7464423,5,B01697LO5W,Yes it did!!! Love it. More challenging than her other DVDs!!! Definitely would recommend it whole heartily,1467676800,5,107,5.352941176470588

7464426,5,B01697LO5W,This dvd was not easy at first but I kept doing it and learned the exercises in correct form and I could feel them working,1462924800,3,122,3.92

7464428,2,B01697LO5W,I don't understand why TA thinks that complicated and awkward exercises are best?! This DVD is horrible for the knees and the hands.,1459036800,5,132,4.782608695652174

7464430,3,B01697LO5W,"This is not one of my favorite dvd of Tracy's, and I have many. Tracy patents her exercise moves, so they become more complex than they need to be. Some I like and some I don't. I end up doing them my way, rather than following her. The big drawback of this dvd is there is no arm section. Yes, I know there's not supposed to be one, but there should be. Because of that, I tend to use her Mat or Precision Toning, both are much better than this one, to get a good arm workout. I also add Barre routines in my weekly workout, to give my muscles a change from Tracy's. All in all, it's okay, but doesn't flow as well as her other ones. I wish she would make more Mat workouts like her first one.",1457740800,8,694,3.9642857142857144
7464431,5,B01697LO5W,"Each workout lasts 20 minutes, so this is a good video to have on hand if you only have time for a short workout. Each workout has a warm up and cool down, and Tracy does a good job of explaining each move. These are workouts that will definitely leave you sore the next day!  You will need light handweights as well as (optional) ankle weights. There is no specific arm sequence but arms are incorporated into each segment, to a lesser degree.",1456099200,3,444,4.349397590361446
7464432,5,B01697LO5W,"Great video. But, don't think this is for beginners.",1454976000,,52,4.888888888888889
7464433,4,B01697LO5W,I'm a huge Tracy Anderson fan and this dvd workout is nice to have to add to her collection.,1454284800,,92,3.8947368421052633

7464435,5,B01697LO5W,"Tracy Anderson's methods are just meant for me mentally and physically.  I am a mover and love things like dance, high energy yoga, gymnastics and Martial Arts when I was a kid and teen.  Hand me a pair of weights and traditional cardio moves and I will do it to stay fit but it's annoying.  Put me on a treadmill, forget about it.  I like activities that are precision movements that require mastery to really utilize and keep you mentally stimulated.  Tracy Anderson's workouts are exactly that. I change the DVDs (routines) up every 10 days like she does with her membership programs.  I do 1 hour of her muscular structure type videos so 1 whole dvd like Method Express, Precision Toning, Targeted Training Boot Camp, etc.  Then I do 20mins of Cardio Dance Express (6, 10min routines) or Slim Sculpt Cardio (3, 20min routines) then I cool down with stretching for 10mins.  This routine 5-7 days per week has shown me incredible results.  I'm nearing the end of my first month and I can see the shape of my body changing.  My thighs are starting to narrow and are definitely firmer.  My really skinny calves are getting bigger and my butt is lifting and rounding out in a good way.  My abs aren't hard yet but they have those long grooves down both sides and my stomach is flatter.  My arms are toning up all over and my pectoral muscles (boob lift) are gaining mass. If I keep this up my body is going to look like a model and since college I have always been slightly on the verge of chubby.  Also, most days I changed my breakfast to a power smoothie with Milk, a little whey, fruit and veggies.  Lunch is lots of veggies and lean protein like a salad or grilled veggies with chicken. Dinner is whatever I want and however much I want before 7pm, even bread and dessert!  I didn't want to count calories and I wanted my health habits to be about balance, fun, and energy.  I gave up my scale and desire to lose weight and made it about feeling good and it has been amazing.  Working out first thing in the morning + eating lean for breakfast and lunch keeps my energy up throughout the entire day so I am really productive and energetic.  I love cooking or eating out and ordering whatever the heck I want for dinner.  I can't wait to see my body after month two and feel so lucky to have found a routine that really fits me.  I will say you get what you put into these workout.  The first time around you are getting through the routine but as you get better you realize how to get the most out of each move. Tilting your foot this way, lifting it just that much higher so you feel your butt engage. . .it's little things like angles and height, toe pointed or flexed, rotation of the leg, adding up to 2.5lb ankle weights when ready.  As your perfect and grow stronger there is always a way to get more out of a move so you can get a lot out of these DVDs no matter what your fitness level.  Hope this helps someone out there that is searching for something unique like this :)",1454025600,20,2985,4.308243727598566
7464436,1,B01697LO5W,"Il doit tre trs bien mais je suis super due car il n'est pas possible de le lire en France sur mon lecteur DVD car protge!! Pourquoi le protger avec la zone 1. Tracy Anderson is international , his DVD myst be ras everywhere!!! Si I am really desappointed!!",1453852800,,257,4.26530612244898
7464437,3,B01697LO5W,I love Tracy but this DVDs is a little to easy for me. However with that said if you are a beginner to the method then this is actually a great place to start in my opinion.,1453420800,3,173,3.7027027027027026
7464438,3,B01697LO5W,"I love Tracy Anderson and regularly use her continuity, method express, mat  and level 2/3 design series workouts.  This is 3 20 minute workouts--abs, hips and glutes.  I thought the moves were challenging and typical Tracy Anderson intermediate level.  Not as hard as the higher level design series. I think it is most like the prediction toning workout.  I wish it had an arm section as I really use TA for arms.  Finally, I hate the background setting.  I workout at home in the early morning and this is set against a wall with dirty/ chipping paint. I know this may sound picky but I can't stand it. Why not something pretty like the method express DVD or at least a studio like most of her DVDs. The setting is a failure.",1452902400,3,727,4.462121212121212
7464439,4,B01697LO5W,"If you've been doing Tracy's Metamorphosis, Continuity and Streaming, this will be too easy. I add 3# hand weights at the beginning when she is doing the warm up for the abd section. I then use one 3# weight for the ab ex's ( hold behind your head for crunches, etc. ) and also wear light ankle weights. For the last two sections, I hold 3# weights whenever she is warming up/cooling down and hold one 3# when doing lower/full body moves. I also wear the second set of ankle weights the whole time through the last section. That way I feel like I am getting the same effect as the Master Class in Streaming or the Year 3/4 in Continuity. MUSIC: I either mute or turn her volume down so that I can barely hear her voice while I play my own music. That works really well.",1452729600,,769,4.202702702702703
7464440,5,B01697LO5W,"I did this shortly after it arrived and it's great! I workout daily (at home) and I thought it was the perfect routine. It was challenging yet doable. I failed to complete all the reps on a couple exercises but it was only the first day of doing it :) I think doing this a few times per week will definite produce results. You can't go wrong with this DVD for the price!
 I also purchased Precision Toning, looking forward to trying it tomorrow.",1452643200,4,445,4.2976190476190474
7464441,3,B01697LO5W,"Not what I expected. There are three 20 minute workouts to play together or not. They run into each other if played together, and it doesn't really seem like each is a different workout.
Kind of bad editing. She had leg weights on in the 2nd workout, then the third started and they were magically off. This workout just didn't seem to flow.
For it to be called ""Boot Camp"" I was expecting something hard. It was more like Beginner Boot Camp. Too much explaining and counting of every move. Very annoying. Seems like something for a beginner, if that is what you are looking for.
Pro is that the price dropped after I pre-ordered it for $9.99 and I got it for $7.50. Thanks Amazon. They refunded me the difference.",1452470400,5,714,4.458015267175573

Keep in mind I am small and didn't have extra weight in my stomach but lines were not there before. I am alternating Tracys workouts.
