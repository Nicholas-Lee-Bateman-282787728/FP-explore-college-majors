643606,1,6303433758,"This is the single worst WCW event in history. Let's go over the card Dustin Runnels vs Barry Darsow in a moving truck match- The single stupidest gimmick match in history!!!  Both of these could have been killed  and the whole point to ring a cowbell was so stupid Hacksaw Duggan vs Meng-  A Martial Arts match on a Wrestling show?  I'll pass.  7 minutes of  absolute boring action.  Arn Anderson vs Johnny B Badd in a boxer vs  wrestler match.  This match had rounds!!!  No real point to it, cause you  had to pin your opponent, not knock him out! Stupid. Randy Savage vs  Avalanche- The ONE good match on this card.  Both men put on a good show,  till it was ruined by Ric Flair dressed in drag!! Harlem Heat vs Nasty  Boys- Falls Count anywhere.  If they were trying to get extreme, I think  this was the biggest joke of a match ever.  The only EXTREME part about it  is the fact that they used PLASTIC garbage cans and fought in the  SOUVENIR/Concesstion stands!!  OOOOO!!! Sting vs Big Bubba- No DQ.  Not too  bad of a match, Big Bubba actually doesn't have to job in this match, but  still it could have been better. This leads us to the MAIN ATTRACTION!!!  Hogan vs Vader in the strap match.  The thing about this that really sucks  is that Hogan didn't beat Vader.  He beat Ric Flair!!!  And they counted it  as a win!! WCW never ceases to amaze me with their stupidity and overall  crappy product.  If you wanna see a good video, buy some WWF ones, they are  always entertaining and give you your money's worth.  This video is only  worth renting, since it only has 2 watchable matches!",914803200,,1596,4.3493150684931505

UNCENDORED 95

Like others have stated before WWE had their Extreme Rules night of gimmick matches event WCW had Uncensored, this was the first.

1.[KING OF THE ROAD MATCH]DUSTIN RHODES VS THE BLACKTOP BULLY-the concept for this match was very interesting. They would do battle on the back of an 18 wheeler flatbed trying to blow a horn to win the match. The match was actually not as bad as some would say, it is nowhere near the best thing ever but they try. The Bully ends up winning the match, interesting way to kick off the PPV.

2.[MARTIAL ARTS MATCH]JIM DUGGAN VS MENG-this match was basically to put over Meng. He dominated most of the match with heavy fan favorite Duggan coming up the loser after both his arms were held by Mengs manager Rob Parker and guest ref Sonny Ono.

3.[BOXER VS WRESTLER MATCH]JOHNNYB. BADD VS ARN ANDERSON-I remember thinking at the time even though I liked Badd, why would fans root against Arn, he represents wrestling here. Any way this match was an entertaining one with Badd controlling the first two rounds easy with his boxing skills. But once Arn started attacking him during the breaks he would take control. Of course once that bucket got put on his head that lead to a KO win for Badd.

4.[NO DQ MATCH]RANDY SAVAGE VS AVALANCHE-this match was supposed to be a no DQ match but that would not be true. Now some fans have said that this match was a little too slow but I actually really liked this match. Sure it was not the best but I enjoyed it. Avalanche beat on Savage for most of the match but Savage would battle back throughout. Eventually a woman would come out of the crowd and attack the Macho Man only to be revealed as Ric Flair. After a Hogan run in to save Randy he would be awarded the match by DQ of all things.

5.[ANYTHING GOES MATCH]STING VS BIG BUBBA ROGERS-this match was a decent back and forth until Sting injures his leg. From there it is mainly Rogers who gets the pin after Sting cant hold him up. Good match over all with the fans really behind the Stinger.

6.[FALLS COUNT ANYWHERE TEXAS TORNADO MATCH]HARLEM HEAT VS THE NASTY BOYS-this was a wild brawl between both teams including Sherri on behalf of her team Harlem Heat. The match goes all over the place and ends up in the concession stands. It is there after a few slips and slides that then Nasties get the win.

7.[STRAP MATCH]HULK HOGAN VS VADER-this was a feud that could have been great as they could have made some real money together but behind the scenes these guys did not want to lose to the other. Still the match is entertaining, mainly due to Flair but I liked it. I am a huge Vader fan so back in the day I was rooting for him. Somehow Hogan is allowed to win the match with Flair strapped to him as Bobby keeps pointing out. I did like the ending with Savage although most didnt.

Over all this was not one of the best events from WCW but there was some enjoyable matches in my opinion.",1464912000,,2934,4.3786764705882355

7846595,1,6303433758,"This is crazy. In every possible meaning of the word. I mean nothing about this PPV makes sense. It's the kind of movie that they would show to Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork Orange to break his mind. The King of the Road match between Dustin Rhodes & The Blacktop Bully was straight out boring. The Martial Arts Match between Meng & Jim Duggan was dumb as poo and the same goes for the boxer vs wrestler match between Arn Anderson & Johnny B.Badd. The ending of the Randy Savage-Avalanche match where a Rick Flair in DRAGS(No I'm not kidding) interferes was one of the dumbest endings I ever seen and I saw every match with Doink The Clown in them. The Sting-Big Bubba Rogers match was third rate at ""best"". The Hulk Hogan-Vader Strap match was one of the most cartoony and dumbest matches I ever laid eyes on and I especially hate the part where Hogan drags Rick Flair instead of Vader with the strap to all 4 turnbuckles and still wins. That's just STUPID!!!! The Falls Count Anywhere tag team match between The Nasty Boys & Harlem Heat was sloppy & stupid too. This make WWE's Wrestlemania 9 a good event by comparison. I give this trash-heap a 0 out of 10.",1278028800,,1160,4.425233644859813

WCW Uncensored 1995
Before the entire gimmick match based One Night Stand was created, WCW had its own PPV with nothing but gimmick matches. This was the first Uncensored PPV and it was a train wreck of horrible. This is not worth purchasing for any reason except to laugh at. All of the matches are under no disqualification rules.

King of the Road Match
Dustin Rhodes VS Blacktop Bully
This match would take place in the back 16-Wheeler. Both contestants will be in the trailer trying to reach the front of the trailer to sound a horn. Now this all sounds fairly interesting. The trailer is filled with hay bails though, and the impact of moves in nonexistent. The match was very boring and far too long. In fact, this match would end up being inducted into Wrestlecrap.
RATING- 1/10

Martial Arts Match
Hacksaw Jim Duggan VS Meng
I'm not sure why this is called a martial arts match sine Meng is the only one who knows Martial arts. The match takes a very long to get underway due to Duggan not wanting to bow to Meng. The match was practically a squash. Duggan cannot seem to hurt Meng at all. Duggan is also bad at selling and ruins any credibility this match had. Sonny Oono is the special guest referee.
RATING- 1.5/10

Boxer VS Wrestler (Match of the VHS)
Johnny B. Badd VS Arn Anderson
This is actually a fairly decent match. The match is set for ten three minute rounds. After every round there is a break. You can win by pin fall, submission, or 10-Count Knockout. Johnny dominates the first two rounds with him boxing skill. After the second round, Anderson jumps Johnny during the break. The match from there has Anderson dominating by cheating. I really liked the ending too. Not great, but a lot better then the rest of the show.
RATING- 7/10

Randy Savage VS Avalanche
Savage starts this match off with a bang by diving to the outside onto Avalanche. From there the match hits an unbearable slow pace. Avalanche dominated with Savage getting a few offensive flurries. The ending is an abomination.
RATING- 4.5/10

Sting VS Big Bubba Rogers
This match is a little better than the previous bout, but is still not that entertaining. Sting is winning the match until he hurts his leg. Big Bubba focuses on Sting's leg for the remainder of the match. The ending is weird and you really question who won the match for a few seconds.
RATING- 5.5/10

Texas Tornado Rules
Nasty Boys VS Harlem Heat
I actually expected this to be the saving grace for this PPV. I was wrong. Texas Tornado rules mean there are no tags and falls count anywhere. Harlem Heat jump the Nasty Boys from behind to start the match. Nothing much happens until they leave the ring and find themselves at a fake concession stand. You can tell it's fake because no one is buying anything and it is next to the entrance set. Drinks get spilled all over the floor and this match becomes an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/America-s-Funniest-Home-Videos/dp/B0009MAPWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">America's Funniest Home Videos</a>. The rest of the match consists of them slipping and falling with hardly any moves in between. The ending is horrible for the reason that the camera doesn't even see it when it happens.
RATING- 3/10

Strap Match
Hulk Hogan VS Vader w/ Ric Flair
Jimmy Hart, Hogan's Manager, has been missing all night. Hogan is promising a surprise. Ric Flair is dressed as a woman. This match had a lot of storyline going into it. The match itself is pretty average. Hogan's surprise is just an Ultimate Warrior knockoff named Renegade. Jimmy Hart returns in the middle of the match looking like he has been kidnapped. Ric Flair is just crazy. The strap match gets little attention with all this madness, and it just feels like too much is going on. The ending is horrible with Hogan dragging Flair to the four corners instead of Vader. Hogan still wins for some reason though. The aftermath involving masked men is pretty dumb as well.

7846598,1,6303433758,"The whole concept behind this PPV is that every match had a gimmick to it...good & unique concept that honestly was executed poorly.  Also none of the titles were on the line thoughout this PPV which made some of the matches seem like ""what was the point of that?""  This PPV turned out to be a complete embarrisment to WCW (and wrestling) at the time.

King Of The Road Match: Dustin Rhodes vs. Blacktop Bully - This match took place on the back of a caged flatbed moving truck where you had to move from the back to front & ring a bell at the top of the flatbed.  They were limited in what they could do so it wasn't anything special once you get past the whole ""they're fighting on the back of a flatbed truck"" thing.

Martial Arts Match: Jim Duggan vs. Meng - Duggan doesn't know anything about martial arts so this was really a brawler vs. martal arts match...and it just wasn't any good period.

Boxer vs. Wrestler Match: Johnny B. Badd vs. Arn Anderson - You can see why these type of matches never work because it just wasn't a good mesh.  It had a comical ending around the third round but besides that, it was like a train wreck that you had to just watch.

Randy Savage vs. Avalanche - This match was just too slow & dull and Macho Man was grounded with slow moves by Avalanche.  The only thing to note in this match was Ric Flair dressing up in drag (complete with makeup, painted fingernails, ect.) to attack Randy Savage.  It's sad what Flair was reduced to at this time.

Sting vs. Big Bubba - This was just another dull & boring match but I'll give some credit as Sting sold his hurt leg better than I've seen most wrestlers sell injuries.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Nasty Boys vs. Harlem Heat - This was the match of the night as this was the all over the arena brawl that resulted in everything being used as weapons...including mustard & funnel cakes with Sherri tripping & falling over all the mess that was made during this match.  It was just a fun wild & crazy brawl to watch.

Strap Match: Hulk Hogan vs. Vader - Due to the backstage politics surrounding this entire fued (both men refused to job cleanly to each other), this match was overbooked with various runins & angles that was completely overkill.  First, this match was the debut of the Renegade character...which was nothing more than a cheap knockoff of the Ultimate Warrior (which Eric Bischoff, V.P. of WCW, admitted in Warrior's WWE DVD).  Another story was the ""kidnapping of Jimmy Hart"" in which he came out during the match with the assumption that Flair & Vader kidnapped Hart to keep him from being in Hogan's corner.  The masked man angle that WCW did back in late '97 (who was unmasked to be Brutus Beekcake back in October) returned here as well for it be revealed that Arn Anderson was in on everything going on with Flair & Vader as well.  Due to each man not willing to do the job, the ending had Hogan tied Flair to the strap (who was still wearing the makeup on his face from the Savage attack earlier) and touched all the corners with Flair attached to win the match.  Again, this was just out of control wacky booking that killed this match.

In the end, WCW Uncensored was just a complete joke of an event that isn't even worth watching unless you just like to get a guilty pleasure out of ""wrestlecrap"" moments like this PPV.  Skip it.",1183939200,,3341,4.391233766233766
7846599,1,6303433758,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE, BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, THE WORST WRESTLING PPV OF ALL TIME! HERE'S MY THOUGHTS ON THESE BORING MATCHES;
1. KING OF THE ROAD MATCH
DUSTIN RHODES VS. BLACKTOP BULLY
AN ORIGINAL IDEA THAT'S KINDA STRANGE AND UNIQUE AT THE SAME TIME. BUT THIS MATCH IS SO BORING, YOU'LL SEE WHY THIS MATCH TYPE WAS NEVER DONE AGAIN! RATING; 0.5/5

MENG VS. HACKSAW JIM DUGGAN
BORING! NEXT MATCH. RATING; 1/5

4. RANDY SAVAGE VS. AVALANCHE
EVEN THOUGH I LIKE THE MACHO MAN, THIS MATCH SUCKED! RATING; 1/5
5. STING VS. BIG BUBBA ROGERS
YET ANOTHER BAD MATCH. HOWEVER, BIG BUBBA ROGERS, BETTER KNOWN AS THE BIG BOSSMAN IN THE WWE, ACTUALLY WON THIS MATCH. RATING; 1/5
6. TEXAS TORNADO TAG MATCH
HARLEM HEAT [BOOKER T & STEVIE RAY] VS. THE NASTY BOYS [BRIAN KNOBS & JERRY SAGS]
MORE OF THE SAME UNPLEASANTNESS THAT PLAGUED EVERY MATCH ON THIS PPV. WHY WAS NO TITLES ON THE LINE?!! RATING; 1/5
7. STRAP MATCH

The martial arts whatever with meng and HACKSAW of all people, this guy can't even wrestle!!! Don't complicate things he'll go into a coma if you do.  The Sting match with Bossman was good, actually it was teh best of the PPV.  The Nasty/Harlem wasn't to bad except for the whole suspension of disbelief theory of wrestling gets shattered to pieces and Sherri follows the action but steers clear the whole time of danger.  The Main Event...common Vader could dip Hogan and ranch dressing and eat him if he wanted to but Hogan bumps for no one and that pretty much sums up the match.
