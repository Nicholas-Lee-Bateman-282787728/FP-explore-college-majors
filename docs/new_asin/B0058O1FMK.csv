8461960,5,B0058O1FMK,"This may be the best TNA show of the year. This ppv would be the fore-runner of the One Night Only concept ppvs, and there is a lot of good stuff in this event. Plus this brings back the 6-sided ring. The first time seen since early 2010 and it wouldn't be seen until halfway through 2014.

Kazarian vs. Samoa Joe - Good opener, much better than I thought it was going to be. Does a great job setting the tone for this show.

Douglas Williams vs. Mark Haskins - While I love Williams work, Haskins keeps this match from being good

Eric Young/Shark Boy vs. Generation Me - Pretty good tag team match, and of course Eric antics makes this match just fun to watch

Ultimate X Match - The Ultimate X match never disappoints, and this one is another good example of that.

RVD vs. Jerry Lynn - This match was good to see. While I do wish they could have made this a No DQ match of some kind. So this one focuses more on their wrestling and less on hardcore moves. We'll see better matches between these two in TNA at Bound for Glory 2011 and X-Travaganza 2013 tho. But still not bad.

Austin Aries vs. Jack Evans vs. Low Ki vs. Zema Ion - There is nothing that I can say to give this match its justice. It's superb. Easily the match of the night. So many things are going on and this match lasts just long enough to keep your head from exploding.

Abyss vs. Brian Kendrick - This X-Division title match is the only title match and the only match that is in continuity with the storylines on Impact. This match focuses a lot on the ""David vs. Goliath"" mentality but with the insanity of both wrestlers it makes for a good match and the celebration afterwards give it a lot of grandeur.

AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels - This match I think fans have seen a million times, but it wouldn't be an X-Division themed ppv without having this match, and plus it's in the 6-sided ring, giving it wonderful nostalgia.

Overall fantastic show, and I very much recommend.",1404432000,,1957,4.310626702997276
8461961,4,B0058O1FMK,If you're looking for an old-school TNA PPV - this is your DVD! TNA finally brought back the ACTION we loved in the early years of NWA:TNA (2002-2004) before the pace slowed. It is highly worth the price and the only pay per view I was eager to see from them since 2005.,1388620800,,270,4.113207547169812
8461962,5,B0058O1FMK,"Every time that TNA puts on a Destination X ppv, they deliver. If you are an X-division fan, then I think this will be a good buy. The fights are very well performed, and if you like to follow some of the story-lines, this is the turning point for Austin Aries, who is now one of the premiere faces of the company. Its reasonably priced and sufficiently long. Give it a go.",1384041600,,373,4.194444444444445
8461963,5,B0058O1FMK,"The Spotlight was once again shined on the X-Divsion. It was a solid & refreashing that lived up to TNA's ""Westling Matters"" slogan. The X-Divsion Championship match between Abyss & Brain Kendrick was a classic David & Goliath battle that lived up to the story. The RVD-Jerry Lynn match was just as good as thier matches from ECW's PPV shows:Living Dangerously & Hardcore Heaven. The AJ Styles-Christopher Daniels match was just as good as thier bouts from the indie circuit. The rest were great too. I give this event a 10 out of 10.",1314489600,,534,4.691489361702128
8461964,5,B0058O1FMK,"Just like the ECW Reunion was the theme of Hardcore Justice, TNA moved their ""Destination X"" PPV to July in order for it to an event revolving around the X Division.  With that being the theme of this show, you didn't see any wrestlers (with a few exceptions) who didn't compete in the X division meaning that names such as Sting, Mr. Anderson, Kurt Angle, Jeff Jarrett, the knockouts, ect. were not on this PPV while TNA brought in X division stars from the past & present (and future) to the show as well along with bring back the six sided ring for one night only.  It should also be noted that Taz wasn't able to appear so Jeremy Borash joined Tenay on commentary & actually added heavily to the commentary with little factors & past history on various individuals & matches involved.

Samoa Joe vs. Kazarian - This match got personal after the bar fight (second one in a row Joe's been in leading up to a PPV match for those keeping track) between these two on the previous Impact so Kaz rushed Joe as soon as he got in the ring with both men exchanging chops & punches taking the fight to the floor.  Very dominate & physical was Joe with his chops to the back & kicks to the ring causing the crowd to respond with the classic ""Joe's Gonna Kill You!"" chants before Kaz was able to recover with his offense of executing various moves from springboarding off the ropes such as a dropkick & legdrop & tornado DDT.  Joe at one point executed a great suicide plancha smash to the outside while also being able to counter Kaz's attempted ""Fade To Black"" into a powerbomb to STF to crossface living up to his name of the ""Samoan Submission Machine"" causing Kaz to resort to dirty tactics.  This was a well done opening match that was very physical & continued the current storyline going on with Samoa Joe.

Douglas Williams vs. Mark Haskins - Williams issued an open challenge leading up to the PPV & it was answered by Mark Haskins who wrestled on TNA's last European tour (and made quite an impression on there according to Borash on commentary) but this was his debut in the Impact Zone & unfortunately greeted with ""Who Are You?"" chants.  Williams worked the style we are used to from him by taking it to the mat & working over the arm including executing a sideways bow & arrow before Haskins was able to flip over into a near fall attempt followed by a back & forth exchange of near falls & mat wrestling between both men.  Both men got more aggressive via exchanging headbutts & forearms & uppercuts while performing such moves like Williams ramming him into the corner while in a Gory Guerrero Special & Haskins blocking the Rolling Chaos before nailing Douglas with the Diamond Cutter/RKO.  This was a very solid match (minus a minor botch or two) that had a special mix of various international styles together that you normally don't get in just one match & Haskins definitely left a positive impression.

Eric Young & Shark Boy vs. Generation Me - This was a special bonus tag match & as you would expect from the names involved, this was an entertaining comedy match from the start about who was starting to Shark Boy taking a ""bite"" out of the competition.  There was some good action here from GenMe with the exchanges of armdrags & leg sweeps between Max & Young with Jeremey hitting a faceplant in the ring followed by a moonsault off the apron to the floor.  With Eric Young's comedy usually being a hit or miss, this was an entertaining comedy match that did have some decent action in it as well.

Ultimate X Match - Alex Shelley vs. Shannon Moore vs. Amazing Red vs. Robbie E - This was to determine the #1 contender for the X Division Championship & as pointed out on the commentary, this was the 25th Ultimate X Match in the company's history.  There was a bunch of spots & moments such as Shelley doing a double baseball slide kick into both Moore & Robbie who was hanging from the corner with Shelley later doing a dragon screw legwhip onto Red while his other leg was wrapped in the ropes, Robbie missing a slidekick & getting stuck between the apron & ring, Moore & Red pulling out double team moves from the playbooks of the Hardys along with Sabu & RVD, and Shannon Moore's dangerous way of attempting to grab the X.  This wasn't the insane stunt show that we've seen from these types of matches in the past but had it's good share of spots & bumps.

Jerry Lynn vs. Rob Van Dam - This was their first match against each other in a decade & the match we were originally scheduled to have at Hardcore Justice a year earlier as it was pointed out in the commentary before the match that RVD has never competed in an X division match but his style was, as RVD put it himself, ""X division before there was an X division"" while one of his greatest rivals in Jerry Lynn would go on to be one of the original pioneers of the X division in TNA.  There were dueling chants for both men before they even touched & with both men knowing each other so well, there were various reversals & counters against each other leading to many stalemates.  RVD wasn't his usual cocky & arrogant self as he actually showed respect to Jerry by holding the ropes for him to get back in the ring & even offered a handshake but Lynn refused it & threw RVD over the top rope followed by a somersault off the apron onto RVD on the floor & showed an aggressive side by resorting to hair pulling & choking RVD on the ropes.  RVD was able to recover before both men starting reliving signature moments from their past encounters such RVD's spinning legdrop off the apron onto Lynn who was draped on the outside guardrail while Lynn later brought in a chair that resulted in the classic sequence involved an attempted Van Daminator & leg sweep resulting in a legdrop onto the chair that caused RVD to bleed from the top of his eye.  Lynn brought another chair into the ring but Van Dam nailed him and went for a monkey flip on the chair but Lynn evaded it and used a sunset flip to send RVD sailing across the ring with the back of RVD's head landing on the chair.  This was a great fantastic competitive match that definately had a lot of moments for those who remember their series in ECW over a decade ago.

Low Ki vs. Austin Aries vs. Zema Ion vs. Jack Evans - This match was to determine who would get a contract with the promotion with the theme of two wrestlers from TNA's past against two new faces.  The audience went crazy for all four men & started chanting ""everybody"" instead of picking one guy over another.  This match was all four men in the ring at the same time leading to a bunch of (no pun intended) total non-stop action with various moments like Aries racking everyone's back leading to him on the receiving end of a three way sandwich dropkick, a pretty series of moves by Jack Evans where did a dropkick to Ki then kick to Ion knocking him down followed by another dropkick to Ki bouncing off him into a backflip pin on Ion, Aries & Ki's face off with both rookies trying to take advantage of it & ended up paying for it in dual submission holds, how Jack Evans broke up Ki's pin on Aries, Aries going for a high speed dive that resulted in a kick from Ki that looked like it killed him, and how Ki went from attempting the Warrior's Way to the receiving end of a springboard frankensteiner.  I can try to summarize this match but fans chants throughout the match say it best, ""SIGN THEM ALL!...THIS IS AWESOME!...THIS IS WRESTLING!...THANK YOU ALL!""

TNA X Division Champion Abyss vs. Brian Kendrick - For those who don't know the storyline, Abyss is Immortal's hired gun sent to destroy the X division & was already in possession of the X Division Championship that he renamed as his ""Xtreme Title"".  This was truly a ""David vs. Goliath"" setup so Kendrick tried to go straight up against Abyss only for nothing to effect him & Kendrick even bounced off him when attempting a crossbody block.  Kendrick then switched to trying to ""hit & run"" but kept getting caught & beaten down by Abyss resorting to him resorting to biting Abyss' fingers to escape a chokeslam.  Abyss was very dominate but kept getting distracted by going to his ""Art Of War"" book for spiritual motivation allowing Kendrick to recover & bust him open with a right hand.  Kendrick built momentum by dropkicking Abyss out of the ring while executing aerial offense from a suicide dive out to the floor along with a missile dropkick on Abyss in the ring before Abyss finally caught Kendrick with the referee getting knocked out with Kendrick finally able hit his Slice Bread onto Abyss.  From here, members of Immortal appeared (including Bischoff who payed for it) got involved before members of the X division came out to ensure Kendrick had a fair chance to win back the title for the entire division.  As I stated earlier, this was a ""David vs. Goliath"" match but was still a good match considering the setup but this was more about putting over the storyline of the X division wrestlers taking back & defending their division more than anything else.

A.J. Styles vs. Christopher Daniels - Throughout the night, highlights of Styles & Daniels history was shown to document the history of both men & how personal their relationship is with even Borash pointing out on commentary how both men had one of their children named after the other.  Both men grounded each other early with Styles heavily working over the arm with moves like a hammerlock & armbar while going back to the arm whenever he got the advantage after an exchange of moves.  The match was taken to the outside various times with Daniels executing two back to back suicide dives (including getting a headbutt on the second one) onto A.J. while Styles later did a dive over the top rope onto Daniels back on the outside before going back into the ring & went for an armbar submission.  They battled on the apron with A.J. being able to hit a back suplex onto the apron before A.J. attempted a springboard that resulted in him having his neck snap back from the top rope leaving the opening for Daniels to focus on Styles' neck with a clutch submission & Styles attempted another springboard later on but just ""crashed & burned"" only to recover & catch Daniels on the top rope & executing a powerbomb from the Torture Rack back breaker position.  The intensity really picked up towards the end with both men getting their knees up for various high risk moves & kicking out of each others signature moves causing both men to pull out something from their moveset that's design to be more impactful than we've seen before or something we haven't seen in a long time.  This was a very physical match that started off slow & built over time with both men doing great storytelling & working by both men.

In the end, this was the best overall PPV from TNA/Impact Wrestling I've seen in a very long time as every match was quality in it's own right & this is a PPV that's worth going out of your way to see from.",1311033600,4,10961,4.463731865932966

Matches are out of 5 stars:

1. Kaz vs Samoa Joe: Match was good to very good, good way to start the show, Joe actually worked well with Kaz, Kaz hit a bunch of nice high flying moves, Joe hitting some power moves, match went at a good pace, I liked it, I didn't agree with Kaz winning but oh well, match was still good,
Rating: ***1/4

2. Doug Williams vs Mark Haskins: Ok match to be honest, Mark Haskins came to TNA to actually wrestle, he did include some botches though, but the match was fine,
Rating: **1/2

3. Generation Me vs SharkBoy/Eric Young: I do think that Sharkboys gimmick is pretty funny but as a wrestler he sucks, the match was ok with gen me hitting there spots but why the hell did gen me lose, seriously, why did Eric Young and Sharkboy have to win so much,
Rating: **1/2

4. Alex Shelly vs Robbie E vs Shannon Moore vs Amazing Red Ultimate X Match: This was one of the worst ultimate x matches I have ever seen but as a match it was still pretty damn good, Red was the star of the match doing some amazing dives, in my opinion Generation Me should of been in this match instead of Moore and Robbie E, glad to see Alex Shelly win though,
Rating: ***1/4

5. RVD vs Jerry Lynn: This is a very old school style match, I still really like it, this match shows that these two men are past there prime but they proved that they can still wrestle, a very good wrestling match, the last 5 mins a steel chair was involved, bringing back memories of the old ECW days, there was a nasty bit where RVD got powerbombed onto the chair and it look sick, I loved the match, a lot better than I tought it would be,
Rating: ***1/2

6. Austin Aries vs Zema Ion vs Low Ki vs Jack Evans, Winner gets a TNA contract: Ok, this match is what I was looking foward to, I mean Evans, Aries and Low Ki in the same match, I kenw this was going to be awesome, and it definatley was, this was just great, a 13 minute crazy ass match, with these 4 guys flying all over the place, Low Ki was my favourite in this match but I was cheering on Austin Aries, I was so happy when he won because he deserves another chance in TNA, this was my favourite match of the show,
Rating: ****

7. Abyss(c) vs Brian Kendrik X Division Title: This was fine, I thought it was going to be worse, the ending was a good monet with Kendrik winning the title but that was the only memorable moment of the match,
Rating: **

8. Aj Styles vs Christopher Daniels: This wasn't the best match these two have had with eachother but it was still great, the match was 28 minutes long so they got enough time to showcase there wrestling abilities, the start was a bit boring, and then it picked up towards the middle, some nice spots by both guys, some nice near falls at the end, and the end was excellent with Styles hitting the spiral tap, I just love that move, this was my 2nd favourite match of the night,
Rating: ****

PPV Overall: 8.25/10

Comments: I reccomend this show as this has been the only good ppv put on by tna, so if you want to see TNA at its best, I think you should by this DVD",1310947200,,3074,4.1237458193979935
