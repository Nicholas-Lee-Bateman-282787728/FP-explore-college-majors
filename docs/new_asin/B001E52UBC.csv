8296418,5,B001E52UBC,"""Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge, the man you love to hate but cannot miss,...whose essence of achievement always lay in his command over words."" This video has brought yet another refreshing perspective from the rather 'superannuated' journalist/author/apologist, though his name will eventually be forgotten and dismissed, his views are without a doubt, eternal. This is because I think he saw the Kingdom of Christ/City of God as being the ultimate pursuit of Man, and not a 'Heaven on Earth' scenario in which he saw, being  beguiled by his Marxist Utopian Dreams where he though it was the ruling of the proletariat that was of supreme importance but instead he saw the horror of the Stalinist era along with the Bolshevik Revolution that completely shattered his vision. This video is my most favorite, although I enjoy seeing Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge in other videos, but this video in particular he addresses the church, the arts, faith, happiness, absurdity of Man, and the hope that comes with Christianity. As a floundering Christian, being assailed with doubts and apprehensions about my faith, life, and purpose, I have found Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge as being an anchor in his perspective and experience as a Christian pilgrim. If you were to read his journals and autobiographies, he dealt extensively with the pain, apathy, disillusionment, etc. that we inevitably encounter in life, and it is only in the latter part of his life that he found that glimmering light that Christ ineffably shines to those who are willing. And so, I am a fan of Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge, though in the midst of the vicissitudes of our mercurial culture and livelihood, it is quite refreshing to hear, see, and read someone like Mr. Malcolm Muggeidge who lived such a life that his experiences proved to be sympathetic with our own lives, our own inadequacy, and our own desperate need for a Savior. I love this video, and I highly recommend it to those who are questioning the legitimacy of Christianity, such as I at one point in my journey, but I hope this brings reassurance to those who may be in doubt.",1444435200,,2088,4.931818181818182

8296421,5,B001E52UBC,"Malcom Muggeridge was of course a frequent guest on firing line throughout it's thirty plus years on the air. The review of questions put to Mr Muggeridge by Mr Buckley revealed a religious earnestness seldom in evidence even, and most especially perhaps among theologians. Muggeridge has an outlook very similar to Fr Ronald Knox just prior to and after his conversion to the Catholic faith. Muggeridge of course never converted to the Catholic faith, preferring instead to remain in the Anglican church. Nevertheless he held pretty much the same essential doctrinal positions that traditional Catholicism has always held and continues to do so today.
He gives interesting reasons for not entering into full communion with the Catholic church, which by the way aren't too different from those held by organizations like the Pius X society. He held to the position that the Catholic church since Vatican II had moved away from it's doctrinal standards that once characterized the Catholic church prior to this council. As a consequence Muggeridge felt it would be rather dishonest of him if he converted since his differences with Vatican II were rather insurmountable.

As is usual with a discussion between Muggeridge and Buckley, one is left with a completely satisfactory intellectual assessment of the issues under discussion. I highly recommend this episode to anyone struggling with the idea of the traditional verses the modern in Catholic affairs, especially if one is considering converting to the Catholic faith.",1361836800,2,1523,5.293388429752066

I enjoyed Buckley through the years.  As a result of his conversations w/Muggeridge, I have read several of Malcolm's books.
