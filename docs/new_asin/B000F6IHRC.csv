8117927,5,B000F6IHRC,This was a gift and the recipient was thrilled.  What an uplifting story.  Sergio's spirit will inspire us and will be with us forever.  Angels do exist.,1380412800,,153,4.592592592592593
8117928,4,B000F6IHRC,"A must see portrait of a diplomat who was a caring human being first.

De Mello's work in conflict resolution shows his deep emotional commitment

in the process for genuine peace, not just an effort to make the U.N.look good.

  A great introduction to the many conflicts this man was working on

around the world.

  Also a bleak reminder of how little progress has been made in Iraq.

This film provides a great education into the workings and conflicts the U.N.

8117929,5,B000F6IHRC,"This documentary combines a fine objective balance between the realistic frustrations in political diplomacy and the optimistic humanism of a caring peacemaker. Very inspiring, it gives a closer look at the personal dimension in  trying to resolve global conflicts.",1173052800,,265,5.794871794871795
8117930,5,B000F6IHRC,"Simone Duarte's presentation on the Srgio Vieira de Melo's career, besides being a well-deserved tribute, is, no doubt, a powerful mirror of what a diplomat should be, i.e. someone who doesn't distinguish between the nature of international affairs and the other areas of policy. She manages to demonstrate that he was, in his essence, a caring man, a gleaming example on the field, with a full understanding of the local politics, rather than what most diplomats project through their self-serving elitism, egotism and separatism towards the outside world.

When and where no one seemed to mind, he minded; when and where no one was accountable for, he was.",1172620800,2,658,5.092592592592593
8117931,5,B000F6IHRC,"A must see movie for people who want to understand the importance of true diplomacy in this conflict ridden world.

This moving film follows the life of the amazing Brazilian diplomat Sergio Viera De Mello. Many people do not know much about this charasmatic leader whose charm, intelligence and commitment changed the lives of people in Mozambique, East Timor, Iraq and beyond. My eyes welled up when I heard diplomats, family and friends talk about how Sergio's extraordinary diplomatic skills allowed him to resolve conflict with some of the most brutal dictators in the world, in order to provide for better lives for the countries citizens.

With the current state of global affairs and the lack of dialogue occuring, losing this great diplomat who was slated to become the next secretary general of the UN is a great loss for all of us and makes us think about how things could be different if more people like Sergio were engaged in true diplomacy.",1172361600,,955,4.852760736196319
8117932,5,B000F6IHRC,"It really seems to be a challenge to make a watchable documentary. In En Route to Baghdad, Simone Duarte has proven she is up for the task. Not only is the movie cleverly made, it is also fun to watch. I strongly recommend it and for a wide public: those interested in international relations and the Middle East, in particular, and also those who enjoy cunning documentaries. This is state-of-the-art journalism, presented in an entertaining, yet clever manner!",1170115200,,462,4.935897435897436
8117933,5,B000F6IHRC,"This is a wonderful film not just about the diplomatic process, but about one of the world's most important diplomats. We live in time where we all need more understanding, more vision and more honesty. This film is about a man with those qualities. De Mello served as an inspiration for so many and gave us hope that peace was possible. His violent and unnecessary death makes his message more pressing than ever. We should all heed his advice and look for global understanding and connections rather than reasons to isolate ourselves in this complicated world. Bravo to the filmmaker for looking closely and deeply at an important icon that we should all know about. Watch this film, perhaps there is another De Mello to be inspired.",1167609600,7,735,4.7952755905511815
