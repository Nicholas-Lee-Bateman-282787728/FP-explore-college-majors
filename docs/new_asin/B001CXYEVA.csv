3520480,1,B001CXYEVA,"These movies look truly astounding,  assuming you can get them to play on your Blu-ray player.  Many hang on black screens, others get stuck in the menu, some don;t even make it that far.

Its not just Sony players, there are irate threads about these 6 bond Blu-ray discs all over the net and the same exact problems are happening on a whole slew of players (Sony's, LG's, Samsungs, Panasonics), even with the most recent firmware updates.  It's most likely the discs themselves that are at fault but does it really matter whose fault it is?

The end result is a big fat black eye for Blu-ray.  The Blu-ray Disc Association, the hardware manufacturers, and the content producers need to get their act together.",1224720000,45,711,4.693548387096774
3520481,1,B001CXYEVA,These discs do not work on my Samsung Blu-Ray player. Not sure if it is all Samsungs. I updated the firmware and they still do not play. I didn't buy these but got them through netflix so at least I'm not out for the full price.,1224633600,22,228,3.9782608695652173
3520482,3,B001CXYEVA,"I will skip the content reviews as we all know what is to be seen, that just leaves how it looks and sounds. The quality of the Blu transfers are very well done, the colors, content lines, and saturations all were transcribed eloquently. There were no blurs, no grain, no artifcats - all in all a pleasure to watch all these years later.

The sound was brought across ok (and I love anything DTS), but the limitations of the time seem to filter through in a variety of scenes. The music overwhelms some scenes and the mix was obviously dubbed wrong at certain moments but that once again was original mixing issues.

The special features are endless and can give any Bond fan hours of enjoyment that have not been on other sets before. The menu navigation was actually flawless and can be up to 7 selections deep with some of the special features.

The detractor though - an incredible list of flubs on the case. They used a cheap cardboard book sleeved in a flimsy plastic/glued outer paper...with - prepare yourself - moronic chair leg fobs glued to the cardboard pages to hold each disc. That designer needs to be FIRED. Each of my customers' sets (including mine for the store) had loose discs. Each set has lasted only one to two uses before the remaining glued fobs just fall apart or stay attached to the disc. Essentially - the cases are totally useless; I would highly recommend using your own storage system.

Overall - the movies look great but the packaging is a laundry list of problems, I went to the local Costco and listened to all 40 sets they had on the floor and each one had loose discs (mind you I gently listened). The quality of the pics have impressed customers to where they are even noticing the vibrant color of the actor's eyes; but also one little problem came up I was not expecting - nudity. The clarity is so crisp that you notice a naked breast before the pool scene that could not be seen before and in the bedroom scene with the blonde girl...a customer complained because they noticed it as I was playing it in the store. Oh well...",1224633600,10,2068,4.477453580901857
3520483,3,B001CXYEVA,"As stated in another post, these discs do not seem to play at all on some stand alone Blu-ray players even with the latest updates. Maybe future firmware will fix this. Fortunately I have a PS3 and they seem to play just fine on it. Honestly I don't know why I bother with the stand alone unit as the PS3 loads and handles the java soo much better.

On the actual disc quality, they offer clean, clear video and great sound! The Blu-Ray version is a big improvement over the standard DVD version. If you have a PS3 to watch them with I highly recommend.",1224633600,6,553,4.266666666666667
3520484,1,B001CXYEVA,"I bought all six of these separately, but not even ONE would play on my Blu-ray player.  I have over a hundred Blu-ray discs in my collection so it's not my player's fault.  I even followed the suggestion inside each box and went to the web page for the suggested upgrade for my player, just in case.  My Blu-ray version was higher than the online download version.  These discs are junk and will have to be returned.  I'm concerned that even exchanged copies will not play on my player.  There's something wrong with this batch (and probably with others, too).

You really get your moneys worth with the quality of the rendition, or transfer over to High Definition Blu-ray. It was renditioned by James Bond fans you'd have to think if you seen it before on DVD, TV etc. It wasn't that clear in the movie theater in the 60's. So if you got a big screen, buy it.

The quality is great - much clearer and much better sound than older regular DVD`s. More special  features also.

Only problem is that with a Sony Playstation (plays blue rays) there are no bookmarks or resume features..
If it is turned off during  a sequence, you are automatically started at the movies beginning screen each time and must fast forward or use scence selection to resume.

In ""From Russia with Love"",J.Bond takes his shoes off by a desk and goes into the bathroom,seconds later he goes back into the room which now DOES NOT HAVE A DESK OR HIS SHOES.Too bad Sean Connery is still bitter about his Bond days that he will not make any commentaries for his Bond Films.

3520509,5,B001CXYEVA,"The James Bond films in the Blu-ray, in word: FANTASTIC.

We compared the old 1962 Dr. No to the new blu-ray DR. No and all anybody in our household could say was: WOW!

I purchased 3, 3 packs - 9 different movies in all and they are all great.

The movie comes alive, we have a 1080p, 52"" screen with a 5.1 surround system.

The packaging was great and I received the package (3 dvds in one package) was great. Each movie is set in its own case with all three set in one very nice sturdy case.

If you're a James Bond fan, then get these blu-ray upgrades: they're well worth it.",1308614400,,579,4.088495575221239
3520510,4,B001CXYEVA,"Yet another MGM Blu-Ray three pack, this collection is almost worth buying separately...

For you get the first- and one of the best 007 adventures 'Dr No'- and also Roger Moore's first and best outing, 'Live and Let Die'. Unfortunately Pierce Brosnan's last film, 'Die Another Day' comes with it.

Well, as MeatLoaf once sang, 'Two out of three ain't bad'.

'Dr No' is a terrific transfer; despite it's low budget the restoration, lovingly done, is pitch perfect. Not much in the way of supplemental, though. Moore's opus 'Live and Let Die' is also superbly restored, it is also one of the most entertaining films in the series. Poor Pierce Brosnan; history will not be kind to most- if not all of his efforts.

Not his fault; he hands in a solid performance done in by Halle Berry's godawful one and some really silly effects shots. But it is cringeworthy in more than one instance, and it underscores just how much the series improved with the Dan Craig efforts.

But seeing that all of the adventures are NOT available- yet- in Hi-Def, then it makes the lesser efforts still marginally worth owning...",1304985600,,1105,4.734375
3520511,5,B001CXYEVA,"Unless you have lived a cloistered existence you are undoubtedly aware of the three 007 adventures contained within this set, so we'll just give a primer...

Starting with 1963's 'From Russia With Love', easily one of Connery's best outings. Excellent restoration and Hi-Def transfer; so good it shows the budgetary limitations of the original product. Later films fare somewhat better at this; such is the case with 1965's 'Thunderball', a personal favorite.

The superior production values and photography come out in this stellar Blu Ray, a 'must' own for any collection. Much is made of the film's shortcomings- but in the end this IS the 'big budget Bond blockbuster'
that has spawned countless imitations and still holds up well; the Bahama locations literally jump off the screen.

Which brings us to 1981's 'For Your Eyes Only', Roger Moore's fifth outing, and a 'return to earth' after the effects laden 'Moonraker'. This film serves as an interesting companion piece to 'From Russia With Love' for it tries- mightily- to tap the same vein. While nowhere near as good, it still has it's pleasures and is great to look at as well.

All told, a nice package for fans and the casual observer as well...",1304985600,,1208,4.935960591133005

3520518,4,B001CXYEVA,"I wouldn't normally waste time reviewing such old movies because everyone has already seen these films. I just want to comment on the restoration process for those who already own the DVDs or VHS (if anyone still has those). In a word, the restoration of the older films is, INCREDIBLE. I only bought Vol-1 just to check it out and I'm now a believer. I put Vol-2 and 3 on my Christmas list and hope my wife gets them while they're on sale for under $25! The reason I only gave it a 4-star rating is because the newer films really haven't changed and we're forced to rebuy them in these volumes. I wish they would have released them in the order the films were released but from a marketing standpoint I understand why they didn't. On the bright side, if you buy these on sale, I think the older films alone are worth the asking price and the others are like bonuses to help build the BD library. Don't forget to watch the extra about how they restored the films, it's very interesting and will give you a greater appreciation for their hard work.",1291248000,,1047,4.374358974358974
3520519,3,B001CXYEVA,"I picked up Vol Two today.  I could tell a disc was loose, but decided to buy it and go for a refund if the disc was scratched and would not play.

The disc that was loose and floundering in the packaging was ""For Your Eyes Only"", which - like ""From Russia With Love"" is a classic.  Unlike ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Thunderball"", the foam dot used to keep the disc sturdy in the packaging wasn't present, so how it got beyond Quality Control (which is too expensive for companies nowadays, it seems).  Especially the effort put into restoring these movies' color and fidelity, it makes ZERO sense to use such poor case designs.

Thankfully, Blu-Ray discs are coated to reduce the risk OF scratching and all three discs looked scratch-free, and the movie itself played, but if the extras contain any playback problems then I will seek an exchange or refund.

And it could be worse:  If consumers stopped spending, maybe QC will come back and we can feel more confident in products we buy.  We work long and hard for the money...  then again, companies might go out of business too, lay off more workers, and see a never-ending recursive spiral...",1288483200,,1148,4.588235294117647

3520525,4,B001CXYEVA,"Here we are, yet again, with another one of these James Bond multi-disc boxed sets that MGM/UA/Fox/your grandmother seem to love re-re-re-releasing every five years or so. As usual, the movies are apparently chosen at random with little-to-no rhyme or reason given to the selections, but if you're going to buy only one of the three current Blu-Ray sets, then The James Bond Collection, Vol. 2 is the one to get.

This set contains three of the very best classic Bond films: ""From Russia With Love"", ""Thunderball"" and ""For Your Eyes Only."" Each of these is among the most highly-rated among Bond fans and each stands alone as some of the most well-written, tightly paced and serious films in the EON canon.

The hi-def mastering on these Blu-Rays is, frankly, outstanding -- particularly in regards to the older films, ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Thunderball.""  While the recent Ultimate Edition DVDs represented the pinnacle of what could be achieved with standard definition mastering (and they do upscale very well in Blu-Ray/upscaling DVD players), these new discs showcase Lowry Digital's fine work in restoring these films to a hitherto unparalleled level of quality, allowing them to stand up to more recent releases like ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace."" If you're a hardcore Bond fan, you'll want at least one example demonstrating the full range of Lowry's efforts in this regard. With this box you'll own three of their best.

The packaging looks great but is, of course, rather flimsy for something so expensive. Also, no ""Goldfinger"" or ""Dr. No"" -- would it kill Fox/MGM to include four films in these things?!

3520527,4,B001CXYEVA,"I purchased this for my dad for father's day. After my dad opened the package he was really happy as he is a huge James Bond fan. We've watched all three movies in the set together (I'm also a huge 007 fan) and they are all of very high quality. The picture quality is just like all the new movies that are filmed with digital hd cameras. It really is fantastic. Whatever re-mastering techniques the studios use on older films is getting to be very good. The sound quality is also very good. My dad has a Sony 1080p TV with a PS3 for the blu-ray player, and a Klipsch 2.1 speaker system (two towers and a sub). The overall viewing experience was great.

Inside each disk case is a note saying that these movies may not be compatible with every blu-ray player, so if you bought your blu-ray player when they first came out this is definitely something to look into. There wasn't a list or anything provided of the ones that didn't work, but as long as you're not an early adopter with one of the very first blu-ray players I'm sure you will be fine. It worked fine on my dad's PS3.

My only criticism is the cardboard box could be a bit sturdier. Also, the disk cases seem to be made of thinner plastic than my other movie cases. It's definitely not poor quality, but it could be a bit heavier duty as I'm sure it will see frequent use!",1278892800,,1335,4.251968503937008

I grew up with Sean Connery so he has become my all time favorite.  I'm surprised they haven't relased them in order of their release but I guess this makes more sense.

I just tried two of the three movies on two different Blu-ray players in my house that play every Blu-ray I throw at them, except for the two Bond movies from this collection. One is a high-end Panasonic and the other a PS3. The PS3 at least got to the menu. But when I selected ""Mission"" to start the movie, the PS3 tried to play the movie but returned to the top-level menu. I then installed the latest update on the PS3 (V. 3.01) that was just released and now the two movies play.  It seems it takes the latest firmware update to ensure that ALL (some do play, others don't) will play in a PS3 player.  I don't know if once I update the Panasonic the movie will play.  Clearly there is an encoding error.  It takes smart enough firmware to decode the faultily encoded discs.

I do have one small beef also with the packaging. I like the book format inside, and the design of the aperture box, but the use of foam centers to hold the discs seems a bit lame, and I wonder how long it will be before these centers pull off.

The good news is that the films look simply amazing; they have been restored with tremendous care and loaded down with extras. The bad news is that it's such a random collection of Bond movies that don't really belong together. All you do is frustrate fans.

One of the commentaries in the special features refered to the re-masters like ""watching a movie set in the 60's, not made in the 60's"" and it is so true.

3520556,4,B001CXYEVA,"I keep buying these sets because they are cheaper than buying them seperately.  I am waiting on the other to come out.

This set continues the marketing strategy of mixing the worst with the best.  The Bronsnan films are the worst, but Goldeneye and Die Another Day were pretty good.  Tomorrow Never Dies was not good.  However, The World is Not Enough was not bad as well.  It is Brosnan's 2nd best film after Golden Eye.  I had not even seen this film since I bought the first DVD release years ago (99'?).

TWINE was a good film and for a film that is ten years old, it looks MORE high tech than the Craig Bond films.  It is VERY hight tech looking with clean CGI and even flat screen monitors!  Quality wise, this BD continues the strange tradition of the Brosnan films having either a lot of grain or a bad transfer.  TWINE was far better than Day Another Day in every way.  The picture was a lot clearer and the sound utilized well.  So far, the best Brosnan BD.

Goldfinger continues the tradition of the Connery films looking like they were filmed yesterday!  I do not know why these are the best looking of the Bond BD's, but the picture is so good looking, I kept forgetting that this was the mid-1960's.  It gives those of us who were not around during this time to get an idea how it was to live in another dimension of time.

Moonraker was reviewed all over the net as being  an astounding transfer, but I have to disagree.  This one has much edge enhancement which kind of gives it a sharpened upconverted look of the DVD.  It also shows the Moore was looking pretty old long before A View to a Kill (which is not a bad film).  All of Moore's other fims on BD look pretty good, but this one is missing a great transfer.  It could be the source.  Still something to get.",1239753600,,1783,4.272455089820359

3520558,5,B001CXYEVA,"I hope that everyone who had problems playing the first 2 Bond collections had them addressed by now because Volume 3's layout and features is consistent with the previous two. All players that received firmware upgrades after October 2008 should be able to play this set.

Here is my evaluation of the current Bond Blu-ray collection (a work in progress as I'm not fully done with the viewing) - and it's not unlike my impression of the first 2.

_____________________________________________
THE GOOD:
- Incredible video quality, most likely better than what the audience saw on release date on some of the older movies.
- Lots of extras, most of them worth watching or listening to.
- Beautiful, innovative packaging.

THE NOT SO GOOD:
- The sound restoration not as good as the video on the early Bonds.
- Some of the 'extras' sections would benefit from a 'play all' option.
- The boxes could be a bit slimmer.
- May require upgrades on certain players if they haven't been upgraded since September-October 2008.
_____________________________________________

The overall impression is of quality, inside and out. The box could be a little smaller but the packaging is exquisite. There's a transparent plastic slide cover over a solid cardboard box holding a small binder on which the individual movie disks are attached to pages. Each movie comes on one disc holding the movie itself and in incredible amount of extras.

The menu interface is well organized and there's even some humor in labeling. For example, the option that plays the movie is labeled 'The Mission' while the historic promotional material is found under 'The Propaganda'. Depending on which section you may be, menu options branch into further sub-menus.

The extras are numerous and, for the most part interesting. There are features on the restoration process and we get to learn who did what, why and how. Then, we see contemporary documentaries on the making of the movie and so on. The Goldfinger disc, for example, includes actual radio interviews with Sean Connery, 2 major documentaries on 'the making of' and 'the world of' Goldfinger, about 30 minutes each, original trailers, screen tests, an interview with Honor Blackman (Pussy Galore), even a feature on Bond's Aston Martin. And, amazingly, it all fits on one disc.

The area where some of the older installments show their age is the sound. The audio options include the original sound track which, in the older releases is 'mono' but all movies come with DTS-HD Master Audio 24-bit 5.1 surround as the default. The sound wasn't upgraded and improved to the degree that the picture was but, it's understandable. Going from mono to 5.1 surround is the equivalent of upgrading from black and white to full-color 3-D in the world of images. Commentary sound tracks featuring the director and the cast and crew are also included.

When it comes to the video quality, the best that I can say is that you've got to see it to believe it. The restoration of the older movies started with the actual original negative, which is the one reference copy that's almost never touched. Once the copy was digitized as a 4000 lines resolution digital copy (Bluray is 1080) every frame was reprocessed to eliminate any possible defects from 'dirty optics', such as the proverbial hair that we sometimes see on the older movies to scratches, bad exposure, color brilliance. The restorers' goal for the end result, and this concerns the video only, not the sound quality, was to deliver what would appear to be a contemporary movie with a 60's or 70's theme rather than a 60's or 70's movies. In my view, they succeeded and, surprisingly, the 1964 Goldfinger looks as good as the 1979 Moonraker.

My overall rating is a solid five-stars. Just about everything in this release is superlative: the physical packaging, the interface design, the extras, the video quality. The sound is not so good on the older movies but, given the state of sound restoration technologies, I did not feel compelled to remove a star because the old movies sounded more or less like they did on release date or better.",1237852800,32,4117,4.920749279538905

3520560,5,B001CXYEVA,"I too had a problem playing the bond blu-ray discs on my blu-ray player (I own the Samsung BD-P1500).  I rented From Russia With Love from netflix; I too was skeptical as to how much better the blu-rays would look compared with the Ultimate Edition dvds (all I which I had previously purchased).  The initial problem was that the player kept getting stuck on the main menu; no matter what you would select, it would always take you right back to it.  However, after downloading and loading a firmware update, the disc played perfectly.  And I am happy to report that I was more than impressed with the quality.  I thought the Ultimate Edition dvds were amazing, but the blu-rays have raised the bar for all blu-ray releases, as far as I am concerned.  After being disappointed with the lackluster quality of such high profile releases such as The Godfather, or the Blade Runner Final Cut, (still great but not much greater than the dvd release, which in itself seemed light years ahead of the previous effort on dvd) I couldn't be more pleased.  Night scenes are not the least bit grey or hazy; crisp blacks all around, and the colors just pop! I haven't seen such detail in the faces of the actors since The Dark Knight blu-ray.

3520562,3,B001CXYEVA,"I noted this in a review for Vol 2.  I keep seeing people either fawning over the packaging, or complaining about pooer quality.

Yes they have slip covers.  Plastic slip covers.  OK...

Yes they have faux-leather booklets.  Very little cover art or information within, and the discs are held in with pieces of foam that are glued to the packaging.

There are several accounts of these foam plugs either breaking/disintegrating or becoming unglued.

In my case, I opened the first Volume and 2 disks fell to the floor.

The actual movies themselves are incredible and very enjoyable.  But the packaging is really cheap.  I'd give this collection a 5/5 but not with packaging that lets discs fall out when you first open it up and leaves these beautiful movies loose in sub-par packaging.",1233360000,2,787,4.842105263157895
3520563,3,B001CXYEVA,"I agree wholeheartedly with the poor marks for packaging.  It's odd really, they probably spent an incredible amount of money on the clean up and archiving to HD, yet the packaging is the cheapest I've ever seen for movies.  Those foam tabs are really the worst - half of them were broken or came unglued.  When I opened up the first volume, two disks just fell to the floor.  Quality.  Not to mention that the package detail on the inside covers is minimal.  They might as well have saved an extra dollar on packaging and just put them in shrink-wrapped jewel cases.

The one saving grace here for you readers who are considering buying these volumes, is that the price on Amazon is way lower than buying at stores.  Had I not made an impulse buy and got these for $45 instead of $75, I'd feel better.  Then again, I did use gift cards. ;-P

Otherwise, the actual movies are incredible... the clean up really brings the older Bond films to life and the color and detail really pop.  On my 46"" 1080p they look fantastic!  Audio is of course likewise excellent.  commentary and extras are pretty informative as well.

Packaging drops this from a 5 to 4 star rating IMO.  All in all though, the movies are the product and they are excellent.",1233360000,13,1239,4.46875

With a movie that nearly parallels that of it's novel origins ( all but the killing of Dr. NO and the big octopus) and with a hell of a movie score at the time and to top it off the great acting of Sean connery and wonderful direction of Terence young (the longest Day). watching these old but good bond films in High Defintion is nothing but a new expeirence and for a bond fan like myself it's just as enjoyable as watching them like they were like in movie theater that day that they were released on. The second movie From russia with love which is probably the most recognizable of the connery bond films which had tap dancing Lotte Lenya( with a poisinous blade coming out the front of her shoe and as one of the main villains in the film who had quite the character along with Robert Shaw who had starred in most world war 2 flicks of the time. from russia with love is one colorful movie as well. then of course Goldfinger is Skipped here seeing as though this was a pretty random set of bond movies to be released at once. Thunderball is the 3rd bond movie in this blu-ray set. which brings the connery films of this set to an end which is okay for now. Because thunderball is also considered one of the better bond movies of the series. with a great cast which includes Adolfo celi, Claudine Auger,Luciana Paluzzi, Rik Van Nutter and the regular cast Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell,and Desmond Llewelyn as Q. Thunderball was another bond success. Then included included in this wonderful box set which is complete with an outer plastic slipcover to hold the nice litter disc booklet which holds 3 movies a box. is Live and Let Die, Roger Moore's first bond film which led  to a whopping seven more films(in which moore was bond). Live and let die which re-introduced bond as a more laid back witty bond. and made paul Mcartney a legend after his initial success with the beatles. and also was the first film Jane Seymour ever appeard in. and was the first bond movie to not have SPECTRE in it's plot line. Although in the opening scene of Four your Eyes only(which is probably moore's best bond film is also included in this set) we finally see Blofeld meet his demise. (bond drops him off the helicopter into a smoke stack , big chimney whatever, however in the books Blofeld met his demise in You Only Live Twice). Finally the last movie to be included in this six movie set is the Infamous Die Another Day the last of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films. is actually better than most fans give it credit for. No doubt the movie is a little corny but thats what you get when you hire Lee Tamahori as your director need i further explain this. Die another Day which was the 20th bond film which Launched Rosmund pike's career as well as Will yun lee's and Rick Yune who has had a lot of television appearances since this movie.

Given the age of the films and the way they were originally filmed, this collection has Bond looking as good as ever.

What disappoints, however, is the poor craft that went into the box design and execution.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is terrible.  The discs are literally held to the case by some spongy adhesive which seemed to have already begun to loosen itself in my gold box.  Additionally, the middle of the three discs in both packages were free to slide around in the case.  Certainly, this packaging is unfit for a man who knows his vintage of sherry...  Truly, I was shaken, not stirred.

Still, I give this set 4 stars because 1) the price point is excellent at $80.00 for six Bond films, 2) the quality of the video transfer is as good as available, and 3) it's BOND!

It seems most people that rated this movie poorly was because they had issues with their blu-ray player.  They bought a player became out of date and had poor support.  That is unless it has to do with the firmware needing a patch to work with the coding on these specific disks.

Foam spindles holding the discs in? Really? It is unbelievable that people make money to think this stuff up. The first time you take a disc out, you'll likely rip the foam right off (if the foam hasn't been ripped off in shipping already, and the disc is floating around free in the package). Solution: superglue the ripped foam back to the cardboard; just make sure you let the stuff dry before you put the disc back in.

The quality of the older bond movies is amazing on blu-ray, so on that note they did a good job. Still, I can't get past the complete invalidation of the entire experience of a collectors package by using these ridiculous foam disc holders.

Remember kids, plastic makes it possible. Foam is used to wrap pipes and cushion objects, not hold blu-rays to a cardboard container. So, if you're willing to try the superglue method, or you're okay with tossing the package, go for it. Otherwise, you might want to look at the individuals. At $79.99 for both volumes though, I'd be very tempted to go for it, put the discs in a dvd binder, and chunk the packaging.

On a side note, as I was writing the same review for each of the two individual volumes, I noticed some writing of incompatibility issues. For what it's worth, I've had none and am playing these on a PS3.",1230768000,,1445,4.546153846153846

The video quality is impressive on all, with Live and Let Die being the worst in the set and Die Another Day the best. The color on the older films is ever so slightly over done (a bit too much red) but again this reminds me of what it might have been like to see these in a theater in the 1960s.

The only disappointment is the soundtrack on ALL of them (compressed DTS as I can't currently decode uncompressed). The sound quality is excellent (again Live and Let Die the worst). My issue with the soundtrack is the fault of whomever remastered the audio. The effects are unbelievably loud (on a properly calibrated home theater) and the voices are quiet. You cannot solve the issue by turning up the center channel since much of the effect sounds are also present in the center channel information. I noticed the same sound issues when watching the HD broadcast of Die Another Day on SpikeTV today.

_____________________________________________
THE GOOD:
- Incredible video quality, better than what the audience saw on release date on some of the older movies.
- Lots of extras, most of them worth watching or listening to.
- Beautiful packaging.

THE NOT SO GOOD:
- The sound restoration not as good as the video.
- Some of the 'extras' sections would benefit from a 'play all' option.
- The boxes could be a bit slimmer.
- May require upgrades on certain players.
_____________________________________________

The overall impression is of quality, inside and out. The 2 boxes could be a little smaller but the packaging is exquisite. There's a transparent plastic slide cover over a solid cardboard box holding a small binder on which the individual movie disks are pages. Each movie comes on one disk, holding the movie itself and in incredible amount of extras.

The menu interface is well organized and there's is even some humor in labeling. For example, the option that plays the movie is labeled 'The Mission' while the historic promotional material is found under 'The Propaganda'. Depending on which section you may be, menu options branch into further sub-menus.

The extras are numerous and, for the most part interesting. The Dr. No disk, for example, has a very informative HD documentary on the restoration process and we get to learn who did what, why and how. Then, we see 1962 trailers, a contemporary documentary on the making of the movie, a 1960's interview with a gun specialist discussing the various James Bond handguns, even radio commercials.

The sound options include the original sound which, in the older releases is 'mono' but all movies have surround 5.1 as the default. The sound wasn't upgraded and improved to the degree that the picture was but, it's understandable. Going from mono to 5.1 surround would be the equivalent of upgrading from black and white to full-color 3-D in the world of images. The area where some of the older installments show their age is the sound.

When it comes to the pictures, the best that I can say is that you've got to see it to believe it. The restoration of the older movies started with the actual original negative, which is the one copy that's almost never touched. Once the copy was digitized as a 4000 lines resolution digital copy (Bluray is 1080) every frame was reprocessed to eliminate any possible defects from 'dirty optics', such as the proverbial hair that we sometimes see on the older movies to scratches, bad exposure, color brilliance. The restorers' goal for the end result, and this concerns the video only, not the sound quality, was to deliver what would appear to be a contemporary movie with a 60's or 70's theme rather than a 60's or 70's movies. In my view, they succeeded.

My overall rating is a solid five-stars. Just about everything in this release is superlative: the physical packaging, the interface design, the extras, the video quality. The sound is not so good on the older movies but, given the state of sound restoration technologies, I did not feel compel to remove a star because the old movies sounded more or less like they did on release date.

Please note that and I am not factoring in player issues because, sooner or later, those are going to be addressed.",1227398400,12,3738,4.874015748031496

This is Volume 1 and 2 wrapped together, it is nothing ""special"" the only thing special is the lower price.

When I ordered this, I was not expecting what I got.  I thought the movies were in standard blu-ray cases and put in a box, but I was wrong.

When you get your movies, you have a nice 007 plastic slipcase, when you take that off you have the box (which you see in the image) and inside is a very nice ""book"" that houses your discs.

Each movie is presented on 1 disc, and each volume has 3 movies.

I own the James Bond Ultimate DVD collection.  I'm going to assume you may own that version as well, and want to know if the blu-ray is worth the upgrade or not (these movies are over 40-50 years old mind you).

When I got the ultimate dvd collection last year, I was shocked at the quality of Dr NO.  This is a very old movie, and it looked better than some blu-rays I owned (and this was on DVD!), the same is true for these blu-rays.

Dr No Looks better than the majority of blu-rays I own.  Every scene is sharp.  No scene looks soft, or bad.  The restoration done on these has to be seen to be believed.

When you watch the blu-rays some of the bonus features explain the process behind the remastering (which is very interesting).

I must warn you.  If you're the type who likes to watch trailers (of the film you're about to watch) prior to watching the movie, do not do so here.  As they are almost all full of spoilers.  Think of the trailer as a recap, and rejoice in the over the top trailers of back in the day.

Now on to rating the specifics.

Video Quality
5/5 Easy.  Top Notch.  Each scene is so vibrant, so sharp, you will be soo furious with other blu-rays sitting on your shelf, because they won't look half as good as Dr No. (even modern movies shot last year)

Audio Quality
4/5.  This is tough to rate really, some of the movies were filmed in mono (and we get the mono track, which as with the dvds, I much prefer), but here we also have a surround mix to go along with it.  Obviously this is not going to be as good as any modern movie soundtrack, but it is as good as the movies have ever sounded.  Also I must comment, the only part of these movies that make you aware that the movie was indeed shot back in the 60's is the audio.  The gun shots and other special effects are.... weak by today's standards, but it is faithful to the source, and that's all that matters.

Supplements
5/5 When the ultimate collection was made, we got the movie, then a disc full of extras.  Thanks to the power of blu-ray, we have all those extras and the movie on the same disc.  All this is seamless.

Packaging
5/5.  If you read some of my reviews on other ""sets"" I really hound studios.  I have wasted 100's of dollars on ""gift sets"" that are rendered useless when they arrive due to scratching, broke discs, stuff falling out, luckily that is NOT the case here.

The design that houses the discs are similar to the way they are presented on Battlestar Galatica Season 1 (on HD-DVD) (only these actually work, and have none of the issues that set did).  Meaning you open up the wonderful book (vibrant, and full of color, I will be posting pictures tomorrow) and the discs look as though they are floating on the case.  The best way to get them off is to ""twist them"".

I really like the packing, its like a really fancy case, it exudes style.  I personally love Volume 1 more, the blue is soo suave.

Value
4/5

Ok, I can understand a LOT of work went into making these videos.  But the hardwork was already done when you remastered the video from the negatives to make the ultimate dvd sets a few years back.  Those videos came with 5 movies, with the bonuses, and now you can buy 2 of those volumes for the price of one of these (which only contains 3 movies per box). Or all 4 for the price of these 2 volumes (20 movies versus 6) all of which are basically the same.

Now, I'll admit, the quality is better, and the packaging is amazing.  But you have to ask yourself.  Would you prefer having the whole set on DVD or 6 movies on Blu-Ray.  (as it amounts to the same price)

At this rate the price for the whole set will run you around 350 dollars (with amazons VERY LOW price) not retail, retail would be 550 and that's for 18 total.  I guess you can guess they will triple dip Casino Royale, and make the set a close 700 dollars.  I hope they start either dropping the price, or adding a movie or 2 per set.

With all that said, would I buy this set again?  Sadly, yes.  They are just too good.  And the packaging is something that has to be seen to be believed.

If you're choosing, should I buy the single blu-ray releases, or get the box sets.  I would say buy the box sets (and save yourself some serious money and buy this ""collection"" on amazon)  The boxes are amazing, and the quality is very high, and it is cheaper to buy 1 volume than 3 discs (though I'm sure there might be some movies you do not want, but if you want the whole collection, its cheaper to just buy them all now)

Last, but NOT least, you get another bonus, that is not advertised, free tickets to the new Bond movie (actually each box has 2 tickets, so you get 4 if you buy this set) that's 40 dollars in value there.

If you own the DVD's and want to know, should I buy the blu-rays, or just keep watching my ultimate series upconverted, that's harder to say, if the money is no problem, you will enjoy the new set.  If you're buying this for your boyfriend or husband, he will love the packaging (I do) as it looks very nice.

When volume 3, and 4 come out on blu-ray will I buy them?  Without hesitation.  Just be sure to give me Goldeneye.

Oh, if the only versions of Bond you own, are not from the Ultimate Collection DVD sets, these blu-rays are going to be night and day for you, as they have been painstakingly remastered from the original negatives (the film that was actually used in the camera) and all flaws have been removed, making these movies as good or better than the latest big budget blockbuster.

If you're new to Bond, and not sure if you want to invest in this series, be sure to take a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001DSNF8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale (Two-Disc Collector's Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>], It is one of my favorite movies by far, and easily a favorite bond film.

This six-pack provides a sampling of Bond throughout the years - a 40+ year span in fact - from the classic ""Dr. No,"" where Sean Connery set the bar high for Bond, to Pierce Brosnan's final turn as the debonair spy in ""Die Another Day.""

Popping ""Dr. No"" into my player for the first time, my jaw practically hit the floor when I saw the luscious detailed images on a 92-inch 1080p projection screen. A 46 year old film has no right to look this good!

The main reason the films look and sound so good is that all twenty of the pre-Craig Bond films were painstakingly cleaned up and restored by Lowry Digital Images, each from the original camera negatives. The first nine films (including four of the films in this set) were all scanned in at a whopping 4K resolution, and the other eleven were re-mastered at full HD 1920x1080 resolution - a perfect fit for Blu-ray disc. While the 12 megapixel (4000x3000 pixel) mastering of the first nine films may seem like overkill, for 1080p high definition's 2 Megapixel image, the results speak for themselves.

The sound is no slouch either, with the films re-mastered in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround (the original mono or stereo track is also included on each of the older films, for the purists among us). And make no mistake, this is no cheesy pseudo-surround effect. The producers went back to the original master sound reels, cleaned up the audio and re-created a truly immersive surround sound stage for each film. If you haven't seen the early Bonds before, then you're in for a treat with these Bond classic on Blu-ray.

As to compatibility, yes it is *very* important to note that some players (notably the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LG-BH200/dp/B000YB2IPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LG BH200</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-BD-P1500/dp/B0014H16V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung BD-P1500</a>) currently have playback problems on some of these discs. But it's not fair to blame the Blu-ray Disc producers for the flaws of the machine manufacturers in meeting Blu-ray specifications. LG and Samsung have committed to providing firmware updates to fix any playback issues. But most of the current generation players (including the newer Panasonic and Sony players with the latest firmware applied) have no problems playing these discs.  The fact is that Blu-ray is still an early adopter technology and is going to have some growing pains.  But the ultimate reward to any possible frustration is the outstanding pictures and sound of which the format is capable, and nowhere is that truer than in this Blu-ray Disc set.

3520601,5,B001CXYEVA,"There will always be debates on who makes the best Bond, and this trilogy gives you a sampling of three strong contenders spanning 40+ years of Bond: Sean Connery in ""Dr. No"" - the film that started it all, Roger Moore in his first turn as Bond, ""Live and Let Die"" and Pierce Brosnan as 007 in ""Die Another Day"" the final film before the series ""re-boot.""

When I put the ""Dr. No"" Blu-ray Disc into my player for the first time, my jaw hit the floor. The luscious detailed images that appeared on a large 1080p projection screen looked more like a movie made last year than one made in 1962. The main reason the films look so good is that all twenty of the pre-Craig Bond movies were cleaned up and restored with great care by Lowry Digital Images, using the original camera negatives. The first nine films (including ""Dr. No"" and ""Live and Let Die"" from this set) were all scanned at a whopping 4K resolution, and the other eleven were re-mastered at full HD 1920x1080 resolution - a perfect fit for Blu-ray disc.

As to compatibility, it is important to note that some players (notably the Samsung BD-P1500 and LG BH200) do currently have playback problems on these discs. It's important to know that if you own one of these players. But this should not be a reflection on the software, just because the player manufacturers have improperly implemented the Blu-ray specifications.  Also, LG and Samsung have committed to providing firmware updates to fix any playback issues with these titles.

This is a black eye for Quality Control at MGM & Amazon.com. I am now reluctant to purchase any BD on Amazon.com, even though this is not necessarily their fault. Better perhaps to go to a local retailer where one can make a direct exchange if there is a problem with a Blu Ray Disk.

Rather it is a warning to those considering buying this multipack of the absolutely horrible packaging of this expensive set.  My three pack arrived today and I just open the box and was horrified at the package. I have purchased many multi packs of movies/TV shows and every other time the disks were held on a separate page in a plastic reinforced page with a plastic spindle in the middle.  This set came in a ""book style ""package with a foam rubber type spindle to hold the disk in place.  Well on disk two ""From Russia With love"" the foam spindle was missing!! The disk had bounced around so much it was scratched and looked like an old scratched disk !!!!  Regarding disks one and three the foam spindles were half torn off and surely after one play the foam spindle will certainly fall off.  Disgraceful - A pox on MGM.",1225929600,36,908,4.375

I was very hesistent to buy the releases after all the negative reviews, but I have not came across any so far. The one thing I would like to point out is that these are like watching all new Bond films especially the older ones I didn't even recognize some of the scenes which was very shocking with how much the picture has improved it was like watching brand new films. Off all the Bond films I now own on BluRay I would say be more careful with Sony's Casino Royale 2 Disc Special Edition that disc just keeps locking up in random places or cutting out and resetting itself from start one of the worst bluray releases I have seen.

The working discs have an amazing picture and sound, I'm not sure that it is worth the frustration to continue buying the Bond discs.

I have a blu-ray player with my computer. There was no firmware update available for the player. I did try a software update of the media player (Cyberlink PowerDVD) but that did nothing. I ended up buying a copy of WinDVD and that played the discs. This was after several nights of searching the Web and finding information.

I have decided to not buy a standalone player for blu-ray. It would have been useless and frustrating to spend that much money and not see anything.",1225065600,7,806,4.506849315068493

However, on my Pioneer Elite BDP-95FD player, with Firmware 3.30 installed, only 4 out of 6 James Bond movies play okay.  The ones that don't play are ""Die another Day"", and ""Live and let die"".  Mostly the menu doesn't load, or if it does after you select to play the movie from the menu, it hangs.  Also, the extras don't play.

Seems like the studios were messing with BD-Java and did not inform any hardware vendors out there ahead of time, which is the reason why these movies basically don't play on most players.

Good news though is there will be firmware upgrades.  Pioneer already has an upgrade (supposedly) but it's not available for download yet.",1225065600,17,886,4.707792207792208

Sony has promised a firmware upgrade within the week to solve this compatibility problem and when that comes out we'll see if it fixes this.

The sound really rocks also. Although the films in this set range from Connery, Moore and Brosnan some 40 years apart, they all look awesome. Of course the older Bond movies are dated, but they look great. Very sharp and clean. The colors are nice and bright. The fleshtones are right on the spot. There are amazing details that you may have never noticed in the past. The blacks are nice and deep, the daytime scenes are vivid and sharp. Alway's in focus even on closeups. Great facial details as well as background shots.  The audio on all of these disks are remastered also. They really rock your sound system. Some are better than others, but they all do a great job. These 3 titles are a great example of how Blu-Ray can show off it's stuff on a 1080P monitor.

There are a ton of extras on these titles. You will spend hours going through them all. The menus are very cool looking and easy to navigate through. I had no problems whatsoever.

As for the movies themselves. Everyone has their own opinions on that one. I love Dr. No and Live And Let Die. These classics have never looked better. Worth every penny for the 007 fan out there.
