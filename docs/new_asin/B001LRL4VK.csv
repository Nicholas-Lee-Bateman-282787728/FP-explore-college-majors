3690849,5,B001LRL4VK,"I happen to catch this flick when it was shown at the Montclair Film Festival in Montclair, NJ. Its really funny and keeps your interest the whole way through. Joey Piscopo is wonderful in it - as well as Louis Mandylor and the rest of the cast. It kind of reminds me of GROUNDHOG DAY. Buy this movie, you won't be dissapointed.",1234137600,3,328,4.306451612903226

8319603,1,B001LRL4VK,"From the reviews about this unrated movie, one is to believe that it is a wholesome family movie. Don't be tricked, it is filled with sexual discussions. I only watched a few minutes of the DVD and turned it off. Don't waste your time or money on this trash.",1329868800,,258,4.285714285714286
8319604,1,B001LRL4VK,"I'm just giving this one star on principle.  Scan the other reviews.  They all have the same wording.  The same tone.  The repeat phrases.  And they were all posted at approximately the same time.

Look -- I know that folks have to promote themselves ... but, gosh, if you can't even fake a series of Amazon reviews convincingly ... what are the odds that you can make a good movie?

BTW, I was lucky enough to see these reviews at the Duluth, Minnesota Amazon Review Festival ...",1260316800,2,480,4.448275862068965

The possibilities are endless and if you don't see this I can assure you that you are missing out on a secret that many around you already know!  Don't be left out, it changed my life!",1234483200,,280,4.166666666666667
