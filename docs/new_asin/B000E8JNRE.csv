8107059,5,B000E8JNRE,"I just spent a weekend having a Pygmalion / My Fair Lady marathon.  Out of the whole bunch, there is only one version that I didn't care for (and I won't review that one here).  This is a really fun play and most of the renditions are actually quite good, with each of them bringing something unique to the play.

However, this particular version is really my personal favorite - not only because it is well done but mostly because it was the first to present the ending as GBS originally intended.  While all the other versions are enjoyable, changing the ending really does take something away from the intent of the original Greek story that this is based upon.  I liked that this script respected the intent of the original story and didn't degrade that for the sake of a romantic, happy ending.

The acting is good all around, with no character being underplayed or overplayed.  I love Lynn Redgrave, and though it surprised me that she was cast in this role, she did a fine job of capturing Eliza Doolittle.  Certainly not as splashy as the musical MY FAIR LADY, but actually better in a lot of ways.

The only thing that bothered me about this interpretation was that Lynn Redgrave's 1970's hair styles haven't stood the test of time.  Really good costume, make-up and hair designers are able to do a period piece that will appear fresh and classic decades later.  If you can date such a film by the hair, then it has failed to be true to the period in which the story is set and has become something less than it could have been.  However, I got past this pretty easily because it wasn't egregious, but the 1970s feel was just slight.  Not a big deal.",1423699200,,1659,4.453642384105961
8107060,4,B000E8JNRE,"One of the pitfalls of reviewing a play such as PYGMALION is the tendency to compare different versions with such landmark works as MY FAIR LADY (1964) or Anthony Asquith's PYGMALION (1938).  It is far more fruitful to approach Cedric Messina's 1973 production on its own terms as a genuine attempt to rethink a well-known classic.  There are certain alterations, notably the introduction of a bathroom scene when Liza Doolittle (Lynn Redgrave) is bathed by Mrs. Pearce (Angela Baddeley), and an ending which leaves us deliberately uncertain as to whether Liza will return to Professor Higgins' (James Villiers') house or not.  What renders this BBC Play of the Month version so interesting is the quality of the individual performances: Villiers' Higgins is basically an overgrown schoolboy, accustomed to having his own way yet easily suppressed both by Mrs. Pearce and his mother (Lally Bowers).  He tries his best to bully Liza, but is eventually forced to succumb to her will.  Redgrave's Liza is a physically imposing presence, with sufficient esprit de corps to make us realize that she will not remain subservient for very long.  At the time the program was made, Baddeley was also involved in UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS; her Mrs. Pearce has a lot of Mrs. Bridges in it.  A practical, no-nonsense personality, she knows how to deal with Higgins, while realizing that Liza will only stay so long as she deems it necessary to do so.  Ronald Fraser turns in a quietly understated characterization of Colonel Pickering - although determined to work with Higgins, he realizes the Professor's shortcomings.  Messina uses frequent reaction-shots of Pickering's face to point up Higgins' behavioral absurdities.  Emrys James' Alfred Doolittle is a star turn in itself - this ruddy-faced, effervescent personality is every inch the orator, the kind of person for whom middle class morality is both the bane of his life and the passport to success.  Messina's straightforward, no-nonsense production relies a lot on close-ups for its effect; it unfolds at a cracking pace, while vividly emphasizing Shaw's satiric purposes.  Definitely worth watching.",1403740800,2,2142,5.230994152046784
8107061,5,B000E8JNRE,This DVD worked great!  I bought it for my classroom and had not viewed it.  It went with our text book almost word for word!,1397952000,,125,3.96
8107062,4,B000E8JNRE,"People expecting a non-singing version of My Fair Lady will likely be very disappointed.  This is not My Fair Lady without the music.  Shaw's original play, Pygmalion, is its own work, and I think a far better telling of the story.  Don't get me wrong, I love My Fair Lady (both the movie and the stage musical--they're not quite the same, by the way).  But Pygmalion, Shaw's original play on which the others are based, is a great story by itself.  This is a 1973 BBC videotaping of a studio staging.  The acting is quite good throughout.  Though I think Lynn Redgrave is perhaps not the best choice for Eliza, she does an admirable and energetic job.  I was particularly impressed by Ronald Fraser's Colonel Pickering.  He's not the usual ""Nigel Bruce/Dr. Watson"" bumbling sidekick, but a strong and vibrant compatriot and foil to James Villiers's intelligent, if impetuous, Higgins.  I found myself genuinely interested in the Higgins/Pickering relationship as a result, as well as the idea of two smart and capable English gentlemen engaged in such an odd and controversial experiment.  There is some cutting of the original script that I found unnecessary, though I guess it's inevitable in a television adaptation, unfortunately.  But the story holds together very well regardless.  A modern viewer may find the early 1970s BBC production style a bit stiff and the studio video environment a little harsh and flat.  But overall the production flows well and the story is nicely carried by the cast.

PROS:
--A good staging of Shaw's original play
--Strong acting throughout, especially the Higgins/Pickering relationship
--A reasonably faithful rendition of Pygmalion

CONS:
--Early 1970s production values may distract and disappoint a modern viewer
--Some overplaying by Ms. Redgrave
--Too much cutting from the original script",1383264000,3,1835,5.148648648648648
8107063,3,B000E8JNRE,"If you like old ""corny"" movies, you'll like this.  Very clean entertainment for the christian family.  Lynn Redgrave is a crack up.  The story line is silly, but enjoyable.  My teenagers and I watch it one night when we were bored.  After the movie ended we all laughed and talked about the silliness of this movie.  It was just great for an entertaining night with my kids.  It's not a great production or good quality, but it was good, humorous entertainment for my family.  A little cursing, but nothing objectionable.  Just by one main character.  Words that people would have found ""shocking"" in the early 1900's.  Other than that, a good laugh.  If you're wanting a serious movie, don't watch this.  This story is just humorous!  The ending is abrupt and interesting.  Enjoy.  I give it 3 stars just because of the quality of the production.",1355356800,,847,4.698630136986301
8107064,5,B000E8JNRE,"As someone else mentioned, the negative reviewers appear to have been unable to forget the version they know best and like most - either the film of MY FAIR LADY, or the 1938 PYGMALION directed by Anthony Asquith and Leslie Howard.  But both of them are MILES away from what Shaw actually wrote, from the play we see on stage; if we are lucky.

I LOVE both the musical and the 1938 film - how can anyone NOT adore Wendy Hiller and admire Wilfrid Lawson?  But Villiers and Redgrave and Fraser and Emrys Jones are right up there with the best actors of their generation, and make this production memorable in the extreme. I expect to return to it many times, and I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't enjoy it.

The play as he wrote it is one of Shaw's masterworks, beyond any doubt. And this is a VERY fine production of it. Worth every penny it costs.",1314057600,5,849,4.320754716981132
8107065,5,B000E8JNRE,"I have been a die-hard fan of Rex Harrison's Higgins since 1987 (when I was in middle school).  However, James Villiers is pure magic in this production.  His acting is perfection, down to his subtle reactions to the other actors.  Redgrave?  Yeah... not so great.  She is easily looked past as Villiers steal the show.",1279497600,,319,4.7272727272727275
8107066,3,B000E8JNRE,"Firstly, I think this BBC 1973 ""Pygmalion"" receives poor reviews primarily because it is Bernard Shaw's most popular play today. Is the adaptation really good? No. Does it have some merit if you can disassociate it from ""Pygmalion"" (1938) and ""My Fair Lady""? Yes.

While I do not think the acting was very good, the sets and picture quality were certainly acceptable. You could hear what the characters were saying, and the production could be a benefit for a classroom of students.

The BBC 1973 adaptation adds a few scenes not in Bernard Shaw's original play:

1.
The scene where Eliza bathes, after objecting because she felt bathing in a tub of water without clothes was unnatural.

2.
The scene at the ball, where Eliza Doolittle passes the inspection of royal society, including one of Professor Higgins' former students.

3.
An slight alteration in the ending, where it becomes clear that Eliza is going to marry Freddy.  *[This ending follows the epilogue Shaw wrote in 1941, as a negative response to the ending of the 1938 adaptation.]

Also, some dialogue from the play is cut (although not much) from this adaptation. In some respects, this is understandable. However, the dialogue that is elliminated seems to be mostly dialogue that explains that Higgins behavior towards Eliza is just like his behavior towards every else, including Mrs. Pearce.

However, let us not forget that there is a second Shaw play on the disk:

~ A 1983 BBC adaptation of ""Androcles and the Lion"", starring Billy Connolly.

This production is considerably better, although, unlike ""Pygmalion,"" there are not as many other adaptations to compare with which to compare it.",1263859200,3,1662,4.989130434782608
8107067,2,B000E8JNRE,"The best thing about this movie is it sticks with the original ending rather than the My Fair Lady ending. Other than that... I made it through the movie but I could think of roughly a dozen more pleasurable ways to spend my evening. The acting was so-so, much of the humor simply wasn't funny, and some interesting interpretations of the scene. Granted, if you're looking for something to watch while folding laundry it's not so bad.",1183593600,11,434,4.64935064935065
