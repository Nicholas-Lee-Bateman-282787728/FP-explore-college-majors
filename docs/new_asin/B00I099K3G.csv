6245063,5,B00I099K3G,"I thought I had defective disc's but they are not defective.
The episodes start the same way each time and run for about 5 minutes and 5 seconds before starting each new episode. I thought I had problems with the disc's, but that is not the case.
So anyone else out there that bought this set give it at least 5 minutes of play and it will start the new episode.
There isn't a problem with the disc's.
Just in case someone else thought the same thing I did.",1397520000,9,457,4.146067415730337

8637861,5,B00I099K3G,"Ran across this DVD set at one of the local big-box stores and it looked interesting, so I bought it. Fairly good series. There are five one-hour episodes, which looks at a variety of ghost towns across the west. The episodes tend to be short videos with a narrator providing information about what you're seeing. Sprinkled throughout there are brief interviews with people knowledgeable about the areas or the times.

I found these episodes to be enjoyable, and we pretty much binged watched the series over a rainy weekend. I would imagine these would be suitable for most young kids who might be interested in the history of the old west.",1483660800,,641,4.774774774774775
