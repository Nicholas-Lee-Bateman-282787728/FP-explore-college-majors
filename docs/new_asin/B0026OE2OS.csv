3854576,5,B0026OE2OS,I bought this set for my husband for Christmas last year and he just loves it.  He sat on the couch and teared up over certain parts of it.  He was very appreciative of it.  The service was great - it arrived a day early even so close to Christmas!  Thank you Amazon!,1266192000,3,267,3.981132075471698
3854577,3,B0026OE2OS,"First off, this is a typically excellent NFL Films documentary.  It covers the team origins and the 1964 and 1965 AFL championships nicely, with good footage of Cookie Gilchrist, Lou Saban and Jack Kemp.  Plenty of footage on O.J. and the Electric Company, Joe Fergusen and the early 1980s, then lots of great coverage of the late 80's, early '90s dominance.  The reason I gave it three stars is because they messed up the bonus features.  The box shows six bonus features on the first disc, but four of them are not there (two were replaced with others).  The program does not include the features on Jack Kemp, Cookie Gilchrist, Thurman Thomas or Jim Kelly!  Instead, it includes Marv Levy, Bob Kalsu, Scott Norwood and Joe Delamielleure.  Same problem with the second disc.  It advertises a bonus feature on the 1963 Bills season, which is not there.  Instead, it has an excellent America's Game program on the 1990 season.  Being a fan of the 1960s NFL and the four-superbowl run the Bills made in the 1990s, I wished the as-advertised bonus features were actually on the discs.",1263772800,20,1082,4.737967914438503
3854578,5,B0026OE2OS,This DVD was a great treat for a longtime fan. It's packed with lots of interesting facts and indepth interviews. The 1990 season review was fantastic! Gave me chills. A must for any Bills fan.,1252022400,2,193,4.542857142857143
3854579,4,B0026OE2OS,"All I can say is that I am one proud Bills fan after watching this DVD! I would recommend it for anyone who calls themself a fan...It's certainly not easy to capture a team's 50 year history in only 1 hr and 45 minutes but this release is solid. You'll learn not just about the team, but which players & coaches were most beloved by Bills fans and the city of Buffalo. I've only had the chance to watch the main documentary so far, but that alone is worth buying this DVD for!",1249516800,4,476,4.129032258064516
3854580,4,B0026OE2OS,"I liked this dvd. It provided the history of Buffalo Bills in a detailed manner. But do not trust what the back of the case said esp. when it is saying that it has 1963 Buffalo bills highlight on 2nd disc and has features of Jim kelly on 1st disc. There are 4 less features than it is stated and on 2nd disc, instead of having 1963 Bills highlight, it has 1990 Buffalo Bills America's game missing rings.",1249430400,11,404,4.1923076923076925

3854589,5,B0026OE2OS,I have been a Bills fan since I was 7yr old (41 Now) so seeing the 70's & 80's brought back memories if your a Bills Fan this is a MUST Have #BILLSMafia,1370822400,2,152,3.6363636363636362
3854590,4,B0026OE2OS,"A good documentary of the history of the Bills (as I'm a die hard fan) but it's missing some important things worth noting

- Well first off, they made no indication that Bills running back O.J. Simpson got away with double murder and it seems like they pretend it never happened just because O.J. was an explosive player.

- They never mentioned the 1992 Regular Season game against the 49ers which resulted in a lot of scoring with a victory for the Bills in a 34-31 blowout, and get this, there was no punts in that game at all. The last time it has happened for both teams to not punt in the game so far.

- They claim the Music City Miracle was a forward pass, even though it was already proven to be a lateral. It's crazy that so many Bills fans deny this obvious fact. I'm a die hard Bills fan and I accept we lost that game fair and square.

- They never mentioned we traded O.J. Simpson for the first overall pick in 1979 for Tom Cousineau who refused to play for the Bills. we traded him for the Browns for their first round pick that was used to pick Jim Kelly.

No a bad DVD, let it pass.",1360281600,,1100,4.121495327102804
3854591,5,B0026OE2OS,Unknown to most people is that the NFL Films Americas Game-The Missing Ring is part of this as an extra feature. This is a great football dvd . Really enjoy it.,1359504000,,160,4.193548387096774
3854592,5,B0026OE2OS,"I really really enjoyed this one! To me, Marv Levy is one of the GREATEST Coaches ever! Imagine going to a Superbwol 4 years in a row!? What shame that they lost,but in my heart they WON! If you LOVE the BILLS!!! BUY THIS!",1359417600,2,222,4.068181818181818
3854593,5,B0026OE2OS,"As my title states, I'm not what you would label a Buffalo Bills fan by any stretch of the imagination.  That being said, I purchased the DVD in the hopes that it would have some good footage from the 60's and 70's that would add to my archives of NFL Films material that I already have.  Needless to say, I was very happy with the purchase that I made here.  Great background material on the Bills during their formative AFL years, and the link that both the team and the owner had with the Detroit Lions of the NFL.  In addition, the interviews with Lou Saban, Billy Shaw and the coverage provided to the Bills championship teams of the mid-60's were equally enjoyable.  And as can be expected, a great deal of coverage was spent on the OJ Simpson years, as well as the Bills run in the late 80's, early 90's.  What made this DVD get 5-stars though was the bonus features of the NFL ""Missing Rings"" episode of the 1990 Bills, along with the AFC Playoff game comeback against the Houston Oilers.  Those two items were worth adding to my library alone.  The other ""extras"" contained segments on Bob Kalsu and Marv Levy as well.

Would I have purchased this DVD at full price?  Probably not, as I managed to find a new copy for about $5.00.  But if you are a Buffalo Bills fan and looking to add to your collection, know that much of the material presented here was not a bunch of recycled material from old NFL DVD's or VHS reels from before.  For that, I give NFL Films kudos on the compliation that they came up with here.",1358726400,5,1524,4.327464788732394
3854594,5,B0026OE2OS,"Tremendous footage of the my team.  The box is mislabeled, but I knew that going in thanks to another review.  This is a must have for all Bills fans, especially those 35 year old and younger like myself.  There is a lot we missed!!",1344902400,,232,4.2272727272727275
3854595,5,B0026OE2OS,"This is great product for a lifelong Bills fan in that it both infromed me on the team's history for the twenty or so years before I was aware of the team and let me relive some great memories (the early 90's) and some not-so-good memories (everything else) since then. Until I saw this DVD all I knew about the Bills before the mid-80's was Jack Kemp and O.J. Simpson. I learned about how great of a player Cookie Gilchrist was, the fact that in the late 1960's the Bills started the first african american QB in pro football and how O.J. Simpson was completely misused in his first few years with the Bills.

This has the usual high quality NFL Films production values and has footage of even the earliest games.

As someone who was born and raised in Buffalo but has had to move, this DVD features the bonus of seeing Buffalo media figures I grew up reading and watching guys like Larry Felser and Van Miller giving their commentary on the Bills and the nostalgia of once again hearing the ""Talking Proud"" campaign.

If you're a Bills fan, a Buffalo native or an anthorpologist with an interest in an important part of life in western New York, you will enjoy this DVD.",1341360000,,1172,4.441860465116279

8353270,4,B0026OE2OS,"Gives a lot of history of the early AFL years. I was surprised the 1st video didn't comment on the 4 back to back Superbowl appearances of the Bills in the early 1990's (painful for all Bills fans). Unless you're a football historian, or an ardent Bills fan who watched them from the beginning you'll probably find some unexpected surprises. But for the those who aren't ardent Bills fans you most likely won't appreciate this, and feel the pride of those days, or even know the records and players. Most likely meant for we ardent Bills fans, through good times and bad. Maybe they'll make a sequel regarding the Rex Ryan years, considering he used to curse at his new team. God bless Ralph Wilson, Lou Saban and Coach Levy.",1424649600,,725,4.584615384615384
