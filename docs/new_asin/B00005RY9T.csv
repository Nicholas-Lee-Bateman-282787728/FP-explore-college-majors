7952725,2,B00005RY9T,"LADY IRON MONKEY-do you need to know more about it?  Alright, I guess so.  It starts out with monkey lady casuing a bit of mischief with a dwarf and a fat guy.  Now that shoul have beeen the name of this.  Also in ths openingscene of the mvie, monkey ladies monkey friends show up in their halloween monkey costumes.  Wow, I gave this movie 20 more minutes and this is what happened.

Monkey ldy has a weird masdter who decides to transform her into a real girl , just like little mermaid, lol!!!!!!  Before that she meets the great Chen Sing, he is a prince and wants to haev her around to learn her super special skils.  And then once she becomes a woman, she stil has a tail.  SO a woman asks""you need to decide if how to take the tail off or shwo her hwo to use it as a weapon"".  The old master says ""OK, I will teach her how to use it as a weapon""  LOL f'ing hard.  I really was just about to turn it off right here but then Chen Sign showed up.  That meant i had to stick around to the end:(  But the girl is evry skilled in kung fu at least, or at least she puts on one hell fo an act.  But back to Chen Sing, Him and Lo Lieh fight!!!!!!!!!!  Wow, I was truly forced to endure the entirety of this movie now.  So the story is somewhat similar to ""rebellious reign"" and is about a pribce who is going to change the will (chen sing) so he can eb emperor.  Great.  So he becomes empeopr and then kills the people who helped him.  A really weid but good ending.

So the movie is just godawful and add in some really really stupid music, I give it a 2/5 .

Picture is full screened and a pretty bad picture quality, but still very watchable.

EAGLE'S FIST-so this movie starts out with Chi Kuan Chun telling his brother that he is leavin gto go learn kung fu. WHAT?????????? Ok well, he says next that becsause he is an officer and there is a badass gang around, he wants to get tougher.  I was like alright, I guess so, but I knew there was gonna be some fastforwarding:(  But then surprisingly, I stuck with it, and actually enjoyed a few fights.  The master he goes to train with actually ends up beign somewhat enjoyable.  And the story is bad but still somewhat intriguing, but only cause of the plot twist at the end.  HEY, anything for another good fight, I am all for that!!

So the final fight is long and obviously VERY good and this movie would have gotten a 1 without it.

I give it a 2.5/5.",1150502400,,2405,4.076923076923077
7952726,5,B00005RY9T,"Eagle Fist is one enjoyable movie.  It has all of the elements you'd expect from a martial arts film.  It's all here--training scenes, fight scenes, revenge, betrayal.  This film is a great addition to your collection.  Now for the other movie... Lady Iron Monkey.  Marred by cheesy wire work and somersault ""martial arts"", it borders on the bizarre and insults your intelligence feeding you the idea of the existence of hairy monkey women that can be cured by bathing in herb water for a week.  The master is a joke, he hardly teaches her anything she didn't already know.  If you can get past that the action is alright, but the wire work really leaves a lot to be desired.  The dwarf and the fat guy have to go.  5 star for Eagle Fist, 0 stars for the cheesy off-the-wall premise of Lady Iron Monkey.  This DVD is worth owning for Eagle Fist alone.",1027900800,3,851,4.467532467532467
