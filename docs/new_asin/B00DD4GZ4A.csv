As an Equestrian Vaulting coach and athlete I will be adding many of them to my repertoire of exercises to use on my students and myself.

You can follow along with the video but it is not flashy or flamboyant. It is very direct and to the point. I just wish the kids in the video looked like they were having more fun.

Oh. This didn't effect the star rating at all because its totally not the seller's fault: Use one of the upgraded shipping options if you want your DVD to arrive in anything approaching a reasonable timeframe. The US postal service is pretty useless. It took well over a month for this package to get to Sumas.",1425945600,4,801,4.517241379310345
8592124,5,B00DD4GZ4A,"Young kids make strength gains primarily though neural adaptions. This is essential in setting a good foundation for technique training and it eliminates the occurrence of ""bad habit"" formation. This video prepares the young student for ballet technique by focusing on training children to use the correct muscles. Doing so early on makes the transition to full barre and centre much easier and less stressful for both the student and instructor since the students will have those neural adaptions for proper body placement and muscle use. Great and smart video!",1411689600,2,562,5.2555555555555555
