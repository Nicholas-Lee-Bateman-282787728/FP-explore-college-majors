8321860,5,B001MUHD6Q,"Anyone who watched this movie didn't watch it for its cinematography or its eloquent prose. It was a walk down memory lane. Meeting an old friend. You remember the wonder that was in your eyes when you saw it. The smell of the popcorn. The feel of the cardboard box in your hands. The look of the smoke from a patrons cigarette as it drifted through the projectors beam on its way to the silver screen. A brief look into a time long past. You watched it like you might think of a good memory. Remembering the things that surrounded it and you in that time.
Thanks for the memories.",1489536000,,581,4.290909090909091
8321861,4,B001MUHD6Q,"A very entertaining western, well made, with solid performances from all cast members.  Paramount got this one right, even when casting William Bendix in, what I believe, was his only western role.  The story of a trio of outlaws takes a turn when two of the three become lawmen, while the third stays with his lawless ways.  It has the requisite gunfights, escapes, open range, and  progress versus lawlessness conflicts, along with the young woman drawn to one man but loved by another.  This blend, though predictable, is very entertaining and certainly worth a look.  For you western film buffs, like me, it is a welcome edition to your collection.  My only disappointment is that it can only currentlybe obtained in the PAL, region 2 (European) format, making ownership a two step process if your DVD player isn't capable of playing PAL formats.  One needs to have it converted to the U.S. format for viewing......an added expense.  C'mon Paramount.......get with it and release this gem to the U.S. market.",1440720000,,1012,4.940828402366864

8321863,1,B001MUHD6Q,"this was a very poor picture quality, fuzzy grainy,with static like affects. It was almost like the movie was either pirated or was copied on sub-standard equipment.",1389052800,,165,5.148148148148148
8321864,5,B001MUHD6Q,"This is the very first Western that I remember seeing.  I was 10 years old when I first saw ""The Streets of Laredo"" and it began my love affair with the Western genre which has never diminished through the years.  It has been a real pleasure to purchase and watch ""Streets of Laredo"" again after so many years have passed.  It's such a classic story about friendship and betrayal.  All of the actors do a fine job portraying their characters.  It's  the first movie I ever saw with William Holden and he was the first cowboy I ever fell in love with.  While this particular film isn't rated as high as his later westerns such as ""Escape from Fort Bravo"" and certainly not ""The Wild Bunch"" it is a good little film and a pleasure to watch. It's wonderful to know that many of William Holden's older films are available on Amazon so many of us can purchase them again or watch them online with Amazon Prime.",1380412800,4,905,4.383233532934132

Mona,of course,is the object of the boys affection.
Soon,Williams pal William Bendix is killed by McDonald setting William against McDonald. Needless to say,it comes to a showdown.
After seeing this you will say,They don't make westerns like this anymore.

8321866,5,B001MUHD6Q,"I bought a region free player so that I could watch this DVD. Too
late that I found that it played perfectly on my computer. There is
a little problem with motion regeneration. I set my TV to high regeneration
so who knows where the problem is in converting from PAL. I still am very happy
with this DVD. Too bad it was not released in a NTSC version. If you like
westerns, you will love this movie.",1319587200,4,399,4.128205128205129
8321867,5,B001MUHD6Q,"Paramount's STREETS OF LAREDO is a remake of an earlier (and arguably better) Western made about ten years earlier. Nevertheless, STREETS OF LAREDO is entertaining and fun. After its famous Zane Grey series of the 1930s, Paramount stuck to making bigger budgeted ""A"" Westerns for the most part. STREETS OF LAREDO brought star power and a good story to the screen, the age-old tale of what happens when friends take different paths. This edition is in the PAL format, so you'll need an ""all regions"" DVD player (and they can be had easily enough). Recommended.",1259798400,2,559,4.894736842105263
