8116301,2,B000F0H4ZY,"While it has a few interesting advises, most of them are common sense, even for us who are first time parents. For instance, everyone knows that you have to remove the plastic in which a new mattress is packed.
It also lacks depth in the topics it covers. For example, it only spends a few seconds on breastfeeding, while we were expecting to learn breastfeeding positions, how to know when your baby has had enough milk, and how to burp the baby.
It wasn't worth the money for us.",1343347200,,481,4.415730337078652
8116302,1,B000F0H4ZY,"-Immunization doesn't cover all of the current ones.
-Car seats are old-- three point harnesses are not even made any more! And the information about use is not very thorough.
-Safe sleep information is HORRIBLE!!!  She says, ""Use bumper pads""!!!!!!! YIKES. Please do NOT USE BUMPER PADS- THEY ARE VERY DANGEROUS!!!
-Some of the images and clothes are very dated.",1331683200,,363,5.05
8116303,3,B000F0H4ZY,"This item does have some valuable information, but it isn't a must have. You can learn much more from simply reading what to expect, or other similar parenting books. Not really worth the money or time.",1312502400,,202,4.638888888888889
8116304,5,B000F0H4ZY,"This DVD was a great purchase. I am a soon to be first-time mom and have ordered a handful of dvds and books on newborn and baby care. If you were to choose between this DVD and Bringing Baby Home (The Ultimate Baby Care DVD )definitely go for this one!

This DVD focused more on safety tips for newborn care, which included a lot of information I truly had not known before and that other DVD's do not mention. I cannot list them all here, just look at the Product Description, it lists all the info you should expect to learn about.

The video is short compared to others, but it focuses on what is necessary and does not drag on with interviews and unnecessary info.",1276128000,2,669,4.301587301587301
8116305,5,B000F0H4ZY,"This was an enormous help to us in those early, sleepless months of raising our twins. Wish we'd had it when we were raising our eldest!!",1145836800,,137,4.3076923076923075
8116306,5,B000F0H4ZY,A friend of mine is a childbirth educator. She uses this program in her childbirth classes and recommended it to me. It is really well done. It covers all the important information I needed to know during pregnancy. I really liked that it is not a talking head lecture but has real pregnant parents and real nurses. It also has some nice animations to help you understand what happens to your body during pregnancy.,1145404800,,415,4.621621621621622
8116307,5,B000F0H4ZY,This dvd gives you all the information you need to know about baby health and safety for the first months of life. The information provided is presented clearly with easy-to-follow demonstrations by real parents. I highly recommend this video.,1144713600,2,243,5.256410256410256
