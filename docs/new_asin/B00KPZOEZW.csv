8660683,4,B00KPZOEZW,"It was a great movie with action, some romance & Comedy, the comedy part was from 2 great Punjabi actors (B.N. Sharma & Binnu Dhillon) who are very entertaining to watch in comedy movies but their part made no sense in this particular movie. It would of been 5+ stars otherwise. To see Gippy play a more serious role was cool.",1455408000,,326,4.360655737704918
