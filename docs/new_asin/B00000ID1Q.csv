7910306,1,B00000ID1Q,"Some movies are bad...but this one really creates a whole new level of awful. C. Thomas Howell stars as an escaped con aboard a futuristic prison-transport spaceship who escapes and holds the plane hostage, while the hero tries to thwart him and save them all (which he does, of course. What do you expect?). It's terrible: terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible special effects. It's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back. Turn away now.",988156800,,459,4.822784810126582
7910307,1,B00000ID1Q,"A very bad movie in general. Too many scenes with ""actors"" running around, shooting things and just looking confused.(I was confused my self by the lack of plot). It's as though scenes from 100 other bad movies were compiled to make this one, amazingly bad movie.
It's sort of like the 3 stooges in space but not funny.",986774400,,319,4.517241379310345
