8267868,5,B0017ZCHUS,"I own all four DVDs, and they are all outstanding in offering nourishment to the mind. Contrary to one reviewers opinion who said you could find some just as good on YouTube, there is nothing even comparable to these DVDs on YouTube. The little 5 or 10 minutes offered on YouTube pale in comparison to almost an hour on each DVD. The igetreal products are professionally done and will inspire and motivate you. I would recommend them to anyone.",1289952000,4,444,4.632911392405063
8267869,5,B0017ZCHUS,"From the moment Abundance begins to play you realize that you are about to view a powerful and empowering message.  Namely, we have within us all possibilities.  Mr. Ercoliani, with his beautiful photography, graphics and words, shows us that in order to receive abundance we need to give abundance.  He reminds us that abundance does not necessarily mean money (but that is a good thing also).  We need to be generous in our joy, expect it; share it.  We need to be generous with our love, expect it; share it.  The DVD tells us to be grateful.  One of the things I am grateful for is that there are people like Scott Ercoliani who help to make this world a better place.",1209686400,18,672,4.459016393442623
