6197301,5,B00HQI7YK8,"These 13 hours are simply amazingly entertaining. Bobby Darin sounds wonderful even though he would sadly die in just a few months after these shows aired in 1973. The programs are extremely entertaining and are virtually all music with each guest artist well represented and dozens of Darin solo songs.

Repeated songs have been edited since Bobby sometimes sang the same songs on multiple episodes and the last show, which was already released on its own single DVD as a Bobby Darin concert, has been trimmed of most of that material but includes all of the Peggy Lee solo and duet footage not previously available. So, even though some material from the original broadcasts has been removed, there are dozens of Darin performances not seen in decades along with super guests like Dusty Springfield, Petula Clark, Helen Reddy and Nancy Sinatra - as well as comedy fun with Sid Cesar, Tim Conway, Phyllis Diller, Cloris Leachman and even pop-rock artists like Bread and Seals & Croft. A wonderful release for any fan of great popular song and singers plus beautiful video and audio quality and the half-hour documentary with Bobby's manager Steve Blauner, friend Sue Cameron and colleague Connie Stevens is poignant.",1397174400,15,1217,5.024752475247524
6197302,5,B00HQI7YK8,"Bobby Darin was an extraordinary performer, certainly one of a handful of the greatest entertainers of the last century and this box set keeps that tradition alive.  Forty one years after it was shown, this series is still a delight and, with the exception of a few large musical production numbers the like of which we haven't seen since that era, feels fresh and fun.  Darin just had the magic that can't be diminished by time.

If you're new to Darin, you may be surprised at the breadth of his song stylings.  Each show closes with Darin singing Mack The Knife, his biggest hit, and each is subtly different but always rousing.  He moves from the American songbook to Dylan and everything in between, doing it all with ease.  Darin may be primarily known as a singer but his movements and rhythm add a fabulous dimension that can only be appreciated on DVD.  His voice is just one part of the magic.

If you're new to Darin, you may be surprised by his amazing comic timing.  In a recurring bit as an Italian mafia grandmother, he all but twinkles and his straight man, Geoff Edwards, often has a hard time keeping it straight. There is warm, gentle humor to be found as two longtime friends, Angie and Carmine, sit on the stoop in The Neighborhood, sharing the stories of the day.  Both of these comic characterizations remain astonishingly relevant and timeless, as well as funny.  Another character, perhaps not as timeless but no less funny, is Dusty John Dustin, hippie poet and his bongo player sidekick.

If you just remember Darin as the kid who sang, and wrote, Splish Splash, you might be surprised at his charm with his guests, as well as the audience.  He does a steamy duet with his lady costar of the week on most episodes, each sitting on a stool in profile as they sing to one another. He might do outlandish comedy with Flip Wilson in the next segment and follow that with a sweet segment singing ""There Was An Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly"" with young (5-ish?) Charlene Wong.

You might be surprised by Darin but it will be a pleasant surprise and you'll always be entertained.  I found myself grinning at the  screen, just enjoying the magic and the mastery of Bobby Darin.",1397001600,18,2195,4.561224489795919
6197303,5,B00HQI7YK8,"The Bobby Darin Show may well be the very last of the grand TV variety shows done in the classic style. Sonny and Cher, Donny and Marie and their ilk were more campy, more deconstructive, in their way. Bobby Darin was a throwback to the Rat Pack.

It's also a study of a extraordinary performer giving his/her all, almost to the point of collapse. (Judy Garland's TV series is another example.) Here is a singer/actor/musician/showman who is seriously ill. Darin had struggled with health issues since childhood and when he was doing this series, his irregular heart beat often made him in a dreadful state when the cameras stopped rolling. He passed away only a few months after the series left the air.

But when the cameras were on, all the audience sees is a consummate entertainer with seemingly boundless energy and a personable quality ideal for television. He also had the rare quality of reaching audiences of all ages by singing Sinatra pop, country, classic rock and roll and blues, all in a way that came naturally. That was because there were many Bobby Darins -- he was one complicated fellow. Everything he had he gave on stage.

The TV show, whose writers included Alan Thicke and regulars included versatile TV host/radio personality Geoff Edwards, followed the basic variety format. The first few shows' finales salute a specific city with its music, there were assorted sketches, commercial bumpers with Darin as Groucho, and what had to be the most personal of the sketches, ""The Neighborhood.""

""The Neighborhood"" was akin to Jackie Gleason's ""Honeymooners,"" a slice of life in the tough, working class streets of New York, surely as much a part of Darin's early life as Gleason's. Darin plays Angie, the voice of reason, while character actor Dick Bakalyan (who appeared in numerous Disney comedies, as well as voicing the lead in the Oscar-winning ""It's Tough to Be a Bird"") plays Carmine, the dreamer who always hatches a money making scheme or is snared by a fishy endeavor.

Darin's other characters include a hippie poet and ""The Godmother,"" two more personas that come from his life as living in a trailer on the beach and in the company of tough old Italian mamas.

The shows also include another unique regular feature, in which Darin sings to his female guest, face-to-face, both in a highly seductive way that says more than the most of today's more overt depictions of romance and general bedroom hijinks.

This was the early '70s, so many of the songs have that groovy sound. The dancers have that Disneyland ""Kids of the Kingdom"" vibe. It's also interesting to see what fine singing voices guests like Dyan Cannon and Cloris Leachman have. (Ever strange, Leachman does a butterfly number that is characteristically bizarre.)

But it's the last episode that is most unforgettable. Watch the bonus documentary for the background. Because of a lack of rehearsal, Darin performed pretty much his entire Las Vegas act while Peggy Lee simmered in her dressing room, waiting to go on. Once she did her segment with Darin, the tension is palpable, yet fitting as the duo sings very dark songs of lost loves. By the end, the two have connected as two giants of song interpretation.

One can only speculate what Bobby Darin would have given the world had he not died at 37. This DVD truly captures lightning in a bottle.

6197304,3,B00HQI7YK8,"Unless the descriptions in ""Bobby Darin On Stage and Screen"" are wrong the shows on the set are not complete. This is also evidenced by the fact that the 13 I hour shows are on 3 DVDs with a total running time of 9 hours. What is very disappointing is that what seems to be missing are many of Darin's songs.

What is called a new ""documentary"" are 2 extended interviews with Steve Blauner and Connie Stevens. There is no booklet and no notes. The set appears to be very cheaply done.

But as a Darin fan, and also looking through a historical lens, I am very glad this footage was finally released.  What's disappointing is that these are NOT full, uncut episodes.  Portions, including songs, have been deleted.  One episode is only 25 minutes long!  And a couple of the announced guest stars (like Bill Withers) do not even appear because of the cuts.  While the packaging certainly does not state that these are the original, uncut episodes, it would've been nice to know that I was purchasing edited episodes.

6197321,3,B00HQI7YK8,"I have been a Bobby Darin fan for over 50 years.  The man in my opinion was/is one of the MOST talented people to come out of AMERICAN entertainment factory.  He was funny, a GREAT impersonator, a fine actor and SING OMG his voice is PURE MAGIC.  I did not grow up in USA and so I only heard about this TV series  and spent many years pining away and wishing I could see it.  Then I heard he did a duet with my all time Favourite female vocalist DUSTY SPRINGFIELD.  And so when I knew this was coming out the anticipation was unbearable.  So I may have been overhyped with anticipat I O N  thus giving the show NO CHANCE of pleasing me.  I went straight to the Dusty segment and was horrified.  The show was dated and awful.  The dialogue was corny and mundane.  And some of the Guest were dreadful  Sid Caesar was abysmal  worst performance of anyone I have ever seen.  What the hell was he thinking.  Enough about the bad stuff.
The only reason to buy this is to hear BOBBY sing  that is NOT awful, abysmal or dreadful  THAT is ABSOLUTELY fabulous..  Bobby was first and foremost a multi genre singer.  Any song any style  and the voice THAT VOICE  out sang EVERYONE  including Frank S.  Compare Frank Sinatra's version of Always and Bobby's  point made.
I was VERY disappointed in the overall shows  not sure who the writers were  but they were NOT good.  BUT never in Bobby's singing.  If you had/have never heard of Bobby Darin and watch this you might wonder what all the fuss was/is about  if you fast forward thru the non vocal material and just watch BOBBY sing  you will be left in NO DOUBT that he IS Americas greatest musical TALENT  ever.",1402444800,,1651,4.311475409836065
6197322,5,B00HQI7YK8,"Bobby Darin a great performer- actor, singer, comedian . There was nothing that he couldn't do. This show proves that and more.. All true Bobby Darin fans must own this set to highlight their collection of his body of work. It is truly amazing all the he accomplished in only 37 years of life...",1402099200,,295,4.481481481481482
6197323,3,B00HQI7YK8,"If only they had released this on DVD a year ago, when I first got my inheritance: when I finally saw this in May --and just yesterday, June 6, I recall when I watched this in 1973, I was inspired to want to produce my own variety TV series. If I'd gotten this when I first got my money, I'd have spent it renting and furnishing a studio to rent to aspiring TV variety artists, and would have produced my own show! I used to know many of them via Public Access TV. In 1973, this show was one of my big inspirations for show biz.
As for the DVD, it is upsetting that the DVD stalls on disc 2, and I can't see two of the shows. I've been watching all the eps, to document for imdb, so there can be a record there. I was hopeful reading that his estate did not know the eps were edited. Even so what is there to be enjoyed is wonderful.  You can see how Darin loved performing, and to watch a performer who is filled with joy is the best.
Young 8-year-old Charlene Wong's semi-regular appearances are limited to just a few (at least 2 shows with her edited her out completely. I knew she was on the shows because her name was in the credits and those shows were too short on the DVD). I had remembered her for years, but never could find anything about her, so was looking forward to seeing her segments again (I was a young girl at the time I first saw the show, so I was a fan--so was someone else, who sent in fan mail, which Darin read on-air, showing the fan-drawing of him and one of Charlene).

RECOMMENDATION TO BUYING THIS: If you really cannot wait, buy it, but beware of being upset at the edits and maybe your DVD not playing. If you can wait, maybe they will come out with a better version, later, but who knows how long that will take? If I could, I would produce a better documentary, myself. The one included here was useful, and it was good to see Connie Stevens here (WOW! Still looks good! What amazing hair she has, too!), and the info was valuable, but I would have liked a booklet and longer documentary. I was very irritated that time was taken up by ads for some other DVDs, instead of longer shows. I do not agree that shows which had duplicate songs should have been edited-out. That was NOT the only reason they were edited. Some other reasons are at play.

But really, the more I see of disappointing DVDs, the more I want to do this as a living, to create documentaries for DVDs.  And I would love to produce a variety series! This one was wonderful.",1402099200,6,2476,4.184486373165618
6197324,2,B00HQI7YK8,I watched these shows in high school and have been hoping for years to own them on DVD. I am very disappointed by the songs by Darin that have been left out.

6197325,5,B00HQI7YK8,"what a great gift to all Bobby's fans, as well as those who know his music, but had not really seen him entertain live.  The last Time I has seen this show, was when it originally aired on NBC.  For it's time, and even now, its still terrific, and also a great tribute to Mr. Darin's almost unending resilience throughout his illness, to complete each show.  He still swings, croons, and belts out each tune with class, style and the indelible and original Bobby Darin mark. I'm so glad they cleared all the legal hurdles after so many years and got this finally released!.  I HIGHLY Recommend it!  .",1400284800,3,600,4.467889908256881
6197326,3,B00HQI7YK8,"I wasn't around when 'The Bobby Darin show' was originally broadcast. I was born in the following year. Besides, I don't live and have never lived in the US, which may account for differences between my cultural and television background and sense of humour and those of the original viewers of the show.

All of this said, I've loved every minute of the three DVDs, which I've watched in a marathon today to celebrate Bobby's 78th birthday (I haven't seen the special features yet). I do believe that taste has changed since the seventies, and I find some of the sketches nave and perhaps a bit dated. But that's something with which I've never had any problem. I do like this sort of stuff, and I've laughed my head off many times when watching these DVDs. In fact, I'm not half sure I prefer today's sense of humour. I already had most of Bobby's songs (on the 'Seeing is Believing', 'Aces Back to Back' and 'Mack is Back!' DVDs), but I've really enjoyed seeing him in those I didn't know, as well as in the comic sketches, and even playing chess. I do love eveything this man made (uncritical as this may sound, I can assure you I'm not saying this blindly - I do try to be critical about things I like or dislike, mainly when I'm giving my opinion to other pepople).

The reason why I am giving these DVDs only three stars is the obvious one many people have already stated: that the shows are heavily edited. The Bobby Darin Show, as a TV programme, deserves five stars: these DVDs don't. I'm not knowledgeable enough about everything Darin to know exactly what has been left out, but the only-9 hours included in the DVDs are clear proof that something (a lot) must be missing. Jeff Bleiel's 'That's All - Bobby Darin on Record, Stage & Screen' book gives some clues, but the author acknowledges that his information about these shows is not complete. I would appreciate it if other people were able to tell us what is missing and in which part of each programme.

On 2nd May, a disclaimer from the Bobby Darin Estate was published on his official web site, regarding these DVDs. I don't know whether links are allowed here, but you can read it by looking up that date in the News > Darin News page of the site (which can be easily found by typing 'Bobby Darin official website' in any browser). The Bobby Darin Estate were unaware that the shows would be edited, and are disappointed with the release of these DVDs.

Honestly, I was relieved to read it. For one reason: in a way, it leaves a door open to the possibility that the entire shows will be released some day. As a whole, I am happy to have bought these DVDs, because they have lots of things that weren't available before. I know some people wouldn't buy a hypothetical second release with the complete shows, having already bought this one, but I, for one, would. I do hope that the Bobby Darin Estate will work on a big project including not only the complete programmes from 'The Bobby Darin Show', but also those from 'The Bobby Darin Amusement Company'. All that material, together with a lavish presentation including a booklet, would make it worth buying even for many of us who have already bought these three DVDs.",1400025600,13,3192,4.517301038062284

6197328,4,B00HQI7YK8,"Waited years for these shows to be issued and now we have them, Darin was pure talent, Singier, Actor, Impressionist and Songwriter.  His tragically short career was a great loss and anyone wanting to see what they missed if they were not around at the time should invest in this set.

Pity about the Amazon packaging, much to large box with normal DVD Case inside holding the 3 Discs, case rattles around due to know polystyrene or paper protecting it, beware if buying from outside USA, case may arrive damaged because of this.  Could easily be mailed in usual Amazon DVD pack.

6197329,3,B00HQI7YK8,"No-one can expect a variety series such as this to not age in forty years, but this one seems to be have worn less well than others.  The show seems to be all over the place both in respects to material and quality.  Musically, the show is sound but mostly unremarkable.  This is in part due to the house band, which was presumably put together in order to be adaptable to both big band and rock/country music.  It ends up sounding more than a little thin, and the rockier songs don't rock enough, and the swing numbers don't really swing.  Everything seems watered down.  There are moments when Darin rises above this, and makes us forget these issues.  His version of Don McLeans Dreidel is superb, for example, as is his bluesy take on Come Rain or Come Shine.  Elsewhere, there are problems musically  the second episode features an awful version of Born Free.  Here, Darins health problems are most evident.  In this episode (and on a number of others), he looks ill and his singing suffers.  This is hardly surprising  less than a year later, Darin would be dead  but fans have rarely seen Darin looking ill, and so it comes as quite a shock to see him clearly suffering.

The comedy sketches and the guest stars are problematic.  The Neighborhood sketch in each episode (see pic) is a delight, with Darin showing off his acting talent with aplomb.  However, some elements backfire  particularly the ridiculous poet section and the sequences involving The Godmother, which often leaves a somewhat bitter taste in the mouth.  Tastes have changed, and this section has aged about as well as the one where he plays chess (Im not kidding).  There are some lovely moments with the guests  Bobby and Flip Wilson are a delight together, his story about meeting Donald OConnor is sweet and moving, and the duet with Elke Sommer is remarkably sultry.  However, many of the guests are unworthy of duetting with Darin, and darin certainly deserved bigger names than the show often attracted.

The biggest problem with this DVD release, though, is that many of the shows are heavily edited  and its often the  musical numbers that have been excised.  One show runs barely 25 of its 47 minutes.  Key songs such as Something, Caravan, Bridge Over Troubled Water, Sixteen Tons, Lonesome Road, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square and Once Upon a Time are not included here, and this means the set provides relatively few solo songs that are not available on Aces Back To Back, Mack Is Back and Seeing Is Believing.  This is a shame, and a missed opportunity  and, to be brutally honest, false advertising.  Nowhere on the packaging does it say any shows are edited.  Many buyers will therefore find themselves watching Bobby Darin playing chess, but not singing an number of the one-off performances of songs that the series has to offer.

While this is nice to have, it is ultimately a disappointment.  Its clear to anyone with a knowledge of Darin that the series was hardly a success, but to have it butchered like this is not showing Darins final chapter in the best way possible.  Bobby deserves better than this.",1398729600,36,3110,4.719330855018588

6197331,4,B00HQI7YK8,"Before the mid 80s when variety shows died any performer in their hey day were given a prime time variety show. Some were flops(The Jacksons. Marilyn and Billy, Susan and Mel, Engelbert Humperdinck, Judy Garland)  while others lasted a good 4 or 5 years which in variety show land made it a success. (Donny & Marie Sonny & Cher, Tony Orlando Tom Jones Flip Wilson). The Bobby Darin show was not a ratings hit but was not cancelled for low ratings. It was unfortunate the world lost Bobby the same year after the first season ended. Shame too because it was a decent show and Bobby had a great voice and believe it or not was very good as a variety show host... I don't like that some numbers are cut (the duet with Dyan and Bobby is not in the show and what makes it stupid is they leave in the intro where he says I am going to sing with Dyan now but it never happens. At least edit it to look like there was no duet.. I hate the edits. I know variety is hard to release and we rarely see full uncut full seasons of shows and I don't  get it. I know its music rights and royalties issues but for gods sakes cut the crap. this was classic television and we deserve to see what it was like in the good days of TV. Unlike stupid reality shows of today this was classic TV. Non of the variety shows even make it to channels like Antenna TV and so forth...it just makes NO sense......Even though on almost all these shows the comedy sketches are outdated and not funny anymore, the music is awesome. Yes I have the Carol Burnett time life set and even a lot of her sketches have lost their appeal...but I still want to see these shows in full and uncut....too bad we never will...",1398470400,2,1676,4.185758513931889

Yes it is chopped up, yes the packaging is cheap, yes it has fault's ( not as great as casting Kevin Spacey as Darin 10 years ago AND letting him sing) however it's GREAT to be able to see this outstanding performer shine. The most gifted artist that ever lived.",1397692800,2,385,4.579710144927536
6197333,4,B00HQI7YK8,"I remember watching the four 1972 Summer test episodes, (where are they?) Announced nearly two years ago, It has been a long wait but felt it was hopefully being done right. Well anything new to DVD by the masterful Mr. Darin is welcome, But I feel compelled to write (whether concert parts of the series have been previously released or not) that the episodes are heavily edited. By reading the box and very well detailed insert with original airdates and great extras, I was surprised to start off with episode #1 missing at least 10 minutes, then episode #13 (last produced concert episode) runs 21 minutes! For a collection that advertised itself as releasing 13 Bobby Darin Show hours, with a total time of over 7 hours over 3 discs, a standard edited disclaimer due to music licensing should have been included somewhere on the packaging.",1397520000,4,844,4.787671232876712
6197334,5,B00HQI7YK8,"The man was a genius, decades ahead of his time. Long before crossover artists became common, Darin did it with ease: jazz, R&B, pop, folk, Country-Western, etc. He dominated a stage and audience like no other entertainer. Sinatra bowed to his in concert abilities. he was also a damn good actor and songwriter. Already a legend, he would have been a gargantuan icon had he lived another twenty or more years. Suave, sophisticated and witty. RIP, Mr. Cassotto.",1397433600,2,460,4.910256410256411
8634264,3,B00HQI7YK8,"I was looking forward to seeing and hearing more of what I have already seen on yutube. Jim Pierson does it again at MPI and screws people over.
Bobby was wonderful with what you saw. I really enjoyed the Godmother skit and Carmen and Ang. Showed Bobby's acting chops that unfortunately he never really got to use in film and tv. Bobby gets a 5 + but MPI and it's snip snip gets 0. I hope the Estate still owns the rights and puts the show and even the summer show he did for NBC out on DVD & Blu Ray. I was in college at the time of Bobby's death and I remember hearing about it on the radio. What a loss to the entertainment industry not only as a talent but as a human being. He was proof of the old show business adage ""The Show Must Go On"" RIP Bobby and thank you.",1493337600,,769,3.9358974358974357

8634266,5,B00HQI7YK8,"Upon receiving my copy of this series I called the producer MPI to question why they had left so many of Darin's songs out, & was told it was related to money. If the complete shows had been printed intact the fans would have been much happier, after all Darin performing is the reason for our purchase as many of the songs had not been  produced on CD. I agree with most of what Shane Brown has posted. Did not like the Poet bit, I felt it demeaned him & probably why he told Steve Blauner after 4 shows he was not happy & wanted out. I love his rendition of Driedel also. However as a mad Darin Fan I will treasure everything I have purchased & always replaying my collection, Cassettes, Vinyl, CD's VHS's & DVD's.& 8 books related to him.",1474934400,,741,4.21830985915493

The shame is that so much was cut out, and so we were only given half shows. I'm so grateful to have them, I just wish that we could have had the whole shebang.
I am praying that we will get the Bobby Darin Amusement Company shows in their complete form. It would be a wonderful thing to have Bobby being funny as well as singing his glorious songs.
As another reviewer said, There is never enough when it comes to our Bobby's work!!! Golly he is missed by all! What talent taken from us at such a tender age.",1449792000,,592,4.112068965517241

8634271,3,B00HQI7YK8,"I love it!  It is about time they put this series on DVD and allow those of us who enjoy this exceptional entertainer with another glance at his talent.  I love the intelligence, humor, voice and dancing moves Bobby Darin had all those years ago.  I haven't seen these shows since they originally aired except for ONE.  It is such a treat to watch these skits again and the singers popular at that time sing everything LIVE.  My gripe is NOT with the show and the material; it is the incredibly poor decisions made by the company putting out this DVD.

Whomever chose to edit this DVD did a remarkably poor job.  Excerpts from the last show appear here and there; chunks are deleted, performers who were on the shows completely gone! I don't understand why the people who have access to the original tapes didn't just let the shows stand on their own.  Instead, they threw out chunks, inserted chunks from other air dates and made a mess of the show.

Who did they think was going to buy this DVD?  Their audience has seen Mack is Back and know how wonderful the last taping of this show was!  WHY alter it?  For those few who might be reading this, the last show taped for this series was an extraordinary hour+ long concert where he gave everything he could (despite being VERY ill with sepsis the day it was taped) which was released as ""Mack is Back"" and yet, the company that put out this DVD decided NOT TO SHOW this extraordinary effort by Darin in its entirety; they cut 70% - 80% of it OUT.  I was glad to see the Peggy Lee segment included which I had not seen before but really, WHY choose to yank out over half the show???  I don't understand their decision.  It turned out that this was the LAST show of his ever taped; he died a few months later of heart disease.  They also chose to cut out several other segments from these shows - WHY??? - including  the segment of Eric Weissberg (who is the banjo player for the famous ""Deliverance"" movie segment).  WHY??  Mr Weissberg is incredibly talented, rarely videoed, and they chose to chop out his entire segment.  The editors did that on several occasions on this TV show.

I don't understand editing these tapes some 40 years later after their taping.  WHY???  it makes no sense!!  Would it have cost that much more to include the entire shows as taped?  Seriously.....Especially when one considers Bobby's point of view on censorship and editing.  I know he'd be furious.

I also had wished they had included the shows he taped a few months earlier that were the preclude to this one - The Bobby Darin Amusement Hour.  I am still looking for those broadcasts...I don't understand why the same people (they own all of the rights/tapes to these shows, too) didn't include them here; that is what I thought I was buying.  Wait another 40 years for those to be released???",1441929600,4,2833,4.478515625
8634272,3,B00HQI7YK8,"Interesting for television historical value.  While watching through the approximately 9 hours of television performances about four months ago, I really do not have any special memories of anything outstanding here.  The musical guests rarely sing any of their hits, although Helen Reddy does a nice version of Peaceful, although it could be a lip-synched recording.  The comedy sketches are not very funny and come off as cornball and dated.  Bobby Darin does perform most of his hits though throughout his run.  If you love Mack the Knife, you will be in heaven, as he performs half of the song (if not more) during the closing of each show. The best show overall would be the last one which was totally musical performances including duets by Bobby and Peggy Lee.  For the most part though, this comedy variety show is entertaining, but very uneven.  For each good section of the show, there seems to be an equally excruciating one.  The backgrounds that they use for the vocal segments, especially for the guests, are ridiculously thrown together, trying to be psychedelic and meaningful at the same time.  Unless you are a fan of Bobby Darin, or are interested in some of his guests on an extreme scale, you can easily pass on this one by without feeling guilty.",1439510400,,1268,4.806451612903226
