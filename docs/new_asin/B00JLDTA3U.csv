6378508,1,B00JLDTA3U,"Ridiculous ninja movie FAIL.  The story and dialog was stupid.  The fighting was lame with repetitive camera shots.  Visual effects were cheap.  Acting was as good as they could do with the dialog and story.  Entire movie shot on a dirt road and in underground building, the lighting was annoying.  Continuity was hilarious though the way the director went back and forth from the 5 girls alone to one girl in the crowd, back and forth over and over.  This movie is an insult to the Ninja movie genre.  None of the story makes sense but if you want to see a major movie fail check it out.",1408320000,,588,4.37962962962963

6378510,5,B00JLDTA3U,"Great martial arts/sci-fi adventure.  Tons of action!  The amount of action you want from a movie like this and then some!  The Post Apocalyptic fantasy elements are a plus!  And the fight choreography is fantastic!  The filmmakers show fights without covering everything up with fast edits.  Very refreshing.  If you like Mortal Kombat and The Warriors, you'll dig this one.
And it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Recommend!",1407196800,8,429,5.205882352941177
6378511,3,B00JLDTA3U,"Ninja Apocalypse is set after a great war has ravaged the planet, and the human race has regressed into separate warring clans. But its not all bad, because the fallout from the great war has also gifted each clan with cool powers. Some can throw lightning, others can throw fireballs and everyone seems to be well trained in the martial arts. Sounds pretty cool right? Well hold on there a moment, because this new post apocalyptic world also has to contend with Zombies!

The hows and whys of the great clan meet up in the story are beside the point, and the plot doesnt bear even the lightest scrutiny. You also won't be enjoying super sharp dialog or even really care all that much for the undeveloped characters.

What does matter in a movie like this is the action, and on that front, Ninja Apocalypse is a big win. The fight sequences are well choreographed, and thankfully not edited into an incomprehensible mess. They are shot in a way that allows you to see whats happening, and showcase the impressive physical talents of its cast. Add to that the occasional decent special effect as each clan incorporates their unique gifts into the action, and Ninja Apocalypse is a lot of fun to watch.

If you enjoyed films like Mortal Kombat, then I think youll enjoy this too. In my opinion this is better than Kombat, because it doesnt take itself as seriously, and the fight sequences are more fun to watch.",1406764800,8,1411,4.613545816733068
6378512,2,B00JLDTA3U,"I rarely write reviews but this movie was awful enough  to make me feel  like doing a solid to people out there if only to warn them of the potential waste of time and money. The reason for 2 stars?  Well.....On a positive note: To be more than fair the technical aspects are well done including the sound picture and the cgi based fx are  two or three steps above usual  syfy channel flare. On the other hand .....the characters played by the best actors in the movie  get killed by the midpoint of the film and it goes down the elevator shaft from there.

 After a promising yet criptic intro, it only took 3 minutes after the main title to realize i was watching a rip off of The Warriors with  a little of Mortal Kombat and a dash of Walking Dead for ""groan"" inducing moments. ..... (big spoiler here) The main master of the biggest gang, I mean, clan of ninjas calls for a meeting of all the leaders of the clans in their kingdom with the purpose of making them sign in to a truce in order to stop their infighting and peacefully join together to fight a bigger threat. (see where this is going?)
During the meeting, Zirus ....I mean the Clan  master is murdered and the blame goes to the misfit, yet super honorable lost clan who then  find themselves attacked from all sides and have no choice but to find a way out and hopefully back to the safety of their own ""lost "" village.( in Coney Island......LOL). Along the way they have to fight warriors  representing some of the different gangs present in the meeting including an all girl clan of slutty sexy amazon ninjas (and of course the zombies in the basement .....if you are brave enough to see this mess  ... you will understand what I mean). Each clan has some form of power a la Kombat and use said ability in their fighting. (you will also recognize the actor that plays Shang Tsung in the Mortal Kombat movie )

6378634,3,B00JLDTA3U,"I feel very lucky that, despite the increasingly daunting prospects of funding, I live in a time when independent filmmakers can indulge the craziest of ideas. Ninja Apocalypse is not the most barking cinematic outing you can find, but it is an exercise of creative abandon. I imagine director Lloyd Lee Barnett (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-You-to-Death/dp/B00B1OWF8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love You to Death</a>) trying to decide on whether to make a movie about ninjas, superhumans, or zombies and saying Screw it - Ill make a movie about all of them! Though low-budget movies on all of those subjects abound, Barnetts effort is still a modestly unique and entertaining adventure. While its not for everyone, its an effective niche flick for adventurous viewers.

The story: Framed for murdering the master of all post-apocalyptic ninja bands (Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/47-Ronin/dp/B00HEPDGKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">47 Ronin</a>), the leader of the Lost Clan (Christian Oliver,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hercules-Reborn/dp/B00JXNBX2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hercules Reborn</a>) and his compatriots must face mutants, zombies, and their fellow ninjas as they fight their way out of a subterranean bunker.

The most important things director Barnett brings to the production is enthusiasm and a sense of pacing. I cant claim that any technical or dramatic aspect of the film is anything more than a mixed bag, but directorial fervor bleeds into the story and gives it the energy thats so important to B-movies. We never get a good handle on any of the characters, but the plot is fun to follow in the same way that its fun to play a video game. There are so many cool ideas stuffed into the feature  reptilian desert ninjas, regenerating zombies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Airbender/dp/B002VPE1BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Airbender</a>-esque control of the elements, etc.  that its easy to feel overwhelmed, and none of them are examined thoroughly, but theres enough indulgence to recognize this as an attention-maintaining tactic. Its effective, if you know what you're getting in to.

Despite the amplitude of people throwing electricity, fireballs, and particle weapons at each other, this is foremost a martial arts film and features a ton of fighting. Like the special effects, its a mixed bag, but even at their worst, the fights are pretty bearable and the performers are admirably athletic (including Christian Oliver, even though hes substantially doubled for his tricking). Swordfighting is the name of the game, and to this end, the movie benefits from the inclusion of supporting stars Alex Huynh, Alvin Hsing, and Ernie Reyes, Jr., even though they only get one match apiece. None of the fights are exceptional, but there are some neat examples of close-quarters choreography and an absence of annoying camera angles and editing tricks. Tentatively, I approve.

Chances are that Ninja Apocalypse will not dramatically affect your life, so if you decide to watch it, I suggest doing so during a time that you would have spent being unproductive anyway. Consider it a rental, but do consider it if B-movies are your thing. You can do much worse.",1451606400,2,3409,5.961145194274029

6378636,3,B00JLDTA3U,"The leaders of several post apocalyptic mutant ninja clans are summoned together in a sort of peace summit in an underground bunker to deal with an outside threat to all the clans.  The peace summit is ended by an act betrayal when the Head Ninja in Charge is apparently killed by Cage, the leader of the lost clan.  The remainder of the film chronicles the lost clan's delegation as they fight off the hordes of ninjas bent on revenge and mutant zombies bent on snacking on them.  Time is running out, as the lost clan's delegates must escape the bunker in order clear the clan's name and save it from destruction.

Entertaining enough, not too much to write home about but the fight scenes were decent.  It kinda reminded me of the Warriors but not nearly as good. definitely not as well acted.  If you watched this through to the end and have never seen the warriors, you should really look it up and give it watch.

8652126,3,B00JLDTA3U,"This movie is a really mixed bag of good and bad things, and it really belongs in the 90s.

First things first - This movie rounds all the bases and throws in all the cliches of a BAD B movie Action film - or a REALLY good Japanese Anime (LOL).

It's got Zombies (not another zombie movie... please stop making these),
An Over the top Post apocalyptic setting (complete with exploded moons, but somehow the whole thing takes place in the rural countryside, or in what looks like an abandoned factory basement),
Martial Arts, and Ninjas (the cheesiest part of the whole thing...)
Magic

Overall the combination of elements is ALMOST offensively absurd.  Like mixing Lemon and milk, but somehow it comes out tasting good anyway.

The premise is based around An entire civilization destroyed, and somehow, someway, everyone left alive is a Ninja.  Not a traditional Japanese samurai style ninja, but a corny cheesy hong kong kung fu movie style ninja complete with ninja magic and absurdities.  They live according to some Code they never really explain, and everyone has a sword or throwing knife, or ninja star.

There are cheesy corny clans that each have some special corny super power.  Including Gratuitously oversexy ""sirens.""

to be brutality honest, by the time the movie was over, I was shaking my head saying out loud how stupid the movie was.

But if I am being honest, I must also admit I was swinging my Bokken around the whole time getting totally Tsuba deep in the action!

And this is what saves this movie.

The action is what most people agree is cool about this movie.  While the martial art part may not be 100% realistic or traditional or whatever, it's still entertaining, and fun.  The inclusion of Magical ninja powers really takes this movie from being a super lame B action movie, and gives it something unique.

I would say that if they hired a REAL writer and not some genre mixing Hack, the movie would have been better.

But then again, in some ways that might have ruined the ninja magic somehow?

As for the ""zombies"" part.  That element of the story felt forced and added in just to appeal to the waning Zombie genre fans.  The zombies didn't have any of the traditional zombie rules, they could be killed just by normal wounds that kill living people in the movie, and bites don't turn you into zombies.

It's just a gratuitous and shameless way to say it has zombie in it.

Anyway, treat this movie almost like a parody with really cool action and you will like it.

I can't help but admit with some guilt that as much as I was groaning and glad when it was over, a part of me liked it enough to give it three stars.

Go in with your expectations in check, and you might come out liking it.",1471996800,2,2723,4.544147843942505
