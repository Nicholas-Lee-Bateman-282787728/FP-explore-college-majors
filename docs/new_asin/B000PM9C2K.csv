8192365,5,B000PM9C2K,This one of the few vintage railroad film collections out there on the Great Northern. It is a real gem of collected footage from the Great Northern's latter days with some narration.,1443398400,,183,4.75
8192366,5,B000PM9C2K,"I originally owned this in a VHS format (bought it in the late 80's or early 90's) and have since purchased the DVD.  If you're a Great Northern Railway fan you should own this.  To see vintage GN steam in action is amazing.  Anthony DeRosa, a GN employee, did all of filming in this series and has left us a legacy that would have otherwise been lost forever.  If you're a rail fan, especially a Great Northern rail fan, you won't be disappointed.",1428105600,2,448,4.36144578313253
