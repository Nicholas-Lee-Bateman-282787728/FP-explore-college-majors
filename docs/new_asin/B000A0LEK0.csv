2348536,1,B000A0LEK0,"I really like Claire Danes as an actress as well as Sean Penn (as an actor, not a person).  Anyway, unfortunately I rented this due to them being in it.

I came here to the item page not mainly to review it but to see if anyone actually likes this movie and see that currently there are no positive reviews at all.

I often see people say 'this is the worst movie ever'.  I can only think of one worse off my head, 'Pinocchio 964'.  And I am considering really bad movies such as 'Car 54, Where are You?' and 'Anger Management'.  So while I don't think I will ever call any movie 'the worst movie ever', I will definitely say this is one of the worst movies ever without fear of exaggeration.

The movie is set in the year 2021.  In this far off distant future time, things will pretty much look as they do know but people will be unexplicably dying in the streets and other people will just step over them as normal occurence.

Also, the entire world will be snowing at once and I guess it is implied that all people will die.  (Or maybe not?  All the main characters die and it is stated that the entire earth is snowing all at once.) This 2021 environment has no connection to the story and the viewer is left asking why this was an aspect of the film.  It is such an unformed plot point that the characters wonder why it's snowing in July and the freezing of the entire Earth at once seems to take the entire world by surprise.

The main storyline has Phoenix's character coming to have divorce papers signed by this famous Ice Skater wife.  They become reinvolved and he finds out they have made 3 copies of her.  (I assume they are clones, but they never use the word 'clone' in the movie, so again, even to say this is an assumption)

The reason seems to be because she has a bad heart and is going to die so they want to keep making money using the 'clones'.

The film is full of illogical situations.  For example the 3 'clones' meet the original skater and are amazed that she looks just like them and marvel to have a twin.  Yet the 3 clones have been hanging out together without having any awareness that they looked exactly like each other.  But suddenly when they meet the original, 'wow, she looks exactly like me!'

There are MANY comparably illogical happenings.  This movie is full of them.

Sean Penn is only in the movie for about 3 minutes total.  His character is entirely unnecessary in regards to the main storyline.

Claire Danes does a good job portraying her emotions but nothing in the story causes any connection to care about.  Her talent is totally wasted here.

Phoenix seems to realize he got involved in a totally directionless project and appears to be reading his lines like a deer caught in headlights.  He seems to be in a state of shock and regret to have signed on to a movie with such shattered story and direction.

Most bad movies, you can see how they missed the mark.  This movie leave you wondering even what the mark was that they missed.

I have to believe it will be a long time before I see a movie this bad again.  I can only hope not.",1128211200,4,3087,4.296360485268631
2348537,2,B000A0LEK0,"When a film begins with a statement like this from the main character, it usually means that a biopic about a terminally ill patient is coming or that the director wants to make it clear that you're in for a downer.  In IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE it is clearly the second alternative. One has the feeling that Thomas Vinterberg and writer Mogens Rukov had in mind to make some visceral musings on the future of the planet given the current state of abuse of the environment and human relations, but the result is a convoluted mess of an admixture of infantile script and plodding camera work and silly character non-development that is more of a bore than a sociological/psychological/environmentalist wake-up call.

Year: 2021 though costumes, cars, technology are very much 2005.  The TV Big Brother (newscasters) are calmly reporting that Uganda is freezing, that countries in Africa are loosing gravitational pull, and everywhere in the world people are dying in the streets (merely stepped over by pedestrians) from a disease of the heart: the heart ailment etiology is apparently the lack of love and caring and commitment and relationships that have become extinct in this purely industrial society.

Enter John Marchevski (Joaquin Phoenix) returning to New York for a quick stopover to have his divorce papers signed by his estranged star ice skater wife Elena (Claire Danes).  But when he arrives in New York he is picked up by men who claim he must go to see Elena as she has a premiere that evening and couldn't meet him at the airport.  Reluctantly John goes along with this (largely abetted by encouragement from his brother Marciello -Sean Penn - who maintains telephone conversation  with him while flying in a weird jet (despite his past fear of flying).

To make it brief, Elena has been cloned by the agents who manage her star career and have tied this into her family including her father David (Alun Armstrong) and brother Michael (Douglas Henshall).  Elena senses all is not right, pleads with John to help her and eventually they escape on the run from the 'bad guys'.  Oddly it begins snowing in July, John and Elena discover her clones skating and watch them murdered, and suddenly we're in a vast tundra of frozen land with John and Elena dancing while Michael informs them the 'association' had him sell them out in order for him to survive and Marciello just keeps writing about the world and chatting from his big impaired jet plane trapped in the sky for lack of landing fields and the Africans float up into the air etc etc etc. Yes, it really is that silly.

There are some interesting panoramas courtesy of cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and there remains the underlying suspicion that perhaps the film has something to say but just can't decide how to say it.  The use of Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes, and Sean Penn is a waste of talent and it remains a serious question as to why they signed on to be a part of this film.  Maybe the good parts are on the cutting room floor...Grady Harp, September 05",1127779200,2,3033,4.7542857142857144
2348538,1,B000A0LEK0,"I had never heard of this film until I was doing a search for the film 'A Lot Like Love'. This film popped up in the search results and when I saw that it starred Joaquin Phoenix and Claire Danes and it took place in the somewhat near future, I figured I would give it a shot. Well I have seen it and now I know why I had never heard of it. This film is awful. The whole cast should be ashamed of themselves for even signing on to do this film. This is a good mix of actors and their worst films are not as bad as this. I can only think that their reasoning behind doing this film had to involve blackmail. This is a poorly put together film with at least four different storylines. You have your clones, freak weather that is threatening to freeze the world, people in Africa that are suddenly floating up into the air requiring them to tie themselves down, people falling dead in the streets and people just walk right over them. And of course Sean Penn popping up from time to time to give words of wisdom. All of this is thrown together into one giant crappy film. Like I said before, these actors are capable of so much more and I cannot fathom why they made this film. Just remember if you choose to watch this film I warned you in advance.",1127606400,12,1246,4.131687242798354
2348539,3,B000A0LEK0,"""It's All About Love"" is an art film set in the very near future (2021) that tries to dissect the moral ambiguities relative to cloning. It does so in the midst of several somewhat confusing storylines.

One involves an estranged husband and wife (Joachin Phoenix & CLaire Danes) -- a world class ice skater that is the subject of cloning -- a brother that tries to warn them about it, another brother on a jet writing a story about the world (Sean Penn), a highly dysfunctional family gathering, and an ecological disaster that ensures it snows everywhere in the world simultaneously.

If this sounds confusing, you're on the right track. The sum and substance of the plot is the cloning, which Danes' handlers are doing to ensure she continues to skate even after she retires. She and husband Phoenix try to escape her certain death and do so into the current unfriendly ecology.

At times a gripping thriller and alternately a ponderous art film, ""It's All About Love"" deals more effectively with the topic of cloning than the failed ""Godsend"". Yet the artful Kubrickesque production tends to slow down what little action there is, defeating any momentum that builds in the tense moments, creating a very episodic and disjointed experience.

Still, this is a thoughtful art film that succeeds at capturing the viewer's imagination through a combination of plot, solid acting, extreme visual imagery, storyline subtext and outright mysticism. If you had seen this at the Sundance Festival as a 20-year-old it would have left an indelibel impression and be one of the most memorable films of your young life.",1127260800,3,1609,4.948148148148148
2348540,1,B000A0LEK0,"I set my Tivo to search out SciFi films and this is what I got. This movie is a success in just one sense, it is a triumph of ""artistic"" gibberish over logic. SciFi it is not; unless a languorously shy ice age and other utterly ridiculous departures from rationality (like Africans floating around in the air due to an inexplicable and selective loss of gravity) is what now passes for Science Fiction. This is fiction without science and a torpid story that lacks intellectual gravity. Somehow, the writer manages to throw clones into the mix without even the slightest regard for reason. This mess makes no sense. Apart from the writer's apparent fixation with planes and hotels, the script goes where the actors go; nowhere. Occasional strolls down the street or walks through the airport by the characters invariably include encounters with dead bodies just lying about. Evidently, these forlorn folk croaked because of broken hearts. But, sentiment dies there as the New Yorkers depicted in this brain dead film take no notice of the corpses and routinely step over them without blinking.

There is a great deal of sleeping that goes on in this moronic production. Throughout the film, the principal characters are constantly dropping into unconsciousness, which is exactly the state the director must have been in when he should have been directing.

This movie is a tragedy; a personal tragedy for me since I shall never recover the hour and fifty minutes that were stolen from me by the blackguards responsible for this piece of.......art.",1122768000,,1547,4.969111969111969
2348541,3,B000A0LEK0,"Unless you are a die hard fan of Joaquin Phoenix, like I am, you will probably think that this is one of the top ten worst films of all time. The futuristic plot isn't too bad, but one minute the characters have a russian accent, and the next they don't. Sean Penn has about 5 minutes on screen, but has a voice over in more parts of the film.

So like I said before, unless you love Joaq, don't bother buying this.",1122595200,3,415,4.060975609756097
2348542,3,B000A0LEK0,"And I can't quit watching it.  I recorded it on DVR from cable in the US.  I thought that Joaquin was terrible the first time I saw it, after being such a fan of his from Quills and Gladiator and other movies I've seen of his (and both of those have heavy accents, so what gives with him?).  But in subsequent viewings, as I often do, I think I finally get it.  It is not too meaty of a part and he is trying to play kind of an ordinary guy to his skating star wife.  Reminds me of Tom Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut, the nerdy doctor.  Claire Danes, on the other hand, is outstanding.  She reminds me a lot of Franka Potente (Blow, All I Want, Run Lola Run).  I watched her TV series long ago and liked her but she has grown into an amazing actress.  They both had a little accent problem.  They were supposed to be Polish and I kept telling myself that Joaquin was brought to the US as a baby (I'm *really* trying to like him).  Claire has her moments when she reverts to American, but does a much better job.  Sean Penn's accent is over the top, completely (but he makes a good Greek Chorus).  I am surprised at him as he is usually so prepared.  I have to blame the director for this, for there is a thread of the actors not caring, just going through the motions (except Claire).  It is set 20 years in the future and very plausible (except I hope the concept of cell phones changes!) and where the gravity holes in Africa show up is anyone's guess.  But the basic plot is pretty cool.  I am a figure skater and they got it right, mostly.  I could tell the skating doubles were not world class skaters, but most people wouldn't notice and the choreography was very nice, as was the music.  I really like the premise that if people are lonely or lovelorn, something goes to their hearts and they die, and I think a lot of people will relate to that.  I have watched it about 5 times now but I think it would have a specialized audience which is why I gave it a '3'.  Don't buy this for your kids for the skating as it is *very* violent in the rink.",1121644800,6,2046,4.090452261306533
2348563,5,B000A0LEK0,"Of course this film wouldn't be appreciated in this day and time. It's about romantic love in the chaos of world change. We have none of that right now. Love is pre-nupts and celebrity merging. There is no poetry in today's romance and we're all the worse off because of it.

That said, don't even watch with this film if you disagree with above; but if you long for some semblance of romantic films like ""Now Voyager"" and ""Dr. Zhivago"" wrapped in the milieu of a world destroyed by big business then get your copy now!",1242518400,3,519,4.40625

2348565,5,B000A0LEK0,"An apocalyptic, fantastic dream of a love story wrapped up in a hallucinatory cocktail of poetry and karma, this movie is at once thought-provoking and way too much effort, so it is bound to be a ""love it or hate it"" kind of viewing experience. Especially the first time around. The telling quote used as the title of this review, by the way, is from the films' writer, producer and director, Thomas Vinterberg.

OK, so people are dying in the streets of NYC from lack of love, the world is freezing over, and Ugandans are floating away while the sinister Russian ice-princess cloning plot goes on. This movie is ridiculous and at the same time a commentary on so many things that are going on under our collective noses, right NOW (even if many of us can't/won't see it), and the choices we all have right in front of us.

In my opinion, ""It's All Aboout Love"" has way more pluses than minuses. It's well worth checking out, especially if you liked ""Gattica"" or ""The Fountain"". The cinematography is perfectly surreal, and the ""good vs. evil"" mentality you find in most movies today has been elevated to a ""love vs. fear"" kind of vibe. A strange, wonderful and terrifying film, made for a strange, wonderful and terrifying world.

Led by Joaquin Phoenix and Claire Danes,""It's All About Love"" is narrated by Sean Penn. If you didn't like it/get it the first time around, I would suggest that you try it again. For me, the first viewing merely aroused my curiosity and compelled me to give it another look; the effort was well worth it.",1195257600,10,1536,4.598540145985401
2348566,1,B000A0LEK0,"Truly awful! I'd say this is one of the worst, if not the worst movie I've ever seen. I was tired when I started watching this, and couldn't figure out why I was perceiving no story and terrible acting, it was like a bad dream. I gave it 20 minutes before fast forwarding purely just to see if Clare would 'get her kit off' to warrant the R16 rating, but alas there was no redemption. I saw the comparisons to ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""Lost in Translation"" on the back of the DVD. Ha ha, that's rich! Vanilla Sky is definitely a cerebral movie, but is clever, edgy and well written (nothing in common so far). Lost in Translation is nothing like this movie, a slow and subtle touching encounter between two strangers in a foreign environment. Joaquin is so much better than this, yet it was like watching a school play being rehearsed badly. The same applies to Claire, who was actually pretty good in Shop Girl and who knows what Sean was thinking? What a waste of energy and talent, quite like sleepwalking really. Zee from Egypt liked it, perhaps it is 'lost in translation'? :)",1193270400,3,1074,4.456852791878172

WRONG! This movie has actually hurts my brain. It looks pretty, cinematography gets an A. Everything else is downhill. People are dropping dead from ""lonliness in their hearts"" all over new york, there's some sort of coming ice age theme running in the background and early on an interesting bit about Ugandans flying, but they don't really explore that subject much at all.  Oh, and there's figure skating, musn't forget that, cloning, pills, alternate realities, etc.

Claire Danes is supposed to be from Poland- the accent is horrendous, on the brightside though sometimes she forgets to use it for whole scenes at a time. Near the end you can tell Joaquin is supposed to be Polish too, but his bad accent doesn't show up until the last 15 mins of the picture.

The movie is all over the place, after I was more then half way through I found myself hating almost every minute, but still watching- clinging to the hope that they would somehow tie it all together and it would in some way be a return on my time investment. It never happened.

It's not bad in a campy cute John Waters way, it's bad in a Battlefield Earth / what have I done to myself kind of way.",1184544000,6,1382,4.624489795918367

The casting is terrific, with Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes and Sean Penn.  Claire Danes is perfect for her part in that she can mimic a puppet in certain scenes.  The direction is solid and the film is well-done.

The problem I have with the film is that it's so.......weird.  It's one of those films where you wonder where it's ""going"" all thru the film, and really don't get the satisfaction of finding out @ the end.  Yes, I get the apathy = cold part, but still....it paints with a very wide brush, toying with so many different ideas.  It touches upon another Ice Age, human cloning and some other topics which are just plain ""out there.""

2348570,2,B000A0LEK0,"In the year 2021, people in Uganda have to chain themselves to the ground because they might start to fly up in the air to their certain death. You are not safe in New York City where some people literally drop dead in the street and no one cares. Thomas Vinterberg throws his peculiar ideas into his film starring Joaquin Phoenix, Clair Danes and Sean Penn. Oh, and Penn's role is just a cameo, a traveler on the airplane perpetually mouthing philosophical soliloquy about the cosmic collapse.

The film follows Joaquin Phoenix's character arriving at New York where he meets his separated wife and ice skater played by Claire Danes. Before signing the divorce paper, Danes confesses that something weird is going on, and begs him not to leave now. Dane's brother (Douglas Henshall) seems to know the truths, but he won't tell it to her.

Let's face it. I couldn't understand what is going on in the film, but I do understand that `It's All Bout Love' is part thriller, part love story and part warning from the director about the humans living in modern society. The film tires to be all of them and becomes none. To their credit, the cast (not all of them) and the crew did a good job. Claire Danes is impressive showing effectively the vulnerable personality of her character, and the photography is stunningly beautiful.

You may say this kind of film requires intelligence or literacy. I know some films use symbolism or metaphor, but I don't see anything symbolic or meaningful in the absurd concept of the flying Ugandans. Maybe by introducing these people or Sean Penn's character in the plane the film wants to suggest that we have lost our roots and our lost souls are hovering in the air. Or maybe it is about our inability to communicate to each other. Speaking of which, however, film is, I think, also a media based on communication between filmmakers and audiences, and for all its ambitious and novel concepts, Thomas Vinterberg's film seems to forget we need to connect to the world it tries to describe.",1169683200,2,2022,4.706214689265536

I liked the idea of a man falling in love again with the wife he was planning to divorce.  I didn't mind a little intrigue in the plot, but this movie couldn't decide if it was a ballet or a thriller.  It was poor at both.

Why bother with Sean Penn's narration from an airplane?  What was with all the people dying in the streets and no one taking notice? And worst of all, what was the point of the flying Ugandans?

I think the screenwriter, in his vainest atttempt to be original, swung the pendulum so far to the other end it completely broke off.  Back to basics, people.  Back to basics.

THE LACK OF LOVE. not in the shallow sense, Romance, but in wider deeper sense. its what we have become now..and imagine what we will be in 15 years from today. the news reporting people flying in Uganda.. today news reports of all the people dying in stupid wars here and there.. they are both absurd! got it?? the last image in the film, where people are tied to ropes trying to stay oin earth... isn't it a strong image? to summon all these ideas? people trying hard to stay on earth, survive..

I cant explain this movie to you, simply cause it's made for adults.. grown ups, and if you are over 18 and cant digest it yet, then nothing on earth will ever do that. maybe you will have to experience the world in 20 years or so from now, and then you might be able to get what that film was trying to say. but it will be too late by then.

the movie was beautifully shot.. every scene was beautiful. the blue color expressing coldness (of feelings and weather). the weird clonned ice skaters.. we didn't see any single emotion or expressing of feelings from anyone but the 2 main characters, and Penn.

everyone here who didn't like the film was wondering what made this great talented cast join this film.

The dialogues-oh my- the dialogues are beyond words...

School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better lines!  It is truly sad...

The only positive aspect of the film is Claire Danes who under different circumstances (i.e. different role, different lines, different film) looks like she could have a promising future.

So it's a weak plot, and a good-but-wasted cast and setting, which when put together fail to take off.

I think it was just a critique on our media. It seems that we report on the most outrageous events in the world as if they happened every day. Moving on to the clones. First of all, the metal ID was obviously put there after they came, not as part of the process, but just so the family could differenciate betwen them. Secondly, the whole reason they did it was because they depended on her success to provide them with all the wealth they recieve, so since she was dying they needed to keep the cash cow alive. My last point, most importnatly: The whole people falling down dead and the weather being winter everywhere...IF YOU WATCHED IT, THEY EXPLAINED IT! They specifically explained that the weather on Earth is determined by our hearts. If we stop loving everything and make no room for real human emotions, then the weather gets just as cold. (point here to show that the current state of violent weather everywhere now equals our hostility to others). Since people are making no room in their hearts for real love, majorly out-numbering those who do love, their hearts are of no use to them, so they stop beating, and the people die. HENCE THE TITLE...ITS ALL ABOUT LOVE!! Also, the Sean Penn narration, he's writing about what is happening to the world and the reasons for it while searching for a place to crash the plane as everywhere is frozen.

The acting was superb in my opinion, and the movie was excellent.  But thats not why I'm giving 5 stars. I'm giving it 5 stars, because I read the other reviews here, and apparently this movie has really hit the right chord. The people who re looking for happy, fart humor comedies, hero always beats the world dramas, and death doesn't really exist tragedies...all gave this movie 1 star. All the people who appreciate film, know how to use their brains, and actually will sit still long enough to watch a whole movie all gave it 4 stars. Happy to see some David Lynch fans, and really Depressed that the spotlight review first is applicable to a veggie peeler, and second that the same guy would review both. Pick one! Veggies, Good Film. How can I trust your opinion of either when you write about them the same way? In the end, it's a matter of taste.

His ability to take any script (no matter, how bad) and create a memorable performance exceeds the abilities of most actors in his age range and beyond. I imagine some of the negative criticism of this film is based on the fact that the viewer has got to be engaged while watching this film.  It's All About Love, is not a movie that you can watch while cleaning the house or building a model airplane.  You have to 'watch' the movie or you will be lost.",1146614400,5,505,4.239583333333333
2348591,1,B000A0LEK0,"While its become clich to say, ""That is two hours of my life I can never get back!"", and I hate to be clich; this is EXACTLY what came to mind at the conclusion of the truly idiotic 'Its All About Love'.

A movie that seems bent on being odd just for the sake of it, this silly 2003 Sci Fi (sort of) from Director Thomas Vinterberg boasts some impressive Star Power.

Set in 2021, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who comes to New York City to sign his wife's and his divorce papers (apparently human kind has lost the knowledge of fax machine technology in the intervening years!); and winds up getting drawn into a twisted and convoluted plot to replicate and eventually murder his Polish ice-skating star spouse.

Said skating spouse is played by the talented Claire Danes; who, like Phoenix, is wasted in this confusing and nonsensical story. But an even greater waste of resources (and studio money!) is the presence in the film of Sean Penn; playing Phoenix's loving brother who, once afraid to fly and treated with ""an injection"", now can do nothing with his life EXCEPT fly around the globe, writing meaningless articles about the state of the world (for who?) at 30,000 feet. An ""interesting"" story device this, one that prevents Penn from ever appearing opposite his co-stars in a single scene; he literally phones in his performance. In every scene he appears in, his only  function is to leave rambling messages on brother-Phoenix's voice mail. Ah, what a fine place the world will be when we can at last use our cell phones while flying high above the Pacific Ocean!

I soon wondered why Penn was in this film at all, as his character was completely superfluous to the advancement of the plot. Still later, I realized the film really had no plot to advance; and that ALL of the talent herein was pretty much superfluous and wasted!

Add in snow in July and flying Ugandans (just when I thought it couldn't get any weirder, the movie introduces a sub-plot about village in Uganda experiencing a sudden loss of gravity; in which people have to tie themselves to the ground to keep from floating away!), and you have a film that begs the question: ""Did anybody read this script before signing on to this picture???"" This story seems crafted with the masterful hand of a Middle School creative writing student (emphasis on creative); though I doubt he or she would have received a passing grade if they turned in this script.

I give the pointless and silly `Its All About Love' a solid ""F"". While not the worst movie I have ever seen (that honor belongs to 2000's awful Japanese offering, ""Versus""), it's in the Top 10.  I watched at first bewildered, then stunned, and finally just laughing. It was so bad it was actually funny.

[spoiler ahead]

It seems clear that they must have been in some way cloned, and that the evil studio executives used their clones to act the parts.

On that note...one bit of hilarity re: the clones has to be small barcode thing on their arms. They are a miracle of modern science intended to dupe the world, yet there was no way to create them without plastering their arm with a relatively large metallic ID -- very nice.

Uggh. What a horrible film. The worst I've seen with a great cast since foolishly renting The Bridge of San Luis Rey. Never, ever rent this film.

2348603,5,B000A0LEK0,"It's All About Love has been criminally underrated. It's been called confused, convoluted, and pretentious. Well let's try another adjective: different. This is not the same kind of thing we've seen a million times before. In fact it seems to defy genre pigeon-holing.

Thomas Vinterberg, co-founder of the Dogma 95 moment towards ""purity"" in cinema made the excellent ""Festen"" and then took his craft to the other extreme with this futuristic fable. Set in a near future where the earth is on the brink of a new ice age the film tells the story of a Polish professor, John and his wife Elena plan to divorce. The couple have grown apart due to Elena's demanding schedule (she's a champion figure-skater) but when John arrives in New York to sign the final divorce papers, Elena begs him not to leave, confessing that she's in a danger that she doesn't completely understand.

The plot that follows is twisting and at times intentionally absurd: People drop dead in the streets due to a mysterious heart ailment, in mid-july it starts to snow all over the world, a man once afraid of flying overdoses on his medication and is now afriad to land, and as everything people think they understand is turned upside-down it's impossible to know who to trust.

But to view this film you have to put aside conventional notions of narrative structure or how a plot should unfold. Viewing this film is very much like participating in a dream. You have to go where it takes you- even if that's somewhere unusual.

Each shot in this movie is beautifully photographed channeling Hitchcock visually. Every thought in Joaquin Phoenix's head seems to appear on his face, while Claire Danes deftly channels a Hitchcock blonde. Alun Armstong and Sean Penn excel in smaller roles.

When I first saw this I wasn't sure if I liked it. But I found myself thinking about it a lot in the days following. On second viewing I think I understood it better. But it's not a film that's meant to be understood so much as experienced. I've ""understood"" it differently each time I've watched. I would recommend this film to anyone who is open to the experience.",1141776000,25,2129,4.743243243243243

So much in fact that it hardly made any sense.  I mean people dropping dead of broken hearts, the next ice age, clones of figure skaters, floating people in Africa, a random guy who is trapped on an airplane,it is just a little much.  When the movie finally ended all I could say was HUH?.  I don't know, maybe I am missing something, I just really don't want to have to sit through that movie again to find out.

It is one of those movies where you hold your breath the entire movie, holding out for that one scene where you finally understand what is going on. Unfortunately, I think that scene was left on the cutting room floor.

There are dead people that no one pays attention to, clone issues, unusual frosty weather, and flying people in Uganda. Looking back, this movie really is essentially a combination of the worst parts of 28 Days Later, Attack of the Clones, The Day After Tomorrow, and the floating scene in the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. So many elements, too little time. The result is about 4 possibly interesting plot lines. It was a shame none of them panned out to amount to much of anything.

The clones are barely on the screen at all, why the people are dying is more alluded to then precisely explained, the weather isn't really explained at all, and WTF is up with the floating Uganda people? If I missed any of the answers in the movie, it was because I was already asleep.

However, I often think about the movie plot. Perhaps the anger was that this movie is such an indictment of our world and cyber-culture today. We (humans)are definitely headed toward a disastrous near-future as depicted in this movie. The subplots of drastic climate changes; people dropping dead due to not having tactile relationships (a heart problem); the lack of reaction on the part of everyday people to dead bodies strewn in our paths; the chillingly cold response of a child coming across a dead body while the adult Nanny passively allows the unfeeling dictates of the child (next generation monster)and a superstar who is completely dominated by her circle of powerbrokers... they clone her in order to keep their high paying jobs (who-is-working-for whom?)... It's all actually happening. And just like anything else that happens in Africa; it's casually reported and mainly ignored.

I keep coming back to this movie in my head whenever I hear of a kid bullying another kid to death; the shooting of innocent people by passionless person; terrible storms and vast devastations in 3rd world countries while the rest of the world ignores and continues without a thought.

The lonely men and women looking for love but afraid to have an in-person relationship... It's all there. I get it.",1346198400,2,1438,5.03781512605042

It's a well-intentioned, probably highly flawed, film but you can't argue with the basic thought---that ""it's all about love.""

If you can suspend your rational mind for a while and just accept the beautiful people and the beautiful images, you might like the film a lot more than if you insist on it making good sense.

Both Joaquin Phoenix and Claire Danes give moving performances.  Some reviewers complain about their wavering accents but I thought they did a good job by going lightly on the accents.  Claire, especially, seemed to convey the sense of an Eastern European woman in a subtle but real way.  The cinematography is startling beautiful in places.  The quartet of the ""four Elena's"" on ice was hauntingly lovely.

8071781,2,B000A0LEK0,"The first word that comes to mind when thinking about 'It's All About Love' is ""surreal."" The next two are ""but pointless."" There are several scenes in the film that are striking and memorable. It's when I try to connect these dots that I run into trouble.

I've seen 'It's All About Love' billed as a science-fiction story, or as a thriller, and it is neither. To be frank, while it has many beautiful scenes and thoughtful moments, in the end I found it just falls apart under its own weight.

'It's All About Love' is not science fiction in the usual sense. It has many explorations in possible futures - people who literally die of heartbreak, a man who reverses his fear of flying to such a degree that he can no longer bear living while not flying, cloned celebrities, and people who are compelled to float off the surface of the planet are among them. But these ideas are all presented as simply disparate events, with no attempt at explanation or grounding. The movie struck me as more of an exploration into the fantastic than the scientific. Those looking for true science fiction should look elsewhere.

The film is plotted methodically, and may feel slow to many. Even so, it tends to lose track of where it's going and get distracted in long journeys of beautiful imagery - red splashes of blood on blue ice, snow in summer, floating bodies tethered to the earth. It's not a fast-paced thriller - it's a deliberate, methodical piece of art that takes its time to get to the point. Those looking for a solid, cohesive story should also look elsewhere.

The imagery is beautiful and surreal, and I give it credit here. There are some surreal films of this nature that I love - like the recent 'Moon' or Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's 'Mirrormask' or Darren Aronofsky's 'pi' or 'Solaris' (either version). But while those films share the strong imagery and methodical plotting of 'It's All About Love,' I came away from those other films feeling that they had a point. There was a definite conclusion, a definite story, a definite progression from point A to point B - and those movies also moved me, often deeply. Whether I felt wonder or disgust or fear or hope, the point is I felt something.

At the end of 'It's All About Love,' I felt...nothing.

This is a complex film, and an ambitious attempt at...something. In the end, 'It's All About Love' felt to me like a movie about not much of anything. And that's unfortunate.",1301529600,,2436,4.6013824884792625
