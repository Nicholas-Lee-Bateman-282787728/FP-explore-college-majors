2875781,4,B000RW5BZA,"This is a nice sampling of the better Cosby episodes.  I liked the show, but didn't want to purchase and watch entire season sets.  This set has most of the episodes that I remember from the series run.  Don't expect superb picture quality, but it looks at least as good as the original broadcasts.  There are no bonuses.  Episodes are in broadcast order.  For example, the first is from season 1, then you get one or two from each of the seasons that followed, in chronological order.",1195084800,45,485,4.517241379310345
2875782,5,B000RW5BZA,"I really love ""The Cosby Show."" Like millions of other families, every Thursday night when this came on, my family and I would get around the TV and watch it.

Why is ""The Cosby Show"" so groundbreaking?

It is really the first accurate depiction of an African-American family. Prior to ""The Cosby Show,"" African-American sitcoms always had the buffoon character with unrealistic storylines. But ""The Cosby Show"" refused to pander to the lowest common denominator. And by doing so they became the Number One Sitcom in the country. ""The Cosby Show"" said that the black family was no different from the white family or the Asian-American family or the Latin-American family. Maybe the main message of ""The Cosby Show"" was that in the end we all have the same problems and the same goals.

It's really hard to say who my favorite character is on ""The Cosby Show."" The entire cast is so likeable. Watching them was like watching old friends. If I had to pick, of course first would be Dr. Huxtable (played by the Cos, of course.) Because even when the kids did something wrong he was fair but very funny. And, coming in at a close second is Denise (Lilakoi Moon, more commonly known as Lisa Bonet.) Denise was always such a free spirit. And, of course I adored Mrs. Huxtable (Phylicia Rashd.) Didn't everyone wish they had a mom like her?",1190937600,27,1333,4.663829787234042
2875783,5,B000RW5BZA,"I bought this as a gift for my husband who is a huge Cosby Show fan. It's a pretty straight forward, no frills menu screen, but the DVD plays great with several classic episodes we enjoy!",1404604800,,187,4.222222222222222

2875785,4,B000RW5BZA,"Overall, good product, but the DVD doesn't always line up with the voices, and the picture seems to jump in places, like it has to catch up to what's going on.",1388361600,,159,4.161290322580645

2875793,5,B000RW5BZA,Decided to go out on a limb and order this for my kids (12 & 14) hoping they would enjoy The Cosby Show as much as I did growing up. This is in their regular rotation and is one of their new favorite DVDs!,1371600000,,205,3.6818181818181817
2875794,4,B000RW5BZA,"The Cosby show has spanned eight seasons and it's hard to get a collection that aptly and cohesively sums them up.  For the price, I'd say this particular DVD did a pretty good job.  The first half of the ten episodes covered more than the first half of Cosby's career, while the last few episodes seemed almost back to back, but they were still some of the funniest episodes I've seen (not to mention a couple of the most touching).

I was actually expecting a lot less quality, considering the meager packaging and the fact that this is not an ""official"" release, but I was pleasantly surprised.",1369180800,,597,4.5607476635514015
2875795,5,B000RW5BZA,"i always loved the cosby show.. especially in the world we live in today, it's hard to find comedy that's clean (no cursing, not talking about or making jokes about sex, and race all the time etc...) and the cosby show is a great show that's still good (even though it's old) that i can watch over and over with good clean comedy. so for that, i give it 5 stars.. :-)",1364428800,,367,4.111111111111111

2875800,5,B000RW5BZA,This product and all of the seasons are wholesome and at the same time very realistic and entertaining!  The acting is superb and in my opinion one of the greatest family shows of all time!

2875801,4,B000RW5BZA,"My family (and my husband's family) grew up on the Cosby show, so this was a treasure to find.  We laughed our way through these episodes when we were gathered together, first with my family, then with my husband's family.  I do think the earlier ones on this DVD tend to be more lighthearted/funny than the later ones, but they are all enjoyable.  In my opinion, this show was kind of the ""gold standard"" of family shows.  They don't make 'em like they used to!!",1345680000,3,463,4.411764705882353

2875805,4,B000RW5BZA,"I liked all the picked shows on the dvd. BUT they were missing a few. For one, the dvd is missing the show when Vanessa lied about her were abouts when she went to Baltimore,MD to see the 'Ratchess' and got stranded there. Two, when Vanessa got drunk with her friends from playing the alphabet game. And three, when all the men were pregnant. Those were the most memorable to me. So in my opinion they should have had more than 10 episodes. There were alot of good ones they missed.",1323648000,,482,4.3076923076923075

2875807,5,B000RW5BZA,"Reminds me of the good old days when our kids were home.  We never missed an episode and this DVD captures the best ones with remarkably good video for a pre-HD series. I liked it so well that I went back on Amazon and ordered copies for both of our sons. Since both of their wives come from other countries, neither of our daughters-in-law grew up with the Cosby Kids like their husbands did.  Should provide for some interesting cross-cultural discussions.",1313107200,2,458,4.6419753086419755

I actually have the whole series on the Cosby Show, starting with Season One. I still get numerous laughs from the show and am in the process of watching them all again. I think it was one of, if not the best, series ever!",1312329600,,391,6.39622641509434
2875809,4,B000RW5BZA,"I liked the condition that the product was delivered in, nothing was broken.  I appreciated the timeframe within which it was delivered and I enjoyed watching the best of the Cosby.",1306800000,,181,4.838709677419355
2875810,5,B000RW5BZA,"I don't think we ever missed a show during its long run.  The very first night it was on, my wife said ""I never heard you laugh like that"" and in deed it did hit me just right.  It of course is not all just funny a lot of the shows had a very serious side, isn't that life amoung all the seriousness of life there are those funny moments.

I am a big fan of old tv from ""The Honeymooners""  to ""The Cosby show"", in my opinion the only great show in the last 15 years or so has been ""Everybody loves Raymond"", I have the whole series on DVD and it was really expensive $40 a season, but worth it.

Since I got this ""Best of Cosby show"", I have seen each episode 3 or 4 times, I seem to be able to watch them over and over and they don't get old.

Having said that, much like the first ""Mary Tyler Moore"" I got that was a compilation, I bought the  whole series so that first one was kind of a waste and I gave  it away to a friend, I don't think she ever watched it.  I see that happening with this series, there is no way I am not going to get the whole run.

I have always been a Cosby fan, ever since I heard his first record when I was in College and I continue to appreciate his work, I thought he did a great job on ""Kids say the funniest things"", he really has a knack with children.

As much as I like the DVD, I would not recommend to someone that liked the show,  forget about the best of and go right for Season 1.

Thanks,
Barry",1303171200,9,1438,3.8175675675675675

The entire family sat around in our pj's and really enjoyed every episode. We all enjoyed the Cosby Show when it originally aired, but it seemed to be even better the second time.

2875813,4,B000RW5BZA,The Cosby show is a wonderment and having these ten great episodes is a joy.....wish more groups of the great episodes would be made....I love the show but cannot afford to buy the entire series..tho I would like to.  Come on somebody in Carsey/Werner distribution.....make a few more DVDs of the great episodes...!!!,1282953600,,317,4.981132075471698
2875814,4,B000RW5BZA,"While I appreciate that there are those fans who would like every episode of a certain series, others--like myself--just want our favorites.  These ten episodes are taken from the 1985-1990 seasons (when ""Cosby"" was the #1 show in the US).  I would have enjoyed seeing episodes from the closing seasons (the final episode would have been wonderful), but this was a fantastic concept.  I wish a lot more series would have a release like this DVD.",1275264000,,445,4.828947368421052
2875815,5,B000RW5BZA,"Even though the Cosby Show is around 20 years old, it's still one of the best sit-coms ever. Bill Cosby is hilarious - a comic genius. His reactions to events are so spontaneous and creative. I haven't seen another comic quite like him. Best of all, the show's plots are both family-friendly and funny. Unlike modern sit-coms, the characters don't curse and talk about sex every other scene. Rather the episodes are centered around family dramas that are realistic but always resolved well. The cast includes everybody from Phylicia Rashad as the tough and very intelligent Mrs. Huxtable, to the young and adorable Rudy. This makes the show accessible to a wide range of audiences. I am glad these finally came out on DVD. I hope one day to share this treasure with my children.",1263168000,,778,4.770370370370371

2875819,5,B000RW5BZA,"OMG!  I am so happy with this DVD Series.  I am still on Season One, because I watch some of the episodes a couple of times before moving on!  There are a couple of episodes that I forgot about because they have not played them on television since the original airing.  I had no idea there were so many episodes per season.  To watch the talent and development of all of the actors is amazing.  This show transcends age, gender, and race.  It is a good family show.",1231804800,2,465,4.215909090909091
