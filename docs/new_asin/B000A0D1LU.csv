Great Job Shelley Duvall",1378512000,,99,4.0
2344599,2,B000A0D1LU,The plot is.lame the.actors over act the story is boring by Disney. Headless horse man much better than this so.call. version of the classic tail,1357689600,,145,4.84

2344601,2,B000A0D1LU,"Part of the reason why I was disappointed with this, is my own fault. I used to watch this when I was younger, and thought it was amazing. Watching it now, as a nineteen year old... I realize I was naive. Apart from the less-than-stellar acting, the production itself is laughable. I could have filmed this on my digital camera and it would have looked better. The camera operator often shakes through the movie, and the sound is a bit off. I wouldn't recommend spending money on this!",1219968000,,485,4.5227272727272725
2344602,1,B000A0D1LU,"I bought this DVD based on the review from the other person who purchased it, and wish i hadn't. HUGE disappointment. The acting was awful and it wasn't entertaining at all. It also looked more like a play than a ""movie"". It could have been done so much better and still stayed true to the story. (we saw a local production of Sleepy Hollow and it was so great!)

At first, i was excited to find this so that i could watch it with my children (we love the Johnny Depp movie too, but it can be a bit gruesome). But not one of us enjoyed this movie at all. Very stupid, moronic and boring. (Even the Disney version is way better than this!)

I hate to even give it one star.",1130198400,,672,4.083333333333333
2344603,5,B000A0D1LU,"This is a wonderfully done show, that, unlike the movie ""Sleepy Hollow"", remains very loyal to Washington Irving's vision, when Mr Irving created and wrote the American Classic, ""The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow"".

 Well, there is a slight new twist at the end, but the Headless Horseman told me he'd have my head on a silver platter if I gave the ending away, so I am staying silent!

  Ichabod Crane, that poor, former schoolmaster of Sleepy Hollow wasn't so lucky however.

  Ichabod Crane, besides the Headless Horseman himself, is the most important character in the whole story, and because of this, whoever gets the role of Ichabod better do the role justice, or the story will suffer. Ed Begley Jr. does indeed do the Ichabod character justice...and then some!

  Begley jr. is fantastic as the superstitious schoolmaster of the Hollow, and the man truly looks scared of the ghostly going-on's in the sleepy little village where he teaches school and tries to capture the heart.....the most coveted heart in Sleepy Hollow....the heart that belongs to Katrina Van Tassel, the beautiful (and RICH!) Daughter of one of Sleepy Hollow's favorite sons, old Baltus Van Tassel, the richest and most influential man in all of Sleepy Hollow!

  Beverly D'Angelo does a spectacular job playing the role of Katrina.....she is a natural for the role!

  This classic, timeless, tale of love, greed and a certain headless ghost is not just a Halloween classic story. This story is great anytime of year!

  Shelley Duvall, the famous and talented actress, produced this classic version of the Legend, and it is easy to tell how passionate she is about the story, because she does a great job in telling it, and she does a fantastic job in staging the scene where the unfortunate Ichabod meets the Headless Horseman!

 The clatter of Horse's hooves echo in the still Sleepy Hollow night, as Ichabod, riding aboard the old, stubborn horse, ""Gunpowder"",(loaned to him by Hans Van Ripper),is chased by the Headless Horseman..... step for step, and stride for stride across the darkest forests that Sleepy Hollow has to offer.

  The scenes of the Headless Horseman chasing Ichabod through Sleepy Hollow while holding a glowing Pumpkin, will give any Sleepy Hollow fan, or anyone else for that matter, the chills!

  This story is even better, due to the ""Campfire story"" type of atmosphere that is given to it.

  The best thing about this story perhaps, is that the whole family can enjoy it. It isn't bloody and graphic like Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"".

  This version of Sleepy Hollow is much more consistent with Washington Irving's original idea, and I am sure that Mr Irving wanted it to be for the entire family.

  I must mention, just in case anyone is wondering, that this show isn't a new Sleepy Hollow show. It was made in the mid-late 80's, I believe. It originally aired on ""Showtime"" I think.

 The video has been available for a while, but this is the debut of the DVD version.

 I love the cover art....it really gives one a spooky, yet not too spooky feel....much like this show. It's spooky, but not TOO spooky, and thus older kids can probably watch it and enjoy it without parents having to worry about blood and gore. As far as I can remember, there is not one iota of blood or gore in this show. It is a family show, except for very young kids, who may be a bit frightened by the music and the screaming voice of Ichabod, which IS freaky and annoying after a while, thus giving credibility to the pathetic schoolmaster's unfortunate plight.

  Make some Pumpkin Pie, and a nice hot cup of Apple Cider with a stick of Cinammon in it, and curl up in your favorite seat....because TONIGHT, THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN RIDES!!!!!!!!!!!",1122076800,,3735,4.777777777777778

8071067,1,B000A0D1LU,Not good!  The script mangled Washington Irving's sketch (one of my favorites too) beyond belief.  Extremely irritated that I can't get my money back.  I'd like a refund so I can purchase something else for the Halloween season,1472688000,,227,4.921052631578948
