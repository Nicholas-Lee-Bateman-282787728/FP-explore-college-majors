1485953,5,B00005JMHI,"What is the problem, Universal? My God, there are so many LAME series that are now on DVD, why not put out one of the best action//drama/comedy shows EVER MADE? There are LITERALLY legions of fans that will buy this set as soon as it's released. COME ON!! And while you're at it, get Tom Selleck and the gang on the big screen for a Magnum, p.i. movie!",1062633600,41,352,4.1911764705882355
1485954,5,B00005JMHI,"I can't believe that they have some pretty recent and lame shows on DVD now, but not Magnum P.I.  This has to be one of the coolest shows from my youth, and I don't understand why they haven't put at least one of the seasons on DVD yet.  I'm sure I'm not alone in my demand for this to be on DVD.",1061769600,6,296,3.7580645161290325
1485955,5,B00005JMHI,"Tom Selleck and Thomas Magnum is one of the greatest, coolest characters created for television. The show kept things interesting for years and the sooner it comes out on DVD the better.",1059782400,6,186,4.84375
1485956,5,B00005JMHI,"I've been waiting for this for a long time.  Magnum, p.i. is the greatest TV series ever; a truly amazing and thoroughly enjoyable story.
I only hope that Season One... and all successive seasons will be released shortly.",1058400000,4,221,4.815789473684211
1485957,5,B00005JMHI,"Magnum, P.I. is one of the best TV series ever produced.  Gorgeous Tom Selleck played the lead character, tooling around Hawaii in a red Ferrari.  John Hillerman provided a wonderful contrast with his portrayal of Higgins, and Roger P. Moseley and Larry Manetti were terrific as Magnum's war buddies.  The series had excellent production values and really, really good scriptwriting.  The superb balance among mystery/suspense, drama and comedy has yet to be matched.
Selleck went on to a fairly successful movie career and recently returned to television in a recurring role on NBC's 'Friends'.  'Magnum' really showed off his acting versatility as well as his good looks and is the catalyst that led to all his later success.
I desperately want to own the entire series but refuse to purchase it on VHS, which (as we all know) fades and degrades in other ways both visual and sonic.  I would also love to see the release have special features including cast/crew interviews.  How about it, eh?  Let's get this baby out on DVD!",1058227200,69,1028,4.901734104046243
1485958,5,B00005JMHI,"This is one of my dream come true TV Series. Superstar Tom Selleck is THOMAS MAGNUM, a detective who is funny and hansom.
Joining Selleck are regulars John Hillerman (Higgins), Roger E. Mosley (TC) and Larry Manetti (Rick). Featuring non-stop action, mystery and romance, MAGNUM P.I. became one of the most popular shows of all time.",1057622400,8,333,4.964285714285714

1486223,5,B00005JMHI,Favorite tv show. It's just as great as I remember,1459036800,,50,4.1
1486224,4,B00005JMHI,"Just like this friendly character, a good guy P.I. who lives for the chase of a case, whether interesting or not, dangerous or challenging, the women, case situation variety, entrance (or otherwise) into exclusive homes, and exclusivity itself.  He's a sucker for, in particular, a pretty face, especially younger, a damsel in distress or simply needing help. (He's a tall looker himself). He aims to try his best to get success though when he doesn't, he blames himself. His expectations are always higher than what often turns out. He is always borrowing or owing money, especially from his two best friends from the Nam years. They never see the money, but take what he can give. All three are barely making it, but their loyalty to each other stands firm and they do what they do because they like it, and it feeds them. (The water, close to the estate, allows him to swim and keep in shape).
The character plays ""just an everyday guy"" who lives day by day, taking what he can of the good things his unexpected life, his career, brings him. His character portrayal is simple, honest (well, most of the time, anyway) with a great smile. He loves his red mustang, on loan from his famous, rich, writer boss, where he has a room at his Estate, on the big Island of Hawaii, as part security person and who he share's with Higgins, who is a bit of a prig, irascible at times, lives for his own fantasies about his past or imagined present importance, as manager
of this Estate.

For me, light story, fun plots, good action and enjoyable characters.",1457827200,2,1547,4.601449275362318

1486712,5,B00005JMHI,"magnum P.i.  is one of those classic shows that has pure coolness written all  over it.  Ive grown up watching this show..and let me tell you...it NEVER gets old...  lets just hope they don't remake this..because it wouldnt be the same..

You have great characters..like Thomas magnum,  Jonathan higgins (Higgy baby !)  Tom's war buddies T.C,  and Rick..as well as supporting characters like Ice Pick, mack, Lt tanaka,  luther Gillis ,,...all these characters are well written. and you actually care  what happens to them...

 theres great locals (hawaii) stunning sunsets...action, drama, beautiful women,  romance...  exciting storylines .. theres  Zuess  and apollo  plus, the Ferrari too :) hmm  did i mention the beautiful women?  lol  :)  magnum P.I has it all...

 plus, its also cool  when Thomas ""breaks the 4th wall"" and looks right into the camera...it makes you feel like your right there  plus the voice overs are done  as an homage to the 40s detective stories...

this show was the soul of the 80s...and it still rocks in the 21st century thanks to dvd..

1486934,5,B00005JMHI,Our whole family likes watching these old shows. Higgins is a hoot and how bout those legs on Thomas Magnum!,1390003200,,108,4.45
1486935,5,B00005JMHI,"I love the show, and the first season sets the tone perfectly. Watching Magnum PI never gets old; the only thing dated is the clothes. The setting is great, but it's the cast that carries the show, particularly its star, Tom Selleck. The first season establishes the group dynamic with Magnum, Rick, T.C., and Higgins. I must admit though; I didn't always get the contribution of Rick-his access to Icepick maybe? Tom Selleck was the greatest star of the 80s; I remember that he was always the correct answer to any game show question about male tv stars.

 Magnum PI broke television ground in addition to just being entertaining. There are references to Magnum's ""team"" in Vietnam throughout the series, and it was always positive. This portrayal of Vietnam vets may make sense now but in 1980, it wasn't always the norm. Beginning with the first episode, the two-parter, ""Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii, ""flashbacks to the team's Vietnam experiences are used as both plot and background on the characters.

 On a lighter note, the guest stars are great too. I especially liked some of the hotter female stars, particularly Erin Gray as J.""Digger"" Doyle. Also, the bonus episodes feature Morgan Fairchild and Sharon Stone from later seasons. This show's got it all: wit, suspense, sex-appeal, even history. Wouldn't we all love to live like Magnum?",1389657600,,1348,4.92511013215859

  I enjoy the fact that in these 80's episodes, you see Rick, TC and Higgins always light up a smoke, you don't see that much on tv's crap tv shows. Also, you see Magnum jump in the car and NEVER puts on his seat belt! Just little stuff like this I enjoy.

1487380,4,B00005JMHI,"Thomas Magnum (Tom Selleck) was one of the best of the flock of memorable TV detectives of the 1980's, and this is the first volume of his adventures.  When we first meet him in the two-hour pilot, ""Please Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii"" (yes, the title makes sense, but only after you've watched it), he's a 34-year-old private investigator (he hates to be called a ""private eye"") who served as a Navy SEAL in Vietnam (and is still occasionally troubled by dreams and flashbacks), then in the Naval Intelligence Agency at Pearl Harbor--two experiences that have made him cynical about most things official--before he ""beached himself"" a year ago.  Somehow he met Robin Masters, a famous and fantastically successful novelist with an estate on the island, and was offered free occupancy of its guesthouse in exchange for acting as backstop security for Sgt.-Maj. (Retired) Jonathan Quayle Higgins III (John Hillerman), the self-proclaimed ""major-domo""--actually a glorified caretaker--of the place.  Once there he contrived to also obtain use of Robin's red Ferrari, though he often has to wheel and deal with Higgins to keep it.  Though most of his off-camera cases seem to be low-paying divorce jobs--at one point we find out that he hasn't ""had $200 in his checking account since he left the service,"" though what he spends his money on isn't clear--he has his share of intriguing and dangerous ones, and these are the focus of the series.  In solving them he often calls on two former teammates from the war, T.C. (Roger E. Mosely), who has translated his experience as a chopper pilot to ownership of Island Hoppers, a tourist flying service, and Orville ""Rick"" Wright (Larry Manetti), a cocky, wiry, street-wise native of Flatbush, formerly T.C.'s door gunner, notable for his shady contacts and ability to find out almost anything; in the pilot he owned a disco, Rick's Club Americaine, but after the series was picked up he was made manager of the King Kamehaha Club, a private outfit on the beach where Magnum--as the permanent guest of Robin Masters, who's among the most prominent members--spends a lot of his time.

Like all the detective series of its era, MPI (as it was called by its fans) had to find something to make itself unique among a crowd of other such shows, and what it chose was the relationship between Magnum and Higgins.  Higgins, despite having been only a noncom, was clearly reared an aristocrat (in future seasons we learn that he attended Sandhurst, the British equivalent of West Point), and has a tendency to look down his nose at Magnum, whom he regards as a lazy, uncultured freeloader--which is unjust, because while Magnum does prefer to live in faded jeans and aloha shirts, he runs the eight-mile beach route from the estate to the Club every morning, swims, paddles a surf-ski, plays sand volleyball and (when he can con Higgins into letting him use the estate courts) tennis, looks quite dashing in a suit, is cool-headed in moments of peril and capable of fast, graceful action--it's a treat to watch him move.  Higgins also has what Magnum considers an annoying habit of launching into long tales of his army service during and after World War II at the drop of a hat (""This reminds me of...,"" he'll begin, and you never know whether the story will end up perilous or humorous), and flatly states that he doesn't ""like the way you live...[or] the way you drive [the Ferrari]...[or] your friends...""  He and Magnum are perpetually locked in conflict over the car, Magnum's use of the estate wine cellar/tennis courts/hot tub/big-screen TV, and Higgins's two Dobermans, Zeus and Apollo, who share their master's dislike of him.  Yet as the series proceeds, Higgins apparently finds Magnum growing on him: he once says that he's ""glad you're all right,"" and another time, after Magnum has agreed to move out in order to get Higgins's help in clearing T.C. of a smuggling rap, Higgins not only provides the help but ultimately maneuvers him into staying on.

Magnum is a slightly quirky, very attractive, soft-spoken but definitely masculine character who often provides voice-over narration that brings us up to speed on his thoughts on a situation or what's been going on when the camera wasn't looking.  The series exteriors were filmed on location in Hawaii, and some of the scenery--especially the sheer cliffs past which T.C.'s chopper sometimes flies--is incredible.  The set includes three double-sided discs and a single, containing all 18 first-season segments (including the pilot, aired as a two-parter), plus ""Kiis Don't Lie/Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend,"" the crossover with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simon-Simon-Season-Two/dp/B001JTRKHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simon & Simon: Season Two</a>&nbsp;(which isn't on the latter) and ""Echoes of the Mind,"" a two-part fifth-season episode featuring Sharon Stone, which is also available on the Fifth-Season set.",1349136000,4,4970,5.159006211180124

His name is Thomas Magnum, a former Lieutenant in the Navy and Vietnam veteran. Magnum is a private investigator. The main person in charge of security is Jonathan Quayle Higgins III, a Lord in the peerage and former World War II officer. On the estate are two guard dogs, Zeus and Apollo. They really don't like Magnum. Magnum's friends are T.C. and Rick, two fellow Vietnam veterans who get involved in Magnum's cases one way or another. You are cordially invited to make their acquaintance.

The first season includes all the episodes from the first season, including the II-part pilot episode, along with two bonus episodes (technically four, but I say two because they're really two II-part episodes; one is a crossover episode from season 3 of Magnum P.I. with Simon & Simon and the second is a special II-part drama from seasom 5 of Magnum P.I.). There are some sly references & homages to Casablanca, one of the greatest films ever made, along with more surprises.

1487479,5,B00005JMHI,"I love Magnum p.i. I grew up with this series as a little girl and sometimes I was unable to watch the show because at that time Vietnam and any portrayal on television was considered too violent. In my late 20's I use to run home from the beach and watch the reruns on TBS until I found out early in 2002, they were coming out with the DVDs. In actuality if the review would let me, I'd rate Magnum p.i. the entire series with 4.75 stars the reason being I felt or made an assumption that the original writer Donald P. Bellisario was unable to fully develop Vietnam in the character Thomas Magnum possibly because he hadn't fully resolved the war himself. So in turn I double-checked to see if he was in fact military and to my surprise he was an US Marine Sergeant. The show is magnificent and renegade as well as stifled. I also felt that Thomas Magnum's reasons for resigning his post in the military was more than what was expressed than his deflective statement, ""One day I grew up being 32 and realized I had never been 22."" In turn I am going to rate my favorites from the entire Seasons 1-8 here. However, my all time favorite that I'll include here is from Season 4: Home from the Sea. Loving and respecting the ocean myself, this story grabbed my heart and soul, which is my feelings about the show. Anyhow these are my favorites:

Season 1
Please Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii Part 1&2
The Ugliest Dog in Hawaii--the humor and sometimes unexpected bloopers in the credits will make one smile.
Skin Deep

Season 2
Memories are Forever Part 1&2 the ending
Texas Lightening a sheer double cross and a good conversation starter, ""The Hell of It,"" beginning with the concept of an existential reality.
Woman on the Beach This is one of the main reasons I liked the show for Magnum wasn't always trying to be a p.i. but his friends and life just so happened to get him involved without pay. ""When its right its right.""

Season 3
By Its Cover
Did You See the Sunrise?

Season 4
Home from the Sea the child Magnum is adorable

Season 5 Begins with a bang yet one can see the turning of the tide as they cross over with writers. As a result the show begins to lose her spirit even evident with the ""lads"" Zeus and Apollo. It is apparent that the writers as well as the cast who could have gone deeper were unable to develop their characters more fully. It also begins to downplay Vietnam in ""All for Us"" with resolving an unresolvable. It was too cliched for me. For one does not go from Memories are Forever and then have resolve when placed straight back into the Vietcong Jungle. Also I feel this was the sign of the time for America and Television with easy solutions and too difficult problems to contend with such as Mac's death. People do not like death hence his return as Jim Buffet. Magnum p.i. begins his return in Season 8 with ""Infinity and Jelly Donuts;"" however the network ended the series and took away a story and a man before many were ready to let go.

Season 6
Season six I am in a little area of charcoal. ""Deju Vu"" could have been a hell of a lot better if there had been a bit more fluidity of England and American ties regarding the unfinished war business; however censoring rules the day. Then there is the ""Kona Winds"" and I liked this one. Had the producers and director collaborated more with the previous seasons regarding Thomas Magnum's constant conundrums with women and developing his apparent vulnerabilities with women leaves the viewee dangling for more. My favorite so far with this season is ""Going Home."" I don't want to give away the story yet the drama resonates much with me with blended family, not coming home for years plus the gripping ending. It would have been an added touch had Rick, T.C. and Higgins been a part of Magnum's walk coupled with their own responses. Then there are some flops especially ""Summer School"" a stint with Robin Masters' nephew is just plain awful and so is ""Blood and Honor"" that could have been better with Thomas Magnum's military record. However ""Rapture""  whoowee, I haven't seen the likes of a TV episode similar to this before. Season 6 also include ""Little Girl Who,"" from Season 7, and one begins see the devious side of Magnum's ex-wife Michelle on multilevels.

You have a young Tom Selleck who is handsome, sexy, athletic, funny and all around entertaining.

1487484,5,B00005JMHI,"This first season of beloved Magnum P.I. does not get you off to a slow start, but rather as Magnum's Ferrari, starts you off into the series beginning at 60 mph in 4 seconds or less.  This season is not so much an introductory season as much as it starts you off in a deep dive.  The first season goes strong until the end & continues into the next seasons.  You don't miss a thing.

The theme song is different in the beginning, but soon enough you get eased into the beloved & popular theme song introduced into the episodes, & by the second disc, flip side, the episodes start off with the beloved theme song.

The fifth disc contains some bonus episides including one from season three (Ki's Don't Lie) with Morgan Fairchild & Simon & Simon.  The conclusion or continuation of this episode is in a bonus feature episode from Simon & Simon.  There is also a two episode feature (1984 original broadcast) from season 5 (Echoes of the Mind) with a beautiful, young & disturbed character (Diane Dupre') portrayed by Sharon Stone, with whom Magnum has fallen very much in love with . . .

What could be better than to start off with Season One!?!  Also with this series you can always watch the epidodes over & over because there is so much action & happenings & the characters are so full of personality that you can never get tired of watching the episodes again & again or really remember all the details to every episode.

A previous episode was further out of sync but I don't recall which. Sorry I'm not going through those discs to find out. I could live with it.

This may be my Sony HDMI NS75H DVD player, although I never had the problem with other discs.

The box has a sleeve that looks intended for a booklet but none was included nor advertised to be included.

Editorially, what a joy seeing the first season after all these years. Interesting to learn the classic opening theme first insinuated itself as the closing theme. I assume intense lobbying made them put the original theme to pasture. (Ever hear the original ""The Prisoner"" theme? Egad! Insert Higgins-ism here.)

And I am disappointed to hear previous reviews make comparisons to the excellent Lovejoy! I thought that connection belonged to my brilliant mind alone. I remember having that revelation but thinking nothing of it until I saw Ian McShane guest starring in at least two Magnums, one included here. For once a series idea went across the pond the other direction.

1487645,5,B00005JMHI,"The first season of Magnum has so many treasures, even how on my television how old and grainy the picture looks during early eps/openings, like when the plane is flying in in the first episode. Brings back alot of memories really.

My favorite parts of the eps (besides the pairs of ""Stews"" that seem to be in alot of the early eps staying at the estate), is the relationship between Higgins and Magnum. There's in early eps how a thug refers to Higgins as ""Braduh"" to which Higgins' reply is ""I'm not your brother"" or something along those lines, so you get a glimpse of Hawaiian lingo back in the day.  Also T.C. and Rick getting dragged into each case, Rick is more of a in the know type person who can track down leads, but T.C. is always lamenting being involved in Magnum's crazy cases. Then there is Magnum's ever expanding tab at Rick's place too.

I get involved with the early history of the show, how the plates changed from ep 1 to ep 2 on the Ferrari, and when Magnum first starting wearing the Detroit Tigers cap. Robin Masters private phone number is in there, along with the number to the bedroom at the guest house as you watch them push the numbers (I just geek out and pause and play it over to write it down). There's also Rick's real name which I thought might be difficult to catch, but early on they do mention it 3 or 4 times, so it's not that difficult to obtain.

So many great eps in season one, getting to know the ""lads"" in Higgins' Doberman's Zeus and Apollo, and all of Higgins (loved the little girls calling him ""Huggins"" throughout one Christmas ep btw), all of his nuances and seeing him laugh out loud as well as scowl is just priceless really.

Great introduction to the series which began in December 1980, nice scenery, and you get to see the seedy nightlife of downtown along with the beaches and pretty girls of course. Alot of humour and suspense, nice scenery adds up to an entertaining series throughout, and season one is a great place to start to see how it all began.",1222646400,5,2015,4.39142091152815

The ensemble cast each bring a well-developed character to the screen from episode 1.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching the episodes in order and fully intend to buy the rest of the seasons.  I would have given this 4 1/2 stars if possible.  The only ding is that the transfer quality was poor in places.  This series definitely merits remastering.  I had hoped that this would be done for the DVD, having noticed that this poor resolution occurs occasionally in the re-runs broadcast on television as well.

1487651,5,B00005JMHI,"Finally, MAGNUM's abbreviated 1980-81 Season was put on DVD with each and every episode complete and uncut like it originally was during MAGNUM, P.I.'s whole 8-year run on CBS with the exception of each episode on this DVD being commercial-free, which is wonderful and even better than having to worry and wait about all the commercials we'd have to watch in between even on CBS, plus all these episodes of MAGNUM on COZI-TV, WGN, USA, and A&E don't even compare to how they're all shown on this DVD, since every episode had too many deleted scenes with too many commercials added in between to allot for time whenever MAGNUM, PI was shown in reruns on on both cable TV and syndication.

In addition, each episode of this detective drama also includes a brief summary along with it's original air-date of this 1980-1981 Season of MAGNUM on CBS and includes closed captioning on them too, but it's just too bad they couldn't make MAGNUM's 6th, 7th, and 8th Season DVD box set like this one, because it would've made them even better.

For instance, the original air-dates to each of this seasons episodes are
12/11/80-DON'T EAT THE SNOW IN HAWAII(a.k.a. The Pilot Episode)
12/18/80-CHINA DOLL
12/25/80-THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS & BIG ONES TOO
1/8/81-NO NEED TO KNOW
1/15/81-SKIN DEEP
1/22/81-NEVER AGAIN, NEVER AGAIN
1/29/81-THE UGLIEST DOG IN HAWAII
2/5/81-MISSING IN ACTION
2/12/81-LEST WE FORGET

2/26/81-THICKER THAN BLOOD
3/12/81-ALL ROADS LEAD TO FLOYD
3/19/81-ADELAIDE
3/26/81-DON'T SAY GOODBYE
4/2/81-THE BLACK ORCHID
4/9/81-J. ""DIGGER"" DOYLE
4/16/81-BEAUTY KNOWS NO PAIN

Additionally, the First Season shows us how the former Navy Intelligence officer & Vietnam veteran now turned private investigator Thomas Magnum(Tom Selleck)got started along with his love/hate relationship with his Navy buddies from the Vietnam War T.C.(Roger Mosley) and Rick ""Orville"" Wright(Larry Manetti), along with the often exasperated British butler Jonathan Higgins(John Hillerman)and the dogs(Zeus & Apollo)and explains the estragned relationship and situation that Magnum and Higgins had with the so-called famous Robin Masters even though Robin was never shown on the series, even though the snazzy red Ferrari Magnum always drove was Robin's, which even said ""Robin 1"" on the license plate throughout MAGNUM's whole 1980-88 run on CBS.

This 1980-81 Season was also one of the funniest seasons of this private detective drama as well and was my second favorite season of MAGNUM, P.I. as well as the season that made Magnum(Tom Selleck)the sexiest & most charming detective on TV back then, especially in the early 1980's along with the fact that MAGNUM was in its honeymoon phase of the show during this season too despite the fact that this was only half a season.

This is also the season that made Tom Selleck a superstar and a sex symbol along with the fact that MAGNUM, PI came out a year later from playing his role as fellow gumshoe(Lance White) on the detective drama THE ROCKFORD FILES, which was an inspiration to MAGNUM, P.I., but it just so happens that MAGNUM had made its debut on CBS 11 months after NBC had abruptly cancelled the ROCKFORD FILES in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner's back & knee problems.

Additionally; it was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Gretchen Corbett in ""The Curse Of The Kamehumeau Club"" episode after her co-starring days as Rockford's sexy attorney girlfriend(Beth Davenport) in the first 4 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES which was of course before Corbett left Rockford in the Winter of 1978 due to a salary dispute.

*Rebecca Holden in the ""Missing In Action"" episode before her co-starring days as KITT's technician(April Curtis) on KNIGHT RIDER in its 2nd Season

*Erin Gray in the ""J. Digger Doyle"" episode before her co-starring days as Kate Summers on SILVER SPOONS and during her co-starring days as Buck's foxy sidekick(Col. Wilma Deering)on BUCK ROGERS

*Lance LeGault in the ""Missing In Action"" episode before his co-starring days as the hard-nosed Army nemesis(Col. Decker)on THE A-TEAM and before his co-starring days as Magnum's hellbent Navy nemesis(Col. Green) on MAGNUM

*Noah Beery, Jr. in the ""All Roads Lead To Floyd"" episode after his co-starring days as Rockford's retired long suffering truckdriving father(Joseph ""Rocky"" Rockford) on the ROCKFORD FILES

*Ted Danson in the ""Don't Say Goodbye"" episode before his co-starring days as Sam Malone on CHEERS and before his co-starring days on BECKER

*Judy Chapman in ""The Black Orchid"" episode before her co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Laurie Hendler in the ""Thank Heaven For Little Girls & Big Ones Too"" episode before her co-starring days on GIMME A BREAK

*Anne Lockhart in the ""Lest We Forget"" episode after her co-starring days as Lt. Sheba on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

*Edward Grover in the ""No Need To Know"" episode after his co-starring days on the short-lived NBC series SUPERTRAIN in the Winter of 1979.

The 1980-1981 Season of MAGNUM, P.I. was also the season that became almost a spin-off of HAWAII 5-0 and the ROCKFORD FILES.

This season takes me all the way back to memory lane to the recession we had going on back in 1981-1982 when we had all those budget cuts going on during Ronald Reagan's presidency after winning the presidential election in November of 1980.

So now that Universal has all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, PI out on DVD, I can hardly wait till Warner Bros. finally puts the detective drama MATT HOUSTON out on DVD, since I liked that show too along with the fact that MATT HOUSTON was a very popular private detective show in competition with MAGNUM during MATT HOUSTON's 1982-85 run on CBS's rival network(ABC), not to mention the intriguing slight resemblence between Magnum(Tom Selleck)and Houston(Lee Horseley), except Houston was a lot more fortunate, a lot tougher, a lot huskier, and a lot spunkier than Magnum ever was along with the fact that Magnum was always broke and Houston never was since Magnum was just a Hawaiian beach-bum private investigator who lived rent-free on a rich man's estate in Oahu, Hawaii; but Houston was a filthy-rich Texas style private investigator & former Vietnam Vet who lived high on the hog in a swanky penthouse in Hollywood & had a detective agency in Downtown LA that only did detective work on the side as a hobby & would often pay people money in $100 bills to get information to get leads & solve his cases along with the fact that Houston was like the Rolls-Royce in private detective shows who always wore spiffy 3-piece suits as opposed to Magnum usually wore more casual clothes like Hawaiian shirts, blue jeans, shorts, & often wore a Detroit Tigers cap.

Therefore you could say that MATT HOUSTON was like a rich-mans MAGNUM since Houston outclassed Magnum in many ways since Magnum couldn't even touch Houston, especially since Houston lived the kind of lifestyle that Magnum would've envied and wanted for himself, but unfortunately MATT HOUSTON tanked after its 3-year run on ABC since MATT HOUSTON took a nose-dive in the ratings since it started losing a lot of viewers thru MIAMI VICE when it debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1984 resulting in MATT HOUSTON's cancellation in the Summer of 1985 when MAGNUM's 6th Season was underway on CBS which simply goes to show you that sometimes old things and old ways are better than newer ones, which is probably another reason why MAGNUM, P.I. outlasted MATT HOUSTON which also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when both MAGNUM and MATT HOUSTON used to be on KTLA every Monday thru Friday at one time back in the early Fall of 1987 kicking off with MATT HOUSTON at 5PM followed by MAGNUM, PI at 6PM.

As a matter of fact, people used to tease Lee Horsley(Houston)a lot by asking him if he was trying to copy Tom Selleck(Magnum), but Horsley would always answer ""No, but I'm flattered you see a resemblence"" although Horsley knew people were just trying to hassle him, but Horsley would never take it personally because MATT HOUSTON was a very popular TV show just like MAGNUM was, despite the fact that MAGNUM lasted 5 times longer than MATT HOUSTON did and unlike Tom Selleck, Lee Horsley was never a sex symbol either.

Fortunately Paramount will be releasing MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 out on DVD on March 9th, 2010 and is available for pre-order, which is wonderful news for all you MATT HOUSTON fans out there.

In the meantime, I hope Universal re-releases this MAGNUM, PI-Season 1 DVD box set on single-sided discs to avoid all the skipping & freezing that I keep getting on these double-sided discs on this box set, especially on the ""Missing In Action"" episode along with the freezing & skipping I kept getting on KNIGHT RIDER-Seasons 1, 2, and 4; MAGNUM, P.I.-Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4; A-TEAM-Seasons 2 and 4, MIAMI VICE-Seasons 1, 2, and 3; etc.; which is why Universal now only makes their DVD's on 1-sided discs only like MAGNUM, PI-Seasons 6, 7, and 8 instead of putting them on 2-sided discs like MAGNUM'S first 4 seasons including this one, but I would hate to have to purchase the MAGNUM, PI-The Complete Series box set to be able to watch this 1980-1981 Season on Single-sided discs instead along with MAGNUM'S first 4 Seasons of course.",1201046400,2,9284,4.926423544465771

I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is.  I would recommend this to women even if you are not a Tom Selleck fan.

I even catch myself watching one of the extremely rare episodes that the previous reviewer described as ""stinkers.""

If you have never watched an episode of Magnum PI, you're missing out on a TV series that's both interesting and a lot of fun.

1487982,5,B00005JMHI,"As much as I loved the series during its original run, I wasn't sure I should watch it again on DVD. What if it seemed cheesy or hackneyed? Well, I was wrong. Magnum has aged far better than its contemporaries.

I won't dive into the details, because a lot of the other reviews have done this well. I'll just say that the rapport/rivalry between Magnum (Selleck) and Higgins (John Hillerman) is priceless. The acting outclasses any other show of that era. While some of the guest star performance seem really dated, the core characters are some of the best ever to appear in a popular TV show. The friendships and banter work as well now as they did.

Apart from short shorts, phone booths, no Internet and a lot of ugly early 1980's cars (except for one ;-), the series has survived its resurrection in fine shape.

The low point of the first season DVD collection is the Simon & Simon crossover episode, which shows how cliche the whole private investigator genre had become. Watching Jameson Parker try to impersonate a surfer is just painful, and you realize that the chemistry (setting and characters) in the Magnum PI series set it apart from the others.

Oh - and the Ferrari is still amazing after 25 years.",1115078400,8,1215,4.611111111111111
1487983,5,B00005JMHI,"One of the top rated shows on the 1980s decade, Magnum, P.I. thrilled audiences with its exotic setting and fast-paced action. Winner of multiple Emmys and Golden Globes, the show was a mainstay in the Top 20 Nielsen Ratings. Its Vietnam flashbacks (exploring the combat experiences of the main characters) were widely lauded, and Magnum, P.I. is considered the first television series to give recognition to the obstacles faced by Vietnam Veterans reentering American society. The range of topics, combined with a clever wit and heightened suspense, make Magnum, P.I. one of the more widely appealing TV series of its era...

Magnum, P.I. covers the life of Thomas Magnum (Tom Selleck), a former Naval Intelligence officer who resigns his position in order to set up his own private investigation business in Oahu, Hawaii. Through either luck or acquaintance, he lands a job as head of security for bestselling author Robin Masters' luxurious beachfront estate. This enables Magnum to drive around in Masters' sporty flame-red Ferrari, make use of various high-tech toys, and live a life of relative ease in the estate's guest house. But Magnum constantly butts heads with estate manager Jonathan Higgins (John Hillerman), a former British military man in his own right, and one with a strict penchant for order and discipline. Despite their conflicts, Magnum and Higgins maintain a healthy friendship, while Magnum's friends Rick Wright (Larry Manetti) and T.C. Calvin (Roger E. Mosley) are forever being drawn into Magnum's dangerous investigations...

The Magnum, P.I. (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii"" in which Magnum learns of the death of his childhood friend and Navy buddy Dan Cook. Skeptical of the officially cited cause of death, Magnum launches an investigation of his own with the aid of Dan's sister Alice. Eventually, the trail leads to an old military friend from Vietnam who might possibly be involved in a smuggling operation. Meanwhile, Magnum and Alice put their own lives on the line as they discover that someone is determined to put an end to their investigation... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""No Need to Know"" in which Magnum is hired to protect one of Higgins' friends from IRA assassins, and ""Lest We Forget"" in which a veteran of Pearl Harbor turned (Supreme Court Nominee) hires Magnum to investigate when he receives blackmail threats relating to his past...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Magnum, P.I. (Season 1) DVD:

Episode 1 (Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii: Part 1)

Episode 2 (Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii: Part 2)

Episode 3 (China Doll)

1488031,5,B00005JMHI,"If you drew even a single breath between the years of 1980 and 1988, you know this show. You might not know you know it, but Magnum is part of your soul.

What's great is that once you go out and buy this set, you'll realize that it's a bigger piece of your soul than you'd thought. I'm wiling to bet that even the crappy theme song that was used for the first half of this season rings a bell. You can't think of it now -- you CAN remember the brash, catchy, action/adventure theme song that was adopted after the first few episodes -- but you'll remember that old song and say, ""Oh, yeah. I never knew this was the original Magnum theme.""

And then the episodes start. From the very first minute of the pilot, you get to see why this was one of the top-rated TV show of the eighties. There are car chases, Vietnam flashbacks, competent mysteries, astoundingly good comedy, sexy stewardesses, gravitas, suspense, drama, exotic locations, and remarkable consistency.

What's crazy is how quickly the show hit its stride. This set contains a couple crossover episodes and specials from later seasons, and -- aside from the opening credits -- it's very tough to tell the difference between those and the first-season episodes on the discs. The cast and crew went into the show with confidence, and a pretty clear idea of what they hoped to accomplish. So the writing is great right off the bat. The cast jelled instantly; even though their characters weren't fully fleshed-out, they played like actual people. (It kind of makes you realize how often other TV shows -- and movies -- are filled entirely with stock characters, stereotypes and cardboard cutouts.) Larry Minetti as Rick is particularly grand as the proprietor of an eighties club, and the stellar John Hillerman nearly steals every scene as the overbearingly British Retired Sergeant Major Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

But let's have a word on the subject of Tom Selleck. This is the guy who was originally cast as Indiana Jones, but had to bow out because Raiders of the Lost Ark was scheduled to begin shooting at the same time as Magnum's first season. Did he make the right decision? It's tough to say whether Thomas Magnum is a better or worse character than Indiana Jones, but it's obvious that there wasn't a bad choice to be made there. He's absolutely delightful as Magnum, though, so let's just say that he made the right call.

To quote Magnum, ""I woke up one day, age 33, and realized I'd never been 23."" Arrested adolescence found the perfect actor in Tom Selleck, it seems. He plays the part of Magnum perfectly, but more than that, he anchors and holds together the cast and carries the stories quite ably.

Overlook the bad wardrobe and hair that clamor for screen space. This was 1980, and frankly, the hairstyles seen here were remarkably tasteful for that year. Not timeless by any stretch of the imagination, but tasteful.

Very first spoken line of the series: As two Dobermans are charging and Magnum is trying to pick the lock on a chain-link fence... ""Don't look at the dogs. Work the lock,"" Magnum tells himself. ""Work the lock. Don't look at the dogs. You looked at the dogs!"" So good.",1113696000,52,3169,4.668458781362007
1488032,5,B00005JMHI,"It is great to see Magnum again and all of the first season episodes are captured on dvd with excellent quality.

I had forgotten what the original theme sound sounded like, and it was nice to hear it again. There are no major extras except for 2 additional episodes to season 1.

Both episodes are from later seasons-the first episode is the one with Simon & Simon as a crossover episode, and the 2nd episode is the famous 2 part episode with Sharon Stone.

All in all, though, I believe that it is a worthwhile purchase

and seeing Magnum, Rick, T.C., and Higgins in DVD quality brought back a lot of memories.",1110067200,4,612,4.4375
1488033,5,B00005JMHI,"Of all the TV shows I loved in my early childhood, only Magnum P.I.  still enthralls me after all these years.  Sure the cases are pretty easy to figure out and the clothes and hair are a little dated, but those are the only drawbacks, if you can call them that.  I see them as historical references.

This show is Tom Selleck in his prime, and what a prime it was.  The writers were smart enough to include scenes of Magnum swimming in the tidal pool of Robin Masters' estate in every episode.  This means plenty of eye candy for those of us who still swoon over Selleck's long muscular body.  But Magnum isn't just a pretty face (with adorable dimples), he's a real sweet, charming guy who can always get the girl and the bad guy.

The scenery is fantastic, but one would expect that of a series set on Oahu, Hawai'i.  The supporting characters are just as great as you remember.  Higgins' uptight britishness is a fantastic foil to Magnum's easygoing personality.  T.C. and Rick are hilarious as Magnum's war buddies who seem to always be willing to lend Magnum a hand with his many cases, despite his inability to pay them back.

My only wish is that the producers of this DVD set would have included some kind extra features like interviews with the cast and production staff.  Maybe we can expect that with the release of the second season.",1109289600,10,1346,4.489711934156379
1488034,3,B00005JMHI,"Right from the beginning, as evidenced in this Season 1 DVD package, Magnum P.I. was a magical mix of action, humour, and high drama that kept people tuning in from week to week.  There were a number of dangers to the show in the first season - the Hawaiian locale, the Ferrari, the Vietnam tie-ins - that could have led it into a morass of gimmicky plots designed to highlight car chases, girls in bikinis, and post-traumatic 'Nam flashbacks.  All these things are in the show, of course, but they are seamlessly incorporated into the fabric of the show, so they almost never stand out as gimmicks, but are legitimate plot points and atmosphere.

I say ""almost never"" because the first season tends to be somewhat uneven.  There are some great shows, and there are some terrible shows.  There are some great guest stars, and some cringe-inducing performances (of the latter, the most distressing is a young Ted Danson who ended up as such a reliable TV actor on Cheers).  The low point in the season is the show ""The Ugliest Dog in Hawaii,"" wherein the eponymous dog is somewhat ugly, but not nearly as ugly as the performances from all but the regular cast.

Of course, the star + ensemble format was the standard casting method of the time, and it works to perfection here.  The actors all settle quickly into their roles (T.C. is a crass chauvenist in the first 2 or 3 episodes, but quickly evolves into the form he stays in for the rest of the series - we even see his volunteer work with local kids in a few episodes).  Their performances are pitch-perfect for the tone of the show, which can quickly alternate from slapstick humour to high drama in seconds.  This latter is another characteristic of the show that is evident early on - humour-based episodes do dominate the first season, but we also have some more serious plots.

Although the ""extended universe"" has not filled out yet (there's no Agatha, Michele, or Icepick in the first season, although Mac appears in a couple episodes), most episodes are immediately recognisable as Magnum shows, which speaks for the consistent quality of the performances of the regulars.  Too bad there are so many bad guest-star performances (and some weak scripts) in this first season.  I was also dissappointed by the lack of extras.  Most welcome is the inclusion of the cross-over Simon and Simon episode that goes with one 3rd-season Magnum episode.  However, one has to ask the question, ""Why isn't this on the Season 3 DVD?""  Other than that, there are no extras - no behind the scene stuff, no commentaries, no nothing!  The show is worth having on DVD if only to watch uncut and without advertisements, but Season 1 is certainly not the highlight of the series.  I'm anxiously awaiting the later seasons.

An interesting note: is there any '80's show with a more distinctive theme than Magnum's?  That is more immediately associated with the show?  And yet, for half of the first season, it had a different theme song!",1107648000,20,2977,4.7084942084942085

If you're a real die hard Magnum fan like me you'll enjoy this 4 DVD set.  The Bonus set is even great.  Having the Simon and Simon cross over and plus seeing the Sharon Stone Double Feature was cool too!

My other favorite part was the pilot episode ""Please Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii"".  I liked this because Tom was running a security check at Robin's Nest and the dogs were coming after him and he kept saying ""Don't look at the dogs, pick the lock"" and he turned and looked at the dogs and he said, ""you looked at the dogs"".  Then the other part was when he finally by passed the alarm on the Ferrari he looked into the camera smiled and raised his eyebrows!  LOVE THAT PART! :-)",1106956800,5,842,4.180124223602484

1488038,5,B00005JMHI,"Often times new TV series start out a little weak and eventually pick up steam. I'd say this was the case with shows like the X-Files, Star Trek TNG, and even Seinfeld. Magnum PI started out strong from the very beginning and stayed strong throughout most of the life of the series.

Even the first episode draws upon Magnum's ties to Vietnam, a theme that was continued throughout the series and made the show fascinating. Magnum's buddies Rick and TC are there from the start, as is the love/hate relationship between the three of them. And of course there is Higgins, Magnum's arch-rival and delightful comic relief.

This show is an absolute delight to watch. I thought after growing up with it as a teenager it might have lost some of its luster in the 21st century, but I was pleasantly surprised to see it had not. It holds up incredibly well even by today's standards, and remains, in my opinion, the best PI TV series ever made.",1106265600,8,937,4.571428571428571

The thing that keeps hitting us is that it was made in the 80's...who would have guessed that from the great plotlines and acting from all of the characters?!  When compared to many of the 1980's shows (i.e. Knight Rider), ""Magnum, P.I."" is in a class by itself.  It could be on TV today and would still have a HUGE audience.

We both watched the show when it first came out on TV, but we have found it all the more enjoyable now...especially compared to all the lame shows that are on TV these days.  Our nightly discussions go something like this, ""Wanna watch some TV?""  ""Sure...let's pop 'Magnum, P.I.' into the DVD player!""  Our only problem is that we have had to ration our watching because we're down to the last three episodes...and those are from seasons 3 and 5, and one ""Simon and Simon"" episode! :-)

1488130,4,B00005JMHI,"I was only a casual fan of the show when it originally aired.  If I was able to catch an episode that was great, if I missed an episode it was no big deal.  However, I find there are very few shows that I like that are produced today and so when I found they were releasing MAGNUM P.I.-season one I made sure I obtained a copy.  Compared to shows in production today M-P.I. is like a breath of fresh air.  Seaon one really sets up the background relationship for the 4 main cast members.  It has an almost perfect blend of mystery, humor and action.  I can see why it ran for eight years.

As for the DVD packaging, it seems to have what is turning out to be the standard Universal packaging for the television shows they release in season format.  The menu seems almost identical to the one used for KNIGHT RIDER-season 1.  The disks are double-sided.  I guess I'm lucky, I didn't have any problems with the playback of DVD's.  I've purchased other universal disks that freeze up and had to exchange them for another set but this time I lucked out.  As other reviewers mentioned not all the shows seem to have been cleaned up that well but they are still better than what is aired on television.  This DVD package deserved a few commentary tracks and a documentary.  I did enjoy the SIMON & SIMON crossover episodes and the Sharon Stone episodes.  However, it made me wonder if the studio included them with season one because they did not have plans to release all the seasons for M-P.I.

I hope all seasons are released.

I really love that they bring back the original opening credits with the original music and previews.  I had forgotten about the old opening music, but instantly remembered it.

My only complaints are the tabs on the packaging, as others have stated, plus I did have one episode that was skipping and another that the voices did not match up with the lips.  However, I am not positive this was the DVD.  It might have been my DVD player.

Brian Grazer is making a huge mistake.

I immediately put back my other newly released DVD selections so I could take this bad boy home with me. I wasn't disappointed. This series brings back so many memories from when I was a kid and starts off with some really great episodes that took me down amnesia lane. The Simon and Simon cross-overs are a nice addition, as are the Sharon Stone episodes from Season 5 (albiet very dark). I do wish there were some commentary from the cast to go with the episodes, or bloopers, or behind the scenes stuff (hence 4/5 stars) but overall, I have no complaints and am glad to have it.

1488138,5,B00005JMHI,"I've been reading a lot of reviews about the dissatisfaction with this DVD set and after finally purchasing this set, I can honestly say that my fears were swept away.

I grew up watching this classic TV show when it was originally broadcasted on network TV. From the very familiar theme song to Magnum's mysterious charm I'm glad I caved in and bought this set.

While it's true that there were a lack of features, I didn't buy this set for them. Just to be able to sit down and watch these classic season one episodes brought a new sense of adoration to this show. I hadn't thought about buying this set but now I'm glad I did.

This set, apart from the 18 episodes from season one, which also includes the 2-part series pilot episode, includes a bonus DVD which includes the two-part cross-over episode with Simono and Simon (another classic series) as well as the part episode from Magnumn's fifth season starring Sharon Stone.

All in all, this is a very excellent DVD set to own and every fan needs to own this DVD set.

One final note: The DVD set I bought? I had no problem with the pop-up tabs breaking. As long as you're careful with retrieving the DVD's from the slipcase slots they won't break. They're just a manufacturing defect.",1100390400,9,1243,4.506666666666667

Yes, there is a lack of special features, like other sets.  Most notably a lack of the ""artist's"" commentary.  Each episode does have its own ""menu"" with the original airdate listed and a short synopsis.

No, there is no booklet or documentation included.

No, you will not miss that.

What you WILL enjoy, are the ORIGINAL ""opening trailer"" sequences and title montages which are beautifully intact, despite the fact that the title sequences in the first season continously evolved from episode to episode back in the day.  Ending credits are also intact showing choice snipets from that episode (sometimes with hilarious effect).  When I saw them in the early eighties for the first time, I thought every show should duplicate this technique.  If you have ever attempted to watch the series on cable reruns, you will see that the title sequence has been made ""generic"" and/or standardized no matter the episode or season.  Forget about the ending credit sequences, since those are usually overtaken by the station's advertising.  It may seem unimportant to most, but to diehard fans it's little features like that make shelling out $40 worth it.",1098230400,23,1257,4.9052132701421804

The whole package is really nice and impressive, and they have really put in an effort to catch the ""-80s atmosphere"", which they succeed with. The price is also very reasonable considering you get all together 26 full-length episodes ($1.60 per episode).

You get all the 22 episodes from the first season, and then you get both the episodes from the Simon & Simon crossover and a double episode from Season 5 starring Sharon Stone. The interesting with the first season of MPI, and most other TV shows, is that you see how the characters develop during the season.

I can definitively recommend this package to anyone who appreciate the coolest TV show of the -80s.

1488249,4,B00005JMHI,"A quarter-century after its debut, MAGNUM, P.I. has finally been reborn on DVD. This collection features the eighteen first season episodes (including the two-part intro show) and four additional episodes, the SIMON AND SIMON crossovers and two episodes starring Sharon Stone. It's an around the clock Magnum fest, with enough papaya and poi to satisfy anyone (except us HAWAII FIVE-0 fans who are still waiting for that classic to be released).

Tom Selleck is charming and roguish, Higgins is insufferable and witty, the writing is creative and never by rote, and the locations are incredible. Even at the full price this set is worth having.

Widely considered never to have ""jumped the shark,"" MAGNUM P.I. holds up well after all these years.

The only drawback to this set is he double-sided DVDs,a cost-cutting factor which risks some damage to the discs, and the cheap DVD pop-out buttons. When I opened my set, one disc fell to the floor and rolled under the table, a high-tech version of ""On Top of Old Smokey."" Not what you want with a brand-new DVD. Hopefully Season Two will be packaged better.

1488250,4,B00005JMHI,"For any person that grew up during the 1980's, this is a must have, especially if you are a Magnum, P.I. fan.  I enjoy watching the reruns but if you are like me, the commerical interuptions disrupts the viewing.  I realized the show is as old as I am but hasn't lost its edge or effect.

I was very excited to see the orignal opening for each episode were in the correct sequence.  There is over 18 hours of Magnum, P.I. entertainment and I enjoyed watching each episode over again.

On a sad note, I was a bit disappointed in the way Universal packaged the boxset.  In order to save costs, Universal made each disc double sided, which makes it a bit problematic if you are concerned about smudges on the dvd.  The plastic casing was also made cheap and pressing too firmly to release the disc will crack the plastic.  I was hoping for the digital transfer would also be better. The sound skips often, but isn't a constant problem.  Hopefully if Univeral decides to release Season II, they won't act as hastely with the digital tranfer.

In conclusion, if you enjoyed Magnum, P.I., the boxset is worth having.  I am not disappointed at all but I hope in the future Universal packages the future boxsets with more care and pays closer attention to the digital transfer.  I would also like to view some deleted scenes and possibly some interviews with the creators, as well as the cast and crew.",1096329600,6,1394,4.50996015936255

1)  Having shows on both sides of the DVD was unnecessary cost-cutting.  You don't see this with the more recent shows put on DVD.

2)  DVD number 2 has production quality issues - constant skipping and fluttering.  Same issue with the set bought from both amazon and wal-mart.

3)  I cant put my finger on it, but the show theme music doesnt sound quite the same as it did on the original series - perhaps some remixing?

Other than this, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the shows again - much better than what passes for TV entertainment today.

I would recommend waiting until they fix the quality issue before buying.",1095897600,7,670,4.601694915254237

1488355,4,B00005JMHI,"Finally these DVDs are here!  What is wrong with universal now days?

DVD is bare bones. Packaging is as cheap as you can get.  4 DVDs, both sides are used.  No graphics on the DVDs because they are double sided. Box is paper multi fold out. No information or additional materials in the package.  Episode and disc (and disc side) listing on the back.

They couldn't expend the effort to make a quality product, but they had time to put advertising before you could get to the DVD main menu! DVD menus, etc. are as basic as you can get.  No real options or extras on the DVDs.  Prior to each episode is the TV preview/teaser for the episode, followed by the intro sequence (original as per episode thankfully).  Picture and sound quality are adequate, but not great.  As someone else has mentioned the chapter breaks are beyond stupid (not at obvious points, at original commercial breaks, etc.)  The DVD does include a 'play all' option though.

Basically, little thought or effort was put into making these DVDs a quality product.  I think they just finally relented to the hoards calling for the DVDs and threw them together over a weekend.

Should you buy them?  If you are a fan (and you know you are) they are a must have since there isn't a better alternative.  They are much better than those old VHS tapes you have and the hacked up episodes now showing on Hallmark and WB.

We can hope that Universal will pull their heads out on the following seasons (and that they will release those soon!).  Extras would be nice (like commentary), but I would be happy with high quality picture and sound, intelligent chapter breaks and half decent packaging... and a movie staring the original cast. :-)",1095206400,8,1701,4.59468438538206

1488357,5,B00005JMHI,"Just recieved this great set and I couldn't believe I had to wait for so long! If only they had spent a little more effort! As has already been mentioned, there are ablsolutely no liner notes or supplementary documentation (booklets) included in the set. (Actually there's a spot for a booklet, with a spammy flyer depicting other DVD sets available, having nothing to do with Magnum.) As well there are no audio commentaries, no interviews, no press releases, no deleted scenes, and not even a photo gallery or trivia program. I guess the company that owns the rights to this does not want to spend the money it would take to provide these features, since there is currently no big budget movie remake starring Markie Mark or whomever as Magnum, to provide current popular interest. (Thanks to Christ and God and Allah, and may there never be one unless Selleck himself would be asked to reprise the role..)  Previous reviewers pointed out that the picture quality is good, but I think they may have only watched the pilot episodes before posting their review. I suspect that the pilot is the most heavily reproduced episode, and it may have been remastered for a previous video release, because it looks great. Subsequent episodes suffer from huge amounts of grain, and when you watch the night scenes, you can hardly see what the heck is going on because it's so dark and muddy. Island airial shots are blurred and grey looking, and the yellow titles at the beginning of the show looked particularly garish. The audio as well, is about the same quality it was back in 1980.. Stereo, NOT 5.1 surround, and obviously just a quick copy transfer as well.  When you press play on the menu and the first episode comes on, it seems to ""burst"" right in, like its a second too late, and the guy has already said half a word. This makes it seem like your cousin taped this off tv for you, and pressed record a second after the show started. Kinda amateurish. Just a side note, the disks themselves are cheap silver press double sided, not gold press, another sign of cheapness from the manufacturer. My final beef is the chapter stops. As anyone who actually watches DVDs knows, and those who sell them obviously do not, the chapter stops should be as follows: teaser - stop - show titles - stop - show segement to first commercial break - stop - and so on.. I'm sure that's obvious.. This raises the question of why so many companies making DVDs insist on putting the first chapter stop like, 8 minutes into the show, in the middle of someone's sentence, instead of doing what makes sense.  After the first couple of episodes, poeple will want to skip the titles by pressing next, not by scanning forward because the chapter stops are in crazy random places in the show. I'm sure that Universal Studios can afford better than these production values on a DVD set for a show which was so popular. Please Universal, could you possibly actually remaster the shows from now on?!? That's all I ask. Even if there's no interviews with the cast or other features please just remaster the picture! I would be happy with just good looking eps. I would even be willing to pay a little more for the new sets if they could improve the quality. (Hopefully the future possible DVD sets aren't already crappily mastered, awaiting pressing, (The way Paramount did the Star Trek: TNG sets) because then Universal could actually do more for future installments.) I hope they make the rest of them soon or I will go into a Magnum withdrawal induced coma after I finish watching this set. As others have pointed out this release is ridiculously long overdue and still seems to be a much neglected property compared to other old shows.. Please Universal, don't make me have to put myself into cryogenic freeze with orders to thaw when season 2 Magnum DVDs come out!",1095120000,11,3838,4.649484536082475

I grew up watching it with my dad every week and have waited for a collection like this for a long time.  My recently taped episodes from A&E left something to be desired.  After anxiously awaiting this for months, I admit I had some disappointment with this set.  Although it contains all the super cool episodes from the first season, the collection lacks bonus information like liner notes.  Many far inferior programs, not to mention those more recent in our memories, have been released with information like episode summaries and, just as important, episode air dates.

1488360,5,B00005JMHI,"The first thing I should say is ""FINALLY!!!!""  I have waited a long time for my favorite ""P.I."" show to be put on DVD-especially as what seems like dozens of less memorable shows have made their DVD dbut.

The visual quality of the DVD's themselves are above average-which is saying something in that the first season is now almost 25 years old.  Even some of the more recent TV shows put on DVD have a grainy or washed out appearance that look even worse if shown on a larger than average TV screen.  This edition has sharp color and shots of the Hawaiian landscape and sea line are wonderful.

Of course, we don't buy DVDs to look at the pretty colors.  The story is the thing.  Detective stories themselves aren't so much about the ""crime"" as how the story is told and the characters that walk ""on stage"".  Indeed, from the very first episode, the characters of Magnum, Higgins, T.C. and Rick start to cook.  Several other minor characters will come in and out as the series progresses; but it is the interaction of these four that makes this series work.  Vietnam and its aftermath form the back-story for everything in the present.  Most of the time this is more implied than stated.  Magnum, T.C. and Rick are all veterans of Vietnam and that failed war was the crucible where their adult lives and friendships were shaped.  Their ordeals in Vietnam and that war's ultimate failure lays like a heavy blanket on all their souls-in spite of the fact their serviced loyally and heroically.  Their connection with Higgins is a little more indirect.  Higgins is also an honorable soldier from the wars for a collapsing empire.  (Some of the ongoing humor throughout the series it that while he has had a long, varied and exciting military career, Higgins habitually focuses on the most boring aspects and tales of his service.)  The irony is that each of these men served in lost causes yet they seem to be the very ones needed to confront trouble in paradise.

Magnum at the time marked a change in Hollywood's' depiction of the Vietnam veteran.  Toward the end of the war, soldiers in Vietnam were most often portrayed as innocents thrown into the meat grinder or depraved war criminals that killed women and children and burned down villages.  After the war, the Vietnam vet was shown as a dysfunctional individual suffering from drug addictions and posttraumatic stress-a ticking time bomb that could snap and kill any and all around them in civilian life at anytime.  Magnum was the first major character in popular culture who depicted the Vietnam vet as a good man who weathered the storm and was an essentially healthy individual.  Magnum marked the public transformation of the Vietnam vet from a shameful baby killer into a proud and honorable patriot who served an often times ungrateful country through some of its worst events.

That being said, the character of Magnum is kind of a decent, respectable Naval officer who reverts to a late arrested adolescence.  As he says in the pilot, he woke up one morning 33 years old and released he was never 23.  So he resigned his commission and took up the life of a private investigator.  Except he has no office and he lives in the guest house on the estate of Robin Masters loosely for the purposes of ""security"".  With practically no resources and less money, Magnum solves complicated crimes and protects clients in distress by the seat of his pants.  Magnum has the friendship and loyalty of many friends; but, much like James Garner in the ROCKFORD FILES (another excellent ""P.I."" series), he gets little respect and his Private Investigator business is never quite a success.

At the end of the series, Magnum goes back to the Navy.  But in the meantime, Magnum solves crimes no one else can, meets lots of beautiful woman, makes friends with some unusual and unlikely people, and makes a fool of himself at least once an hour.  It is that delicious mixed cocktail of seriousness and humor that Americans love and has to be blended just right that is served up almost every time that sets Magnum P.I. above all the rest.

Each DVD disc has five episodes.  Three on the first side and two on the second.  All episodes are their original length-not edited down as many of the syndicated offerings are.  Here's hoping all the remaining seasons are released and the quality is maintained throughout.  Some may wonder with all the movies out on DVD why would anyone bother with a TV series.  The answer is that films rarely can give you the enjoyment of watching a story unfold over a long period of time.  Magnum is like the friend you love but you find so silly at the same time.  He's that guy you know that wins all the time but for some reason can't quite get it all together.  He may be something of a Bozo-but he's a great Bozo.",1095033600,8,4795,4.641755634638197

1488482,5,B00005JMHI,"Like the art work on a book's dust jacket, the soundtrack to a TV show or a movie reflects the tastes and values of the time in which the book or film was made.  Ian Freebairn-Smith's theme music and incidental music used in the first season of MAGNUM, P.I. reflect motifs and big band arrangement styles in the JAZZ of 1980: tight harmonies, string accompaniment, a plucky electric bass line.  It recalled the detectives and P.I.'s portrayed in film and on television in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  But this musical style is not one that is accessible to a lot of people.

When Magnum's producers brought in Mike Post and Pete Carpenter  to revamp the soundtrack and theme music, the new composers didn't so much update the music, as create a sound more accessible to more viewers.  They carried over that plucky electric bass in their theme.  They gave us a theme which we all can hum or sing.  They contributed in no small way to the show's accessibility, popularity, and longevity.

We are fortunate that Universal chose to preserve Freebairn-Smith's music in the DVD first season release.  It is a piece of TV - and popular culture in general - that deserves preservation and recognition.  It is where the Magnum, P.I. phenomenon started.  I for one love F-S's Magnum music, but admit that bringing in Post and Carpenter was a really smart move.

The soundtrack has never sounded so good.  And the visual appearance is stunning, despite the use of slightly less than perfect films for the DVD transfer (note the occasional dust fleck).

My only reservation is about what Universal is up to by including the two-part ""Echoes of the Mind"" and the crossover ""Ki'I's Don't Lie"".  Are they planning some viewer-unfriendly tricks for future season DVD sets?

It is a delight to have Magnum and company back on the screen!

The two Cross Over episodes with ""Simon & Simon"" and the two part episode with Sharon Stone ""Echoes of the Mind"".

Each episode also includes the previews that were shown prior to the next episode.  Although they are played right before the episode, they are a nice touch.  There are no bonus features, but I am not bothered in the least.

Sure, it doesn't have tons of bells and whistles or extras, but what it does have is 22 episodes.  18 of them are from the first season 1980-1981 and the other 4 episodes are from other seasons including a two parter from 1984 with a very young Sharon Stone.

The colors are so bright and alive that you would swear that it was made today.  If anything I'm ready for season 2 of Magnum to come out soon because this is great! (That and Miami Vice, because seeing what they did with this release I can't wait to see what MV looks and sounds like.)  I do think this is great because this was one of the (and I hate to use this term but here it is.) ""must see tv"" of it's day.  This is well worth the money and the wait and a good starting point for people who were too young to remember the show during it's CBS run or are turned off by the looks of the tv reruns.",1094688000,5,1152,4.0

The picture is crystal clear and the sound is better than I expected in Dolby Digital 2.0.  And for those like me who did not remember the original theme music featured in the pilot episode.....just be glad they changed the theme to the one we all remember!!  =)  I will enjoy Season 1, and hope to see Season 2 soon.",1094601600,,449,4.126436781609195
1488487,5,B00005JMHI,"If you were around to watch the original Magnum TV series, you already know whats in this. I watched the original series during my high school years and sitting down and watching the series again reminds me not only of those times, but of how good the show was.

If you never watched the original show, let me just say that introducing yourself to Magnum and his pals would be well worth your time. This is the ultimate ""buddy"" show. The dynamic that evolves between the main characters is a rare pleasure to watch. Some of the episodes (The two parter called ""Ivan"" jumps to mind... but that will have to wait for later season releases)are particularly well done and have some amazing moments.

Of course, there are going to be some stinkers mixed in there. But to be honest, they are particularly few and far between.

One of the best elements of the show is the relationship between Magnum and Higgins. Its the classic love/hate deal with a level of mutual respect that sustains a very funny back and forth of gotchas between the two.

Once all the seasons have been released, and you watch that final episode with Magnum walking off into the sunset in his dress whites on the beach with his daughter in hand, you mill most likely wonder three things. First, when will they make a movie so we can all see what happens next. Second, did Rick or didn't he? Finally, you will be just a bit jealous that we can't all have the kind of friendships that Magnum, TC, Rick and Higgins share.

Of course, there is the technical side of the DVD. Frankly, I was not too optimistic about the likely quality of the video. I am happy to report that the transfer to DVD is just about as clean as anyone could possibly hope for. I am watching the DVD on a 50"" rear projection LCD TV. So any quality problems with the image would be particularly obvious. Also, my DVD player is an older Toshiba model. No progressive scan or any of the other common quality boost features you find in newer decks. The bottom line is that there is no reason to be concerned in any way about the quality of the transfer, it's top notch.

So take the time to introduce yourself to Magnum and his friends, you won't regret it.",1094515200,146,2190,4.421836228287841
1488488,5,B00005JMHI,"For the reviewer below who was asking, these are indeed the full, unedited episodes! The Pilot is always split into two parts in syndication, although it was originally shown as a movie-length episde in one part. It's in two parts on the DVD but if you select ""play all,"" it is the full version and runs about 93 minutes. If you play it as 2 parts, part 2 starts exactly where part 1 ended so nothings missing. Of the other episodes I've watched, they come in just under 50 minutes--they were somewhere around 49:45--which was the standard for tv shows back then. I've taped some episodes off of Hallmark Channel, and they seem to come in at about 45 minutes, so they cut quite a bit out. As for the quality, I've never seen the show look this good on tv. There's some dust here and there, moreso in scenes where they use stock footage, but for the most part I think they look incredible! Everyone needs to go out and get this set if you're a fan--you won't be disappointed. Yes, there aren't any extras, but hopefully we'll see some in further seasons, which we'll only get if everyone buys this first season. The menus start with TC's helicopter flying across the screen to the familiar theme song and then different scenes from the show. There's a ""play all"" option and chapter stops too. Also, the pilot and the first episodes have the different theme song that was used before they switched to the one that everyone knows. I haven't watched them all, but I believe I read that the switch takes place sometime during the first season. Get this set!",1094428800,12,1552,4.50709219858156

I started collecting episodes recorded from A&E, and then they dropped it!  Hallmark has picked it up, and I have collected all but one episode - all eight seasons, with the exception of the second half of the episode named ""Memories are Forever"" from the second season.  I would love to have all the seasons on DVD, because the VHS collection of 50+ tapes takes up a lot of room, and the quality of VHS recorded off of satellite leaves something to be desired.

What made Magnum such a great show is the depth of the characters. We really get to know these people. Every episode adds to the character in some way. And there are enough reoccuring characters in the series that we feel continuity. For example, Magnum strikes up a friendship with leutenant Mac, who gives Magnum information from time to time. And while Mac is reluctant to let Magnum get information from the Navy computers, the tug of war in their relationship is played out just like it should. And when Mac gets in trouble, Magnum is there for him. The personal relationship is real on the screen, the actors are that good.  I can't expalin it any better than to say they feel like real people, guys I would want to hang out with and drink a beer with. I can easily say this is the best PI series ever on TV, and is better than anything on TV today.
And add me to the list of people who wants to see a reunion movie while they are all still alive. I can't imagine Higgings is getting any younger.",1089590400,7,1159,4.2207207207207205

1488682,4,B00005JMHI,"Magnum P.I. is my favorite TV show of all time. I will gladly purchase all 8 seasons on DVD if they are released. Season 1 aired during the 1980-1981 TV season, and consisted of the 2 hour pilot, plus 16 regular 1 hour episodes.
Season 1 is a great introductory season. However, it's also one of my least favorite seasons. That's not to say it's a bad season, because it's not. However, season 1 doesn't have any of the truly outstanding episodes of future seasons, such as ""Memories Are Forever"" (season 2), ""Did You See The Sunrise?"" (Season 3), ""Home From The Sea"" (season 4), ""Echoes Of The Mind"" (season 5), ""Limbo"" (season 7), and ""Unfinished Business"" (season 8). Thus, I'm giving season 1 a 4 star rating.
The episodes from season 1 are:
""Don't Eat The Snow In Hawaii"" - This is the 2 hour pilot. ""Don't look at the dogs. Work the lock. Work the lock. Don't look at the dogs. Oh! You looked at the dogs."" This is a great introduction to the series. However, if you really want to recruit new fans, I recommend you show them the season 4 episode ""Home From The Sea.""
""China Doll"" - This is a good action/adventure story.
""Thank Heavan For Little Girls And Big Ones Too."" Magnum gets hired by 5 little girls. Not one of my personal favorite episodes.
""No Need To Know."" - This is my favorite episode from season 1. Alfred Hitchcock said that having a bomb go off isn't suspenseful. What is suspensful is knowing that there's a bomb that's about to go off. The last several minutes of this show are Hitchcock all the way.
""Skin Deep"" - This is the episode where Magnum seems to think, ""Well, as long as she's dead, I might as well eat the food in her refrigerator."" And I love Higgins's graphic descriptions of the effects that a gunshot wound has on the human body when fired from various distances. This is one of the better episodes from season 1.
""Never Again Never Again"" - Magnum realizes that ""Kessler is a Jew."" Yes. And later he would become Doc Ibold. Good episode from this season.
""The Ugliest Dog In Hawaii"" - Actually, the dog looks fine to me. But this episode if just too formulaic.
""Missing In Action"" - A mysterious plot involving the military doesn't save this relatively boring episode.
""Lest We Forget"" - Another routine episode with too much forumla.
""The Curse Of The King Kamehameha Club"" - Since the Club plays such a big role in the series, why not give it its own episode?
""Thicker Than Blood"" - Magnum and T.C. get into a big fight.
""All Roads Lead To Floyd"" - The old guy is a really, really bad driver. Boring episode.
""Adelaide"" - A good story about a woman and her horse. Women sure do love horses. Pretty interesting story. And the horse knows how to defend himself.
""Don't Say Goodbye"" - The Ted Danson character gets killed by a boat propellor.
""The Black Orchid"" - This is a very enjoyable episode, with some nice homages to Bogart type characters and stories. This is one of my favorite episodes from season 1. The presence of guest actress Judith Chapman makes this a very interesting episode. She will return in the far superior season 2 episode ""The Woman On The Beach,"" which, in my opinion, is better than anything from season 1.
""J. Digger Doyle"" - We get to see and hear Robin Masters in this episode. Notice how he gets his ideas from everyday occurences.
""Beauty Knows No Pain"" - Magnum gets a little more exercise than he had wanted.
Magnum P.I. is my favortie TV show, and I think I have a right to point out its flaws. I never did like the idea of just blindly praising every episode. I recommend season 1 to all Magnum fans. But please keep in mind that most of the future seasons are better.",1086825600,38,3647,4.444776119402985

I hope it is not to late for the person that paid two hundred to stop their order for a transfer of VHS tapes of the show to DVD. This is by far one of the best detective series or overall television series I have seen. This is a show that you never get tired of seeing over and over. The cast and stories made it very watchable. Add in the gorgeous Hawaiin scenery and it couldn't be beat. Someday I hope that we may see Simon and Simon on DVD as well.

This set's picture quality is excellent. Seeing this on a High Definition TV is incredible. The splendid views of Hawaii will make those who have visited it reminisce. My only complaint about this first set is that Mike Post's theme song is only played at the Menu screen and at the end of the episodes beginning with the 7th episode. The original music played the first season was to brash and clashed with the events on screen. The music improves after this first season.

1488762,5,B00005JMHI,"When I FINALLY get around to writing my book: ""How to be a Private Investigator"", I'm going to write a chapter on how sometimes the great masterpieces get overlooked. Take the show Magnum p.i., for example. Here we have the first show to feature a tarnished hero in a good light, he is a Vit Nam War vet who when he came home, became a private detective who works out of the guest house of a well-known writer named Robin Masters (Orson Wells), but we don't see much of him, instead we see J.Q Higgins (John Hillerman) who sort of runs the estate in Robin's absence.
Thomas Magnum (Tom Sellick) surrounds himself with two old war buddies, an ace chopper pilot named T.C. (Roger E. Mosely) and an ace con man turned bartender (Larry Manetti). Now all of these guys help Thomas out with some major arm-twisting and bribing, but they usually come through. (Oh yeah, did I mention that they had some of the best shots of Hawaii for a television series to date?)
But unfortunately, we probably won't be seeing any of that on out DVD machines in the near future, because the guys who are responsible for putting these episodes on disk are more interested in putting the newer series' on DVD really, really fast. Shows like ""Threat Matrix"" and such. I mean come on, they should at least let the season finish airing!
