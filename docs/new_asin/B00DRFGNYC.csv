5850703,4,B00DRFGNYC,"For many Like Someone In Love will be a boring film to watch, but others are about to be engrossed by characters, their stories, interactions and even a drive through Tokyo. Or just be fascinated by the director's style. Or love the outside of main character Akiko (played by Rin Takanashi) and her appearance and hate her dilemma and inconsiderate duplicity. Or be engulfed in utter dismal sorrow at the treatment of Akiko's grandmother (played by Kaneko Kubota), which in terms of sheer emotional sadness is second only to Tomi Hirayama's life and death in Tokyo Story. In Tokyo Story too, the grandmother talks to a grandchild who does not hear or listen. Here is a film that in turn will induce absurdity, embarrassment, squirming, love, lust, hate, loathing, discomfort and pity.

Akiko is a typical Tokyo girl. She is from Fukuroi in Shizuoka. She is pretty, has a fianc and is ostensibly in the city attending university. She, however, leads a surreptitious existence. We know this soon enough because we quickly put two and two together based on her conversation with her fianc Noriaski (played by Ryo Kase) and the persons she shares a table with, a manipulative and filthy Hiroshi (played by Denden) and Nagisa (played by Reiko Mori).

Foreign directors in Japan could go one of two ways. It could be a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Translation-Blu-ray/dp/B001AQO400/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Translation [Blu-ray</a>] (Sofia Coppola - Grade: A) or a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Map-of-the-Sounds-of-Tokyo/dp/B0045ZAQRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Map of the Sounds of Tokyo</a>&nbsp;(Isabel Coixet - Grade: C-). Incidentally, look for sequences here in Tokyo and Yokohoma including Lumine Est in Shinjuku and several stores like Sweets Paradise, the entrance to Daisan Keihin Road and the Aoyama Book Centre. This is not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adrift-in-Tokyo/dp/B002ZDMHIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adrift in Tokyo</a>&nbsp;yet the drive sequence in Tokyo at night is so utterly commonplace and yet simultaneously so pivotal and thought-provoking. How could one not grade Like Someone In Love more like the former film than the latter?
As the film opens Akiko is sitting in a pub heard but not seen. This is the first of many intrigues in a story where most things are implied and perceived and not spelt out for us. Then we see manipulation and deceit in multiple back-and-forths. The story unfolds in real-time as a peculiar drama in which patience is a necessity. Should one persevere the film literally makes an art form of making the viewer guess what is going on now and what will come next. Images are seen as reflections, one overhears conversations being conducted off-camera and one listens for the consequences without actually seeing the incidents' instigators.

There are a few sequences of levity as with Akiko's interaction with Watanabe's neighbour and the latter person's with her brother. The earlier almost-monologue itself is delivered with breathless conviction. Speaking of which, each of the admittedly few cast members exudes an amazing ability to make the acting look easy when it is anything but. After all, it is anything but given that the character-driven focus and a lack of special effects and graphics will have to hold our attention. Yet, they do and at length. Ryo Kase, in particular, delivers such a convincing performance that I for one could not have foreseen after seeing him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-Clover/dp/B0014Z4ONY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey & Clover</a>. He might as well not have been an actor in a film, but a boyfriend being lied to by a woman in his real life (""I am not lying to you,"" she assures him as she lies to him) and deceived as usual making Akiko a shameless wench in more than one way. She plays it straight as the uncaring female type while Noriaski is as bewildered as any man who has lost a woman to dishonesty. Make no mistake about it. Like Someone In Love's honesty and cruelty lies in showing Akiko as a casual deceiver as she only outwardly frets to not be one or be unhappy about herself and her actions. Her acting is natural and matter-of-fact perhaps practiced from the life of a modern woman.

The film, however, disappoints many with its ending. It is just not there and like the rest of this piece of art leaves much to the imagination of the audience. Using the word `piece,' however, might be apropos given what the director likely wanted to convey at the end. Include in the disappointed group this writer. Likely a decade ago the joke would have been that the director and studio ran out of money. A more likely culprit is the Zen of Like Someone In Love. Zen is a Chinese Buddhist school that emphasized the now above all else. Earlier in the film Watanabe sings `whatever will be will be' and alternately counsels Noriaski to let it go and advises Akiko to stop fretting and let things happen. As it turns out he is ignored and is wrong (in that sequence), but the director and writer's script direction is based upon emphasizing the present moment at every turn. Amazing as it is Like Someone In Love falls short because it assumes too much and does not give us a definite ending. The DVD extras are impressively illuminating and interesting. There the director speaks of his vision, why he deliberately creates misunderstandings and how he deprives the viewers of their vaunted scenes in order to create a deeper reality. His praise of his crew and unscripted blurting out of ""to hell with American cinema"" for what it has done are instructive in the context he states them. Moreover, Akiko hints at an available alternate ending, while Kiarostami casually demonstrates that the actors were not given advance scripts to review or read.

Like Someone In Love is quite impressive in another regard. As mentioned, the grandmother is never properly seen, but even with the Japanese and the infinite capacity to sadden, her part is dismal. She is an old woman in a strange town longing for love and family having left her infirm husband behind for a day only to connect and bond and what happens instead is as sad as anything one could see. The build-up is masterful. Akiko's cruelty to, among others, the older generation and the latter's infinite patience is indeed alternately reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray-DVD/dp/B00EO2I6W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story (Criterion Collection) (Blu-ray + DVD)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yasujiro-Ozu-The-Only-Son-The-Critereon-Collection-DVD/dp/B00AYHRHE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yasujiro Ozu The Only Son (The Critereon Collection) DVD</a>&nbsp;and even more cruel because it is so easily rectifiable and generational. Kudos goes to the direction and cinematography which depict such loneliness all around in a metropolis of thirteen million. It should be noted - because of the earlier emphasis on the Japanese sensibility of the film - now that the story and direction come courtesy of an Iranian in this Franco-Japanese co-production, which makes it related to one of Japan's most controversial films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Realm-of-the-Senses-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B001PYD0KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Realm of the Senses (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>].

Akiko is a beautiful woman with such an ugly life, behaviour and personality, except that is how it is usually, isn't it?",1403049600,8,7801,5.680377035132819
5850704,4,B00DRFGNYC,"I love this movie.  Professor type gets himself involved in a not win type triad relationship.  Behavior is so realistic you feel you can reach through the screen and touch these people.  Adult situations but no hot scenes,  Just life going on and you wonder all the time is there was a better way for these people who seem to deserve more.",1402185600,9,340,4.435483870967742
5850705,4,B00DRFGNYC,"Anyone expecting the classical forms of plot and characteization in this film will be sadly disappointed.  LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE has a minimal plot - a young student Akiko (Rin Takanashii), who may or may not be a prostitute, visits the home of elderly writer Takashi Watnabe (Tadashi Okuno); an affection develops between them, even though no physical contact takes place.  Watnabe encounters Akiko's fianc Noriaki (Ry Kase), and convinces him that the two are related: Noriaki finds out that Watnabe is lying, and comes to his apartment and smashes a window,  Abbas Kiarostami's fiocuses more on shifting moods - the sad resignation of Akiko as she goes about her business, neither enjoying nor appreciating it; the blank face of the cab-driver who takes her to Watnabe's apartment; the wistful looks of Watnabe as he looks at Akiko; for him she might be both desirable yet also an object of regret for his own lost youth.  Kiarostami refuses to give us the security of explaining his characters' motivations; he leaves it up to us to make our own decisions.  Comprised of long close-ups interspersed with shot/reverse shot sequences, the film is more focused on what is not said, rather than the dialogue.  What gives LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE its true freshness is the quality of its visual imagery:: the film is chock-full of prison images: we see the protagonists sitting in Watnabe's car through the windscreen, the world outside reflected in the class; the bright lights of Tokyo streets fade into a blur as the yellow cab drives through seemingly endless long and straight boulevards; Akiko is seen sleeping in Watnabe's bed through the frosted glass of the bedroom door; while Akiko and Watnabe exchange their dialogue in the confined spaces of Watnabe's apartment or Watnabe's car.  Through such techniques Kiarostani shows us how the characters are prisoners both of themselves - and their inability to disclose their feelings - and the urban environment, which confines them both night and day.  The denouement is both unexpected and, in terms of the film's thematic preoccupations, quote shocking: by smashing Watnabe's window, Noriaki both literally and figuratively tries to break the prison-like atmosphere.  But there is a sad irony here; although we see the window breaking ,we do not see any resolution as far as the characters are concerned.  The title, and the Ella Bitzgerald song that is heard regularly on the soundtrack, are likewise ironic: the characters can never fall in love, but they merely act ""like someone in love"".",1399248000,22,2544,5.050119331742243
5850706,4,B00DRFGNYC,"A most thoughtful film.  The viewer feels compelled to try to understand the internal conversation that would going on in each of the three main characters.  So much is unsaid.  And chance encounters propel the story in an unexpected direction.

8596661,2,B00DRFGNYC,"Its unfortunate the filmmakers are so apparently ignorant of basic movie-making skills because their main characters are engaging, but go absolutely nowhere in a story that is stuptifyingly simplistic.  There are actually scenes that last upwards of 10 minutes or more--I counted 3 or 4--and there is absolutely nothing in them that couldn't be said in a couple minutes or less.  I'm a writer, and have literally never seen this in a movie before.  Unbelieveable.  And the ending is absolutely meaningless.

8596666,2,B00DRFGNYC,"I like foreign art movies and expected a lot from this Iranian director, but this one simply failed to register with me. The line between art and boring/pretentious is pretty fine. It is a matter of individual taste, but compared with the gold standard of Kieslowski or Almodovar for example, I don't really find any underlying message that moves me, makes me think, in this movie. I am not talking about the childish moral lectures Hollywood movies shove down your throat. This movie is like a beautiful and very detailed painting of an apple. Some people call it art and maybe get inspired, but for me an apple is just an apple especially when you are just watching it, even if I get impressed by the skills of the painter.",1468454400,,725,4.584615384615384
8596667,4,B00DRFGNYC,"Criterion should include subtitle in different languages considering all the the work the put in restoration, extras, etc.",1466380800,,122,5.833333333333333
8596668,3,B00DRFGNYC,"Perhaps this movie was inspired by the 1944 van Heusen tune ""Like Someone in Love."" It's a sentimental song about someone acting loopy because he feels like he's in love before any relationship has been established. In the movie, an 80-year-old widower acts loopy over a college girl earning money as an occasional prostitute. Because this takes place in Tokyo, prostitution doesn't carry the same kinds of negative connotations as in the US.

For a character-driven story, this film has little dialogue - it's largely visual and  moves along slowly. Like many foreign films (non-US), it doesn't have an ""ending,"" happy or otherwise. Rather, the story puts you in a contemplative mood and forces you to think (guess) about the characters. Some Americans (including me) can find this a little frustrating, if taken too far. One reason I enjoy foreign films is because I get tired of how US films often spoon feed everything to the audience and deliver a happy ending, no matter how implausible. For me, I suppose the difference between a good inscrutable foreign film and a mediocre inscrutable foreign film is how much it moves me and how memorable it is. For example, the Japanese film ""Woman in the Dunes"" is very powerful, a truly great film, and yet it has even less dialogue and is even more inscrutable than ""Like Someone in Love.""

It's not clear what the widower (Watanabe) wants or expects from the college student (Akiko). He doesn't seem interested in sex, at least not right away, and if he's after companionship and conversation, why choose a girl fifty years younger? They have nothing to say to each other, but Watanabe seems to take pleasure in caring for Akiko in a grandfatherly way. The situation becomes more complicated when Noriaki, a young man obsessed with Akiko, begins stalking her. Akiko remains passive through the entire movie; the only time she shows emotion is her fear of Noriaki.

I can only give this movie three stars. I don't regret watching it, but I can't recommend it. I mostly enjoyed the visual aspects, and I enjoyed the acting talents of the old man who, through his movements, speech and facial expressions, conveyed a sense of his loneliness, longing, doubts and uncertainties.",1438214400,,2222,4.901595744680851
