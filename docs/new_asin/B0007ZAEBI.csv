8054611,5,B0007ZAEBI,"Great Tutorial! Someone mentioned sound quality. They may just need to get an exchange. The disk has a warrantee. I have found that because this media is mass produced, often by another party that is equipped for the volume, quality can vary on an occasional disk. This is probably more to do with the software or disk failure. Not my forte. In regard to the tutorial I have two things I would like to have addressed in the future. #1 That Mr Pickering would address actual brush sizes..... inches or metric brush width and length, as brush #'s no longer are consistent between manufacturers. #2 That Mr. Pickering would make many more tutorials! This is one of the best I have seen from a learning point of view. The artist gives detail on all aspects of what he is doing. You do not just watch someone paint a painting. He is humble and a gifted artist, a rare thing. I encourage him to produce many more such lessons.",1330473600,3,920,4.482142857142857
8054612,1,B0007ZAEBI,"I am sure that Mr Pickering is a wonderful painter, but from this DVD you will never know. While the video portion of the DVD was fine, the volume was all over the place and uncontrollable, Whether on my desk top computer, laptop or on my DVD player. I would not advise anyone to waste their money on this product.",1329696000,,314,4.25

8054614,5,B0007ZAEBI,"The DVD is everything it claims to be. If you diligently follow the instructions you will learn how to create a seascape,even if you are a novice like myself. There is a little of everything: poetry, theory and practice. Absolutely worth the money.",1187827200,5,248,4.790697674418604
