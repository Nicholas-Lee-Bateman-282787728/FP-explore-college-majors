2642819,5,B000HT3S8A,"If you are a Tamilee Webb fan, you won't be disappointed. Tamilee can be counted on to create a challenging workout and this is no exception. She is more fluid in this routine and makes it fun. I would recommend this DVD for anyone that wants a challenging strength training workout that has pizzazz.",1181260800,3,300,4.574074074074074
2642820,4,B000HT3S8A,"I thought this was a pretty good DVD with effective 10 minute workouts. I was a diehard buns of steel and abs of steel user and I got this DVD as a Christmas gift. On days when I am rushing out the door to work or getting home late in the evening, I usually do the abs and arms sections and feel like I at least got a decent mini-workout in. I'd say the ability level is intermediate or so (not too easy but not too hard).",1176336000,4,422,3.8620689655172415
2642821,5,B000HT3S8A,"I you like Tamilee's ""I Want that Body"" DVD, then you'll also really love this one!  Tamilee is her usual positive, low-key, yet motivating self, and it's a great toning workout.

The DVD is broken down into three ten-minute segments that work your entire body through the use of three-pound dumbbells.  One of the segments focuses on abs, one on the entire body, and one on arms and shoulders.  There is also one extra ten-minute bonus workout that works your entire body using a resistance band.

Overall, this is one tough workout!  Tamilee has great new moves that are not on her other DVD's, and I certainly feel sore the day after doing this workout.  Just also be aware that this is a weight/strengh-training workout and not a cardio workout; although some of the segments did get my heart rate up, the segments are designed more for toning.

An additional bonus of this workout is that it also includes a three-minute warmup section and a three-minute cooldown.  The DVD menu includes the option of playing these all the way through with the three main strength sections, so that you don't have to constantly go back to the main menu.

There were only a few negatives to this video, none of which hindered my ability to enjoy it.  One negative is that the DVD is shot in a more ""modern"" (for lack of a better word) way that means that you're not always able to see what Tamilee is doing. At the end of each segment, she also starts stretching, but the camera cuts out before she's done (so that you can't finish the quick stretch) since the whole concept of ""tight on time"" means that they are trying not to waste any extra time.  The only other negative is that I wish the bonus resistance-band section was part of the main workout; in order to do this extra workout, you have to exit the workout, go to the main menu, do the workout, and then go back to the main menu in order to get the cooldown stretch.  It's nothing major, but it does take a little more time.

Overall, though, this is great!  I love Tamilee, and this video is of her usual high quality, with lots of new, intense moves!",1170979200,19,2101,4.463350785340314
2642822,5,B000HT3S8A,"Tamilee instructs you through classic moves, mostly using hand weights.  These moves are very effective because of the weights and since we're tight on time, targets muscle groups. My favorite new move: from a squat to plie with arm raises.  There are no modifications and I feel one should be in the intermediate to advanced level. This is her debut production and it has excellent quality: stage, music, camera angles, and the clock.",1169942400,6,435,4.945205479452055
2642823,5,B000HT3S8A,"I love Tamilee's workouts, she's always great!  I like this one for the short but serious workout segments!",1167868800,4,107,4.944444444444445
2642824,4,B000HT3S8A,"I have many Tamilee Webb dvds and that's because she's a great trainer.  She's very knowledgable and outgoing and motivating.  That's what you want in a good instructor and that's what you get here.  She makes this fun and not boring in the least.

There are three toning workouts (one on the floor and two standing).  You use basic moves and equipment like dumbbells (even for the ab workout).  She is a good cuer and that helps you stay focused on your moves rather than trying to figure out what's coming up next.  Each segment is toning - there is abs, arms and shoulders and a 'total body rocks' segment.  It's not the toughest workout, but like the title suggests, it is good if you are pushed for time but want to do a little something.  It has a bonus workout at the end using an X-ertube, but for the main workout, all you need is dumbbells and you're all set to go.  I like this and recommend it to busy people wanting to tone up a bit.",1161302400,31,946,4.264044943820225
2642884,4,B000HT3S8A,"You can do 15 minutes, and add segments based on time. It is great hard exercise. She does a great job targeting all parts of the abs",1368144000,,133,3.962962962962963
2642885,5,B000HT3S8A,"These workouts aren't nearly as intense as her I Want that Body workouts are, but if you've only got 10 minutes and want to squeeze in a quick workout, these are great.  I also like to do them after breaks in exercise to ease back into exercising.",1367971200,,247,4.25531914893617
2642886,5,B000HT3S8A,"I really like this workout video. It's broken into 4 - 10 minute sessions. You can play all for a nice 40 min workout or pick and choose which sections you want to do. I like to do this workout on days where I do not want to do an intense cardio workout. The workout does contain a bit of cardio but mostly it's mostly aimed at toning...you will need 3 or 5 pound weights. The moves are very easy to follow. You won't feel like you're dying after doing this video, but you will break a sweat and get a nice workout in! Highly recommended!",1360022400,,538,4.084905660377358
2642887,5,B000HT3S8A,"Good as new! No scratches or skipping on the CD, not to mention it was super inexpensive. Good workout also. Overall, I think it was a great purchase and I would recommend this to anyone.",1329436800,,187,4.371428571428571
2642888,5,B000HT3S8A,Love this work out dvd! I normally dread having to work out after a long day at the office but Tami is so upbeat and to the point it keeps me motivated to put in the dvd. I recommend this to anyone with a busy life or just looking for a fast work out.,1324512000,3,251,3.6666666666666665
2642889,5,B000HT3S8A,I've had this DVD for almost two years and am writing this review as I set out to order a copy for my 20 year old daughter...she loves it too!! Easy to devote 10 minutes before work and lots of session choices.,1315353600,7,210,4.023809523809524
2642890,4,B000HT3S8A,"I'm a fitness walker who always hated strength training (I find it boring). Last spring my doctor told me I had osteoporosis at the ripe old age of 40 (a genetic gift from my mother), and I needed to start taking 2,000 units of D and strength training. This DVD really takes the pain out of strength training for me...the moves are mostly easy even for a balance-challenged individual like myself (though I do have a hard time following Total Body Rocks), they're only ten minutes so I can fit them in before or after my power walk and before work, and they're effective - you just need to increase the weight when they become too easy. I'm due for another bone scan in two years; it will be interesting to see if this and the vitamin D do the trick and reverse some of the bone density loss. If it helps to tone me up, so much the better!

UPDATE: Well, two years later, and my doctor's recommendation worked! 2K units of Vitamin D3 every day plus the ToT video and my bone density has improved so that I'm no longer in the osteoporosis range. Plus, I love how NOT time consuming these exercises are!

2642891,5,B000HT3S8A,I love Tamilee Webb because she tests the effectiveness of each workout routine in the lab. If you do not have a lot of time to work out each day this dvd is your best choice.,1301011200,,175,3.888888888888889
2642892,4,B000HT3S8A,"My favorite segment in this video is in the extra section.  You will need a band, but is a great full body workout.  Tamilee is buff!",1297382400,,133,4.076923076923077
2642893,5,B000HT3S8A,"This is a great workout.  I do this work out every other day and combine it with the other Tamilee Web Tight on Time Body Blast 2006 (Cardio-Core-thighs) which I do on the in-between days.  This routine helps me keep in shape.  I had frozen shoulder and the arm exercises helped me to get back in form.  When I first started, I was really out of shape and it took awhile before I could do all the exercises in the time that she does them.  But the great thing is that with a DVD you can push the pause button, take a little rest, and then continue until you reach her level. I would recommend using the two DVDs together to exercise your whole body. You will need to get some 2-3 lb (or 5 lb. if you are that advanced) weights to do the workouts.

The exercises are split up into 10 minute segments so you can do what you have time for. The introductory warm-up exercises keep you from straining any muscles and the yoga type relaxing exercises recommended for afterwards are wonderful.  My lower back always gets back into place when I do them and my neck muscles really relax, too.",1291248000,8,1083,4.279411764705882
2642904,5,B000HT3S8A,"Love her work out and the DVD was in excellent condition and came promptly.
Thank you!",1284422400,,86,4.4375
2642905,1,B000HT3S8A,Just received this video and there is a problem with it. Nothing on my screen appears when I put it in my dvd machine. I returned the product and am hoping for a better product.,1242691200,2,177,4.085714285714285
2642906,4,B000HT3S8A,"Nice sectioned workouts. The best part about Tamilee is her calmness and friendly personality. I just love her. However, even though I like this workout, there are some drawbacks: I like to max out on weight based on body part worked, but this isn't really possible with this because it moves pretty quickly using the same weight throughout. But that doesn't bother me as much as the fact that she has a tendency to leave out chest (she does that also in her 'I want that Body' video), I can't figure out why. Otherwise, very good video indeed.",1224028800,2,544,4.561224489795919
2642907,5,B000HT3S8A,"This was my first Tamilee Webb dvd. I had to come write a review because I was so impressed with her. First of all, her personality is great. I for one was tired of the video instructors that were either to mechanical and drill-sergantish, or too bubbly, over-hyper, and equiped with a ""more beautiful than thou"" attitude. Tamilee is a refreshing down to earth, no nonsense instructor who truly makes it feel fun and do-able to complete each workout.

Aside from being thoroughly impressed with Tamilee as an instructor, the workouts themselves are great. I have never been able to stick to one exercise rutouine for long. For me, 30 min. on an eliptical at the gym feels like foreverrrr. Because this workout is divide up into 10 minute sections, it goes by amazingly quick. I'll start one section with the intend of doing only it, but I'll always end up doing two more sections after that because the time just flies by. And it's fun. I find I'm actually looking forward to my exercise rather than dreading it. Which sets me up in a positive mindset toward my workout routine, day after day, so I know I can stick with it. And I know I'm getting a good workout. I don't always ""feel the burn"" during every exercise, but I'm always sore the next day. Tamilee makes it so easy to follow along - I never feel confused about what exactly I'm supposed to be doing. The other great thing is, you can increase the weights you use, and the intensity as you get stronger. If you feel like you're not getting a good enough work out, you're probably just not taking full advantage of the workout (i.e. really contracting each muscle as you do the exercises, or just increasing your weights).

I've been using the workout for a week and a half now, and I'm already seeing results. I feel stronger and more toned, and I'm able to do some of the optional harder posistions that I couldn't do before.

To think I almost didn't buy this workout for fear of it being another unused video on my shelf! This was the best money I ever spent!",1219708800,6,2023,4.476964769647696
2642908,4,B000HT3S8A,The best part of this is the clock that ticks down in the corner while you do the workout.  You can constantly see where you are and it makes the workouts much easier to complete.  The ab workout in this video is not as good as her abs of steel previous workouts.,1216857600,,263,4.038461538461538
2642909,5,B000HT3S8A,"Great Work out dvd, especially if you are pressed for time.  Feel the burn.",1216684800,,75,4.357142857142857
2642910,3,B000HT3S8A,"I've been working out with Tamilee for a long time, but I'm having a little trouble keeping focused on her in this video.  Not a wrinkle in sight so she's almost expressionless, and her lips are pulled so incredibly tight she can barely speak.  I once admired her for how gracefully she was aging, but now it looks like she trying desperately to fight it.  The workout was good, but she was just too distracting for me!",1212451200,,419,4.415584415584416
2642911,5,B000HT3S8A,I like this DVD very much. I love the clock counting down your time. So motivating for me! the workouts were great with variations and effective moves. A plus in my book!,1210032000,2,170,4.34375
2642912,5,B000HT3S8A,"Tamilee is my favorite instructor, and this is a great program to have for those days that you just don't have time to do a full workout. Each workout is ten minutes (one abs, one arms and one total body), but it really feels like you're working your muscles even in the short amount of time. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't have alot of time in their schedules to fit in long workouts.",1200614400,,393,4.253333333333333

8141358,5,B000HT3S8A,"I like this because Tamilee does not do a lot of yammering that I abhor in other exercise videos.  I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (38 years) and am at the point where I can do moderate exercise.  This is not fast paced, so is easy for me to keep up with.  Three days in a row fatigued me for over a week, so need to take it even slower.  For overweight people, this would be a good starting point.  For people who are more fit, one can use the weights and rubber bands she uses for a more strenuous workout.",1470009600,,508,4.04

I made the mistake of thinking since I just finished the base P90 for everyone (not X, X2, or X3, the base P90 for everyone) that I would fly through this and not be challenged. WRONG!
