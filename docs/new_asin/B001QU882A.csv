3770835,5,B001QU882A,"This is my favorite 10 Min Solution DVD and I own almost all of them. I understand how it can be frustrating for some exercisers, because the choreography is fast and with some complexity. That said, you will definitely get an effective cardio & core workout when you do it correctly. All the segments end with a very short but efficient stretch that feels like a continuation of the dance.

- Latin Beat: My favorite. Quick-moving latin combos. You get mambos,
  chachas, flamenco, merengue and even a little tango. I had
  a lot of fun learning this one.

- Dancer's Sillouette: The emphasis here is to elongate the body doing a
  routine that feels like a tai-chi and modern dance fusion.
  I feel taller and more graceful after this segment, so I
  do it last. Easy to learn because is the slowest.

- Belly Blaster: The fastest; you'll need lots of energy. The routine is
  complex, but it really works the abs. The moves range from
  jazz squares to mambos and snakes.

- Attitude & Energy: A sexy routine , I feel like a backup dancer. You'll
  do a lot of shoulder moves, attitude walks, a kick
  ball-change and arm reaches.

-Fat Burning Beat: You'll burn  calories and work your core with
  chest-pops, hip moves and knee-ups.

These routines are taught by Petra Kolber, who has like two decades of
experience in fitness and who was the star of many Reebok videos. She was
an 'IDEA Instructor of The Year' and she was first trained as a dancer.  I think you are in good hands here; so listen to her cues and have fun!",1243123200,8,1528,4.478102189781022
3770836,2,B001QU882A,"I'm sorry about this review - I am going to be honest.  I love Petra - she is great and has amazing enthusiasm and provides a lot of encouragement as always, but this isn't good at all.  I'm actually even sorry that I purchased it.
First off, it has as much chance as burning off belly fat as eating M & M's.  Secondly, she is too quick to get onto the next step and there isn't clear instruction on how to do the moves.  Sure, you can pick them up down the track, but there is no proper guidance and also, being that she's the only dancer, it's hard to see her positioning ... there should either be more dancers so you can see people at different angles and copy their moves, or there needs to be clear instruction.  I didn't say Clearer instruction, because there is actually none at all.
I didn't enjoy this and in fact I barely even made it through the very first segment (the latin portion); not because I'm not fit, but because it's 'complicated'.  Even if you are co-ordinated, it's not overly easy and any exercise routine that needs too much figuring out is a waste of my time.  I'd rather buy something with simpler movements that I can then do more efficiantly and with more oomph, so I can actually burn some calories ... sorry.",1243036800,,1241,4.323275862068965
3770837,5,B001QU882A,"I didn't even buy this on Amazon I bought this at Best Buy 2 weeks ago and since then its been my favorite workout video. I must say, this video does not break it down, it just dives right in, so beginners and the uncoordinated, beware! As someone who has a lot of dance experience I appreciated the challenge as I'm tired of wimpy dance workouts and this one is definitely not wimpy. Latin Waist Sizzler workout is fast paced and she demonstrates a lot of fun latin inspired moves like merengue, mambo, cha cha, even a little flamenco arms/hands. Dancers Silhouette workout uses abdominal isolations like rib slides and balance exercises to tone the core muscles. The rest of the segments are consistent and challenging but also very fun. If you are a good intermediate to advanced dancer and looking for a dance workout thats challenging try this one. If you are a beginner or looking for something easy look elsewhere.",1241222400,21,921,4.691358024691358
3770838,1,B001QU882A,"I have almost every 10 Minute DVD and this one is horrible.  The woman does not give ANY instructions on the dance steps, she just expects you to know them.  In the first two minutes of the first section, she expects her audience to understand dance moves with five to seven different parts to them.  I turned this one off in disgust and put a trusted DVD in the player.  Don't waste your money.",1241136000,6,395,4.297297297297297

3770848,5,B001QU882A,"I like this DVD. It's got different 10 minute workouts so it doesn't take too long to do.
She does a good job of building the routines in a short time.  I sometimes attend Zumba class and I find that her moves are similar and it's a good way to practice.",1415404800,,254,3.980392156862745
3770849,1,B001QU882A,"If you are a dancer it have been to hundreds of jazzersize and Zumba classes, you may enjoy this. If you just want to give it a try to get a quick workout, pass on this one. It is SO difficult to follow!",1412812800,,203,3.744186046511628

3770852,1,B001QU882A,"I like most of the 10 minute solution DVDs- I bought this one because it was inexpensive and I like the idea of 10 minute mix-and-match segments. I've done a lot of workout DVDs and while I'm no serious dancer I can usually follow along fairly well.

This workout is way too complicated- complex steps that aren't explained well, cuing is poor, and it moves way too fast. By the time you think you can get the hang of one combination, she's on to another one without telling you. Instead of feeling good at the end, I felt frustrated and like I'd wasted my time and money. I tried to give it another shot but didn't have the patience to get through it. I wish I hadn't bought it.",1395187200,,679,4.263565891472868
3770853,5,B001QU882A,"This is one of my favorite workouts.  It is really great.  You dance while working the abs, as well.  It is fabulous.  You won't be disappointed in this one.",1393718400,2,157,4.310344827586207
3770854,2,B001QU882A,In a few words I don't like it . I am not looking for slow and simple but she is hard to follow and the moves are blurry and...sloppy at times. Its like she is making it.up as she goes. Hopefully I'll have more fun with other ten minute dvds,1375833600,,241,3.84
3770855,4,B001QU882A,"Ok, this is a tough dance DVD. I've done other 10 min solution dance DVD's and almost everything that Jennifer Galardi has put out there (thank goodness!). Part of the problem with this DVD is the order that the 10 minute sections are in. The last one starts off with a warm up, and the one before she mentions ""You're going to be seeing a lot of these today"". The second one is much slower paced and easy. I think the best order to do this DVD in is 5, 4, 3, 1, 2, because it's in the last segments that she introduces and explains some of the moves. If you start out with the first one on the DVD, she just jumps right in and it's pretty intimidating.

Aside from the order being not so user-friendly, after you do it a few times, you'll get the hang of it. This is the nature of dance DVDs! Sometimes it is fun to do something that not only challenges you physically, but also mentally (like remembering routines). It's definitely not for a day when your nerves are already frazzled, but if you're up for learning some choreography, this is it. On another day when you just want to do exercises without having to remember a lot, do Biggest Loser or Lindsay Brin's Boot Camp. They are more of the ""do alternating lunges for a minute. Now do pushups for one minute"" type of workouts.",1370649600,2,1284,4.283950617283951
3770856,5,B001QU882A,"Each 10 minute segment is similar to one of Petra's other DVDs, so it gives you a sampling of her style. There's something similar to Liquid Grooves, 3 2 1 Dance, etc. Really enjoyed it, at a great price! Petra is fun, good instruction, choreography is not too complex, everything I love in a dance workout.",1355875200,,307,4.5
3770877,5,B001QU882A,This is an outstanding workout video and Petra Kolber is really tops.  I enjoy all of her vidoes and have bought as many as she produces.  You will enjoy the workout.,1294531200,,166,4.32258064516129
3770878,4,B001QU882A,The instructor is fun and energizing. I liked all the 10 minute sections but the first one. This workout really works your abs!!!,1288569600,,129,4.6521739130434785
3770879,4,B001QU882A,"After trying some of the other 10 Minute Solution dance DVDs, I was very eager to try this one.  And it was a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but compared to the others, this DVD just didn't measure up quite as I expected it to.

Petra Kolber leads this DVD, and she tends to teach the choreography very rapidly, not giving you much time to learn it before moving onto the next move.  I didn't find this much of a problem, however, because a lot of moves repeated themselves in her 10 minute workouts such as the rock/triple step, throwdown, box step, and mambo.  The choreography on the most part consisted of these basic aerobic moves with a slight dance twist, which I found to be good cardio but not as dancey as I would have liked.

The segments on the DVD are:

Belly Blaster - This routine is pretty much a jazzy routine that will contain most of the basic moves that you will see later.  It is pretty easy and straight forward with a lot of hip shaking going on in it.  It was a fun routine, but it wasn't a favorite with me.

Latin Flavor Waist Sizzler - THIS was my favorite routine, as Petra added a Latin feel to these aerobic dance steps.  There were, once again, some basic steps in this routine, but there were also some complicated steps such as the Tango in it, as well.  This routine challenged me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

Attitude and Energy - This was a kind of retro dance style aerobic section with moves such as the Elvis in it.  I was expecting to like this routine a lot more, but once again, it contained many basic moves that I had seen before with just a couple of things to make it slightly fresh.

Fat Burning Beat - This was a really nice mixture of hip-hop and jazz dance steps.  It had everything from Raise the Roof to Chest Pumps in it.  This was probably the danciest of all the workouts, and I was extremely pleased with this combo.

Dancer's Silhouette - I wasn't expecting to like this segment, but it turned out to be great!  There are elegant moves in this routine, and I really enjoying the flow of the dance.  Each move made me feel good, and I really felt my core engage in this routine.

Now, the core is supposed to be the main focus in all of the routines, but really in order to get a great ab workout, you'd have to really focus on your abs the entire time which would take away from the fun of the dance.  And, yes, while the dance moves repeat themselves and are very generic, they are fun, and they move fast enough to keep my interest.  Another thing to notice is that the routines are symmetrical, meaning that once you complete the routine on say your right leg, you then go on to do it on your left leg.

Overall, this is a pretty good workout DVD that goes a little too fast for beginners, yet has a few too many repetitious moves for the advanced.  However, it goes very quickly to keep the viewer from being bored, earning it a rating of 4 stars.",1278201600,,2911,4.231884057971015
3770880,2,B001QU882A,"I can't hear her voice over the background music.  I don't have this problem with other dvds and I tried adjusting my sound settings, but it didn't help.  I realize her instruction isn't absolutely necessary, but it's annoying.",1277942400,,227,4.947368421052632
3770881,3,B001QU882A,It's convenient because each session is only 10 minutes BUT the instructor goes SO FAST. There's only about 2 sessions that I can do because the moves are easy enough that I can mock her without much explanation. Quick and frustrating!,1274227200,,235,4.7560975609756095
3770882,3,B001QU882A,"I don't have much dance background, but I have never had any problems with the other 10 Minute Solution Dance CD's.  This one is much more difficult and does not have much instruction included.  I have been through it about six times and still don't have the steps down.  I think it would be a good workout when (and if) I can go through the whole segment without having to rewind several times to figure out the steps.",1267574400,2,419,4.346153846153846
3770883,5,B001QU882A,"I purchased this video as I need to lose some inches around my middle.

I may have to start reading diet recipe books next.

3770884,2,B001QU882A,"I did my best, and will keep on using this, but the moves are really hard to follow.

I don't have a dancing background at all, and that may be my mistake.  I figured there would be more instruction on how to do the moves, but it was very minimal.  Some of the segments are easier to follow than others.  Of the 5, I think that Dancer's Silhoette was the easiest to follow.",1250899200,,373,4.068493150684931
3770885,4,B001QU882A,"Before I counter some of the claims by other reviewers, I'll tell you about the DVD.  As billed, the DVD consists of 5, 10 minute segments, supposedly designed to work your abs.  Unless I concentrate extremely hard on my abs the entire time, this work out doesn't really work your abs.  The DVD is probably designed to decreased over all body fat, and therefore belly fat as a result.  You can customize a workout by putting as many as 6 segments (with 1 repeat segment) into any order you choose.  The ""Dancer's Silhouette"" segment isn't really cardio, it's more overall toning. The music choice is great, and Petra is encouraging and fun, as always.  The cueing is adequate.  There are very brief warm ups and cool downs with each segment.  My complaint with this DVD is that I don't like my cardio broken into short segments. I feel like it's hard to keep my heart rate up; that's why I gave this DVD 4 stars instead of 5.  However, I know that's the point of the 10 Minute Solutions DVDs and I don't own any other 10 Minute Solution DVDs for this reason.  I bought this one strictly because I am a big fan of Petra Kolber.

Several reviewers complained about the lack of instruction.  However, with the segments being only 10 minutes long, I don't know how there is time have every move broken down at half-time.  Petra would never make it through more than 3 moves in 10 minutes.  There are times when Petra breaks the moves down at half-time, for moves that are a  little more challenging.  I don't think this DVD is very difficult.  If you can do box steps, mambos, pony steps and a kick, ball change, you can do this DVD.  As with all excercise DVDs, the first time I try the DVD, I falter; but with successive attempts, the DVD gets easier.  There are no complicated turns, and the one time Petra introduces a turn, she says you don't have to do it.

I do prefer Petra Kolber's 3-2-1 Dance [ASIN:B0010QH1GE 3 2 1 Dance]].  If you really like dance DVDs, without the short segments, I highly recommend 3-2-1 Dance.",1246665600,17,2022,4.455040871934605
3770886,5,B001QU882A,"This is a great workout.  Petra is a great teacher, very professional, great cueing and fun choreography. There is no warm-up.  There are 5 - 10 minute routines.  I would have prefered a few less ""box-steps"" and ""mombos"" but the quality of the production far outweighs any of my personal wishes.  If you like to dance your way fit,,, then this is a DVD for you.",1244332800,5,361,4.424242424242424

8336376,5,B001QU882A,I really like this DVD. The different dance sections are fun and silly. Petra is always cheerful. Some of the dance choreography does take a few times through to learn the steps. I like to do the Dancers Silhouette bare foot.,1496275200,,225,4.512195121951219
8336377,4,B001QU882A,"I like Petra Kobler very much - she has a charming personality and is very motivating.  I took off one star because I find in this dance dvd, that her instruction is not so great.  She teaches you as she does the move herself, which can be frustrating.  At least, it was for me, and I love to dance!  However, despite that one hindrance, I really like the workout itself - it's excellent.  I particularly like the hip moves of which there are a lot.  Having flexible hips is really important to good health.  I'm sure that if I do this dvd more often, I will get Petra's moves down pat, and I know that it's worth it.",1492646400,,617,4.177966101694915
