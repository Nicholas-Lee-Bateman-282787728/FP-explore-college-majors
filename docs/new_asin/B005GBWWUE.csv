8649209,5,B005GBWWUE,"""The Mean World Syndrome"" is an insightful and disturbing film based on a series of interviews with media scholar George Gerbner.  Gerbner's analysis suggests that pervasive violent programming doesn't create violent behavior so much as it cultivates fear and anxiety among heavy-viewers of the endless action movies, cop dramas, violent video games and the like.  Moreover, the sensationalism of crime reports in the news can instill a personal sense of vulnerability and distrust of our fellow human beings.  While Gerbner is no stranger to the potential for cruelty in the world (he fled the Nazis in his native Hungary, and fought them as a U.S. soldier), he is concerned that our perception of the world and each other as relentlessly mean and violent lends itself to the creation of authoritarian ""get tough"" policies and a growing prison industrial complex&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Texas-Tough-The-Rise-of-America-s-Prison-Empire/dp/0312680473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire</a>.  Gerbner also argues that our personal sense of being under threat contributes to an exaggerated sense of national insecurity, which is exploited by our government to carry out violence in the world&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killing-Hope-U-S-Military-and-C-I-A-Interventions-Since-World-War-II-Updated-Through-2003/dp/1567512526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killing Hope: U.S. Military and C.I.A.

""Mean World Syndrome"" also reveals the shameful way that Latinos, blacks and Arabs are dehumanized in the media.  With our ongoing invasions, drone strikes and occupations, war propagandists have been particularly active in stereotyping Muslims and portraying our victims as villains&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reel-Bad-Arabs-How-Hollywood-Vilifies-A-People-DVD/dp/193286900X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reel Bad Arabs How Hollywood Vilifies A People.

This film is only an hour (plus 20 minutes of Extra segments), but will have lasting effects on how a person views the media.  Far from being a ""liberal"" source of news and views, the media is more often a reactionary influence owned and sponsored by corporations that routinely mix rightist politics with their profit motive (anti-labor, anti-environment, serving the richest 1%, etc.).
Corporatists will even target children in their crusade to maximize profits; as concerned parents have been saying, the explicit agenda of some industries is to mold the attitudes of young people around the world&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Consuming-Kids-The-Commercialization-of-Childhood/dp/B009M6FPWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Consuming Kids,The Commercialization of Childhood</a>.
