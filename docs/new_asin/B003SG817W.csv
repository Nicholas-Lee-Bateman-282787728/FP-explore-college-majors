4188227,5,B003SG817W,"I love this DVD because of the options. There are three sections, and you can pick whichever one you want for the day or all. The 30-minute cardio option is great for days when your time is limited. The 40-minute dance option is a fun continuous cardio routine with three styles of dance, all fun to do and easy to follow. Those two options are more mid-level. You will sweat but I was not pushed to the limit on either. The 45-minute option is the hardest routine and is great for days when you have more time and want to work a little harder. This DVD is like three in one and a great value. I love The Firm workouts because they always start the choreography moves simple and then build. I can't always get the steps on the first runthrough, but I like that because it's a little bit of a challenge. If you want a DVD that will not be boring after a few runs, this is it.",1299110400,21,874,4.147058823529412
4188228,5,B003SG817W,"I love The Firm and am particularly fond of Allison's workouts.  This one doesn't dissappoint.  Super fun and gets all of me.  She switches from cardio to weights with a small breather inbetween, which I appreciate.  I feel worked-out and rejuvinated after doing this workout.",1297641600,13,276,5.066666666666666
4188229,5,B003SG817W,"Have been a Firm fan for about 2 years now & needed something new.  Well, after much research decided to try Power Burn 45 - boy am I happy I did.  Since I received it last week, it's the only DVD I have needed.  There are two 40 minute and one 30 minute work-outs.  While all 3 are good, my favorite is the Ultimate Power Burn!  Of course, I am still learning a few of the moves, but even if I am not exactly on target with them, I am still sweating by the time I am done!  Would definitely recommend this DVD!",1290384000,15,511,3.912621359223301
4188230,5,B003SG817W,I actually already have two of these workouts so I bought only one extra with this. I'm a big Firm fan and these are all good workouts; one is a good 30-minute workout. Alison is one of my favorite instructors. I like the new dance workout with Allie. It's fun although and not too long at around 45 minutes. A good buy to get three workouts in one.,1288396800,5,349,4.147058823529412

4188243,3,B003SG817W,"I have totally enjoyed (and recommended) THE FIRM series for years. However, I am not impressed with this DVD. I don't know if it is because of my age (61) or what, but I find the exercises hard to follow. They are not adequately cued and so few repetitions are done before changing that It is very hard for me to follow.",1391212800,2,321,4.193548387096774
4188244,5,B003SG817W,I have many on the firm DVD's and this one gives me three great workout. I would recommend this to my friends and family/,1363737600,3,121,4.083333333333333
4188245,4,B003SG817W,"I love the Firm and have many of their workouts.  I particularly like it when there are multiple options on one DVD.  There are 3 on this DVD.  Alison is my favorite instructors and her workout is my favorite on here. I like Sue Mi's workout but she is not quite as experienced leading these routines.  I like Ali alot as well as an instructor but the dance workout is my least favorite just because I don't feel coordinated enough sometimes.  Overall, I do like this DVD.  It's a good value and gives variety.",1363305600,,510,4.372340425531915
4188246,1,B003SG817W,"This is the second Firm DVD I've bought. I have decided that I will never buy another one again. Way too dancy, zero flow, and the way they have you flail around weights at break neck speed is awful and dangerous. I am a relatively fit person so I'm no stranger to exercise so that is not the problem. These are awful",1357171200,3,317,4.129032258064516
4188247,5,B003SG817W,"I L O V E the FIRM workouts! Allison is by far my FAVE but I really liked all of these!
Instructor Sue Mi Powell really stepped it up in this one.  Ali had a cute & catchy cardio routine and great arm reps!
Two things to look out for though; ALWAYS LOOK AT THE TITLES ON THE MULTI-TITLE ONES! I already had these 3 workouts in one SEPERATELY! Of corse I will still give a GREAT REVIEW! I scratched one of the three so I was glad to see it on here!
I'm a cardio junkie but I must incorporate toning too so I say BUY IT!",1318291200,4,518,3.7962962962962963
4188248,2,B003SG817W,"I assume that experienced dancers are the target demographic for this workout collection. Unlike the other reviewers, I preferred the first workout over the other two - because it was easier to follow! The two after that had dance moves I just couldn't figure out or were unwilling to do. Sticking my chest out, shimmying about and generally ""dancing"" like I was a music video girl is not my idea of a fun workout, so I turned off the second video pretty quickly. The third video had some of the same moves as the first, plus some silly dance moves that I think are way too complicated to be really necessary. I don't want to spend my workout trying to figure out the instructor's footwork, and I ended up giving up on this workout halfway through. Dance is definitely not my type of workout, but the first video is pretty useful to compliment videos like the 30 Day Shred. It has two paired sessions of cardio and sculpt, the latter being moves with small weights. The cardio sections are full of kicks, high knees, and some simple step moves. The second section of the cardio part gets harder with near-continuous jumping. The sculpt sections are full of squats and lunges. It's not exactly hard, but I'm always sweating at the end of the workout.

As far as the instructors are concerned, I still preferred the first. She does go fast but that helps a beginner like me plow through it. It's a challenge, and that's what made it fun. She also has one of her workout buddies doing modified moves for the beginners, which the other two do not seem to offer.

If you're suffering from knee pain, I would not buy this video. There are lunges and jumping, and since you're doing it fast, you can easily get the moves wrong and hurt yourself more.

This is the first The Firm workout tape I bought. I'm not completely sold on the company.",1308441600,3,1834,4.501501501501502
4188249,5,B003SG817W,"This is a great DVD>>> First workout by Sue Mi is only so-so, but the second one, the cardio dance routine by Allie was awesome~It was fun, kept my mind off working out and before I knew it, was over. Also, the pace was perfect. I was able to tweek some of the moves for my Reebok Step, which I like to do, to ratchet up the number of calories I burn. She is great for queing - lets you know what is coming up and you really don't miss steps. LOVE HER. I was able to buy it on blockbuster.com for $10.99. GREAT WORKOUT, GOOD FUN AND IT goes by fast!!",1308182400,3,550,3.919642857142857
4188250,2,B003SG817W,"I was hoping this video would be different-it was all aerobic.  I was looking for a workout tape similar to a Jackie Warner, P90X or Jullian style.  This is not like that at all.  If you're use to aerobics with women changing moves every 10 seconds, you'll love this.",1302134400,,267,4.408163265306122

You're getting three workouts totaling two hours!  I love that the exercise routines are varied and never boring.  In the past I sometimes had difficulties following the cueing on some of The Firm dvds, but not on this one.  I can't say enough good things about this dvd - I'm that happy with it!",1505865600,,464,4.597560975609756

8404298,4,B003SG817W,"Great workouts. There are 3 45 minute workouts: Cardio Inferno, Cardio Dance Slim Down, and Ultimate Fat Burning Workout. I didn't really like the Dance workout because you have to learn a bunch of coordinated moves and I was too busy trying to that that I couldn't get my heart rate up. My favorite was the Fat Burning Workout.",1443744000,,328,4.576271186440678
8404299,2,B003SG817W,Been doing The Firm programs for over 20 years - so sad how it's deteriorated from the best music to the worst! Actually had to turn this one off mid work-out. The whining/moaning vocals are simply too distracting when you're trying to concentrate on the great workout routine The Firm programs have always been known for. Last one I'll purchase.,1425600000,2,346,4.783333333333333
