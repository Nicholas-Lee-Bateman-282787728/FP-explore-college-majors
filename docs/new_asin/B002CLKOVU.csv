3906259,5,B002CLKOVU,"From the title you'd think the movie is a Skinamax or Show-It-All time late night offering, but it's actually a sweet, thoughtful movie about a guy having an existential crisis from his failure to make it personally, professionally or romantically.  Everybody's always clamoring for something new and different while the theaters are crammed with sequels and adaptations.  Well, you don't get much more new and different than this.  Low budgets be damned.  This movie is fun!  The stick figures were an especially nice touch!  Don't try to figure it out.  Just enjoy it for its bizarreness.",1256515200,,590,5.083333333333333
3906260,4,B002CLKOVU,I was pleasantly smiling to myself with the stick figures that break into story. I think the title is somewhat misleading and overshadows the issues being raised in the story.,1256428800,,175,4.866666666666666
3906261,5,B002CLKOVU,Another pioneering story from Brad Gottfred... loved the originality and honesty of the film's theme as well as the execution. Highly recommended.,1256428800,,146,5.681818181818182
3906262,5,B002CLKOVU,"How many times do you watch a movie and it is simple, 1 dimensional, and plain?  Too many movies these days don't offer conversation...  Orgies makes you challenge yourself and ask yourself questions.  The director is brilliant and sees so many things that the average mind cannot grasp until challenged.",1256428800,,304,5.04
3906263,5,B002CLKOVU,"Employing live action, animation, and experimental story techniques to explore existential, professional, and sexual crisis, ORGIES AND THE MEANING OF LIFE is one of the more unique movie going experiences you will ever have.",1256342400,,225,5.647058823529412
3906264,5,B002CLKOVU,This is a must see!  The acting was brilliant.  The lead actor really touched me.  I think this movie helps us all explore the meaning of life.  The Stick Figure sequences were a brilliant touch.  And if you are in the mood to watch some sex scenes this movie has got that too.  Watch Orgies and The Meaning Of Life.  You won't be disappointed!,1256342400,,344,4.28125
3906265,4,B002CLKOVU,"the scene with the animated stick figures having sex was hilarious
sometimes it felt like the filmmaker was in my own crazy head.",1256342400,,129,4.6521739130434785
3906266,5,B002CLKOVU,Much more philosophy and becoming of age than sex. God being a lonely boy who imagines a world to love is a beautiful image. Watch this and find your own 3rd dimension.,1255910400,3,168,4.28125

3906293,5,B002CLKOVU,"Don't go by this title, it is R rated for a reason. Yet, it's more than that. This movie lets you think about being truly happy. I say not everyone has found their special happy person. They could be looking forever but never find the right person. So, we settle down with whoever and pretend we are happy while still keeping your inner fantasy person or persons in your head.",1437523200,2,376,4.385714285714286

3906312,1,B002CLKOVU,"Hands down, the dumbest thing I've ever seen. I may never forgive myself for suffering through it after having the urge to kill it after 10 minutes. The stick figure cartoons are about as lame as you'd expect from a stick figure cartoon, and the human protagonist is even worse. If this is ""philosophy"", Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star is astrophysics.",1415836800,5,350,4.85

3906316,5,B002CLKOVU,"Not sure why this is coming up in an erotica category. It's sensual, sure. But it's a coming of age film, in my opinion, and definitely worth a watch. I think everyone will get something different out of it -- in a good way.",1267315200,3,224,4.113636363636363

8364151,1,B002CLKOVU,Not what I expected.  It was nothing about the meaning of life.  More like someone is going to be with your wife.,1492560000,,113,4.090909090909091
