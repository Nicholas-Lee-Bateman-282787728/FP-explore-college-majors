2441094,2,B000BTITFI,"Now, I may not be the best critic in the world, but i've seen better movies than this while having a bowel movement. I love Bow wow very much but WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS??? you could tell that a white man wrote this s***. The music was great but that was it. These boys, Nick cannon, Bow wow and all the other little boys did not know what went on in the 70's and neither did the director. It wasn't funny and the skate moves were so wack.

  Bow wow looks like a monkey with all of his hair cut off, Nick cannon looks like a played-out pimp with his ""Stylish outfit"" Mike epps just looks freaky and Charlie Murphy needs to take his dark ass to a tanning salon. He get tanned so bad that he'll end up white (just joking).

  If you didn't see it already, don't see it. You'd have more fun watching a sidney Poiter film if you must  see a 70's movie.

  Any way, Bow wow isn't a good actor. he should stick with singing before he gets booed off the stage for his crappy work.",1133654400,,973,4.020833333333333

2441098,3,B000BTITFI,"I bought this primarily because of Megan Good - and the roller skating.
It delivers on those counts, the plot is your typical Cinderella story competition type thing, there are no surprises.

2441113,5,B000BTITFI,"altho, to be fair -- I'm IN it as an actor!  :)

Working on set for a month, all of us wearing crazy 70s clothes from wardrobe, was great!
The story line is pretty good.

The roller skating sequences are phenomenal tho' !
they brought in various professionals nationwide to be skaters in the film, even if they did not have speaking roles.

Wayne Brady is really as funny in person, ad libbing off the top of his head, as any character he has portrayed in tv/movies!

Great memories both of working on the set with all the great people, and watching the final film at the cinema!",1465084800,,579,4.324074074074074

2441132,3,B000BTITFI,"I love this movie. It potrays the seventies as a really cool time. The skating moves were awesome and the plot was really cool. The actors were great, especially Mixed Mike (Khleo Thomas) and X (Shad Moss a.k.a. Bow Wow). Although, Nick Cannon wasn't all that great.

The music was really great and it definitely fits the movie.

2441137,5,B000BTITFI,I love this movie for some reason. Probably because as a teenager in the early 90's the roller rink was the place to be on Friday and Saturday in my small town. The characters I met there totally remind me of some of the characters in this movie.,1435968000,,246,4.145833333333333

The roller coaster ride of emotions. The fantastic music. The outfits, simply amazing. Roll Bounce is the one movie you cannot go a lifetime without. If you are on the fence about watching, just think Nick Cannon in a fringe vest with an afro roller skating around Bow Wow and his friends who are all emerging into the gloriously awkward time we call puberty. Yes, this is a story of hitting puberty. In the hood. During the disco era. It doesn't matter who you are, you need to see this movie as soon as you can.",1428969600,,690,4.3984375

The movie brought back some really great memories from my childhood...the roller rink and dance moves that go along with those days. The story was very cute, and I could totally see my niece (or any other teenage girl) getting into the movie. Definitely for the younger crowd...but a good one to just watch and enjoy.",1396828800,3,493,4.24468085106383

2441167,4,B000BTITFI,"I have to say we where disappointed because we didn't receive the movie. I'm sure it got lost in the mail.

The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because when I emailed the owner of they movie. He responded immediately and gave me a refund. I really appreciate that. That holds a high standard for me. And high respect.

It could've so easily been handled in a different direction.
So, thank you.",1389052800,,394,4.3108108108108105
2441168,4,B000BTITFI,"This movie is great fun, especially if you are, like me a teen in the 80's. I worked as a DJ in a roller rink then, and so this brought back many memories...this film also has some touching parts as the main character irons out his relationship with his widowed father. And some stuff so funny that you nearly lose yourself. Very enjoyable and safe for the whole family. I also encourage you to watch the special features because most of these actors had never skated before and they learned a lot!

2441170,5,B000BTITFI,"This movie brought back so many memories ! Wow! The cast was amazing! I wasn't their age I'm mor of a eighties kid! But I do remember the roller rink and how important it was! How you hooked up with that ""special""person. Some parts of the movie may seem racist but its love between""brothers""! Back then your ethnicity was uber important and you couldn't get away from it especially black,interracial ,Hispanic,light skinned black but completely black! The prejudices of the black working class was evident . A college educated highly experienced black man gets down sized and ends up being a janitor! I am not preaching but it is eye opening to see this way of life as matter of fact. If you want a billion laughs and great music nostalgia for some. Eye candy for some! Being swept away for an hour and fourth mins. Please be my guest and go for it.

The sights and sounds of the rink are well captured, as are the moves of the skaters.  It was a wonderful period and this film captures it perfectly.  The plot and acting are believable, there's real emotion and while not a bit-time Hollywood release, it's a great family film to be enjoyed by all.

Keep the horrendous computer generated special affects and overuse of sex to sell other movies, if you want to watch a film that was made from the heart, this is it.  A genuine, touching story that seems to be absent in a lot of today's films.  This one warmed my heart, and took me back to a great time in my life.

I love to skate weekly and that made me want to buy this DVD initially...

So about the movie:
It is inspiring because it makes you want to get better with doing fun things on skates ;)
But for people how don't skate but just like fun movies or/and dance movies this will make you laugh I'm sure even though it has some sadness in it too.

It has some extra futures on the DVD that I always welcome! Sadly enough not to much on the skating it self.
Oh and the deleted scenes are pretty good and some super funny.

I give it a 4 out of 5 because I don't give to 5 that easly",1307491200,,697,3.8531468531468533

2441194,5,B000BTITFI,"It's the summer of '78 and if you're looking for good times there is just one place to go: the local roller disco, where the music is hot, the girls are hotter, and the entire atmosphere is dynamite. It is here, under the swirling colored lights and the spinning disco ball that thousands will experience lessons in friendship and love--and sometimes life teaches that you have to really get down in order to get back up on your feet. It all begins with Xavier Smith, also known as X, a young roller wiz who, along with his crew, once ruled supreme at their South Side of Chicago rink, the Palisades Garden. This movie is funny and honest and has no shortage of infectious musical interludes.",1262649600,,692,4.544
2441195,5,B000BTITFI,I finally got around to seeing Roll Bounce and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you grew up in the late 70's and early 80's and frequented the skating rinks you are going to have a blast to the past and a good time. Enjoy.,1251504000,,215,4.023255813953488
2441196,5,B000BTITFI,"I was 7 years old in 1978, and the first time I saw this movie, which was on cable over a year ago, was like taking a trip in a time capsule. I honestly felt like I was back in the late '70s, during the days of Jimmy Carter, ""What's Happening"", and Fat Albert, which are all mentioned during the course of the film. The music, and pop culture references are very accurate. Of course, when the song ""Roll Bounce"" is played, I couldn't help but smile, and point out that song came out in 1980, but with that being the title of the movie, I let that one pass;-) I only noticed one small error in regards to '70s life. This was the scene where the guys are watching ""Soul Train"" one afternoon. The stage/setting was not like that in 1978. It looked more like a clip from around 1972 instead. Again, this is such of a minor oversight, it does not at all take away from the movie. The feel and essence of the late '70s is captured beautifully. There was a simplicity then which I cannot quite describe, but then again, I do not have to. The movie did it for me! I could not believe the the precision. It reminded me what a fun time that era was to grow up in. It truly was a great time to be a kid, and after seeing ""Roll Bounce"" just ONCE, you will see what the experience was like in specific detail.",1244678400,,1296,4.106299212598425
2441197,4,B000BTITFI,"Synopsis:  It's Chicago in 1978.  Xavier ""X"" Smith (Bow Wow) has aspirations of being a top roller skater.  Adversity is working against him though, as his mother died leaving his dad (Chi McBride) to raise he and his sister on a working class income.  Unfortunately, the local roller rink had to close, forcing he and his friends to go to the Sweetwater roller rink, which is in a more upper-class (read: snobby) neighborhood.  X and his crew get belittled by the rink's clerk Bernard (Nick Cannon) while getting shown up by the Sweetwater Rollers and the star of the rink, a skater with the gift of game named Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan).  Despite all that, X remains affirmed by his loyal friend Naomi (Meagan Good), with whom the relationship starts to turn romantic.  Meanwhile, his dad is going through the struggles of adjusting to single fatherhood while trying to give his son the right direction in life.  How will he and his dad end up?  And will X be able to prove to everyone he can be an elite roller skater?

Now, I was changing through the channels when I left whatever station that was broadcasting this on.  I came back, it was starting and I was like ""Bow Wow and Nick Cannon?  I dunno...""  But then I noticed Chi McBride (who's actually one of my favorite actors as of late) so I was like ""... go on..."" and decided to watch the film.  I'm glad I changed my mind because I really liked it, and if you met me you'd probably be like ""Uh, YOU liked this movie?""  You're darn right I did, and I'd be glad to watch it again too!

What I dug most about it was the message that I took away from it:  It's better to strike out swinging than it is to not step up to the plate at all because even if all you did was try, you still get respect whether you're successful or not.  The movie's protagonists did have hardship to overcome, but everything was remarkably affirmative without being predictable.  I was also a fan of all the cameos in the film, as Charlie Murphy, Mike Epps, and Wayne Brady all made appearances in the movie.

I recommend it and especially recommend it for teens and families who'd find the material age appropriate for their kids (really, aside from some occasional language and crude humor, there wasn't much that I'd consider objectionable.)",1240012800,,2278,4.509756097560976

2441204,1,B000BTITFI,"In perhaps the stupidest movie concept of all time, Bow Wow leads a cast of young, mostly black actors, who will stoop so low as to ""star"" in a ""movie"" with someone named ""Bow Wow"".  Roll Bounce has as much heartfelt drama as gastrointestinal surgery, and does nothing but create a black hole of suckage from which no serious actor will ever emerge.  When this movie gets approved, you know the integrity is at an all time low in Hollywood.

The premise is simple enough: kids dance-skate in competitions.  Bow Wow is their leader, and he leads in the most pathetic way possible, with bad acting, idiotic lines, and a collection of scenes only a mother could love.  It's truly awkward, in a ""parents catching their teenagers having sex""-way.  The circular skating rink action reminded me of nothing more than a turd circling the bowl, except the movie stinks slightly more.

Of course there is some sort of strife, some challenge to be overcome.  Naturally, it pits the stereotypical, down on their luck, once-dissed group of Bow Wow sycophants versus the rich, bad guys, who happen to be a tad whiter - evidently it's a necessity to divide among racial lines in order to get anyone to like this movie.  Of course, the eventual ultimate battle, the most foreshadowed and anti-climactic climax in the history of cinema pits Bow Wow against a skating version of Afro Ninja.  The movie is replete with 70s slang, teenage cracks that can only make an imbecile laugh, and contrived situational humor written into the script by someone with a sense of humor similar to people who laugh at the jokes on America's Funniest Home Videos.

The only redeemable aspect of this movie is that Charlie Murphy makes multiple cameo appearances.  Otherwise, it's painfully horrible, and should only be viewed by extreme masochists.",1203206400,,1812,4.847402597402597
2441205,4,B000BTITFI,"I didn't expect to like this movie and if it hadn't been for the fact I'd just returned from a busy business trip and was too tired to look for the remote control, I wouldn't have watched this film.  But, boy am I glad that I did.  What an wonderful nostalgic film.  Some times you forget just how fast fads come and go and I totally remember the roller skaking days and hanging out at the roller rink or when my favorite film was Roller Boogie. Ha!  Anyway, I enjoyed not just the throwback elements but that it had a solid story showing how a father and son reconnect after losing the family's matriach.  Watch this film.

When I think back to 1978, I am full of joy. I was only 9 going on 10, but everything about the late 70's to me, even at that young age, was magical. The scene where the younger kids were throwing water ballons at Xavier and Tori, that was me, my brother and our little friends!!! I almost get choked up whenever I see that scene because that's exactly how we looked!!
The music, the clothes, everything about the 70's I love to look back on!
Bow Wow, Jurnee Smollet, Chi Mcbride and the rest of the crew did an excellent job.
I'd like to see a Roll Bounce 2 set a year later in 1979 where Sweetness and his crew challenge the Garden Boys to a rematch. That would be good!",1183075200,,823,3.993939393939394

2441209,5,B000BTITFI,"What to do on a weekend? Sit back, do my hair and watch this entertaining movie featuring Bow Wow. This was a good movie to enjoy and be reminded of what being a kid was back in the day. Rolling skating was an activity that kept children like Xavier Smith and his friends out of trouble and allowed for them to have fun.

Bow Wow does it again playing a youth affected by the death of mother. He keeps onto those skates because it was a present from her and it is the memory that he has of her. He had to learn to let go of his loss and move forward.

This movie is exceptionally worth watching.",1172361600,,595,4.033898305084746
2441210,5,B000BTITFI,"While at my sister's place this weekend, my neices and nephews had this DVD and asked me to join them in watching it. I initially passed, dismissing it as tennybopper trash (Bow Wow at a skating rink? COME ON!), but they put it on while I was in the living room, and I was really drawn into it.

First of all, as a young teenager in the late 70s myself who would occasionally go to a skating rink (to watch more than anything else), they really got the period atmosphere right. This was obviously written by somebody who was there at the time.

Secondly, the bond between Bow Wow and Chi McBride as the father and son is quite heartwarming in the wake of his mother's death, as well as his bond with his friends.

And yes, there's the music and dancing. The choreography is as good as all the above factors.

Seventies kids and their modern children will enjoy this together as a family experience. Go for it.",1170806400,,909,4.3609467455621305

2441212,4,B000BTITFI,"This movie didn't get the advertising it deserved and it wasn't in theatres long enough for people to discover just how good it is. First of all, it's appropriate for the whole family.  I own it and have seen it 3 times; it always makes me smile.  The basic plot is: Xavier & his friend's skating rink closes & they have to go to a new state of the art rink across town.  That rink has a skater there called ""Sweetness"".  He has an entourage with matching outfits, dancing girls, his own theme song and even fainting fans!  Xavier and his crew challenge them to a skate-off contest.  No, this does not give away the plot at all.  Also, Xavier, his sister & dad are grieving over the death of their mom & wife, respectively. There's no sex and violence, just a very very nice movie that shows African Americans in a positive light.  There are some comic moments, and also some heartfelt ones.  The music is great and it made me want to go roller skating again.  The clothes and hairstyles also brought back some good memories.  Buy this one.",1156291200,4,1040,4.392670157068062
2441213,4,B000BTITFI,"Roll Bounce is probably one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a few years. The acting was good, the dialogue was good, the skating scenes were fantastic. I'm not a Bow Wow music fan but I was impressed by his acting abilities here. Most of the actors were good except for Meagan Good who seemed too uncomfortable for anyone to take seriously. Other than Xavier(Bow Wow), the rest of the characters are very wooden but the actors do their best to display the differences in personalities. By the first five minutes you begin to figure out that Xavier's friends are just there so he can have someone to talk to for five minutes. Other than skating together, his friends didn't seem necessary which was a shame because the supporting actors were very interesting to see at times. You really get the point that X's friends aren't of much importance during the skate-off. I kept wondering how come X's father was the only parent to show up? Didn't these other children have families? It was like the story didn't want to delve into the supporting characters enough to make the story more realistic. A lot of actors were wasted to be honest. Chi McBride (X's father) is the backbone of X's homelife problems yet the man is on screen less than X's friends. Mike Epps is wasted though extremely hilarious as the neighborhood garbage man. The biggest waste was Nick Cannon's character, Benard. Anyone could have played this teeny part and it made me wonder if Cannon owed the director a favor since he was only shown about twice in the movie. And he was one of the funniest chracters! Jurnee Smollett was probably the most entertaining of X's friends because she wasn't wooden but vibrant and brought life to her character more than many in the film. I would have rather seen her as X's love interest. Bow Wow and Smollett's chemistry surpassed every scene Bow Wow had with Meagan Good by a long shot. And Meagan Good...well she just didn't fit. It was obvious that she is much older than Bow Wow and the others yet trying desperately to play the teenage role even though she looks thirty. It didn't work which left her character completely out of place. The actor who played Sweetness stole the show many times which made me wonder if his scenes were limited on purpose so he wouldn't show Bow Wow up. Sweetness's scenes were few but probably the best in the movie.

Also the writers needed to brush up on their 70's trends. Much of the dialogue used in the film was straight from today. I can't count how many times the characters said "" tripping "". I don't believe they said tripping in the 70's. The look of the 70's was done beautifully with the exception of Meagan Good who didn't look like she was anywhere near the 70's.

Don't expect much to be different mind you. Most of this story has been done before it's just that Roll Bounce added skating, disco and pushed us back to the 70's. Despite it being cliched this movie still stands up above many films that came out in 2005. Very entertaining. I recommend it to everyone. It's the perfect family film for people of all ages and races.

Also the best music of the 70's was played in this movie!",1156032000,3,3155,4.551056338028169
2441214,4,B000BTITFI,"Ok I hate to admit it but I kinda liked it.  I was annoyed that it took half of the movie to get to the really good skating, but all in all I would say this is a remake of ""You Got Served"" only with Better actors/acting, and a better story line.",1154563200,,245,3.7115384615384617

2441216,4,B000BTITFI,"I absolutely loved this movie.  It actually caused me to get goose bumps, during the skating sequences, and a popular hit came on, that I was very familiar with.

""Lil' Bow Wow"" (Sorry, I refuse to call him Bow Wow) was awesome!  His acting skills are very high.  No Academy Award performances, but still very good.  He really looked like somebody from the 70's.  Major kudos to the costume staff.  Great Retro 70's look throughout.  Including the old looking suit the father wore in his work scenes.  I also enjoyed the comedy relief of the garbage collectors.  Very funny!

I highly recommend buying this one.",1150416000,,611,4.723809523809524
2441217,3,B000BTITFI,"The opening statements in the director's commentary revealed a couple of key things. One thing that was revealed was that most Americans have roller skated at some point in their lives. The other thing that was revealed was how difficult it was to get the movie made. Why is it that a movie about an exciting activity would be such a hard sell to a movie company?

Roller skating isn't what it used to be. The time of the roller skating ring is quietly fading away with other such popular things of the 1970s, such as drive-thru movies and lava lamps. Of course, a movie based in the year 2006 about roller skating may have been an even tougher sell. This is why the movie ""Roll Bounce"" was based in the seventies.

The movie probably won't make you want to put on your skates and try the latest skating move. It fails in attempts to make roller skating look like the coolest thing on the block. However, it will bring back memories about a simpler time in life. This is because Bow Wow (known as X in the movie) and his friends have nothing better to do than run a newspaper route and go roller skating. The plot of the movie is simple and predictable. The movie is so simple that it garners the label of being a family friendly film quite easily.

The movie consists of three basic elements. Those elements are: your momma style jokes, roller skating moves, and the seventies. If you think you might enjoy two of the three elements then roll yourself on over to the video store to get this one.",1148169600,,1496,4.393501805054152

2441219,4,B000BTITFI,"I love this movie because it brings back memories of me going skating in the late 70's early 80's. Bow Wow (who surpised me with a very solid performance)impressed me along with a great ensemble cast from Chi Mc Bride playing his father with the right mix of toughness humor and senstivity, to his friends ( I wish I could name them all) and the young girls who played in Eve's Bayou to the humor of Mike Epps and Charlie Murphy. The way Malcolm Lee captured the period  was brillant (from the water ballons, t-shirts and clothes)  it  bought back memories for me from  street light and kids running in the house to the language. (not too dirty ) and my word to describe the ladies  in the late 70's ""chicks"". (not the word that passes for calling women today) And the skating is first rate and the editing looked very much like ""Woodstock"". I would recommend this movie for ""old skol folks "" who are tired of being insulted with movies like ""Soul Plane"", and  you can take the  young kids  without feeling dirty after you saw the picture, and sing along to the great music on screen.",1139788800,,1084,4.4120603015075375
2441220,4,B000BTITFI,"It is terribly unfortunate that Roll Bounce came and went to the theater without much notice. It is unfortunate, because it is the kind of film that people should be watching today. It is a heartwarming, life affirming film about five boyhood friends who want to do nothing more than be able to skate (roller not in line) at their favorite roller rink.

The time is somewhere around 1978 and the boys are all black. It's a black film right? Wrong!

The script is not unique in its overall direction, because we've seen similar in Saturday Night Fever and Rocky. While the roller skating could be equated with the dancing from S N Fever, the emotional context of this film share far more in line with Rocky.

The race of the characters has nothing to do with the film and yet it has everything to do with the film. Huh?

It has nothing to do with the film, because the characters are real, living and breathing people with real problems. And yet, there is no discussion of drugs, gangs, or guns. Oh there's a sexual aspect to the film, but of the ""wholesome"" variety. We see how young boys react to looking at beautiful girls and how men deal with being ""on the market"" to single women. It's funny and charming, not base or purile.

Race has everything to do with this film too, because it demonstrates that a film made by and for the black community doesn't have to rely on four letter words, sex, drugs, gangs, and guns to be good (Not one pimp or prostitute is present). It demonstrates that films of social significance can be made highlighting the best parts of the black community not the worst.

So what's it about?

Xavier - or X as his friends call him (Bow Wow) and his buddies are all avid roller skaters. Unfortunately their hangout - a roller rink - gets closed down. They must now travel to the north side of town, which is more white than their side of town. None of these boys are poor, but they don't come from wealthy families either - they're middle class. Yet when they arrive at the north side roller rink, many of the people there, including other black folks, treat them like trash. This is cause for the conflict in the film - rather than act like thugs, they do the Hollywood thing and challenge each other to a roller skating contest.

Their is a human element at work in this film that is leaps and bounds above most others. The boys rag on each other and talk bad about each other's mothers. It's all in good fun - and it's a heck of a lot of fun for us too. It's a drama with lots of comic touches - but first and foremost it's a roller skating film done the way they should have been when they were first made - actually back in the 1970's.

X's father (Chi McBride) is a highly educated man, but, in part, due to his race, he cannot get a decent job and is forced to take demeaning work in order to support his children (another emotional link in this film is that X's mother has recently passed away and no one has yet faced this reality fully).

The skating is dynamite and is fun to watch. The acting is top notch. Who knew that Bow Wow was as good an actor as he is?!

You can't miss with this film folks. I guarantee you'll like it.

It's as refreshing as anything you're likely to see in a very long time.",1139788800,18,3241,4.295081967213115
2441221,4,B000BTITFI,"Okay so I bought this movie when it first came out, but I was not too hyped about it. I just wanted to support African-american films.  I just never really wanted to watch it, but the first 5 minutes into the movie, it grabbed my attention. The movie was very colorful.  The music had and interesting mix of a 70s/disco feel to it.  I was diggin it.  The actors had a pretty goog chemistry with each other.  Bow Wow did an average acting job.  He still needs work.  But he did good.  I like the entire concept.  It wasn't your average : Contest-ghetto kids vs suburb kids movie where they need the money, or else something is gonna happen concept.  (like breakin, u got served, bring it on, etc).  Anyhow It was pretty humerous.  Nick Cannon, Wayne Brady, Charlie Murphy, Mike Epps, Meagan Good, McBride, They all did wonderful jobs in retaining the attention, and the theme of the movie.  What surprised me was the little girl from
Eve's Bayou, who used to play Michelle's friend on Full House.  This girl turned into a cutie.  U know she and Meagan Good also played in Eve's Bayou together.  I never thought about that. also Sweetness (AKA Jammal from saturday morning TNBC's City Guys) he played a very convincing role as Sweetness.  Obviously Arrogant, but with a confident charm. His first big role in a movie.  I thing he has a promising future in movies.  Overall, you feel like you really got a chance to know each character in this movie.  So you have more of an emotional attachment that grows on you as you continue to watch it. The Dance scenes were good, but you could clearly tell which actors were true skaters.

Being a 70's child myself the fashion, hairstyles, and music brought back a lot of cool memories and I found myself smiling a lot.

The relationship between X and his father, following his mother's untimely death added a serious aspect to the movie. Bow Wow has come into his own as an actor and was enjoyable and believable.

It was so funny to watch this movie because it brought back memories of childhood: skating, curfews, ""yo mama"" jokes...There is a joyful innocence about this movie which makes it endearing.

X, short for Xavier, has just lost his mom and is living with his dad and younger sister. Still not over the loss, he wears skates that are obviously worn out because it was a favorite gift given by his mom. X's world takes another shift when the local roller rink is closed down. Now, he and his friends must travel to the North Side to go to the Sweetwater roller rink.

At Sweetwater, their skating skills are tested by a group of kids led by the star skater of the city, Sweet...ness. Don't laugh when I write it that way, that's actually the way it's said and written in the film! X and his friends Boo, Naps, Junior, and another kid whose name I just forgot but who is known as the half-white kid in the movie (shame on them!) must come up with a new routine and prove their right to skate at Sweetwater. At the same time, X must continue to face the pain of his mother's death and his crumbling relationship with his father.

Overall, Roll Bounce was a very fun movie. The skating was unique and exciting and the soundtrak was a fun flashback to the 70's.

The only thing I wasn't comfortable with was the scene where Xavier confronts his father about the lie his father told (about his job and the location of their car). It was a little extreme in the context of the movie, though it did illustrate X's frustration with his father's apparent lack of emotion at the mother's death.

Still, the movie is pretty well rounded out and the acting was good, though the Sweet...ness character was over the top. I particularly enjoyed Bow Wow and Jurnee Smollett (Tori in the film). Roll Bounce is up-beat and makes you want to get up and dance or break out the skates. As a side note, I hope that the popularity of the film brings a resurgence of Roller rinks. Say ""yes"" to good fun!",1137283200,2,2225,4.36231884057971
2441225,5,B000BTITFI,"I really enjoyed this movie!  It took me back to my childhood, growing up in hoods where you weren't afraid to allow your children to go out and play for extended periods of time.  The part that really got me is when they looked up and the street lights were on.  LOL...My mother said the same thing, make sure your home before the street lights come on.  The music was fantastic, it made you wanna get up and move.  I give this one the thumbs up!",1137024000,4,447,4.151162790697675
2441226,5,B000BTITFI,"Man I had fun watching this little slice of the 70's, where cross-town rivalries were solved on the skatefloor instead of bullets whizzing by.  Its wholesome without being cheesy, although I could've done without the whole father/son soliquys.

Wayne Carter was great, as was Charlie Murphy, playing the role he always does.  Soundtrack alone makes it worth the viewing, and the sheer insanity of Mr. Sweetness is probably the star of the show.  He's so over-the-top, a complete nut.

Don't look for any life-changing moments here, but its a nice piece of cinematic junk-food.",1136937600,,576,5.085106382978723
2441227,3,B000BTITFI,This was a pleasant romp for those who group up in the70's and 80's. The songs and costumes complete the film and brought back good memories of my roller skating days. A family flick for sure. Not enough character development though. Focus on giving a glimpse of everything instead of developing a clear story line. You don't even see their skating abilities developing as the film leads to the finale.,1136678400,,402,4.757142857142857
2441228,4,B000BTITFI,"I Just love this movie i rented and than bought it. the whole plot was Great. I was brought up in a roller skating rink since i was a baby.  i started to skate at the age of 2 yrs old and now im 29 yrs old. my mom met my father(at my grandfather's skating rink) in the 70's.  My mom just told me she was roller skating when she was pragnet with my brother(32), sister(25) and I.  My grandfather owned a rink from the 70's through mid 80's.  This movie just brought soooooo many memories and my mom said she remembered that time with the music and skating moves ect.  We had a rink that was like SWEETWATER. We where called SHARKEY'S SKATEWAY (ROCHESTER NY). I wish my grandparents where alive now and still had the rink.  i would be there all the time.  i was just thinking i wanted to go back to a rink and start skating again..  I think if people never knew what it was like to be in a rink most of their life.  they won't like this movie.  but if you did you will soo understand the feeling of this movie.",1136419200,2,1008,4.045454545454546
2441229,5,B000BTITFI,"I had the pleasure of seeing this first in the theater and a second time as an in-flight movie. Seated next to me was a famous young rapper. Even though he'd been up more than 24 hours I suggested he try to stay awake for ""Roll Bounce"". This mega-star stayed riveted to every frame of this movie and we found ourselves laughing out loud in more than a dozen places. This is one great movie about a father and son trying to find their way after losing the most important person in their lives. It also happens to be the best roller skate movie ever made with the best shuffle skating you'd ever want to see.

Unfortunately, I need to warn parents about a couple of quick expletives that should have been removed and an unfortunate word reference by Epps in one his garbage man scenes. Other than that, ""Roll Bounce"" is one of 2005's best films - a worthwhile story for teens and parents alike.",1136073600,5,892,4.373493975903615

2441231,5,B000BTITFI,"I didn't get a chance to see it at the theaters, but I am so pleased I decided to buy it when it came out on DVD. I grew up in the 80's around  when roller skating was popular I used to love going to the roller derby. I am truly happy to see someone finally made a movie about roller skating. I think Bow Wow is a good actor and so was everyone else in this movie. Roll Bounce has drama mixed with comedy, and the soundtrack was good too.",1135468800,,438,3.8131868131868134
2441232,5,B000BTITFI,"I enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater but I honestly felt a bit skeptical about the ending. After receiving the DVD for a gift I can honestly say that I really appreciate this movie, it gives you laughs, action, and drama. Bow Wow really delivered and I felt that he did a powerful job in certain scenes that called for him to be emotional and angry. Over all Roll Bounce is a FEEL GOOD movie that will leave you smiling and dancing at the end! I encourage you to buy the DVD the Special features and Commentaries are great*",1135296000,,535,4.203883495145631
2441233,4,B000BTITFI,All I can say is that it's so nice when a movie actually makes you feel good.  What is it about movies that they can make the past feel like a better time than the present?  I'm an 80s child who wishes I could've had a bigger taste of the 70s.  This movie helps me do that and I really liked the flavor.,1134950400,2,303,3.7777777777777777
2441234,5,B000BTITFI,"I am not sure what I was expecting to see when I started watching ""Roll Bounce,"" but having Bow Wow star in a movie that combines the disco from ""Saturday Night Fever"" with the roller skates from ""Kansas City Bomber"" and the poignancy of ""Ice Castles"" was not even a remote possibility.  But that is the movie that director Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man"") and writer Norman Vance, Jr. (""Beauty Shop"") put together.  You knew that after ""Like Mike"" the day would come when Lil' Bow Wow would want to grow up, and that he did this movie will certainly help him make the transition.

""Roll Bounce"" is set in the 1970s during the disco era and starts off in the south side of Chicago.  That is where ""X"" (Bow Wow) and his friends hang out at the Palisades, the local skating rink.  But then it is shut down and their only option is to check out the Sweetwater rink on the north side of town.  In other words these kids are going to go from White Sox territory into Cub territory, and find things are different.  The place totally looks uptown and the cock of the walk is Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan), a disco roller skater whose male backup skaters announce his arrival and who has a trio of sexy ladies who worship him from up close and personal while the rest of the ground swoons at his every move.

Clearly at the climax of this movie X and his friends are going to take on Sweetness and his boys in the big disco roller skating contest.  But there are some other pertinent subplots that give this movie depth.  X's mother has died and he and his father, Curtis (Chi McBride) are having a contest to see if the boy misses his mother more than the husband misses his wife.  Complicating things are the fact that Curtis has lost his job, but is too proud to admit the fact.  Meanwhile, while X is friendly with Tori (Jurnee Smollett), the girl next door who might have braces on her teeth but can still carve up the boys with her tongue when they make lame jokes, he is attracted to Naomi (Meagan Good).  You would think there would be a standard adolescent love triangle here, but Tori thinks that X should date Naomi.  That is because Tori's mom, Vivian (Kellita Smith), shows up to yell at Curtis about something and he yells back, so if you think about it you know Tori and X will be living in the same house sometime after the credits roll.

I would think that the roller skating done by X and Sweetness at the end of the film is a lot better than what was actually happening at that time, but it is not like this coming of age film is trying to document such things.  One of the many things I liked about this film was that Sweetness is not just the bad guy, but he is really good at what he does.  He may have an oversized ego, but he has good reason to have one given what we see him do in this movie.  I would need Dick Button or Stacy Peralta or somebody to explain to me why one of these guys is better than the other because except for our rooting interest in X they look to me like they are both in a league of their own.  But before we get to the big skate off ""Roll Bounce"" pays its dues by treating the emotions of the characters seriously.  For me the pivotal scene is when X finally explodes and the violence does not begat more violence, not only because of Vance's script but also because of McBride's strong performance.  Violating expectations in a familiar storyline is always a good sign.

It really is amazing this movie was made and while I suppose it would be possible to write some sort of academic treatise on how the film subverts blaxplotation flicks of that period (not to mention the entire reign of disco), I would much rather prefer to just enjoy the film on its own terms.  All things considered, Bow Wow seems like a real kid, even when he is on the dance floor doing his thing, and this film avoids skating off into the land of perpetual stereotypes (try not to be distracted by thoughts of what other writers, directors and actors would have done with this film that would have turned it into just another forgettable comedy).  In the end I rounded up on this film simply because I would like to see the people who did this film make more in a similar vein.  Hey, it could happen.",1134864000,2,4216,4.292929292929293
2441235,5,B000BTITFI,"I just bought this DVD on December 13th and today is the 17th and I've probably watched it 10 times already. Various family members have watched it with me repeatedly because it's a feel-good movie. It makes you remember the innocence of youth and the times when you were unsure of what the future would bring. I enjoyed Bow Wow's portrayal so much and think if he ever wanted to give up rapping, acting would be a good job for him to flourish in.

Brandon Jackson as Junior was also excellent in this movie, as were the other group of boys who helped Xavier (Bow Wow) overcome the passing of his mother and the tension with his father. Xavier and Curtis (Chi) had great father-and-son chemistry and I hope to see them together in something else in the future.

It was nice seeing Meagan and Jurnee team up once again (Eve's Bayou being their first movie together) and enjoyed the fact that two girls hanging around the same boy could be friends and not jealous adversaries.

Kudos to Mike Epps and Charlie Murphy for bringing the laughs... the pair were great with the delivery of their lines and had me busting a gut everytime they were on. Ricky Gonzalez as Naps and Marcus T. Paulk as Boo and Khleo Thomas asWhite Mike were equally amusing and entertaining to watch.

And Wesley Jonathan was great as Sweetness. He didn't have many lines but the man is FIONE beyond words and has the sexiest lips and rock-hard chest! I loved how the girls and women went nuts whenever Sweetness appeared on the screen. Sweetness and Xavier's rivalry on skates was breathtaking to watch. The choreography was too much. I didn't know watching others roller skating could be just as fun as doing it yourself.

I sure wish we could get more African American movies like this. There was no shooting, no women being called derogatory names, and good soulful music making the movie a breath of fresh air. And the script was just plain fun, with heartbreaking moments, awkwardness between teenagers coming of age, and always kept a smile on my face.

I'd give this movie 10 stars if I could. The acting was great, the music wonderful, and never had a dull moment. Bow Wow and the gang has a winner here.

And who else remembered all-night skating whenever they showed the actors skating? It's been a while since I skated but this movie makes me want to go out and put on a pair and boogie oogie til I just can't boogie no more :)",1134777600,5,2409,4.524137931034483
2441236,5,B000BTITFI,"I was skeptical after seeing the movie trailer on the Apple web site.  The movie trailer looked good, but I figured that  this may be a case of where the trailer was better than the movie as is so common these days.

Well I was wrong.  Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Granted the acting was not top notch.  However, it was still good and believable.  The friends were believable and their friendship showed.

I especially enjoyed the skating and the walk down memory lane.  Reminded me of why I've always liked skating.

All right all you rollers out there, this is an all skate!  :-)",1134518400,3,583,4.509615384615385
2441237,5,B000BTITFI,"I loved this movie so much.  My friend April and I saw it in the theater when I visited San Diego and we stood up in the back row and danced and sang.  It was great!  It reminded us of the old days at Skateworld in San Diego.  We both were fortunate enough to skate at the ""real"" Palisades and Sweetwater Rinks which were/are actually in San Diego.  The memories this movie brought back are priceless.  Thank you and kudos to Norman Vance Jr.  This is my new favorite movie!  If you were a skater back in the 70's this is a MUST SEE movie for you.  Not only does it showcase great skating moves but has a very sweet story that goes along with it.  I laughed hysterically and also cried like a baby.  My DVD came in the mail today and I can't wait to watch it again.  Rent or buy it today.  You won't be sorry! Enjoy!",1134432000,3,816,4.025

We were the same age as the movie characters were in the 70s. Roller skating was a favorite past time. The characters remind me of the Fat Albert gang come to life. The clothes, hairstyles, and lingo were dead on 70s. All the elements for your dream skating rink are here. Thumping sound system, far out DJ, rexxing, kid-comedy antics in the rink, first love, best friends...Loved this movie! (one side note: The soundtrack for sale is NOT the soundtrack in the movie.

2441241,4,B000BTITFI,"I love movies like this, where the main purpose of the movie is to just entertain. The plot is simple, but it works.  You basically go through the life of Bow Wow's character from the point where his favorite skating place is closed down...and through the moments where he and his fellow friends get ready for a competition against the baddest (meaning good) skaters within the chicago area.

This movie brought back some old memories and the comraderie between bow wow and his friends are quite enjoyable to watch.

i was also pleasantly surprised by the fact that Bow Wow didn't annoy me in this movie because I fully expected him to. He's no oscar-ready actor, but he was a 100 times better than i would have ever imagined him to be.

The movie is alot of fun to watch and it's very family/kid friendly. I'll definitely buy this one and can't wait to watch it over and over. :)",1134172800,2,880,4.48125
