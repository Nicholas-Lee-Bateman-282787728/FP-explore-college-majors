3506397,5,B001C71IFQ,"It arrived fast and in perfect condition. I was very pleased. It had a lot of good episodes, but I had thought it was the whole first season. It only had some so now I have to wait for volume 2 to come out.",1226707200,2,206,3.7045454545454546
3506398,4,B001C71IFQ,"It's been five years since Ben Tennyson last wore the mysterious device, the Omnitrix (I think, perhaps, THE last time was in the live-action movie ""Ben 10: Race Against Time"").  Suddenly, Ben discovers that his Grandpa Max is missing.  Now he and Gwen, and even Ben's former nemesis Kevin Leven are on the search for Max, but a new alien race called the Highbreed are planning an invasion.  As Ben donned the Omnitrix back on his wrist, it suddenly changes into a new Omnitrix with ten or so brand-new alien heroes like the fiery plant Swampfire, the small but loud Echo Echo, the gargantuan Humoungousaur, and the fleet flier Jetray.

This DVD of the series continuation has the first five episodes plus the special feature ""10 in 10"" where you'll get some info on the new heroes.

So if you're a fan of Ben for quite some time, you'll really love this series.  And if so, look for more new episodes of ""Alien Force"" Friday nights on Cartoon Network along with other new shows ""The Secret Saturdays"" and ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"".  Plus, look for ""Ben 10 Alien Force: Vol. 2"" coming soon !",1226275200,,1089,4.582474226804123
3506399,1,B001C71IFQ,"It looks like the plan is to introduce Ben 10 Alien Force Season One in three volumes.  Volume one is 110 minutes so it probably has 5 episodes.  Volume 2 is 88 minutes so it is probably 4 episodes.  There were 13 episodes in the Season, so that leaves room for for a Volume 3 with the last 4 episodes.  Whatever happened to providing the entire season at once?",1225324800,23,361,4.188405797101449
3506400,4,B001C71IFQ,"Don't get me wrong, I love this show.  Ben10: Alien Force is one of the best new cartoons out there,  Ben 10: Alien Force picks up where the original Ben 10 series left off.  Ben 10: Alien Force chronicles Ben Tennysons life as a high school student and his new adventures as he once again dons the Omnitrix to battle evil aliens once again.

Thank goodness he matured, Ben and Gwen's constant arguments drove me crazy in the first series, so it's a relief that they don't argue much anymore.  Kevin Levin, Ben's former arch nemesis joins them for his own reasons and thus, the adventures begins.

The show's really great.  But I'd rather buy the full season and not volumes with only a few episodes.  That's the only reason I gave the DVD review four stars is that this series deserves a full season DVD set.

*Edit*

I have heard that Vol. 2 will be available in 2009, while it doesn't make me happy that they've split the season into 2 volumes, it is nice to know that it will come out soon.  I would still prefer a two-disc set with all the episodes in one place.",1220659200,8,1067,4.338383838383838

3506422,5,B001C71IFQ,"This season of Ben 10, he is at his best,he has so many aliens that I lost count. They are so much powerful then his aliens when he was a kid,and his powerful aliens can go beyond that and become so much stronger and that's only the beginnig of it. Kevin is still cool and funny,and Gwen's powers are the same. They still give Ben help every now and then,Oh and guest what he's famous now like Superman famous there's alot of stuff going on in this season when you watch one episode you'll want to watch the next one. This DVD has 10 Episode,1(Fame)everybody finds out that Ben is a superhero Kevin,Gwen try to find out who told everybody his secret. 2(Duped)Ben needs to be in three places at once,so he turns into Echo Echo and divides himself into three copies then turns back to Human and the result is three Ben's. 3(Hit'Em where they live)Some of Ben's villains team up and are targeting his parents. 4(Video Games)Now that Ben is a famous celebrity he gets a role in a video game but this game is not for everybody even Ben. 5(Escape From Aggregor)A turtle like alien is causing trouble in Bellwood but there's more to it. 6(Too Hot To Handle)Pandor an alien that is offering a huge reward to anyone who can break his containment suit,Kevin takes the job. 7(Andreas Fault)Argit is using a strong alien into forcing the Forever Knights into making him there leader,the Forever Knights may not agree with that. 8(Fused)After ambushing Ben at his house by a alien named Raad. He has been on the run from a very powerful person name Aggregor,Raad causes Ben's Ultimatrix to malfunction and puts him inside of it. 9(Hero Time)Ben saves actress Jennifer Nocturne from a group of thuges then a superhero named Captain Nemesis shows up but there's only one superhero in Bellwood. 10(Ultimate Aggregor)Aggregor tries to return home with five aliens in his possession to take there powers. A plumber damages his ship,so Aggregor tries to find and use Paradox's time machine but Ben isent going to let that happen.",1292112000,17,2010,4.6807909604519775

3506426,3,B001C71IFQ,"My son is a big ben 10 alien force fan, and he loves this dvd. The episodes are great, but this dvd seems to be a rip-off in my opinion. Why divide a season up into multiple dvds? This is a bit expensive for only 5 episodes.",1245110400,2,224,3.7872340425531914
3506427,5,B001C71IFQ,I really love the new Ben 10 series. Its more mature and it has better stories. I liked how they built up the main story throughout the entire season in addition to new stories each week. I have the full season on DVD and can't wait for the next season to start in June of 2009.

3506430,5,B001C71IFQ,"Picking up five years after the original series, We see Ben and Gwen and their friend Kevin during their early teens. Ben has let go of his omnitrix, so to speak, and is trying to live a normal life. Unbeknownst to Ben, a race of aliens called The Highbreed have secretly landed on Earth with the intentions of destroying the earth. Grampa Max sets out to stop them and comes up missing. Ben once again dons the Omnitrix in order to bring them down. The stakes are alot higher this time. The Omnitrix recalibrates itself to Ben's body, resulting in a new form, functions, and aliens to transform into. These first five episodes basically lay the groundwork  for what I've just told you. Ben does battle with new and old enemies, and even makes friends with children who have powers identical to Ben's. The only extra we're privy to is ""10 in 10"". A game to see if you can identify all of Ben's 10 Aliens. It's extremely lame and boring. Heck, the previous Ben 10 Season DVDs had better extras than this stuff. I'm really disappointed. Why no trivia, commentaries or interviews with cast and crew?? <sigh>

While I love the episodes and recommend them to you, it is beyond me why Cartoon Network & Warner Home Video would put so many episodes of a season onto DVD when we're in the midst of Season 2 now on TV and they could put all 13 episodes on DVD for us to buy like the previous show. To get more revenue from us, perhaps? Well, it ain't the first time that Warner has did this. They did it several times with episodes of Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond. Sad but true, this will probably turn off hardcore Ben 10 Alien Force fans from picking up any of the episodes at all. I know we're living in hard times, Warner, but we all got to work together to get through this. It'd be a sound decision to put all 13 episodes in one set, honestly. Fans would be more apt to purchase them. Trust me.

At any rate, if you've got the money to spare; pick up Season 1, Volume 1. Ben 10 Alien Force is alot more mature Ben 10 show that puts alot into its' stories. This is the show that got me to pick up the previous Ben 10 Seasons on DVD.",1231891200,14,2145,4.278325123152709
