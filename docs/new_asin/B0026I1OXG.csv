8352600,4,B0026I1OXG,We love the NEST videos.  Although they are too expensive.  This one is of course a little dark.  Great video if you are a Joan of Arc fan.  Also great if you want to explain the story of Joan of Arc to your kids.  Led to some great discussion about what it means to be a follower of God with my kids.,1363132800,,301,3.7903225806451615
8352601,4,B0026I1OXG,I picked it up for my Jr.high World History class. I use it as an incentive once the kids have read the text and listen to my lesson. They love it and it generates a lot of discussion.,1353283200,,184,3.8684210526315788
8352602,4,B0026I1OXG,We were very pleased to get this item shipped to our home so quickly.  We don't have anything but great things to say about the product other than my boys were having a hard time dealing with the fact as to what happened to Joan.  Great history lesson for us.,1340150400,,259,4.16
