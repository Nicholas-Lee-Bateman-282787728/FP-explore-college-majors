4009085,3,B002XJDUH6,"Can't do this one with the kids around! Usually they do my workout with me.  Moves might actually benefit them, but they don't really need all the talk about sexiness, etc.  Otherwise OK workout - a good change.",1275436800,,211,4.526315789473684
4009086,5,B002XJDUH6,"This DVD definately delivers what it says it does - in the striptease department!  It took a little getting used to because in order to really get my heartrate up, I really had to work moving the hips in BIG Circles, bottom sticking WAY out!  Luckily I do my workouts alone!  But it was definately fun variety and although it isn't a super intense cardio compared to some of the other Dance off the Inches workouts, it is enough for me for a lighter day.  I really like having something completely new in dance and the moves were easy enough to catch on anyone could do them.  Just make sure in purchasing this workout, that its all about slower, big movements that tone and get your heartrate going.  Its really not a fast paced workout.  The recent one by Bethany Lyons is a very fast-paced workout.  Unless you are prepared for this, you will have a hard time getting a good cardio in. But it is certainly doable for cardio, and what I like about this compared to some of the other striptease ones I've tried is that it is structured very well, similar to all the other Dance off the Inches DVDs.  And I love to do dances that are structured well and that give the opportunity to keep my cardio going for at least 30 minutes.  I will do this one again and again, because, well, I just can't resist the fun factor and the lower half really getting toned.  The backup dancers were a good choice for this DVD also.  One could definately be a ""pro"" striptease dancer, and the other one showed that it's just plain good 'ole fun.",1265760000,5,1527,4.3568904593639575
4009087,4,B002XJDUH6,"This video was not as intense a workout as I would have liked, but it does offer some decent toning moves for your lower body and core.  There's not much in the way of cardio or any upper body toning, but the moves were fun and a good change of pace from just doing boring squats and lunges.  The instructor was a little annoying, mostly because she does strange things with her face in an attempt to be sexy, but I could get over this.  My main complaint is that the moves aren't really worked together into any kind of routine the way that I am used to from other Dance Off the Inches DVDs or other dance workout dvds I have purchased.  Had they done this, the workout would have been a little longer and more cohesive and also increased the cardio level which would make it perfect.  But again, this dvd does not disappoint in terms of fun, sexy moves.  Overall, I like this dvd and will keep it as a fun alternative for lower body toning on days that I don't want the intensity of my Jillian Michaels or Jackie Warner workouts.",1265587200,14,1031,4.2615384615384615
4009088,5,B002XJDUH6,"I love this video!! It is great for the uncoordinated, as they go through each move and then build upon them to make up a routine. Probably designed more for the beginner or someone who is not as comfortable with dance. Which is perfect for me! It is fun and I am going to be looking for more ""Dance off the inches"" videos!",1327968000,,323,4.142857142857143
4009089,4,B002XJDUH6,"I have many of the Dance of the Inches DVD's this one is pretty low key but once you know it you can add a little more pep to the steps.  Overall it's a fun workout that flies by.  I agree with another review that you don't really learn any ""stripper"" moves, but it's a fun dance dvd for a lighter day.",1326931200,2,302,3.8548387096774195
4009090,5,B002XJDUH6,"Being a long time fan of watching workout videos,this is at or near the top ever. This lead brunette is gorgeous from head to toe,with a great voice and personality. Megan's hip work is smokin hot and she likes to work it. Her top gets more and more sheer as she sweats a bit and her beautiful breast are visible. Megan does a wonderful job working that backside out as she says and I agree. The cool down is long and very hot. Megan performs gorgeous hip circles and really gets into it. As in the cool down and every other chapter,she performs lots of hot moves and then proceeds to repeat them over and over. If you like watching a beautiful and talanted woman ""Push it Out"", this is a must see.",1322524800,,698,4.2556390977443606
4009091,1,B002XJDUH6,I tried this video and I felt like a wannabe cheerleader. To be the dance wasn't at all seductive or even a good workout. A huge waste of money!,1321315200,3,144,4.0
4009092,3,B002XJDUH6,Its ok but if I could go back I would. Its only good for lowwwww key working out. Some of the moves are ok but mostly funny. Its like once it starts to get going and get good it stops and goes back to the same steps over and over. The instructor did the best she could with the material. If you want to break a sweat this isn't for you. I will keep this as a keeping in reference tool more than a CARDIO striptease. Beginners striptease mayyybe just without the cardio.,1318550400,3,469,4.053763440860215
4009093,1,B002XJDUH6,"None of the moves are done in a slow, sexy, graceful way. The only stripper-like move was the pretending to take your shirt off bit. The only moves that were sexy (although they were not done very sexily in the video) are available in the Sexy Moves for the Nightclub series which is also a better workout. The video was cheesy and funny and if you have ever been to a strip club in your life you will not recognize anything here. It is actually more tame than the nightclub dance series I mentioned with an extra helping of goofy. I'm sorry, but if I buy something with ""striptease"" in the title I expect to come out of it feeling like I learned some beautiful, sexy, graceful stripper moves, not some quick, goofy, jerky, aerobic wannabe nightclub attempts at movement. Another DISAPPOINTING fake striptease workout.",1300060800,6,818,4.6482758620689655
4009094,5,B002XJDUH6,This dvd had great moves and good instruction. The moves are broken down so you can learn at your own pace. It is a good workout and is really fun. This is a great buy.,1288137600,,168,3.8285714285714287
4009095,3,B002XJDUH6,This video did have me sweating by the end but it was kind of cheesy. The moves could have used some extra spice and the instructor was pretty anoying. Overall it was alright. I really like dance videos compared to traditional arobics but there are better out there. I will keep using it to change up my workout but not my favorite.,1286150400,,332,4.370967741935484
4009096,5,B002XJDUH6,"I did not expect to like this routine as much as I did. I have tried a couple other striptease videos and felt either uncoordinated or silly. This one is very good! There is a 20 minute tutorial section if you want to learn the steps first but I didn't use it. I jumped right in and it was not too hard to follow and it really does make you feel sexy, but equally important, that you actually got a workout. I was sweating a bit but smiling the whole way through. I even did the ""sexy cool down"". I usually don't do cool downs in the dvd's because I am too impatient but this one was fun!

In general it is broken down like this:

Warm up - 5 minutes (consists of sexy warm up moves)

Cardio striptease (consists of 1. Work it, 2. Too hot too handle  3. Total tease) 30 minutes -It really is cardio but not tough like an aerobic workout.

Cool down- about 8 min (slow sexy moves that you put together)

Unless you choose a specific chapter in the cardio striptease it goes on through them without seeming like you are now entering a new chapter. I did not realize it had those chapters because I just selected play all in the beginning. I can't see myself only doing one chapter because it was fun all the way through but it's a nice option if you want a quick workout.

Finally, I would like to say I was definitely not feeling sexy before I started the video. Actually feeling tired and unsexy.  But a few minutes into it and I was. Your moves don't have to be perfect, and she doesn't say silly annoying things. She and her two assistants are cute and the music is very nice too. The set is also nice and not distracting. I will definitely be doing this one again and keeping it.

Finally, for the person who rated this 3 stars because it's not really suitable to do in front of kids,  well, it says striptease so I'm not sure why she expected to feel comfortable doing it in front of them. I'm glad I ignored that. This DVD delivers exactly what it says and is the most fun of the DVD's in my exercise library. Moms, don't let the title and dance deter you. Do it when you can have privacy for a little bit. Start to finish is 43 minutes and you can make it shorter by choosing a chapter or two if you want. All women need to make themselves feel sexy from time to time. This should do it!",1282003200,26,2293,4.132584269662921
4009097,4,B002XJDUH6,"This w/o is fun.  I'm choreographically challenged, but I had no problems following this.  It's not a hard w/o, so I will save this for days when I don't feel like working out.",1275868800,3,176,4.303030303030303
8383724,5,B002XJDUH6,"I wanted to try something different to get me motivated more. I put off working out, but this is pretty fun to do. I don't know if I need to add anything besides this but, it a nice change compared to what I have done. I just need to be better at picking up the steps, it's not hard at all.",1457913600,2,290,3.7704918032786887

8383726,4,B002XJDUH6,This is a fun light work out to do on days you don't want to work out.,1427587200,,70,3.176470588235294
8383727,4,B002XJDUH6,"Enjoyable, I stopped at 25 min cuZ it felt like it was dragging on. I'll keep it for days when I don't feel like working out",1422921600,,124,3.8076923076923075
8383728,1,B002XJDUH6,"This is hands down, the absolute worst workout video I have ever seen! Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't borrow it, don't waste your time!!! I literally turned it off after 25 minutes and have never looked back. What a joke. You won't break a sweat & you won't get a workout, but you will stand in one spot & ""move sexy in place"" for an obnoxiously long time. Not a cardio workout! Not an instructional striptease! With so many great workout videos on the market, I'm appalled that this one has such a high rating on amazon! Try T25, or Jillian michaels, or minna Lessig, or really anything but this if you're looking for a suffuciant at home workout.",1422057600,,652,4.396694214876033

8383730,5,B002XJDUH6,"great way to practice these moves for some dance classes that I take (Megan is the instructor on the DVD, as well as the instructor to the classes I take locally. She's an awesome teacher/person!).",1415577600,3,197,4.6571428571428575
8383731,2,B002XJDUH6,This DVD really didn't make me feel sexy working out or teach me anything that my husband would find attractive. I also really didn't feel like I got a good work out from the DVD. I just felt silly.,1361836800,,198,4.102564102564102
8383732,3,B002XJDUH6,"I tried this DVD last night. It was kind of fun but I'm guessing it felt sexier than it actually looked when I did it. There is enough variation in moves that it doesn't feel too repetitive and because it has a ""moves guide"" where you can learn more slowly the things you aren't catching onto quickly enough, it won't feel too instructional once you know all the moves. Many ""dance routine"" workouts are very boring once I already know the routine. This is good enough to keep in my workout DVD rotation because it's different, but, I wouldn't plan to repeat it more than once every few weeks or so. Don't buy this DVD expecting to learn to do any kind of real strip tease routine. This DVD is a more silly-""sexy"" flavor than anything near ""how to be a stripper."" The instructor is only slightly annoying, but, the background girls lack any kind of personality. I didn't break much of a sweat and I was purposely moving with big motions and hip rotations to try and work my heart rate up higher. Definitely NOT any kind of intense calorie burn. Overall this is, okay. But I'm guessing there are probably better ""strip tease"" type work outs available.",1330473600,2,1150,4.507177033492823
8383733,5,B002XJDUH6,I've been using this DVD for a week. The routines are simple to follow and you definitely get a good workout and feel as sexy as ever!,1329955200,,134,4.0
