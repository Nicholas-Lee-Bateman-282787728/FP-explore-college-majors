7908299,4,B00000FEKT,"""The Telephone"" is yet another excellent entry in the landmark PBS documentary series, ""The American Experience.""  More than just a dry summary of how Alexander Graham Bell invented and marketed the  telephone, this film puts Bell's invention in its proper context.  The  documentary also explores the unique working relationship between Bell and  his partner Thomas Watson.  As the film shows, Bell could formulate an  idea, and Watson could make it real.  This documentary does not stop with  the phone's invention, but illustrates Bell's struggle to prove he was the  telephone's actual inventor and details his efforts to turn the telephone  from a novelty to a necessity.  In just one hour, this film runs the range  of the phone's invention to its widespread proliferation.
Archival  footage and the personal journal entries of Bell and Watson add to the  drama and authenticity of the story.  The documentary includes an old  interview with Thomas Watson recounting the famous, but widely disputed,  story of Bell summoning him over the first working phone after Bell spilled  acid on his arm.  Although this story probably didn't happen as recounted,  it's part of the legend of the telephone, and seeing Watson tell it is  fascinating.  This is a well-researched, illuminating, and highly  entertaining documentary.",956534400,5,1324,5.285024154589372
