8695786,4,B00RQYJTI2,"A good movie, but not a great one. Although well written, acted, and presented, it was all expected. It's saving grace is that it's not ""just"" a kids movie. It's written for adults as much as for the young folk. It's a story about baseball first, and the moral lesson comes after. It's predictable, but you end up cheering to watch the moral lesson unfold. Not at all sappy, it holds your interest from start to finish. And in the end, boys and heroes all win.",1495238400,,460,4.3604651162790695
