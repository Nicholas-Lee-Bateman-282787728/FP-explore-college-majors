8237852,5,B0010HOZGW,"Although Critter Friends is not as good as Little Friends and Little Adventurers, I love this DVD!  Little Playdates is on to something with these videos.  They keep the attention of my young children allowing me to get some things done around the house that I wouldn't normally be able to.  5 stars in my book!!",1312848000,,312,4.535714285714286

8237854,5,B0010HOZGW,"What a wonderful, fascinating video for babies and toddlers who love animals!  My 14 month old and I snuggled on the couch during a bout of the flu and it was the FIRST thing to make her smile in days!  We were SO thankful for this mesmerizing video!  She is a little animal lover and is definitely engaged by all the interesting animals, not to mention the adorable children.  The music is great and we love to dance along with the video.  Definitely one of the best baby/toddler videos out there and I would recommend this as a gift or for your little ones!

If you are not familiar with the Little Playdates Series, these videos help to teach positive social interactions between children by showing babies/children playing together in unique learning environments (as opposed to animation).  These videos can also help expose children to diversity and are great for children of all backgrounds and equally great for boys and girls!  Truly a positive influence on our little ones!  This video in particular also helps to expose children to a variety of animals, and helps them learn to be gentle towards animals through numerous examples!

Critter Friends is our favorite of the Little Playdates Series so far- we can't wait for more!!!!",1215388800,,1240,4.806603773584905
