936900,5,630486387X,I enjoy these first three movies by the Ocean dub as they follow the original script. I think this is the closet english dub to the first three movies we'll ever get. They have great voice acting and the original music. I have all three movies and I had to order this one but it was worth it.,1255046400,,292,4.051724137931035
936901,5,630486387X,"This Dragon Ball Z movie is totally awsome. My opinion is that this is the best one. Even better than The Worlds Strongest, and the others. this movie is definatley a great movie to add to a dragonball z collcetion. comment and please rate. thanks for reading.",1246060800,2,260,4.553191489361702
936902,5,630486387X,"I am a huge fan of the Dragon Ball Z show, these videos are a must for anyone who likes a little extra action and can't get enough of the total non-stop adventure from Goku and friends.

I loved the video, it is compared to the most creative cartoons around.",1128211200,,258,4.16

936904,5,630486387X,"Love, love, love this movie. Blows me away almost every time I see it. Obviously the title of this review refers to its visual superiority, and that's exactly what it has, in almost every facet. It's puzzling why some people allude to this film as having mediocre animation, because frankly, I think it dazzles in that department. It's on par with any other DBZ movie visually, and that includes ""The Return of Cooler,"" which I believe to be the best of the DBZ movies animation-wise. Maybe I just have awful taste in what looks good, or perhaps I just have no grasp on what good, clean, crisp animation looks like. Who knows really? All I know is that my eyes love what they see when I pop this in the DVD player.

The fight scenes are a little sparse and take some time to get to (I happen to like that, but not a lot of people do), but they're more than worth the wait. There's about a 15 second sequence after Turles takes a bite out of a piece of fruit from the Tree of Might that's about one of the sweetest animated action scenes I've ever seen in my life.

Although I love the way it looks, the sound is pretty delightful in its own right. Pioneer does a good job with dubbing. They leave it relatively untouched and close to its original form, and I like the Pioneer voices a lot better than FUNimation's, especially Piccolo's and Vegeta's.

The sound effects are nice and crystal clear, and I happen to prefer the original score for all DBZ films and episodes, though some of it gets repetitive. I don't really take to a lot of the music that some of these western companies have added, though mainly it's because there's just too damn much of it! I love how in the original form of this anime, there are many points of pure silence, accompanied by only wind whirling in the background or the sounds of the inside of a spaceship. Also, FUNimation and Pioneer (mostly FUNimation) just can't seem to appreciate a scene where no one's supposed to be talking. In the Japanese versions, there are many scenes in which they'll be showing the back of someone's head or their eyes or something and they're completely silent, but FUNimation/Pioneer feels it's incumbent upon them to throw in some voice and it ends up sounding really forced and generic. You never know what type of ambiance silence can create until you watch one of these FUNimation produced movies/episodes in which they just bombard you with music and dialogue non-stop.

Anyway, apart from the impressive visuals and good sound, the story's pretty average, but that's expected since none of the DBZ movies are meant to be linear with the actual plot of the series, rather just side projects done for fun and entertainment purposes. This is why I don't judge these by their storylines/plots, mainly just animation, presentation and general badassedness. This movie excels in all three, so buy it!",1097193600,6,2866,4.613725490196078
936905,2,630486387X,"I was very dissapointed in this DBZ movie. All the things i love about the tv series were missing. I love the long drawn out grueling battles in the series but here they are all over in seconds. The dialogue was pretty poor and the story line very thin,explaining nothing about Turless or his origins. I also hated Gokus voice in this movie. And why oh Why is this movie so short?If even an extra half an hour on were added onto it to beef out the story line and add some much needed action and fight scenes it could have been so much better.",1071273600,,542,4.171428571428572
936906,4,630486387X,"Goku and friends battle it out against the evil Turlis whose the 2nd brother of Goku(his first is Raditz in the series). Turlis grows the tree of might that will detroy the world, Turlis eats the fruit and he is buffer and stronger then ever. great action with Goku, Tien, Piccolo, Gohan, Yamch, Chotzu and Krillin trying to save earth from the evil clutches of Turlis and theres a cool fight against Monkey Gohan and Goku. hold on",1066262400,2,431,4.538461538461538
936907,3,630486387X,The movie followed along the Dragonball Z theme.  Evil does wants to destroy earth.  Goku and friends fights ever one falls even Goku but he doesn't stay down.  Goku saves the day.  The movie is good don't get me wrong I just wished there was more fighting.,1042588800,,257,4.404255319148936
936908,4,630486387X,"This is an example of a cool movie that really doesn't fit anywhere in the universe.  The story revolves around an evil Sayin named Turles who along with his group of pirates plants the Tree of Might on earth.  The tree sole purpose is to drain the planet of it's energy into fruit which can power up a character to double his strength at that time.  Goku, KRillin, Yamcha, Tien, and CHaotzu all arrive to try and destroy the tree.  They are then ambushed and the battle begins.  Later Gohan and Piccolo show up and the battle heats up even more.
Eventually it comes down to GOku and TUrles and in the end the spirit bomb is used to finish him off.
THis movie doesn't really fit into the univeres for the following reasons.
1:The story takes place between Sayin and Namek.
2:Goku was hospitalized at this time, Krillin and Gohan were in space, and Tien, Yamcha, CHiatzu, and Piccolo were dead.
SO as you can see this movie takes place in a subuniverse of the series.  It doesn't fit into any particular story line but is still cool non the less.",1039219200,,1045,4.416666666666667
936950,5,630486387X,"This is one of the best dragon ball z movies yet!
It's quite short but the action & suspense make it a lot better!!!
It starts off with gohan, krilin & bulma camping until a fire sets out on the forest, and gohan wishes the forest to be back to normal again with the dragon ball's!!
Then a space pirate named turles who look's just like goku plants the tree of might on earth & is sucking the energy out of earth into fruit!!!
He then turn's gohan into a giant gorrilla and goku cuts of his tail to turn him back into a human!!
Then turles eat's the fruit from the tree of might and challenges goku in a fight to the death!!

936952,4,630486387X,"Personally I think this one is the best of the DBZ movies, great action and everything, but it doesnt really explain much about Goku's evil twin, Turles (hey I don't know how to spell Japenese names). Where did he come from, if only Goku, Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz survived their home planet's explosion? Who are those freaky lackies: the alien guy with boosters to move him, the huge Indian chief guy, the teen with the ponytail? The movie's action is great, and you don't really pay much attention to explanations, but I still think they should've explained it better. Oh yeah, I think Goku's evil twin looks cooler than him ^_^",994982400,,630,4.684684684684685
936973,4,630486387X,"This vid was a really good movie. Though it wasn't as good as worlds strongest, it still rokked. If I could i would of given ita 4 and a half star rating because the action was really good. the plot was really interesting, and u could really follow along with the storyline easily. the only thing i disliked about is that there trying to be funnyall through the movie, though most people don't care for dbz's comedy, and just want to see peoples back sides kicked. also, they toned down the fighting so that younger audiences could enjoy the movie too, but personally, i think dbz should be for teenz and up. basically if u were a dbz fan u should definatly get this title, cos it is entertaining enough to suit older fans and younger fanz. if ur not much of a db fan, u should rent it first.",992563200,,792,4.286666666666667

936975,5,630486387X,This has to be one of the best Dragonballz movies of all time. The reason for this is that it involves all of the Z warriors in an emotional and amazing fight with the enemy and there leader looks like the strongest saiyan around. The movie is about these space pirates that come to earth and plant the tree. This sucks all the life out of the living things on earth in order to grow a special fruit which makes to person who eats it extremely strong.

936977,3,630486387X,"Don't get you're hopes up with this one.  The movie starts off with a probe of some sort landing on the earth, causing a fire that destroys a forest.  The heroes use the dragon balls to wish the forest back.  Aliens arrive, the heroes fight them, it ends with the main villian gaining much more power than even Goku, then Goku becomes even more powerful than him, kills him, end of story.  The original version of this movie is okay, it's fun to watch at times, fun to fast forward at others.  This english dub only makes it worse.  There are parts where the dialog really drags, other parts where small snipets appear to have been cut out.  I believe this is uncut, so that is a plus.  It soars above the cut version shown on cable, but it still lacks compared to the previous movie, ""The Worlds Strongest"".  The only downside The Worlds Strongest had was a corny story.  This one not only has that, but an odd enemy that makes no sense with the main storyline, and used fight scenes.  The animation doesn't seem to be of any higher quality than the series.  Music is good, MUCH better than the crap used in the Dubbed series.  Best scene: Goku using the kaio ken attack killing several enemies.  Worst Scene: restoring the forest with the dragon balls.  If you have to get it, get the DVD so you can watch it subtitled the way it was meant to be seen.  All in all if you're a DBZ fan you should see it, but buying it may not be a good choice.  If you're an anime fan all in all, you might want to pass this one up.",979516800,,1516,4.208333333333333
936978,5,630486387X,"This is the best DBZ Video ever, coming from a DbZ fAn. The movie sorta started off on the boring side, but it got much better!! After Turles started talked talking about Goku and how he was a weakling, i knew this was about to get action pakked! When King Kai was talking about the Earth coming to an end, Goku got really mad, and everybody agreed to fight off the TrEe Of MiGhT, although cHi-cHi had a problem with Gohan fighting like always because of his ""StUdIeS"". They all went to the tree and did blasts on it together, but it didn't do anything. Turles finds Gohan fighting and turns him into a GiAnT mOnKeY by making a moon out of one of his blasts. After Gohan turns into the giant ape, he quickly blasts off the moon so he won't transform too. Gohan quickly turns on turles and startes fighting him when Goku cut off his tail. Which makes him fall naked on the ground. Goku catches him before he falls into the water and promises him that he will defeat Turles and the TrEe Of MiGhT. This movie is also the first apperence of Ikkorice (in the movie hes called HiGhEr DrAgOn). I think this movie is really action pakked, and funny because of the hillarious caroonish pics of Gohan's ...",975024000,,1196,4.34375
936979,4,630486387X,"This is the first time i have watched Dragon Ball, and needless to say, i had great expectations. i was very worried after a couple of minutes  because of the child-like story and humor in the beginning, but it soon  gets better... sooo much better.
 I only own a few anime videos because  90% of the anime market seems to be shitty. While the best ones are pure  genius, but i must say, none of these have quite as cool fights as Three of  might.  Im usually not into video violence, but the persons and the action  are just so spectacular, that im now officially a Dragonball Z fan.  - now  i just have to figure out how to afford all the episodes in uncut version  which can be difficult when you live in Denmark  (yikes!)

936980,5,630486387X,"I honestly feel that Pioneer does a MUCH better job at dubbing than FUNimation.  Not only was this movie only available in uncut format, but  the fact that they don't butcher the script by adding really pathetic  jokes.  It was nice to hear the original opening and original background  music.
The plot was rather well developed, and I jumped when I heard  Turles' line: ""Who the hell are you?"".  I had to rewind to make  sure I wasn't hearing things.  I would have prefered the movie to be just a  little bit longer, but the silence in this movie really added a lot of  suspense.

Otherwise it has a perfect plot, cool charaters, and some awesome  scenes like when Gohan trasforms into the Mammoth Ape and trys to kill  Goku.

The  movie had a good plot to the story but not much fighting... ~*BUT the  (little) profanity and HuMoRoUs nudity make up for it*~ If you want action  i wouldn't really recomend getting this, but if you want a somewhat-comedy,  this would better suit you or if you're just a so called *newbie* (kinda  like me) it would also be a great item to add to your soon-to-grow DB  collection.",946425600,8,826,4.489932885906041

937032,5,630486387X,"This movie is tight as hell. The fight scenes are great and the sound effects are perfect. I thought it was interesting that Turles looked just like Goku however, the problem with that is the fact that Goku and Turles's  similiar looks raised unanswered questions. Since they did not show  anything about Turles's origin (besides the fact that he's a saiya-jin)  they really shouldn't have made Turles look like Goku in the first place.  One more complaint: I wish that their was a complete hand-to-hand fight  between Turles and Goku instead of Goku just ending it with a Spirit Bomb.  In conclusion, it is true that some things are done the way I wouldn't want  them to be done but it is still a great movie and I am glad I bought it.

What I think was good about this movie is that it had  better animation than the TV show, and had bad guys who are even more  bulkier than than Gokou and Tian combined.

7878832,5,630486387X,"This is the 3rd DBZ movie. It features Peter Kelamis (Rolf from Ed, Edd, and Eddy) as Goku.

When Earth is attacked by a Saiyan (Turles) and his group of alien henchmen, Goku and his friends must rise up to protect their home.
Turles carries seeds to a life-sucking plant called the ""Tree Of Might"". This planet absorbs a planet's resources (thus making the planet inhabitable) and produces the fruit of might. This fruit gives the consumer overwhelming power. Will Goku and his friends be able to save the planet Earth? Buy this movie and see.

This movie is a prime example of early animation at its finest. The sound and video is perfect as is it the original Japanese audio complimented by a great dubbing team (Ocean Group). This was one of the first animated Dragon Ball films that was featured on Toonami Friday Night movies alongside The World's Strongest and Dead Zone.

This is definitely a collectors item (for old school DBZ fans or even anime fans in general).

If you are looking for this specific version; make sure to contact the seller and ask if it is the exact same product as pictured. The product I received is the one as pictured and is mostly distinguishable by the ""Pioneer"" in the top right.

I love Dragon Ball Z. but theirs something i have to address and that's the very fact that this movie has a time paradox. here are the examples. watching this movie due to gohan's appearance and a few other indicators that this movie takes place before planet namek and the battle with frieza because turles even states that ""with the tree of might he will be even more powerful than frieza"" present tense frieza is still alive. so if this is the case and Goku knows both the spirit bomb and kei-o-ken which he learned before coming back from the dead to fight vegeta while Piccolo, Chiaotzu, Tien and Yamcha were all dead then why are they in this movie? its like the writer wasn't keeping the movie in the same universe as DBZ but thats debunked because ""The Dead Zone"" was apart of the DBZ universe since theirs an arch in the show about Garlic Jr. returning from the dead zone. the reason this problem has pushed the movie so far back for me is because its false information like it never even happened in the DBZ universe and having to think about this every time i watch this that one huge problem sticks out detracting from enjoyment.",1370476800,,1183,4.506976744186047
