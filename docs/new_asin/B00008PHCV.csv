1856771,3,B00008PHCV,"The contents of this package rates five stars, but what drags it down to three is that Rhino created a fancy package and short-changed the public on the amount of episodes they put in the package. I mean SIX episodes in a three-DVD set for [that amount]? Come on Rhino! You could easily have put 12 episodes in this set. After all, there were 144 episodes of Laugh-In. At 12 episodes a set, it would takes years to release them all on DVD. Now it's going to take twice as long.
Aside from all that, the episodes are great and the picture and sound are crisp and clear. The interviews aren't bad either.
So Rhino, enjoy your Fickle Finger of Fate. I'll be thinking twice before I shell out {good money]for six more episodes of Laugh-In.",1056585600,205,735,4.411764705882353

1856798,3,B00008PHCV,"The Best of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1968) is very good--but only as far as it goes. This three DVD set wastes space on the discs; we only get a few episodes and even then I strongly suspect that one or two of these episodes were trimmed down a little. The picture quality is excellent, admittedly; and the sound is good. We get three bonus interviews (one on each of the three DVDs) with Gary Owns, Ruth Buzzi and Arte Johnson.

The jokes are very funny; Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In took huge risks for its time to make audiences howl with laughter. I remember it was a big deal if we children were allowed to watch it! These episodes give us the famous Lily Tomlin act as Ernestine the telephone operator, the swinger's party were jokes with many innuendos were told ostensibly off the cuff; and the dialogue between Rowan and Martin themselves is very well written and performed.

There are several celebrity sightings on these DVDs; I liked Tiny Tim despite the fact that his act was rather bizarre; and the episode on DVD number three includes the full show that guest starred Jack Benny. Jack Benny fits in perfectly on this show; he tells jokes and gets set-up by the regular cast of Laugh-In with hilarious results.

The regular cast never fails to pitch out those jokes that even today have some very funny punch lines. Look for Goldie Hawn, Alan Sues, Judy Carne, Jo Anne Worley and Lily Tomlin (among others) to make the shows here on DVD very entertaining and funny.

Unfortunately, my main gripe (and it's a big one) is that there's just not enough here. Where are all the other shows from the first two seasons? Why do we get only four or five episodes at the most here? This is very disappointing and I will take off two stars for this flaw to make this a three star review.

Overall, Laugh-In was hilarious. This three DVD set proves it. Unfortunately, what we get is so good it can frustrate me--and others--that we didn't get so much more from the first season or two. Hopefully Rhino will eventually see the light and produce a proper retrospective of this fine series complete on DVD. This is even too short to be called a ""best of"" Laugh-In DVD set.

You get TWO lousy episodes (49 min each) per disc. There are three discs so that's a total of SIX episodes only.... What's going on here guys...There is only ONE excuse for this pricing structure, pure greed.

Packaging is great, the quality of the program is not bad (not brilliant either), yet they're charging $45 for 6 episodes, with some extras. What a rip, considering you can buy the ENITIRE season of .... let's see... I'll just pick ANY series, here's one, Magnum PI (1st season). For under $20, you get FOUR DOUBLE sided discs with 1113 minutes of footage. Rhino gives you 3, SINGLE SIDED discs, with only 294 minutes for more than DOUBLE the cost. It's not worth it guys. Rhino do this often to make HUGE profits. Don't buy this DVD until the greedy execs at Rhino lower the price. If no-one buys it, they'll have to. It's a shame a decent company didn't pick this great series up.

1856804,3,B00008PHCV,"In the late 1960's, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In was an entertainment of sight gags,  skits and one liners. It was Vaudville, Burlesque  and low brow humor combined in an hour of TV

This DVD of six episodes fully takes in what the show had to offer. You could call this DVD A taste of Laugh-In.  It captures  in a nutshell what Laugh-in was.

You will note, in the late 80's, NBC (the same network that Laugh-In was on) came up with  Saturday Night Live. It  took up Laugh-In mantle without the joke wall or the quick SOCK IT TO ME!

However, This small piece of the show on DVD isn't much, we need more! I rate it low, because it feels so incomplete...and for what it worth, it better to have NOTHING than a small taste of greatness

I would rather have a full season of Laugh-in. Since Rhino isn't making many DVDs lately...someone should!

Some of the skits were a little nutty, and there was some political humor that even now eludes me, but overall, this show was hysterical and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip down memory lane.  Goldie Hawn, Henry Gibson, Lily Tomlin, Artie Johnson, Dave Madden, Ruth Buzzy, JoAnn Worley, Judy Carne, Alan Sues, Gary Owens and the rest of the cast, all the special guests, and of course Dan Rowan and Dick Martin presented a laugh fest I looked forward to every week in my youth, and I very much appreciated to opportunity to enjoy it again, and now whenever I want, plus I can share it both with those who used to watch and those who've never had the chance.

He seems more-or-less pleased with the episodes included, but doesn't think it's worth what I payed (he saw the receipt).

Even today, it's still as hip, fresh and lively as it was when it first hit the airwaves in 1968 (I was born 3 years later.) That's why the DVD sets are so incomplete. All it does is leave you hungry for more. Why aren't they released season by season? That's the common packaging nowadays. I would love to have the entire 1969-70 season, which is my favorite. There are too many good episodes missing, ones that I remember from the Nick at Nite days. For example, what about the one with Carroll 'O Connor from Christmas time 1971, in his only appearance on the show? Or, the 100th episode, which included John Wayne and Tiny Tim, plus the return of Judy Carne, Joanne Worley and Teresa Graves? The episode which featured Three Dog Night singing their big hit ""Joy to the World"" during the cocktail party scene is also another goodie that's missing. Makes me regret not having taped these shows years ago. BTW, if anyone has any ""Laugh-In"" shows on video, please contact me! All we have to talk about is the price...

Bad jokes? Yes, although Rowan & Martin's stand-up & Lily Tomlin's sketches still make me laugh. Silly slapstick? Yes. But I didn't really buy this DVD to laugh; I bought it to smile, and it does not disappoint. There are lots of little things here to warm the hearts of baby boomers, such as Dan wearing a peace symbol on his lapel. If other generations don't get it, that's OK.

In a nutshell? It's an interesting cultural experience - to see what people were talking about, laughing about. It's more political that I'd expected, and there are some very stylish elements. The packaging is also fun!

Having said that, I never need to see another episode of Laugh-In. I have never heard such bad jokes on a show, or seen such relentlessly terrible slapstick. Sure, they offer disclaimers about how bad the jokes are, but it doesn't help. Fabulous comedic talents wasted in 7-second skits.

1856819,5,B00008PHCV,"Good lord there are just too many people complaining about the fact that ""Laugh-In"" was ""topical"" on this site (as if that was a bad thing). The same folks probably hoo-hah with laughter when ""The Simpsons"" parody ""American Idol"" (how do you think that'll hold up on the topicality scale in 30-plus years kiddies?) So let's get this straight: ""Laugh-In"" is, was and always will be a priceless and epochal combination of humor ""ripped from the headlines"" (of its time) and the last gasp of vaudeville.
That's right - vaudeville. Because while the editing in ""Laugh-In"" is straight out of the French New Wave, the rythm of the humor is pure Borscht Belt. No joke is too low, no cow is too sacred, and that's why this is a priceless buy for any of you kids out there in TV land. ""Laugh-In"" was to its tumultuous era what Michael Moore is to ours: a forum that was willing to take aim and name names. It was funny and it was courageous, and it deserves to be celebrated for all the brilliant humor it still possesses.
For those who decry the shows ""dated"" references, let me just say: Listen, punk, go buy yourself a history book. ""Laugh-In"" is inviting you to reflect upon the most significant era of modern American history (the 60s, which defined the America of today as surely as the Civil War did the America of the 1880s), and if you're too lazy to Google what they mean when they say ""Mai Lai"" on the show, you shouldn't be writing reviews on Amazon in the first place.

That is what happens when a show's humor is mostly topical. Jokes about Lyndon Johnson, birth control, and Viet Nam fall flatter than a pancake today. Then there are the large number of pointless one liners, short dumb sketches, scenes that go on too long, etc. This now seems about as hip as a Nehru jacket and love beads. Simply awful. You also know that a supposedly radical ""youth"" show has lost its sense of identity when it starts having lounge lizards such as Joey Bishop and Sammy Davis as guest stars.

Now I can fully appreciate this show from its ""heyday"" period (when I was ""old  enough""--circa 1971--producer George Schlatter was practically pressured out).

Believe me, the visually boring""innovations"" of Norman Lear (""All In The Family,"" ""The Jeffersons"") are a fraud in comparison to the provocative stuff that Dan Rowan, Dick Martin, George Schlatter & the gang could do every week.  And what a cavalcade of great comedic talent!  Do we have ANYONE today who can measure up to Jo Anne Worley, Alan Sues, Arte Johnson, and Ruth Buzzi?",1065312000,8,947,4.9245283018867925
1856834,4,B00008PHCV,for it's time Period this Show was cutting edge&dealt with alot of topics.a wide range of guests came on board for the fun. Goldie Hawn has always been Fly to Me.some really funny stuff.,1063497600,,186,4.5
1856835,4,B00008PHCV,"Are these episodes really uncut?  There is a weird edit in which Zsa Zsa Gabor is cut off before saying anything, and in one episode, Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall are introduced at the opening credits, then never seen again.  Just asking...",1062547200,5,242,4.738095238095238
1856836,4,B00008PHCV,"They could have squeezed a bit more onto each DVD. Only 6 episodes in a 3 DVD set? I have The Monkess Season One set and with 6 DVD's they fit 32! I know that these shows are longer but really not by much sans the commercials. All in all though I am thrilled to have these finally ""uncut"" on DVD! I don't have the ""Trio"" network, which airs them so, this was a relief!
Dan & Dick are probally the best ""funny/straight man"" duo of all time. I hope Volume 2 is packed more!",1060300800,4,471,3.968421052631579
1856837,2,B00008PHCV,"With the current trend of issuing television series in complete seasons, and maximizing the content included on a DVD, there is absolutely no reason for consumers to accept product that gives them less than their full value for their money.  There is easily enough space on a DVD for over three hours of material.  Minus the commercials, it is common to have four ""hour"" long episodes on a single DVD.
Why is it that ""The Best of Laugh-In"", a three DVD set, contains just a total of six episodes?  This is VHS type packaging, and is comparable to how the original Star Trek TV program was offered on DVD years ago.  We've come far beyond that.  The price for this set is exorbitant as well.  You could get the complete season of a series like MASH or All in the Family for less.  The title of this set is also misleading.  Rather than being a ""best of"" compilation, it is actually a collection of six complete episodes.
Laugh-In is a great program, one that broke new ground, and was highly innovative and influential.  It is certainly worthy of much better treatment.  Rhino usually provides value, in whatever they issue, however this time they have clearly ""socked it"" to the customer.  Rhino needs to understand that this type of packing is not acceptable, and is really an insult to the consumer.  Just say ""no"" to this set, any maybe they will get the message.",1058400000,855,1366,4.576131687242798
1856838,5,B00008PHCV,"Before SNL, SCTV or Fridays there was ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh In"". A show featuring split-second & side splitting humor. It often features special guest stars---like Richard Nixon (Sock it to me?) Jack Benny, & Sammy Davis Jr. (Here comes da judge)
Starring Arte Johnson, Ruth Buzzi, Lily Tomlin and many more. Verrry interesting!",1057968000,4,330,5.12962962962963
1856839,5,B00008PHCV,"For six years, I watched Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In on Monday nights. I enjoyed it because it was funny, with catchphrases like ""Sock it to me,"" ""You bet your sweet bippy,"" and ""Here comes da judge"" performed by an ensemble cast of comedians including Goldie Hawn, Lily Tomlin, Ruth Buzzi and Arte Johnson. I haven't seen this show for several years, so I bought this DVD as soon as I saw it. This DVD has two episodes from each of the first three seasons and they're just as funny today as they were when they first came out. They even have the show in which Richard Nixon asked ""Sock it to ME?"" I'm hoping that Rhino puts every season out on DVD in box sets so that those of us who watched it can enjoy it again and those of us who never saw it can watch it and enjoy it. This DVD set has a delightful bonus - the three discs in the set has interviews with Gary Owens, Ruth Buzzi and Arte Johnson, respectively, where they discuss how they were hired for the show and discuss how they worked on the show. Creator and producer George Schlatter also explains the genesis of the show and says that there might be a Laugh-In 2004 and there is a pictoral recration of the joke wall with pictures of the regulars saying the lines they made famous. It's well worth the price and is a look back at a piece of television and comedic history. Buy it.",1056931200,142,1343,4.25
1856840,4,B00008PHCV,"Finally! A television show from the 60's on dvd that isn't British! Laugh-in was the first program I can remember getting special dispensation to stay up late on a school night to watch! Some of the then topical references to vietnam and embarassing Indian jokes  now come across as alternately clumsy, dated and painful.  One skit involved Cher as Pochahontas and Tim Conway as John Smith. Dan Rowan adressing Cher; ""Pochahontas?"", Tim Conway interrupting replies, ""Yes I do"". Im stunned it got past the censors back then!. However, the brisk pace, the ""mod"" soundtrack, Goldie Hawn go-go dancing, old burlesque and even vaudville ""black-out' gags, lots of guest stars, and, well,did I mention Goldie Hawn go-go dancing?!...all make for an entertaining bit of eye candy. Tons of catch phrases were born of this show; ""sock it to me"", ""here comes da judge"", ""verrry interesting"", even ""Say goodnight, Dick"" was a throw back to the old Burns and Allen TV show, and everything  still seemed to work when I viewed this show in it's entirety for the first time since the 70's. Did you know that Seasame Street was 'inspired"" by the Laugh-in format? And wasn't Hee-haw a ""country-fied"" version of beautiful dowtown Burbank's most famous step-child?Steal a bunch of old gags from vaudville, Ernie Kovacks and who knows where else, slap some psychadelic paint on it, label it ""Laugh-in"" and it somehow seemed fresh! Still does. Did I mention Goldie Hawn go- go dancing? My only negative on this dvd collection is the lack of any real extras. Three interviews are included with three cast members, but no out takes, promos etc. I still reccommend this collection highly, and urge Rhino video to release more volumes soon!  The dvd even includes the old NBC peacock intro promising that the following show is ""In living color""!The video transfer looks excellent. Psychadelica Americana- Look THAT up in your Funk and Wagnell!",1056844800,15,1916,4.996865203761756
1856841,4,B00008PHCV,"It's great to see my old childhood favorite again after all these years.  The transfer is great, the interviews are really interesting also.  The packaging is amusing also - but Rhino, couldn't you have been more generous with episodes?  Two episodes per disc at that price is a little outrageous - when you really could have made it a better bargain - and a much better ""Best Of"" collection. Let's see more episodes per set next time, huh?  The recent ""Xena, Warrior Princess"" set or any of the Dark Shadows series have no problem filling out their discs with excellent quality and excellent value.",1056758400,8,599,4.730769230769231

There you will see [in honor of the 50th anniversary;] a new BEST OF COLLECTION. That's what I did after I saw the infomercial for it. But when I arrived, got off of my tricycle, and went inside the store, I ended up not purchasing it. Instead, I wound up purchasing something I wasn't expecting to see: THE COMPLETE SERIES!! I realized how pricey it is, [and I rarely splurge like that with dvds. I remember doing this once before, but I can't remember for which show.] For those that want to ""take the plunge"" like I did, I highly recommend  doing so. It can be paid off on monthly installments, which is what convinced to go on ahead and purchase the show. The box is nice, and so far what I have seen of the episodes, and the discs, there is no skipping, and the transfers/copies of them are pristine. I have not viewed all of the discs/episodes yet, But I am hoping when I do, it will turn out to be more of the same.
