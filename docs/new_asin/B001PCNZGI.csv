3747056,3,B001PCNZGI,"I'm a huge Philip Glass fan but I think that would make me harder on this film than the average music fan. I know so much about his work, it's harder to surprise me. But this two hour documentary by Scott Hicks does a great job of capturing the remarkably diverse work that Glass is creating, from solo concerts to operas to film scores to symphonies. And the bonus DVD contains three hours of extras including some complete performances, chats with composers he's mentoring like Nico Muhly and much more.

3747057,3,B001PCNZGI,"Not quite satisfying because it may reveal too much. Glass's music takes me to another place, and demystifying the man does not help me better appreciate his art. Still, I'm glad I saw it and the extra features on disc two are great for multiple viewings.

Oh, and would someone please get Mr. Glass a proper pizza cutter for his cottage in Nova Scotia. Cutting pizza with a knife?",1243209600,,381,4.521739130434782
3747058,2,B001PCNZGI,"I like Philip Glass.  I like his music, and I like him as a person.  I've actually met him, and he seems genuinely approachable and down-to-earth.  However, this documentary just isn't worth watching, even if you are a devotee of Mr. Glass's work.  You see Philip chatting with friends, Philip cooking, Philip with his kids.  You meet his family.  Et cetera, et cetera.  There was a German TV documentary made about Philip Glass a few years ago that was more watchable than this film, because it was less ambitious; you saw Philip at home and Philip at work, and the whole thing lasted about an hour.  At roughly two hours, this film is just complete 'overkill'.  Mr. Glass is one of the most successful composers of the 20th/21st century, but his daily routine is not signficiantly more eventful than the lot of the typical New York intellectual/professional artist.  Even Glass's occasional comments on art and the artistic process seem ploddingly pedestrian, though it must be admitted that he is generally distracted when he makes these comments; he's watching the kids, or the food, or whatever.  Admittedly, it must be an exhausting experience to have someone follow you around for days with a movie camera, capturing your every move.  I've seen interviews in which Philip Glass provides some remarkable insight into the world of art and the role of the artist in society.  Here, the anecdotes get mixed in with the usual flotsam of daily life, and frankly, it's not enough to sustain viewer interest across two whole hours.",1243036800,13,1530,4.883720930232558
3747059,5,B001PCNZGI,"This is an absolutely incredible film.

It's an intimate look at the creative process and creative collaboration--and that includes the lively interaction between the filmmaker and his subjects, among whom are some of the most  accomplished people in contemporary art and cinema.

It is also a visually gorgeous, beautifully edited film that includes among its subjects several Glass theatre pieces which are stunningly beautiful.

Best of all, Philip Glass turns out to be a wonderfully warm-hearted, endearing human being who has led, and continues to lead, a life that fully embraces all of life's possibilities--at the age of 70.",1242432000,14,633,5.363636363636363
3747060,5,B001PCNZGI,"I will start off by saying that I'm a huge Philip Glass fan- I've been to over 50 Glass concerts of all types since 1988 and have an extensive collection of Glass memorabilia as well.  I've had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Glass on several occasions.

This movie is essential viewing for anyone interested in music and creativity.  Mr. Glass is a genius; a music ""machine"" who is incredibly prolific and obsessed with music composition.  He's a human being too, as the film vividly illustrates.  He is simply an amazing man yet struggles with the demands of life as all of us do, as the ending of the film makes clear.

Scott Hicks, who has directed the films ""Shine"" and ""No Reservations"" among others, is a fan of Mr. Glass and followed Mr. Glass around the world for approximately two years as he worked on composing his Symphony No. 8, toured his work for the Philip Glass Ensemble and world musicians called ""Orion"", and premiered his opera ""Waiting for the Barbarians"" in Erfurt, Germany.

There is simply so much in this movie that I can't go into all of it here.  I first saw the movie at the Sarasota Film Festival and it was shown on PBS TV as part of the ""American Masters"" series in April of this year.

Even if you don't like Glass's music, this movie will carry you along for an exploration into an incredible artist.  This movie is just like Glass's music- multi-dimensional, out of the ordinary, beautiful, humorous, spiritual, and haunting.  The cinematography is also superior to ordinary documentaries.  It's fast paced and could have easily been much longer.  Also includes a second DVD which includes outtakes, extended interviews with Glass, performance clips from the incredible work ""Orion"", and Glass performing ""Metamporphosis"" on piano in concert.  A remarkable portrait of the greatest living composer!",1242086400,8,1829,4.858064516129033
3747061,5,B001PCNZGI,"Saw this amazing doco last night. Its an incisive two hour window into how one of the most iconic composers does his thriving. Some key insights:
1. If you are not upsetting someone then you're not doing your craft -  Craft is about letting your uniqueness come through ;
2. Its not about contribution (though, of course, you really do);
3. The craft speaks to something that really enrichs his life
If you only use trued and true tools and techniques then thats all you will produce ;
4. ""Big things"" emerge - its like being under ground and hearing an underground river somewhere. Instead of directly looking for it, you do your routines and you sink in the time - the river finds you and takes you where it is going - you are the vehicle and it (for Philip the new music) was always there ;
5. It is your life - have a portfolio of activities that craddle your uniqueness - for him this is various moving meditations and exercises with different masters, family life, being a New Yorker - doing the evryday stuff and routines - With the portfolio of mediations/exercise/spiritual practices, you look for new practices that fill in gaps or open new possibilities ;
6. It is your life - surround yourself with a network of gifted very different individuals, and have regular quality time with them
7. It is your life - shape the quality of it by the environments you inhabit and move between - for him its the buzz and life of NYC, coupled to the farm wilderness type enviornment he and Holly have on the Nova Scotia coast;
8. Learn and evolve from lots of very different teachers - from the harsh formal piano mistress in Paris to the loving approach used by Ravi Shankar
When you do your craft you just make the quality time, be there, support yourself with the habits and it comes. Have lots of projects on the go at any one time
9. The craft is ""communicating"" - for him its through music, painters its their art - the key is how to ingest this - for music being great at ""listening"", visual arts through ""seeing"". Passive - active going on here
10. It is your life - Moving between the Nova Scotia coast and NYC environments and live ""young"" - His much younger wife Holly, and family life with kids under 5 - he turned seventy in 2005 but appears to live with the energy and drive of someone half his age

Oh, and yes, there is his music and projects sprinkled throughout it that really add to the tone and meaning of it...",1239926400,24,2429,4.395555555555555
3747072,4,B001PCNZGI,"This is a very insightful documentary on one of the best modern classical composers, Philip Glass. loved the interviews with his wife (it was funny when she's talking about PG going out to the desert with some guru he follows, presumbly in some psychedelic-induced state)",1360540800,,271,5.044444444444444
3747073,2,B001PCNZGI,"I looked forward to watching this movie because I love Philip Glass's music and I was hoping for something along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/32-Short-Films-About-Glenn-Gould/dp/B0000544LY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">32 Short Films About Glenn Gould</a>. I was disappointed to find that this was just a soap opera posing as a documentary, dominated by details about Glass's deteriorating relationship with his trophy wife -- although it is more likely that he was the glamorous trophy spouse for a shallow and conventional woman who obviously did not understand him.  Or perhaps it was just the filmmakers' own bias that made the wife so unsympathetic. In any case, I actually lost a lot of respect for Glass as a result of this film. Not recommended.",1317945600,,809,5.8559322033898304
3747074,4,B001PCNZGI,"This two disc set of American composer Philip Glass reveals an interesting and complex man. His music has a haunting
quality about it, that is hard to dismiss. I highly recommend this set to anyone who has an interest in the composer.",1303257600,,234,4.595238095238095
3747075,5,B001PCNZGI,"From the excellent and critically minded reviews of this DVD, I would say that when mine arrives I am in for a geniune treat. I have studied the music and personality of Glass over the years, observed the impact of his music on my college-age students, and relished his soundtracks in recent film releases. From humble beginnings Glass emerges as one of America's prime exponents of minimalism, a late 20th century musical trend that is still fireing the minds of musicians everywhere.

DVD arrived, viewed the entire presentation. Wonderful mix of Glass's music and biographical scenes of him over an 18 month period, along with historic footage of his music-making and family situations. A complicated man whose music rises above traditional fare. You won't be disappointed in this DVD investment.",1298678400,5,799,5.1461538461538465
3747076,5,B001PCNZGI,Not just a great documentary - but incredible that they caught such an interesting sub-story of what was happening in his marriage.,1293494400,,131,5.0
3747077,5,B001PCNZGI,"This is the documentary that recently aired
on the PBS series American Masters. This is
a terrific insight to the mind of such a
brilliant and multi-faceted person. Not only
does Glass come off as intriguing, but
self-effacing and humble. You will learn
about his background in music as well
as his upbringing, family, and spiritual
pursuits. The interviews are candid and
witty. As a composer myself I found this
very inspiring, but one does not need
to be a musician to appreciate. For those
that have seen the doc on PBS already it's
still worth it with all the bonus footage
on the second disc. You get about an
hour and a half of the leftover interviews
and about the same in live performances.

A must have for Glass fans!",1259971200,6,728,4.557251908396947
3747078,5,B001PCNZGI,Phillip Glass never disappoints!  This portrait belongs in the American archive of artists in America in anyones collection.  I really enjoyed the film and I learned more about music and process.,1259625600,,195,5.258064516129032
3747079,3,B001PCNZGI,"I don't quite know how, but Scott Hicks has made Philip Glass look boring. He spent many months with the composer, gaining exclusive access to his professional and personal life, and yet rarely manages to penetrate beyond the surface to find out what makes the man tick. The film starts off with a long and rather tedious anecdote told by an old friend about the olden days when Glass and co were really shaking up the staid world of music in the 1960s. We then flit from here to there and in the process we see far too much of Glass pottering around in his Nova Scotia cottage cooking and generally interacting with friends and family. So what? We want to learn something deeper about the man. Glass talks (or rather, he mumbles, which is another problem with the film) about himself and is occasionally insightful. He clearly lives for his music and everyone and everything comes a distant second. At the end of the two hours you ask ""Is that really it?"" We barely see him perform. The most personal part of the film comes when his fourth wife Holly almost breaks down in front of the camera, admitting that while the marriage worked for a while, the two of them are now drifting apart. It comes as no surprise to learn that they have separated (this is not mentioned in the film). Although I'm perhaps being unfair to suggest that Hicks had a chance of unlocking the soul of a very complicated man, I think he could have asked some more pressing questions.",1249344000,8,1459,4.509433962264151
3747080,5,B001PCNZGI,"There are two major documentaries out on Philip Glass that I have seen. One, this one, and another one that was released on DVD a couple of years or so before this one.

The previous documentary was interesting in its own right, but I felt it focused too heavily on actual performances, the actual music and very little on Glass as a person. Those who have a deep affinity for Glass' music were likely to already know most of the info and insights seen on that documentary; I know it provided very little insight or new material for me having followed Glass and his music for some time. After I had seen that older documentary I was left wondering if we would ever truly see into Glass as a person and as a human being. I wondered that until this film was released.

""Glass: A Portrait of Philip in Twelve Parts"" went well into everything about Glass as I had hoped. As an artistic-minded person myself and one who has obsessed over Glass' music for the majority of my life, I had longed to truly see what there was to Glass himself beyond the notes on the page. Just seeing the trailer for this film was a treat and I waited very impatiently for its release and it was worth every moment of the wait.

This documentary gave us so many looks at Glass both figuratively and literally and I never wanted the film to end. From his children and his wife (and previous ones), to his home(s), to his traveling for performances, to his meeting of friends and other artists, to his going over scores with Davies combined with segments showing his everyday life and looking at his approach and the processes of his composing made for a fabulous, satisfying film. What you end up with is a whole portrait of the composer from both the personal and artistic points of view.

The only surprise to me as far as something not included in this film was more about the PGE (Philip Glass Ensemble) and hearing from it's members. However, this is something the other documentary covers a little more in-depth than this one, and this is about Glass after all (not the ensemble), so we don't get much more than a few obligatory mentions of them in this film. Other than that it far surpassed anything I thought would ever be seen of Glass as a person.

The surprise that came to me upon seeing the film was my expectations of 'who' Glass would be. Growing up as a kind of dark, angst-ridden, artsy, music-majoring teen who first felt a connection to his music when I heard Glass for the first time ('Koyaanisqatsi'), I have always expected him to be a darker, intense, avant-garde minded, hardened, semi-cynical person based on what I heard in his early works. While he is no less intense or creative than I imagined, if you are expecting what I was I think you will be in for a surprise. And while I now see the reality of who Glass is rather than what I had always expected, I think of him and his music no less than I did before-and that is the beauty of this film, of Glass and of his amazing music.",1249171200,3,2983,4.406533575317605
3747081,5,B001PCNZGI,"I feel I've just spent a year with Glass (the biopic covers a year) and I've fallen in love with his life.  I want to be him!  I want his gifts of music and hard work, his friends (who obviously love him), his kids, his summer house, and I long to watch him make pizza from scratch while talking about composition and then -- eat as much as I can hold.  What a LIKABLE man (even his siblings like him).  I've always appreciated his music--it's like English grammar, subject, subject, verb, object. It's one of those films you live inside as you're watching it--I recommend it.",1248912000,4,576,4.40566037735849

8333067,4,B001PCNZGI,"What a lovely documentary about composer Philip Glass done primarily by one photographer and a sound tech. You get a peek inside Woody Allen's edit room, visit with the painter, Chuck Closs, and see how an opera is put together. If you are a fan of Philip Glass or a little bit interested in the man and his work, this is a fine move to see.

8333068,5,B001PCNZGI,"If you are a big Philip Glass fan like I am, or you have never heard of him -- oh, I suppose that's a possibility -- then this documentary probably offers the best insight into his life, aesthetic and compositional style. His interview during which he discusses composing, etc., is superb, perhaps even better than any ""discussions"" in his other books!

Superb!",1409097600,2,361,4.82258064516129

8333070,5,B001PCNZGI,"This movie is just like spending time with Phillip Glass, in his home, with his friends and family, etc. seeing bits of him outside his music, (yes, he is just a person,) but brilliant, of course, but kind, down to earth mixed in with genius. No, he does not walk on water.  He is married, has kids, parents, makes and eats pizza, has his eccentricities, has suffered loss, has struggled, and probably still does.  It's wonderful he has opened up to us, in his big hearted way, to share himself this way, so we can learn more about his music, where it comes from, how he works, and more about ""genius's.""  Something about him and his music and this movie causes me to think that we all have this potential, somewhere, if we can access it. It's inspiring.  I am as touched by the movie as I am expanded by all of his music, and it's about this ordinary person who is an extraordinary person, too.",1404864000,4,895,4.373493975903615
8333071,5,B001PCNZGI,"I caught this when it was broadcast on PBS.  Although I have been trying to understand and comprehend his music for years, this is exactly what intrigues me about Glass.  I found many areas of the documentary fascinating but there were two in particular I wanted to point out.

First, when asked where his creativity comes from, he mentions twice in the video that he thinks of his creativity as a river running under where he is and all he needs to do is tap into it.

Second, he discusses the opera of which is nearing it's first performance and he himself did not know what the main idea of the work until the end and seems to still be comprehending the meaning.  He seems to let things unravel themselves until they are made known to him.

Glass appears approachable as a human being.  Gracious with his friends and good natured.  His fourth wife was very blunt, open and honest with her feelings about the marriage and I can't say I was surprised.  Glass seems to get into a zone when he is working and he seems to stay in that zone and perhaps detached from the world.  I think true artists do lose sense of space and time when they are creating.

Enjoyed the production, but didn't want to give out too many spoilers.",1404518400,,1224,4.395555555555555
8333072,5,B001PCNZGI,"This DVD set unfolds the creative stages of composer Philip Glasss life in music and the muses who have inspired him. The magnificence of his art speaks for itself here, but this DVD set also lets the composer explain how it happened.  His muses speak directly to the viewer about their experience on the creative journey with him.  In my opinion, the honesty of Glass himself and his muses is intimate and helpful to other couples or buddies on a creative journey albeit in different roles.  Knowing about the difficulties or illusions encountered is enormously helpful in maturing on a journey of our own.",1399075200,,607,4.8173076923076925
8333073,2,B001PCNZGI,"There are a great many scenes where we see the day to day activities of Glass life that are not so much unenlightening as they are not fun to watch. The musings of an aging baby boomer with aging baby boomer proclivities such as a flirtation with buddhism and a strict vegetarian diet (ugh) provide no insight into Glass' creative process or music. Nor is his day to day domestic routine terribly interesting. What there is about Glass' creative life, such as his conversations with artist Chuck Close, or discussions about his interest in Indian music, is occasionally informative and interesting, though it sometimes seems more like nostalgic rambling about the good old days or just dinner party prattle. The documentary ultimately became too tiresome for me and I turned the movie off two thirds in. Theres no story here. Glass' art is in his music and not his life.",1369958400,4,870,4.806666666666667
