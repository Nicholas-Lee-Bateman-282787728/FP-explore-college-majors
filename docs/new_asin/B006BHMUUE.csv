I did not even know linkedin had the features it had and the video brings them all to light.  Recommend for job seekers and just people looking to network.",1334620800,,288,4.107142857142857
4982417,5,B006BHMUUE,"Joshua Waldman's ""Getting the Right Job with Social Media"" is outstanding.  It is to the point and very easy to understand.  The main focus is action plans to ensure your LinkedIn site is complete and it helps you to network with companies in which you may want to be employed. I feel fortunate to have listened to this video. Wendy Packard",1333843200,,340,4.557377049180328

Joshua Waldman has a wonderful way of de-mystifying the use of social media in the job search. He is able to look at the methodology and logic used by hiring managers and translate that into a winning action plan. I like Waldman's approach because it simplifies the sometimes vaunting task of organizing for the job hunt. Each section of the CD speaks to a specific point and breaks  the actions into individual steps. He models the type of language most effective in a world where hiring managers make a yes/no decision on a resume in less than 30 seconds. The videos on the CD visualize each important point with well thought out graphics. I recommend Waldman's video to anyone trying to advance their job search through the use of social media.",1333324800,,961,5.713286713286713
4982419,4,B006BHMUUE,"Excellent video on how to leverage LinkedIn for your job search, as is Joshua's new book.  Once you know what you want, then he reveals a simple yet powerful strategy for zeroing in on target companies and more importantly people in that company. Love his genuineness and emphasis on transparency and authenticity.",1333324800,,314,5.038461538461538
8496081,5,B006BHMUUE,"Joshua has a great way of taking information and presenting it in a simple, yet realistic way.  He is insightful and provides the step by step method of using social media in a positive way to gain the right results for job seekers.  I highly recommend this DVD!",1357776000,,262,4.4375
8496082,5,B006BHMUUE,"I have been absorbing Joshua's free content for just under a year now, and I always learned at least one new tip or trick that helped in my internship and job search. Now, I had the opportunity to purchase this content at a discount and I was quite surprised. I expected to learn one or two new things, but my tally is up to eight, and I consider myself an advanced social media user. The Twitter ""chapter"" is less advanced than the Linkedin and Facebook portions, but I understand why this was done. Twitter is STILL not used as much as Linkedin and Facebook for recruiting, but that is a changing trend.

Regardless, I highly recommend this DVD, as well as other content from Joshua. I have never been disappointed with his tips, and this DVD provided significant value for money. A job well done!",1337040000,,799,4.510344827586207
8496083,4,B006BHMUUE,"If you are interested in using LinkedIn, the benefit of which Waldman makes a clear argument for, this resource is a must-have to put things in perspective and give you a proper game plan. I really do not care for the arbitrary, people-oriented ""rat race"" of getting good employment, but this DVD gave me confidence in playing the networking game to get noticed for what I have to offer to businesses. My main concern is what the intended audience is. I can't imagine this DVD's information is immediately helpful for just anyone, say, for instance, a high school student with no experience struggling to find work, but then again I guess it is implied that this video is for people in the ""career stage"" of their life; and for them, it is probably worth it to buy this. Also, I would have liked if the content were not so industry agnostic; not all industries are alike  in hiring practices. For example, not all businesses are like, say, the mostly merit-based hiring of Silicon Valley and the IT industry.",1335744000,,1008,4.662921348314606
8496084,5,B006BHMUUE,"This Portland social media guru has a detailed, researched & easily digestable presentation for how today's job seeker can be successful in the new labor marketplace. His succinct & insightful tips will speed up your job search, increase your networking ability, enhance your online reputation and offer employment success, when followed. I highly recommend both his book & dvd formats.",1335744000,,386,5.45
8496085,5,B006BHMUUE,"One of the best aspects of this video is how to craft your LinkedIn profile in the most effective manner -- one that represents you accurately and presents a good impression. I had never heard of the option to show an ""Amazon Reading List"" on your profile before. This is a great way to let future employers to know that what concerns them interests you, and that you keep up-to-date with your field. It also lets some of your personality come through. I bought Waldman's book ""Job Searching with Social Media for Dummies"" after watching this dvd and am glad I did. I feel much more confident facing a job search in today's market after watching and reading these steps to success.",1335657600,,681,4.590163934426229
8496086,4,B006BHMUUE,"Joshua Waldman does a great job to help job searchers understand the nuances of finding a new job by leveraging social media. He covers the most popular platforms and gives insightful advice on how to improve your profile, stand out and get noticed. I thoroughly enjoyed this video as well as all of Joshua's work. I purchased his book ""Job Searching with Social Media for Dummies"" and highly recommend it as it is packed with valuable information. It's easy to find things that are important to you as well as to implement in your job search campaign.",1335398400,,552,4.701030927835052
8496087,5,B006BHMUUE,"I have done Career Coaching for over ten years and find the information that Joshua provides in this DVD to be extremely informative and useful right away after viewing.  He gives a step by step approach to establishing your ""brand"" using social media and how to effectively use the different social media tools to your advantage in a job search.  I would recommend this to anyone who is starting or in job search and also to anyone who wants to learn how to effectively use social media in general.",1335312000,,499,4.595505617977528

Another brilliant DVD from Joshua Waldman of Career Enlightenment. Great tips on what to do to exploit the power of your existing networks and to grow them further, research companies to find a best fit, identify & exploit affinities and more. Again, Jargon Free - OK, with the exception of the Reticular Activating System, but that's pretty important. A great resource for people at every stage of their career.

If, like I was, you're active on social networks but not using them in your job search then you're missing out. This DVD will help get you right back in the game!",1335312000,,773,5.954954954954955
8496089,5,B006BHMUUE,"Joshua Waldman understands the new rules of corporate networking better than anyone else I've ever seen.  I have heard him speak and was ""wowed"" with what I heard.  This video is the next best thing.",1334793600,,199,4.6571428571428575
8496090,5,B006BHMUUE,"""For dummies"" sounds a bit misleading in this context - the training assumes you're already using social media sites, and the focus is on how to use them better and why. Even though maintaining on-line persona adds another layer of complexity to job hunt, it seems to be a must in today's competitive economy.",1334707200,,309,4.7407407407407405
