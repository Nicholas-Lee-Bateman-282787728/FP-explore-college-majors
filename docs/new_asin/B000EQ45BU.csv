2526910,5,B000EQ45BU,"""The Facts Of Life"" was one of my favorite shows growing up because all of the characters were so likeable, and everyone could relate to them. There's rich and sometimes snobbish Blair (Lisa Whelchel) who had more blonde feathered hair than Big-bird. Jo (Nancy McKeon) joined the cast in the second season, and was a tough street-wise girl from NY that also had a very sensitive side. Then there's the funny girl-next-door Natalie (Mindy Cohn), didn't everyone know someone that looked just like Natalie? Tootie (Kim Fields) was the mouthy youngest cast member who always had a smart line (picture Dee from ""What's Happening"" but not at all mean-spirited). Rounding out the cast was Mrs. Garrett (Charlotte Rae) who was nursemaid, seamstress, cook, good friend, listener, and surrogate mother for these girls.

There are a total of 29 episodes from Season 1 and Season 2.

Here are all the episodes from Season 1 with descriptions and original air dates:

Molly is down in the dumps due to her parents' impending divorce.

Dope (First aired: 6/11/1980)

Here are all the episodes from Season 2 with descriptions and original air dates:

When Blair's cousin Geri (Geri Jewell) makes a big splash at Eastland Mrs. Garret thinks that Blair is embarrassed of her cousin (who has CP) beause Blair hides out in her room. But it's actually the green eye of jealousy that's bitten Blair. BTW, I love the song and dance routine that caps off the ep with Blair and Geri. Geri Jewell was such a great addition to the cast.

It's Mrs. Garrett's birthday and the girls (except Blair) steal a blouse to give her.

2526911,5,B000EQ45BU,"Some sitcom spin-offs are good in their own right (""Mork and Mindy"", ""Laverne and Shirley"") while others are deserving of a swift cancellation (""Joannie Loves Chachi"").

""The Facts of Life successfully spun off from ""Diff'rent Strokes"" and then unarguably went on to establish it's own far more successful and separate idenity. It did this by combining the 1970's 'women's buddy show' with a 1980's emphasis on wealth and luxury.

Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae), the Drumond's housekeeper, becomes housemother at Kimberly's boarding school in Peekskill New York. The Drummonds make 'special guest appearances' at Eastland into the second season. However, considering it is Kimberly's school, her single guest appearance in ""Rough Housing"" is puzzling. Surely, we would have seen her more?

29 episodes make up the combined season. Whomever was in charge of DVD production for this release remembered that the series did not become the cultural phenomena it is remembered as today until the second season. However important to establishing the series (and featuring a VERY young Molly Ringwald) the first season comparatively lacked the oomph which ultimately made the series click.  I'm also pleased that the price is bellow $30 dollars, studios actually want people buying this product as soon as it hits the shelves.

During the second season, the 'core' group of girls is paired down to four and their distinctive personalities are emphasized. Livening things up, 'rough' 'Jo' (Joanne)Polniaczek is added to the cast. Former season one regulars Molly Ringwald (Molly)Julie Anne Haddock (Cindy), Julie Piekarski (Sue Ann), and Felice Schachter (Nancy) come back for guest appearances.

Season 2 explains how this seemingly disparate group of girls ends up living together. After they are caught sneaking out to the Chugalug bar (The new girl part 2) the girls end up working in the kitchen--with Mrs. Garett always around to dispense advice---in order to be reinstated at Eastland. Realizing they do like working together, the girls follow Mrs. Garrett over when she opens up ""Edna's Edibles"" ('Gossip').

Other special episodes include ""The Return of Mr. Garrett"" because Mrs. Garett's ex-husband returns, along with his gambling problem. He is better known to my generation as the father of actor Alan Alda, but Robert Alda is an accomplished actor in his own right.

Another good episode is ""The Secret"" because Jo is torn between wanting to show off an accomplishment and being worried what her 'fancy' new friends will ultimately think of her father. This dilemma also reveals that Jo ultimately does care what her peers think of her.

Blair also deals with the opinions of others and her own internalized discomfort with 'difference'. Her cousin Geri (played by Geri Jewell) has cerebral palsy. Jewell made television history, becoming the first person with an obvious disability to become a recurring series regular. I was too young to appreciate everything this character did when first seeing the show, but her lines provide insight of what young adult women with disabilities go through.

There are two features, but the important thing is that this series is finally on DVD--and two seasons at once! This series should be required viewing for anybody even considering making a television spin-off.",1141430400,54,3308,5.2838095238095235
2526912,5,B000EQ45BU,"The Facts of Life was a great series involving the lives of mentor Mrs. Garrett and students Natalie, Blair, Jo, and Tootie at the Eastland School for girls. (Let's not forget about Julie Anne Haddock, Molly Ringwald, Julie Piekarski, and Felice Schacter -- season one girls.) The show started out in Eastland dorm and later moved to (season 2) the cafeteria where Mrs. Garrett was to keep and eye on the girls for distroying the kitchen catering van. When Season 5 arrived Mrs. Garret recieved a job offer from her son to open her own gourmet food shop, which she nervously accepted, forcing Mrs. Garrett to quit Eastland and all the girls moving in to help her out. 2 years later, the shop was destroyed by an fire and Mrs. Garrett announced she is tired of her store ""Edna's Edibles."" The girls convince Mrs. Garrett to become partners in a new business Over Our Heads (a trendy boutique -- and might I add very 80's and cool looking). In 1986 Mrs. Garrett falls in love with an old flame, gets married and moves to Africa, to run the house and the shop her sister Beverly Ann comes to Peekskill (Emmy and 8 Academy Award(s) Winning Actress -- Cloris Leachman). The series ended in 1988 with a marvelous 9 year run and is now a cult classic to many people around the world.

To us it was a show we could relate to and laugh.  The lessons you saw when you watched it as an adult.  Then is when we see all the important episodes in that show, not while watching it as teenagers.  Too bad.  It was sure a little more innocent back then, just a little.  It's a big lesson on how much our world has changed.  We see it in the kind of shows that people watch and give high ratings too like reality shows where people will humiliate themselves and their families for money and fifteen minute of fame.

2526951,4,B000EQ45BU,"""The Facts of Life"" was a spinoff series from the super successful series, ""Diff'rent Strokes."" The Drummonds beloved housekeeper Edna Garrett (played by the wonderful and ageless Charlotte Rae) gets a job as a house mother at an all girl boarding school, Eastland, in Peeksill, New York.

The first season includes several young female actresses including a young Molly Ringwald. The first season had a large cast but they managed to keep it together.

The 1980 actors strike may have been the reason for a shortened second season. There are only 29 episodes on three discs. One disc has the entire first season. The second season is split between two DVDS.

When they return for the second season, only three girls become regulars. There is the snobbish Blair Warner (Lisa Welchel); the nosy Tootie (Kim Fields); and the lovable Natalie Greene (Mindy Cohn). Mrs. Garrett is now the school's dietician and spends time in the school cafeteria. The threesome is joined by tomboyish tough talking street smart Jo Polnicek (Nancy McKeon). The foursome become roommates and friends.

If you want a family friendly sitcom for children today, this series touched on serious topics as well but gently rather than overt. The girls of my generation all related to one of the characters and grew up with them. Edna Garrett was the mother figure, teacher, and friend to the girls. Charlotte Rae played her beautifully.

Each episode also had a lesson in it perhaps not as obvious to viewers. Whether it was about gossiping, teen marriage, date rape, fake IDs, drinking, drugs, and more. Helen Hunt appeared in the first season.

I really enjoyed watching the series again. It reminded me of Saturday nights on NBC in the eighties. The cast appeared to get along and none of the girls ended up in trouble as adults. Lisa Welchel would become a memorable contestant on ""Survivor."" Nancy McKeon would become a regular fixture on television in movies and series. Kim Fields and Mindy Cohn are still active in the business. Mindy is also the voice of Velma in the newer ""Scooby Doo"" series.

The series is all about fun, friendship, and the facts of life done beautifully in the eighties. This series was perhaps one of the most influential sitcoms for young female viewers of its time period.",1432684800,,2277,4.883419689119171

2527005,5,B000EQ45BU,"I grew up watching this show. Re-watching these episodes bring back a lot of memories for me. We all had our favorites. My older sister loved Jo, my younger sister loved Natalie, I - being the only male in the household, favored Blair. Although I didn't follow the show from the beginning (I was far too young during the shows first couple of seasons), I did catch most of these episodes on re-runs in the late 80's. Today, watching these episodes as an adult brings a whole new perspective. Many deals with very serious topics- sexuality, divorce, bullying, shoplifting, suicide, and are discussed in a light-hearted manner while throwing in some laughs as well. The first season is an almost different show. Before the show was re-tweaked for Season 2, the cast had far too many characters, but at the centre of it all was the always gracious and motherly, Mrs. Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae).  Season 2 brought on a more focused show with the cast reduced to Blair Warner (Lisa Welchel), the pretty, rich blonde; Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn), the comedic, aspiring writer; her best friend, Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsey (Kim Fields), who despite her childish charm, created some mild chaos in several episodes due to her constant gossiping; and the no-nonsense, in-your-face Joanne ""Jo""  Polniaczek (Nancy McKean), who despite her rough exterior ended up getting along with most of the girls with the exception of the resident rich girl Blair.

Although most of these episodes are worthy of a view and contain more than a few laughs, my personal favorites from Season 1 are:

Rough Housing - In this episode, we are shown the nasty side of Blair Warner. Sensing competition from the other pretty blonde of the group, Cindy (Julie Anne Haddock) for the upcoming Harvest Queen pageant, she maliciously insinuates Cindy likes girls.

Like Mother, Like Daughter - Again with Blair at the fore-front, this time she is shamed when her very young and attractive mother comes for a visit to Eastland and is caught smooching with a married man.

I.Q - When nosy Tootie finds a list of all of the girls I.Q scores and blurts them out, it creates resentment. Especially when Sue Ann (Julie Piekarski) who is considered the smartest amongst her peers, is exposed as having the lowest I.Q of them all. The final test scene between Mrs. Garrett and Mr. Bradley (John Lawlor) is a hoot.

Emily Dickenson - Blair uses a poem written by Emily Dickenson and hands it in as her own creation. Her ""poem"" is highly praised but ultimately exposes her as a fraud.

Dieting - When Sue Anne get teased about her weight from Blair, she begins starving herself.

During season 1, the character of Natalie is very under-utilized. It will not be until Season 2 and beyond, when Natalie is finally given her moments to shine and unmasks Mindy Cohn as a delightful comedienne. The character of Jo (Nancy McKean) is brought in for season 2 and introduced to those watching, a charming tomboy, with some really rough edges who was proud, determined, but hiding a soft-spot. Although her and Blair would find it increasingly difficult to get along right up to the show's final season. My personal highlights of Season 2 are:

The New Girl (Parts 1 and 2) - Introduces us to Jo Polniaczek- The no nonsense teen from the Bronx. Her clashing with the snobby Blair is almost immediate.

Shoplifting - In order not to be outdone by the wealthy Blair, Jo and the other girls decide to steal a blouse from a trendy boutique for Mrs. Garrett for her birthday.

Gossip - When Tootie feels left out by her older room-mates, she decides to get revenge by spreading some gossip involving Blair and Nancy's boyfriend. However when her gossip involves Mrs. Garrett, it threatens not only  Mrs. Garrett's reputation, but her future in Eastland.

Sex-Symbol - When Natalie's study date spreads a rumor that he and Natalie went all the way, the girls (including Natalie .. at first) are appalled. But when Natalie misinterprets the girls laughter and comments as mocking, she decides to fuel the gossip in order to shut them up and prove that she is too can be a sex-symbol.

For those wanting a little bit of nostalgia with a little added charm and humor, I wholeheartedly recommend this set (and the other seasons that have been released on DVD). Although some of the humor is forced, and at time, Mindy Cohn appears to be laughing at her own jokes - LOL, when the show works, it works. Also, practically everyone can identify with a lot of these characters and the topics being discussed. Times and fashions have definitely changed since these girls were in Prime-Time but the issues they bring to the forefront and the humor live on.

Now release the rest of the seasons on DVD please.",1399852800,2,4731,4.758241758241758
2527006,5,B000EQ45BU,"Facts of Life was a part of my youth, so I continue to harbor a very soft spot for Blair, Tootie, Joe and Natalie...and of course, Mrs. Garrett. Sony has taken pains to remaster this set for optimal quality. Is it perfect? No. It can never be. One of many series shot on tape, rather than film, Facts of Life experiences all of the shortcomings from that inferior format one might expect. However, Sony has made every attempt to minimize these shortcomings. Video noise - while present - is kept to a bare minimum. Color bleeding is also present but negligible. The image is mostly bright and sharp except in long shots that look slightly soft and washed out - as expected. Overall, thumbs up.

2527023,5,B000EQ45BU,"If your teen years were in the 1980s, chances are you watched this TV show and tuned in to see the girls of Eastland learn ""the facts of life"".  Who could forget Blair, Jo, Natalie, and Tootie?  I often wonder if the actresses still keep in contact with one another today as they will forever be united in television history.  But the one most pivotal character the show could never be the same without was Mrs. Garrett.  She was cool, caring, wise, thoughtful, and the best advice-giver on Earth.  God bless the wonderful actress, Charlotte Rae.  We love you, Charlotte!  I highly recommend this series, especially to anyone with a teenage daughter.  Compared to the cultural rot on television these days, this series will bring you back to the days when television was a wholesome joy to watch.  I cannot review every single episode, but I have listed the top 12 in my opinion:

1.  The New Girl (season 2) - The show was re-tooled from 7 Eastland girls to 4 Eastland girls.  This turned out to be a wise move for the show's success.  A new girl, Jo, was added to the cast along with Blair, Natalie, and Tootie from season one.  In this episode, the girls hot-wire the school van to go to a local bar and end up damaging the van and having to be bailed out of jail.  In an effort to keep the girls from expulsion and to pay off the damage to the van, Mrs. Garrett has the girls agree to work in the school cafeteria and live above the kitchen.

2.  Double Standard (season 2) - Blair's boyfriend asks Jo to the country club dance instead of Blair...only because he thought making moves on Jo would be easier because she was from the ""wrong side of the tracks"".

3.  Teenage Marriage (season 2) - Jo and Eddie (her Navy boyfriend from the Bronx) impulsively decide to get married and Mrs. Garrett and company try to stop it.

4.  The Affair (season 3) - Natalie sees her father in a restaurant with a woman who is not her mother and confronts him about it.

5.  New York, New York (season 3) - Blair and Jo go back home to New York to visit with their friends.  Although Blair's friend Dina is much how she used to be and Jo's friend Jessie is much how she used to be, both realize how much they have grown and matured from their friends.

6.  Runaway (season 3) - Tootie feels left out when the other three girls take a trip to New York to see Sophisticated Ladies so she takes a train to the city without her parent's permission or, initially, Mrs. Garrett's knowledge.  Not seeing the three other girls at the theatre, Tootie hangs out in a diner and is befriended by a prostitute who attempts to recruit her.

7.  Give and Take (season 3) - When Mrs. Garrett loses the funds from a pension and asks for a raise in order to have enough money for her retirement, the Headmaster turns her down.  To supplement her income, she takes a second job and the girls quickly notice she does not have the same amount of time for them.  When she tells them why, the girls attempt to help her out.

8.  Front Page (season 3) - Jo prints a story about her journalism teacher indicating he was ""busted"" at a cocaine party.  Jo does not get all the facts right and tries to fix her mistakes, but the teacher is fired anyway.

9.  The Four Musketeers (season 3) - Also known as the ""paint fight episode"".  The girls are at odds with living with one another, but come to learn that the debt has been paid off and they no longer have to live over the kitchen and work in the cafeteria.  They move out, but soon realize how much they miss one another.  Mrs. Garrett tells them their room must be painted and the floor stripped/waxed for new occupants.  After a ""paint fight"", the girls have to pay for the damage done and agree to living over the kitchen again and working in the cafeteria.

10.  For the Asking (season 4) - Natalie is afraid to ask a boy that she likes to the Sadie Hawkin's Day Dance because she thinks he does not like her.  However, it turns out he was waiting for her to ask him.

11.  Aint Misbeholden (season 4) - Jo's scholarship funds are eliminated due to budget cuts, but she refuses to accept a scholarship from the Warner Textile Foundation...Blair's family business.

12.  Take My Finals, Please! (season 4) - The girls pull an allnighter for final exams the next morning.  One of my all-time favorite episodes.  This is the one that Natalie wears her infamous lightning bolt hat.",1386028800,,4395,4.366666666666666

2527045,5,B000EQ45BU,"This DVD set incorporates the first two seasons of ""The Facts of Life"", which ran for 9 seasons.

While I enjoyed the first season, it's easy to see why the show got retooled.  The first season feels like a series of staged ""after school specials"" - oh, these are entertaining, with ""Dope"" being insanely funny (for the right reasons; I was laughing with it rather than at it), but something felt lacking.  It feels too trite.  Worst of all, an episode featuring a tomboy-like girl is worried that she is not ""normal"".  I think the writers were trying to pitch an anti-GLBT message, but the whole episode waffles all over the place and as cowardly as possible.  Or maybe the episode is trying to say girls playing sports is bad.  Either way, the wishy-washy format of this first year shows why it was deemed a ""mid-season replacement"", with only four stories airing in September (with the rest in March-June).

Now, the retooled season 2 features only Blair, Natalie, Tootie, and Mrs Garrett from the original ensemble, and a new character - Jo - is added.  Jo also happens to be a tomboy, but she doesn't think she is ""weird"" in any way.  Ably acted, the addition of Jo would help ensure success.

The format for season 2 is changed from a stagey, typical-sitcom presentation to one a more dramatic flair, blending drama with comedy and in a far more effective way.  In a word, it was ""innovative"".  And ""effective"".  :)  The season 2 premiere, ""The New Girl"", spares absolutely no time in setting up the new format - complete with conflict and interplay (and a rescored theme tune), and it's in season 2 where the show solidifies its format and, for being over 30 years old (!!!), holds up extremely well.  The same format would work without issue for several seasons, before being retooled again to contrive their remaining together - thanks to puberty and the fact that shows featuring children invariably see children growing up.

But season 2 also has an odd running schedule - starting late in November, but continuing to March.  Full-length seasons start in September and continue through to April or May.  But season 2 quickly proved to the execs that this new format was solid and engaging, with a variety of characters one can like and dislike all at the same time, which is what every TV show should strive to have.

For some odd reason, I'm impressed by the DVD menus and their layout - the layout of the episodes is fairly straightforward, but the use of color, the original font, and finding promo photographs of cast members shows a fair amount of effort was used in the menus' construction.  many shows' menus feel more generic.

Especially with season 2's massive format change, and the honing of some great morals and ethics into compelling 30 minute episode slots, this set is definitely worth a rental or purchase.",1362182400,3,2835,4.707910750507099

2527064,4,B000EQ45BU,"THE FACTS OF LIFE was a spinoff series of DIFFERENT STROKES that ran on NBC from Friday August 24, 1979 to Saturday May 7, 1988 regarding former housekeeper(Mrs. Edna Garrett)on DIFFERENT STROKES who is now the housemother at the fictional Eastland School all-females private school in Peekskill, New York.

The girls in Mrs. Garrett's care included spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), overweight impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), the youngest gossipy Tootie Ramsay(Kim Fields), and eventually the tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon)which came aboard in the Fall of 1980 when NBC kicked off the 2nd Season of THE FACTS OF LIFE.

The shows 1st Season focused on the troubles of 7 girls and typically revolved around around a centrally morality-based or ""lesson teaching"" theme and the pilot episode attracted controversy due to Lisa Whelchel's character insinuating that her schoolmate Cindy Webster was a lesbian, because of being a tomboy who frequently showed affection for other girls.

FACTS OF LIFE's 1979-80 Season also dealth with issues including drug abuse, sex, eating disorders, parental relationships, and peer pressure and the oddity of this sitcoms 1st Season was that even though some of the other girls were obviously older than others, all the girls who lived at the Eastland School dormitory took the same classes together.

THE FACTS OF LIFE's 1980-81 Season was retooled extensively since the producers felt their were way too many characters given the limitations and that the plotlines should be more focused to give the remaining girls more room for character development, so 4 of the characters from the 1st Season such as Cindy(Julie Anne Haddock), Sue Ann(Julie Piekarski), Nancy(Felice Schachter), and Molly Parker(Molly Ringwald)were all ousted from the show in the Spring of 1980 while this shows 2nd Season was underway.

Unfortunately, THE FACTS OF LIFE did not start out as a ratings winner on Friday nights in its late Summer debut in 1979 or in its second tryout in the Spring of 1980 and had only ranked #74 out of 79 shows on the air in the year-end Nielsen ratings and was NBC's lowest-rated series, so the show was retooled in hiatus and was moved to Wednesday nights where it finally started to flourish in its 1980-1981 Season  ranking at a respectably moderate #26 in the Nielsen ratings.

Therefore, at the time THE FACTS OF LIFE became NBC's 4th highest-rated scripted series following LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, FACTS OF LIFE's parent series(DIFFERENT STROKES), and CHiPs and THE FACTS OF LIFE had ranked in the mid and upper 20's in the Nielsen ratings for nearly every season until it hit its 7th Season in the Fall of 1985 and had moved to Saturdays, plus this shows time slot change dropped the ratings down to #31 in its 1986-87 Season and then down to #37 in its 1987-88 Season before it cancelled in the Summer of 1988 when the cast and crew of the show ran out of steam.

Overall, THE FACTS OF LIFE was one of my favorite classic sitcoms and it takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch this show at 8:30 PM every Wednesday night on NBC right after DIFFERENT STROKES at 8PM from the Autumn of 1980 thru the Summer of 1981 and when I used to watch this show after FAMILY TIES every Wednesday night from the Fall of 1983 thru the Winter of 1984 and then when I used to watch THE FACTS OF LIFE on Saturday nights before watching 227 and GOLDEN GIRLS.",1344988800,,3445,4.8568994889267465
2527065,5,B000EQ45BU,"Wonderful show. It has so many good things in it: clean humor, decent storyline, likable characters, memorable moments, and good values clearly shown in each episode (and I can't say the gorgeous women bother me, especially in the case of the first season ;) Julie Piekarski and Lisa Whelchel especially).
  What was really nice about the first season was the diversity of characters. Sue was very energetic, enthusiastic, and smart. Molly was just plain adorable, Blair was a rare combination: likable and cheerful, yet often conceded and snobby. Nance was interesting: a knockout for one, and while she was boy-crazy, she also had a certain reserved and quiet nature about her. Natalie was kind of goofy (some of the things she said were so blonde sometimes though it was hilarious), and Cindy (the tomboy) was very ambitious and so innocent you had to love it. Edna Garrett was excellent; a funny, intelligent, decent, wise woman who was very much like a mother to all her students. Finally, Mr. Bradley had an irreplaceably awkward sense of humor that was simply hilarious.
  So I was sad to see so many characters go in the 2nd season, but I found the 2nd season to have a different kind of charm. I like it almost as much as the first, in fact. The new character Jo is an interesting contrast, being the first rebellious one in the group. Also, you got to know each character more intimately this way, since there were fewer of them.
  I was surprised to hear this was a spin-off of Different Strokes. To be totally honest, I wasn't crazy for that show. I found it distasteful, slightly corny, and uninteresting (always felt that way about Coleman's humor). But The Facts of Life? I LOVE it!

They mention sex in every episode! It gets annoying. And the acting is bad. it kind of funny, but you can watch a much cleaner show and get ""funny"". For example, Full House. Full house is definitly cleaner than ""the facts of life"" and more interesting too. And it's a bit funny. It isn't the cleanest show around, but cleaner than the facts of life. Although the earlier seasons aren't clean, the later ones are cleaner.

2527075,5,B000EQ45BU,"The Facts of Life premiered when I was already about 21. So I was past the issues that confront adolescents during their school years. But this show was so good, it could be enjoyed by those of all ages. It was warm, funny, and showed teenage girls in a positive light. Each episode had a moral to it, without being too preachy.

The characters really were '80s'-types; meaning that they reflected the increasingly conservative mood of the country during the run of the show. In other words, they were more serious-minded, focused, and had a bit more faith in their teachers, than we who were teens in the 70s seemed to. When I was a teen in the early through mid 70s, kids seemed to be wilder (more inclined towards partying, drug-use, drinking, and casual sex). But then, I was a teen before the conservative Reagan-era of the 80s. Teens of the early-80s were entering a new era, where they were beginning to buckling-down, and take their futures seriously. And the characters in the The Facts of Life certainly did so. Of course, they had their basic insecurities, and conflicts, like all teens do.

The Jo Polniaczek character was an especially positive role model for girls, since she seemed to be the most strong-willed and intelligent of the bunch. Mrs. Garrett was also excellent as the stern, yet understanding housemother/confidant/guardian for the characters. I do agree with some of the others who commented on the show, regarding how it was best during the first couple of years or so. It was still okay to watch when Mrs. Garrett left the show, but Cloris Leachman just didn't seem to cut it as their new 'mother-figure'. I would definitely recommend this show, both for the 80s nostalgia-factor, and the excellent characters. Just be aware that the first few seasons of the show are the best.",1262044800,,1807,4.7699680511182105
2527076,5,B000EQ45BU,"Few people realize that Mrs. Garrett is an alien.  And a fine one she was.  The first two seasons of Facts of Life are a perfect manifestation of her alien characteristics, as when her ex-husband arrives and begins to court her.  This is good stuff.

2527079,4,B000EQ45BU,"I grew up watching ""The Facts of Life"" but I was too young to remember the earlier seasons. Though I didn't remember anything other than the characters and theme song while watching this set (season 2), I felt right at home with the show.

I had never seen season 1 before. It really is... awful - in a good-natured way. The cast was too big, the character development minimal, and the acting was iffy at best. The jokes were not well timed, though some made it through okay. If anything, season 1 is worth it for the die-hard fans to see the three 'main' characters (Tootie, Natalie, Blair) so young and fresh as actors (and to see Blair in a better light without Jo around to piss her off). It also really made me appreciate season 2 a lot more, which is a far sight better than season 1 in quality.

Other reviewers have already covered the story of the show. I just wanted to add that I think this set is a good value for the two seasons in one, and is well-made. 2 DVD thin-paks with 2 discs in each, two discs per season. Two small actor interviews of ""remembering the Facts of Life"" is included on the  first disc - the only people missing from which are Molly Ringwald, the gal who played Sue Ann, Nancy McKeon, and Charlotte Rae.

One other thing - ""Facts of Life"" was known for breaching subjects many other sitcoms, especially those aimed at teen girls, would never touch. By today's standards, many of these end up feeling like ""a very special episode"" but I admire the tact each episode had in handling each subject. Perhaps a might cheezy for todays audience, I though season 2 had aged a bit better than I had originally  feared. And now I cannot wait for season 3 to arrive!",1216771200,4,1690,4.369426751592357

2527093,4,B000EQ45BU,"A successful spin-off from ""Diff'rent Strokes"", THE FACTS OF LIFE ran for 10 years, spawned three telemovies and definitely won a cherished place in the hearts of those who grew up with it.  The series follows Mrs Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae) as she leaves her position as housekeeper for the Drummond family, and becomes housemother to the girls at Eastland Private School in Peekskill NY.

The first episode of THE FACTS OF LIFE (""Rough Housing""), featured guest appearances from the cast of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" (Gary Coleman, Dana Plato, Todd Bridges and Conrad Bain), a device used mainly to help lure audiences into the new show, and to re-establish the character of Mrs Garrett in a different environment.  Gary Coleman would often make fleeting guest appearances, and also turns up for the first story of Season Two (""The New Girl"").

THE FACTS OF LIFE follows the everyday lives of the girls at Eastland, a private boarding school in upstate New York.  Mrs Garrett acts as moral guide and support to her charges, a rag-tag group of teenage girls whose lives are anything but dull.  The spotlight later shifts to four specific girls who become the key characters from Season Two onward: self-absorbed ""teen queen"" Blair (Lisa Whelchel), jokester Natalie (Mindy Cohn), sassy Tootie (Kim Fields) and tough new girl Jo (Nancy McKeon).

This DVD set includes all the episodes from Seasons One and Two; plus a new reunion featurette with the original girls.  For the original fans of THE FACTS OF LIFE, this will be a fun trip back to your childhood.  Highly-recommended.

2527098,5,B000EQ45BU,"I loved The Facts of Life as a kid and I still like watching it to this day.  This package of first and second seasons on DVD, however, gives us a rare glimpse at what the show could have been had it not changed and where it went to.

Rarely shown in reruns today, the first season of The Facts of Life began with Mrs. Garrett leaving her post as the housekeeper of the Drummond home (on Diff'Rent Strokes) to become the house mother of a private girls' school dormatory.  Here we met the original cast of the show, which was much bigger than the four Blair, Tootty, Jo and Natalie that we would know and love with this show.  Thanks to a larger cast, we are given more of an opportunity to see conflict and multiple story lines.

This was so much of a time in history to see a show like this.  Not just the obvious things that we poke fun of like the hairstyles and clothes (he who is proud of the haircut or wardrobe they had twenty years ago may cast the first stone).  It was also before political correctness seized and choked the life out of us (Tooty as a black girl on roller skates, the occational jibe about Natalie's weight, mention of a girl being ""strange"" not a lesbian, use of drugs, etc.).  It was about young women growing up and seeing the world in a sweetly neive way, as we all did way back when.  Being put together under a circumstance (in their case, a school) and having to deal with differences and live together in a community.  The neverending tension between smart mouthed Jo and narcistic Blair was played out for years, while Natalie and Tooty would be BFFs.

And, I wonder what the show would have been like if they had stuck to the original cast and not made cutbacks.  The producers realized that the girls would not be wearing short shorts in the middle of winter in upstate New York after all.  Molly Ringwald might never have risen to the stardom level she did had she not been cut from this show.  Maybe it would have been an alltogether different experience.  Still, it remains a beloved old show that I treasure.",1183334400,2,2051,4.346456692913386
2527099,5,B000EQ45BU,"3 great things about this show, no, make it 4:

1. 2 seasons worth to start with, so more episodes to look forward to.  29 make up this combo.  Could be at least 44 given the current season average is 22, but TFOL didn't exactly get off to a smooth start.  It didn't air all the way thru the first season and changes had to be made for 2nd to happen.
2. Everything's closed captioned.  Except the bonus section, that is (would be nice if it is, though).
3. The show was done for 9 seasons in all, so some stuff I missed I'll finally get to see, provided the remaining seasons are released.
4. Easy to watch, not exactly earth-shattering gritty, but fluffy compared to other concurrent sitcoms.

My all-time favorite show, the Brady Bunch, only lasted 5 seasons and I've seen *everything* more times than I can possibly remember.  Fortunately, this sitcom ran nearly twice as long and there are a few episodes I've yet to see, some only partly (the one in season 9 where Blair is hospitalized after a car wreck is one of them), but I look forward to finally in their entirety once the rest of the series is released.  Here's hoping sales will continue to be good to justify this!  I understand the sales of seasons 1-2 combo were so good that 3 came out before too long.  I went ahead and ordered all 3 at once.  Watched all in a matter of days.  What a party.

The fact that all the episodes are closed-captioned sure helps.  TFOL probably wasn't CC yet when it debuted in 1979, but it was, perhaps by the 4th or 5th season.  I finally got to see the first and second season episodes with CC for the first time, probably ever.

Someone else here mentioned a couple of episodes that Nick-at-Nite wouldn't air due to the serious subject matter involved.  It's one from season 1 where Sue Ann collapses from trying to lose so much weight and the one from season 2 where one girl takes her own life after becoming student council president, right?  I don't remember them, but watching them now seemed new to me if I haven't seen them.  I enjoyed them even though it's understandable as to why they've been denied airtime.  I didn't know about them til I read the posts here, but I know TFOL isn't exactly the fluffiest show on earth if you know what I mean.  TFOL does a good job at covering sensitive issues on occassion without being too depressing.

I remember how much I enjoyed TFOL in the first season, but was somewhat disappointed when the cast was pared down to 5 people for season 2.  I didn't exactly like how they changed the show, but stuck with it anyway.  I forgot what my thoughts were at the time, but I imagine perhaps TFOL had been struggling in the ratings so they had to move mountains to survive.  Seems the changes worked; it got to run for 7 more years after that.  Not many shows get to last this long.

I enjoyed the first 3 seasons.  Hopefully the entire series will be released.  See separate review for season 3.",1182643200,2,2937,4.377079482439926

for some reason i couldn't bring myself to bestow the 5 star award.  is it the cheesy lines?  the laugh track?  the sanitized (yet pertinent) subject matter?  blair warner's post farrah hair job?

only time will tell if TFOL will stand up to become included as a classic of my generation, as I Love Lucy and Leave It To Beaver were classics of the generation before me.  but for now, it's comforting enough.  at least this set is the good years... before the girls hit college and for some reason hung around Edna's Edibles more than any self respecting college girl would have.

2527120,5,B000EQ45BU,"They just don't make shows like this for girls to grow up with !!!

Almost every episode in the series' short first season plays like a ""Very Special Episode."" Each episode guarantees viewers a little laughter, a few tears, and very important lessons.

Cindy is nominated to compete against Blair in the annual Harvest Queen pageant but becomes upset when Blair obliquely accuses her of being a lesbian (""Rough Housing""). Blair discovers her mother kissing a married man and worries that dear old mom is about to ruin yet another marriage (""Like Mother, Like Daughter""). When Tootie finds a list of everyone's I.Q. scores, Sue Ann discovers that she has Eastland's lowest I.Q. (""I.Q.""). Blair learns about sex in Mrs. Garrett's sex ed class, but it takes a hunky delivery boy to teach her about love (""The Facts of Love, AKA Sex Education""). A school project on family trees leads Natalie to reveal that she is adopted, but she has mixed feelings on taking up Blair's offer to find her ""real"" mother (""Adoption""). Molly's parents are heading to divorce court, and even a lamebrain plan cooked up by the other students can't stop them (""Molly's Holiday""). Blair and Sue Ann are allowed to join an exclusive clique of students, but to be truly accepted, they have to smoke marijuana (""Dope"").

One Very Important Lesson that the cast learned very quickly is that sometimes TV series are rethought, and sometimes actors get fired. When The Facts of Life returned for a second season in the fall of 1980, Sue Ann, Nancy, Cindy, Molly, and Mr. Bradley were no longer cast members (although the students do make brief appearances in subsequent episodes). Nancy McKeon joins the cast as Jo, a street-smart tough girl who rides a motorcycle and sometimes gets in trouble with the law. She is sent to Eastland in an attempt to tame her wild ways, but she isn't even there a week before she and the girls are thrown in jail and expelled from Eastland (""The New Girl""). They are allowed back in school, but only if Mrs. Garrett takes personal responsibility for their actions. Soon Blair, Jo, Tootie, and Natalie are rooming across the hall from Mrs. Garrett and working in the school kitchen (where Mrs. G is now the dietician). Jo also attempts to elope with her boyfriend (""Teenage Marriage"") and tries to hide the fact that her father was just released from prison (""The Secret"").

The series really is a triumph in good casting. Most viewers will be won over by the sparkling cast. The girls truly seemed to be friends - to each other they were growing up and experiencing life lessons together, and in a weird way, teaching the viewers.

EXTRA FEATURES

The bonus features can be found on disc one. In the ""Remembering The Facts of Life"" featurette (18:27), casting director Eve Brandstein and actors Kim Fields, Lisa Whelchel, Mindy Cohn, Felice Schachter, and Julie Anne Becker discuss how they came to be involved with the show that was once titled Garrett's Girls. Schachter and Becker touch on their disappointment at be written out of the series at the end of the first season when the producers and the network decided that there were simply too many characters. Plus it is revealed why Tootie wore those roller skates throughout the first season. Brandstein and the producers loved Fields' professionalism and her comic timing, but she was much younger and smaller than her cast mates. Their solution? Cast Fields anyway and put her in roller skates to make her taller.

""After Facts"" (3:50) catches up with what the actors listed above have been doing since leaving the series. I won't ruin the suspense, but I'll tell you that one's a teacher, one is a fundraiser, one is a stay-at-home mom with several kids, and two are still acting.",1158710400,2,3740,4.798136645962733
2527121,5,B000EQ45BU,"I always loved this show as a teenager.  In the 80s, it was the one sitcom we could count on that we could relate to for the issues of the day, although some of the topics had to be airbrushed.  Still, we felt that Blair, Jo, Natalie, and Tutti were going through so much of what we were because they were our ages, and we were always guided into making better deciscions than had our parents said the same identical things.  In a way, I have to laugh now, because NBC found a way to get through to my generation by recycling our parents' advice through our peers, and sometimes it worked.  Sometimes we cheered for the girls and did what we wanted to anyway!

I always thought it unfair that Julie Piekarski and Felice Schachter got the axe after year one, but had to applaud the addition of Nancy McKeon in season two.  She was exactly what the show needed, and her character played well off Lisa Whelchel's snobby Blair, because the two girls actually learned to respect each other begrudgingly almost from the first.  The show was reduced to crud in the last few years of its run, but I can find no fault in the first two seasons of the show which are my favorite.  If you're an 80s fan and love inoffensive shows with good values, get the Facts of Life--The Complete First and Second Seasons.  It was one of my birthday presents last week, and it takes me back to a more innocent time when I can now say that I'm proud to be my age.",1157932800,,1437,4.273062730627307
2527132,5,B000EQ45BU,"A wonderful journey back to a more innocent time, the late 70's and early 80's! This series truly captures the magic of that wonderful era and is certainly one of the all-time great TV sitcoms.

Most TV series suffer from ""first season"" growing pains and ""The Facts of Life"" certainly had its share. But shining through the first season ""fog"" is an amazing sense of fun radiating from the youthful cast. It's an absolute joy to watch the young actors as they find thier comedic footing. It's that pure sense of youthful magic that ultimately rescues the series.

""The Facts of Life"" had a positive message, projected a strong sense of ""right"" and ""wrong"", and never had to apologize for it. That innocence and optimism is sorely missed on TV today.

If you're a child of the 80's the nostalgia value is ""totally awesome"". There are also plenty of great lessons for ""new students"".

Highly recommended!

* All episodes are high quality transfers to DVD.

* Special features: Two featurettes consisting of interviews with cast and crew!

2527133,4,B000EQ45BU,"This collection of TV episodes is very well done and better packaged than other DVD sets.  The video quality seems excellent for this old material.  Compare it to the early ""Three's Company"" seasons and you will see an enormous difference.

The collection contains two bonus features; a remembering the ""Facts of Life"" feature and a where-are-they-now ""After"" Facts feature.  Like most old TV shows there's a star that sees the show that gave them their career as a burden.  With ""The Facts of Life"" that star is Nancy McKeon.  Like the reunion movie she's doesn't appear in the bonus features either.  (Kinda odd considering her character was designed to counter Blair's snobbish attitude, and now she's the snob in real life)  It's really a shame that she couldn't be bothered with this because her addition in the second season was a critical part of this show's success and her insight would have been interesting.

The content itself is miss and hit (Intentionally reveresed).  If you've ever seen the first season, don't expect it to be any better than it was.  To say that first season was a 20 pound turd would be a compliment!  Fortunately the first season is somewhat small so the pain won't be that bad.

The second season has aged remarkably well.  I saw an episode from one of the final seasons a few years back and noticed it didn't age well at all.  The 2nd season, however, is still entertaining.  I was surprised that this second season was also very small.  I assumed the first was a mid-season replacement but you'd think the second would have been a full 24 episode run.  Maybe the network wasn't willing to pay for that many episodes considering the first season was so awful.

I did not give this set 5 stars for one big reason...

Where was the pilot episode that aired as a Diff'rent Strokes episode?  It really belongs here, and it's omission is very noticible.  Hopefully if all the seasons are released this will find its way onto a set as a bonus feature.",1157068800,4,1983,4.654178674351585

2527135,5,B000EQ45BU,"""The Facts of Life"" is one of those great television shows that defined the 80s. It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.

This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, includes some actually good extras that includes interviews with some key cast members, and simply gives the fans of the show what they wanted. The transfer to DVD seems okay or decent. The extras, as mentioned, were good ... they included interviews of some of the women who played the girls in the first season (and made a few appearances in season 2).

I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few. The writing wasn't too cheesey and the plots were fresh and still are today. This is one of those shows, and DVD releases, that I'd have to say is a ""must own."" This was a piece of television history when T.V. wasn't loaded down with reality shows and poor shows. Get this show on DVD, you won't be disapointed.",1156377600,,1122,4.46829268292683

I also liked how they released the first two seasons together, that way you didn't have to wait until Season 2 to see Jo and the new setup.  Since this show ran 9 seasons, I wish they'd release more double season sets.  I also loved how the dvd includes the original airdate episodes, not the syndicated ones I recorded off of USA Network and Nick at Nite.  Its nice to see episodes in their entirety.  Great job Sony and I look forward to season 3 on October 24.",1155513600,2,528,4.188118811881188

2527138,3,B000EQ45BU,"I have to say that watching the 1st season was a little painful--I'm not sure what happened with the casting but a couple of the actresses really couldn't act at all.  It was kind of like watching the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders when they were on The Love Boat--cute but that's about it. The writing had a lot to be desired of, too, but got a little better as the season progressed.  Thank goodness the choices on who moved on to the 2nd and beyond seasons was correct with Blair, Tootie, Natalie and later, Jo. Definitely easier to watch!

As many ""Facts of Life"" fans might agree, Season One was horrific. The show was nearly cancelled because there were simply too many girls and too many sprawling storylines, which didn't grasp viewers as well as the second season, when the four girls everyone grew to love - Jo, Natalie, Tootie and Blair - became the focus. I fear that packaging the two seasons as a set was just a marketing ploy, since many people probably wouldn't buy the first season alone.",1152835200,8,641,4.487179487179487

2527156,5,B000EQ45BU,"I was very excited when I heard that the DVD of the first and second seasons was available, so I immediately bought it and began watching it as soon as I got home.  As previous reviewers have already covered summaries of the episodes, I'll just say this: the Facts of Life covered a lot of issues that aren't addressed in children's shows today.  In the first two seasons alone you deal with sex, teenage marriage, interracial marriage, child exploitation, eating disorders, suicide, and homosexuality (in a round-about way in the first episode) just to name a few of the many issues covered.  And while the show did improve when the cast was streamlined, it had already staked its reputation as a show willing to tackle the tough issues affecting teens and still manages to be relevant today with a minimal amount of dated jokes.

The extra features are only on the first disk, but you get to see interviews with cast members including some of whom were cut (more like severely reduced and eventually written out) from the cast.

The DVD set is worth it for anyone who enjoyed this show, especially since networks that do run the re-runs tend to cut out  some of the tougher situation episodes (including the ones on suicide, sex, and drug use) in order to sanitize the show.  And it was also a lighthearted precursor to Degrassi, another one of my favorites.

And I'm willing to proclaim that in the Blair/Joe rivalry I'm a Blair fan!  I loved all the characters, of course, but Blair had some of the funniest moments when having to deal with humility.

If you are a fan of the show, pick up the DVD and see this show digitally remastered and relive the days at Eastland School for Girls.",1149724800,4,1690,4.6033333333333335
2527157,5,B000EQ45BU,"In 1979, the NBC hit show Different Strokes spun off the TV show The Facts of Life for Charlotte Rae's character Mrs Garrett.

During the first season, she had seven young women at the Eastland School, who she was housemother to. By season two, The show  was streamlined to four students (and the core of the show for the rest of the show's life).This career move was the best for the show.

I enjoyed watching this show> it had messages shows like about self images, rumors and gossip, Teen weddings, Suicide and others subjext you think a comedy show wouldn't do. They did it and it workes well

The first season  had too  many girls to enjoy and get to know. The show was great in its first season, however I usually got confuse between Julie Piekarski amd Julie Anne  Haddock characters. Also it seemed Felice Schacter and Lisa Whenchel character were so similar, you can put the lines in either mouth and it woulkd work. And then there was young Molly Ringwall a few years before her 16 Candles days.

 It was the second year when the core group of GIRLS...Blair (Lisa Whelchel), Tootie (Kim Fields), Natalie (Mindy Cohn) and Jo (Nancy McKeon).... murphed into making this show into something special.

My take on this 29 episode DVD set is just like the Theme song, You take the good , You take the bad...Its the Facts of Life. It is fun and barely date itself and that what make it worthwhile--I wonder why TV land doesn't run this show  on their schedule. And kids can watch this and enjoy this with their parents

So when is season two coming?

2527158,5,B000EQ45BU,"I just finished watching the entire four-disc set.  This show was definitely part of my childhood (I fondly remember watching it with my favorite babysitter) and it was so exciting to finally be able to see it again.  Watching it again as an adult was tremendously fun, although now it seems that some of the acting is pretty bad (especially little Molly Ringwald, although she sure was cute), and much of the dialog is incredibly cheesy. I think one reason this show was so popular, in spite of the cheese factor, was that it was a show about young women and their mentor (Mrs. Garrett, obviously), who gave them solid advice, accountability, and unconditional love as they grew up. I think most people don't ever get to experience a relationship like that, but could vicariously, in a way, through the show.

The ""extras"" on the disc include brief interviews with Lisa Whelchel, Kim Fields, Mindy Cohn, and a few other actresses from the first season.  They talk about their experiences on the show and what they're doing now.

Now I'm dying to see Season 2!!  If more seasons are released, I hope Nancy McKeon will give an interview. Jo was my favorite character.",1149033600,6,1166,4.719211822660099
2527159,5,B000EQ45BU,"It's been so fantastic to see The Facts of Life from the very begining! Although I liked the first season, the second season was a huge improvement!!! You really got a chance to focus on four great characters, rather than seven that just didn't have enough airtime to fully develop.

Blair Warner: I'd have to say she was my all-time favorite and Lisa Whelchel played her to the hilt!!! Eventhough Blair could be pretty vain and obnoxious, she did it with such great comedic timing!!!

Natalie Green: Mindy Cohn was simply adorable. Her lines were so funny that it was very easy to notice she could hardly keep a straight face while saying them! She had the perfect combination of a great sense of humor and that cute little voice that always guaranteed to make you laugh out loud!!!

Joe Polnichick: I know I'm probably spelling her name wrong ( I'll edit it later)She was just the right character to give Miss Blair a run for her money! I really liked her tough girl attitude because it made her so unique from the other girls from the first season.

Tootie Ramsey: I must say Kim Fields was pretty annoying during the first and second season, but she did manage a few good storylines that really tested her acting skills. I definately was thrilled when she stopped wearing those hideous pigtails and rollerskates, I know she wore them to make her look taller, but it still was annoying.

All in all this show has held up well, the dvd quality and packaging are excellent! It was also great to see an on-camera interview with most of the cast! I hope Sony doesn't take too long releasing season 3!!!",1148428800,5,1601,4.564459930313589

I remember watching FOL when it first debuted,and was enamored by a number of the gals on the show,and was absolutely dismayed when the mass exodus of cast members for season 2 happened. I couldn't imagine why so many actresses would leave the show at once. However,at the time I had little knowledge of TV Ratings,and the massive shake up behind the scenes. I tuned in for a while to see if any of them would return,but other than a Molly episode in season 2,and the season 7 reunion,I was disapointed and rarely watched. With the release of season 1 and 2 on DVD,I got what I always wanted....season 1 in its entirety. It brings back a lot of memories of my youth,and times gone by,never to return.

This show is about a group of girls who live with a housemother (I think that what it's called) while going to an all girl school.  The first season consists of, I believe, were six girls.  The first season was good, but ofcourse, the seasons that follwed were a lot better.  In the second season, the group of girls are down to 4: Natalie (cute and loveable), Tootie (smart mouth, youngest of the group, Blair(conceated) and Jo (tomboyish)who live with Mrs Garrett.

This set contains the first two seasons of the show along with a couple of featurettes where we hear some of the actors reminisce and we find out what they are up to nowadays.

I was quickly sent back to my childhood when I popped these DVDs into my player and relived the first two seasons of this fantastic show.  One very nice thing about this set is that they chose to include the first two seasons rather than just the first season.  I, like many people, did not become a big fan of the show until the second season when they scaled back the cast and added the character of Jo.  Although I certainly enjoyed watching season one, it doesn't seem like the great show to me that it was for the rest of it's long run.

I've watched all of the episodes and now I remember how powerful this show could be at times.  There were several episodes that had me on the verge of tears.  Even though the second season is stronger, and seemlessly removes Mrs. Garrett from having to report to Mr. Bradley and that dreary one room set, the first season has some dramatically intense moments - the rivalry between Cindy and Sue Ann, an episode about eating disorders.  A episode about suicide in the second season pulls no punches.  Mostly, I really enjoy the acting.  Nancy McKeon's performance as Jo is very affecting, and Charlotte Rae as Edna Garrett is always moving.  I loved watching these episodes again.",1148083200,9,829,4.598639455782313

It's a spin off of Different Strokes and revolved around Mrs Garrett and revolved around the four different girls.  Blair -spoiled and rich, Natalie - a smart Alec, Jo - the rebelious one of the bunch and Tootie - the gossiper.  They were in a school called Eastland and they all pretty much grew up in front of our eyes.
This show was so funny and fun, and I can't wait to re-watch these episodes that I once knew like the back of my hand.  I don't know if this will be a hit for kids who are school age now like we were when this was on, but those in their 30 somethings, will totally enjoy this thoroughly.  It was a show that touched on a few relevant subjects for it's time (cancer and suicide), but it was never a deep deep show.  It touched on subjects that affected the girls characters and that is almost timeless.  Even now kids go through some of the same things these guys did.

however, before any of those female foursomes rocked television, we had Blair, Natalie, Jo and Tootie, practically inventing the genre, albeit slightly more innocent than the followers.

I grew up watching The Facts Of Life, I have so many timeless memories with this show.  While it's not my favorite 80's sitcom (it's second to Golden Girls to me), it has been my most sought-after and has been the holy grail of TV-DVD's for me.

Sony was smart to release seasons 1 and 2 together.  While I don't hate season 1, it's not amongst my faves and I don't think it would do well enough on it's own and we'd then be jipped of future DVD's.  This way, we get Molly Ringwald and Nancy McKeon in the same box set.  Season 2 is when Facts Of Life became the modern day classic we know it as today.

I hope to God we get all nine seasons of this show.  This is truly one of the classic sitcoms and future generations have the right to see it, as well as those of us who grew up on the show.

Started as a spin-off to Diffrent Strokes, Mrs. Garrett goes to Eastland (where Kimberly is a student) to become the house mother.  The early season featured a larger cast (Jo was the rebel biker who arrived in season 2 to complet the 5-some of Mrs. G, Blair, Tootie, and Natalie) and has always tackled issues from drug abuse to parental death.

It's light humor and typical plot of the 70's and 80's theme kept it popular for many years.  This show is utterly amazing, family oriented, and long overdue on DVD.  You will no doubt fall in love with its simplicity and fun times of 4 girls forced to live together as roomies (more so in season 2 forward).
