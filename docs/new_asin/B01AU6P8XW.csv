7610409,5,B01AU6P8XW,"Donnie Yen one last time perfectly portrays the humble and renowned master of Wing Chun, Ip Man. With crime rising in Hong Kong during the late 50s, corruption and theft plague the city. With the authorities outnumbered it is up to Ip Man to defend the community. He faces a new challenger who claims to be the true master of Wing Chun. Ip Man also goes through one of the toughest moments info his life.

Review: Very action packed. Very heartbreaking. However a few characters seem to be left out and/or not written in completely.",1509753600,,532,4.6

7610418,5,B01AU6P8XW,"Generally, I think sequel movies do not stand up to the quality of that original they follow. However, if I can think of the sequel as unified and indivisible from the original, then they are pieces of the unit. This is how I think of Gremlins and Gremlins 2, as contrasted with Young Guns and Young Guns 2. I loved Young Guns but it seems clear that a sequel was not in mind when the movie was created. I also do not believe any sequel was thought of when Gremlins was being produced, since if no Part 2 had been made, Gremlins stands alone fine. Yet, the two pieces work well together. With Ip Man, Parts 1, 2 and 3 in my estimation are pieces of a single unit. One may even go so far as to say sequels were planned ahead. While I say this, I also confess none of these assumptions are balanced against any sort of response by creators, so I must defer to their dissension if that happens. In that case, I would have to ask why pieces did not work better together.
Again, since I cannot independently speak to the historical accuracy, deference to those who put the piece together must be allowed; but my guess is, less planning would be needed on an historical piece if they simply stick to what actually happened. You would be correct to say that is the point of view of a person who has never done an historical piece .. of any kind. I resist comparing movies as if this were the best thing ever .. or the worst thing ever. Let it stand on its own merits. To me, Ip Man Part 3 needs Parts 1 and 2 but I would call them a good and solid unit.",1503619200,,1546,4.1395348837209305

7610432,2,B01AU6P8XW,"If you're going to keep making Ip Man movies, don't make them like this. It felt like the movie had three different scripts and instead of choosing one and refining it, they just sort of patched together the three scripts. One of the stories is about Ip Man's wife dying of cancer. I cared for her as a character, and I cared for Ip Man, but I didn't care to see a movie about this. This takes a good chunk of the movie and the only effect is has on the kung-fu part of the movie is on the kung fu part of the movie that sucked.

That part is the story of some dude who wants to be the guy and prove that his Wing Chun is the best so he works his way to the top of the Wing Chun world and challenges Ip Man to a fight. SPOILER ALERT. Ip Man doesn't show up because he's dancing with his dying wife. The central problem with this is that I don't care who is at the top of the Wing Chun world. By this time, Ip Man is the most respected martial artist in the world (as far as I can tell) and there are pretty much no stakes to forfeiting the fight. In fact, an old grandmaster is likely to retire while saving the most face by forfeiting such a fight anyhow.

The third plot is the best: It involves a bunch of thugs trying to shut down an elementary school. Corny, yes, but also awesome. This is where most good men can get excited about Kung fu: when it's in the service of beating the ever-living crap out of thugs who beat old men, kidnap and threaten to knife children, terrorize innocents, and burn schools to the ground. There are so especially great scenes in this plotline where Ip Man fights off thugs while literally defending his wife and child (in separate scenes). This is what it's all about for most of us, but unfortunately, this is only a fraction of the movie.

Then there's this weird tacked-on storyline about some brash young martial artist (Bruce Lee) who wants to be trained by Ip Man. It was really just a pointless cameo, which might have made a fun sort of epilog, but it was misleading to place it at the beginning of the movie because it had nothing to do with the movie.",1494633600,,2098,4.14987714987715

7610437,1,B01AU6P8XW,"There's always a problem with sequels, although I loved Ip Man 2. There wasn't a good plot to this, and the black dude that's being led up as the antagonist, really isn't. This one was a terrible action porno. The first one was a true story to be sure, and it inspires so much hope and almost a new patriotism for the Chinese people within me! It shows how terrible the effects of being a bystander nation in war can be, and how the people, and Ip Man, suffer so much loss of their happy lives and well being because of disgusting imperialism and how it can destroy hope. But he rises when all his fellow neighbors are too broken to try to regain their honor and respect as a people and shines as a beacon of light and as an example to Japan, that the Chinese cannot be dominated. Ip Man 2 was yet still another great movie, not as emotional and heart-wrenching as the first, but he still struggles to keep his family and himself supported while teaching some youth in Hong Kong the ways of Wing Chun and fights for honor while holding himself back to avoid risking his family's well being.",1490745600,,1090,4.321951219512195

7610455,2,B01AU6P8XW,"This was not as good as Ip Man 1, which is difficult to match. Ip Man 1 is like the original Star Wars in relation to the sequels. I didn't like this as much as Ip Man 2 either. The fight choreography was directed by the guy who did the Matrix fight scenes. That was part of the reason I didn't like it as much. The fighting was slick. It's just I find Sammo Hung's choreography more exciting. I wish there was more battling between Donnie and Tyson to show how wing chun can defend against boxing. If you check YouTube you will see plenty of people saying boxing beats wing chun. I think others brought this up, but Ip Man's son is still young in this film. I would think he would have to be older. Also, what happened to the child born at the end of IM2? There is a death of a major character. And as usual there is a poignant shot of Ip Man sitting in his chair contemplating life in the last shot. It's not great but worth watching if you liked 1 & 2.",1483747200,2,955,4.031578947368421

7610471,3,B01AU6P8XW,Ip Man 1 is one of my favorite kung fu films.  While it is not historically accurate the film is a lot of fun. Ip Man 2 is even less historically accurate but Donnie Yen fighting Sammo Hung on a wobbly table?  Fantastic.  They waited a couple years to make Ip Man 3 and the results are...disappointing.  It's not Donnie Yen - he's still fantastic in the role.  But the screenplay is simply a huge stretch.  And how old is Ip Man supposed to be at this point?  Pretty old.  Yet he's out there fighting 647 bad guys at once.  And then there's Mike Tyson.  Of course he's just playing a role written for a film.  But he's not believable.  One bit.  Not a shred.  And his facial tattoo is so OUT OF PLACE for the time period.  You would have thought they would have used movie magic to cover it up but the filmmakers don't.  Puzzling.  That said the fight between Tyson and Yen may be the highlight of the film.  Not the best film of the trilogy but perhaps worth the watch once or twice.,1480809600,2,984,4.171122994652406

It gives some history of Ip Mans love for his wife and what their love does for him and her. I hated her in 1 as an entitled princess and in 2 not so much but coming around. In 3, the screenwriting and acting was perfect, showing the way Ip man felt about her.
Long live the storyline and the Ip Man saga!!! 4 thumbs up!!",1476576000,,431,4.142857142857143

In terms of a martial arts movie the story is engaging and the fight choreography is pretty good (again not on par with 1 and 2, but good).  I will say the Mike Tyson vs. Donnie Yen fight was largely disappointing.  Two of the toughest guys on the planet and the fight looks terrible.  It was a big waste of what could have been.

If you can distance yourself from IP Man 1 and 2 and see this as it's own film it is enjoyable.  I would definitely recommend this to any IP Man / Martial Arts Enthusiasts.",1476230400,,588,4.0964912280701755

7610537,5,B01AU6P8XW,"Awesome fight choreography from Yuen Woo Ping. He always manages to come with something different. Donnie Yen is on top form as both an action hero and an actor. The 2 major fight scenes with the family business in the middle might seem slow to some people and the sometimes slapstick nature of the fight scenes with the ridiculous villain/punk are very amusing but not always to every Westerner's taste, but I though they were quite well done. Mike Tyson didn't get to do too much much but Donnie was in top form for a man in his 50s. He just keeps getting better.  Oh, the Thai boxer scene, great homage to Tony Jaa's first film, though in this case they are fighting in the opposite direction. The part in the elevator was amazing too.  Incredibly good fun and well worth a look or two-I replayed all the fight scenes a couple of times, they were so good. Enjoy!",1471564800,,865,4.433962264150943

7610579,4,B01AU6P8XW,"Not as good or memorable as the first two, but still great.  Donnie Yen nails it as master Ip!  I don't know what it is but he just such a likable character in these films.  While the action is very well filmed, what really makes this movie good is the story.  It has a lot of heart to it and teaches some great lessons about holding on to your morals even when you are living in such a corrupt world(which is something I think more movies should teach).  It focuses less on action and more on characters, which is done very well here.  Don't get me wrong though, The action scenes are still done very good here and are great to watch.  It also had this great fight between Ip man and an underground crime boss played by Mike Tyson!!!  That alone makes the movie worth watching for some people.  Overall, if you like a good martial arts movie with a lot a heart and soul to it and with a good story that focuses on characters as opposed to just action, then this movie is definitely worth checking out.  Also you don't really have to have seen the previous two movies to know what is happening in this one, but it does help.",1469404800,,1124,4.210280373831775

I didn't understand the Mike Tyson appearance (good fight scene there, though).  It seems they added that just to have another celebrity in there.  Just a shoddy movie all around.  It was kind of like watching Ong Bak (awesome, low-budget movie), then Ong Bak 2 and 3 (my muay thai brother's got a little money from sponsors, but went a little too far with the story line).  Just shoddy...

Yeah-yeah, this is entertainment but comeon, a little more believable doesn't hurt. Ip Man 4, if there is one, surely would bring out of the Bruce Lee character for a smooth transition? I wonder if that's the actual speed on the fighting scenes or they artificially speed it up, comparing to 20 years ago, man were they in slo-mo back then? LOL.",1468713600,,755,4.323943661971831

Mike Tyson fight is awesome. All of the action is, but that scene was much more than I expected of Mr. Tyson and stands out in my mind. I read he actually broke his thumb filming it. Anyway, the action is extremely intense and I applaud the effort of the entire crew.

This choreography in this installment is exquisite, the story is better paced than the second movie, and the cinematography is still top notch.  Donnie Yen fluidly moves back into the role that made him an international star, and it serves as a great bookend to the story of IP Man.

So why did I only give it 4 stars instead of 5?  Mike Tyson.  He was just too distracting and it kept pulling me out of the story.  His acting is awful, and his voice/looks are so distinctive that you can't pretend he's anyone other than himself.  I'm sure international audiences won't notice this as much, but for me it was a hang up.  I still almost gave it 5 stars as I loved everything else about the film.",1467158400,,803,4.342281879194631

There are multiple unresolved plot lines that make me feel like this is not the proper directors cut.  The pacing is slow and ploding.  The biggest disappointment is the change in the choreography of the fight scenes.  There is obvious wire work that is distracting.  While this will work in fantasy type martial arts films I don't believe that wire work was necessary for this installment of the franchise, at least wire work that is so obvious.

The movie is beautifully filmed and Donnie Yen does a good job again portraying  the character but the main problems are the story, the pacing, and the fight choreography which is pretty much why I watch Ip Man films",1466208000,,822,4.613793103448276

7610680,4,B01AU6P8XW,"In terms of martial art action, it has a lot to offer. Because we have seen so much great actions from the previous 2 movies, the audience expected something greater. I think it is difficult to do so. I enjoyed the fight between IP man and Tyson but his character is ludicrous. And how he has a little Chinese girl to pamper is kind of creepy. There was nothing establish on Tyson's relationship to the girl and possibly wife. Maybe she is a caretaker. It seems the moviemaker included Tyson for movie publicity's sake, similar to including a young Bruce Lee. But their characters don't enhance the storyline. I really like the relationship/storyline of IP man and his wife. I think they rekindled the spirit of the first movie. I do like how the rival's life differs from that of IP man. The contrasting lifestyle of IP Man vs the Rival brings freshness to the story. I think they should have explored that part of the story further. I don't think the 3rd movie can top the original one. The first one has a well balanced story and martial arts action. I like the movie quite a bit. As for the English dubbing, I can't expect top notch because in the history of Asian cinema, all the dubbing had been atrocious. So to grade it on a curve, the voice actors were fine EXCEPT for IP Man's voice. I am disappointed with the kind of voice that he had. The voice is supposed to command presence but it was wimpy. From the production standpoint, they probably spent a lot of money. So I was surprised they didn't find a decent voice actor for IP man.",1465776000,,1544,4.421052631578948

7610794,5,B01AU6P8XW,"Excellent Movie, highly recommend this action packed film.  Donnie Yen does it again.

Ip Man 3 is a martial arts film, the third in a trilogy, that chronicles the life of legendary martial artist Yip (Ip) Man, known most famously as the master who taught Bruce Lee.

If you haven't seen Ip Man or Ip Man 2, I highly recommend those as well.  The third films finds our hero, Ip Man (Donnie Yen), enjoying retirement and family life.  He spends his days raising his second son, Ip Ching, with his wife Wing Sing (Lynn Hung returning for the third film) and practicing his Wing Chun.  However, a local gang wants the property that Ip Ching's schools is built on and will stop at nothing to acquire it.

From there it only gets better, I highly recommend this film.

7610809,5,B01AU6P8XW,"This movie is excellent, a great addition to the Ip Man series, and one I will surely watch many more times in the future. Just like the first two movies in the series, there is an abundance of action-packed, well-choreographed fight scenes placed throughout the movie. Whether Ip Man is fighting one-on-one, or challenging a group of fighters at the same time, the action never slows down and you can feel the impact of the punches and kicks, which is something many other fighting movies fail to deliver consistently. Compared with the first two movies in the series, this movie fell somewhere in the middle. There was more of an emotional aspect like in the first movie, with more of an economically and nationally diverse setting as in the second movie. All of these factors combine to create a movie that at one moment will keep you at the edge of your seat during fight scenes, and perhaps even reaching for a tissue during the more emotional moments. This is a solid entry in the Ip Man series, be sure to add this one to your collection.",1463788800,,1045,4.593582887700535

I love these movies because they are great action and drama. One doesn't suffer for the other.

7610847,1,B01AU6P8XW,"The plot and story of this movie are total fiction! This is the worst of the Ip man movies. Donnie Yen's heart was not into it. Seems like someone (the Communist party?) pressured Donnie Yen into doing this movie after him saying that he would not do another Ip Man movie after #2. You can sense the animosity when they portray the English as evil and refer to them as ""Foreign Devils"" multiple times in the movie. Donnie Yen is always a good martial artist but my impression was that he was not 100% in this movie. The plot was right out of line of those old (very bad) Chinese movies of the early '60s or '70s--really stupid and simple minded. This movie is a lie!",1462579200,5,666,4.2936507936507935

7610882,5,B01AU6P8XW,I went into this sequel with low expectations.  Not because I don't love Donnie Yen or the series but because I wasn't quite sure how Mike Tyson was going to fit into the series and was worried that the quality of the writing might go down by the third iteration.  Well I was crying in the final scene so I am more than willing to admit I was wrong and worried  for nothing.  There are some great newcomers to Ip Man's story and you can't beat the Bruce Lee scenes.  An excellent addition to the series.,1461888000,,503,4.197916666666667

7610884,5,B01AU6P8XW,"I've never been a martial arts movie fan until I watched Ip Man.  The story of the Grandmaster resonated pure love of family, respect of the craft, sacrifice and hard work passed down through generations.  I love the grace of Wing Chun's movement and strength of commitment, it is pure magic watching. The war-torn struggle to maintain an existence during that time was inspirational. I loved how Ip Man 2 continued his incredible story between the martial arts world and his family life.  There was no mistaking how fierce Mrs. Ip was in her own right.  Ip Man 3 was exhilarating and heart-breaking.  The fight scenes in all 3 movies were masterfully choreographed, the theme of respect for the Chinese culture shines in every movie and Donnie Yen is brilliant in his portrayal of Ip Man.  I thought Lynn Hung perfectly portrayed Mrs. Ip. There is not enough space to say that every actor and crew involved with Ip Man, Ip Man 2 and Ip Man 3 deserves a 10-star rating.

Mike Tyson seemed out of place and did not make much sense as a villain in the movie, could have been better with another actor or as a random fight or challenger.

It does have CC - or closed captioning for deaf people which is similar - but the problem is unless you are a speed reader it is next to impossible to read the CC when streamed onto a HDTV.  Now, I watched part of the movie letterboxed widescreen on my computer with the CC and it was fine - showing up in the letterbox.  However on my HDTV steamed it was 16:9 non letterboxed - filling the screen.  The CCs were fast and hard to read and all over the lower part of the screen.  Also, subtitles are usually at the very bottom of the screen with plenty of time to read them vs CC is about 3/4's of the way down.  I got tired of trying to speed read the CCs.  Also, for an action film, there is a lot of dialog.  The film I'd give a 3-4 star if it had proper subtitles - not CCs.  I really enjoyed the IP series 1 and 2 - so I'm a bit upset that Amazon did not make clear that this has no subtitles and or that it is not dubbed.  I think there are dubbed versions of the earlier movies - I maybe wrong... but the successful movies from Asia are released in subtitles and English dubbed versions.  This one - obviously - the foreign distributor did not have the time or money to export it correctly....  If you can read fast CC - go for it... or watch it on your PC in Widescreen letterbox - that's fine... otherwise just know that watching it on an HDTV might be a bit challenging.

7610957,5,B01AU6P8XW,"Just some quick backstory
I absolutely LOVED the First 'Ip Man' film, it easily became my favorite martial arts film of all time,
it was a genera defying work with not just great action, but a well portrayed story too!

As for 'Ip Man 2' While they stepped up the action, it felt kind of like the second matrix movie,
Focusing way to much on visuals and action.
And while it was still way more entertaining then the second matrix film, and had great action, I still felt it did not live up to the first in any other acpect.

Now for the review!

Now we come to the third film in the Donnie Yen Ip Man Trilogy, It has a much stronger story then the second, with multiple simultaneous plot lines,
Yet offers good pacing, and some fights that rival, and even surpass some from the second AND first films!
However there are some odd choices in direction, and it seems like some content is not needed, it's still overall a great film.
While I'm not ready to say it's better then the first, it's still fairly close, and even though mike Tyson seems like an odd choice, they make it work,
And by the end you'll understand why he was chosen.

All-in-all, it's a great film that handles plot much better then many other martial arts movies, and if you liked the first or second Ip Man, you'll love this!
While you can watch this movie on it's own, and it's not technically 100% dependent on the others,
you should at least watch the first film before watching this.",1461110400,15,1456,4.361623616236162

7610959,5,B01AU6P8XW,"This is an incredible motion picture starring one of the top-rated Hong Kong wu shu actors, Donnie Yen. Add to that the flawless action choreography of Shun-Yee Yuen & Woo-Ping Yuen and you have yet another Masterpiece. If you like Chinese Martial Arts and WU SHU or XIA WU movies, this one is definitely a must for your library.  Special appearance by Iron Mike Tyson in his first action movie role makes it more special for American Boxing fans.

I would be remiss in failing to mention the many negative reviewers whining about the ""lack of subtitles.""  I purchased this movie from Amazon, and while it had no subtitles, all I had to do was turn on my CAPTIONS feature. Problem solved.

I watch movies in their native tongue as a matter of PURISM. After I watch it in the native language, I watch it with English to see what I might have missed. Generally, I missed nothing.  If the acting is good, you can deduce almost everything you need to know --- wait, okay --- you have to POSSESS the power of reasoning in order to be able to deduce from visual cues. I was wrong to think all adults possess that. What makes some of the whining even more sickening, is the fact that they blame Amazon, as if Amazon produced and packaged this movie. Oh well, as I said, I was WRONG to believe that all adults possess the power of reasoning. In this era, some people have have their hand held, and be fed by others; and have someone cleanse after making the pooh.  How sad is that???",1461110400,4,1475,4.404411764705882

Compared to the first two this one feels a little lower budget and has some pretty poor acting from the supporting cast (Mike Tyson was pretty bad in it, and his scenes were confusing/pointless).

If you liked the first two and just want to get the bad taste out of your mouth from those spinoffs (Final Fight, etc), this will do the job.",1461110400,,473,4.363636363636363

The first movie really showcases Donnie's prime as a martial artist rivaling  classics such as 'Fist of Legend', 'Drunken Master 2'.  Not sure if this movie has legendary status as the first adaption but is still an excellent movie and does have a strong message. Fun fact:  I remember reading that on set Mike Tyson was upset because Donnie broke his finger during their fight scene which I think is awesome.  Shows me how physical they really get in these choreographed fighting sequences.  Very impressive! A must for all who love the first two.

7610973,4,B01AU6P8XW,"Ip Man 3 is the final chapter in director Wilson Yips trilogy, starring Donnie Yen. This installment of the Ip Man saga takes place in 1959 Hong Kong and finds Ip Man (Yen) attempting to save his sons school from an intimidating property developer (Mike Tyson). With the police unable to help, Ip Man recruits his students to face off against the developers flunkies in an action-packed fight sequence that ends with the schools headmaster being kidnapped. After resolving this crisis, Ip Man faces another opponent in a fight to decide the true Grandmaster of the martial art Win Chun.

Yen portrays Ip Man as a proponent of peace and serenity. He is a center of calm amid chaos, an exemplar of purity and dignity in a corrupt world.  Of course, this man of peace with the powerful, lightning-fast fists and feet eventually gets into plenty of elaborately staged fights  the main draw of this franchise. The plot is merely an excuse for these fights and shouldnt be taken too seriously.

The movie peaks about two-thirds of the way through with the confrontation between the good guys and roughnecks terrorizing their community, making the final third, in which Ip Man looks after his wife as he contemplates a challenge from a loud-mouthed adversary, anti-climactic. Mike Tysons presence is initially distracting, but he delivers in his big fight scene.

For the first time in the series, this episode does not feature a fight to the death. Despite portraying violence as a failure of civilization, its terrific action choreography is the trilogys best attribute.

The film is presented in Cantonese, with dubbed versions in English, Spanish, and French. There are also optional English, Spanish and French subtitles. There are no bonus features on the widescreen Blu-ray release.",1460851200,9,1782,5.023728813559322

7610980,5,B01AU6P8XW,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I am consistently fascinated with the legacy Grandmaster Ip Man left behind.  Any martial arts master who is worthy enough to warrant three films about his/her life is certainly worthy of my interest.  And Ip Man certainly fits this criteria.  Many action fans are probably not familiar with him, although they owe him a debt of gratitude.  Ip Man was responsible for ushering in some of the greatest names in kung fu cinema, including the legendary Bruce Lee.

As such, I find it only fitting that a modern-day master portray him on film.  Donnie Yen, who has played the titular role in two films prior to this one, reprises his role as the iconic Ip Man, and he once again does so with expert ease.  IP MAN 3 is an excellent conclusion to this epic trilogy, and it is an excellent film even as a stand-alone.

I love everything about this film, and I don't say that very much when it comes to martial arts movies.  Some films have great action but boring plots; some boast interesting concepts but wooden characters; and, still some have cruddy fight scenes but nice scenery.  IP MAN 3 has a little bit of everything, including drama, humor, and most importantly, insane martial arts action.

IP MAN 3 is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, and the sets and locales are top notch.  I had no problem believing I was in 1950s China.

The acting in IP MAN 3 is excellent.  As mentioned, Yen gives a powerhouse of a performance as Ip Man.  But theres much more to Yens character than fighting.  In this film, Ip Man discovers his wife has cancer, and he devotes much of his time to her instead of fighting.  We get to see a tender, emotional side to Ip Man, and Yen offers this up with skill and expertise.  I was touched at how well Yen delved into the emotional aspect of the role.

But the fighting is sensational as well, thanks in part to Yuen Woo Ping, the mastermind action genius who deserves a biographical film of his own.  IP MAN 3 gives the viewer some of the best kung fu action around.  One fight scene in particular takes place in an elevator, where Ip Man must battle a Muy Thai fighter, while at the same time protecting his wife.  I love the intensity in this scene, and the hardcore action is heart-stopping.

IP MAN 3 is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend it.  This tremendous conclusion to the trilogy is a welcome addition, and I cannot wait to see what Yen does next.",1460419200,3,2504,4.424507658643326

The fight scene on part 3 seems more ""down to earth"" and realistic, providing another feeling rather than one man beating hundred men.
Is good, is awesome, realistic is always good and all the fight scene is pretty breath taking.
On part 3, the story evolved and with a lot more time spent on telling the story between him and his wife. (kinda slow but touchy, your wife will be touched by it)
The main plot continue where it left off, his name has established. kicking gangster butt to begin with then getting into the main part of the movie.
First will be the fight with Mike Tyson, good fight. Is not as long as I hope it would be, more like 3 minutes but is good.
Second will be the story and fight with Zhang Jin, a traditional wing chun martial artist, living a low life trying to raise a kid but still with good morale in him. The main conflict betwee him and Ip Man will be about Ip Man is taking all the credit as a hero and the legimaate of Ip Man's Wing Chun.
Zhang Jin is formal and traditional where Ip Man is modified, a battle for fame and who is the real master.

The addition of Mike Tyson seems very unnecessary, unless the writer was just trying to put something interesting into a poor script to draw more viewers, although all-in-all, Mr. Tyson did a decent job.

This one plays out not the way I thought it would.  Going into it I had reservations about Mike Tyson being cast as the central bad guy.  But the way it was put together--and the final sequence--really focused on pure martial arts.  A really enjoyable film that had my stomach in knots throughout much of it.

Donnie Yen returns again to reprise his very humble role as Ip Man. As hinted at the end of Ip Man 2, an apprentice emerges and leaves room for yet 1 more movie.
Ip Man must overcome various fighting styles, including ones that are reputed to be effective against Wing Chung and Donnie Yen ""handles"" them with powerful elegance.
Mike Tyson, even at his age, brings a force of nature with himself as he shows he's still got it.
As I said before, the music stood out to me and it sets the tone for the more emotional and the fast paced scenes and I felt that the original magic from Ip Man 1 has been tapped into once again.

You won't be disappointed. An actor who looks like Lee has a couple of cool scenes as well. If you enjoyed the first two films you will love this one as well. There is action, romance, and family themes throughout the film. Highly recommended. This film must be PG-13 the action/ violence is appropriate for teens.",1459555200,2,472,4.314606741573034

7610997,5,B01AU6P8XW,"Ip Man 3 brings back Donnie Yen, to reprise his role as the undefeated, machine-gun punching master of Wing Chun.  I was slightly wary while watching, because I wasn't a fan of Ip Man 2.  That second film, simply felt like a rehash of the first movie - Ip Man schooling his peers, and then fighting the foreign devil(s).  I was hoping this 3rd movie tackled a different antagonist/story, and for the most part, it does.

Keynotes:
- From my observations, the movie plays out into 3 distinct acts.  The first part revolves around a school.  The second part involves Chinese gangsters, and of course 'foreign devils'.  The final part is personal for Ip Man, and I felt it was the best segment of the film.

- Mike Tyson does have minor acting roles, and of course the anticipated fight scene with Ip Man.  While the acting sequences were forgettable, the versus scene was great.  Mike Tyson really shined as a boxing combatant, and held his own against Ip Man.

- Actor Jin Zhang, who plays Ip Man's main rival, is my highlight for this movie.  He plays a practitioner of Wing Chun, but with an opposing moral compass to Ip Man.  It was a joy to watch him lay the destruction to those who'd stand in his way, with remorseless efficiency.  I recognized him from this movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Zone-2-Blu-ray/dp/B01EIW5B3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Zone 2 [Blu-ray</a>], where he plays a formidable villain.  Also in a smaller role, Jin Zhang appears in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grandmaster-The-Blu-ray/dp/B00ET2ODX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grandmaster, The [Blu-ray</a>] as well.

- Ip Man's wife, actress Lynn Hung, plays a greater/memorable role in this film.

- A young Bruce Lee makes a few cameos.

In conclusion, I felt Ip Man 3 was a good continuation/(final?) of the Ip Man story, as portrayed by Donnie Yen.  The martial arts scenes, musical score, and visuals don't disappoint.  And priced at $12.99 from Amazon at this time of review, I gladly pre-purchased it to show my support and appreciation of the film.",1458000000,39,2137,5.341317365269461

7611001,3,B01AU6P8XW,"For years fans of Chinese matial arts star Donnie Yen have been waiting for him to finally break through in America. He's finally on the verge of doing that as part of Disney's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, but first he's taking one final bow in his most famous role, that of Wing Chun master Yip Man in Ip Man 3. For this latest collaboration with director Wilson Yip, Yen sends the franchise out on a high note by taking the legendary fighter through his most personal challenge.

In prior films Ip Man has battled Japanese and British occupying forces, but this one finds him in a war on the ground against American corruption, personified by boxing champ Mike Tyson. Tyson, looking built and menacing in a way he hasn't in years, plays the head of a local gang trying to take over a local school. Of course, Ip Man, defender of justice that he is, won't let this stand and defends the school day and night from thuggish invaders. But his fight for good comes at a personal cost as his wife Wing Sing (Lynn Xiong) grows ill and he's not around to take care of her, which puts a strain on their marriage. Meanwhile, he's also facing a new challenge from an ambitious wing chung master (Max Zhang) who thinks he better represents the style, which as most know was favored by Bruce Lee, one of Ip Man's real-life students. Man's connection to Lee is seen in a humorous intro in which the brash pupil (played by Danny Chan Kwok-kwan) is put through a near-impossible test to prove his worthiness.

These films have always been a balance between Ip Man's genuine exploits  and fictional martial arts action, but this being the last chapter of the story it makes sense to lean on his personal life. Screenwriter Edmond Wong manages to give this story, smaller in scope than previous installments, greater resonance by showing how Man resolves problems that he can't simply punch away. That said, the fights have greater stakes thanks to the great action coordinator Yuen Woo Ping, who previously worked on The Matrix, The Grandmaster, Man of Tai Chi, and many more.  Yen's clash against Tyson shows a perfect confluence of the actor's speed and grace with Woo Ping's energetic camera. What's interesting is the divergence of styles; the raw, brawling power of Tyson and the beautiful elegance of Yen's kung fu. If only that fight could have gone on longer, and if only Tyson's character had been better developed.

Yen has made it known that he may done with these kinds of action flicks as he's getting up there in age. It's the same kind of comment Jackie Chan has made, and we've seen him veer towards less physical roles ever since. If that's truly the case then Yen can at least say Ip Man 3 went out fighting like a true master.",1455667200,9,2731,4.576687116564417
