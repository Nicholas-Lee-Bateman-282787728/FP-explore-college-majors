683682,1,6303589146,"Well, for anyone familiar with the original there will be no question. For those unfamiliar here is the following...
The Toy is a disgusting remake of a remarkable French movie.
Choosing one or another you choose:
Either an outstanding performance of Pierre Richard or a mediocre one (at best) of Richard Pryor?
Either a classic or a remake.
Either intelligent, deep, touching, but very funny movie or a perfect example of bathroom humour.
It is always your choice. I hope you make the right one.
On the other hand, if you don't you get what you deserve.",1031097600,7,554,4.721649484536083
683683,3,6303589146,"I remember watching 'The Toy' as often as I could whenever it popped up on cable back when I was a young'un. For some reason, I found it unusually engrossing. Maybe it was the dumb hijinks of Richard Pryor and his spoiled-rich-kid 'playmate' (Scott Schwartz). Or perhaps it was Fancy's (Teresa Ganzel) gratuitous cleavage in every other scene she appeared in, thus kickin' up my prepubescent hormones a few notches. Whatever the reason, I made sure the channel clicker was set for the HBO channel whenever this silly little flick came on.
Looking at it as an adult, though, I cannot fathom what I ever saw in this movie. To me, the funniest part was the fact that Schwartz eventually ended up workin' in the porn biz. Actually, Ned Beatty dropping his pants on the orders of the kid's oil-tycoon dad (Jackie Gleason) in one scene was pretty entertaining too. It was sortuva tribute to his first pants-dropping role in 'Deliverance', which I consider one of the greatest unintentionally hilarious moments in cinema history. But, despite my bewilderment concerning my childhood enjoyment of 'The Toy', I'll often watch it whenever it pops up on cable, if for nothing more than the nostalgia factor.

683684,1,6303589146,being a Big Richard Pryor Fan it's hard to get into this film.seeing a Black Man used as Property for laughs&whatnot is not easy to take&therefore i avoid this film.it's not something worth watching it has a few ok moments but nothing worth talking about.,1002585600,6,255,4.688888888888889
683685,1,6303589146,"Anyone who doesn't cringe at the sight of the kid pointing at Richard Pryor in a store screaming ""I want the black one! The BLACK ONE!"" probably thinks that White Gentrification is worth considering. While Pryor  and Gleason occasionally rise above the material, the overall effect of the  kid treating a black man as a plaything is creepy and just plain gross. Why  didn't the producers just have the kid shoot caps and yell  ""DANCE!"" while Pryor did soft shoe and played the horn pipe? As a  sad footnote: Scott Schwartz, who played the kid, is now an adult film  star. I kid you not. Look on the IMDB.",950745600,6,604,4.495412844036697

Needless to say, this is one of those movies that you go back and watch several decades later and wonder why it's so great.  The acting is sub par and the plot unrealistic.  In this day and time, it's unreal to think that a child could ""buy"" someone as if they are a toy.  There are some good messages to this movie.  One being that it's important for parents to spend time with your kids.  You can't just buy them things and forget about them.",1454112000,,561,4.186915887850467

The plot: a rich, bratty, white kid wants to buy a black man for his birthday... as his toy.  Again this type of movie would never be made today with just the plot alone. However, as the plot unfolds with many many laughs at the pranks the child and Richard Pryor's character play on each other, this movie will warm your heart.  After the endless fighting between the two, a strong bond is developed.  He guides and mentors the child in how to properly treat people with respect and show them love instead of treating people like they our his ""toys"".

You either love it or hate the film and that's that.  We don't need a barrage of folks reviewing it, defending it or berating it.  If you feel the need to exercise your reviewing skills practice them over at RottenTomatoes.com or the IMDB.

Let's talk about what really matters:  The product itself!

This BluRay has little to add to the viewing experience over a DVD or VHS copy.  In other words, if you already own this in another format there is nothing to entice you into purchasing the film on Bluray.

-The transfer is mediocre at best.  It is vivid and clear at times.  However, at other times it's also extremely grainy.  Adding to that, I think the aspect ratio is slightly off as it seemed clipped at the top of the screen from the logos on.
-There are no extras.  (Unless you count scene selection as an ""extra."")

If you haven't bought ""The Toy"" before now, this is probably the best format you'll get at an affordable price.

And though I don't believe this film has to have the best possible picture to be enjoyed, with the lack of quality and Bluray features it's rather a disappointment.  Save a few bucks and rent it.",1374537600,4,1484,4.416974169741698

684132,5,6303589146,"In The Toy Pryor gets to stretch his acting skills somewhat and there's the crazy zany moments but there also some serious moments here too but not enough to turn this into a dramatic overload film. The film's premise has been criticized for it's subject matter, but I think if Richard thought at any point it was crossing the line or racists I'm sure he would've been the first one to walk away from it and let someone know at the sametime. He must have realized the humor of it all from the script or he would have never agreed to be involved in my opinion. The film is funny and moves at a pace that doesn't get bogged down or boring in any way. Richard's interaction with Scott Schwartz who plays 'Eric Bates' is great. Scott plays the spoiled rich kid to a 'T'. Jackie Gleason puts in a nice performance here as well. He plays a rich, pretentious windbag snob, and does it well. Ned Beatty is great here too, though his screen time is limited. Teresa Ganzel who plays ditzy 'Fancy Bates' really pulls off that 'Dumb Blonde' routine well without overdoing it. I searched for Blu Ray reviews on the interwebs before I made the purchase as I already have the DVD and didn't want to spend more money on a substandard transfer of it. The reviews I read were spot on and the Blu Ray looks fantastic and is easily an upgrade over the DVD version. One of my favorite Pryor films along with 'Moving' so getting this very clean and high quality Blu Ray version makes watching the film for the umpteen time so much more enjoyable than before.

684180,1,6303589146,"I finally saw the whole thing, after occasionally seeing parts of it on TV for years. Jackie Gleason and Richard Pryor were my favorite comedians, but this time they go together like ice cream and mustard.

The first half of the film is a sad parade of some of the most unlikable characters in a ridiculously stupid premise. A crude tycoon (Gleason) tries to buy his son's affection by offering him anything he wants. He picks an unemployed African American loser (Richard Pryor) as a toy. Pryor goes through some really degrading and sad ""comedy (pathetic abuse is more like it) at the hands of the bratty kid and the biogted father, before things are rectified (I won't spoil it by saying how) in the end.

Both of these otherwise great comedians' talents are squanderd here. Gleason is no Gigot, Ralph Kramden, or Poor Soul here. This is one of his flattest and unfunniest roles. His villany here is so coldly delivered that it is not even of the darkly comical moustache twirling Snidely Whiplash variety. At one particularly low point, the Gleason character (U.S. Bates) shows his power to Pryor by forcing his employee (Ned Beatty) to take down his pants during their conversation. ""That,"" says Gleason pointing to the degraded Beatty, ""is reality."" Are you busting your guts with laughter yet? Pryor even does a ""walk this way"" gag early in the film that was hoary even in Abbott and Costello's time.

Pryor is far below his best as Mudbone or Grover Muldoon who talked much trash and took no mess from anyone. Here, he is a pitiful simp of a man who whines and whimpers throughout most of the first 3/4 of the film. He continually returns to the degredation of the father and son's abusive antics when the Gleason character increases his pay. No dignity. More patheic than funny.

The kid is so obnoxious and unconvincing that it is difficult for the viewer to sympathize with his supposed lack of love at the hands of his unrelentingly mean father. We are expected to accept the idea that Pryor feels sorry for this monstorous brat and gets him to change his ways. Come on! This kid would make even Gandhi  and Martin Luther King go after him with a belt!

I've always said that bad drama can make for good comedy but band comedy is good for nothing. This is truly the case here unless you want to use the DVD for target practice at the rifle range.

Some people find this film funny. I am not one of them.",1325376000,4,2415,4.563510392609699

Out of Richard Pryor movies that I enjoy as an adult this isn't at the top of my list.  Don't get me wrong I still enjoy it, but I prefer Brewster's Millions more.

I can say that this is a movie you should share with your pre-teen child.  If they enjoy it as much as I did it would be a nice change of pace for viewing with them.

1. They actually make a movie where a rich white kid buys a black man for a toy.

2. They call the kid Master Bates.

3. The kid now does adult films.

This is one of the greatest comedies of all time. All that separates this from being one of the top three movies of all time is if they added a scene with Richard Pryor eating a bucket of chicken while the kid has intercourse with an adult film star while wearing a KKK outfit.",1161820800,3,453,3.9450549450549453
684281,5,6303589146,"In the early 80's, controversial African American comedian Richard Pryor (See No Evil Hear No Evil) was in top form. He was the most influential and electrifying stand-up comic, and one of the highest paid black actors in Hollywood (Pryor was reportedly paid $4,000,000 to appear in 1983's Superman III).

In 1982, Pryor agreed to star opposite the legendary Honeymooners star Jackie Gleason (Smokey And The Bandit), in a remake of a 1976 French film titled Le Jouet, which literally means The Toy in english. The outcome was a classic comedy, although hated by many critics, that is still enjoyed and quoted by people today.

The Toy is directed by Richard Donner (Superman), and also stars Ned Beatty (Superman), Wilfrid Hyde-White (My Fair Lady), Teresa Ganzel (Monsters Inc), and child actor Scott Schwartz (Kidco).

Pryor plays Jack Brown, a struggling and unemployed black writer who will lose his house if he fails to pay $10,000 to pay off his mortgage. Jack finds himself stooping down the social ladder trying to get any job he can get in order to save himself from getting thrown into the street. He finds a job as a cleaning lady for the Bates firm and is hired by Mr. Morehouse, played by Beatty. When local millionaire US Bates, played by Gleason, finds out that one of his cleaning ladies has a moustache, he fires him. To make matters worse, Bates's spoiled little bratty son 'master' Eric Bates, played by Schwartz, arrives in town for a week with his dad, goes to his dad's toy store, and picks out Jack as his toy because he made him laugh. Eric's insistence on keeping Jack and his dad's pampering reults in US negotiating a deal with Jack on the basis that he stays for a week at his mansion to keep his son company. US and Jack go on a collision course over different issues: the amount that Jack needs, US's degrading and racist new wife Fancy Bates, played by Ganzel, and most of all, what the film really focuses on, is how to approach and win over his son.

The Toy is a delightful movie despite what many regard it as being Pryor's and Gleason's low points. In fact, The Toy is one of the funniest films and an excellent pairing for both actors.

every single black/white stereotype is explored here... the black man needing to get a job.  the white women sexually flipping out at the sight of a black man (weird... gleasons secretary telling pryor that she'll give him a bath as she's trying to rape him)... as soon as a black man gets a job, he completely blows it with his incompetent behaviour... and the idea of a rich southern white kid wanting to own a silly black man all for himself is.... SHOCKING... if you are looking at it from the right perspective...  if tom hanks were to have starred in this flick, it would be a different story (...)... this is blatent racism that hasn't been seen since the 50's.

if you don't believe my comments, if you think i'm reading too much into a silly kids comedy, than go to the scene when pryor is being bought out in the toy store... that scene was incredibly offensive... here's pryor in the middle, with two wealthy white men on either side, shoveling large amounts of money in his hands with *gasp* A CONFEDERATE FLAG HANGING OVER RICHARD PRYORS HEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SURELY THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WEREN'T BLIND TO THIS.  SURELY THERE WAS SOME METAPHORICAL UNDERTONES THEY WERE TRYING TO GET ACROSS.

Some have objected to the story but if Pryor saw nothing wrong with the film I don't either.  This is one of those wonderfully silly comedies from the 80s that takes me back.  It's one of those films that's ""never quite as funny as all that"" but Pryor and Schwartz turn in good performances with eventually likeable characters.  The friendship they form is great.  Makes you feel good.
Scott Schwartz, who plays Gleason's son Eric, said he wrote a sequel himself but it's difficult to take him seriously for obvious (and painful) reasons.  He went on to do adult films but mostly as the comic relief.  You might remember him in A Christmas Story as the kid who sticks to the flagpole.
The anamorphic video on this DVD is top notch.  I was so happy because I'd never seen it in widescreen.  Some grain but this was most probably on the master copy.  The sound is good and clear 2.0 stereo.  I noticed an occational whine.
