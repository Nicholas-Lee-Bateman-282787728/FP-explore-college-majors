8043713,5,B0006VXLJ0,"A wildly unheralded Giant Robot Anime that was at least a decade ahead of its time. Dai-Guard a Giant Robot Comedy/Drama that focuses more on the employees and staff that make the fantastic work in a charming real world way. Think of it as the Office meets Pacific Rim. The basic plot is Alien Monsters appear, brought forth from an unknown dimension at the extreme pressures of tectonic plates. While rare occasionally a Fractal Core will pop through the rift and use local materials (water, ice, carbon etc) to grow into a giant monster. The only way to stop the monster is to destroy the core. And after a messy mishap with a WOMD the only way to do that is to get close and puncture them using a giant robot. So the world commissioned Dai Guard, the ultimate fighting robot... as built by the lowest bidder under government contract. The only problem? The monsters stopped coming for 15 years. So the robot got privatized, passed around, and ended up under the auspices of the Marketing Department, being used as a giant corporate mascot. When the Monsters return! So now the hopeless cubicle drones must pilot the giant monster, and fill out all the insurance paperwork afterwords in order to draw their meager salaries.

The show is hilarious, without being stupid or slapstick. It can be an occasionally dark realistic comedy, but always with a very upbeat or hopeful tone. It has a large cast of extremely likable characters, all well fleshed out with deep and believable character arcs. In short it is a Giant Robot Show where the Robot is the least interesting thing in the show, and it is wonderful. The robot itself is an engineering nightmare that barely functions on a good day. A huge hulking complicated monstrosity that requires constant support, management, assembly, dissasembly and the occasional good kicking.

If you are looking for something different and surprising look here. A great little unexpected show.",1454371200,,1932,4.869300911854103
8043714,4,B0006VXLJ0,"An inversion of the normal giant super robot anime, Dai-Guard is a walking pile of junk that's the only thing protecting Japan from total destruction. The show is full of well written humor, great characters that parody a lot of old mecha anime cliches. The show tries to inject some down-to-earth realism into a genre that usually tries to push the realm of fantastic as far as it can go.

As an added bonus it's pretty family friendly with minimal violence and adult themes. That doesn't mean it's for kids though as it's chock-full of references and other goodies and surprises for long time giant robot fans.

The series takes a comical look at super robots in the same way that Xebec's earlier series Martian Successor Nadesico did with ""real robot"" shows such as Gundam and Macross. The series also feels similar in tone to the Patlabor TV series which also explored the day to day life of pilots of fragile, realistic robots that often did more damage than they're trying to prevent.

It's laugh out loud funny watching the corporate suits that fund Dai-Guard flipping out as the mechanical giant causes unintentional destruction. The series also has it's more serious moments with rich character development that's often ignored in shows like this in favor of more action.

The animation and character designs are a bit generic but otherwise it's a fantastic show that's a lot of fun. A must see for fans of the genre. Just don't expect the super robot in this show to be too super.",1331164800,,1490,4.741312741312742
8043715,4,B0006VXLJ0,"Dai-Guard is, quite simply, one of the most entertaining series to be included in the ""Giant Robot"" sub-genre of anime, and is loaded with laughs.  While just looking at the title and picture, one may think its just a typical super robot show, it is, in reality, anything but.

In brief, the series is about a huge robot designed to fight invading monsters.  However, this particular robot is entirely owned and operated by a private corporation, and is piloted by three of its office staff.  Thus, the attacking monsters are just one of the problems faced by the protagonists, as they also have to deal with all the hassles and bureaucracies that come with working for any large company.  The vast amounts of humor that comes with juggling two seemingly completely disparate activities, saving the world and dealing with office work, is definitely one of the high points of the show.

Much of the show's humor also comes from the titular robot itself.  Despite looking like an archtypical Super Robot, Dai-Guard uses much more ""realistic"" physics than most other shows in the genre.  Thus, the robot is slow, clunky, and a complete hassle to operate.  Though it may look intimidating, the problems that plague the machine make it one of the most memorably inept robots to ever star in a series.

Though this does nothing to diminish the show itself, I would just like to mention that the actual quality of this box set was on the poorer side.  My copy of the case itself seemed to have been poorly put together, and began to fall about shortly after purchase.

While the series may not have as many memorable, over the top moments as others in the genre, it is just plain FUN.  It is sad that ADV's dissolution seems to have resulted in the series going out of print in the United States, but if you managed to get the opportunity to grab a used copy of the set, I highly recommend you take it.",1301529600,,1895,4.604166666666667
8043716,5,B0006VXLJ0,"Anime Lovers, Rejoice!!!  Finally there's a anime series you can watch with you significant other, or even teens without the embarrassing nudity, sexual situations, strong violence or excessive profanity.  It's Dai-Guard!

This is one of the few anime series I could actually immerse myself in.  The characters are true-to-life complete with emotion.  The situations seem almost realistic, and the comedy isn't really ""cartoony"".  This is one of the best, under-rated and under-appreciated anime series out there.  Please give this one a try...it will not disappoint and you can share it with the family.",1255737600,,604,5.43010752688172
8043717,5,B0006VXLJ0,"Has more of an americanized feel to it, but it is still a very good anime that will not bore you, I would call it a more kiddy evangelion.  But still fun enough for teens to watch.",1183248000,,180,3.864864864864865
8043718,5,B0006VXLJ0,"Dai-Guard is a robot fighting alien anime. Beside the fightings, there are some unsolved problems exisitng in the characters. Lots of problems come up, then how can the characters resolve their own problems while desperately fighting the monsters in the story? This is the hightlight in this anime. It is realistic; the life in the story is just similar to what we are having daily. You do not find special power or intelligence in the robots, the pilots or anything else. I give it 5 stars because an ordinary background, characters and other components can lead to such a magnificient story in this anime production.",1173916800,2,618,4.895238095238096
8043719,5,B0006VXLJ0,"Dai-guard has it all.  it is very family oriented with giant robot.  What more can you ask for.  Unlike other giant robot or anime in general, there are no big breasted women or bloody scenes where people getting their body blown up.

Instead it keeps it all real and shows the aftermath of destruction and how fragile we all are.  And the character development is extremly well with top notch animation (given it was aired on TV)

I was hooked to finish the series really quick.  The ending is awesome.  And from a sci-fi geek point of view, this series is even better.  It actually explains why only Japan gets all the big bad monster rather than anywhere else.  Watch and find out!",1129161600,9,684,4.487804878048781
8043720,5,B0006VXLJ0,"dont be swayed by the three star and under reviews given to this underappreciated gem.to tell u the truth i have not laughed this much durring an anime in a while( and i watch a lot of anime.)what truely sets this one appart is the undenieably lively and easy to get humor, sure it may get a bit dry but it is rare. futher more the giant robot battles sem to be a mix of old school mech design with new school animation techniques and directon. characters are not over the top like some of the other show out there and that is defiinitely a plus...............enjoy!",1116201600,11,566,4.349056603773585
8043721,5,B0006VXLJ0,"I've seen the whole series. It's definitely one of my favorites. It has a lot of the usual giant robot anime elements, but it's very different from others you may have seen. Ever wonder what it would really be like if a real company operated one of these giant robots? This anime presents that idea as this old robot is brought online, after a number of years, to combat monsters that start to appear and attack Japan. It has a good mix of humor and seriousness and is worth checking out whether or not you're just getting into anime.",1111449600,7,534,4.404040404040404
