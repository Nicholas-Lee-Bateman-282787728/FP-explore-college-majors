8254340,5,B00144VHTY,"WoW....To have watched this very touching documentary about a former stripper, Heather,  now ""turned on"" by God and telling other strippers and porn industry folks about the love of Jesus Christ was to have been blessed by God!  And to observe the drama of how some in her church didn't support her or were dead against it, how some letters to her were hateful, and how she and fellow gals persevered, going to clubs and conventions and handing out Bibles and shirts and creatively packaged items, all while looking hot-but-not-in-a-slutty way...it was beautiful!  Then to see how her pastor was taught the deeper meaning of love for the world by her, to watch him very seriously ask his church whether they would support this kind of outreach effort philosophically or else he would have to leave?!!  Tears were rolling down my face while witnessing this display of such love for humanity....I think Heather and he ""got"" how awesome God's love is!  I am proud of Heather, proud of the pastor, proud of the family and friends who are supporting them wherever they are!

The Christian Church as well as the World overall are much better places because of them!",1250121600,2,1159,4.798994974874372
8254341,5,B00144VHTY,"This is a superb movie that every Christian should watch. It forces you to look at your own attitudes to those with a different background to yourself, and challenges every church to come up to Jesus' standard.
Heather is an inspiration to anyone serious about spreading the gospel.",1211068800,2,282,4.895833333333333
