8348953,5,B0021FP2RI,"This is a wonderful collection!  We watch one every day!  I am not much of a Western fan, but I see that is changing as I watch these.",1357171200,,134,3.75
8348954,3,B0021FP2RI,"A few before hand old series I'd not heard of. For the most part the collection covers all of that genre. A nice addition to my DVD collection, a when I'm in the mood to watch a particular episode, its' there for me to do so.",1305158400,,225,3.9130434782608696
8348955,5,B0021FP2RI,"I've watched the entirety of Disk l and selections in other disks and can't imagine why some other reviewers were so displeased.  It's true that some of the programs, especially the b&w episodes, are a bit fuzzy, but those were shot about 50 years ago when the equipment was not as good as it is now.  Movies for theaters then were filmed better, to be sure, but TV shows then, at least on the sets I watched, were no match for the clarity today's.

As for the programs themselves they are just as I remember, with some new series I had never seen.  In all there are over 40 samples from different series.  I had forgotten that there were so many,eg. ""Tumbleweed"" amd ""Sheriff of Cochise.""  None was of the Pulitzer Prize variety, not even close.  The endings are predictable.  The women are slender, busty and fashionably dressed.  The towns are idyllic.  Any serious student of the Old West, as it actually was, will roll his eyes at these, but they are representative of the TV fare of the era.

Somehow we never expected as much from TV programs as we did from theater movies we paid to see.

All in all, I would certainly recommend this set for those nostalgic for TV in those early years.  The price is certainly fair and the programs are lots of fun.",1291939200,4,1257,4.436681222707423
8348956,3,B0021FP2RI,"I bought these at Sam's Club for just over $15.00. I would NOT pay anymore than that since the quality is 2nd rate for many episodes. But there are many shows that are of OK quality and depending on your TV reception back in the 50s and 60s, these might look great!
Anyway, buy at your own risk but I think for what I paid it was a good deal. It might even be worth more to some.",1257984000,7,379,3.871794871794872
8348957,1,B0021FP2RI,"I love classic TV and Movie Westerns -- I hate this boxed set!

I gave it one star to represent the badge of a western sheriff who is currently on the trail of the outlaws who produced it!

I fell for the advertising the produrcers put out that the quality of the DVDs was good, and that they had taken the material from actual archival footage. What a laugh! The episodes and movies contained on the discs, almost without exception, look like 10th generation VHS knockoffs (and that's giving them too much credit)!

For the price, Timeless Media Group should be tarred and feathered and run out of town! If you want rooting-tooting classic westerns (and who doesn't?), go elsewhere. If you want to be held up by masked bandits armed with six-shooters like I was, then go ahead and buy this set.

The worse disappointment for me was the inclusion of an episode from the TV Classic The High Chaparral. Rarely, as ANY episode from this incredible series been released on an authorized DVD. Well, it was an awful copy of the public domain episode, Shadow of the Wind -- one of two episodes from the series ever released on VHS. And to add insult to injury, it was in Black and White, not in color as it had been aired!

I do want to be fair -- there is ONE thing good about the set: the cool packaging. The discs are enclosed in a tin box. (Now that I think about it, perhaps they should have been included in a PINE box instead!)",1243468800,54,1427,4.369811320754717
