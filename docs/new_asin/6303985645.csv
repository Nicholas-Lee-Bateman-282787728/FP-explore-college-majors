763806,5,6303985645,"THE ANNIVERSARY is a fabulous little movie based on the play of the same name by Bill Macilwraith.  Bette Davis is in her element in the kind of role she plays best, and is joined by a strong supporting cast.

Mrs Taggart (Bette Davis), is a controlling and fearsome woman not to be trifled with, as her three sons (Jack Hedley, Christian Roberts and James Cossins) know all-too-well.  Every year she has maintained the ritual of inviting her sons home to celebrate her wedding anniversary, which is really just an excuse to tighten her ever-present grip.

The script is loaded with juicy quips and insults.  Bette Davis has a ball with the role of one-eyed mother-from-hell Mrs Taggart, with Sheila Hancock (repeating her original stage role) as the acid-tongued daughter-in-law, and Elaine Taylor as the bewildered girlfriend of the youngest son.

Highly-recommended!",1099785600,6,869,5.084507042253521

The simple plot revolves around Ms Taggert's (Bette Davis) yearly tradition of celebrating her wedding anniversary even though her husband has been dead quite some time.  Not only does she insist on comemorating the occasion but DEMANDS that her sons, ALL of whom have their own issues with Mother Dear, attend along with their respective families.  Then Bette proceeds to tear into them unmercifully because she knows they will put up with it all for the sake of good ol' moola!  Knowing this, Bette pulls no punches and delivers one of the funniest, most brutal, scathing, lowdown, and over-the-top CLASSIC performances in film history.

763810,4,6303985645,"Hmmm...""The Anniversary."" For some reason, I like this film, though it's neither fish nor fowl. Marketed as a horror movie, in the Bette Davis vein, but actually a snippy ""comedy of manners,"" ""The Anniversary"" is a property desperately in search of an identity. Rest assured, this is Bette's show all the way. She completely and UTTERLY dominates the action, whether snidely putting down a guest (""would you mind sitting somewhere else, dear? Body odor offends me"") or reducing her three grown sons to mounds of jelly, she's in the driver's seat. And that's the problem. No other cast member can even come close to Ms. Davis...and when they attempt to, it's like a flame approaching a hurricane!  Guess who wins! ""The Anniversary"" was a stage play, veddy British in tone, with Mona Washbourne as the dreadful one-eyed mother, Mrs. Taggert. Bette is miscast, sad to say...obviously American, with children and ""loved ones"" who are decidedly British, and it's an odd misstep. Then, there's the lack of a musical score. There's not one note of background music, aside from the credits and the playing of ""The Anniversary Waltz"" on an old victrola. In between the hollering (and there's a lot of that), there's nothing to fill up all those empty pauses.  Perhaps if there'd been a laugh track tacked onto the film, we'd no where to laugh...but honestly, Bette's remarks are so outrageously nasty, it's difficult to find any humor in them. The film just goes on and on, without any real point. Oh, I suppose it's really a twisted essay on ""Mother Love,"" because--in the end--Bette keeps her ""chicks"" close. But none of the ""boys"" are interesting, so why would she want those bores around? There's beleaguered family man Terry, saddled with a constantly pregnant Cockney wife; fat, ineffectual transvestite son Henry (and we never see him don so much as a frilly bathrobe), and the worst of her lot--Austin Powers wannabe, Tom (grungy teeth and all!). So, why, with all this criticism, do I like ""The Anniversary?""  Well, for one, it's a Hammer Film, for another, it's BETTE DAVIS!

763811,4,6303985645,"This is a surprisingly deft black comedy with Bette Davis at her most wicked. The screenplay by Jimmy Sancster, which  is adapted from a play written by Bill MacIlwraith, retains the flavor of a stage play.
Bette Davis plays the role of Mrs. Taggart, the wealthy, flamboyant, one eyed, matriarchal head of a family of three grown sons, all of whom kowtow to her every whim. She knows all their weak points and uses her knowledge to check mate them and head them off at the pass, should they get any ideas about getting out from under her thumb.
Though her despised husband has been dead for ten years, she still celibrates her wedding anniversary by having her three sons home for a celebration, and a motley crew they are, indeed. When they show up this year for the anniversary celebration, however, they decide to shake up old mom by making a break for freedom from her rule. Trust me, this will cost them dearly.
Bette Davis is outrageous and lights up the screen, as she hams it up delightedly. The dialogue is rapier sharp and brilliantly witty, allowing Ms. Davis to dazzle as she chews up the scenery. Looking every inch the fabulous doyenne that she is, she wears an eye patch color coordinated to match every one of her colorful outfits.

763880,1,6303985645,"When I first saw The Anniversary on Amazon I thought I had found the lost treasure of all Bette Davis' career. WRONG! This film is the most humilating piece of movie trash anyone has ever starred in never mind our most precious Bette. The eye patch is horrendous. The outfits are horrific. The plot? Is there one that holds up to anything that a clown  couldn't play. I can't even sit through it again. I had to force myself to watch it the first time. What could have been a quite intriguing plot is instead a thrown together script to embarass our legendary Bette: yellow teeth and all. I felt like crying I was so upset for Bette. There are no great lines to recite. There are no shocking moments. This certainly is no treat for a Bette Davis fan and I am one who counts myself as an adoring fan.
If the releasing company would be so kind to burn all the inventory and put it out of circulation and out of it's misery that would be the kindest act. But they'll keep suckers like me thinking I've come across a gem for the money honey. Bette certainly was used and made to think the film had some importance. Alas, even my TV cried having to carry the picture through.
Please don't waste your money when there are so many of her fabulous films available on DVD. I gave it one star for our star Bette. May she rest in peace and this film rest in pieces of a recycle bin. It is a crime that some greedy folks put it out. Shame on them.",1224547200,4,1435,4.199275362318841

Bette wiggles her way through this one, spewing honeyed venom at the cast and changing her eyepatch to suit her outfits.  She also makes up for the lack of one eye by allowing the other one to upstage the rest of her- it widens in such mascara-laden shock so often one is afraid it will pop out and shoot across the room.

763883,3,6303985645,"""The Anniversary"" is certainly engaging, but it's also somewhat depressing.  The vitriol and narcissism fly from all directions, not just from Bette Davis' ""Mother from Hell"" character (though she does get the top award in the ""reprehensible"" category here).  But if you can take all the hate, the movie delivers good banter, some funny moments, and a nice sheen of sophistication.  You could certainly do worse things for ninety-five minutes or so than watch this movie.

A quick word about Ms. Davis' performance in ""The Anniversary"".  Some here have called it hammy and over-the-top, but I didn't find it so.  I think that Ms. Davis wisely saw that the material was often outrageous, over-the-top, etc., so she didn't need to be.  She just calmly delivered her lines with just the right emphasis and underscoring and let the material basically speak for itself.  I found it to be a nicely modulated performance.

The commentary track, featuring director Roy Ward Baker; an executive from Anchor Bay Entertainment (the DVD company); and one of the film's producers, is also a lot of fun, mainly due to the fact that it's so candid.  The word ""battleaxe"" is actually used to describe Ms. Davis' personality on the set.  But the producer and director also say nice things about her, which come off as credible because they didn't hold back on the bad stuff.

The film print employed here is sharp and clear, and the colors are vibrant.  Kudos to Anchor Bay for producing such a nice DVD... even though it inexplicably included a number of low-rent horror trailers at the start of the program.  Hey, I know that ""The Anniversary"" was a Hammer Film, but it wasn't THAT kind of Hammer film.

I think Bette Davis fans will enjoy this lesser known effort from the late 60's.  But, like I said at the outset, don't look for a warm and fuzzy take on humanity here.",1196726400,4,1857,4.75625

763941,5,6303985645,"Bette Davis stars in The Anniversary, a black campy comedy from the 1960s. She is ably assisted by other supporting actors; and if you like movies that are somewhat off the beaten path, this one's for you!

When the action starts, Mrs. Taggart (Bette Davis), the wealthy and highly manipulative matriarch of the Taggart family, demands that her three sons help her ""celebrate"" her anniversary to their father--even though he's been dead for ten years. Of course, this being a Bette Davis vehicle, the three sons aren't exactly the strongest. Henry (James Cossins) is a cross dresser and rather wimpy; and her other son Terry (Jack Hedley) doesn't have much backbone either. The youngest son Tom (Christian Roberts) brings his pregnant fiance Shirley (Elaine Taylor) along for the celebration, which is sure to cause some friction.

Well, if you read that insults fly and family secrets become public information, you read correct information. Mrs. Taggart, who is so wicked and cold that she isn't even given a first name by the writers, carries on throughout the evening like a woman obsessed with humiliating and manipulating people as things as well as events so that she can always stay close to her three sons.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Will Mrs. Taggart get her way the whole night long? Will any or all of her sons ever stand up to her? What about Terry's wife Karen--will she stand up to Mrs. Taggart? What will Mrs. Taggart do when she finds out Tom's fiance is already pregnant? No spoilers here, folks--you'll have to watch the film to fine out. This film offers up some good suspense as it is anyone's guess how the movie will end.

The plot moves along at a good pace and it held my attention very well. I liked the cinematography with its good shots of the Taggart residence from many different angles; and the choreography works well in scenes when the Taggart family eats dinner in a restaurant and sets off fireworks to liven up the ""celebration.""

This movie, a must have for Bette Davis fans, gives us a campy black comedy that really is one of the better ones in this genre of film. I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys Bette Davis or this type of somewhat psychological piece.

763944,2,6303985645,"THE ANNIVERSARY is perhaps the most unusual film in Bette Davis' filmography. Coming after three fine ""horror"" thrillers, this one often gets pegged as another entry in the category (and was marketed as one by 20th Century-Fox who clearly was at a loss at how to sell it), THE ANNIVERSARY is actually a black comedy-melodrama with Davis playing such a monster mother she makes Gladys Cooper in NOW VOYAGER look like Stella Dallas in comparsion.  Davis stars as Mrs. Taggart, owner of a construction company who keeps her three ineffectual adult sons on a tight leash.  Unfortunately, the director failed to do likewise to Miss Davis but she can scarcely be blamed when the screenplay dares her to overact.  Surprisingly successful playing a British matron (she does have the bad teeth for the role),  Bette has a ball (and certainly a major segment of her audience will as well) but the bad taste and bad manners wears thin before long and the storyline, whatever it is, is just not interesting.

The movie is strong on outrageousness but weak on credibility, stunningly vicious remarks or actions are overlooked as if nothing happened moments later.  Some of the insults are funny but the laughs are surprisingly few in this picture which has long stretches of melodrama.  On the plus side there are two young actresses, Sheila Hancock and Elaine Taylor, who do very well and are able to stand up not only to Mrs. Taggart but to Bette Davis.  The sons, unfortunately, are written off as drips although the hopelessly dominated middle son is well played.

THE ANNIVERSARY was for years a little seen film and television airings have always been extremely rare probably due to it's adult humor (although you will now see rougher stuff on TV cartoons).  It's hard to miss in Bette Davis books with it's stills of Davis in a eyepatch or clutching a pissin' statue and I suspect many Davis fans have sought it out on video and DVD sight unseen.

This movie was apparently a bomb at the box office and started the most elusive chapter in Davis' career, 1968-1975 where she made some scarcely seen films like ""Connecting Rooms"", ""Bunny O'Hare"", and ""The Scientific Cardplayer"" as well as a few instantly forgotten TV projects.  Bette Davis, like Mrs. Taggart, did not know the meaning of conceding and marched on and actually found a number of worthwhile and well-received projects in her senior years from 1976 until her death in 1989.",1152403200,17,2430,4.828915662650602
763945,4,6303985645,"You really have to hand it to the Movie Divas of yesterday, don't you?

I mean, when faced with financial and professional stagnation, what did they do? Go on Oprah and whine about bankruptcy? No. Turn to drugs and make enormous fools of themselves in the National Press? No chance. Did they suddenly discover a 'cause' to get themselves back in the spotlight, in vainglorious hopes of getting more movie roles sent their way? Nope. Or did they even retire graciously and quietly, living out the winters of their lives in seclusion and silence? Oh, my, but no.

They made movies like this one!!

Joan Crawford did 'Trog' and 'Berserk', Lana Turner appeared in 'Madame X' and 'The Big Cube', Shelley Winters had 'Cleopatra Jones' and a string of memorable TV appearances, and of course, La Bette Davis made, among others, 'The Anniversary'.

For which I, for one, will be eternally grateful.

'The Anniversary' isn't a great movie in terms of supporting cast, direction, or script. Even the production design is a little flat, a little stagey. But Bette shines - absolutely radiates star power - in this oftentimes-slow twilight years Star Vehicle, as Mrs. Taggart, the revoltingly machiavellian Matriarch of the highly dysfunctional Taggart clan. Gathering her sons and their other halves together on the occasion of her fortieth wedding anniversary, Mrs. Taggart, when faced with filial mutiny, does her level, manipulative best to put a stop to all forms of dissention, including disinheriting her grandchildren, turning her eldest cross-dressing son over to the police, and trying to frighten her would-be daughter-in-law into miscarrying her unborn child.

Sounds pretty grim, on paper - but Davis' perfectly pitched high camp performance saves this movie from being simply another late sixties melodrama. I mean, you'd hardly expect to find such a steel-willed woman playing with a Mannekin Pis-shaped watergun or french-kissing her youngest son in front of his siblings, but there you go: Davis clearly knew that she could have fun in this role, and have fun she does - and we're thrilled to be along for the ride.

Bette Davis is in truly magnificent form as the mother from Hell in this bitter and twisted British black comedy classic.

Davis stars as Mrs Taggart, a widowed mother with three sons. Once a year, on her wedding anniversary, the entire family gathers to pay her respect - and to endure her cold sarcasm and malicious interference in their lives. There's Henry, the unmarried eldest son with his strange lust for women's undergarments; Terry and his wife Karen, desperate to escape to Canada; and youngest son Tom and his new (and pregnant) fiancee.

Old Mrs Taggart may only have one eye, but she can unerringly spot their most vulnerable points that will use any method to crush them - from pretending her own grandchildren have been maimed in a car crash to trying to kill her daughter-in-law through unending pregnancies. Tonight, as the family gathers, the fight is once more...

Deliviously dark and wickedly funny. The Anniversary will make you see your family in a whole new light...

I'm a big Bette Davis fan and I've been working my way through her filmography for a while now. I've put off buying this because it's been expensive compared to the multitude of other BD films available, but curiosity got the best of me and I plunked down my twenty something bucks.

I'd expected it to be one of those so-bad-it's-good films, but it's not. It's just bad.

It's -almost- like a John Waters film. Everyone overacts. The dialogue is all taken to the extreme. The production values are sorely lacking. There are no sympathetic characters. Everyone is detestable for a variety of reasons. Bette isn't funny or clever. She's just mean. The big differerence is that John Waters could have made it work.

Looking back at the review I just wrote, I'll admit that if someone else had written this it would not have stopped me from buying this DVD. It would have piqued my interest. ""Oh, it couldn't be that bad!"" I would have thought. Well, it is.

7859501,5,6303985645,"Bette Davis is excellent in this movie . It shows a mother who is warped and how she controls people.

I think they call that being set free.",1400889600,,321,4.015625
