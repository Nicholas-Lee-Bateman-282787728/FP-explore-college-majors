915988,3,6304696698,"Our family is a fan of Tim Conway's Dorf. We enjoyed this movie, but not nearly as well as his others. This one has some great scenes, but they are countered with scenes that tend to repeat the same gag a bit too much. Some  of the content seems to try too hard to be funny, and some just is not  funny. We did not find the name calling and spouse fighting worth a repeat  watch. If you desire a complete set of Dorf videos, you should add this to  your collection. If you are out for one great Dorf video, this is not it.",960768000,10,522,3.942857142857143

My grandson just discovered the joys of fishing so I used Amazon to get him completely geared up, and I ran across this video and figured it would be a fun thing to add on. It didn't have quite the effect I was hoping for. If I had the chance to go back in time I would not order it.",1430697600,,337,3.76056338028169
