741664,2,6303900909,"...but the weird part is that, based on the last third or so, it was inspired heavily by Sergio Leone's brilliant ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (which you ought to check out) -- in just the part i saw i caught at least four or five references to the soundtrac from that film, particularly the wailing harmonica phrase that cued the entrances of the Mysterious Avenger and the almost-identical endtheme with soaring wordless soprano vocals as she rides away. ((They also used a shot of Claudia Cardinale's theme from ""OUaTitW"" for the younger girl)).
Apparently the main bad guy has no idea why this girl is hunting him down, but -- again as in the Leone -- as he dies he finally sees a flashback that gives it to him.
I'm going to have to try to catch the whole thing and see just how closely it actually resembloes the Leone...
UPDATE AS OF 8/23/2001:
I have seen the whole film.  It is, indeed, basically an uncredited remake of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", with added elements highly reminiscent of ""High Plains Drifter""

741665,4,6303900909,"I'd watch Kathy Long in anything she cares to take the time to make. OK, she's no acting threat to Geena Davis or Meryl Streep, but she did her best and it wasn't bad. Certainly no one can fault her performance of her  martial art. She kicks some serious ass on the bad guys and does it  beautifully! I don't know that Long exceeds the skill of Cynthia Rothrock,  but she's certainly an equal. You've gotta love the scene where Long  mirror-images the Tai-Chi kata being done by Angel (Andrew Divoff).
The  only other film in which I believe Ms. Long has appeared in a starring role  is ""Knights"" with Kris Kristofferson, although she did appear in  the Catwoman costume, standing in for Michelle Pfeiffer on the very  physical stunts in ""Batman Returns"". I'd certainly make a point  of watching more if she'd only make 'em.
Ginger Lynn Allen didn't do  badly in this one, either, playing Sally, the hardware store owner. Again,  no serious threat to the Oscar nominees, but considering her background in  porn films (aka ""Ginger Lynn"") she did OK. It's a nice change  from stuff like ""Vice Academy I, II, III and/or whatever"",  essentially soft-porn with dialogue.
I have a copy of this movie taped  from a TV broadcast that's not great. I'd like to buy a better one but not  at this price. Get the price down to something reasonable and I'll be first  in line.
(Gotta do something with that photo of the box; the clothing on  that model is nothing like Long's gear in the film, and she doesn't even  resemble Long that much. She never had a shotgun, either, that was Angel's  weapon.)",934848000,19,1586,4.576512455516014
741666,4,6303900909,"Kind of a modern day ""High Plains Drifter"" Long never says who she is but you get the impression that she's the murdered girl come back to get revenge. What Long lacks in acting ability she makes up for in martial arts  skills. Perfect location for this story to unfold. Long has this sly  sexiness about her that just keeps you glued to the screen. I'd watch her  over Cynthia Rothrock any day!",929318400,6,395,4.383561643835616
7857195,4,6303900909,"Okay, let's face it, Kathy Long is not a great actress, but this movie really kicks butt. The martial arts fighting style in here is very good and it has a solid story line too. I saw this year's ago on cable and recorded it on the tape, which has now seen better days. I hope they release a DVD version of this movie soon.

I am a huge fan of Ms. Long, I would love to have this movie on DVD, hoping that happens soon, and at a reasonable price.

7857204,3,6303900909,"The queen of American kickboxing, Kathy Long, reached the zenith of her uneven acting career with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yojimbo/dp/0780022513/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yojimbo</a>-derivative all her own. While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knights/dp/6302914124/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knights</a>&nbsp;was arguably her first vehicle, she was supported there by a good collection of established costars, whereas in ""The Stranger"" - with no household names among the supporting cast - the weight of the film is clearly upon her shoulders. The results of this are pretty mixed. I popped in the tape expecting to see a good action movie some window dressing plot, but instead found a fairly decent pseudo-western with not enough action scenes for my taste. Seeing as the glut of Long's fans would probably be in this to see her kick some serious butt, the movie could easily come as a major disappointment, but I hope most viewers leave themselves open to enjoying the other factors of the film - you may just have a good time.

The story: a lethal and mysterious woman on a motorcycle (Long) rides into a small western town oppressed by a violent biker gang, looking for a showdown with its leader (Andrew Divoff,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wishmaster/dp/0784011141/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wishmaster</a>) to settle some uncertain score.

Long is just about perfect for a role like this: though not the best when it comes to acting, she has the presence, temperament, and real-life toughness to get her part across, and despite the presence of a single bedroom scene, she never *needs* to resort to blatant sex appeal. On her motorcycle, wearing her sunglasses, she looks like a lady Terminator. The other performers sort of play around her, and generally do a good job with their roles. There's Eric Pierpoint (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Nation/dp/B000WLU5ZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Nation</a>) as the sheriff and Long's eventual ally, child actress Robin Heath (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angus/dp/B0047E5GHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angus</a>) as a traumatized girl she forms a bond with, and a trio of almost comically inept antagonists - Ash Adams, Hunter von Leer, and adult film actress Ginger Lynn - who think the town would be better off under biker rule and thus try to thwart the heroine (actually a pretty well-played plot point). The writing allows for some decent character exploration, making it possible to care about all these guys even when things get slow.

The fight scenes aren't slow, but I almost wish they were, since they're over so quickly! There are six cases wherein Kathy engages her opponents hand-to-hand, but only two of these exceed ten seconds in length. There are some instances where these quick kills are kind of neat (watch for a painful bottle-to-the-mouth for Nils Allen Stewart), but more often than not, Long looks uncomfortable with choreographed punches. The final showdown with Andrew Divoff is better than I'd imagined, but I was hoping for more. More fighting, that is, but also more out of the movie's final act: one of the major faults of the writing is how much Divoff's character is hyped up as a hell raiser for most of the of the film, but when he shows off,  he's not particularly anything special.

Kathy Long was never in line to become the next Cynthia Rothrock, I think, but with her recent return to film, I'm holding out for the possibility that she secures another starring vehicle and tops this effort. Finding ""The Stranger"" for a reasonable price around here is impossible for the moment, but if this sounds like it'd interest you and you can snatch it cheaply, go ahead and you probably won't regret it.",1379376000,,3924,5.7353951890034365
