4312837,5,B004AZ7ZLI,"Such a young Tommy Lee Jones is stunningly expressive in this movie where he says almost nothing.  His movements and actions are telling enough.  Yvette Mimeux ,(bad spelling), was also amazing in her role as a victim in a jail cell next to the jail cell of Tommy Lee jones.  Yvette defends herself in a powerful and rare scene of a woman standing up for herself in this era, and kills a prison guard who is violating her.  Enjoyed this cult classic very much.",1415836800,,460,4.440476190476191
4312838,5,B004AZ7ZLI,These are the films that aren't made like that anymore. I love the time period of the 70's. Totally Classic!,1363478400,,108,4.45
4312839,5,B004AZ7ZLI,"Finally after all these years it is good to finally get Jackson County Jail in widescreen DVD. The VHS I have of it is worn out and looked horrible. I am shocked they double billed it with Caged Heat. What was Shout! thinking? These two movies are totally different from one another. Jackson County Jail should have been released on its own, because there is no other low budget movie like it. It shouldn't even be catagorized as a 'women in prison flick'. Don't get me wrong Caged Heat is a good movie in it own right, but not up to the standard of Jackson County Jail. Watching this I now realize why Tommy Lee Jones became the phenominal actor he has become. To me, he steals the show!
Dont't expect a whole lot out of this title for special features, but hey both movies are anamorphic widescreen and they look pretty good for the low budget movies they are.",1303862400,12,862,4.39375
4312840,4,B004AZ7ZLI,"Jackson County Jail / Caged Heat is a pretty cool, but not quite awesome, prison double feature. Both of the movies included here are good, but neither are the best of the genre. Caged Heat is the better of the two, simply because it wears its b-movie heart on its sleeve. And it has a lot of nudity, including bush. We love bush! A good pick-up if you are a Roger Corman fan!",1302048000,21,376,4.164383561643835

8421252,4,B004AZ7ZLI,"The one thing ""B'' movie maestro Roger Corman is renowned for is discovering and nurturing fledgling talent and these two films are no exception.  ""Jackson County Jail"" is a rather mundane effort distinguished by an explosive performance by a young Tommy Lee Jones.  ""Caged Heat"" is the better of the two films because it sports a witty script by then neophyte director Jonathan Demme.  This parody of women behind bars is so sly that if you blink you might miss the satirical edge Demme is going for.  By no means are these flicks masterpieces but for their genre they'll do.",1446854400,2,576,4.73
8421253,4,B004AZ7ZLI,"the dvd has interesting commentary on Jackson county Jail about the making of the pic. The director doesn' take the lazy way out of just rehashing the plot.  Caged Heat has Jonathan  Demme and the star and cinematographer telling about making the 180,000 pic, his first which gives a good view of what making a low budget pic is like.  Even if you don't like this sort of pic if you are interested in movies those should be of interest.  I liked both movies, remember seeing them at the time and was glad to see them again.",1434499200,3,523,4.360824742268041
8421254,3,B004AZ7ZLI,Jackson County Jail has two topless scenes. Caged Heat has multiple full frontals and topless.,1431820800,2,94,5.333333333333333
