7800311,4,1606732439,"Bought my copy from Walmart (pity the fool!). Many good episodes from the past, but not enough. And whoever compiled this collection never took the time to notice that the episode ""For Pete's Sake"" is duplicated on two of the discs (Superstars of Our Gang and The Best of Pete the Pooch). There are seven discs overall, two of the discs are two-sided, and it would have helped to include some sort of overall episode listing index printed out somewhere. In the final summation, still a good purchase that could have been assembled better, given the wealth of material available. This entire series soon to be doomed to academic studies in nostalgia, and such is indeed a loss to our culture as a whole. I'm grateful to have lived in a time to have experienced them myself.",1523404800,,772,4.642335766423358
