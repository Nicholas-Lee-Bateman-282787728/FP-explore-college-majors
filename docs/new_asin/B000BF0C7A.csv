2414954,5,B000BF0C7A,"Nathing compares to Peter Falk as Columbo. Columbo is just brilliant. I love the TV-Series. I admire Peter Falk, who ist one of the best actors of the world.. no: he ist the best! I do hope, that the complete Columbo will be available on dvd...and that the series will be continued.

2414955,5,B000BF0C7A,"Yes, I too agree with some of the reviewers here. I have purchased the first four seasons and loved them. I, too, have not and will not watch Mrs. Columbo. It's junk. I just don't understand why Universal can't include that old Mystery Movie intro. As a fan of this show, I'm starving to see that again. You can find the theme song from the opening on the Net, but you can't find the actual video of the intro. Please, Universal, include this in the Season Five Columbo collection.",1146614400,9,481,4.415730337078652
2414956,5,B000BF0C7A,"Good, another season being released. Here?s a little description and highlights of the episodes that this season inlcudes:

*Forgotten Lady.- Features Janet Leigh, the Psycho movie star. She plays the part of a retired actress that wants to make a comeback but her husband stands in her way.

*A case of immunity.- Great performance of both Hector Elizondo and Sal Mineo.

*Identity crisis.- Features Patrick McGoohan, who later became producer of some episodes of Columbo as well as acting. Leslie Nielsen plays the victim.

*A matter of honor.- Mexican flavored episode. Columbo finds himself in Mexico and gets involved with local police to solve a murder. Ricardo Montalban from ""Fantasy Isand"" is featured along with a good number of Mexican actors such as Pedro Armendariz Jr and Jorge Rivero.

*Now you see him.- One of Jack Cassidy?s last performances before his death in 1976 (in a home fire). This is a great episode, Cassidy plays the role of a magician (Santini) who has an obscure past which he doesn?t want anyone to discover.

*Last salute to the Commodore.- An unusual episode that unmasks the murder at the very end of the episode. Robert Vaughan is featured here.",1146096000,14,1181,4.969543147208122
2414957,5,B000BF0C7A,"Here's a list of the six episodes featured on this Fifth Season compilation:

1.) Episode 32: FORGOTTEN LADY. Janet Leigh stars as an aging has-been actress that murders her wealthy husband in order to finance her dream comeback on Broadway. I won't give away the ending, but it's highly unusual for a Columbo segment. Original Airdate: 9/14/1975

2.) Episode 33: A CASE OF IMMUNITY. An ambassador of the fictitious Arabic country of Suari kills the chief of security and, later, the code clerk that helped him in the murder. Columbo must not only crack the ambassador's alibis but also deal with the problem of immunity. Original Airdate: 10/12/1975

3.) Episode 34: IDENTITY CRISIS. A spy is killed on a lonely beach by his contact. Columbo discovers that the killer had been photographed beforehand hanging out with the victim at an amusement park. This segment features Patrick McGoohan and Leslie Nielsen. Original Airdate: 11/2/1975

4.) Episode 35: A MATTER OF HONOR. Ricardo Montalban plays the owner of a Mexican bull ranch who uses the bull to murder one of his workers. Columbo gets dragged into the case while vacationing in Mexico. He smells murder despite Montalban's attempts to make it look like an accident. Interesting Psychological Bit: Wait until you find out WHY Montalban felt he had to kill the man. By the way, how can you go wrong with Ricardo Montalban? Original Airdate: 2/1/1976

5.) Episode 36: NOW YOU SEE HIM. Jack Cassidy plays a magician who murders his blackmailing employer (who discovered Cassidy was a German death camp guard during WWII) while performing his ""water tank"" illusion on stage in front of dozens of witnesses. This segment is highlighted by the gorgeous Cynthia Sikes, who plays Cassidy's daughter and Magician's aide. Original Airdate: 2/29/1976

6.) Episode 37: LAST SALUTE TO THE COMMODORE. Commodor Swanson is tired of his greedy son-in-law (Robert Vaughn) turning his ship-building business into an embarrassment and decides to sell the company. The Commodore vanishes at sea that night. Columbo smells murder but his prime suspect, Vaughn, must ultimately be ruled out. This is a departure from the basic Columbo script; it turns into a classical whodunit with Columbo smoking out the murderer in a room full of potential culprits. Diane Baker guest stars as Vaughn's wife. Original Airdate 3/2/1976

I won't rate the individual segments since every Columbo episode is highly re-watchable and possesses its own unique appeal.",1145750400,16,2482,5.143920595533499
2414958,4,B000BF0C7A,"Ok, heres the deal: Universal continues to produce bare-minimum season sets regardless of cries from Columbo fans worldwide. We fans again and again are asking for the extras that make a DVD set special. Like, for example, out takes, bloopers, promos, trailers, that NBC mystery movie intro, rare appearances with Falk, interviews with Falk or Levinson or Link, anything remotely connected to the charm of the Columbo character...HOWEVER, we get nothing but no-frills packaging and as an ""extra"" some lame ""Mrs. Columbo"" episode, which doesn't even qualify as a spin-off because the character was never in the original Columbo cast. I, like many fans, own all 4 seasons issued thus far and have yet to watch any of the lame ""Mrs. Columbo"" extras. Why couldn't they have done an interview with Falk while he's still with us? Wouldn't that be incredible to hear it from Peter himself...his thoughts on certain episodes or the development of his charcter? Or perhaps the origins of Columbo, which have been stated by both Levinson & Link to be that pesky and inquisitive inspector hounding Raskalnikov in Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"".

Mrs. Columbo does not interest Columbo fans. With this mismatched formula in mind, the people at Universal might also include a live performance of Wayne Newton as an extra to their documentary on Isaac Newton.",1143763200,207,1350,5.108597285067873
2414959,4,B000BF0C7A,"The Fifth Season of Columbo consist of 6 Episodes.

Episode 32

FORGOTTEN LADY(An aging actress kills her husband because he refuses to pay for the production of her comeback show)

*Spoilerish* This was one of the most far-fetched episodes.  The wealthy husband is shown, at first, to be heartless for refusing to finance his ""famous"" wife's dream of getting back into show biz.  The reveal was, he knew she was losing her memory and ill(can't remember if she had alzheimer or another diagnosed illness).  Her husband wanted to spend time with and take care of her.  The far-fetched part was how the suspect/wife was able to commit this complex crime.  The worst part was the fact she got away with it.

Episode 33

A CASE OF IMMUNITY(A foreign ambassador steals money and murder's two people.  Columbo must solve the crime and find a way around his immunity)

Episode 34

IDENTITY CRISES(Espionage with a twist.  A spy is killed by his contact)

Episode 35

A MATTER OF HONOR(Columbo, while on vacation in Mexico, helps the policia de Mexico solve a case where the murder weapon is a bull)

Episode 36

NOW YOU SEE HIM(A master magician kills his employer who attempts to blackmail him after discovering he was a German camp guard during WWII)*FIVE STAR EPISODE*

Episode 37

LAST SALUTE TO THE COMMODORE(Commodore Swanson attempts to sell his ship building business out from under his son-in-law)*A very interesting who-done-it episode*",1142467200,132,1439,4.941422594142259

2414980,5,B000BF0C7A,"This is, in my opinion, the best series that television ever produced. Peter Falk is superb as Lt. Columbo, who plays a cat and mouse game with his murder suspects---brilliantly portrayed by famous (at the time) guest stars, whose characters change from being supremely confidant that they have committed the perfect crime to becoming increasingly uneasy as Columbo zeros in on them. The iconic final scene in each of the shows in which Columbo reveals their fatal mistake is one of the treasured moments of viewing pleasure. My favorite line in this set from Season 5 is one from ""Now You See Me"" (probably my favorite in the entire series) when Columbo looks directly into the eyes of Jack Cassidy, playing a magician who has just freed himself from locks, and says, ""I knew you could do it""---meaning two things: ""I knew you were a good enough magician to escape"" and ""I knew you could do that because I know you're the killer and now you have proved it""!!",1474848000,2,959,4.680473372781065

A couple of the episodes were pretty good, but still don't measure up to the first 3 seasons.  They also changed the Columbo character somewhat.  He acts like he's drunk or lost most of the time (more so than usual... really goofy at times).

2415036,1,B000BF0C7A,"I'm a true Cplumbo fan but there is no sign of Columbo in Season 5.  Some imposter is dressed in a rumpled coat but is completely void of Columbo's endearing personality.  I slogged through Forgotten Lady just to see Janet Leigh but the film felt laborious and like everybody was really, really working hard to complete the film so they could all go home.  I didn't---couldn't!!---make it through the other episodes.  I know Peter Falk had at times wanted to leave Columbo for other ventures and it is never more apparent than this entire series.  Read BURNED OUT!!  His personality is tired, listless and boring.  I suspected he nurtured a bad case of cynicism after so many years on the force.  While an episode from an earlier season that placed Columbo in England was charming and entertaining, the Mexican vacation was so laborious it was embarrassing.  Not only could I not make sense of the plot, but everybody was so angry and Columbo so lacking in personality that I could barely stand to watch.  The script lagged so badly and the constant Spanish with no subtitles (or heavy accents that might as well have been Spanish) so annoying, I found myself fast-forwarding through stretches of the episode.  I didn't seem to miss a thing.  I finally put the episode out of its misery and didn't finish it.  Ditto for the Mistaken Identity.  Columbo and international intrigue?!!  REALLY??  And equally absurd, Columbo taking on the CIA??  C'mon!!  No humor; no charm; no nothing.  The rumpled raincoat no longer added to his quirky charm but instead capped the impression of a tired, washed-up detective.  The scene with the belly-dancer was sooo out of character and the acting so unconvincing, Columbo almost seemed senile.  Add to that, in Forgotten Lady, the bribe to a fellow officer (""they'll never know"") to go to the firing range as Columbo's imposter because he ""couldn't hit the target"" was a dishonest side, not to mention the illegality of it all, that I really didn't need to see.  I have one more disc to suffer through.  I think the old Columbo personality returns in Season 6.  I can't resell this to anybody as my conscience would bother me; maybe I'll give it away with a fair warning of Columbo's own ""mistaken identity"" in this whole series.",1404950400,,2264,4.775773195876289

2415065,5,B000BF0C7A,"""Identity Crisis"" has all the Columbo trademarks: Guest appearances by Hollywood notables; memorable one-line throwaway gags; a baffling mystery; familiar L.A. locations; problems with the car (""there's only three like this in the country"" he says) and Columbo's tying things together by staying on that one thing that doesn't make sense.

Guest was Leslie Nielsen, looking younger and much more serious than in other roles. Can we catalog the great one-liners in these 68 movies? Here are two from this episode: Columbo: ""Do you have any wine?"" McGoohan: ""I have a whole cellar full."" Columbo (waving his hand) ""Oh, I'll just have a glass.""

Another classic: McGoohan: ""Do you like music?"" Columbo: ""Oh, I hear it all the time.""

There are only one or two shows on TV these days worth watching (NCIS and Bones). Most of the shows on TV are vulgar, violent, unfunny and promote offensive social or sexual agendas. The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion). The reality shows are unreal and stupid with most having mercenary goals. And don't even get me started on the low morals and quality of Saturday morning cartoons.

I can especially recommend Last Salute to the Commodore, which is a little bit of a different Columbo. In this one he works more closely with other detectives.

2415079,5,B000BF0C7A,"Another great collection of 6 Columbo's.

Forgotten Lady - this has become one of my favorite's after several re-watchings.  The acting is probably the best of any Columbo.  Janet Leigh really sells her performance who's grip on reality is getting foggier and Peter Falk also sells his role as the detective realizes it.  A wonderful ending as the actor in love with her gets Columbo to agree to arrest him long enough for her to be safe.  The one time that Columbo doesn't arrest the guilty party.

A Case of Immunity - great for watching Columbo stick it to the murderer at the end.

Identity Crisis - Another great performance by Patick McGoohan.  I also wonder if this is one of Leslie Nelsen's last serious roles.

A Matter of Honor - not my favorite, but one of the most sad reasons for murder you will ever see.

Now You See Him - Jack Cassidy - not the greatest actor, but a great showman.

Last Salute to the Commodore - also not my favorite, but notable for two things.  The other cops get a prominent role at the reveal, and this episode has misdirection about who did it.  Very unusual for Columbo.",1320451200,,1110,4.462686567164179

2415103,4,B000BF0C7A,"Just like the previous four seasons, I enjoyed this season 5 collection.  As other reviewers have said, the best episodes are ""Forgotten Lady"",starring Janet Leigh, ""Identity Crisis"" with guest actor and director Patrick McGoohan, and ""Now You See Him"", one of Jack Cassidy's last performances.

""Last Salute To The Commodore"" is one of my least favorite Columbo episodes, not because it strayed from the usual formula but because of the weakness of the storyline and ending.

One note for Columbo fans: In the episode ""A Matter Of Honor"" guest-starring Ricardo
Montalban, Columbo is first seen in the episode in the midst of a fender-bender. A policeman asks Columbo for identification. This is the only time in any Columbo that I've seen where you can CLEARLY see Columbo's ID...and his first name!(which I won't tell for those who would rather just think of him as Lieutenant).",1297900800,2,880,5.055172413793104
2415104,3,B000BF0C7A,"This season was a huge disappointment.  There were only a few episodes that were up to Colombo Standards.  The Forgotten Lady and Now you See Him were both excellent and met the standards that all Colombo fans come to expect and appreciate.
I would have given a 4 star to this review except for the last episode. The episode entitled The Last Commodore was an almost painful episode to watch. I'm not sure if there were different directors, writers, or what the deal was, but this one was purely awful. If you read reviews on Netflix, you will see that many thought as I did watching this that he appeared drunk, his behavior was off.  He did become divorced in 1976, possibly this is an explanation??  But, it was not like a normal Colombo show where you see all the details of the murder, think it is foolproof and watch Colombo get his man/woman with one detail the criminal forgot. This disjointed episode was confusing and the acting was annoying. The laughing of the drunken lady and others was so grating at times I almost forwent the conclusion and stopped watching.  The other episodes on the disc are ok, not fabulous, but watchable.  The two mentioned above are excellent - especially Forgotten Lady  - that one in itself is almost worth the purchase of this season.
But, of course, being a die hard Colombo fan - having ALL the seasons is a must!
The saddest of news of course is that this wonderful actor can no longer remember playing the famous, lovable, endurable Colombo!",1297641600,6,1488,4.613636363636363
2415105,4,B000BF0C7A,"First off, there is no such thing as a bad ""Columbo.""  The series, in both the 70's and latter-day interpretations, possesses some of the best acting, direction, and writing of any show in television history.  That said, there are some installments that hover far about some of the lesser-developed ones, but even the latter is still better than most fare that appears on television today.

This ""complete fifth season"" compilation has something going for it in each episode, though a few are lacking in the merits that make them noteworthy.

In this set, the best are ""Forgotten Lady,"" ""Identity Crisis,"" and ""Now You See Him.""  ""Forgotten Lady"" benefits from a rare television appearance from screen legends Janet Leigh and John Payne.  And any episode that features iconic Shakespearean actor Maurice Evans as a butler is worth its weight in film.

""Identity Crisis"" features frequent actor and director Patrick McGoohan as that murderer and it is obvious that he and star Peter Falk enjoy working together.  Their chemistry is evident in each scene they share.  The installment also features another of Falk's friends: character actor Vito Scotti who makes another of his numerous appearances in the series.

Jack Cassidy returns for the last time in the series - again as the ""villain""- in ""Now You See Him,"" this time as a murderous magician with a secret past.

The remaining three episodes while not as good as the previous three, still have a little bit going for them.

""A Matter of Honor"" takes Columbo south of the border, involved in a murder committed by guest Ricardo Montalban.

A young Hector Elizondo and 50's teen icon Sal Mineo appear in ""A Case of Immunity,"" centered around the world of international relations.

""Last Salute to the Commodore,"" though directed by McGoohan, moves too slowly but does have two murders, one that is totally unexpected.  Though two of the guest stars are Robert Vaughn and John Dehner, it is Diane Baker who takes the acting nods as both Vaughn's alcoholic wife and Dehner's daughter.  The episode also features good turns from frequent performers Wilfred Hyde-White, Bruce Kirby, and Fred Draper.

The ""bonus"" is an installment from the short-lived ""Mrs. Columbo"" with Kate Mulgrew.  Watching it proves why the show didn't last longer than thirteen episodes.",1282176000,7,2311,5.036842105263158

2415132,4,B000BF0C7A,"Peter Falk won an Emmy for his work during this season, and for good reason: some of the episodes rank among the best of the series. Unfortunately, there is some inconsistency in these episodes as well. Without question my favorite of the set is ""Identity Crisis"" starring the wonderful Patrick McGoohan. McGoohan is involved with another great dramatic actor, Leslie Nielsen (of course best known in his comic role from ""Airplane,"") in a complex web of spying and personal vendettas. McGoohan makes wonderful inside-joke references to his character from ""The Prisoner"" (""Be seeing you..."") and generally serves as one of the most effective Columbo villains (for the second time in his case.) McGoohan also directed this episode, proving his talents extend to both sides of the camera.

Interestingly, McGoohan also directed my least favorite of the shows from this set, ""Last Salute to the Commodore,"" which features an unrealistic and implausible plot with an exceptionally drawn-out inquisition scene. The best part about this episode was watching Robert Vaughan be taunted by not only Columbo but his drunken wife. The problems with this episode range from the two other cops that ""help"" Columbo investigate the case, to competing alternate theories about who the murderer could plausibly be that make more sense than the version finally accepted. I actually had reservations at the very beginning of the episode when the actual murder wasn't shown, as is customary on Columbo. Sometimes hunches prove correct.

Another strong episode is ""Now You See Him"" featuring a magician with a past worth concealing. I found it amusing that the magician's name was ""The Great Santini,"" later the name of a great Pat Conroy novel, and fabulous film starring Robert Duvall. I am supposing that Conroy must be a ""Columbo"" fan, too. I enjoyed ""A Matter of Honor"" with special guest-villain Ricardo Montalban as a bullfighter. In this lesson Columbo learns many important lessons about life south of the border, including why it's unwise to drive in Mexico. ""Forgotten Lady"" stars Janet Leigh, and while interesting is not one of my favorite episodes for two reasons: one, Leigh's performance is somewhat wooden, especially during her ""forgetful"" moments; and two, the premise is so implausible as to be unbelievable, even by ""Columbo"" standards.

Peter Falk is consistently brilliant in this set, and I do recommend it.

Of course, the Jack Casidy one is the best, followed by that Pyscho girl's appearance as a has been movie star. The ship one is good, followed by A CASE OF IMMUNITY, and the bullfighter. The spy episode in not up to par. I quess this is the end of me buying Columbo, since I have recorded and played to death all the remaining installments.

Patrick McGoohan, who gained fame with his portrayal of Spies and what happens to spies when they retire, gets to hint at his Prisoner role a bit in a great issue of Columbo from this particular year. Identity Crisis is what the audience experiences, as little hints are constantly betraying the murderer and his identity as the prisoner. McGoohan says more than once ""Be seeing you"". This of course, was the departing custom by Number 6. He is also well acquainted with Japanese and the east and it is perhaps one of the better Columbo episodes. As fans know McGoohan appeared twice during the run of this series and as a bit of trivia, only 2 actors appeared 3 times as Columbo criminals. Robert Culp and Jack Cassidy. (Cassidys on this season too!)  In reviewing the rest, the scenarios are always the same.

The episodes are Forgotten Lady with Janet Leigh, A Case of Identify with Hector Elizondo, Identity Crisis with Patrick McGoohan, A Matter of Honor with Ricardo Montalban, Now You See Him with Jack Cassidy, and Last Salute to the Commodore with Robert Vaughn.

2415146,4,B000BF0C7A,"This season had some gems some of my least favorite episodes. Here's a rundown of my impressions:

Forgotten Lady: The performances in this episode seem flat, despite a star-studded guest star cast. Janet Leigh's character grows increasingly unsympathetic. The only episode I can remember in which Columbo lets the character off the hook.

A Case of Immunity: A decent turn by Hector Elizondo, but frankly bad acting by poor Sal Mineo. The young king is the nicest surprise here.

Identity Crisis: Leslie Nielsen would have made a great Columbo murderer. Sadly, he's the victim here and therefore not on screen much. The electricity the always sparks between Patrick McGoohan and Falk is delightful here. Scenes in LA's Travel Town add a nice touch of local color.

A Matter of Honor: Ricardo Montalban's performance here is frankly boring. The relationship between Columbo and his host police capitan is the most fun in this episode.

Now You See Him: This is one of my all-time favorite episodes. Jack Cassidy is at his most malevolent and believable as Santini, the magician and ex-Nazi guard Stephan Mueller. Columbo's scenes with Sgt. ??? (can't remember his name, but we saw him in Greenhouse Jungle as well) are hilarious.

Last Salute to the Commodore: The only episode in which we are unsure of the murderer until the end. Robert Vaughn is excellent in this. The running gag of Columbo crowding in on him is one of the funniest bits of comic relief in the whole series.

All in all, this season is worth purchasing, but who am I kidding. I'll purchase them all :)",1162684800,2,1572,4.843283582089552
2415147,3,B000BF0C7A,"Season five is my least favorite season. I felt that the scripts were not as clever and entertaining as the previous seasons. My favorite episode in this set was, ""Now, you see him"" with Jack Cassidy playing the Great Santini who murders his blackmailing boss. I had planned not to buy this set, but at 19.99, I couldn't pass it up. So, I purchased it to complete my Columbo collection. I have ordered Season Six. It has some of my favorite episodes on it.

2415148,2,B000BF0C7A,"This set was a gift.  I was amazed at how cheaply this series is now being produced. No artwork on the DVD, no artwork on the inside of the cases.  The worst of all is the fact that Universal markets these sets as ""complete & uncut"".  They are not uncut. ""Last Salute to the Commodore"" is missing more than 10 minutes of footage.  In the 1970s, commercial breaks did not run 25 minutes for a 2 hour program. That is common now, but not in the 70s. ""Commodore"" runs just over 95 minutes. In a 2 hour slot, that leaves 25 minutes for commercials. As I said, not in the 70s.  The show is very jumpy because of the cuts. Each of these episodes is heavily cut up. If you don't mind chopped up episodes, and cheaply done packaging, this set is for you. Otherwise, look at the alternate sets being offered online by other providers.

2415151,5,B000BF0C7A,"Watching 'Columbo' at its inception when I was a pre-teenager impressed me.  Since acquiring the seasons on DVD, I appreciate them even more.  They have stood up to the test of time.  As an adult, I can't help but notice that as the episodes go by, the quality of the show rises incrementally over time.  So far this is the best season.

Season five again has fine guest murderers.  What really improves is the writing.  There are more details and aspects for every case, so we can really scratch our heads along with Columbo and enjoy the cases' resolutions with greater appreciation.  The earlier seasons were more linear, and the results often seemed pulled out of a hat.  The coincidences are more reasonable as time advances; petty complaints of contrivances fade away; and the viewer can be more enthralled by the adventure as well as the likable, feigned, bumbling of a smart detective who knows how to throw the key suspects off guard.

The performances are particularly strong for television.  Of course, accolades for Peter Falk almost seem gratuitous, but the guests really shine also.  Janet Leigh ('Psycho') shows a suspect's natural nervousness like few are able.  Ricardo Montalban is supremely arrogant as an aging bullfighter, and Robert Vaughn is quietly arrogant in a way that only he perfected.  Jack Cassidy is slick in a sleight-of-hand performance as the murdering magician in ""Now You See Him"".  (No performance seems over the top, either.)  The variety again is admirable.  We get murders at an Arab Embassy, across the border in Mexico, at a magician's nightclub, and an advertising agency.  The suspects sometimes have secrets or secret identities that work well into some adventures.

Season five is also distinctive for diverging from the formula.  ""A Case of Immunity"" and ""Last Salute to Commodore"" work in this vein.  The latter particularly has admirable twists and turns that are found in no other episode.  Patrick McGoohan (who stars in ""Identity Crisis"" and was perhaps the best guest actor last season as the murderer who was director of a military academy) directed this season finale.  Combined with the editing, it is slick and accomplished.  However, the departures aren't all worthwhile.  Sometimes the episode gets a little too cute for its own good.  New and classic elements make season five particularly excellent.

There are only six episodes this time around.  (Seven if you count 'Mrs. Columbo'.  Many customers  complain that this series, which also has one episode last season, is 'Columbo' in name only.  This is a bit unfair.  The only strong connection last season would be with the Basset hound both series shared.  While 'Columbo' is far better, the character in 'Mrs. Columbo' is warm and likable.  This episode shows her having some of the detective traits her husband has--even though last season's collection didn't show much similarlity.  The music sometimes makes this adventure suspenseful in a way that 'Columbo' seldom is.  Last season's 'Mrs. Columbo' put together a case like 'Magic' in a creepy way that the movie with Anthony Hopkins failed to do.  This time ""Caviar with Everything"" is worth a try.)",1156032000,5,3170,5.038535645472062

By rights, Universal should have packaged this together with Season 6 or offered it at a reduced price, but that studio continues to take advantage of the fans by gouging us, giving us ""Mrs. Columbo"" instead of decent extras, and showing a lack of respect and knowledge of the show itself by making blunders like listing Robert Loggia rather than Jack Cassidy as the star of ""Now You See Him""!",1154390400,6,683,4.60655737704918

Columbo was one of the few shows, where the story quality rarely degenerated from one season to the next. That said, however, it's nothing short of criminal that several of these episodes are NOT in their original full length. From the first season DVD set, actress Barbara Rhodes is missing from ""A Lady In Waiting"". Even worse, a key scene in a recording studio with Columbo and an engineer is missing from the famous ""Swan Song"" episode with Johnny Cash, from the second or third season. And I've found large scene deletions in at least two other favorite episodes on other season DVDs. These shameful practices are characteristic of most American conglomerates like GE-NBC-Universal that consistently show that their regard for their customers is even lower than that of their own substandard merchandise.

It takes a second viewing to realize the whole show is done as a comedy -- with all kinds of clues that Falk and Vaughn and the cast are staging an episode-long put-on.  I salute Falk and director McGoohan, who had the guts (it must have been Falk's idea, he had all the power by the fifth season) to hilariously do a two-hour takeoff of the Colombo series and the title character.  Come on, loosen up critics -- Falk playing with Vaughn's arm and ear while they exchange dialogue; practically sitting on his lap in the car; the Inspector tangling Vaughn in a phone cord then having him try to hang it up in a jumble; Falk hilariously trying to scream over the drilling in the boatyard in a scene in which everybody starts to crack up before somebody yelled 'cut.' The Inspector crawling all over the boat and bizarrely repeating every technical explanation about sailing that he hears (and nearly falling in the water). Colombo supposedly whistling beautifully, like a bird, at the close just before the credits, even though he has a lit cigar firmly planted in his mouth.  Falk talking directly into the hair of the TM girl as she meditates. And driving his car in unnecessary repetitive circles and speeding short distances like a madman. The whole show is intended as a joke, a put-on of -- and for --the audience, the way Saturday Night Live or Python might have portrayed the series.  Hard to believe that the bitter critics of this episode don't get the self-parody.  The actors can hardly keep straight faces. To rate and review this one as a serious whodunit is to completely miss the very clever point.  Kudos to Falk and whomever else had the guts to purposefully sink an episode for sly laughs.  And watch Falk's eyes and the manners of most of the actors--there was either a lot of drinking going on during lunch, or somebody showed up on the set each day with some illegal smokes.  It's a full-out joke, and a very gutsy and funny one, making it the best Colombo episode ever.  I've been waiting for its release. ""Last Salute's"" inclusion on this box set alone would merit a Five-Star ranking here, but the inexcusable and astonishing editing blunders -- the black dropouts and sloppy cuts are shocking -- drop it to Four and almost merit a money-back demand by consumers.  In that regard, the set is a rip-off and the producers should pay.  But life being what it is, that ain't gonna happen. So I'll gladly accept Season Five and the wonderful inclusion of the magical and hilarious in-joke ""Last Salute to the Commodore,"" THE greatest Colombo episode of all-time.

The stories are trite and the acting is below par. Actors that performed very well in previous seasons episodes (Jack Cassidy, Robert Vaughn) seem to have become bored and unimpressed in this set. Even the maestro, Peter Falk, is below par. He has become bumbling and boring in most of these episodes. Also, it seems as though the stories were based on 30 minutes worth of ideas stretched out to 90 minutes. What happened? How could such a clever show change so dramatically? I felt season four was great. Maybe everyone was tired of doing it by season five. If this is what I have to look forward to in season six i won't be buying it.",1153008000,5,801,4.608391608391608

I know true COLUMBO fans will probably buy it no matter how awful (and it IS awful!), but get ready to be disappointed. The tip-off should be the unnatural, uncharacteristically toothy grin someone talked Mr. Falk into wearing on the cover. The ONLY episode that comes close to maintaining the essence of the character and the series is A CASE OF IMMUNITY, helped along by Hector Elizondo. FORGOTTEN LADY comes off as a self-indulgent homage by Hollywood to Hollywood, in which an aging starlet (living in a typical celebrity fantasy world) does the crime and then avoids the time because a brain condition sends her into another fantasy world which is to be of short duration. I felt that Peter Falk betrayed his character in letting the murderer off the way he did. The only thing that stands out in NOW YOU SEE HIM, is the lame ""boom-chick"" drum interlude played throughout Jack Cassidy's tedious magic performance (twice!). LAST SALUTE TO THE COMMODORE sunk with all hands. It was a truly abominable episode - one moment a bad acid trip, then a 3 Stooges short, finally a high school who-done-it. It was painful and embarassing to watch Mr. Falk act in this one. I suspect the fault lies with this season's directors, but especially with Patrick McGoohan who directed COMMODORE, and the goofy, IDENTITY CRISIS.

Oh, as for the extras, don't forget, the 7th or 8th season had only a few episodes each  so either UNIVERASAL will combine 7& 8 or produce a documentary encapsulating the series as a whole, including some of the things we'd love to see. If not, a web site should be posted with ""alternative"" ways of obtaining this materail since it's out there& there is most certainly a huge demand. I will continue to search for the answers. Try peterfalk.com- he seems to like Columbo also.",1149638400,8,1530,4.8396946564885495

I want you to stop editing the Columbos. I watched Troubled Waters on DVD and there is a whole scene edited out! I know it's missing because I remember it on TV. The scene is the one where the magician explains to the police that a real gun has been subsituted with his fake gun for his performance. THe way it has been cut leaves the viewer confused as to why the magician scene is in there in the first place! I love Columbo as is. We're paying tons of money for these old pictures that would be sitting around earning no money so please give us what we want. SO QUIT EDITING will you!!! We're paying for this and I thought CDs hoave so much room, why edit? Also lose the Mrs. Columbo, that'll give you more room so you won't have to edit! I will of course purchase season 5 but if anyone ever comes out with a totally unedited version of all, I will probably purchase those!",1148947200,78,894,4.1976744186046515
2415170,4,B000BF0C7A,"Dear Universal,

I know, being the intelligent people that you are, you can read the comments here and elsewhere about the total lack of extras that have appeared in these Columbo sets up to now (repeat after me...""Mrs. Columbo"" is not an extra), and if you haven't figured it out yet, you're really starting to irritate us fans.  Now I know like all large impersonal corporations you really don't care about the bottom-line (cough) and only want to see your customer base happy and content.  Therefore I would like to point out to you that Season 6 has only 3 episodes - half the number of Seasons 4 & 5, and that means 3 fewer episdoes you have to pay to clean-up and restore!  Now wouldn't it be nice to fill up all that empty space on those disks with the extras we really want to see - interviews, outtakes, the original NBC Mystery Movie opening (hey, you and NBC are family now since Vivendi owns you both)...I'll even let you throw in a ""Mrs. Columbo"" episode if you provide the other items!  Think how happy your customers will be.  Think how happy you will be when you can get away with charging the same price for 1/2 the normal number of episodes.  It sounds to me like a win-win for both of us!",1148169600,37,1207,4.361607142857143
2415171,5,B000BF0C7A,"I look forward to this new set as the Coluumbo character becomes slightly more complex and familiar. I actually enjoyed the Mrs Columbo episodes. She is a clever detective in her own way,as well as a persistant pest to the guilty party. I encourage people to give her a try.",1147305600,6,274,4.5
