Now that I have my DVD I can watch it over and over - which is what this production and performance deserves.  Just excellent in every way.  I think Royal Opera is often superior to the Met these days and if Kaufmann is in an opera, it usually is amazing - Angela and the rest of the cast is wonderful.  I also agree with other viewers comments about the Caballe version which I also have, but the quality of the video can't begin to match this one which is just superb.",1332720000,18,724,4.318518518518519
5064276,5,B0079IJ17E,"Adriana Lecouvreur is absolutely superb, Angela Gheorghiu's portrayal of Adriana is brilliant her voice is magnificent and her acting is brilliant too, her soprano is always spot on for any role whether it be Cilea, Donizetti or Puccini, it goes without saying that she is lovely to look at, her acting is absolutely true to any role that she appears in. Jonas Kaufman's tenor is tremendous, it is well controlled and emotionally inspiring, he is a tenor of great talent one of those unique tenors who can sing Wagner with immense power and with the acting voice that Wagner demands, then he can sing Cilea, Puccini or Verdi with the feeling and vocal change required for their roles. Angela Gheorghiu and Jonas Kaufman are perfectly matched in any role they aspire to.",1391990400,2,769,4.833333333333333
5064277,5,B0079IJ17E,"A LOT OF VOICE(S) for a little opera.  Worth it tho'.  The production was excellent, and the appearance or a rarity is always welcome to the serious collector",1390953600,,158,4.607142857142857
5064278,5,B0079IJ17E,"Adrana is one of my favorite operas! The music and melodies are wonderful! Angela Gheorghiou's temperament fits the role. Her striking natural beauty and radiance bring the character to life! Her acting is good and her voice is good from a technical and quality viewpoint. Although her voice is a bit small for the role, she is successfull in her interpretation. Jonas Kaufmann is terrific as Maurizio! Mr. Kaufmann is one of the greatest voices of our time and he is that rarest of tenors-a dramatic spinto! The supporting cast is good and the production and Blu-Ray quality are fantastic!",1384992000,,590,4.91
5064279,4,B0079IJ17E,"This opera has several well-written and perfectly sung arias. Its unfortunate that it only gets to be performed rarely.

 I could find no fault, with any of the singing. The costuming and staging are appropriate, for the period in which the opera was intended. This is a traditional production. These aspects were perfect.

 The only reason I didn't provide 5 stars, which the singing more than deserves, is that, in the early part of Act 1, we are treated to views of the Prince and Abb sexually groping their mistress/actresses, while in their mistresses dressing rooms. Maurizio attempts the same, quickly, with Adriana, just a bit later. None of this is required of the opera and none of it has any valid place.

 The sexual groping makes the opera not one which can be shown to children, which is a shame.",1384732800,,810,4.709219858156028
5064280,5,B0079IJ17E,"What a pleasant surprise this production is.  Not many recordings of this opera are available, but this one brings ""Adriana Lecouvreur"" back into repertory in London's opera history.  Beautiful production, with innovative sets and beautiful costumes, and singing that fills the house.  The 'Music' by Celia matches anything Puccini ever wrote.  Orchestrations and the orchestra's playing is beautiful, lush, melodic, and warming for the tragedy as it unfolds.  E N J O Y !",1383004800,,472,5.324324324324325
5064281,5,B0079IJ17E,"Loved the staging, the back stage atmosphere in the first act with all the hustle and bustle, very imaginative! All the singers and actors were superb, down to the smallest parts. This was Angela Georghiu's opera. I thought she was perfect for the part, her singing and acting flawless. I especially liked her dramatic and passionate recitation for the Princess of Bouillon. The character of Maurizio was not quite clear to me. He seemed to be a little bit of this and a little bit of that. I'll be watching this opera many more times and would recommend it.",1382659200,,558,4.646464646464646
5064282,4,B0079IJ17E,"This unfamiliar opera was a surprise. It has some qualities of a musical, some of an opera. Cast is superb. Gheorghiu is wonderful as an actress with great talent and no pretentions.  Kaufmann sings gloriously as always and reveals his depths  as an actor, playing a man in his true and false selves with equal conviction. The end of this opera would place it, I believe, in a category loosely called tragi-comedy. If a book is a good read, Adriana Lecouvreur is a good watch-listen.",1380672000,,483,4.670588235294118
5064283,5,B0079IJ17E,"I love the music of this opera and, fortunately, this DVD had the best voices with English subtitles.  The English subtitles enable me to know what is being sung - what they are saying to each other.  And this is important to me.",1376006400,,229,4.3023255813953485
5064284,5,B0079IJ17E,"I was at the Old Metropolitan Opera when Renata Tebaldi and Franco Corelli recreated Adriana for Mr. Bing. It was fabulous, the only thing i didn't like about this Adriana was the the entry of Adriana just before the ballet, there should have been a large staircase where she was introduced to the attendees  instead she had to enter and leave through the stage that was there. The performances were perfect the staging in that act was bad.",1371600000,,440,4.641025641025641
5064285,5,B0079IJ17E,"I was pleasantly surprised by this production of the London Royal Opera House. Not that I had any comparisons - I never saw it live and I only vaguely remember another ""Adriana Lecouvreur"" televised many years ago which at that time did not compel me to rush out and get a recording.

The action takes place in Paris around 1730 and the sets, costumes, wigs, and furnishings transmit a realistic picture of this era.  The composer, Francesco Cilea, was a contemporary of Puccini, Mascagni, Leoncavallo and several others who composed in the verismo style and of all his works Adriana is his most successful composition  (although it seems to be neglected if one looks at opera schedules of the world's leading opera houses). The music has charm, is romantic, sentimental and easy to listen to.

Angela Gheorghiu in the title role is superb. It takes a diva to convincingly  depict a diva and Gheorghiu is tailor fit for Adriana.  She has charisma, is glamorous, passionate, sentimental and her singing perfectly expresses all these varied emotions.  Adriana's love interest Maurizio, sung by German tenor Jonas Kaufmann, does not disappoint either. His is a somewhat ambiguous role - Maurizio, count of Saxony, seems to be genuinely in love with Adriana, but at the same time he also engages in a relationship with the Princess de Bouillon (sung and acted very well by Olga Borodina) in order to further his political ambitions. Kaufmann has it all - the voice, the looks, the charm. Alessandro Corbelli, as Michonnet, the Comedie Francaise's stage manager, is sweetly sentimental and deeply touching in his love and adoration for Adriana. While Adriana, Maurizio and the Princess are bigger than life - each of them vehemently pursuing their own interests - he quietly suffers from his unrequited love for Adrina and with his humanity and humility gives a certain balance to the ensemble.

Part of the action takes place on the stage of the Comedie Francaise where Adriana works as an actress - so we  have a stage within a stage action.  Accordingly, since French audiences of that era always insisted  on at least one ballet scene within an opera, there is a whimsical ballet ""The Judgment of Paris "" included in act 3.

The DVD concludes with a bonus feature ""All about Adriana"" which contains interviews with the two principal singers Angela Gheorghiu and Jonas Kaufmann, as well as the stage director David McVicar, the set designer Charles Edwards and conductor Marc Elder of the Royal Opera House London. All of them are very enthusiastic about their work in the production of this opera which had not been seen on the ROH stage for over 100 years.  In my opinion this is a very successful staging of an almost forgotten opera.",1362009600,4,2735,4.881209503239741
5064291,5,B0079IJ17E,"Surely, this is one of the most eye pleasing period production to come along in the recent decade.  Kudos to the 'diva' Ms. Gheorghiu for suggesting to ROH this production of this rather infrequently performed masterpiece.
Apparently the plot of Adriana Lecouvreur is complicated and too schemy for most 'men' - it is basically 'women' stuff concerning love, jealousy and intrigue.
Even so, the story is arresting for its roller-coaster emotional surges - the Act 1 re-union of the lovers to be tightly followed by the farewell-bidding to an old love; followed by the 'encounter' between the old and new loves; culmulating in a dramatic open clash between the two loves, eventually leading to the death of the real love out of vengeance by the old.
Just this short excerpted account would tell you that this is a 'women' opera, dominated by two rivalling and unyielding dames fatale.
Angela Gheorghiu virtually owns the role of Adriana - she does not have to be a big-hearted woman.  This woman is jealous, suspicious, yet she is also tempestuous and genuine.  Apart from one or two minor hiccups, Gheorghiu is generally fine vocally in this role, and her acting is credulous.  The sets and costumes really complements her role well, and every time she appears, her Adriana is the centre of attention on stage.  This is very important for this 'diva' role - for a soprano of lessor charisma and stage presence, the conviction could simply be lost.
As her arch-rival, Olga Borodina is appropriately less glamorous, but her big-toned and expressive singing enables Borodina to create a role of huge self-ego and dominating noble personna, who would not be able to admit defeat in the hands of a mere diva.
Seldom could a tenor bring home the role of Maurizio, the Count of Saxony as does Jonas Kaufmann.  He not only owns the role vocally, but he is also able to convince the audience that this Count is 'the' person that women fought for to their deaths - he has the looks, the charisma, the manliness, the ardour, and the most important aspect of all, his Maurizio is a hero.  A lessor tenor would have the audience missed the short but important account of Maurizio's warfare with the Cossacks.  It is but a fleeting account, almost like a recitative.  However, the tenor needs to carry this heroic aspect throughout the entire opera to bring home to the audience what a figure this Count of Saxony is - that he is very much a man of the world as well as a man of real attachment.  This aspect is important to account for his falling for, then falling out with, the Princess Boullion.
Apart from the three major leads, there is a fourth character that is most worthy of mention - the theatre manager Michonnet portrayed by Alexandro Corbelli.
Again, Michonnet is an important figure, since it is he that harks back to Adriana and the audience the unsurmountable social gap between nobility and mere actors/actresses.
That the heroic deeds of Adriana in defying nobility and class distinction that led to her demise lends much pathos and dimension to this titlerole character and the entire work.  Corbelli carries this role perfectly, vocally as well as dramatically.",1361836800,6,3168,4.815837937384899
5064292,4,B0079IJ17E,"This opera has a confusing, complicated plot, the most affected and exaggerated dialog you can imagine and a wonderful, yes, wonderful, sublime music, from beginning to end.

It is hard to imagine a tougher role than Adriana Lecouvreur for a soprano. She must display an attractive beauty, she must sing with angelical sweetness, tragic determination and thundering rage, and besides all this, she must declaim in full voice the Racine's Phedre speech, in Italian. Existing audio recordings by Olivero, Tebaldi, Scotto and Freni show their different approaches to the many demands of the role, with different results of course. I don't know a Callas version, but if she ever did it on stage that could be a reference. Angela Gheorghiu is a well known, first rated soprano for the last 20 years, and she can cope with almost all the requirements. She is very attractive, she sings really sweet and she delivers an overall well balanced performance, although she lacks the deep fire of true rage. Her recitative of ""Il monologo di Fedra"" is not enough compelling.

Her ""rivale"", Olga Borodina, is the absolute opposite. Although she's no match to the more glamorous Adriana, she looks powerful, dangerous, revengeful, mean. Her mezzo-soprano is ample, resounding, of the Slavonic kind if I may say, and she does a very good Princesse de Bouillon.

Jonas Kaufmann is, well, the tenor of the times. Splendid dark voice (like Del Monaco, Martinucci or Ermanno Mauro), highly dramatic presence on stage, and a handsome guy, too. He delivers an excellent Maurizio, all the way round.

Alessandro Corbelli is a very good choice for Michonnet: his comic actor background and still respectable baritone voice make a perfect match for the role. All other roles are well done by good and experienced singers, and the overall performance shows no low marks. Stage Director McVicar presents us a tasty, sexy, fine glance at the Comdie-Franaise in 1730, which in these ""modernization"" times deserves my grateful applause.

The wonderful music of Francesco Cilea is well served by singers and orchestra, audio and video recordings are quite good. DVD includes subtitles en English, French, German, Spanish (so-so), but NOT Italian!!!. Also there's a 23 minutes bonus (""All about Adriana""), with interviews on main artists and directors. I think this a recommendable DVD.",1358726400,4,2354,5.151832460732984
5064293,5,B0079IJ17E,"Magnificent - the stellar partnership of Gheorghiu and Kaufmann (as in Tosca) brings early 20th century verismo into pulsating energy and passion.  Elegant, opulent staging by David McVicar - no gimmicks! - and superb conducting by Mark Elder make this a must.

A discovery - for those who may not be familiar with the work of this great artist - is Alessandro Corbelli's Michonnet - simply perfect.  Olga Borodina is of course the greatest Principessa di Bouillion who ever lived and breathed and sang. Great!  All comprimari are up to the task.  A wonderful performance.",1354060800,,572,4.978947368421053
5064294,5,B0079IJ17E,"I never liked Cilea that much, but I watched this dvd for Kaufmann and Gheorghiu. Kaufmann has a gorgeous voice and is a very handsome man, but dramatically I found him wanting. Gheorghiu was very wise to turn to verismo roles, like Floria Tosca and Adriana Lecouvreur: she has the ideal tessitura for these roles. I find it incredible that at 46 her voice is so full, rich in harmonics, and even throughout the range. I am equally seduced by her top notes and her low notes: she is in top vocal form! Dramatically, she puts a very convincing performance. I do not know of any other contemporary soprano who could rival her as Adriana. I hope she will return to perform at the MET - it is a shame that this opera house employs so many mediocrities instead of bringing the best.
This dvd is a must buy.",1351900800,3,801,4.382550335570469
5064295,3,B0079IJ17E,"The performance is first rate. However the 'lighting' of the production is poor,and reqires adjustment of the TV to lighten the picture in parts.",1346284800,,145,5.083333333333333
5064296,5,B0079IJ17E,"This opera was put on at the ROH in 2010 after an absence of some 100 years and as a direct response to a request by Angela Gheorghiu with a view to her singing the title role. She has been surrounded with a cast of impeccable calibre, a director of vision, a sensitive conductor and supported by an orchestra which has never played better than at present.

David McVicar's new production is totally in period and can be reasonably described as essentially 'traditional.' It is typically lavish in its detail and, importantly, is able to clarify the complexities of the evolving plot as the overlapping layers of the stage world and the `real' world increasingly mingle in Adriana's mind.

The choice of cast in this opera is especially crucial in several respects. The singers must clearly be able to sing well of course, but in an opera set in an acting environment, they must also be able to act particularly well. On top of this, with themes of love, jealousy and revenge, these passionate relationships must be believable and, for me, this requires believable age ranges in the casting. In all of these respects this production is faultless.

Gheorghiu, in a title role that she particularly identifies with, produces one of her finest performances both as a singer and as a multi-layered actress. In these respects she is ideally partnered with Jonas Kaufmann who is an outstanding actor/singer on the world stage today. Alessandro Corbelli stands out as the disappointed lover/admirer giving 100% support for Adriana throughout. Olga Borodina as the jealous Princess is as mercilessly domineering as required. All the other supporting roles are of equal calibre.

There is a particularly revealing 23 minute bonus in the form of interweaving interview extracts given by director David McVicar, set designer Charles Edwards, conductor Mark Elder and the two lead singers, Angela Gheorghiu and Jonas Kaufmann during which all offer detailed comments about the opera generally and this production in particular.

In terms of recording quality the camera work is superb and involving and provides the great clarity of imaging typical of HD. The sound is simply wonderful and fully up to the standards that one would expect from a recording company with the pedigree of Decca. It is presented in DTS-HD as well as stereo.

I would suggest that this is an outstanding modern production and performance of a fine and often under-rated opera. It deserves to be seen as a benchmark modern recording to be considered in that light and separate to older recordings. Those may bring various other virtues such as particular alternative production values or interpretive insights but they cannot compete in terms of a modern HD recording experience as presented on this disc. This disc therefore brings together an impressive number of plus points which should give considerable satisfaction to all but those in favour of more established but older recordings.

I summary therefore, I would suggest that, when specifically judged on its own terms as above, it deserves to be considered very seriously along with other more vintage performances of repute. It also has the considerable advantages of fine visuals and sonics of a modern recording as previously mentioned which should give enormous additional pleasure to most future purchasers.",1341619200,,3335,5.119485294117647
5064297,5,B0079IJ17E,"Just loved the entire production of Andriana Lecouvreur even though it is considered a French comedy with a trafic ending.  There is nothing like blue-ray.  The color is phenomenal, and the singing by Gheorghiu and Kaufmann was absolutely beautiful.

5064298,5,B0079IJ17E,"This opera does not have a story that easily translates as truth to today's audience. And, I believe in less capable hands it could be a disaster and even prompt chuckles from the audience as the opera ends. This production does none of that. It consists of first rate staging, acting, and especially singing. Though the tenor character is not a very sympathetic character in the story, you do believe he actually is really in love at the end just as his love dies from poison flowers. Jonas Kaufmann is the best male singing actor of our time and to make this opera work that level of skill what is necessary. I found myself so taken by the beauty of the music both from Angela Gheorghiu and Jonas Kaufmann that I was lost in the moment over and over througout. And there could not be a better vocal fit than Olga Borodina for the character of the princess. The story didn't matter to me at all as the music, terrific staging and great acting and singing transported me to a place I love opera to take me. Do yourself a favor and see this production. It's not likely to be staged any better in our generation.",1336176000,19,1110,4.393203883495145
5064299,4,B0079IJ17E,"The performing history of Adriana Lecouvreur outside of Italy is at best checkered. Essentially it has been the wish of the Prima Donna to mount it although its premiere in 1907 at the Metropolitan was doubtless the desire of Gatti-Casazza. the General Manager. Caruso repeated the role of Maurizio which he had sung in Italy and London. The title role was sung by Lina Cavaliere, a great beauty but unable to create public interest in the opera even though it was performed during the following season. It was not until Tebaldi coaxed Bing to mount it for her that the work reentered the repertoire. Prior to this Ponselle in the mid thirties asked the then General Manager, Edward Johnson, to revive it for her. Ponselle's top voice had become somewhat precarious and many of her scores had to be lowered; Adriana with its high note a B was ideal for the great singer, but Johnson refused and Ponselle retired.

Bing, not known for flexibility in dealing with singers, doubtless felt that the work with Tebaldi would be a success, but unfortunately Tebaldi's mother died and the great soprano returned to Italy. The opera was farmed out to a variety of singers, not all of whom found the music vocally congenial. San Francisco mounted it for Scotto in the seventies (a live recording exists) and Sony recorded it with the diva, Domingo and Milnes. Certainly Scotto's performance is a touchstone and it is a pity that cameras were not present to document the event.

In approaching this opera one must simply accept the work for what it is. Cilea was born in the middle of the nineteenth century and that is where the music is. Unlike Puccini who was a  far more gifted and sophisticated composer, Cilea simply wasn't interested in music that had a whiff of the new trends in composition. And while he had a great success at the premiere of Adriana its continued success even in Italy has to a certain extent has been the desire of the soprano to have it mounted for her. This was the case at ROH. Gheorghiu appears to have a good relationship with the powers that be in England; it was her desire to sing Adriana and she wanted the director, David McVicar. What the lady wants..............

The powers that be were very wise when they cast Jonas Kaufmann as Maurizio. A tenor who looks good, who can act and one that can bring nuance and subtlety to the music is always going to be a plus in any performance. When he is not singing with Adriana the role of Maurizio is somewhat of an empty suit, dramatically. Cossotto or Simionato would have been the choice in the fifties and sixties for Princesse de Boullion but Borodina retains considerable power and skill for the role delivering what is required of her. Ideally the lead role is best sung by a spinto or at least a soprano who can pretend to that ideal. Gheorghiu's middle and low notes are not her glory but when the vocal line goes above the stave she is wonderful and she has retained her physical beauty and as an actress she fulfills all the  requirements needed. A vocally poor performance--even a mediocre one--is not worth documenting. Boheme has suffered through dozens of indifferent performances in provincial theatres and it has hurt its reputation not a whit; it is that well constructed. Adriana is not that sturdy and ROH have provided us with a document that while not perfect, need not fear any competition. What I do fear is that when the work is revived, the company will not lavish the same attention and thereby condemming it to another hundred years of silence.

The set contains a ""bonus"": twenty six minutes of interviews with the diva, Kaufmann, McVicar and Sir Mark, Elder, the conductor. All do their best to convince you that the opera is a viable and worthy work. That the opera is flawed dramatically is hardly a stumbling block to popularity. Cilea provided a wealth of tunes which are repeated ad infinitum. What is lacking is that the composer was unable to make us care ultimately about the heroine, her vulnerability as well as her strengths. I admit that while I want to enjoy the opera I have never been able to give myself over to it as have the other reviewers. Cilea is a sitting duck for most critics who have savaged the work whenever it is revived. Fortunately for the opera most patrons have not read the critics and if they had it wouldn't be of any consequence. If it takes another hundred years for ROH to revive the work, Adriana will surely be reborn again for the soprano who is dying to sing the role.",1335139200,38,4512,4.626716604244694
5064300,5,B0079IJ17E,"Lets put aside the obvious. This is a wonderful recording, both in terms of picture and sound (the blu-ray specially glorious). McVicar's production is generally very good, with rich costumes; sort of traditional, but that's a good thing. Mark Elder treats with respect the score and has a great orchestra at his disposal. I don't think this opera has ever sounded better than here. The cast boasts star singers at their peak. Angela Gheorghiu is in excellent voice and Jonas Kaufmann sounds (and looks) magnificent. Olga Borodina and Alessandro Corbelli are very good too. I couldn't bring myself to giving it less than five stars. So here we have a truly great performance, wonderfully recorded, that can be recommended without reservations, right? Well... Not quite.

Adriana Lecouvreur has been sung by many divas (in some cases at the end of their careers). Somehow it must appeal to their oversized egos. It's a role that requires contrasting vocal resources, from very dramatic ousburts to moments of great delicacy and finesse. But also an oustanding personality that must fills the stage, a sort of radiance, in a word ""grandeur"". Gheorghiu doesn't lack ego, particularlly outside the stage. There are many stories going around, but you only need to listen to her in the interesting bonus ""About Adriana"" included in this release to realize that. She asked Covent Garden to stage the opera for her, after more of a century ignoring it, and she beleives to be part of a historical event. She also says SHE REALLY WAS Adriana on stage two days before. But to my eyes (and this is of course a subjective perception)she does not have that presence the role ideally asks for. She is coquettish, she is agitated (too agitated even) at almost all times, she acts girlish and she demands attention... but she is not grand. And there are vocal problems as well. Gheorghiu has a good voice, but her lyric soprano cannot fulfill all the demands of the role. She sounds underpowered in some key moments and her important and very dramatic declamation at the end of the third act lacks a force that cannot be disguised simply  by hitting your chest. Don't get me wrong, hers is a comitted and very good performance that I would be glad to encounter live in any theatre. But unfortunately there are other recordings that show quite clearly what we're missing here. Particularly a Tokyo performance by Caball in 1976 (Adriana Lecouvreur [DVD] [2008]). I have rewiewed it already and won't repeat myself. To mention just one example, Gheorghious' Poveri fiori is very good, but Caballe's (sung in what seems a single breath) is pure magic. Gheorghiou is excellent, but Caball gave a legendary performance, very committed dramatically as well (so much for those that keep repeating she couldn't act); hers was singing for the ages. So by all means get this Covent Garden's recording. I will be returning to it for its overall excellence, great production and recording values, and Jonas Kaufmann's brilliant performance, both vocally and dramatically. But you should also give a chance to that Tokyo performance if you want to experience how magical Adriana de Lecouvreur (and opera) can be.",1334534400,49,3183,4.9588014981273405

8512697,5,B0079IJ17E,"I cannot find enough good things to say about this wonderful production of Cilea's neglected early twentieth century romantic masterpiece ""Adriana Lecouvreur"" from Covent Garden.  This was clearly a labor of love on the parts of Sir David McVicar, the Director, and of all of the cast and of the conductor Mark Elder.  Adriana has a somewhat problematic storyline.  If not properly presented, the opera can appear old-fashioned and excessively melodramatic.

David McVicar has overcome these intrinsic problems by setting the opera largely behind stage at the Comedie-Francaise in Paris extending the well-known concept of the stage within a stage.  He thus emphasizes the theatrical nature of all the characters even those who are not supposed to be actors in the actual story.  Adriana Lecouvreur herself moves rapidly between her real-life situation and her art often not appearing to distinguish between the two.

This opera requires great singing actors who also have the right appearances for their roles.  Angela Gheorghiu brings a wonderful quality to her difficult role.  She is a beautiful woman.  She portrays Adriana as a good-hearted, fragile, sympathetic and ultimately tragic character and I found her totally convincing in the role.  She like the other artists is assisted by exquisite eighteenth-century costumes.  In this regard one can only welcome David McVicar's honoring Cilea's intention of setting the opera in its correct time period namely Paris in the 1730s.  We do not need an Adriana Lecouvreur set in Las Vegas!

Ms. Gheorghiu's singing is terrific.  I thought that Sutherland did a better job of Adriana's entry aria - ""Io son l'umile ancella"" - but Ms. Gheorghiu's ""Poveri fiori"" is a tour de force of both singing and acting.  She looked truly exhausted and emotionally spent at the end of this famous aria.  Her declamatory skill as a diva is evident in the Phedre monologue in Act III which I found to be absolutely thrilling.

Jonas Kaufmann is the obvious first choice nowadays for any romantic opera which requires a great voice and a credible young, virile and handsome lover.  We saw that in his recent Werther at the Metropolitan Opera and we see it here even more when he plays Maurizio.  His ""La dolcissima effigie"" was spectacular.  His Act 2 aria ""L'anima ha stanca"" was extremely moving and magnificently sung.  He and Ms. Gheorghiu have wonderful chemistry in the love scenes, a chemistry one rarely sees in opera nowadays.

Olga Borodina is highly effective as the Princesse de Bouillon.  She not only sings beautifully but she manages with just her eyes and facial expressions to convey the Princess's venomous and scheming character.  Her ""Acerba volutta"" at the beginning of Act 2 is simply stunning.  She dominates the stage with her majestic presence whenever she appears.

Alessandro Corbelli, as Michonnet the stage manager at the Comedie-Francaise, shows all his skills as a singing actor.  He is subtle and poignant in the role of Adriana's friend and secret admirer and would be lover.  The warmth and chemistry between him and Ms. Gheorghiu made their scenes together wonderful and moving to behold.

The Blu-ray DVD is of superb quality.  The subtitles are modern without departing from the librettist's intent.  The music quality is astounding.  This DVD belongs in any opera lover's collection.  David McVicar has set a standard which I wish more opera directors would follow.  Like Adriana he respects what the composer intended.  I would hope that he could extend this treatment to new productions of other difficult and neglected operas like Ponchielli's La Gioconda and Giordano's Andrea Chenier and Fedora.  There are so many neglected and rarely performed operas from that period just waiting for the right director and cast to bring them back to life.

Adriana Lecouvreur has not been staged at the Royal Opera House since about 1904, two years after its world premiere at the Teatro Lirico in Milan with Caruso as Maurizio.  Opera lovers everywhere should be grateful that Covent Garden took the gamble of reintroducing this wonderful opera to the public.",1409961600,6,4125,5.127436281859071

I don't believe it was labeled as such at the time that i bought it.  It was therefore a disappointment, but it's probably a very good disc.",1403827200,,276,3.824561403508772
8512700,4,B0079IJ17E,"A great production of an opera best known for two arias: Io son lumile ancella and Poveri fiori, than for complete productions. The plot is somehow convoluted and not very interesting; a love triangle, infidelity, disguised characters, and so on.  The plot attempts to mix reality and fantasy, as experienced in the theater, but it really centers in the ardent love between Adriana and Maurizio, the Princess jealously hate, and the rivalry between two women, all very strong human feelings and emotions. Cileas music brings to the audience the depth of those emotions and feelings in a very romantic style, and it takes care to repeat, in different ways, the themes that evoke those emotions. Although there is more repetition of those central themes than in other Italian operas of the period, it is still effective and memorable.
This opera is not a popular one that is bound to receive many productions. I don't expect to have many recorded ones to choose from in the near future.  This recording has a first rate cast (GHheorghiu, Kaufmann, Borodina, Corbelli), a very nice, traditional and attractive staging (McVicar), and the Blu-Ray version has beautiful image captions and surround-sound. For an opera lover, this is a great opportunity to watch Cileas opera in a great overall production. I strongly recommend this Blu-ray, you will enjoy it.
The bonus interviews are of little value, they sound more like a sales pitch for the opera, or arguments to endorse the decision to stage this opera after more than 100 years of shelving it.",1399075200,5,1544,4.98062015503876
8512701,4,B0079IJ17E,"I have always had a soft spot for Adriana and was pleased to see this new release.  The visuals are terrific and Blu-ray makes them pop.  The orchestra sounds wonderful and nuanced and organic to the singing (no simple feat in this piece).  The singers are awesome in that they understand the difference between stage and video and bring a full range of expressions and acting to the project that it demands.  The leads also show brilliant control and resist the easy temptation to belt out every challenging passage, instead coloring them with sublime beauty.  The only fly in the ointment is that the upper range of soprano singing is not sweet (at least on my system that plays tons of other operas with no problems).  There is a splatter I associate with VHS quality recordings.  If I keep the volume soft it is less distracting, but then I miss Jonas' full performance.  Perhaps there is something wrong with my system, but this is the only DVD that produces that unwanted effect.  ps. it is four acts and I must admit that act III is a sleeper compared to the rest.",1393718400,,1071,4.56544502617801
