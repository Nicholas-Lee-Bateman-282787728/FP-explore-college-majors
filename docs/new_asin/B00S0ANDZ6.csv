8696708,5,B00S0ANDZ6,"Can't believe that I'm the first to review this live Hawklords DVD. Gig took place on November 2, 2013 at Bush Hall in London. Truly, captures the essence of a Hawkwind vibe and feel. Appears to be have been maybe filmed by avid fans - hey, that's fine by me. Full-on psychedelic light show, to say the very least. Only factor that caught me off-guard was that a good percentage of these songs are (still) very new to me, but I have to say they do fit in - very well. Loved the surprise opener ""Master Of The Universe"", the well-played ""Time Spent Vision"", 'D.N.A."", one I hadn't heard in awhile ""Uncle Sam's On Mars"", title track of their first -more- recent disc ""We Are One"", 'Machine Embrace"", ""Robot"", the awesome ""I Am The Wind"" and ""Damnation Alley"". Cannot recommend this DVD enough.",1493596800,,791,4.538461538461538
