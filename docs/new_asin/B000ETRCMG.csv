2534124,5,B000ETRCMG,This DVD is Awesome and  one of KoRn's best!  It is much more energetic and emotional than their  KoRn live DVD from 2002 which was good. But this is GREAT!  The set list is fantastiK and you get some great tracks like Dirty and a slighlty heavier version of Did my time. One of my favorite parts on the DVD is the concert intro that jonathan Davis wrote just for a Tour opener...so you won't get this track anywhere else...pretty sweet.  Get this DVD now and be sure to check out KoRn on the road this summer live at the Family Values tour!,1153785600,,541,4.213592233009709
2534125,3,B000ETRCMG,"I'M A KORN LOVER, BUT THIS DVD DOES NOT SHOW WHAT I WAS EXPECTING, IF YOU ARE A REAL KORN FAN YOU MUST HAVE IT NOW, BUT YOU'LL NOTE THAT ISN'T AS GOOD AS ""LIVE"" IS, WHAT I LIKE THE MOST WAS THE PEOPLE WHO WORK BEHIND THE BAND, SO BUY IT IN CASE YOU ARE A KORN FAN, IF YOU DON`T KEEP YOUR MONEY SAFE!",1152144000,2,299,3.5454545454545454
2534126,3,B000ETRCMG,"""Live On The Other Side"" -- a concert captured on the eve of the release of Korn's seventh studio album, ""See You On The Other Side"" marks Korn's first performance in the states since the exit of co-founding guitarist, Brian ""Head"" Welch. Since Korn have had a rather big year since the release of the album, it was only natural that a live DVD was released to celebrate (or capitalize) on it. This concert very well could have been Korn's victory lap. A reminder to everyone that the guys have  still got it and they are still vital. And although they are, this concert and overall package just doesn't show that.

Don't get me wrong. This is a good concert, good presentation, and decent extras. However, this is not Korn at their best. This concert was back in December, before the band really got their act together for their ""See You On The Other Side"" world tour. This means no back-up band, no cool imagery, and virtually no stage show. What this concert is, is the four members of Korn (and guitarist Rob Patterson stuffed in the back somewhere) simply rocking out the tried and true material at The Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. Now, had Korn waited a few months and released something documenting their world tour, this DVD could have easily been more exciting. Those who saw them more recently know what I'm talking about. Not only did the back-up band help fill the empty spots, with some unique visuals and stage set-up, but the band was also in top form. Here, on this DVD, they're a little rusty.

The setlist is a bit too safe as well. Basically, it's ""Greatest Hits, Vol. 1"" with a mere four songs from the new album. Sure, we all love hearing ""Got The Life"" ""Blind"" and ""A.D.I.D.A.S."" but for my money, the best part of the world tour was hearing old, but lesser-known favorites like ""Divine"" ""Clown"" and ""It's On"" mixing with the more experimental new stuff like ""Love Song"" and ""Tearjerker."" Everything about Korn's show clicked when I saw them. On this performance, however, it's a bit sterile, and need I say, overproduced. Considering this is a basic Korn concert, it would have benefited the whole production if they hadn't pro-tooled everything to death. But in it's defense, at least the cameras don't cut away every half-second, like on their last ""Live"" DVD (and there's no cheesy CGI images integrated either).

The extras are mixed. The ""Coming Undone"" music video actually isn't the music video. Just the live performance. The ""Jukebox,"" likewise, is worthless, as it just lets you select which performances to watch. However, a documentary that follows the band onboard a plane with some fans/contest winners is a real treat. Not only do you get to hear a completely warped version of ""Here To Stay,"" but you'll also see Patterson performing with the band, unmasked and unhidden. This feature itself probably would have made a better DVD than what we got. I'm a huge Korn fan, and I'm pretty disappointed with this. What could have been a great opportunity to show a revitalized band is just predictable, going through the motions. For some reason, Korn just can't get it right with their live DVD's, and I don't understand why. Just go see them live, as soon as possible. The real thing is much, much better.",1151625600,20,3250,4.716549295774648
2534127,3,B000ETRCMG,"To be honest when I watched this I was mad. Don't get me wrong Korn is an awesome band and it shows them live which is great. Although I went to see them on their latest tour and they put on one of the best stage shows I have ever seen, they had people in costume the lights everything. I bought this dvd hoping that it would be of them live using this stage show. I was dead wrong. It was before they started their tour and just put on an OK stage show. This wasn't what I was hoping for at all.",1151193600,3,496,3.825242718446602
2534128,4,B000ETRCMG,"I plan on purchasing the dvd, but I have already seen the performance as I was at the show.  I was in the balcony so I had a good view of everything.  The show was good, not the best but good none the less.  Korn should have recorded a performance from the ""see you on the other side"" tour, the setlist was much better.  This dvd has all the Korn hits, and a few new titles, but it lacks some of the older material that was on the syotos tour.  A reviewer had said that the band wasn't very active at this show, and i must say that they were active, but not as much as on the syotos tour.  All in all this is a must have for a Korn fan, but it could be better.  The only reason im really buying it is for the simple fact that i want to see if im on it at all.  If you have the ""korn live"" dvd from 2002 i believe, you pretty much have this one already.",1150934400,5,852,3.747191011235955
2534129,5,B000ETRCMG,"I thought it would be nice to add a review from someone who has actually seen this dvd.

I have seen it at home and on the big screen and WOW. It was a great show! A great mixture of songs from the new CD along with classic Korn. The way this DVD was filmed really makes you feel like you are right there at a Korn concert. Except you get the great view without getting pummeled in the pit. Oh and believe me they move and go nuts on stage! The setting in NY is a great choice because the crowd is fantastic.

Korn shows love for their fans like no other rock band as shown in some of the bonus footage which included them taking fans & US troops to NY on a private jet for the concert and playing a mini show on the plane (some of which was shown on Mtv2). Don't fall asleep on Korn's plane-you'll wake up taped to your seat! LOL.

Other bonus footage introduces you to some of the crew that have been with Korn for many many years which was cool to see also. Other hidden footage is already being found by fans by clicking around (similar to the Deuce dvd) so that's a nice extra surprise too.

All in all for a price lower then the cost of one concert ticket you can see a fantastic Korn show in your own living room!",1150761600,9,1220,4.008230452674897
2534130,3,B000ETRCMG,"ok, no one needs to take this review personally, so if you don't like it, do read it.

Anyways, Im not saying this band is nothing without Brian, but I haven't seen much pointing me against that fact since he left. The new album was awful in my opinion. It was filled with uninspired guitar riffs, fieldy lost his signature sound, david did his most boring drumming to date (see 'coming undone') and most of all, Jonathan's vocals were amazingly gay. the lyrics don't make sense half the time and he sings like hes hopped up on speed.

From any performance i've seen from Korn since Brian left, the band has done very weak. I completely disagree that they have more power and presence. Jonathan barely moves, Fieldy just sways and Munky doesnt do anything anymore. The lack of energy onstage baffles me.

Also, if i see one more person dressed up as a horse or rabbit onstage, i'll give up completely on this band, who ive been an avid fan of for almost 10 years.",1150588800,3,963,4.4602272727272725
2534131,5,B000ETRCMG,"KoRn has often been called the inventors of ""nu-metal"".  They don't care much for the label, but of course they've never adhered to any classification.  They push the boundaries every whichway that they can but always keep in mind the #1 priority: to ROCK.

This DVD, 4th of the band's (counting the awesome performance at CBGB's on the Greatest Hits DVD), is sure to continue that priority.

All KoRn fans know of the religiously-fueled departure of founding guitarist Brian ""Head"" Welch from the band over a year ago.  Though his out-of-the-blue (to us) exit was quite the blow for a lot of us, the rest of the band has certainly not been drug down.  If anything, they have become a more mighty beast, subtly modifying minor parts of their previous songs to rock harder as well as seeping with energy 10 fold of that before Head left (not to mention the incredibly innovative--if not a little TOO weird in a couple parts--latest album ""See You on the Other Side"").

Presenting to our screens performances of newer monster-songs like ""Liar"" and ""Hypocrites"" as well as bringing back the classics (with a now meaner edge) like ""Freak on a Leash"", ""A.D.I.D.A.S."", and--of course--""Blind"", this high-def., explosive DVD from one of the mightiest bands of our time is sure to rock your socks clean off!!!",1146700800,24,1301,4.833333333333333
2534142,1,B000ETRCMG,"I'm very disapointed with this product. First of all, the cover meterial is pretty bad, seems so fragile. Second and the more important, it doesn't work! I have 4 blu-ray movies and 6 blu-ray games and it never happened to me! I've put it on the PS3 console and the screen stayed black and after some seconds, the system delivered me a error message with a sequel of numbers (I don't remember right now which were).

So I recommend you to don't buy this product!

Remember that music Y'All Want a Single? That says: ""I think it's time to pay for everything you made me say"". So Korn, I've payed what you want, but where is my show?",1255046400,,631,4.338983050847458

The sound and video quality is just incredible and you really do get that concert feel. I think the best thing about this concert is that is basically their ""best of"" collection, at least to the general audience. Of course there were some songs that were left out that die hard fans would have liked to have heard, but I am overall impressed with this. I think there wasn't a time when I wasn't dancing in my living room with the volume practically full blast! You just can't keep still watching it. It is a really fun thing to have in your collection, especially if you are a fan!",1247788800,,691,4.125925925925926

2534150,4,B000ETRCMG,"Released in the Spring of 2006 (to hype the upcoming ""Family Values"" tour), ""Live on the Other Side"" is a decent live release from Korn, considering it was their first (or one of the first) live performances for the band after the departure of Brian ""Head"" Welch.  Jonathan makes reference to his absence at the end of the show.  While 2002's ""Live"" DVD (at the same venue) had a rusty band and an overweight and out of shape Jonathan, this show has all (now 4) members in top form.

However, the setlist is pretty basic, with a few songs from their ""See You On The Other Side"" album, with the rest being the usuals, such as ""Blind"", ""Freak on a Leash"", and ""Here to Stay"".  It would have been nice to see some rare stuff, but I think they, as they do with most releases, wanted to market this to the casual/former/non Korn fan.

There is an awesome MTV 2 special as an extra feature, which shows (parts of) the now infamous ""airplane"" performance the band gave to a group of contest winners, with battery powered amps.  The advertise a ""Coming Undone"" video, but it's just basically an extra song from the same live show.  A ""jukebox"" feature is also present, but it just lets you choose one of the songs from the show.  Kind of a throwaway.

The band would improve their live show over the next year, adding background singers and more visuals.  This is the second time they have released a Live DVD of a ""early"" performance.  I think a compilation of performances from several shows would be better.

Apparently, a Family Values 2006 DVD is in the works, so perhaps that what we'll get.  But, this is a good DVD, and worth picking up.  The film quality is quite good as well, with a softer picture than other concert DVD's.  Remember when MTV changed film styles for the Video Music Awards a few years back, from the bright, ""LIVE"" cameras to a more news-like, film style?  That's what you get here, and the sound is great, too.

Thumbs UP!",1159574400,,1943,4.458923512747876

8114162,2,B000ETRCMG,"Recorded live from the Hammerstein Ballroom(much like their Korn live Dvd) in 2005, ""Live on The Other side"" was the tour to support new album ""See You on the Other Side"" which was their first album to be recorded since the departure of guitarist Brian 'Head' Welch who had found God.

So Korn rather than replace 'Head' became a four piece, while that might be fine in the studio, you know for the live gig's they would need a replacement guitarist, which they got in Robert Patterson who wouldn't become an official member, in fact on stage you wouldn't even be allowed to see him as he is hidden behind the speakers!! Yet you still catch a glimpse of him here and there. It's all rather embarrassing, their's plenty of bands who have touring members on tour with them, yet they don't hide them.

The set list is mainly made up of older material, another thing to notice is that when they do the guitar solo in ""Another Brick In The Wall"" which used to be done by 'Head' but is now done by James 'Munky' Shaffer you realise he doesn't play it as good as him. 'Munky' Now being the main guitar player in the band now plays all 'Heads' parts and Patterson plays Munky's. Also for backing vocals such as in ""Somebody Someone"" 'Munky' now performs the backing vocals, however it's not the same. The older material stands out better than the material from ""See You On The Other Side"", songs such as ""A.D.I.D.A.S"", ""Got The Life"" and the brilliant ""Freak On A Leash"" sound great compared to ""Hypocrites"" and ""Liar"".

Their is a few extra's such as performing for competition winners on a plane, this time Patterson is not covered up(surely they could have hid him in the toilet or something). They of course now play with a guitarist in sight and a keyboardist, it's just a pity they didn't do that for this tour. Get the first live Korn dvd instead or Korn live at Montreux to see how good live this band really are! Are simply check them out next time they are in your area.",1302998400,,1972,4.457063711911357

Special features include a performance on an airplane with fans in tow.  Interesting idea, but the drowned out, weak sound just kills the songs.  Their previous live DVD ""Live"", which was performed on the release of their ""Untouchables"" CD, does a better job at capturing the real power of the band.  Overall, the essence of KoRn is intact with Jonathon, Munky and Fieldy but you feel the void left from ""Head"" on this DVD.",1259539200,,584,4.686274509803922
