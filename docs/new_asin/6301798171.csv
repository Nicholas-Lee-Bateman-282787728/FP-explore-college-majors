357628,3,6301798171,"It could have been a good movie, wasn't it pure bigotry: The narrating has an interesting structure, but finally, all what seems to be good and creative serves only the purpose of upholding family values in the most obvious and disgusting way: Leaving your family and intending to be independent causes paralysis (for you can't move any more with it), death or severe mental problems until you decide to come back. Even Bette Davis can't save the movie which is nevertheless sometimes touching. For anyone who speaks german, see my longer review on spielemagazin.de.",1290556800,,566,5.031914893617022
357629,5,6301798171,"Phone Call From A Stranger was far more powerful than I anticipated it would be. The plot moves along at a very good pace and the acting is extremely convincing. We get big name stars in this film, too: Keenan Wynn, Michael Rennie, Bette Davis, Gary Merrill, and Shelley Winters! The cinematography is pretty good although you can see that the plane is really just a miniature flying ""in the air;"" the cord holding the plane in mid-air is pretty visible. Sigh. However, the choreography is very well done.

When the film starts we quickly meet attorney David L. Trask (Gary Merrill) who's leaving his wife Jane because she was unfaithful to him. She begs him to stay but he can't forgive her and so he boards a plane board for California. As luck would have it, the plane is going to have to take off late because of a very intense rain storm; so it isn't long before we also meet three other people traveling on the same plane with David Trask: Binky Gay (Shelley Winters) is an armchair psychologist who worked as a stripper to make ends meet after her marriage started to have trouble and she wanted to be a star in the theater; and there's Dr. Robert Fortness (Michael Rennie) who has a long history of alcoholism and a very dark secret to hide from the police. We also meet traveling salesman and practical jokester Edmund Vincent 'Eddie' Hoke (Keenan Wynn).

David and the other three people meet and chat in the airport restaurant before leaving Chicago; and they continue to make fast friends on their trip westbound both onboard the plane and when they stop outside of Salt Lake City. They exchange each other's phone numbers with the exception of David Trask, who can't give information about his whereabouts in California because he's traveling there and doesn't know where he'll be staying yet. This turns out to be for the best, unfortunately, because the airplane crashes and David Trask is the sole survivor of the crash.

After some treatment for his wounds, David Trask is quite lucky in that he's fully ambulatory and just has a few scratches left to heal. David also decides to visit the family members of the now deceased friends he made on that flight so they can hear what their deceased relatives really and truly wanted them to know.

The plot can go anywhere from here; and there are more than just one or two surprises. David Trask must meet with family members who are bitter or who didn't really understand or know everything they really should have known about the departed. In addition, look for Bette Davis to steal the show with a stunning performance closer to the end of the picture.

The DVD has a few extras which include an example of how they cleaned up the film to make it digital; but I must confess I didn't see any major differences between the two copies of the print. We get a theatrical ""teaser"" and a theatrical trailer as well.

Phone Call From A Stranger packs a big punch and I highly recommend it for fans of the stars on this movie as well as people who enjoy classic movies that remain relevant in our times. The movie deals with the ""double standard"" of marital morality and that's very interesting, too.",1236470400,15,3157,4.5985790408525755
357630,3,6301798171,This movie is a kind of a precursor of Peter Weir's Fearless. It is mainly about bereavement and how we deal with it. The subject matter is treated in an un-melodramatic way and with tact. Bette Davis is very strong as the bedridden wife who meets the survivor of a plain crash in which her husband died.,1229040000,3,304,4.350877192982456
357631,4,6301798171,"As the sole survivor of a plane crash, Gary Merrill becomes dedicated to tying up all of the loose ends of his friends who died in the crash. While mending the lives of others, he discovers a way to mend his own.

The problem I had with this film is that I really expected it to be a Bette Davis picture. I was very disappointed to find that after waiting for over half the movie, Bette's part was only a cameo. She gives a great performance in the film, and her sad saga could break your heart, but it wasn't what I had expected.

However, when I reevaluated this film, I actually quite enjoyed it. Shelley Winters is quite comical, and Gary Merrill is all man. The plot is original, and the stories of the passengers aboard the doomed flight range from hilarious to tear-jerking. It's at least worth a rental.",1215388800,8,811,4.364238410596027
357632,5,6301798171,"I have waited years for this terrific film to come out on DVD. Though a trifle melodramatic by today's jaded standards, there is an endearing quality to this film. The cast is perfect, yes, even Davis playing against type!, especially Merrill. Fascinating, thoughtful and absorbing film. Very glad it is finally out. Once started you cannot stop viewing- even for a bathroom break!",1207785600,17,381,5.063492063492063
357633,5,6301798171,"Engrossing film about a man (Gary Merrill) who befriends a small group of fellow passengers on a plane trip. When the plane crashes, he alone survives. Disturbed by the stories the people he befriended told him about their lives, he sets out to contact their families and help set things straight. In doing so, he brings healing to them and to himself with his own problems. The passengers include Keenan Wynn as an overly gregarious salesman bragging about his ""sexy"" wife and Shelley Winters as a stripper whose mother-in-law had no respect for her. Bette Davis appears as the widow of a victim with a tragic story of her own. The stories are told episodically as Merrill contacts each family. This is one of Merrill's finest performances. He was married to Davis at the time. Entire cast is excellent and their stories are touching and tragic with slight dashes of humor. A worthwhile film that is entertaining and with a timely message about forgiveness. Enjoy.",1201132800,59,965,4.8545454545454545
357634,5,6301798171,"Even though she had only a small part in the movie, Bette Davis does a marvelous job.  Great movie which follows the lives of 4 people and their families whose fate intersects during a tragedy.",1142467200,5,193,4.514285714285714
357635,5,6301798171,"Bette Davis gives a man the strength to save his marriage.

A plane crash puts an end to the sufferings of three ill-fated passengers but leads to a second chance for the fourth, a man who believes his wife no longer loves him. Starring Gary Merrill, Shelley Winters, Keenan Wynn, and Michael Rennie as the passengers and Bette Davis in a standout performance as an invalid widow who seeks to guide the survivor on a journey to understanding. Phone Call From A Stranger boasts the unbeatable combination of a brilliant cast and an engraving plot line. It is a movie that will inspire as well as move you.

This is a fabulous inspiring movie that I highly suggest to all.",1136851200,11,670,4.575
357636,2,6301798171,"Despite the prominence of Bette Davis and Shelley Winters on the video cover, Gary Merrill is actually the star of ""Phone Call from a Stranger.""  He plays a lawyer who visits the families of several people he met on a doomed flight.  During these visits, he solves many of their problems and has an epiphany of his own.  The movie has a terrific cast, including three Oscar winners (Davis, Winters, and Beatrice Straight).  Unfortunately, the film is overly melodramatic, replete with swelling music and over-the-top breakdowns.  Fans of Bette Davis also will likely be disappointed, as she has a small part (that really doesn't fit her well) and doesn't appear until near the end.  She likely appeared in this film as a favor for her then-husband - Merrill.  Overall, this film is a typical 50s melodrama: not terrible but entirely forgettable.",1093132800,7,845,4.950354609929078
357637,1,6301798171,"This was a very BORING film. Bette Davis's picture shouldn't even be on the cover because she's in the film for about a minute in a half! Okay, maybe alittle longer than that but not by much! Don't waste precious time on this one when there are so many really good ones to see.",1001203200,6,277,4.148148148148148
357768,3,6301798171,"People get on a plane. Some live. Some don't. One of the survivors visits the other passengers' (who died) relatives/friends to relay information about the dead.

Nothing special. Nothing horrible. Kinda preachy in certain parts I guess. But might have just been the era. . . over-the-top acting. Dunno. I watched the entire movie. And of course it does help you think about what-if. But I wouldn't say this movie was something you should run out and see. I saw it because I like Merrill, especially in most of his movies with Davis. I should also say that Davis's part in this movie was so miniscule and so late in the film that I hardly see how she is given top billing here. Oh well.",1415577600,,686,4.488
357769,3,6301798171,"Not one of Bette's best.  Moderately entertaining but you could see that she and Gary Merrill (her then husband) didn't play well off each other as actors (or spouses).  The only movie I thought they were great in together was ""All About Eve""....a Fabulous Movie of an aging (over 35) stage actress.  But Phone Call from a Stranger lacked punch and it felt like a lack luster play.  Okay but not worth the view, in my opinion.",1413676800,2,426,4.4935064935064934

357774,4,6301798171,"This movie is worth it just to see Bette Davis in a particularly compromising position.  She was a brilliant actress.  Phone call from a stranger is not a suspense film. All but one moment are obvious from the start. There is also one very beautiful moment in the film that makes me tear up even though I know it's coming. Beautifully done, memorable and delightful.  It only loses a star because Bette Davis doesn't come into the film earlier.",1372896000,5,444,4.594936708860759

7815115,5,6301798171,"PHONE CALL FROM A STRANGER falls into the ""they don't make movies like this anymore"" category. Long gone are the days when movies relied solely on a great cast and a fantastic story. It's not about the visual effects or violence or sex but about the story and the lives of people.

David Trask (a fine Gary Merrill) leaves his unfaithful wife for Los Angeles to clear his mind. On the flight, he meets three eccentric people including Binky Gay (a young and lovely Shelley Winters). The old foursome form a bond when bad weather forces an unexpected layoff. They each confide their secrets to Trask and give him their phone numbers as they have become the Four Musketeers. Very simple plot line that has a very surprising twist. After a tragedy, Trask finds it his mission to sort out the lives of the families of his three new friends.

It's an amazingly simple story with a strong message of love and hope. Although Bette Davis may be listed as a star, she has a small but pivotal role at the end of the film. This is acting at its finest that includes Michael Rennie and Keenan Wynn. Yes, that is Hugh Beaumont (LEAVE IT TO BEAVER) in a small role. Here is one of those forgotten gem that a classic film buff will love.",1489363200,,1222,4.426666666666667
