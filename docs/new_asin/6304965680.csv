945133,2,6304965680,"Although I am a great fan of movie adaptations of books, this is one of the most disappointing of that genre that I have seen in a long time.  It seems the author has gone out of her way to leave out some of the most endearing characters (the Lawrences are nonexistent, and the Brookes--especially Daisy&Demi--are shells of Alcott's characters), while Jack and Emil are central characters.  Although the actors are entertaining, I have to wonder at the casting director's choices; not one character looks as they are described by Alcott.  Additionally, crucial scenes (like Nat's entry to Plumfield and Dan's homecoming) lack that certain something, while precious minutes are spent on games of sticknife and boxing matches.  Although the actors do their best, character development is almost nill--disapppointing when Alcott spent so much time on personalities in the book.
Basically, if you have never read ""Little Men"" you might enjoy this, but if you are expecting anything resembling the book--don't get your hopes up.",1005523200,7,1023,5.181818181818182
945134,4,6304965680,"The Movie is very good. But READ THE BOOK. The movie left out lots of important people, and most of where Mr. Brooke comes, its actually, Laurie in the book. But the movie is superb!!! If you like the movie, you will definitly love the book. In the movie there is no Bess, Rob, Josie, Laurie, Amy....all the important people. I like the way the movie was produced. But I think my imagination was much better. I don't want to sound negative, this movie is worth more than 10 stars, but my personal opinion is of not of that deal. My Parents loved that movie, and I think they're ready to give thousand stars. Any ALCOTT books and movies are a great deal reading and watching!!!!!",1002585600,,678,4.388888888888889
945135,5,6304965680,"This film is most probably the best movie ever! I loved it so much! As I live in England, it is unavalible and I can't find a copy anywhere so I taped it and watch it at least five times a day! Me and my cousin have ""Praise the little men parties!"" Don't think we're sad, it's a brilliant film but the best part was obviously Dan played by the best actor in the world ""Ben Cook"" Ben, if u read this I love u!

945136,5,6304965680,"I liked the plot for this movie--but as many people have said, Jo was just not Jo in the movie. But that is okay since the younger actors backed her up. I enjoyed watching Dan as he taught all the boys something in the barn and I would like to see him (Ben Cook) in more movies.",973900800,5,278,3.8947368421052633
945137,5,6304965680,"The part that really touched me was when Nat was caught lying and instead of getting hit with the ruler, was told to hit the master's hand with the ruler.  You could see the hurt in his eyes and how sorry he felt in his heart as he was striking out with the ruler.  I think this is a lesson for all of us: that children are basically good and want to do good.  The extended lesson is that people are basically good and want to do what is good and that we have consciences that judges right from wrong.  It also shows that love is stronger than violence and muscle. This was a very memorable movie for me.  All the actors and actresses did a supberb job.",969840000,2,653,4.0703125
945138,4,6304965680,"I enjoyed this movie. Despite that, I found several faults with it. The casting of the adults in the movie was completely wrong. Mariel Hemmingway just isn't Jo (anyone who loves the book will understand what I mean)!  Chris Sarandon was not at all right for Fritz. The child actors, however,  saved the movie. Dan (Cook) and Nat (Caloz) were superb. Recommended.",961372800,8,363,4.838709677419355

Although it omits a few minor details (even slightly misrepresenting a couple certain events - check the book), this movie stays true to the book. The characters are masterfully played by excellent actors, and the atmosphere of the film maintains that nostalgic essence of days gone by. Packed full of timeless lessons - from learning compassion to the meaning of what a man really is - Little Men is a film for the whole family to enjoy time after time.",1436918400,3,509,4.604395604395604

945595,4,6304965680,"I read Little Men out loud to my children and they loved it.  And although they liked the movie, they were confused as to why the movie seemed to zero in on  Dan and Nat and the other characters seemed minor, including Joe and her husband.  I don't think it captured the essence of the book which was Joe and her husband's visionary thinking of how to raise and educate boys and the different ways they did that.  But I guess that would have made for a long movie.  We did enjoy the movie, but as most movie's go, fell short of the book.",1375142400,,537,4.125

945598,5,6304965680,I really enjoyed this movie so much.  I first saw it on TV and it quickly became one of my favorites.  I didn't really compare it to the book but what I liked about it was the wholesomeness for the entire family as well as all the moral lessons and the way that the transformation of Dan is ultimately displayed in the transformation of the unbroken horse to one that's trained.  Ben Cook is a real cutie and I guess that helps some also.  It reminds me of meditative concepts with regards to an unbroken horse and finally mastering and taming it,1354060800,,546,4.323529411764706
945599,4,6304965680,"Don't let the reviews of this film turn you completely away.
It's a fun film, especially if you watch it with appreciating children, and worth at least one viewing.

Though it is abridged somewhat disappointingly, I thought this version was entertaining. It is true that Jo is just not Jo in this film (where's the spunk?), but I rather liked Chris Sarandon as Friedrich, even though his portrayal is rather more rough than Alcott's character (hey, let's just be thankful Bhaer was in this version at all--I love this character.) The children cast was good, if not occasionally cheesy in their line delivery.

Actually, the only things I really disliked about this version was the narration, (which seemed only to exist to fill gaps from where they skipped over places), the lack of Laurie and Rob Bhaer, or any other Marches, and how they handled John Brooke's death...but this is coming from someone who has re-read all of these books so many times, no movie could ever live up to my high expectation of its charm.

So yes, watch this movie, and look over its faults. I was just so relieved to find that the makers had respected the book and kept Fritz that the movie is thereby fantastic.",1347926400,5,1191,4.688995215311005
945600,5,6304965680,"Love the movie!  Disappointed that it does not come in DVD form.  We have the VHS and are converting all to DVD as we can afford it; however, this movies was not available in DVD - something I did not catch until after ordering it!",1325203200,4,231,4.111111111111111
945601,4,6304965680,"This is a well done version of Little Men that stays true to the book with one exception: Mr. Brooke.  As someone else notes, it is Laurie that does most of what Brooke does in the movie.  The children are excellent in the film and it has a lot of good messages.  It is not high action or modern, but it is true to the heart of the actual book.  It's worth a rental for sure!  I just read the book and then watched this and liked both.",1312502400,,435,3.897727272727273
945602,4,6304965680,"This is one of the best versions of Little Men that I've found. My friends didn't like it as much, but I loved it! The character of Jo should be a bit younger, but the actors do a great job! They changed a few of the facts around from the book (i.e. Mr Booke supports Nat instead of Laurie) but most of the main things are great! I also think that Chris Sarandon does a GREAT job as professor bhaer. On the hole, LOVE IT!",1290470400,,421,3.9647058823529413
945603,1,6304965680,"This movie was a grave disappointment to me, but perhaps that is because I first saw the television series ""Little Men"" (now available here at amazon.com on VHS/DVD).  I thought Mariel Hemingway's portrayal of Jo Bhaer was deplorable - no emotion, no spunk...no personality.  The boys were entertaining at times, but with Jo being so bland and cardboard-like, the movie was terrible.  I recommend purchasing the TV show ""Little Men,"" but beware that there is no Fritz Bhaer on the show.  Being a L.M. Alcott enthusiast, I actually did not mind the elimination of Fritz, especially since his ""replacement"" is a much better fit for Jo.",1053475200,8,633,4.943396226415095
945604,3,6304965680,"This should be three and a half stars, but I don't know how to do that :). Personally, I thought this was a good movie. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen. It did leave out a lot of important characters, so that when I read the book later I was a little confused. But the actors were great. Ben Cook did a great job with the movie's Dan (I say that to differentiate between the Dan portrayed in the movie and the slightly different Dan in the book). He is a good actor and I'm sorry to see he didn't go farther with his career. The girls were pretty good too, and the movie altogether caught a feel of innocence that the book also had, regardless of which characters were ""perfect"" for which roles. I gotta recommend this to you because, while the film wasn't fantastic, it really wasn't all that bad either.",1023667200,4,813,4.251612903225807

I would strongly recommend that people watch this film as it is a sensitive and wonderful family film. People will fall in love with this film the minute they watch it.",1473811200,,483,4.204301075268817
