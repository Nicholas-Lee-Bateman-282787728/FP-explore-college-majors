7947395,5,B00005NKST,"The rating above is for another movie by the same title about a young woman diagnosed with cancer, but who overcomes it. This is not the same movie, nor is it the movie I was looking for. It's with Sam Niell and Ann Archer and is a wonderful, heartwarming, uplifting story.",1252886400,3,273,4.372549019607843
