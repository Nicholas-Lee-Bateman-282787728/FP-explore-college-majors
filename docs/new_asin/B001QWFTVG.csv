8336657,5,B001QWFTVG,"Growing Green Babies is a delightful and insightful little video that health conscious parents should watch.

Sara Snow covers a lot of ground in a fun way: through conversations with two mothers. Some of the topics are food, furniture, paint, cleaning supplies, and diapers (can you believe a baby can use over 5,000 diapers!).

The program is a broad overview with very specific recommendations and low cost solutions that, in some cases, can be implemented with simple products most people already have at home.

Watching whetted my appetite to do some more research.  Once again I am impressed by a Gaiam product.

The only criticism I have is that I wish the recipes and recommendations were printed out or a website URL reference were provided.

Enjoy!",1412294400,,758,4.976190476190476
8336658,5,B001QWFTVG,"This documentary is an absolute must for all expecting parents ! I have been doing a lot of reading and research about this topic prior to seeing the documentary so a lot of it was a solid confirmation of what I have been learning, but I still gleaned new and useful information from the DVD. This is a true eye opener for most people who are used to being sold baby products as part of an enormous and profitable industry. It sheds light on how harmful a lot of the things we expose our babies/children to. You will see that it is important to get solid wood baby furniture with no or low VOC paints, avoid plastic toys, go with an organic mattress, eat organic/healthy foods while pregnant and breastfeeding, using natural cosmetics for you and baby, etc. At the least this documentary will provide a starting point in your research so you can make informed decisions on what works best for your family ! I will be sure to pass this dvd around to expecting friends as it is an enlightening experience for new and overwhelmed moms.

The only setback is I wish it was longer and more detailed but I think if the various topics she discusses pique your interest, it's good to go out and do more thorough research. She goes over some things very briefly, like cloth diapers and healthy disposable diapers.",1412294400,,1303,4.521186440677966

8336660,5,B001QWFTVG,"My husband and I bought this DVD when we found out we were expecting our first. There is a lot of great information in this DVD. They talk about everything from nutrition to preparing the home for baby. Both my husband and I found the DVD helpful. We are even thinking about passing it along to our parents to help them understand some of our choices. For example, limiting plastic toys in our home due to the harmful chemicals they may contain. Sometimes information comes best from a third party!",1313971200,,498,4.544444444444444
