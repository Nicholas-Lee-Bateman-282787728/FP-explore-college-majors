Lucky I have a VCR player that stroll works and I was able to enjoy this film. The movie itself is very short and the dubbing is sooooo bad its good. It's an older anime so the content has nudity and Gorey violence. (Content restrictions were very loss back then and are a lot more strict now.) Despite this I definetly recommend watching this amazing movie, definetly worth your time or atleast it was for me.",1453939200,,519,4.473684210526316
7847356,4,6303447112,"Devilman is my one of my all-time favorite animes, but my advice to you, and this is good advice mind you, DON'T get the English dubbed...  Buy the Subtitled version.  The voice actor for Devilman/Akira in the Dub is absolutely horrible.  I saw the the subtitled first, fell in love, but bought the Dub.  It was a mistake....  Take my word for it.",969494400,,347,4.444444444444445
7847357,5,6303447112,"This movie is great! It is loaded with tons of blood, gore, and graphic violence. It has a really cool story also. The voices in the dubbed version are really cool. There is not enough anime horror out there but this and  Vampire Hunter D(re-released Jan. 15! Buy it now, kids!)are definitely the  best in my book. I own both volumes of this and it is really sad that there  is apparently no plan for a third one at the time. This could be a truly  great series!",945907200,5,462,4.215909090909091
