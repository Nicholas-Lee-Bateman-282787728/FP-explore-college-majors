2230384,1,B0007PID84,"This was a complete snooze job. It's hard to get behind a film where the protagonist is a pedophile especially when his main objective is to simply not abuse kids anymore.the main character of the film does nothing for an hour and a half. If the movie accomplishes anything it is a natural alternative remedy for insomnia. The message here  is ""pedophiles are people too"". They are cursed with a horrible affliction. This would've been much more compelling as a documentary. Extremely boring as a narrative feature.",1524960000,,515,4.919540229885057
2230385,4,B0007PID84,A well made movie about a sensitive subject that far to many people just throw anger at rather then looking at and dealing with the problem with maturity which I feel like this movie does very well. Interesting well acted characters that have depth and realism.,1524960000,,261,4.695652173913044
2230386,5,B0007PID84,"Bravo! Kevin Bacon and his wife did a marvelous job in this movie. The movie makes you feel sorry for Bacons character, but hate the other pedophile who is stalking the boys. Its a tough subject to present in a film and they did a good job.",1524787200,,240,4.127659574468085
2230387,1,B0007PID84,"A pro pedophilia film.  Trying to make the child abuser a sensitive character is beyond vulgar.  Kevin Bacon, as a father should be ashamed.",1524787200,,140,4.791666666666667
2230388,4,B0007PID84,"As far as the film itself, its shortcoming is its slow and somewhat inconsequential plot. However, it wholly makes up for this in the writing, cinematography, and depiction of the characters. Bacon tackles a very difficult and uncomfortable role, and delivers well. The bleak scenery helps add to its feel. Overall, pretty solid for what it is.

 I don't think most people reviewing this film are really understanding the point. Everyone thinks it's a cheap sympathy ploy for a pedo, or that simply depicting such a character on film is contemptible. This is the drivel of someone barely willing to scratch the surface, and quite incapable of critical thinking. I mean, if you can read the description and do not want to watch this film, you have that choice, exercise it. Yes, this film can be uncomfortable. This is both expected and intentional. You aren't supposed to either sympathize with or hate Bacon's character. You are meant to face the reality and see that monsters are just humans among us, all around. Not only that, these monsters fight the demons within. This film skillfully balances the honest and sincere attempts at progress made by Bacon's character and his struggle to cope and inevitable downward spiral to being a potential and very real threat to society once again. This is not to debate whether this disorder is curable, this is just to demonstrate the cruel reality of the struggle, for both abuser and victim.

Honestly, if you watched most or all of this film, only to pass it off in a short review as garbage because of how it made you feel, why are you bothering? Congratulations on at least finishing it, and writing your very elementary and knee-jerk review, I guess.",1524700800,,1701,4.838487972508591
2230389,3,B0007PID84,"The plot is more about having empathy for child sex offenders than the victims.  Not sure why it was directed that way, but definitely not ok.  If you have nothing else to do I guess watching this is better than nothing.",1524528000,,220,4.341463414634147
2230390,5,B0007PID84,"however difficult this is to watch, I think it has value as an initiator of thought and conversation. We don't know much about sexual predators, how their sexual preference is determined, how such can be ""managed,"" etc. And our culture suffers because of it. We can't change what we don't understand.

I have new respect for Kevin Bacon, whom I've always considered a lightweight. He is absolutely believable in this very, very challenging role.",1524441600,,445,5.013513513513513
2230391,4,B0007PID84,"Good story line about a dark and underreported crime. Sedgewick and Bacon did great jobs portraying both a victim and perp of this blight on society worldwide. At least they didn't minimize Bacon's guilt; it was shown he was still a potential victimizer. Only now through his relationship with a grown woman, who was molested herself, maybe he can see the harm he caused in the past and won't ever again say he didn't ""hurt"" them.  It's hard to watch this stuff, but hopefully the laws will get stiffer when it's proved that a few years in prison does NOT prevent future back slides..It needs to be life.",1524355200,,604,4.592592592592593
2230392,1,B0007PID84,"I watched this  movie all the way to the end and wish I hadn't wasted my time.  It never gets interesting in the least.  It's a pro pedophilia propaganda piece in which I'm supposed to sympathize with the pedophile and root for him as he almost molests a girl but stops when she starts crying?

And then he's some vigilante who beats up other pedo's, and gosh if the police would just stop giving pedophiles such a hard time maybe they could solve all these child rape cases, ridiculous.

This is a cut and dry case of Hollywood pushing a pro pedophile agenda, there's no two ways to look at it.",1524355200,,595,4.324324324324325
2230393,1,B0007PID84,"I'm no prude, but I found myself wondering why anyone would make this movie. Is the viewer supposed to feel some sort of sympathy or understanding for the plight of pedophiles? Who cares about the angst of a grown man who destroys the lives of innocent children? Not me. Maybe other pedophiles think this is an important story to be told, but I wish I hadn't hit the play button (I quit half way through), because I will always wonder why a cast of grade-A actors decided this was an important project for them.",1524268800,,511,4.446808510638298
2230433,4,B0007PID84,"Really unexpected story of compassion and change. Extremely well-acted by an exceptional cast, this movie will leave you with a little bit of a dirty feeling that makes you want to take a bath. It gives you a glimpse of a depraved soul, and makes you summon empathy, which is not a comfortable place to be, but you're glad you went along for the journey, anyway.",1524096000,,362,4.5
2230434,2,B0007PID84,"I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. On the one hand, the acting, writing, directing, etc. were very well done. Better than 90% of the movies on Prime, and that's saying everything right there. BUT... I feel like they wanted the viewer to feel some sort of compassion for the main character, and I just didn't. I agreed with everything that his parole officer, who is hostile toward him, said to him (namely that people like him should never be released). If he weren't a pedophile who we still see trying to groom little girls, following them around, etc (and then deciding not to go through with it, I guess), then I'd feel compassion for him. As it stands, I thought he was the POS that other people treated him as. The female character, I feel, is a complete idiot. So... I wasn't able to get into this movie because the characters are terrible people at their core.",1524009600,,875,4.475

2230437,5,B0007PID84,Very well acted and directed. Made me feel conflicting feelings from one scene to the next.

2230440,3,B0007PID84,"Although the acting in this movie is great, the message - if indeed there is a message - is warped.

Are we to identify and empathize with Walter?  Can his transgressions be forgiven?  Can he be rehabilitated?  Should he be given the chance?  If the answer to these questions is YES, as the movie suggests, where is the empathy for Candy?  Even fellow pedophile Walter cannot empathize with him.

The Bible teaches us that, through Jesus Christ, all sin (e.g., pedophilia, adultery, homosexuality, bearing false witness, drunkenness, murder, etc.) can be forgiven.  Based on its destructive nature, man - not the Bible - regards some sin as more egregious than other.  We have heard some sin, such as alcoholism, homosexuality, and pedophilia, described as ""mental disorder"" or ""disease"".  Though I do not object to these descriptions, ""genetic predisposition"" is probably a more accurate description.  Alcoholics are genetically more susceptible to alcohol abuse, homosexuals are genetically more susceptible to homosexuality, and pedophiles are genetically more susceptible to pedophilia.  All are sin, all can be overcome, and all can be forgiven.",1523404800,,1150,5.363128491620111
2230441,2,B0007PID84,"While this movie touches on some very deep and complex real life parallels, the movie itself is somewhat depressing and boring, and as a result, not very entertaining. It gave me a little perspective about human sexuality, especially from a male perspective. That is, that there is all levels of sexual complexity in human beings (and again from the male perspective), from the benign semi-sexual attraction of men to young or pubescent girls, to Oedipus complex, to outright criminal sexual molestation or rape (and all levels in between). And so this film brought that into perspective a little more for me. However, I cannot recommend the film given how many good movies are out there for your entertainment or viewing pleasure",1523232000,,730,5.041322314049586

2230454,4,B0007PID84,"THE WOODSMAN is a real tough luck story.

Walter (Kevin Bacon) is a convicted child molestor released on probation after serving 12 years of a life sentence. After returning to his hometown, Walter's rehired at a lumberyard based on a previous good work record there. Even living across the street from a nmiddle school, Walter keeps out of trouble. Things seem to be going well until this overly nosy secretary, played by one-named ""Eva,"" finds out Walter's secret, prints his rap sheet off the internet and hands out copies to everyone at work. ""They have a right to know"" is her justification.

Naturally he becomes the target of threats, violence and in one instance, an act of sabotage that could've seriously injured Walter if he didn't notice the nail driven into a board he was making slices in with a radial arm saw. Enraged, Walter leaves his job after this near incident.

Walter's life isn't totally bleak. He's got a girlfriend (Kyra Sedgwick) who wants Walter to move in with her. Vickie has her own reasons: three older brothers who ""poked"" her (to used the character's words), ""in chronological order."" She just wants to understand what makes guys behave inappropriately with young girls. So perhaps these two complete each other.

He's also keeping an eye on a molester of young boys. An eventual confrontation with this guy is the story's dramatic highlight.

For anyone concerned with the unsavory background of this film's main character, the only genuinely repulsive moment is when Walter has Vickie sit on his lap, just like he did with all those sweet young things in the old days. You get a non-explicit idea of how he pleasured himself-- apparently via auto-eroticism, nothing that involved intimate contact with the child's body. Vickie however, is sickened at the thought that her boyfriend may still be ""that way."" It's an issue they have to immediately sort out.

""The Woodsman"" ultimately makes us sympathetic to the plight of an ex-con trying to put his life straight, a man that going in you'd never imagine caring one whit about. Currently rated 7.3 at IMDb, it co-stars David Alan Grier and Benjamin Bratt.",1437523200,,2140,4.914127423822714
2230455,5,B0007PID84,"I can't believe this movie is not more widely known, since the acting of everyone in it and the content are, incredible. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the actors or just wants a smart movie about this highly taboo mental illness that societies just can't seem to be able to discuss aloud.",1428796800,,314,4.338983050847458
2230456,1,B0007PID84,"I have repeatedly heard that Pedophilia is a mental illness of which there is no cure; that when convicted and then released they will repeat the crime.  Even in this particular movie where a strong attempt is made to humanize the person with the problem the character tells the woman he is sleeping with that  people don't understand; he did not hurt anyone.  Are you kidding me?!  Hurting someone is not ONLY a violence within the sex, in the instance of rape (and more gruesome still the rape of a child!) it is the sexual act itself that hurts the victim.  Yes, I agree that people who molest children are sick & while you have every right to have empathy for them that doesn't mean they should be out in the streets.  This movie shows still the incredible struggle this man has while seeing a cute young girl and befriending her, not sexually but clearly fighting it.  Somebody wrote in another review that this has a somewhat happy ending.  Really?  I didn't see that.  I see a man who eventually if given enough time and clearly had circumstance readily available would strike again and be sexual with yet another young girl.  More than anything else though I was disappointed because I expected a movie going by the reviews that was really interesting and was definitely open and ready for that.  Instead it was actually a bit boring besides the beginning, I thought about the first half hour was the best.  It went downhill from there. I will say it certainly was low key and didn't reach for any ridiculous dramatics which was good but all in all it just could not hold my interest. I saw this because I just before saw Loverboy with Kyra Sedgwick and she was amazing; she was great in this also but had a much smaller role.  Kevin Bacon did well, the acting was fine.  Overall I thought it attempted to humanize adults who molest children and I already realize they are human and they have a problem but even this movie if you really scrutinize it does not advocate having them; on the streets hence the struggle of Kevin's character not to touch another child inappropriately and for me, it looked like it would take no more than six months until he did this again to another child.",1427673600,,2194,4.532994923857868

Bacon, as Walter, is again tremendous, and he is surrounded by uniformly fine performances (most notably from Sedgwick, his real life partner).  Whether intentionally or not the filmakers have made Walter sympathetic; illustrated in a number of ways but none stronger than in his failure to fully capitalise on an opportunity to re-offend (this scene in the park is equally chilling and heartbreaking).  So, is there hope for Walter?  And here is where audiences will be divided as many will believe that he simply does not deserve any.  Excellent work.",1421366400,,703,4.915254237288136

2230465,3,B0007PID84,"Interesting to watch, an independent movie by someone w/ an idea they wanted to try.  Not commercial.  However some of the cuts were odd, some of the scenes it felt like I wasn't watching real people, but rather actors trying to act impressively.  I was mildly curious how the story would play out, but I didn't have an incredible amount of empathy for any of the characters, and so was not that caught up in the story.

(This paragraph, mild spoiler alert)  The scenes where they have him following and make friends w/ an underage girl were implausible to me.  We were supposed to be worried-- is he going to fall off his horse and go back to harming children?  And then be like, heart-warmed that not only does he want to just be her friend, but he wants to protect her from being abused by someone else who is abusing her.  The problem with that was we needed a few more steps showing us a change in him so he is not attracted to kids anymore.  (Most of those guys can't be rehabilitated, apparently, so it needs more than just a ""now I feel this way cuz that's what the script says I should feel"").

*In conclusion*  If you really like movies, especially independant film, or crime stories, or the actors in this movie, maybe you will enjoy this as ""one more"" movie to watch.

In the extra footage, the producer goes through a lot melodramatic theatrics about what a terribly taboo subject matter it was and how it took such courage to produce the film. Bollocks. It's not like this movie is anywhere nearly as dramatic or graphic as something like Mysterious Skin. Granted, it deals with child molestation, but the notion that this movie is uncovering details of it in novel or graphic ways is absolutely not true. With such a heavy topic, movie could have been way more edgy and intense. Instead it kind of pussy-footed around the topic while focusing on the inner turmoil of the perpetrator.

2230473,4,B0007PID84,"The Woodsman opens with convicted pedophile Walter (Kevin Bacon) returning home after a twelve year stint in prison. Not surprisingly, he finds that his entire support network has evaporated. After all, who wants to be associated with a pedophile?

But how blurred the criteria of social condemnation can be. In the late eighties the glam metal band Winger had a song called Seventeen in which the slimy lead singer Kip Winger crooned of bedding down with a girl perhaps in her senior year in high school. Mamma says shes too young, but shes old enough for me! he wailed smugly. And that was apparently okay. After all, the song climbed the charts. And then theres the subtly creepy Ringo Starr singing Youre sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine. But perhaps most disturbing of all is Gary Pucketts skin-crawling Young Girl in which he moans Young girl, get out of my mind. My love for you is way out of line! Better run girl, you're much too young girl! Just how young are we talking Gary? Brrrrr. How was that song a hit in 68? This is almost like listening to Humbert sing of his longing for the vivacious Dolores (Lolita).

Walter does not have the benefit of a hit song like Kip Winger, Ringo Starr or Gary Puckett. But he has certainly taken his share of hits, physical and otherwise. And yet he still cant seem to get away from the children. As The Woodsman progresses we see him begin to hang out across from the school yard  every parents worst nightmare  and eventually to hone in on one young girl. But at the same time he is consumed by guilt and regret and struggling to overcome his impulses. He really wants to have a normal relationship with a woman, but he also has these screaming desires.

Walter is dirty, disgusting, the ultimate social outcast. And without restraint we pour out our hatred and disapprobation upon him. But what if Walter is the lead singer, scrubbed up with spandex and stage make up and he meets the fourteen year old for a brief tryst under the stage? The evil and damage done to the young victim are the same. (Listen to Larry Normans classic song Pardon Me which narrates the emotional toll on the young groupie.)

We seem surprisingly tolerant as a society of the rock star with pedophilic tendencies. (Im sure you remember where you were when you learned that Michael Jackson died.) And it aint just music. What about the advertising of Abercrombie and Fitch, with their push-up bras for eight year olds? And what about Bratz dolls, some in leather, lipstick and diapers? Walters crimes are not excused. But perhaps we should spend more time reflecting on the crimes of the rest of us.

The most important lesson from The Woodsman is that, to put it succinctly, were all crap. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is an important one. (For that matter, so is Steve James 2002 documentary Stevie, a close up look at a pedophile who, incredibly enough, is also somehow a human being.) Anyways, heres how the ever-eloquent Roger Ebert put it:

The Woodsman understands this at the very heart of its being, and that is why it succeeds as more than just the story of this character. It has relevance for members of the audience who would never in any way be even remotely capable of Walters crime. We are quick to forgive our own trespasses, slower to forgive those of others. The challenge of a moral life is to do nothing that needs forgiveness. In that sense, were all out on parole.

It focuses on a person, portrayed by Kevin Bacon, who has been released from prison and is on parole.  His offense is molesting female children.  He meets a woman, Kera Sedgwick, who was sexually molested as a child.  The movie takes Bacon's character through his relationships with police officers, co-workers on the job and his treatment provider.  While I give this movie five stars, I do not recommend it for children and it should come with a warning for those who have been sexually abused as children as it may be difficult for them to watch.",1385164800,,690,4.805084745762712

This movie deals w/ the reality of how he deals w/ his demons and also tries to fit into society once released from prison. Hannah Pilkes plays the role of Robin and does an outstanding job and she is essential to Walter and how he deals w/ his demons and his ever longing desires that most people would find repulsive.

2230482,4,B0007PID84,"THE WOODSMAN is a real tough luck story.

Walter (Kevin Bacon) is a convicted child molestor released on probation after serving 12 years of a life sentence. After returning to his hometown, Walter's rehired at a lumberyard based on a previous good work record there. Even living across the street from a nmiddle school, Walter keeps out of trouble. Things seem to be going well until this overly nosy secretary, played by one-named ""Eva,"" finds out Walter's secret, prints his rap sheet off the internet and hands out copies to everyone at work. ""They have a right to know"" is her justification.

Naturally he becomes the target of threats, violence and in one instance, an act of sabotage that could've seriously injured Walter if he didn't notice the nail driven into a board he was making slices in with a radial arm saw. Enraged, Walter leaves his job after this near incident.

Walter's life isn't totally bleak. He's got a girlfriend (Kyra Sedgwick) who wants Walter to move in with her. Vickie has her own reasons: three older brothers who ""poked"" her (to used the character's words), ""in chronological order."" She just wants to understand what makes guys behave inappropriately with young girls. So perhaps these two complete each other.

He's also keeping an eye on a molester of young boys. An eventual confrontation with this guy is the story's dramatic highlight.

For anyone concerned with the unsavory background of this film's main character, the only genuinely repulsive moment is when Walter has Vickie sit on his lap, just like he did with all those sweet young things in the old days. You get a non-explicit idea of how he pleasured himself-- apparently via auto-eroticism, nothing that involved intimate contact with the child's body. Vickie however, is sickened at the thought that her boyfriend may still be ""that way."" It's an issue they have to immediately sort out.

""The Woodsman"" ultimately makes us sympathetic to the plight of an ex-con trying to put his life straight, a man that going in you'd never imagine caring one whit about. Currently rated 7.3 at IMDb, it co-stars David Alan Grier and Benjamin Bratt.",1342137600,,2140,4.914127423822714
2230483,4,B0007PID84,"Four decades ago, a friend of mine was convicted of child molesting. You'd never guess this guy was a pedophile. He was bright, highly educated in guilt-edge universities, pleasant, personable and well liked. I had known him for seven years, then when I was away for a few months he was busted. It seems he baby-sitted a friend's three children and took incriminating pictures. He had the photos printed at a local photofinisher who summoned the police in. They allowed the photos to be returned as if nothing was wrong and then showed up with a search warrant. It was an open and shut case. I was stunned by the whole thing and would never have guessed, I spoke to him later and he claimed he did nothing wrong and wouldn't harm the children in any way, but that's not what it looked like in the court case. He was convicted and given a strict long-term probation. Later he skipped out of the country and lived the remainder of his life in countries where his acts were not considered criminal.

Al of this past history came to mind last night when I viewed ""The Woodsman"" DVD. It was the story of a child-sex abuser who had been convicted and sent to prison for twelve years. The story begins with his release. Well, of all the different types of criminals we have, the absolute bottom of the pecking order are the convicted pedophiles and they become abused themselves in all sorts of different ways, both in prison and out in the free world. Kevin Bacon depicts the released convict and does a good acting job of it. He finds a second-floor apartment across the street from an elementary school. Hopefully, this could never happen in modern-day California. He gets a job at a large lumber yard. The movie depicts his life and his struggles, There's the tempting children across the street and another pedophile who is scouting out little boys. There's a nice looking 12-year-old girl whom he befriends and she almost agrees to sit on his lap. There's the discovery at work of his prison term and the offense that got it for him. He finds a new and understanding adult girlfriend. Everyone close to him holds him in contempt, including his parole officer to his brother-in-law and sister. It's a tough world for one with his affliction.

It's an interesting movie, perhaps enhanced by my personal knowledge of such a case. The movie was well done and the sight and sound came across well. I didn't feel any upwelling of sympathy for the leading character or his plight. The story was not particularly compelling. I don't think it would be a movie I would watch a second time.

I think they are just seeing the subject knowing its gonna show you something completely different than what you want to think. You not wanting to deal with it and to not feel something for this man cuz of this subject.. It's a touchy subject that is like Taboo that no one likes to talk about but it should be something to be talked about and to understand much better. Definitely not for a movie for a person that don't like to watch anything that is a touchy subject let alone see it in a different way.

He played a role that I think most people wouldn't be able to pull off. I can't think of a person right now that could.

Through the movie he talks about wanting to be normal and to not have those feelings. It seems like he obviously dislikes himself for doing what he did. He is scared to be around other people or getting people close because of knowing what he did and if they are younger girls that he would try to do something with them. and I think its not cuz he would be afraid to end up back in prison because he really doesn't want to hurt them. He seems to know that what he did was wrong but he did it.  I don't know I felt for this guy! I felt like he really wanted to get over this and not to be that person anymore. It gave you a perspective that maybe just maybe that not every person that does a wrongful act are really bad people, just people that have something...in their mind chemistry or whatever that you get the end result.

I liked when they showed another pedophile, when his girl revealed she was abused by her brothers, when he finds out that the girl he was (idk what the word is) when her own dad was molesting her....The girl knew what Kevin Bacons character wanted just because of her dad and when she gave him a hug, idk to me it was like a sense of forgiving to who he was or something...I thought it was so great of Vicki to stick up for this guy who she really likes, I believe if there was no one there for him, he would have ended up back in prison. I wanted to punch Mary-Kay (Eve) for broadcasting it in the workplace, only because he wasn't into her. Really?!?! Jealous much? Sorry hunny not every guy that you are into, is into you, don't mean you should look him up and broadcast his life out like how she did. it showed the perpetrator and the victim, showed feelings, showed stereotypes in this movie

I am against child abuse whether its emotional to the physical or sexually physical but to me this movie showed more than just that and it gave me a perspective of maybe finding out more about the person, to understand..",1318464000,,3490,4.829431438127091

2230486,5,B0007PID84,"The psychologist Bruno Bettelheim wrote in one of his books on fairy tales that another name for the story of Little Red Riding Hood is The Woodsman. Bettelheim said that the fable was suggesting a man abusing a young girl. The wolf symbolizes this kind of man. This is the thought behind this film's title. The film focuses on a convicted sex offender who had abused young girls. It raises the questions: can such a man change and live a ""normal"" life? If yes, how long will it take? What is ""normal""?

 The sex offender lives across the street from a grade school and watches young girls and boys coming and going to and from school. He sees another man watching the children. This man speaks to the kids and offers them candy.

 A woman at work picks him up and the two have sex. She tells him that her three brothers abused her when she was a child, but she now has a good relationship with all three. After a while, he tells her what he had done. They separate, but she comes back. He is being treated by a psychologist. It comes out during the sessions that he and his sister slept together in the same bed from time to time. Now, unlike his girl friend's situation, his sister refuses to forgive him for what he did. He feels that he needs this forgiveness.

 He sees a young girl in the park and is attracted to her. He follows her, sits with her, and asks her to sit on his lap. She tells him that her father did the same. She cries and says that if he still wants her to sit on his lap, she will do so. He says no. At home, sees the man who had been watching the children take a boy and later return with him, and he reacts.

 His psychologist asks him about the tree incidences - his sister, the girl in the park, and the abuser. It will take time to resolve your problem, he says. And he asks, how do you feel about that?",1298592000,,1833,4.15819209039548

It is nothing like you would think it would be considering the subject matter.  Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are fantastic.  At their best.

I brought this film to a counseling group, along with my own personal DVD player.  The film is a bit ""head-spinning"" to some, yet there are several reasons to obtain a copy, or at the very least view this title.",1296518400,,437,4.4625
2230490,2,B0007PID84,"I also think that Kevin Bacon's acting was quite good in this film, but I don't think I agree with what may be a prevailing opinion in the reviews, in regard to Bacon's character. I am seeing many comments about he being a deeply flawed man but still a human being, not a monster, someone who desperately wants to rid himself of his desires, someone who doesn't ""really hurt"" little girls, someone who deserves forgiveness and compassion.

I don't know if Walter was a monster. Just because he didn't act like Candy, in my opinion, didn't make him any less worthy of such a label. I think anyone who hurts children for their own selfish desires is pretty monstrous. I didn't get a sense either of true penitence from him in regard to his crimes. I got the impression that he hated the kind of life he had to lead post prison, but someone who is truly penitent doesn't follow young girls around the mall and certainly doesn't live across the street from an elementary school! How would he even be allowed to do that anyway, with being a sex offender? Also, he said to his girlfriend that he ""never hurt"" them. That statement alone showed that he took  no responsibility for his actions, or felt real remorse, since making a child an object of one's sexual gratification is hurting them, terribly, no matter what one does within that act. Then there was the girl in the park, following her, then making his move on her. I am still not sure about Robin's response to Walter's invitation. Such a request coming from a strange man in the park should have frightened her away quickly. Also it was too convenient that Walter's and the father's MO were similar. I didn't care that Walter finally got it, and don't think he deserves any medals.

Why was Walter's brother in law pushing so hard for him to see his wife, Walter's sister?? Apparently she was severely traumatized, and it didn't seem to matter at all to the brother in law, or to Walter, who after seeing her, just walked away smiling, while she ran away, devastated all over again. I don't know what was with the brother in law. Walter had just gotten out of a 12 year prison term for molesting little girls, he had victimized his own sister when she was young and Walter had to be kept away from his own child, yet he is all buddy buddy and ""wishing he could invite Walter to her birthday party."" Yeah, that's the ticket, a houseful of little girls and Uncle Walter. No problem there. I also wondered what he was thinking to refer to the skimpy type clothes Carla and her friends wore..to a man who offended sexually to that age group! He just didn't get it.

No, I didn't see a penitent praying for redemption. I saw a man pissed at how people treated him, because he ""wasn't bad"" like Candy, or so he thought, therefore not deserving such treatment, while putting himself in places to feed his fantasies, if not his realities.",1294444800,,2884,4.508604206500956
2230491,4,B0007PID84,"I'm going to make this review as straight-forward as possible.  It might be asking to much to hope that most people will judge it based on its content, and not on whether or not they agree with the ratings I've chosen.  It's probably safe to assume that a large number of readers will already know what they think of these films, in which case I'd suggest you read this review to get another's opinion.  If you haven't seen either of these films, however, I guarantee you that you'll have a good idea of which of these movies you'll be most likely to enjoy.

This review will concern two movies -- THE WOODSMAN and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Candy/dp/B000GI3KGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Candy</a>&nbsp;-- both of which focus exclusively on the very thorny, very divisive topic of child molestation/pedophilia.

Before I get into the films themselves, I'd like to make one thing crystal clear: there is nothing funny about child molestation.  It is a horrible crime, and there are no scenarios in which it is acceptable in any way, shape, or form.  As a survivor of child molestation, I have a first-hand understanding of the kinds of repercussions caused by this incredibly heinous act.  And please don't misunderstand.  I do NOT say this to garner pity or sympathy, nor do I seek to represent myself as the voice of all molestation victims everywhere.  Hardly.  It has taken me a long time to get to the point where I can say this with simple acknowledgement, as a way of framing my opinions with a basic and necessary fact that has colored my experiences with love, sex, romance, and relationships my entire life.

My opinion, in a nutshell:  THE WOODSMAN is a good film, because it manages to get the audience to sympathize with the pedophile.  HARD CANDY is a horrible film for the exact same reason.  How can this be?  It's because the first film is about forgiveness and redemption, and the second film is about unadulterated hate and vengeance.  Speaking as someone who use to embrace hate, I can tell you that HARD CANDY's philosophies -- popular and easily digestible though they may be -- are counterproductive and destructive.  Older and wiser now, THE WOODSMAN's philosophies may be much harder to stomach, but they are the way the world is, or rather, should be.

HARD CANDY is a disgusting film.  The talented&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ellen-Page/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ellen Page</a>&nbsp;plays Hayley Stark, a girl who is being pursued by Jeff, our resident pedophile.  After Jeff conives to get Hayley back to his house, it becomes clear that Hayley is not your typical 14-year-old.  From this point on, Hayley tortures Jeff relentlessly while they engage in repetitive and predictable dialogue about his crimes.  Hayley appears to have the wits of a Harvard grad and the strength and agility of a quarterback, because she ensares and releases and ensares Jeff in a series of elaborate torments without breaking a sweat.  This movie is very, very much a revenge fantasy, and that is all it is.

When I was young, and lying in bed, I used to imagine similar fantasies, and all they did was prolong my own recovery process.  I've heard dozens of different explanations for the film's premise and goals, but the end game is this: this movie is obviously about turning the tables.  Unfortunately, when you turn the tables, what you get is a young girl who behaves with the confident viciousness of a child molester, and a child molester who flails about, as confused, hurt, and distraught as a child.  Jeff is a horrible person, which is why I was so disturbed to find myself kind of wishing he would win out over the insufferably pompous and stone-hearted Hayley.  This movie contains no subtlety, no surprises, and nothing beyond its surface level viciousness.

THE WOODSMAN, on the other hand, shows the consequences of such viciousness.  Kevin Bacon plays Walter, a convicted child molester who is desperately trying to be a normal person.  Unlike HARD CANDY's endless rants, this film has very little dialogue, but world's more heart and wisdom.  Walter is a damaged man, but he knows he's damaged, and the movie explores the possibility that people can change, can finally deserve forgiveness.  There are a few very difficult scenes in THE WOODSMAN -- scenes I found myself gritting my teeth at -- but they provided very clear answers.  How can anyone change if they cannot forgive themselves?  And how can anyone forgive themselves if the world refuses to forgive them, too?

As someone who struggled with forgiveness, trust me, I understand the desire to label such people with easy monikers like ""monster"" or ""sicko,"" but I also know that those kinds of labels are just another way of avoiding the agonizing calculus of penance divided by resentment.  Actually, one of the labels I used -- sicko -- is fairly apt, because this film shows how Walter is less a villain who uses his urges to destroy than he is another human being who is destroyed by something he longs to be rid of.  In spite of the film's probative pace, it's quiet stance, the movie feels remarkably short (when it was done, it felt like thirty minutes had passed, instead of ninety), and although I felt like it could have gone into a bit more depth with some of its questions, it did do exactly what it set out to do, no more and no less.

I give HARD CANDY one star, THE WOODSMAN four.  If you're wondering which one you might enjoy, ask yourself the following question: which philosophy do you most agree with...

""An eye for an eye..."" (HARD CANDY)
""...makes the whole world blind.""  (THE WOODSMAN)",1265673600,,5719,4.975789473684211
2230492,4,B0007PID84,"This film is totally atypical, his quality being I think good but not exceptional, made with little means. However that doesn't matter here so much, as the plot is daring and troubling, but with not false nor papier mach heroes as usual in today's cinema.
There are in life effectively, good and bad people, and generally a mixture of both qualities.
But there are also a little amount of people which for unexplainable causes are born with a sort of destiny toward evil or repugnant crimes. And this is the case of Walther, the protagonist played by Kevin Bacon. He's a pedophile or life has driven him until that vice. He fights against his pulsion, but the evil is inside. All this is a question very difficult to understand by the surrounding people, and much more to understand with equality, as for being just, Walther seems not guilty of his impulses although yes of his actions.

Well, we also can reflect about the condition of childhood and traditional family, both are relatively modern concepts in human history, dating surely from the middle of XIX th century and only in Europe and America. In many cultures still today, the crimes and sexuality of Walther surely are considered, if no normal, irrelevant. Summing up, an unpopular and difficult movie.",1263859200,,1265,4.829493087557604
2230493,5,B0007PID84,"Released in 2005, ""The Woodsman"" tells the story of Walter (Kevin Bacon) who's trying to make a life for himself in Philadelphia after spending 12 years in prison due to his abnormal predilection for 10-12 year-old girls. When news gets out of why he was in prison it causes problems with his girlfriend Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick) and at his new job. Walter desperately seeks healing from his condition even while he occasionally flirts with his sick desires. On top of this is Walter's parole officer who doesn't believe he can be trusted in conventional society. Meanwhile Walter spots a pedophile preying on children at the local elementary school. What should he do? And is there any hope for him to escape his condition?

There are two things potential viewers should know up front: Walter is aware of his problem and desires freedom from it; in other words, he's repentant -- he wants to turn from his negative/destructive desires and channel his sexual energy positively and responsibly. Secondly, it becomes clear that Walter is not guilty of raping any girls but rather molesting them by getting his jollies with them on his lap (fully clothed). Yes, it's still bad, but not as bad as raping or killing. These are important points that help the viewer have compassion on Walter and root for his success in the story (because if he was unrepentant and guilty of actually raping or killing girls then please fry his butt and get it over with -- or, at least, lock him up and throw away the key).

As noted in the title blurb, the film is a dramatic psychological study. It spotlights the classic struggle of flesh & spirit or id & ego. It's dialogue-driven and plot-driven rather than action-driven or cgi-driven. In other words, this is a thinking-person's film. Needless to say, uber-fans of conventional blockbusters should stay away.

In a way, Walter's struggle is universal and most of us can relate to it on one level or another. For example. We may not have a predilection for tweenage girls but we might struggle with other negative tendencies, like alcoholism, drugs, adultery, fits of rage, porn addiction, gluttony, sloth, depression, lying, etc. The film subtly makes it clear that without love & belief there's little hope of spiritual metamorphosis.

(MINOR SPOILER: The next two paragraphs explore one of the main insights of the story and comments on one important scene)

One of the main points of the film is distinguishing a repentant pedophile from a non-repentant one. Walter has come to a place where he understands that his pedophile desires are of his flesh (i.e. id or destructive carnal nature) and should not be embraced, fed and acted upon (although, again, he flirts with the idea on a couple occasions). Walter KNOWS that to take advantage of young girls and have sexual relations with them is wrong, and is trying to walk free of such desires. This is contrasted by the predatory pedophile who hangs out by the school preying on kids. This guy obviously embraces, feeds and acts on his pedophile desires. There's a big difference between these two. The attitude of the heart makes all the difference. Walter deserves a second chance because he's repentant and trying to change for the positive, even while he should be monitered closely; the other guy, on the other hand, has totally given himself over to his perverted desires and deserves the snot beat out of him (at the very least).

One critic argues that it's not realistic that a 45 year-old guy sits on a bench in the park and a cute 11 year-old girl sits herself next to him and asks, ""How's the view?"" But, wait a second, Walter had previously met the girl so she was already familiar with him; he didn't hurt her before, why would he hurt her now? Besides, the girl comes from a dysfunctional home where she suffers molestation from her dad; hence, it's not likely that she has the best understanding and discretion concerning social situations, not to mention her inner need and compulsion for masculine love and attention (since she's not getting it from her father). In addition, Walter was obviously drawn to and comfortable around little girls, which helped make the girl feel safe around him.

(END SPOILER)

Another criticism is that the film is melancholy and plays out in a flat manner. This is true but don't you think a bit o' melancholy fits the subject matter? As for the story being flat, the filmmakers (Nichole Kassell and Steven Fechter) were obviously shooting for realism. Isn't real life kind of flat? Personally I prefer realism over the goofiness, overkill action/cgi and generally unbelievable tone of many modern pictures.

The film was shot on location in Philadelphia and runs a short-but-sweet 87 minutes.

Interesting tidbit: Kevin Bacon and co-star Kyra Sedgwick have been married since 1988 and have 2 children.

FINAL ANALYSIS: As long as you can handle the subject matter and a couple of cringe-inducing spots, ""The Woodsman"" is outstanding if you're in the mood for a serious drama or psychological study.

P.S. Be sure to catch the delelted scene of Walter and Robin's discussion at the bench. The fuller version should never have been deleted; you'll see why when you compare the sequences.",1253145600,,5220,4.865990990990991

But, I have to say that it was absolutely terrific.

I think most pedophiles are NOT sorry. They don't care about or empathize with their victims at all. Many are actual or borderline sociopaths. But, Kevin Bacon portrays the minority. A pedophile who actually wants to change.

During one scene where he is talking to a little girl in the woods, I actually found myself holding my breath and then breathing out ""Don't do it. Don't do it.""

Yes, this movie had me talking out loud to the main character.

I guess my only real fault with the film was Bacon's new 'girlfriend'. As much as I felt for the character, there is no way in real life that I would knowingly consort with a pedophile.

Overall:

An excellent film with an astounding performance by Bacon.",1246406400,,934,4.458823529411765
2230495,4,B0007PID84,"Child molesters are at the lowest rung of the prison hierarchy and when they get out, they are at the lowest rung of the general population.  Kevin Bacon's character (Walter) is a man who served time in prison for this.  The story focuses on his life outside... his inner turmoil and the problems others have with him and how he deals with it.  He seldom gets a reprieve in the whole film.  There's not a moment in the film where he doesn't have a somber and serious look on his face with one exception.  Regardless of how much we hate child molesters, this film makes us understand their struggles more and actually root for the man to turn his life around.  Though sadly, it's something that he always has to deal with.  Child molestors are often products of some type of childhood trauma themselves, so their unusual drives and inclinations are ""hard wired"" into their brains.  The film makes it clear that they have a long hard road ahead of them.  Dealing with their inner conflict and at the same time having to deal with people who abhor them.",1214265600,,1050,4.5132275132275135

2230497,3,B0007PID84,"With Kevin Bacon as a recovering pedophile, it's refreshing to see everyone's favorite ""boogeyman"" get a makeover and allowed ordinary human feelings, audience sympathy, and even, sort of, a happy ending. No doubt lots of people were incensed by the movie and considered it immoral because it evoked sympathy for someone who likes to have sex with pubescent girls (and even pre-pubescent, the character stipulates 10 to 12-year-olds). But it does an admirable job of telling its story first (which is really a character study, made effective by Bacon's soulful and moving performance), and making its points second. The points it makes, predictably enough, center around tolerance and compassion, and the film shows pretty persuasively how regular folk's fear and loathing of ""pedophilia"" (and the denial of their own propensity for it) only make the whole sticky problem worse, by refusing to even entertain the possibility of understanding.

The film dramatically illustrates the inevitable tension between the deviant and the society that rejects him, and how that tension itself gives rise to further deviance. It's the oldest folly of all, the demonization of the other in order to project all our own unacknowledged neuroses, fears, and desires onto them. But oh, it's convenient! The result is that what we fear and loath inevitably becomes more and more fearsome and loathsome the more we deny it and refuse to understand it. Because without understanding, there is no possibility of acceptance, which is the necessary prerequisite for change. If we only forgive the sinner once he has repented, what's so admirable about that? Especially when we refuse to afford him our trust and compassion and sympathy and belief that he CAN change.

How is the sinner ever to repent, if he can't first be forgiven, and forgive himself? All that self-hatred and the unbearable sense of being different, alienated, from others is what leads to the deviant's neurotic drives to begin with. So it can easily be seen how society's response to the ""problem"" (a problem which, after all, IT created), only exacerbates the problem further. God how I despise moralists!
""Morality is the root of all evil"" - if I may be permitted to quote myself. (Matrix Warrior. Hey, it's my dime, man!)

The Woodsman is a slight, and apart from it subject matter, fairly conventional film.

Kevin Bacon could not have tackled and been more accomplished as his portrayal of Walter, a convicted pedophile who is mainstreamed back into society after a twelve year incarceration. It is not easy to say the least. What makes this film work so beautifully is that Kyra Sedgwick,Bacon's real life wife, plays Vicki,the woman with which Walter finds solace and sympathy. The chemistry and extreme dedication to make this subject work is obvious between the two actors. Bacon and Sedgwick do it. There will not be one single interpretation of this controversial film. Hopefully this film allows the offender to be viewed in both a sympathetic and still cautionary way. Trust me, Walter is in danger of ""slipping up"" at any moment. This is what makes this film tense. I saw this one in it's very limited release in the theater, and it is even more enjoyable on DVD.This would be an excellent film for open-minded,thinking people to watch and discuss.

2230499,5,B0007PID84,"Never has a drama thumped me at the core as this one. The movie was more real than anything else portrayed about this issue yet as wonderfully done as if it were an  greatest artist's fiction.
An irony...all the story and characters in this movie were fiction. However, this film shows more truth and reality about the pedophile than the so called reality series, To Catch A Predator.
I think this fact has mostly to do with those portrayed on that series are not one in the same as Kevin Bacon's character. Bacon's character portrays one of society's most common yet misunderstood issues, the American pedophile. To Catch a Predator portrays lonely, STUPID, low life men who aren't popular with the ladies and would rather meet a virgin online than allow their cheap selves to buy hookers or risk HIV. Seriously, think about it. They don't call it perverted justice for nothing.
Back to the film.  The Woodsman is to pedophile as to The Beautiful Mind is to Schizophrenia. After seeing The Beautiful Mind with Russell Crow, a person with schizophrenia became more than just the insane, screaming, possessed village idiot in our minds. He became human.
In the Woodsman the pedophile became more than just a lusting creepy devil posted on your state's web site. He became human.
Kevin Bacon's character demanded and forced us to share his soul with his. To make us feel as he felt and suffer as he did.
There are so many great scenes in the movie. My favorite three:
When the police sergeant tearfully complains that this world is without Woodsmen. The scene begged our society, asking, how can we live ourselves knowing that we live in a world where there are men who can commit such evil to children?
The other scene I loved was towards the end. He is with the girl alone in the park and he begins to give in to his desires. She is happy with him and he honestly believes she will enjoy sexual advances. Yet, when he sees in her eyes and tremble from all the pain her Father caused her, he resolves to not do the same. It seemed that the love he felt was stronger than his desire to take advantage of her, it showed the separation between him and true monsters out there...a destination few in society recognize. He showed that in spite of his criminal record, he of all people was a, ""Woodsman.""
And of course, he took this realization to the next level in my third favorite scene. He trashed and beat the Candyman character to a pulp and that action ultimately led to that creep being arrested for previous exploits against children.
The Woodsman forced and made us understand that not all pedophiles fit the class of the sterotype and that those who actually do harm children are in a class of their own. The movie helped make sense a very dark issue, that the majority of pedophiles evidently suffer the same emotions, feelings, and conflicts that alcoholics, drug abusers, or even what homo sexuals go through in conservative communities.
It is a beautiful and sad movie. That such a film did not win an Oscar gives the most creditable evidence that the academy is ruled by politics rather than artistic distinction
props to Mr. Bacon and the writers of The Woodsman.",1193702400,,3173,4.644128113879003
2230500,4,B0007PID84,"I know I'm not the first, or the best, to say this, but these days we don't take sin seriously.  Sometimes we laugh at it, and even think it makes a person more interesting.  Most of the time we excuse it away or call it a ""mistake,""  like burning the cookies.  Mostly we just forget about it - to the point that thinking about past sin has come to be considered unhealthy.

There is a scene in the Woodsman where Kyra Sedgewick and Kevin Bacon are lying in bed.  She knows he has a ""deep dark secret"" (see? we can't even say that without a smirk) that he won't tell her, and she's dying to know what it is.  ""What's the worst thing you've ever done?""  he asks her.  And she tells him, and it's pretty bad and she still feels pretty bad about it, but she knows it won't change the way he thinks about her.  But then, it's his turn.

And here's the thing:  he has committed the one sin that we, as a society, still take seriously.  He molested little girls.  He deeply regrets doing it, he has served twelve years in prison for it, and he's desperate to never do it again.  But when he tells her, he knows that it will change the way she thinks about him.  He gets up and holds the door open for her, and she leaves.  Because this is a sin that does not go away.

What makes this a fascinating movie to watch, and one to remember, is that it is a portrait of a man grappling with his sin, both the sin he has committed, the sin he now knows he's capable of, the sin that disgusts him, and the sin he is still tempted to commit.  Perhaps if we really had the mind of Christ, we would see all of our sin the way this character (Walter) sees his.  ""When will I be normal?""  he asks his therapist.  ""What is normal?""  the therapist replies.  ""Normal is being able to look at a girl and not think...""  he never finished the sentence, and he doesn't have to.  Normal is to live without temptation.

Roger Ebert wrote in his review,
""It is not the pedophile that is evil, but the pedophilia. That is true of all sins and crimes and those tempted to perform them: It is not that we are capable of transgression that condemns us, but that we are willing. ""The Woodsman"" understands this at the very heart of its being, and that is why it succeeds as more than just the story of this character. It has relevance for members of the audience who would never in any way be even remotely capable of Walter's crime. We are quick to forgive our own trespasses, slower to forgive those of others. The challenge of a moral life is to do nothing that needs forgiveness.  In that sense, we're all out on parole.""

2230501,4,B0007PID84,"Some subjects are so taboo that even if done in an artful way it is hard for us to swallow or be entertained by.  We have run into subjects like these in films about things such as slavery, the holocaust, films about rape and in recent year's films about 9-11. Most of these subjects have a percentage of the public turned off  and the other percentage able to disconnect, for whatever reason, and able to view the film in a subjective manner.  The Woodsman deals with the toughest subject matter of any film I've seen, they make the main character in the film a child molester and have us try to feel sorry for him.  This film right off the bat had me saying to myself that this was an impossible task.

I was half right, I didn't feel sorry for Walter played wonderfully by Kevin Bacon, at times I understood why everyone hated him.  What I also learned was the other side of his life.  Him wanting to be normal and constant wondering if he would ever be able to find peace within himself.  This film was beautifully directed by new comer Nicole Kassell who directed this story with kid gloves and certainly a scene of tastefulness and discipline needed for such a risky script.

You will not cheer for the Kevin Bacon's character and you probably won't feel sorry for him, but you'll try to understand how hard his life is and wish he could do something to change it.  I can't recommend this film to everyone, I know as a parent it was hard for me to watch and think that there are people like this out there.  If you do watch this know that it's a good movie with great acting and that the director tip toes around this taboo without crossing over into distastefulness for the sake of ""art"".  It's a shame that these performances will not be seen by many because I think this film is a good one, a very good one.  The only thing that it didn't change is my feeling for people like this, I don't want them around me or my children but I do respect the ones that acknowledge they have a problem and seek help to correct it.",1189900800,,2025,4.2973684210526315
2230502,4,B0007PID84,"Writer/Director Nicole Kassell has fashioned and brought to life a taut, gritty adaptation of Steven Fechter's play.  There's great acting in this small-budget winner.  Kevin Bacon turns in one of his best performances here.  It's fascinating to watch him act with real-life spouse Kyra Sedgwick - Sedgwick's is a juicy blue-collar role that she plays to the hilt...deliciously.  Also good in a smaller role is the always underrated Benjamin Bratt.  This guy brings likability and a sense of ease to whatever he does.  There's a pivotal moment in the film where Bratt's character (he's the brother-in-law to Bacon's deeply troubled character) has to react and break from his till-then friendly interactions with Bacon.  It's one of the film's pivotal scenes.  Great stuff from Ben Bratt.

2230504,5,B0007PID84,"Not until the final sentence or two of this film does The Woodsman reach anything like dramatic resolution, and even then it is a resolution of the sort befitting the deep complexity and ambiguity of its subject matter. The film begins when Walter is released from serving 12 years in prison for his conviction as a sex offender, and he tries to make a new life for himself. He takes an apartment across the street from an elementary school (yes, a bad choice), and rides the bus to his job at a lumber yard. Except for his therapist, all those outside of and around Walter ostracize him as a monster and a freak. His sister refuses to talk to him or allow him to see his niece, a detective monitors his every move, and when his work colleagues discover his past they ""out"" him in a most bizarre way. Within himself another war rages. Neither Walter nor the viewer really knows to what extent he has moved beyond his past and is, therefore, safe. Involuntary hallucinations plague him, and poor choices born of habit implicate him. Three important sub-plots, all revolving around child molestation, contribute to Walter's unfolding narrative. Watching this film I was reminded of Faulkner's unnerving observation that ""the past isn't gone; it isn't even past."" Still, and not to reveal too much, this incredibly tense and powerful film ends on a hopeful note that is nevertheless sobering for all of us who seek redemption this side of eternity.",1169596800,,1445,4.760956175298805

2230506,4,B0007PID84,"This is one of those small movies that comes out with a very intriguing cast.  Most notable, of course, is Kevin Bacon, who has been showing us since _Murder in the First_ that he is quite a capable actor and is likely to show up just anywhere...and his appearance here does not quash that image at all.  Kyra Sedgewick also stars, as well as Benjamin Bratt.  But there are also other recognizable names--Eve, David Alan Grier and Mos Def--though these are a surprise for showing up in a film that is so serious and a little dark as well.  They are also a surprise for how competent they are.

_The Woodsman_ focuses on Walter (Kevin Bacon), a released child molester out to move onward with his life.  He gets a job at a lumber yard and quickly stirs interest in how withdrawn he is, how damaged.  Kyra Sedgewick is a co-worker who develops an interest for Walter, maybe partly attracted to the fact that he is 'damaged goods.'

But of course, life on the outside isn't easy for Walter.  Though he has a tight relationship with his brother-in-law (Benjamin Bratt), his sister and neice do not want to have any contact with him, and a detective (Mos Def) is keeping a close eye on every move he makes.  Walter, of course, has his own struggles, for he knows how likely his type is to repeat offend, and in his thinking he had 'never harmed' any of his victims.  Also, he lives across the street from an elementary school, so temptation presents itself regularly.

The film itself is a good study of the struggles of this character to move onward with his life, though there are plenty of incentives, both interior and exterior, to give up any impulse to change.  Kevin Bacon is wonderfully reticent though not emotionless, presenting well a tortured soul still trying to determine what is right and wrong.  In the course of this movie, we find out that many characters are damaged in many ways, making the issue of the film not an investigation of who is damaged, but how people sort out the damage in their own lives.  Even Mos Def's character, who may seem a little belligerent and bordering on persecutorial at first, only wants to end pain in the world.

The ending of _The Woodsman_ is a little too well wrapped-up and feels a little easy, but the rest of the film is a thorough study of characters who feel very fleshed-out and actual.  They don't always make the best decisions, but that is what makes them so sympathetic.  Most of all, it is clear that the casting for this film was extraordinary, as well as the directing--the act of making a child molester a sympathetic character is challenging, and this film pulls this off well.",1163462400,,2641,4.559322033898305
2230507,4,B0007PID84,"Kevin Bacon stars in ""The Woodsman"", a film that gives the viewer a glimpse into the mind of a former child molestor.

Kevin Bacon plays an ex-con, a man who was given twelve years in prison for some very inappropriate behavior with young girls. Because of his actions, he's lost all but two real friends, one, a relative, who sticks by him because the ex-con stuck by him in a time of need, and the other, a woman who is in love with the ex-con, who loves him for who he is, his sense of humour, his personality. Just out, he's gotten himself a job doing woodwork, and frequently goes to his counsellor, all the while trying to come to terms with what he's done, what he feels, and where he's going now.

It's a very quiet, very serious film, one that I thought (by the look of it and the way it was filmed) was a lot older than it actually was. I wouldn't call the treatment of Kevin Bacon's character sympathetic, not exactly, but you do get a good idea of what it must feel to be a person like that, having strange feelings you don't want, with everyone who knows about your past disgusted and avoidant when all you want to do is move on. Kevin Bacon does a very good job at potraying all this, probably the best acting I've seen him do.

The amazon rating system is all about how much you liked a product. I'm giving it 4 stars, not because I ""liked"" what I saw (some of it was hard to watch, especially the conversation between Kevin Bacon's character and Robin, the birdwatching girl molested by her father at home, in the park), but because I thought it was an interesting insight.

2230510,5,B0007PID84,"The most memorable role during 2005 was Bacon's,'Woodsman' for which both director Kassell and Sedgwick deserve massive praise. Pedophilia is hardly box-office credentialed fare, and that Bacon's brilliantly nuanced acting can transcend such an unpalatable condition galvanizes our sympathies. Bacon/'Walter' is rehabilitated in a dowdy flat opposite a schoolyard and so recidivist temptation is at his door from the  moment of release into mainstream. His therapist gets him to reluctantly keep a diary. His lover, Sedgwick,a boyish forklift driver at the timber yard where he's been offered work, is a sympathetic, fellow-traveller. And parole cop, the slightly built but cockily perspicacious, Mos Def taunts him with the parable of the woodsman in Red Riding Hood. Mos Def's fondling of the cherrywood table Walter has fashioned, seethes with lethal intent. As his analyst suggests, the merry-go-round Walter feels he's riding, gives him a chance to revisit former behaviour and see something he'd missed on an earlier circuit. Betweeen Sedgwick's coaxing acceptance, Mos Def's simmering loathing, and workplace harassment, Walter hurries back to the woods and a re-encounter with Little Red Riding Hood. It's a few minutes of knock-out cinema, a truly transformative event, bearing the entire weight of the film. The pale weather of the film, not quite bleak but asking for warmth, is perfect.

2230512,5,B0007PID84,"This film deals with an unusual topic, as it sneaks a peek into the life of a pedophile. The pedophile in question is Walter (Kevin Bacon), who returns home to try and re-build his life, after spending twelve years in prison for his unspeakable acts involving young girls. Shunned by his community, former friends, and family, with the exception of his affable brother-in-law, Carlos (Benjamin Bratt), Walter's re-entry into society is one that is solitary and bereft of all that makes life worth living.

He secures an apartment right across from a grammar school, because that landlord is the only one in town who will rent to him. Walter goes to work in a lumber yard, where he works for the fair-minded Bob (David Alan Grier). There, Walter meets Bob's attractive secretary, Eve (Mary-Kay), who apparently has the hots for him, but whose initially friendly overtures Walter rebuffs. His eye is drawn to the feisty Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick), a seemingly tough, hard living gal with secrets of her own.

When Vicki and Walter hook up and get better acquainted, Eve takes their pairing hard and makes it her business to find out more about Walter's past. Meanwhile, Walter and Vicki are becoming an item, and when she finally gets him to reveal something of his past, she is initially aghast to discover that he is a convicted pedophile. Walter reacts to her shock by cutting her off, physically and emotionally .

When Eve discovers a treasure trove of information about Walter's past, she shares it with her co-workers. This causes Vicki to come to his defense, and they are eventually reunited. While all this is going on, there are a variety of subplots that further reinforce Walter's isolation and underscore his attempts at living a normal life. He is mandated to visit a therapist as a condition of his release from prison, and it is there that the viewer gets a birds-eye view into why Walter may have the problem that he has.

Walter is undeniably attracted to young girls, and the viewer sees him conflicted by his compulsion. Brief and subtle flashbacks to those events that eventually saw him imprisoned further draw the viewer into Walter's personal demons. The viewer even sees Walter occasionally giving into that seemingly irresistible compulsion, only to see him pull back before it takes him to the brink of no return, his quest for normalcy always at odds with his seemingly innate proclivity. The scene in the park with eleven year old Robin (Hannah Pilkes) is a chilling one, as it seems as if Walter will be unable to control his compulsion, only to be brought up short by an unexpected revelation.

Meanwhile, Walter is eager to mend bridges with his estranged sister, Annette, who, with her husband, Carlos, has a twelve year old daughter. Annette, however, is far from eager to do so and makes her dislike and mistrust of her pedophile brother evident in a number of ways. Meanwhile, a certain Sgt. Lukas (Mos Def) is keeping tabs on Walter, making sure that he makes Walter feels as low as the regard in which he holds him.

All of this serves to create a fascinating portrait of a pedophile. Kevin Bacon gives a stellar, award-worthy performance that certainly merits recognition. It is simply a stunning, tightly controlled performance, and one that will keep the viewer spellbound. If ever there were a performance that was worthy of an Academy Award, it is this performance by Kevin Bacon, which is a career best. It is a shame that it was entirely disregarded by the Academy.

Bacon's real life wife, Kyra Sedgwick, likewise gives a performance that is three dimensional and compelling in the role of Vicki, the woman who was able to see some good in this convicted pedophile. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent in their respective roles. Kudos must also go to first time director Nicole Russell, who makes her debut with this feature film, exhibiting a certain mastery and deftness for one so young. She also wrote this well-nuanced, metaphoric, and intelligent script. This is a film that deserves to be in one's personal collection.",1150848000,,4079,4.843615494978479
2230513,5,B0007PID84,"It is a brave actor indeed who takes on the role of a paedophile, given the revulsion with which child molesters are generally (and justifiably) viewed by society. To attempt to invest the role with some humanity, in my view, requires courage beyond belief.

Kevin Bacon, one of Hollywood's more underappreciated talents, manages to pull it off though in this dark, disturbing tale of a convicted child molester trying to put his past behind him after release from a 12-year bid.

The movie seems to take no particular position on paedophilia and just looks on unblinkingly while Bacon, who plays Walter, struggles unsuccessfully to fight his demons. We are offered no explanation as to how he turned out the way he is and there is no resolution or redemption before the end credits begin to roll. Walter does manage to find love in the arms of the lovely Vicke, played by Kyra Sedgwick but this offers no solace. He still has the feelings he has and, as an encounter with a little girl in the park clearly demonstrates, he is still a danger to children. This makes the movie uncomfortable to watch but it's so intelligent and compelling at the same time, we dare not take our eyes away.

There is brilliant support from Benjamin Bratt who plays Walter's brother-in-law. His wife, i.e. Walter's sister refuses to see him outright and it's clear to see the man's loyalties are torn. He tries to be supportive to Walter though, and is even prepared to sit down and have a beer with him but isn't prepared to have him at his home and definitely isn't prepared to have him in contact with his daughter. I guess loyalty only can go so far.

But the movie was made for me personally by Mos Def, who gives an astounding performance as a suspicious local detective who keeps a wary eye on Walter. Mos exudes a cool, restrained menace that just proves what a good actor he is. Even though the detective he plays treats Walter with humanity, even politeness, you can also see his utter contempt for what Walter stands for and you imagine him itching for an excuse to be able to go for his gun and put a bullet into Walter's head, putting him out of his misery while making the neighbourhood a safer place at the same time. I often wonder what would've happened if Mos hadn't taken the detour into hip hop and had focused on his acting career instead. (I knew him as an actor on ""The Cosby Mysteries"" before I knew about his rapping). He's definitely a much better actor than many of the rappers turned actors who have successful movie careers right now - DMX, LL Cool J, Queen Latifah, Ice Cube. I'm hoping maybe now he figures it's time to go for it.

Speaking of rappers, Eve also makes an appearance (with black hair, no less!) and puts in a good performance, as the girl who believes the neighbourhood has the right to know there's a child molester in their midst.

Due to its subject matter this movie does leave a strange taste in the mouth but as a piece of art it is not only brave, it is utterly faultless. A stunning debut for the director, Nicole Kassell.",1150502400,,3056,4.517179023508137
2230514,5,B0007PID84,"This film honestly explores tough, taboo subjects. Lee Daniels, the producer, is one brave guy for making this film, a more impressive and nuanced follow-up to Monster's Ball. I watched it with serious trepidation, as I have a little too much personal experience on the victim end of things. But as a practicing Christian, I sensed that my predjudices against ""the scum of the earth who should all be shot to remove them from the gene pool"" wasn't exactly what Jesus seems to be saying all through the Gospel. I watched this movie to see if I could believe that one of these monsters could be redeemed.

Walter is a statistical anamoly. The liklihood of recidivism is extremely high for any convicted felon but for a sexual predator it is nearly impossible to stay out of the system once lawfully released back into society. The difference in his story is grace.

The most unlikely and rare portion of this story is that a criminal is honest about his very hideous crimes and receives unconditional love. That is not our society's way. As the movie so clearly elucidates, sexual predators will never be safe regardless of their state of rehabilitation. We banish them to isolation in many ways, not the least of which is making their sexual crime record public on the internet.

He tries and tries and tries not to do it again. The temptations are everywhere, as girls are everywhere. In this movie, the costume designers don't even bother to dress the girls the way girls really dress, so provacatively, like little sexy women. In this movie, we avoid the trap of that whole discussion and focus on this man's challenge in facing his own demons. The reality is that he doesn't need revealing clothing to be attracted to 10 year olds. His illness started long before he knew what porn was.

The most amazing scene must be viewed. I won't give it away, as I honestly believe everyone should see movies that confront our hatred and prejudices. There is a moment where a would-be victim shows Walter who and what he is, as God would, and there in the face of God is the possibility of real redemption... and real rehabilitation.

There is not a single religious conversation in the movie, don't worry. (There is a church in the background at one point, and that's as far as it goes.) My interpretation is based on my belief that God is everywhere and in everything, and now, in my belief that everyone can be and is saved by the grace of God.",1146787200,,2439,4.6235565819861435
2230515,3,B0007PID84,"If you go to this movie expecting to find a telling drama about the hyprocisy and sheer hysteria that often surrounds our prosecution of child molesters - you will be disappointed. This movie does not tackle the big questions about the cause and effect of pedophilia. I am not sure what The Woodsman hoped to achieve, other than to perhaps humanize a child molester a little by giving him a biography and a life after his release from prison.

However the life that this movie assigns to Kevin Bacon's character is a highly improbable one. He is settled across from a school, acquires a beautiful girlfriend, and most unlikely of all - finds child molestation to be almost ubiquitous around him. The majority of male figures who come on the scene prove to be actual or potential molesters. There is the man Kevin Bacon can see from his window, luring children into a car. There's Kevin Bacon's brother-in-law, who has to be confronted with the fact that his ""love"" for his daughter may be going too far. Finally, the girl whom Bacon approaches in the park turns out to be only too accustomed to such approaches, apparently having had experience with subtle progressions of familiarity from her own father.

Is the movie's point that all men are just a hair's breadth away from molesting? I don't think that was the intention, but that's about the only conclusion the movie leaves us with. It's a well-acted, but ultimately pointless exercise. The producers of The Woodsman took a brave first step in even venturing into this territory. Portraying a pedophile as anything other than a stereotypic ""sicko, pervert"" is not a popular move. However, The Woodsman missed its chance to say something really important about the kind of person who molests children, and mostly, about our reactions to such a person.",1145318400,,1806,4.841423948220065
2230516,5,B0007PID84,"In a year when the big controversy was over ""Brokeback Mountain"" and the courage of the actors and filmmaker, another movie was released that truly was controversial and contained one of the bravest and most disturbing performances of the year. The subject of pedophelia is seldom dealt with, and when it is, the perpetrator is usually portrayed as an evil sicko. ""The Woodsman"" follows the life of a released pedophile (Kevin Bacon), and though he is sick the movie never really passes any judgement and simply lets the viewer in on his mundane life and his attempts at intimacy, normalcy and rehabitulation.
Kevin Bacon has been extremely effective in quite a few movies; ""The Stir of Echoes"", ""Murder in the First"" and ""JFK"", but never has his thin pursed lips and blank expression been used so effectively. He sometimes appears like a walking time-bomb and maybe that's what it's like to not be in control of one's obsessions, and you wonder if he is.
His crimes are never really explained but his habit of following young girls and his discussions with his shrink fill in some gaps. Kyra Sedgwick is excellent as his tough girlfriend, who has some secrets of her own, and the rest of the cast is uniformally good, particularly Mos Def (his parole officer), who somehow manages to be compassionate despite his understandable disgust.
The movie is not for every taste and there is one squirm inducing scene, but its' view of humanity and the struggles of people to hang on to it is quite rewarding.
Kevin Bacon can be an intense actor, but I'm beginning to miss his lighter comedic side. He's got such a winning smile but appropriately, in this movie, it only emerges when he appears the most comfortable, and that's when he's talking to a lonely young girl.",1144972800,,1761,4.777049180327869
2230517,5,B0007PID84,"I rented this because Kevin Bacon does villains so well.  Here again, he produces an incredibly difficult character--one that had to be emotionally draining, and, quite frankly, a risky career move.  Yet he did it--and I believed it.  Walter comes across as an ex-con, freshly out of the system, but still tied to it.  Even his clothing and ""industrial"" style sheets were right.  His body language, gestures, simple, yet deeply thought out speech patterns--perfect!

The plot was superb as well.  Enough was left to conjecture, that I became deeply engrossed.  This story could have actually happened--anywhere!  The scene with Walter and the 11-year old in the park was so frightening in its plausibility, and so powerful in its delivery--all I can say is WOW--I'm still amazed.

BTW, this film is hardly sympathetic towards pedaphilia and those who engage in it.  It's not a mere case study of a sex offender.  The Woodsman forces us to take a look at ourselves, our children, our society in ways that are sometimes frightening, but yet seeded with hope.

A final comment--the DVD has an extended version of some scenes, included Walter with Robin in the park.  If you finish the movie, and absolutely need a more positive spin, view the extended version.  It is sweeter.  On the other hand, the producer's did well to leave it out of the theater version--much better to let the audience ruminate over that scene!

Bottom-line:  This is a stellar production about a wrenching subject.  I have three little girls, which made the dramatic effects all the more gripping.  BTW, my wife also found the film compelling--a true testament, considering the subject matter.",1144540800,,1665,4.985454545454545
2230518,5,B0007PID84,"By treating them like adults, able to witness unsentimental reality with open eyes and minds, this film pays viewers the ultimate compliment.  The Woodsman is a searing character study certain to prompt serious, troubling, and important questions.  Unlike so many movies that treat sexuality, even grotesque sexuality, like a commodity, tinsel to be casually strewn about the set, there is absolutely nothing sexual about The Woodsman.  It is one man's tale, told calmly, deliberately, and without prejudice.

The director, Nicole Kassell, does not invite sympathy or contempt; she simply lets Walter's life unfold through a series of small, carefully constructed scenes, each giving way to the next with the minimalist precision of a play.  Newly out of prison, having served his sentence for a crime involving pedophilia, Walter is now faced with the unimaginably difficult challenge of finding a way back into society.  Bacon is a consistently workmanlike actor who is never bad, usually good, and almost never great.  (His porcine nose, ironically appropriate considering his name, makes him inappropriate for leading man roles reliant on good looks.)  However, The Woodsman finds Bacon delivering the performance of a lifetime, made palpable because his craft is almost completely invisible.

All of Walter's rage, self-loathing, fear of the outside world, fear of himself, shame, pain, regret, and sorrow boil beneath his desperately controlled persona, deceptively shy and laconic.  Vickie, real life wife Kyra Sedgwick, is excellent as the one person who slips through the veneer and touches this damaged, and damaging, human soul.  Mos Def is equally on point as Walter's parole officer, casually expressing the contempt every viewer feels, inviting us to speculate just how vigorously we might express that contempt.

That Walter vents his self-hatred by acting out and terrorizing another of his kind, that his secret is discovered at work leading to cruel repercussions, that he must face his inner darkness once more (in the movie's most heartbreaking and spellbinding scene); these are merely plot points.  There's very little story here, very little action, not even much in the way of resolution.  What there is in its place is genius, on so many levels.  Script, acting, directing, even cinematography.

The Woodsman is a blunt and quiet picture about a difficult subject relayed with an austere sensibility.  This is what movie making could be - if movies were made by adults, for adults.  Highly recommended.",1142985600,,2527,5.3544303797468356

  my quibble and i think it's a big one is - how would society, the parole board or whatever the agencies that would be involved are allow a convicted pedophile to live across the street (and i do mean close !!!) to a grade school with small children ??? where i live released pedophiles are watched and monitored like a hawk. i don't care how hard he says it was to find an apartment. the dept. of corrections or whatever agency would never let him live where he lives.

2230520,4,B0007PID84,"Walter is free from prison after spending 12 years serving time for child molestation, but he is anything but free. He's able to find work in a lumber yard, but when a suspicious co-worker digs into his past, his co-workers quickly turn hostile. A local cop routinely stops by his apartment just to threaten and belittle him, and remind him that he's constantly being watched. Worst of all, now that he's back out in the real world, Walter finds himself gazing longingly at the young girls he's so attracted to.

When a sexually aggressive but warm co-worker, Vickie, enters his life, Walter seems to have a chance at a real adult relationship. Although her acceptance of his past seems unbelievable at first, Vickie reveals her own dark secrets and perhaps her attraction to Walter starts to make a little more sense. However, despite his relationship with Vicki offering a glimmer of hope, Walter still finds himself drawn to a lonely young girl he sees bird watching in the park, which leads to the film's extremely tense, uncomfortable but ultimately redemptive climax.

""The Woodsman"" is a fictitious (as far as I know) film that puts a sympathetic, human face on pedophilia, as the documentary ""Capturing the Freidmans"" did. ""The Woodsman"", however, although filled with plenty of bleak and painful moments, offers its main character hope for redemption and perhaps even a shot at some happiness.

2230522,5,B0007PID84,"I'd been in two minds about seeing this film for some time. It's subject matter, putting aside it's moral dimensions for a moment, could be unsavoury and faintly expoitative if handled by a director or actors who lack insight, depth and intelligence. Finally I took the plunge and I'm extremely glad I did becuase The Woodsman is a finely crafted minor work of cinematic art, that shows real devotion on the part of both it's director and Kevin Bacon (who stars and is also Executive Producer. I can imagine the difficulty he must have had to get a film like this financed). Bacon himself is a revelation as Walter, the movie's protagonist, a child molester released on parole after 12 years in Prison. Trying to slip unnoticed back into something resembling normal life, his efforts are encouraged by his burgeoning relationship with a superficially tough female collegue at the Wood Yard (where he's given a job as a favour at the beginning of the film) and his sympathetic (at least on the surface)brother-in-law).His struggles to reform his desires are impeded by a Police Detective (ably played by Mos Def)unable to believe that an ex-offender like Walter can ever not re-offend, and increasingly by his work-mates as details of his conviction are uncovered. You're very quickly draw in by the film's low-key emotionality which holds you tight as Walter is increasingly unbalanced by external pressures and his own desires. And this is where the real skill comes in as Bacon makes Walter such a compelling character that despite his past desires you end up rooting for his struggle to prevail over the Hand that life has given him. The climactic moment of decision in a park between Walter and a young girl he's befriended is delicately and movingly played, my only criticism being that what's revealed about the girl's own past is a little too convenient for a story-line that's been uncompromising up until this point. Nevertheless it's a minor miracle that a screenplay like this was financed, filmed and given a wide release, and it's easy to over-look any small imperfections as the strengths of this work are so obvious.

Bacon's portrayal of Walter is understated but redolent of the hardships of his life and the miserable awareness of the damage he's inflicted in the past. His stoic dignity and attempts to keep his long-buried pain under the control of his will are worth seeing this movie for in themselves.",1140220800,,2424,4.912195121951219

But he is still imprisoned in a mind that fears he can never be ""normal"", that is, walk down the street and past a child without inappropriate thoughts stirring up inside that he can't control. He hates himself and feels everyone else is justified to do the same.  When ""Vickie"" (played by Kyra Sedgwick), reaches out to him and ""trusts"" him to be normal, she brings redemption:  not by others, but Walter redeems himself and opens himself up to the possibility that others will come to accept him into their lives and society.

How many degrees of separation is there between Kevin Bacon and a child molester? In ""The Woodsman"", there's zero. Kevin Bacon stars in this stirring and gripping movie about the plight of a child molester who is trying to turn his life around after being put in jail for twelve years. While watching the movie I wondered if they chose to make him molest little girls as to make it a bit easier for the audience to sympathize with his character-he also beats up a man who he witnesses abduct a boy. Regardless it's still a bit of a struggle but somehow director and writer Nicole Kassell and Steven Fechter manage to pull it off. What the movie calls into question is if jail is meant for reform and as a punishment, shouldn't we as a society accept that an ex-con has put in his or her time and allow them to reclaim their life without exception?

The pedophile is Walter (Kevin Bacon, in an amazing performance) who serves 12 years in prison for raping a little girl and is released. He moves into an apartment across the street from an elementary school, where another pedophile trys to pick up little boys everyday; gets a job at a lumberyard; gets harrased by a police detective

(Mos Def); and is shunned by his sister, but not her husband (Benjamin Bratt). At the lumberyard he meets Vicki (real life wife Kyra Sedgwick) who looks past his...well...past and falls in love with him none-the-less. Problem is, Walter feels the pressures of society on him since child molestation is considered by man to be the worst thing you can do. He also can't help but feel urges every now and then. Now, this movie is hard to make; because the blatant fact is that Walter is a pedophile which most people would not feel sympathy for. The writers (Nicole Kassell & Steven Fechter) manage to portray Walter as what he is and don't really attempt to swing your feelings in any way. Problem is, you do feel sorry for Walter and the way he is treated because (from my standpoint) you realize that he is a person, although sick, he still is a person. Anyway, the title represents ""Little Red Riding Hood"" because the Woodsman is what saved Little Red Riding Hood from the stomach of the wolf.

2230532,5,B0007PID84,"In a Shakespeare literature class I once took, the professor told his students that it is believed by scholars, that every single `conflict' or problem in life that man has had to confront within himself - has been illustrated somewhere in Shakespeare's work.  If that be true, it would be interesting to see how he resolved this particular human condition.

The movie brings us face to face with a social problem that most of us have chosen to not consider much, - (beyond the fear) - let alone try to comprehend.  And admittedly, the public hasn't had much to go on, besides the heightened, nationalized tragedies most recently in Florida, etc.  To be frank, when I saw that this movie had been made (I wasn't even aware of it, until just recently!), I was skeptical.  I wasn't convinced that a film could capture even the basics of the complexities that this social dilemma holds - at least in an accurate, realistic manner.  But I bought it - hopeful that I would be surprised - and beyond my greatest imaginings --- I was!

This is a movie that really shouldn't be watched just once, because there is much that can be missed the first time around.  The topic and issues  of sex offenses is not new to me, and even then, I was mildly bewildered to find what all I had missed.  On the surface, this is a fairly unembellished movie, without any fancy sets or costumes or special effects.  But on a deeper level however, one could peel the pungent themes off like skin on an onion - and there are many to pick from.  I took a few notes during my first viewing, and finding that I needed to go back to a scene or two, I wound up re-watching the whole movie all over again, because I kept spotting things I hadn`t noticed before.

One of the things I found that added so much depth to this movie is that each of the main characters had their own unique dilemma, or better yet - `flaw' - that stood in the way of their ability to come to grips with Walter's past.

One example is Walter's brother-in-law, Carlos (BENJAMIN BRATT), who continued to maintain a supportive relationship with Walter.  Carlos couldn't see his own level of risk of sexually abusing his 12 year old daughter (Walter's niece that he has never yet met).  This worried Walter enough to discuss it with his therapist.  And when he finally confronts Carlos with it - the revolt from Carlos is excruciating to watch.

Another glimpse is found in the secretary (Eve) at work who is resentful of the rejection she felt from Walter when she attempted to make a move on him.  She finds her quick, easy source for revenge through the sex offender registry - which she fluently justifies with others' ""...right to know..."".

And then there's Walter's (future) girlfriend who we witness first hand to be sexually harassed at work as a male co-worker playfully pokes her in the rear with a broom handle.  Ironically, it is Walter who sees it for what it is - and cautiously checks her well-being as he passes her later in the cafeteria.  In a later scene, she reveals to him fragments of her own tormented past of her victimization through her three brothers. On the surface, this scene could pass as just another window into her characterization.  But on a deeper level, this scene is loaded.  Walter listens and quietly validates her pain, but she is quick to point out that ""...I love them....I love ALL by brothers...they are big, gentle men with families of their own.""  The true talent of Sedgwick oozes out not so much in the words she speaks - but in how she speaks them.  And then just as quickly, her words closes the scene; ""...and if you ever asked them what they did..., they would beat the _ _ _ _ out of you - and call you a _ _ _ _ ing liar!..."".

Another example is Sgt. Lucas (MOS DEF) - the detective who, contrary to his loathing of Walter for what Walter represents, would yet sit and quietly share some of his deepest anguish he is forced to grapple with in his job involving the crimes of sex offenders.  In a contorted sort of way, it felt as if he sought Walter out in his unconscious quest for answers to questions that haunt him.  And when he asks Walter if he believes in fairy tales - and then sadly adds how there are  ""...no woodsmen in this world..."", the connection and significance to the title hits home.

And then there's the mysterious man that Walter has named `Candy' who sits in his car and watches the passing children on their way to school.  As Candy watches the children, Walter watches Candy.  A previous reviewer mentioned how it `bothered' him that Walter did not contact someone.  And I can see how this would bother them, but they need to realize that to an individual who had just spent 12 years in prison, and who are reminded constantly that if anything goes wrong, - or even appears to have gone wrong, they are back in prison for life usually, - the police represent images from their worst nightmare.  People also need to take into consideration that the word of a sex offender is rarely - if ever - trusted, and is almost always felt to have ulterior motives.  Considering that a sex offender is now a `stranger in a strange land' and has been virtually stripped of any benefit of all doubt - any contact with law enforcement is literally laced with danger.  At any rate, Walter does deal with Candy - but in his own way, on his own terms.

And - the most difficult for me to write about - is the character, Robin.  As I reflect on what to write here, I am in awe at the courage and sensitivity the filmmakers had to have had in this scene.  But not only that - they must have put a tremendous amount of reflection into this scene, and perhaps had input from a victim or a victim's group.  They obviously started out in a different direction (based on the deleted-expanded scene in the Special Features section), which brought them to a screeching halt, with Walter's line, ""...and no matter what - - -, he will always love you..."".  [ Huh??...wait a minute....]  It wasn't going to work, and I'm so glad that they fixed it. Otherwise the whole scene would have been dysfunctional, and I would have been back to my original state of skepticism.  The big question here is, how do you capture on film, a scenario that happens everyday - and has been for generations - and capture it in a way that won't repulse the general public?...that won't compromise what the filmmakers ultimately were trying to do - to educate us, despite ourselves.  To me, this scene represented in part the single most important, but yet totally absent ingredient to date - in our approach to sex offender and victim treatment protocols --- and that is, forgiveness - which of course would lead to the ultimate goal for all concerned - closure.  In Robin's case, she needed help - but far and beyond the kind of 'help' that the police force and a judge could offer her, which is so, so very inadequate and incomplete.  But revealing her victimization and acknowledging it as a very painful - but real, part of her life was a first step.  And Walter needed to experience - in it's purest form possible - the pain that victims feel.  He needed to come face to face with the monster - that he denies that he is to others, but most certainly fears that he may be, himself - so that he may wrestle it down.  Because the simple fact of the matter is, if he doesn't - he will likely fail.  The only thing I would like to point out is, when Walter reminds his girlfriend about the `poor odds' of his rehabilitation - this has now shown to be absolutely untrue.  Recidivism rates for sex offenders who have undergone treatment are among the best of most criminal statistics.  (US Dept. of Justice)  This is especially true if they are able to rehabilitate fully, back into society (in terms of finding employment, housing and a social support network - which the public registry renders nearly impossible).

Overall, the acting was superb - which, by the way - I understand the actors were not paid for, at least initially.

Although it may seem that this reveals a lot of the movie, be assured that it barely scratches the surface.  This is what is so remarkable about this film.  There isn't a scene that doesn't have several layers to it.  In a nutshell, if this is the young Nicole Kassell's first film, I can't even begin to imagine what a glorious future she holds in store for us!  You go, Girl!...",1132790400,,8387,4.470433639947437

This pains me to watch, but the truth overcomes. This is not about 'Monsters' (starring Charlize Theron) a sympthathic film through the eyes of a serial killer, one sided--but rather, The Woodsman starring Kevin Bacon, reveals all side. Eve disgusts me. Mos Def disgusts me. Kevin Bacon and his workers disgusts me, including his own wife, for falling into the same snare. The theraphist disgusts me. The father of the little girl disgusts me. I digust myself. For this film shows we are all alike, and have similar wants, things we desire forbidden by law--the little red ball rolling the twisting, dark path. For the ball is a symbolization of the carnel things we lust, and fall into, whatever that may be; we all have addictions. This is not a film.
This is a mirror of ourselves.",1132358400,,918,4.672839506172839
2230534,4,B0007PID84,"Wow.  How did Kevin Bacon not get nominated for something, and how did this movie fly under my radar screen until very recently. . . ?  Obviously the subject matter is ""distasteful"" and ""uncomfortable.""  Walter's self-awareness, self-doubt, self-loathing, self-improvement, and self-preservation are incredibly compelling when presented in such a short feature.  Of course we don't know whether or not to ""like"" his character (as one earlier reviewer questioned)--that's the whole point. . . !  He is both sympathetic and repulsive, as are his actions.

This movie puts a face, albeit a fictional one, to a very real problem in our society.  How do we stop crime while rehabiliting criminals?  It is a difficult catch-22.  We want to punish those who do wrong, but we have no way to truly ""fix"" them.  Our legal system sets free many individuals who have no right to be walking the streets to commit further crimes.  In contrast, many people who have made past mistakes are given no opportunity to ""move on with their lives"" without judgment, harassment, and discrimination by those around them.  What do we do. . . ?

Does Walter deserve the proverbial ""second chance""?  Did he deserve a longer sentence in the first place?  If his own family cannot forgive him, why should society as a whole, much less a coworker with her own checkered past. . . ?  Is he truly capable of making rational decisions regarding his desires?  Do we forgive him or punish him further?  Does he become a productive member of society or just a ""repeat offender""?  Does our system truly allow him to make that choice?  Should it. . . ?

Wow, that's a pile of questions from a movie (and a short one at that, thus only four stars--the writer and director could have explored this character even more).  If all of Hollywood were as committed as this to putting forth such complex ideas and characters, who knows what might happen.  Some people don't like movies that leave more questions unanswered than answered, and this is one of those films.  Again, Kevin Bacon certainly deserved a nomination of some sort.  The producers and director deserve some recognition for having the brass to put out a movie that would be both controversial and possibly productive--the former is very easy to do, the latter much more difficult. . . .

Bottom Line:  Most definitely worth a watch/rental, at the very least.  As a parent, I was challenged to examine my positions on the laws, their enforcement (or lack thereof), and the consequences of both.  As a movie-goer, I loved the range of emotions that Walter's character was allowed to express so well through Kevin Bacon.  Two authors I have read recently, Edward Bunker (LITTLE BOY BLUE, DOG EAT DOG, NO BEAST SO FIERCE) and Russell Banks (RULE OF THE BONE), have effectively addressed similar topics involving the United States criminal justice system.  This movie does so as effectively in a different format.  Give it a shot, but be ready to be uncomfortable--it's a good thing in this case.",1131667200,,3012,4.833659491193738
2230535,4,B0007PID84,"I love Kevin Bacon.  He's so versatile.  As I watched this chilling tale about a pedophile who was trying to establish a new life for himself following release from prison, I tried to picture Bacon dancing in Footloose!  Impossible.  He's such a wonderful actor that he really makes us believe that he is his character.

Having said that, I didn't like his character -- not because the guy was a sex offender, but rather because he lacked any form of affect.  It was hard to know whether we were meant to sympathize or empathize with the protagonist since his personality was so flat.

The movie raised all kinds of thorny issues about whether or not it's possible for pedophiles to be rehabilitated and it did so in a thoughtful and sensitive manner.  But it was slow in parts and became dreary due to the complete absence of any humor (and perhaps the dialogue could have been more crisp.)

I would recommend it but not as a date movie and not if you're looking for something uplifting.

2230538,5,B0007PID84,"The Woodsman (Nicole Kassel, 2004)

I am stymied by Hollywood. (Anyone who's been reading my reviews for more than a month is probably already well aware of this.) Every once in a while-- and not infrequently-- a movie that, were it given a chance, would likely perform in a sensational manner is completely overlooked, while films of deep inferiority take over the cineplexes. As a case in point, consider Julian Schabel's wonderful 2000 film Before Night Falls-- if not the best film extant at the present time, easily in the top ten. Released on Christmas Day of 2000, Before Night Falls opened on just eight screens, and drew an impressive (for a movie opening on eight screens) over-$10,000 per theatre. While a select few were treated to a first look, the rest of us made do with such fare as Dracula 2000, which opened on the same day on 2,204 screens-- and in the same time period as Before Night Falls, pulled in less than $4,000 per screen. The worst part is, I'm pretty sure there's not a single Hollywood exec who looked back on Christmas 2000 and thought to himself, ""man, we should have given Before Night Falls the big push and scrapped Dracula 2000.""

Four years and a day later, Nicole Kassel (currently adapting the late Arthur Miller's The Ride Down Mt. Morgan) saw The Woodsman open on just six screens. It didn't quite make the $10,000-per-screen mark, but it performed respectably enough. In contrast, that year's Dracula 2000 was Fat Albert, which opened on a remarkable-even-today 2,674 screens. Amusingly, it grossed almost to the penny the same amount per screen as Dracula 2000-- $3,747. (One wonders how many of those patrons demanded, but did not get, refunds.) Once again, I doubt there's a single studio exec who regretted consigning The Woodsman to the ""let's open it on enough screens to get considered for the Oscars"" pit while covering the rest of the moviegoing world in the suffocating crap that was Fat Albert. Are you getting why I am stymied by Hollywood?

There are some films so powerful, so emotionally engaging, that I can't imagine even the most cold-hearted entertainment lawyer not looking at them and saying ""you want to open Fat Albert on that many screens and neglect this? Are you mad?"" The Woodsman is one of those films. In it, Kevin Bacon plays Walter Rossman, a convicted child molester paroled after twelve years in prison. He goes back to work at a lumberyard where he has previously worked (no one there but the boss was around when he got sent up, it would seem), gets an apartment overlooking a grade school, and goes to see a therapist a lot. (Oddly, a parole officer never makes an appearance.) Rossman just wants to get on with his life, but a co-worker whose advances he spurned is first day on the job (Eve, in a remarkably understated performance) and a cop who hates sex offenders (Mos Def) aren't going to let him be. Worse off, there's a suspicious-looking guy in a white car who hangs out across the street from the grade school, and Walter is torn between his fear of and hatred for the cops and the knowledge that this guy might well be another child molester.

It's a lot for an eighty-seven-minute film to handle, and for the most part, it's all handled with expertise. Kevin Bacon's performance is stunning, perhaps even better than his job in Stir of Echoes. Even better, the rest of the cast supporting him also turn in career-best-or-close-to-it roles, including David Alan Grier in a surprising dramatic turn, given far too little screen time, and Bacon's real-life wife Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer), who hasn't been this good since Singles. The performances alone make this a great film, but there's more to it than that. Kassel has an excellent eye for detail (look at the face of the girl in the mall when she notices Bacon staring at him; her change of expression is absolutely perfect) that can make all the difference between being above-average and being in the stratosphere. In fact, about the only thing really wrong with this film can probably be blamed on the play from which it's adapted; there's one plot thread that is left at the end framing a gaping hole. I'm all for ambiguity, but that was kind of ridiculous.

Still, this is one of the best movies you will see this year. Do so as soon as you can. It's flirting with inclusion in my 100-best list. **** ",1126137600,,4349,4.700787401574803

  Its the slow-paced, small-town kind of movie with the main character being a broken man who was imprisoned, reformed, and set free. The only problem is, he's not entirely free. He's a prisoner of his own past, but you find out that his problems began early in life, for reasons that even real-life psychologists have no solid explanation for. Maybe some people are just born broken.
  You start to sympathize with his daily plight to be ""normal"", but the writers never let you forget about what he is. He redeems himself, in a way, towards the end, but he is left to try to pick up the pieces of his shattered life.",1125360000,,794,4.380952380952381

2230541,4,B0007PID84,"This is certainly a film that deserves to be watched. It's challenging, well acted and the sort of character-driven material that Hollywood doesn't often invest in. It's not perfect, though. I guess I'm giving it a pretty high rating, but I'm also not of the opinion that this is great world cinema. It seems that with these reviews on Amazon if an American film aspires to intellectual quality it gets a host of raves. I guess that's good in that I want HWood to do these type of films more. On the other hand, though, I feel like some of these folks should see a little more world cinema - then they might weigh this on more reasonable scales.

The things that don't work so well for me are that Kevin Bacon's character is really never the sexual predator we're suppose to feel he is. We know he's done bad stuff, but in this film you're always on his side - or the film wants you to be. You're always sympathetic to him and never really believe he's going to do anything awful in this movie. In a way he's an ad for why we shouldn't descriminate against pedofiles. Yes, he does have a relationship with a girl and you know you're supposed to fear for what might happen, but I was never on the edge of my seat. In typical Hollywood form this movie simplifies the main character, even as it tries to convince you that it's complex, edgy, unusual. This is the type of movie that some studio executive was willing to finance because it had clear Oscar contender written all over it. I don't hate it because of that, but it did show in the filmaking.

I do think Kyra Sedgwick was great in this. I don't really remember when I saw her last. Who knew she had this hard-edge, jaded beauty in her? It was quite a role for her to take on, one that acknowledges her aging. She deserved more attention than she got for it.",1123977600,,1814,4.316715542521994

2230543,5,B0007PID84,"I was hesitant to watch this movie.  Especially given the seemingly nonstop litany of violent crimes committed by pedophiles in the past couple of years, one doesn't naturally gravitate toward a movie based upon a pedophile's attempt to reenter society.  Most of us don't want to have and most likely cannot possibly have the least bit of sympathy for any child molester, but this issue is more complex than I for one would like it to be - and The Woodsman gives evidence to this fact.  This is a movie people need to watch - it doesn't offer any real solutions, but it is extremely thought-provoking and can help us try to better understand the depths of what has become an epidemic preying on our children - and you can't solve a problem without understanding it first.  It is important to note that the main character here is not a level-three sex offender; he's not a monster, just a man with a very severe problem - one that he is trying to overcome.

Walter (Kevin Bacon) has just been released from prison, having served twelve years for molesting young girls.  We are never told exactly what his crimes involved, although he says he never hurt any of his victims.  He was fortunate to find a job at a lumber mill and a place to live (although, most troublingly, his apartment is across the street from an elementary school).  He sees a therapist every week and receives regular visits from a police detective, both of which are necessary because, no matter how much he wants to be normal, he still has terrible urges to fall back into his old ways.  Society doesn't make it easy for him, as those who learn of his past shun him or threaten him with violence - everyone except Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick), who eventually comes to accept him as he is.  Everyone else treats him like a monster - and, when his emotional crisis hits its crescendo, he is driven to the brink of becoming exactly the kind of monster everyone already thinks he is.  There's no solution to this; society has to know about these people living amongst them, yet that widespread knowledge represents a brick wall in the subject's road to reform.  Again, I'm talking about understanding, not sympathy, here.  For any pedophile truly wanting to escape his urges and become normal, society as a whole offers an almost insurmountable challenge - that's just a fact.

Kevin Bacon does an incredible job here - as does young Hannah Pilkes, whose acting in a pivotal scene is on par with Bacon's own.  Walter's problems are internalized for the most part, yet so much of what he goes through inside his own head communicates itself to the viewer through Bacon's nuanced performance.  Walter does want to be normal, but it is incredibly difficult for him to get to that point when he is basically left completely on his own.  His moments of weakness lead to some emotionally disturbing scenes (nothing graphic, of course - not even close); if you're not uncomfortable watching this movie, I would hope our paths never cross.  Don't avoid the film just because it makes you uncomfortable, though.  It's really a powerful story that culminates in an excellent ending - I won't describe it at all, but I must say it is really a fitting conclusion that builds upon the main character's struggles throughout the film.

As someone who feels all sex offenders should be permanently removed from society at large, I can recommend the film even to those who - like me - see the problem in black and white terms.  This movie hasn't changed my way of thinking, but it has certainly made me think about the complexities of the problem and compelled me to look at someone such as Walter as a sick yet still very human individual.  The Woodsman may not be entertaining, but it is a bold and important film that will challenge your perceptions and stay with you long after the end credits roll.",1122595200,,3845,4.640117994100295
2230544,5,B0007PID84,"If ever there was a film to make you squirm, both internally and externally, this is it.

While watching this amazing little flick (90 minutes), my moral compass was spinning around as if I were standing at the North Pole - that's an acutely direct compliment to the acting and production of this movie but not necessarily its subject matter: the redemption of a pedofile.

As many of us would want, if we ever caught up with a child molester, we'd love to beat the cr@p out of him. Beat him to a pulp for stealing away the innocence of a child. Try to pound some moral sense into him (even in prison child molesters are held as subhuman and often beaten or killed.) But can we be judge, jury, and executioner - in any personal moral sense - because of what we ""think we know"" about a person and their serious societal flaws? These are tough questions which are all thrown at the viewer of ""The Woodsman"". Notice I said ""thrown at"" and not ""forced upon"". That's an important distinction. For not once did I feel that the script was trying to be sympathetic to criminals, police, or our society. The film shows you the good AND the bad of all of these.

The story flows around a recently paroled child molester, Walter (Kevin Bacon), who now lives in a dumpy apartment in ""anywhere"" USA. But problems immediately arise for Walter: his apartment, the only one that would allow him in, is directly across from a grade school playground; a cop comes by to harass him and tell him what a scumbag he still is; someone at his job finds out about his past and begins distributing flyers about him; and a child stalker (nicknamed ""Candy"") is prowling near the playground while Walter watches him with both disgust and anguish.

Throughout the film we also see Walter visiting his court appointed therapist, who asks tough questions, and Walter replies with equal brusqueness. He continually asks his therapist ""When will I be normal?"", feeling the weight of his ""illness"" every minute of every day. And this is an important set of narratives, because we see Walter wanting to be normal, we can feel the internal battle within him as he struggles with his past and his more uncertain future.

Added to the film is an attractive co-worker, Kyra Sedgwick (Kevin Bacon's real life wife), who becomes a strange kind of girlfriend that Walter MUST confide in at some point. And when he finally does tell her why he was in prison, you could cut the tension surrounding both of them with a knife. I found myself holding my breath, waiting for her to respond to his history.

But if I held my breath for a moment there, I literally stopped breathing when Walter follows a young girl into a park and begins speaking with her. By this time in the film, most viewers probably are cheering for Walter to succeed in becoming a normal member of his community. We've felt the terrible pedofile lust trying to move away from this flawed man, and we're happy for him. But society won't leave him alone, and now he seems to be slipping back into some horrible old habits. Or is he? Can this child he follows into the park help ""The Woodsman"" be redeemed? It's amazing to me, too, that the title of the film is ""The Woodsman"". This is the tale of Little Red Riding Hood who is cut from the Wolf's belly and removed unscathed. And the little girl Walter follows into the park, if you watch closely, is wearing a little red cape.

I'm going to leave my review here, as I don't want to give away too much more about what happens in the park (the pivotal moment of the film). But I will say that this is a terribly uncomfortable film to watch, which is why you should. If you want to feel challenged in any real moral sense, this movie is your best bet.",1121904000,,3720,4.477876106194691

Asking that we suspend our judgment the movie focuses on the character's attempt to find his way into society.  All the while he is tempted by old patterns that well up from dimly hinted at desire for childhood intimacy.

Does Walter deserve another chance?  Shouldn't it be one strike and you're out?  Aren't the odds overwhelmingly against him? Will he continue fighting off temptation until the end of his life?  What about Walter's fellow blue collar coworkers?  Should they know about his criminal past?  Isn't it possible that he might molest their own children at a company picnic?  Such questions unavoidably pop up during one's viewing of this disturbing film.

The Woodsman, of course, is not escapist entertainment.  You may even have to force yourself not to look away from the screen.  However, I argue that every adult citizen must address this issue.  The safety of our children depends on it.  This is easily a five star production.  If nothing else, it is an artistic achievement deserving of high praise.  There are a number of fine performances.

His latest feature, The Woodsman, is a dark tale of a former child molester, Walter, who is released on parole and returns to his old hometown to assimilate back into ordinary life. Even though the main character's situation doesn't cause any sympathy, but disgust, from the viewers, his ambition to become normal again and the struggles he has to endure to realize that goal makes the viewer want him to succeed. Kyra Sedgwick, Bacon's real life wife, plays his co-worker who falls in love with him and, after knowing his past, supports him in regaining a clean social status. Walter also gets indirect help from a young girl who enjoys birdwatching by snapping out of his disease after realizing the disturbing and deep secrets that she has locked up inside.

Whether the critics slam this picture in its entirety because of its subject matter or not, one thing remains true about this movie and that is it features Kevin Bacon in his most captivating performance to date. Oscar on the way for Bacon? Maybe not for this one, but soon down the line.

2230550,5,B0007PID84,This movie is very well done and it gives you a perspective of a sexual offender that has not yet been shown in a movie. It is subtle and sensitive to this issue.,1120608000,,162,3.9393939393939394
2230551,5,B0007PID84,"Kevin Bacon is extremely effective in evoking empathy for one of the most despicable criminal types, the child molester, in the film he produced, ""The Woodsman"".

Paroled after 12 years in prison, Bacon playing the pedophile Walter, is trying to reconstitute his decimated life.  He is scorned by his family with his brother in law Carlos, played by Benjamin Bratt being the only exception.  He manages to find employment in a lumberyard where he had previously worked for the sympathetic present owner's father.  He keeps to himself and eventually becomes involved with tough shelled but compassionate fellow worker Vicki played by his real life wife Kyra Sedgewick. We learn that she also has some repressed issues.

Amazingly, Bacon lives in an apartment overlooking a schoolyard where temptation is within his view.  Even after 12 years he must battle to keep his everpresent internal demons at bay.  He is checked on periodically by police sergeant Lucas played nicely by Mos Def.  He peers through his window at the children playing while writing in a journal as suggested by his shrink.  While ruminating he becomes aware of a guy who he believes in stalking the children, plying them with goodies.

Just as he begins to establish a life with some normalcy, lumberyard office worker Mary Kay played by rap star Eve finds out his secret while surfing the web.  She spills the beans via a flyer to her fellow co-workers causing conflict at the job.  This causes Bacon to become unsettled.  He follows a young girl who he had previously met in a park while she was birdwatching.

In the most poignant scene in the film, Bacon who feels the need to accost the young girl, is using his smoothest lines to get over on the 11 year old girl Robin played well by Hannah Pikes.

In the course of conversation it becomes apparent that the unfortunate child has already been subjected to abuse by her pathetic father.  This tear jerking scene snaps Bacon out of his pedophilic funk getting him back on track to the restoration of his life.

Bacon went far out on a limb making a movie with such sensitive subject matter.  With the deft touch of director Nicole Kassell the film effectively examines a wide array of emotions in response to this tabooed issue.",1120262400,,2253,4.7927461139896375
2230552,5,B0007PID84,"There is a psychological reason why child rape - even statuatory rape - molestation is considered by far the most heinous crime. In Western society, we see children not as human beings with their own needs and feelings, but as abstract symbols of innocence. When that innocence is broken, people feel personally violated.

In this movie, Kevin Bacon plays the role of a newly-released ""child rapist"" trying to live a quiet life, struggling against his desires for children. His family has disowned him, and he doesn't want to relate to anyone, for fear of being found out.

This is a very intelligent and honest movie. The first thing it shows us, is that we like to brand child molestors ""monsters"" - but as his co-workers learn the truth about his crimes and assault him, it becomes harder to figure out who's the monster, if any. In a society where so-called ""normal"" people demand someone, anyone, to be jailed or die when a crime occurs, it becomes hard to make the difference.

Many reviewers are perhaps stubbornly ""normal"", or have no empathy, but they seem to have missed the point. Bacon's character is not a scumbag, but a pedophile who gave into his sexual desires and got caught. He truly believes that he is not hurting anyone. Perhaps this concept is too hard to accept for many people.

It also, perhaps tangentially, drives the point home that our children are not protected by the arbitrary and coercive family structure we have today... merely made servants of, oftentimes, evil or negligeant parents.

The cast is solid, but Bacon's performance is especially right on spot. The ending is depressing and bleak, but it only adds to the content. There is no way for a person like that to win in our society. Don't let the subject matter discourage you, this is one powerful and intelligent movie.",1120176000,,1813,4.779552715654952
2230553,5,B0007PID84,"This film deals with an unusual topic, as it sneaks a peek into the life of a pedophile. The pedophile in question is Walter (Kevin Bacon), who returns home to try and re-build his life, after spending twelve years in prison for his unspeakable acts involving young girls.  Shunned by his community, former friends, and family, with the exception of his affable brother-in-law, Carlos (Benjamin Bratt), Walter's re-entry into society is one that is solitary and bereft of all that makes life worth living.

He secures an apartment right across from a grammar school, because that landlord is the only one in town who will rent to him.  Walter goes to work in a lumber yard, where he works for the fair-minded Bob (David Alan Grier). There, Walter meets Bob's attractive secretary, Eve (Mary-Kay), who apparently has the hots for him, but whose initially friendly overtures Walter rebuffs. His eye is drawn to the feisty Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick), a seemingly tough, hard living gal with secrets of her own.

When Vicki and Walter hook up and get better acquainted, Eve takes their pairing hard and makes it her business to find out more about Walter's past.  Meanwhile, Walter and Vicki are becoming an item, and when she finally gets him to reveal something of his past, she is initially aghast to discover that he is a convicted pedophile. Walter reacts to her shock by cutting her off, physically and emotionally .

When Eve discovers a treasure trove of information about Walter's past, she shares it with her co-workers. This  causes Vicki to come to his defense, and they are eventually reunited. While all this is going on, there are a variety of subplots that further reinforce Walter's isolation and underscore his attempts at living a normal life.  He is mandated to visit a therapist as a condition of his release from prison, and it is there that the viewer gets a birds-eye view into why Walter may have the problem that he has.

Walter is undeniably attracted to young girls, and the viewer sees him conflicted by his compulsion. Brief and subtle flashbacks to those events that eventually saw him imprisoned further draw the viewer into Walter's personal demons. The viewer even sees Walter occasionally giving into that seemingly irresistible compulsion, only to see him pull back before it takes him to the brink of no return, his quest for normalcy always at odds with his seemingly innate proclivity. The scene in the park with eleven year old Robin (Hannah Pilkes) is a chilling one, as it seems as if Walter will be unable to control his compulsion, only to be brought up short by an unexpected revelation.

 Meanwhile, Walter is eager to mend bridges with his estranged sister, Annette, who, with her husband, Carlos, has a twelve year old daughter. Annette, however, is far from eager to do so and makes her dislike and mistrust of her pedophile brother evident in a number of ways. Meanwhile, a certain Sgt. Lukas (Mos Def) is keeping tabs on Walter, making sure that he makes Walter feels as low as the regard in which he holds him.

All of this serves to create a fascinating portrait of a pedophile. Kevin Bacon gives a stellar, award-worthy performance that certainly merits recognition. It is simply a stunning, tightly controlled performance, and one that will keep the viewer spellbound. If ever there were a performance that was worthy of an Academy Award, it is this performance by Kevin Bacon, which is a career best. It is a shame that it was entirely disregarded by the Academy.

Bacon's real life wife, Kyra Sedgwick, likewise gives a performance that is three dimensional and compelling in the role of Vicki, the woman who was able to see some good in this convicted pedophile. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent in their respective roles. Kudos must also go to first time director Nicole Russell, who makes her debut with this feature film, exhibiting a certain mastery and deftness for one so young. She also wrote this well-nuanced, metaphoric, and intelligent script.  This is a film that deserves to be in one's personal collection.",1118793600,,4086,4.843615494978479
2230554,4,B0007PID84,"The Woodsman is an icky film. It is based on a play of the same name. The subject matter is what makes it really icky. The story centers on Walter (Kevin Bacon), a man who has just been released from 12 years in prison for molesting little girls. How does he function in society? How is he viewed by his peers? How will he be treated? Has he been rehabilitated?

The answers to the questions aren't the ones that you would typically see in a film with the star power that this one carries. This film ""should"" have been made independently with little or unknown actors. However, for some reason, it garnered huge star power: Kevin Bacon in the lead as the pedophile, Walter; Kyra Sedgewick(Bacon's real life wife) as a co-worker who befriends Walter; Mos Def as a detective determined to find a reason to kick Walter back into prison; David Allen Grier, in an almost cameo role as Walter's boss.

Kevin Bacon delivers a home run in his performance! I've never seen him do anything near as good and he's had some great opportunities. The raw emotion he demonstrates is such that he makes you feel Walter's pain and shame; unfortunately (for me) he can also make you get into Walter's head too well. Kyra Sedgewick plays a hard life broad who is also firing on all cylinders. She also delivers a performance worthy of great praise. But it was Mos Def who really blew me out of the water. Let me explain - I think Bacon deserves an Oscar for his performance, but then I've known he was a good actor for a long time. Mos Def? Mos Def? I saw him in The Italian Job and I thought he was great! I couldn't believe this guy used to be a rapper. Now, in this part as a detective, he performance was so subtly nuanced that you could read his mind.

I don't know of many films at all where I was actually given chills by the performances: but I was in this one. Bacon underplays his character to just the right degree. Walter is a real person with real emotions. Bacon obviously stopped going to the gym for a long time in order to make Walter more believable. Walter's not fat, nor is he thin, he's just not in shape. Walter reacts angrily to his shrink sitting behind him. While it's not overtly said, you know it's because Walter was sexually assaulted repeatedly and frequently while in prison as most child molesters are.

It's these small touches that make this film so amazing.

In fact, it is those very same reasons that make it impossible for me to give it 5 stars. The acting is awesome. However, I felt like I liked Walter a little too much. I sympathized with him too much. After all, he admits to his sexual deviency, so I should dislike him. Bacon pulls you in though. And that is what I didn't like.

But to the filmmaker's credit - these are not cardboard characters. These are real people with real emotions and real lives.

The subject matter alone will prevent Bacon, Sedgewick, and Mos Def from even being nominated for an Oscar, though they deserve to be.

That is actually quite a shame, because they deserve the nod much moreseo than many others who will be nominated for lighter fare.",1118275200,,3097,4.430579964850615
2230555,4,B0007PID84,"The Woodsman is not easy film to digest, because it deals with a taboo subject of pedophilia, and there's disturbing dialogues and scenes. It's anti-hero leading role is brilliantly played by Kevin Bacon, who obviously risked his image to transform himself into a child molestor, and ultimately delivered his most powerful performance! Honestly, this film is well written and the characters are meticulously portrayed, especially Bacon's, and in the end, I can understand and sympathize with his character.

Kevin Bacon played Walter, who had been in prison for 12 years for having molested two girls between the age of 9 and 11, and he's released on parole for the first time. He gets a job at the local lumberyard, where he met co-worker Vicki(Kyra Sedgwick), and they eventually became lovers. She became supportive of him, despite learning about his criminal background, and intended to help him change for the better. Everyone at work condemned him when Mary-Kay(Eve) spread the works about Walter's dark past.

Meanwhile, Walter's been seeing his brother-in-law Carlos(Benjamin Bratt), and tried to reconnect with his estranged sister who has not forgiven him. His parole officer(Mos Def) is quite hostile towards him, and suspects his behaviours. With all the stress he had to face, he started to lose control of himself, and his inner demon gradually propelled him to act out his desire for little girls again. He followed an 11 year old girl(Robin/Hannah Pilkes) to the park, and proceeded to socailize with her, but he declined to take an advantage of her. When he saw her for the second time in the park, their conversation profoundly touched him and discouraged him to make his move on her. From that moment on, he was finally letting go of the monster in him.

Kyra Sedgwick gave a striking supporting performance. She was mesmerizing in the scene when Bacon confessed the truth about his past, and she was so shocked and confused. Hannah Pilkes did a great job playing the scene opposite Bacon, it was truly intense and moving.",1117929600,,2041,5.014749262536873
2230556,5,B0007PID84,"I was going through the ""Dvd"" (don't want to mention names) store for my weekend rentals and happen to come across this sitting on the shelf and picked it up.  Suddenly, a young woman behind me started talking to me saying, ""Now that was really an intense movie!""  I turned to face her and noticed that she was  wearing a uniform with a name tag from the ""Dvd"" store I was in.  I kind of smiled and she continued chatting (Maybe because she was being a good sales person I suppose or maybe just because she was a ""Chattie"" Cathy)...Anyway, she told me briefy what it was about and that all the actors in the movie did it for free!  I looked her directly in the eyes with confusion written upon my face, this sort of blank expression and said quickly back, ""Free"", What do you exactly mean by...free""?  She kind of smiled and said, ""Oh yeah, it's true, all the actors in this film never received a dime to act in this film.  They all just wanted to be in the film and get it out!  (O.k. she had me... Hook, Line and Sinker!) Well, I guess Miss ""Chattie"" Cathy turned out to be one great sales person after all! :) I had to see this movie, so I rented it! (Oh yeah, she also talked me into two Hershey bars (with almonds) and a tub of buttered popcorn!) :) Now, truthfully on the record, I have to admit, I never have been a huge fan of Kevin Beacon, but man, does he do this part justice!  Truly an Oscar performance 100%!  I found the film very disturbing and even a little...

(Strike that, rewind...)

I mean, I found it ""ALOT""... nauseating!!!  Not nauseating in the conventional sense, but because of the subject matter, child molestation.  It really burned me up watching many of the scenes, that I actually found myself digging my fingers into my palms.  Especially during the scene with the little girl on the park bench.  I found myself so engulfed that I actually said out loud, ...""Dear lord please don't let him do what I think he is going to do""!!!  This movie was gripping, pure and simple, and for Kevin Beacon to take on such a role as an actor I give the man a standing ovation. (again not because of the subject matter...but because it took some guts to play such a role!)

  It really makes you stop and think how innocense can be wipped in a second by such brutal acts!  God Bless all the children of this world!",1117843200,,2331,4.288329519450801
2230557,4,B0007PID84,"There are plenty more reviews on this page which do a much better job describing the plot than I could, so I'll dispense with most of the formalities.  I will say that Kevin Bacon's performance as a paroled pedophile trying to readjust to life on the outside ranks as one of his finest, and he was sorely overlooked for an Oscar nod.  Likewise, real-life wife Kyra Sedgewick brings far more shadings to what could have been a standard ""girlfriend"" role than the screenplay allows.  In fact, good performances all around and an assured directorial debut by Nicole Kassel.  I highly reccomend checking it out.  As a matter of fact, I urge people to see this movie, if only to know if I'm way off base with my interpretation.

Is ""The Woodsman"" homophobic?  Speaking as a red-blooded, card-carrying heterosexual (though I suppose if a cute guy comes along I could reconsider) this shouldn't matter too much to me.  I'm just wondering out loud here.  In a film that deals with pedophilia, and one which presents two female characters admitting to being abused by male members of their family, how can homophobia even register?  While Bacon's character struggles to ""be normal,"" in his words, he notices a man who he calls ""Candy"" trying to lure young boys into his car.  It takes one to know one, right?  (SPOILER ALERT! Read no further if you'd prefer to find out for yourself)  Later on, when Candy is physically assaulted, even the Javert-like detective played by Mos Def seems to approve.  In other words:  man-on-girl pedophilia is bad, but man-on-boy pedophilia is really bad, take-the-law-into-your-own-hands bad.  We are supposed to feel some sympathy for the struggles of het pedophile Bacon, but a perv who picks on boys must get dealt with NOW!  Straight pedophiles are victims of their own desires who nobly battle with their inner demons and just want to live a normal life, but their gay counterparts--well, they ARE demons, unwilling or unable to control themselves.  While it's bold for a kinda-mainstream picture like this to suggest that someone like Kevin Bacon's Walter might be deserving of sympathy, this is undercut by what I perceive as an implicit double standard.

As my four-star rating may attest, I really do like this movie, not as a social statement, but from a purely aesthetic viewpoint.  It's generally quiet, thoughtful tone is a welcome relief from the bombast that Hollywood usually pumps out (I like bombast as well, but like tira mi su, you can't have it every day).  I just wonder if the filmmakers, like Walter, also have some issues to work out as well.",1117843200,,2591,4.843181818181818
2230558,4,B0007PID84,"I won't go into the plot of this very thought-provoking film since so many others have already done so.  What I will say is this work is worth seeing strictly based on Kevin Bacon's performance, which I believe is the finest of his career.  I also applaud him for taking on the subject matter of pedophilia and humanizing it in a way that does not try to convince us that child molestation is a misunderstood condition undeserving of public ridicule as much as it tells us that behind the monster facade of the pedophile is often a tortured soul.

This is the type of film that will never get the kudos it deserves simply because of its controversial subject matter.  And I agree with one reviewer who said Bacon should have gotten an Oscar nod.  His performance was so incredible that he achieved what few actors do - he made me believe he wasn't acting!  At times I felt as if I was privy to the unsettling the life of a real person.  Too bad Hollywood tends to reward performances that fall in line with its formulaic approach to filmmaking.  There have been a few exceptions, but not many.",1117584000,,1093,4.457286432160804
2230559,4,B0007PID84,"Kevin Bacon plays a man who is trying to adjust to civilian life after twelve years in prison for molesting girls between 9 and 12 years old. Tough subject. Bacon gives a fine performance as a man trying to find his behavior as monstrous as society sees it. Tries, fails, tries again and perhaps succeeds when he finds a kind of co-traveller lurking around a schooyard across the street from his apartment and shows him less mercy than he did himself during recent stalking trips through a public park. His redemption comes through the kind of vengeful violence that he rightly fears (and to some extent, suffers) from others, but the darker implications of this redemption are unfortunately left unexplored. He even gets to move in with his new and very mature girlfriend, well played by Bacon's real-life wife, Kyra Sedgwick. In other words, a very Hollywood ending to a very un-Hollywood movie.",1117411200,,897,4.869281045751634
2230560,5,B0007PID84,"What a difficult subject. Kevin Bacon deserves a lot of credit for his courage in taking this on, and for doing so in a fair and balanced way. His portrayal of a man who would be broadly regarded as the lowest of the low reveals the compulsion that drives the molestor to commit such acts. He also gives the viewer glimpses into the self-disgust and self-hatred that many of these individuals feel. His struggle to control his impulses, and his fear of allowing himself to feel any emotion lest the most hideous one overtake him, is clearly communicated. Dealing with the absolute contempt of all who know his dark secret provides yet another source of deep conflict. The little girl who nearly becomes his next victim turns in a well-controlled, subtle performance. Kyra Sedgwick is also to be admired for her portrayal of a victim who has managed not to let her childhood  trauma ruin or run her life. It must have been strange for her to think of her real-life husband as a sex offender and put herself through all the emotions that would accompany such a revelation.

The Woodsman approaches all these conflicts, and many others, in a way that allows the audience to sympathize with the offender without condoning what he did. It is gratifying to watch him tentatively open himself to another and to begin, just begin,  to discover his own humanity.",1116720000,,1353,4.72457627118644
2230561,5,B0007PID84,"Many people are often left with disgust after watching this film, because they don't understand the writer's reasons and intentions for making the film.  If you have the time, I encourage you to watch the movie with the commentary by director Nicole Kassell.  Watch it with an open mind and you will learn that this film was not made to make people feel sorry for pedophiles or anything along those lines like that.  You will understand it was made to appreciate an incredible struggle.  The end of the film is by no means an end of the story or ultimate redemption of the Walter character either, it is just the beginning of Walter's steps in the right direction to become ""normal.""  Also, I think an Oscar goes to Kevin Bacon for this film.",1116288000,,742,4.548872180451128

I have seen most of his movies and his been impressed by his range (I still fail to see how many less talented actors with less range get nominated, ah, well). The emotional ranges are impressive and realistic. Some of the other reviewers have done such an excellent job, I will stop here and defer to them.",1116028800,,366,4.477611940298507
2230563,3,B0007PID84,"The WOODSMAN features excellent acting by Bacon and Sedgewick..BUT.... we have to question the motivations behind the Hollywood film community who seem to be recently releasing a load of similiar films trying to evoke sympathy for Child Molestors and Pedophiles.

What is the point of this movie ?

What is the real motivation behind the writers and creators of this film ?

This socially liberal mindset that seems to be poisoning America is beginning to concern me.

It seems there is a movement afoot to try and rationalize all forms of behaviour as acceptable and tell us we should be tolerant of people's differences no matter how evil, twisted, sick or perverted.

Great job done as a film in terms of acting and production..... but not sure I like the message trying to be sent.",1115942400,,785,4.785185185185185
2230564,5,B0007PID84,"This movie is a classic in my book. It deals with a very complex subject matter such as pedophilia. This film will of course make you feel digusted but also it'll make you have some sympathy for the lead character as it appears this is something that's pretty much out of his control. I would dare to say just like being a homosexual except pedophiles have it worse in our society.
Again, it's all very complicated and this film has managed to balance it all out somehow.
Too bad the Oscars and Golden Globes have decided to ignore Kevin Bacon's CLASSIC portrayal of the lead character in this film. It's his best work yet! I believe he was robbed of at least an Oscar nomination! Shows just how bizarre Hollywood can be sometimes.
I would strongly urge for anybody to see this film. Buckle up and enjoy the ride as it will get bumpy but it will be unfortunately a realistic BUMP!",1115856000,,880,4.438271604938271
2230565,4,B0007PID84,"Upon seeing the previews of this film i could see that it was quite unique in a disturbing way. I was a little reluctant at first thinking it would tend to glorify Child Molesters in some way, glad i was wrong. Even though it shows Kevin Bacon being given a second chance at his life he still goes through hell(as CM's all should,or be dead in my opinion). Kevins acting is superb in that he wants no pity, and the signs that what he has done will ever be erased from his memory, it totally haunts him. Another good quality is that no one feels sorry for him, Mos Def, who plays the cop watching his every move simply states ""your a piece of S#%T and i could through you out that window right now"" in which Kevin Bacon cries. So no Machoism, no Ego, only guilt, rage, confusion and temptation are all that's left, which makes for a very convincing film. People will probably say that ""murderer's, rapist's, and child molester's are all just people"". But i say all the ones that they've ""murdered, raped, and molested are(were)all people too.""",1115683200,,1042,4.460732984293194
2230566,5,B0007PID84,"This 2004 film is as timely as today's headlines.  And it was with that in mind that I watched this slowly unfolding character study of a pedophile who has just been released from prison after twelve years.  Kevin Bacon is cast as Walter in this very difficult and demanding role.  He has returned to his hometown and wants to rehabilitate himself.  But his own sister refuses to see him and his brother-in-law tries to befriend him but will not let him meet his 12-year old niece.

Walter has been given a job at a lumber yard and keeps to himself, arousing the curiosity of his co-workers.  One is a woman, played by Kyra Sedgwick, who is attracted to him and soon winds up in his bed.  Their romance blossoms but he is still aware of his attraction to little girls.  Unfortunately, his apartment overlooks a schoolyard and he watches the children every day and finds himself following little girls in the mall and on the street.  Eventually, he even follows one into a wooded area.  The scene is full of tension as we watch their interaction.

Mos Def is cast as a policeman who visits Walter regularly, saying nasty things about how people like Walter always wind up back in jail. It's an excellent role and he plays it just right.  We love him and hate him at the same time, understanding where he is coming from too.  There is also another co-worker, played by Eve, who doesn't like Walter and discovers his secret on the internet.

We learn Walter's history as he visits his therapist who has also suggested that Walter keep a diary.  While keeping this diary he notices a man hanging around the schoolyard and enticing young boys with candy.

How this all plays out is the stuff of good drama and excellent directing.  I was totally involved in the story and the complexities of the characters.  The crafting was excellent, with not a wasted word or unnecessary scene.

This is not a film for everybody.  There are certainly parts of it that will make you queasy.  But it is excellent drama in every sense of the word.  Highly recommended.",1115510400,,2047,4.581267217630854
2230567,4,B0007PID84,"This was a good film.  Kevin Bacon did a wonderful job in this picutre, he did something that I think most actors would have a major problem with...playing the part of a sex offender.  The film really put you in the mind of a sex offender, and in some respects made you understand them and their victims a little better.  To say the least, this is by far a feel good movie.  You should go into it, knowing that you are going to walk away, angry, confused, and upset. Kudos to Kevin!!",1115424000,,483,4.217391304347826
2230568,4,B0007PID84,"The Woodsman does an excellent job of portraying pedophilia as an addiction. Kevin Bacon creates a multifaceted character, a believable person with a severe problem rather than an irreparable monster. At the same time, commentary from supporting characters keeps the film from painting child molestation in any kind of positive light. A police officer in particular, played by Mos Def, tells Bacon's character about his gut-wrenching experiences with other pedophiles. Overall, seeing this movie was an extremely worthwhile experience. Some parts of the film are difficult to watch, but if you stick it out, The Woodsman presents an insightful perspective on an unpleasant topic.",1115164800,,679,5.538461538461538
2230569,4,B0007PID84,"I expected this to be a really slow, somber film requiring concentration and effort to watch but despite the dark subject matter it was very absorbing from the outset.  First time director Nicole Kassell proves herself to be naturally adept at capturing and holding the viewer's attention with skillful camera work and film editing, the setting is somber but the film still moves with an easy grace and spark from one scene to the other.  Kevin Bacon really does give a spectacular performance, as does the other characters especially the little blonde girl in the park whom he accosts and has a pivotal scene with.

Where the film disappoints, and why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars, is that its plot is mostly held together by a string of fortuitous events and coincidences that really tested my credulity, and the more or less happy ending does feel a bit too pat. I would've liked some more special features on the DVD, maybe some statistics on pedophilia---recidivism rates, background info, clinical and psychological viewpoints, etc.

Otherwise it's a brave and truthful film about a very uncomfortable subject...nice to see that it somehow managed to get made these days!  Highly recommend.",1115164800,,1202,4.960199004975125
2230570,4,B0007PID84,"""The Woodsman"" is based on the play by Stephen Fechter which tells the story of a pedophile who struggles to lead a normal life after spending 12 years in prison. The film seems to have touched a nerve in a lot of critics and viewers, because it is sympathetic toward a child molester, although not toward his crimes. This is a startling feature film debut for director Nicole Kassell, who takes on a difficult subject with impressive courage, sensitivity, and discretion.

Walter (Kevin Bacon) has just been released from prison, where he spent 12 years for fondling preteen girls. Shunned by old friends and family, he is reluctantly offered a job at a lumberyard, where he meets Vickie (Kyra Sedgewick), a plainspoken woman with a difficult past of her own. Isolated by years of imprisonment and the community's revulsion, Walter's only relationships are with his brother-in-law Carlos (Benjamin Bratt), Vickie, with whom he begins an affair, his psychologist, and Sergeant Lucas (Mos Def), a local police officer who harasses him. Walter spends a lot of time looking out of his living room window, which, for better or worse, is across the street from an elementary school. He quickly notices that he is not the only one watching the children.

This role is among Kevin Bacon's most outstanding in a long career of impressive character performances. Walter is a man who constantly struggles with a compulsion. He is torn between a very real, but completely unacceptable, emotional need and the need to control his behavior and live a normal life. Walter desperately wants his compulsion to go away. But it never will. The character isn't very talkative, so it's remarkable that Kevin Bacon is able to clearly communicate what's going on in Walter's mind at all times. In his struggle to find a way to live, Walter tempts himself and tests himself, and is sometimes doubtful and sometimes confident of his ability to resist his compulsion.

If Walter's struggle were against substance addiction, he might easily be viewed as heroic. But Walter's compulsion is for molesting children, a considerably less fashionable failing and the object of much hysteria. Whether or not his pedophilia could have been averted in his youth had he made an effort is the subject of another story. But of all the movies about addiction that I have seen, this is by far the most powerful representation of inner struggle that I've seen committed to film. So, yes, Walter's plight is sympathetic. Walter characterizes a certain type of pedophile, however. He isn't a rapist. He isn't a sociopath. He doesn't want to hurt anyone. Brutal predators and child-rapists are an entirely different breed, on which I don't think this film is intended to comment.

The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005): Bonus features include a ""Getting It Made"" (5 minutes) interview with producer Lee Daniels, a theatrical trailer, 1 deleted and 2 extended scenes, and an audio commentary by director Nicole Kassell. This is a good audio commentary in which Kassell provides scene-by-scene analysis of the film, including discussion of structure, characters, themes, locations, and some technical details. Subtitles for the film are available in English.",1114473600,,3206,5.100952380952381

Really though, Kevin Bacon does a great job in this film, and that is the main reason it is worth watching. The movie does seem to sympathize with child molestors though, which is kind of strange, but hey, they say if there's grass on the field, play ball.

Just kidding, you pervert.",1114387200,,340,4.557377049180328
2230572,4,B0007PID84,"This is a film about a former child molester named Walter and the experiences that he faces trying to become a normal person of society again, He tries to start relationships, and feel for a person again. He is struggling, trying to get back into the groove of normal life. He is tattered with temptation, and his inner demons start coming out,  haunting him. He is scorned by everybody around him, He is called a freak, a sick bastard. He is not accepted because of what he had done.

The film, itself, is a breeding ground for conteversy. It is mainly about peodpiles. But, the film doesn't glorirfy peodophiles, It shows that they are human beings, and that they feel what they have done is bad, and they need to change. as you know, The perfomance by Kevin Bacon generated good buzz, and the film slipped under the radar. Kevin Bacon does one of his most complex and brillant performance as Walter. The film is very good, there is some solid direction, and solid shots. The screenplay was pretty good, I felt that the writer wanted to make it creative, and actually show how a former sex offender struggles.

I didn't nesscary love this movie because it really grossed me out that they did a film on this touchy subject. I felt that Kevin Bacon and the director had balls enough to make this film happen. I am glad that they made this film happen, when a former sex offender is close to you, you don't know how to react, and end up disabling your relationship with that person. The film made me sit for a minute after it ended, and I asorbed the shock that it gave, and the tremendous power that it had over me. Overall, I would highly recommend it, but if you don't like touchy sexual subjects like this, I recommend you rent something else.",1114214400,,1746,4.467084639498433
2230573,5,B0007PID84,"Kevin Bacon has had an interesting career to the say the least. In the `80s, he was being groomed as a leading man with Footloose but ended up rejecting these kinds of films in favour of memorable supporting roles in the `90s with the likes of JFK. In recent years, Bacon has gone back and forth from high profile gigs like Mystic River to meatier roles in independent films like The Woodsman.

Kevin Bacon delivers a sensitive, intensely internalized performance. When we see him looking at the school grounds it doesn't take much to figure out what he's thinking about. The veteran actor does an excellent job of showing Walter's internal struggle as he tries to suppress the old urges and temptations. Walter is sick and he knows it. He asks his psychiatrist, ""When will I be normal?"" This could so easily be his mantra throughout the movie. All he wants is to lead a normal life and finally defeat his inner demons.

There is a theatrical trailer.

""Getting it Made"" is not exactly a Making Of featurette but rather an interview with the film's producer, Lee Daniels. He candidly reveals his aversion to the screenplay at first but after meeting with Kassell he agreed to make the movie.

Also included are three deleted scenes, including one where Vickie proposes that she and Walter live together. Another one tries to define the attraction of little girls for Walter. There is some good footage here that shouldn't have been cut.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Nicole Kassell.  This is a very knowledgeable and informative track as Kassell clearly did her homework and it shows in every frame of this movie.

The characters are well-drawn, fully realized with smart dialogue and a deft touch at how the film's sensitive subject matter is depicted. Director Nicole Kassell gives it the proper amount of respect and seriousness that it deserves. There is never a false moment or feeling of mindless sensationalism. The film does a good job of getting inside Walter's head, showing us the world through his eyes and yet it gives insights into both sides: the perpetrator and the victim. It shows how both sides feel and the effects of physical abuse on them. The Woodsman doesn't try to judge Walter; leaving that up to the audience, but it does try to understand him and his sickness. Bacon is more than up for this challenging role with a strong performance in this powerful, yet understated movie.",1113955200,,2424,4.798561151079137
2230574,5,B0007PID84,"It's absolutely consternating to read how other reviewers get important details of the story wrong or don't get the gist of it at all.  Have they really seen this film, or are they just writing reviews based on their personal disgust of the subject matter?  The point of the story is that it's just a story.  It wasn't made to promote pedophilia.  It doesn't directly condemn, but it certainly doesn't condone.  It doesn't preach, but then, it doesn't have to.  You and I know that what Walter did is wrong; even Walter knows what he did is wrong.  He hates himself for what he did and he's trying to change.

The reviewer who complains that there are no ""normal"" men in the film obviously has not watched this film.  Walter's brother-in-law is clearly depicted as a model father who loves his children and who would protect them at all cost.  And Walter's coworkers certainly don't celebrate him when they find out about his past.  And later, when Robin cries at the thought of her father making her sit on his lap, it reminds us that child abuse is unfortunately everywhere; it is not always the result of an encounter with a trenchcoat-wearing stranger.  Finally, there's really no justifying the same reviewer's idiotic comment about Vicki taking in Walter so they can live happily ever after and subsequently have children that Walter can molest.  Where did THAT come from?  Some people just like to bitch, I guess.

First, I have to give my most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kevin Bacon.  After his truly wretched and idiotic ""Hollow Man"", I had dismissed him as just a two-bit actor.  He has redeemed himself a hundredfold with his amazing performance as Walter.  It can't be easy to give such a tortured performance, especially with a subject matter that most of us don't want to think about, let alone deal with.  I, too, am stunned that his performance was never, ever mentioned at Oscar time.

Other reviewers here have given detailed synopses of the plot including, unfortunately, giving away some of the more important story details, so I won't do that here.  I will, however, clarify one reviewer's erroneous comment that Walter raped young girls.  He did not.  He specifically states that he never hurt them.  No, that's not supposed to make us feel better about him, but this is a very important distinction for him.  In his mind, he knows he's a bad man, but he's not THAT kind of bad man.

Well worth watching, this film will remain with you long after you've put the DVD back in its case.  Also worthy of note, check out the featurette on how the film was made to see what the producers and filmmakers had to go through to get this film financed and made.  Truly a labor of love from all involved: even the actors worked for practically nothing.

It's not often that you actually get to see an intelligent American film that is so rich in thought and emotion.  See this movie.  It is indeed a rare gem.",1113868800,,2925,4.632295719844358
2230575,4,B0007PID84,"Other reviews have synopsized this unnerving film already, so I will skip to why this movie is recomended viewing for everyone, especially parents. The point being made is that pedophiles and sexual predators exist in all of our neighborhoods, and these creeps are not necessarily the weirdo who jumps out of a bush in a raincoat. They could be your next-door neighbor, your co-worker, or even the guy who seems to like hanging out in front of the elementary school talking to little boys.

Perhaps most people already know this, and just don't want to think about the frightening ramifications. Others may not want to see such disturbing subject matter because they go to the movies to be ""entertained."" Reality is unavoidable, no matter how much we may want to bury our heads in the sand. These people do exist, and they do horrible things to children. While we don't have to ponder this reality until we're paranoid, knowledge and awareness are powerful tools we can use to keep our children safe.

This movie does not try to elicit sympathy for Kevin Bacon's character, a convicted child molester. In fact, he is quite a despicable individual. Rather, the filmmakers want to show you that he is not a monster, but a human being who may live in your neighborhood, which is of course more terrifying. The scenes depicting the child predator called ""Candy"" tempting and setting up little boys was illuminating and horrifying at the same time. The more we know how these people function, the better equipped we can be in protecting our children.

The scene with Bacon and the little girl in the park is heartbreaking. Bacon gives one of his best perfomances portraying such a loathsome character. Mos Def is very credible in his portrayal of the police sergeant who keeps dropping in on Bacon to ""keep an eye on him."" His sentiments are true to most police officers and having him speak these feelings, no matter how cruel or hateful, is a fine touch of realism.

A bleak, fascinating film that needs to be seen.",1113782400,,2012,4.756446991404012
2230576,5,B0007PID84,"Kevin Bacon gives the performance of a lifetime in ""The Woodsman,"" an astonishingly brave film that confronts an issue few moviemakers have ever had the courage to tackle - pedophilia.  Child molesters have become the true monsters of the modern psyche.  So repelled are we by their behavior that we shun even the most basic attempts to try and ""understand"" them.  For pedophiles violate that most sacred duty adults have of protecting children from harm at any and all costs.  It is for this reason that even the most hardened criminal will often recoil at the actions of a child molester.  It's small wonder, then, that filmmakers have been so reluctant to approach this hyper-sensitive subject.  Who wants to open himself up to all the slings and arrows that will inevitably come flying his way the moment he puts this topic on the screen?  For no matter how evenhanded and subtle the treatment, any writer or director courageous enough to take on the issue will have to face the charge of trying to ""humanize"" those whom it is far easier for the rest of us to continue thinking of as subhuman.  But what price do we pay for such an attitude?  Don't we stand a better chance of overcoming this tragic problem by trying to comprehend the mindset of pedophiles rather than calling them ""monsters"" and, thus, dismissing them out of hand?

Those who made ""The Woodsman"" certainly think so, for they have come up with a finely crafted study that neither sugarcoats the tragic effects of pedophilia nor demonizes the people who commit the act.  Bacon plays Walter, a 45-year-old man who has just been paroled after a twelve-year sentence for molesting two underage girls.  Even though he is wracked with guilt and self-hatred and seems to want to ""change"" his ways now that he`s back on the outside, Walter has, unwisely, chosen to place himself in the way of temptation by renting an apartment directly across the street from an elementary school, where he not only gets a full view of the students there, but also keeps a watchful eye on another pedophile operating the turf.  Walter has also found employment at a local lumber company where he meets a young woman who is strangely attracted to him and who insists on knowing just what the ""secret"" is that has placed such an obvious burden on the man's soul and spirit.  For Walter is a man waging a war on two fronts: one against the outside world that wants to revile rather than understand him, and the other against his own personal demons of temptation, guilt and self-loathing.  It is here where Bacon truly triumphs as an actor, for he never allows us to forget the titanic struggle taking place within this man's tormented psyche.  In every movement, every gesture, every line spoken and unspoken, the pain is there for us to see.

At one point, crushed with the burden of living with this aspect of his character that he himself cannot explain, he breaks down in despair crying ""I am not a monster.""  And he finds ""redemption"" of sorts when he turns on another pedophile, acting out of the same kind of rage that has been vented on him all these years.  It's as disturbing and unsettling a moment for the audience as it is for the character, for we really don't know how we are supposed to react to this incident.  Are we to cheer Walter for performing an act of righteous anger, or are we to see him as a pathetic figure taking his frustrations out on a person who should be eliciting his empathy not provoking his outrage?  Or is it a form of sublimation, lashing out at the part of himself he has come so much to hate?  Indeed, it is this very moral ambiguity, this refusal to see things in black-and-white terms that makes this such a challenging, thought provoking and adult movie.

What is most striking about ""The Woodsman"" is that writer Steven Fetcher and director Nicole Kassell never sensationalize their subject matter.  The tone of the film is moody and subdued throughout, perfectly reflected in the harsh drabness of a working class neighborhood.  Kassell stays primarily focused on Walter as he goes about his business of trying to get through each and every day as best he can.  She also provides a few brilliant touches that demonstrate her skill and artistry as a director.  For instance, in one scene Walter is riding on a bus when he notices a young girl sitting a few seats in front of him.  We see him pull the cord to get off at the next stop.  Then, Kassell gives us a shot of the door opening and closing with no one having walked through it, indicating, in a subtle and oblique way, that Walter has chosen to stay on the bus so he can follow the girl as she gets off at her stop.  Similarly, Kassell keeps the camera inside the bus as we see the girl walking to a nearby park.  For a moment, we are led to believe that perhaps we are seeing all this through Walter's eyes - that he has actually chosen to stay on the bus and not pursue his intended victim.  But then the camera cuts to a shot from outside the bus and we see that Walter, much to our dismay, has, indeed, stepped off.

In addition to Bacon, there are stunning performances from Kyra Sedgwick as Vickie, the girl who sees some value in Walter that others cannot see; Benjamin Bratt as Walter's sympathetic brother-in-law who, Walter believes, may be having sexual feelings for his own 12-year-old daughter; and Hannah Pilkes, as the little girl who may be Walter's next victim.

""The Woodsman"" is probably the first serious attempt to make a thoughtful movie about a child molester since Fritz Lang's ""M"" in 1930.  Those who would accuse ""The Woodsman"" of trying to generate sympathy for pedophiles are probably barking up the wrong tree here, for if the film shows us anything, it is that even a ""reformed"" molester can continue to pose a threat to children, even after he has ""paid his debt to society.""  I suspect that the police officer in the film speaks for a large segment of the population when he wonders aloud why the justice system doesn't just keep such people locked up for the duration of their lives.  It is a measure of the complexity of this problem that the filmmakers seem as conflicted on this matter as the audience is.

And that`s what makes ""The Woodsman"" such a great film in the end.",1113696000,,6259,4.585278276481149
2230577,1,B0007PID84,"Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick star in this very disturbing and dismal film. The movie begins with Walter (Bacon) being released from prison, moving into an apartment, and resuming a job he'd had prior to imprisonment. Walter is a quiet individual who minds his own business, which fascinates the warehouse's receptionist played by hip-hop artist Eve. Though her advances are ignored by Walter, she becomes irate when Walter becomes interested in Vickie (Sedgwick), a fellow employee. And as the old saying goes, hell has no fury as a woman scorned......

As it turns out, Walter is a pedophile; for which he has just completed a twelve-year sentence. To make matters worse, the only apartment that he could find to rent is adjacent to an elementary school, in which he leers constantly and wanders nightly. To make matters really worse, Walter is still attracted to little girls. This attraction / sickness continues to overwhelm Walter throughout the film to the point where he begins to follow random girls around the mall, and through the local park. He eventually gathers the nerve to ask one of these girls to sit on his lap, because in his words, ""It would really make him (Walter) feel good."" Just at the point where you are truly appalled and disgusted by what you think you are going to witness on screen, the film pulls back and Walter tells the girl to good home. Only to find out that her father has already been enjoying having his daughter sit on his lap....... ARE THERE NO NORMAL MEN IN THIS FILM?

To make a long story short, Eve ""outs"" Walter to his fellow employees. His employers, keeps him on the payroll, and says, ""If anyone has a problem with that, they can pick up their paychecks and quit!"" YEAH, like that's going to happen.... And finally the movie ends with Walter packing his stuff and moving in with Vickie. So they can have kids, and Walter won't have to go outside to find suitable prospects to fondle, he'll be able to find them in the comforts of his own home..... MY GOD WOMAN, WAKE UP!!!!

I just have to ask myself, WHY IN THE WORLD WAS THIS FILM EVER MADE? The film made me feel dirty, sickened, aghast, revolted, horrified... and the list goes on. Whatever you do, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM.

2230578,4,B0007PID84,"One of the characters early on in the film calls Walter ""damaged goods"". We can sense that Walter (Kevin Bacon) has some demons in his closet. We know he has just been released from prison after serving 12 years, for what we do not know yet. That is of course assuming you have not heard about the film in advance. I had, but, it's important to try and forget, otherwise you'll be two steps ahead of the film.

 Walter rapped little girls. But, here is the amazing thing Kevin Bacon does with this role, he made me feel sympathy towards him. We may not like Walter's past but somehow, there are scenes when we like Walter. The beauty of the screenplay, which was written by Steven Fechter and first time director Nicole Kassell, is we never see the acts committed by Walter. Why is this good? Because one of the reason we feel anything towards Walter is due to the fact we cannot identify him with the act. There are celebrities who get in trouble with the law, some even face the same charges Walter does, and people stand by these celebrities, why? Because they can't believe these celebrities are capable of such acts, therefore, we cannot believe Walter, who seems like such a nice guy, is capable of such acts.

 Kevin Bacon is someone I've never thought too highly of. But here in ""The Woodsman"" I have to admit he handles the role quite well. It's difficult playing this kind of role and making an audience feel sorry for him because it goes against everything we believe. Having seen Bacon in the role I'm having difficulty thinking of someone else whom could have played the part.

 The director of the film Nicole Kassell is someone I hope continues to make films. Her previous work included a short film called ""The Green Hour"" about a married woman with childern who must come to term with her sexuality. Kassell seems to like movies where characters have dark secrets and must go on living with these demons. She likes soul searching films, luckily so do I. This also leads me to wonder why there are not more female directors. Yes we have Jane Campion (""The Piano""), Jill Spreecher (""13 Conversations About One Thing"") and Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") but none of them are well known. I'm a film major and my classes are dominated with male students. Usually we have at most 5 females in a 25 student class. Why aren't there more women directors?

 The movie co-stars Kyra Sedgwick (Bacon's real life wife), Eve, Mos Def, Benjamin Bratt and David Alan Grier.

 ""The Woodsman"" does a wonderful job dealing with a controversial subject. It doesn't take sides and tell us what to think. We never suggest we should forgive Walter nor does it suggest we should condemn him. It merely shows us the struggle he goes through to try and balance his life and move on. Some of the scenes more harrowing moments deal with Walter and a young girl named Robin. Here we can see the battle going on inside Walter. These are some of the most gripping moments I have seen in a movie because we don't want to see Walter fail. When was the last time we could say we cared so much about such an unlikeable character? Bravo Kevin Bacon!

 Bottom-line: Well paced, well acted, wonderfuly directed film about tough issues. Never preachy. Straight forward and honest, and that's why I like it.",1113609600,,3286,4.598290598290598
2230579,5,B0007PID84,"Stigma of being a known as a pedophile leaves a burnt scare on the forehead of the person, as he or she tries to reenter society.  Even after having been rehabilitated and serving the punishment society leaves no room for error, as every step, every movement of the person is being monitored in fear of the person committing the same crime again.  In prisons, these criminals are locked away in a different section, as even the general convict population despises the convicts that have committed crimes against children.  It is understandable to see how society hates these criminals who prey on the innocent and the dependent.  The Woodsman illustrates how one pedophile is reentering society after a having served 12-years while struggling to understand himself.

Kevin Bacon provides a gutsy performance as Walter (Kevin Bacon), a pedophile on probation, as he tries to find a way to fit into society while being banished.  Walter's family does not want to have anything to do with him, his counselor drives him into deep inner guilt, and a police officer named Sergeant Lucas harasses him in his own home.  Constant fear that people would find out truth grabs Walter, as he is fully aware of the public notion of pedophiles.  However, amidst this dark time Walter meets Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick).  The two of them initiate an intense relationship, yet he also fears what she might think if she finds out about him.

Fear from the society keeps Walter isolated, as if his personal beliefs and notions build tall walls around him protecting him from society.  Occasionally, he gets to look over the wall, as Vickie visits with him.  Nevertheless, Sergeant Lucas keeps him reminded of what people think of him, as his counselor continues to induce additional guilt within him.  Yet, Walter also understands Sergeant Lucas and the counselor, as he is aware of the horror children experience through people such as himself.

The title of the film, The Woodsman, originates from the Grimm Brothers' Red Little Riding Hood, as it refers to the woodsman that saves the little girl from the wolf's stomach.  There is a scene in the film where Walter is in a park and a young girl approaches him.  At this moment, the audience should pay close attention to the color of the girl's jacket, red, referring to the fairy tale previously mentioned.  Cleverly, this film uses the old fairy tale through the mise-en-scene and the dialogue in the film, which displays the sharp script.

The director Nicole Kassell takes a huge chance making a film about such an explosive topic, which many look upon with much hatred and anger.  However, she succeeds in developing the story into something more than a mere illustration of some kind of monster.  Instead, she takes a humane approach, as Walter struggles with his behavior, thoughts, and persona while trying to find a way to fit into society in an acceptable manner.  Aptly, Kassell brings the audience a story about monsters, but also a question of human ambiguity, as life is not as simple as making people either good or bad.  In the end, the audience will have to experience a truly heartbreaking story about a monster trying not to be a monster.",1113523200,,3185,4.859259259259259
2230580,5,B0007PID84,"THE WOODSMAN is the kind of film that took maximum courage to create on behalf of the entire crew - writer Steven Fechter (who wrote the screenplay from his stage play), director Nicole Kassell, the producers, and of course the actors.  So committed to this project that they also produced this wondrous film, Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick also have assumed the leading roles of this controversial drama and in doing so give us the finest performances of their distinguished careers.

We, as society, play a major role in this story because it is very much about how we judge people, how we deal with those who have been incarcerated, and how we hold onto our intolerances for those who are out of the norm.  Placing ourselves in the judgmental role makes the impact of this film that much more devastating.

Walter (Kevin Bacon) has just been released from a 12-year prison term for molesting young girls and returns to his home to find a job in a lumberyard under the careful scrutiny of Bob (David Alan Grier) his boss.  Mary-Kay (Eve) his co-worker tries to come on to him and is rebuffed by Walter, a man who lives in dark loneliness, filled with guilt and self-loathing, afraid to allow any sort of closeness with anyone.  He rents an apartment across from a schoolyard ('the only landlord who would take my money') where he observes from his window the source of his past (and +/- present) temptation - little girls at play. He also observes a young man approaching young boys, mirroring his own history of pedophilia, a view that will permanently alter his self-concept later in the film.

Walter meets Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick), finds it odd that a beautiful woman would be a laborer in a lumberyard of men, and after a time the two share a beer and end up in bed.  Vickie eventually pries out Walter's reason for his incarceration, and while shocked she does not flee but instead shares her darkest secret that her three brothers molested her as a child.

Noting Walter's developing relationship with Vickie, Mary-Kay finds the truth about Walter's past and makes it known to the entire lumberyard in the cruelest of ways. The injured Walter moves in with Vickie, continues seeing his therapist Rosen (Michael Shannon), his brother in law Carlos (Benjamin Bratt), and his parole officer Sgt Lucas (Mos Def), and we slowly learn that Walter has a conflict with his sister with whom he napped as a child 'to smell her hair' (an act coupled with his history of pedophilia that makes his sister refuse to see him despite Carlos' good attempt to re-join them).

Along the way Walter encounters a 12-year-old girl Robin (Hannah Pilkes) who is also a loner and birdwatcher and we are allowed to see how Walter's recidivism surfaces as he longs for physical contact with Robin.  Yet in a sensitive scene between the two, the spectrum of perpetrator and victim is played out solely through words: Walter invites Robin to sit on is lap only to discover that Robin's father has been showing the same behavior and what is communicated between the two is some of the most healing dialogue ever written.

The manner in which this story ends is very much left up to the viewer (remember we are part of the film) to decide.  The pacing of this tale, the minimal dialogue, the quiet of the gritty atmosphere - all of these contribute to the profound effect that is achieved in the brilliant performance by Kevin Bacon.  Rarely has an actor captured the angst, the internalization, the bleakness of injured life after prison, and the longing for redemption that Bacon achieves with his face, his eyes, his body language and his manner of delivering his lines.  Kyra Sedgwick is likewise extraordinarily powerful as the damaged woman who allows her rigid lonely life to embrace the likes of Walter. The supporting cast is uniformly outstanding, especially Hannah Pilkes as Robin, and Benjamin Bratt as Carlos.

This may be the first film for Nicole Kassell but is surely won't be the last.  She is a brilliant director who has mastered her resources and carved a treasure of a film.  One can shout against the awards people for being so intimidated by the subject matter to prevent Kevin Bacon from being crowned for his penultimate achievement, but people forget who won the awards as soon as they are over: people can't forget the power of Bacon's performance.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, April 05",1113436800,,4393,4.770448548812665
2230581,5,B0007PID84,"A superb film. Beautifully written and directed by Nicole Kassell. Kevin Bacon gets better and better with every film he makes. In The Woodsman he turns in an oscar award-winning-performance as the haunted Walter a man attracted to children. Kyra Sedgewick is his equal in both story, as her role of his girl friend, as well as in her equally outstanding portrayal of a young woman with the moral strength to stand up for what she believes. The chemistry between these two is pitch perfect. The film also nails ambiance, location, and the subtext of each of the supporting charcters' lives. In the end we find ourselves rooting for all of them, but for different reasons. This is one of those rare films that leaves you with a sense of hope. The story never lets you down. Instead the message is clear, concise, and stays on point throughout. Finally we  are left to make up our own minds never knowing the exact nature of Walter's crime except that he went to jail for 12 years. But we come away satisfied with a lot to consider such as misplaced justice. And injustice. This is a remarkable viewing experience as good a film as any ever made in America.

2230582,5,B0007PID84,"I think that child molesters are arguably the criminals who are most fortunate the U.S. Constitution has a prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  It is common knowledge that in the prison hierarchy child molesters represent the bottom most rung.  How many times have you heard about pedophiles who are released from serving time in prison and communities be outraged to discover there is a convicted sex offender in their neighborhood?  Another part of conventional wisdom, those things that everybody knows regardless of the facts, it that child molesters are never cured.  However, findings indicate that sex offender treatment reduces the likelihood of sexual recidivism to only 10 (those who do not go through treatment have a recidivism rate of 17 percent).  In other words most pedophiles do not repeat their offense and experts agree that with successful completion of a specialized treatment program those who sexually abuse children can learn how to control their actions.

Such statistics certainly surprised me, but I kept them in mind while watching ""The Woodsman.""  The title character is Walter (Kevin Bacon), who has spent a dozen years in prison for molesting young girls.  Of course, by the time this 2004 film came out on DVD this week the character Bacon was playing in this film was pretty well known, but make an effort to notice how the character is established before his crime is revealed.  There are plenty of clues that clearly indicate it, and we know from the start he is an ex-con, but director Nicole Kassell knows how the cards are stacked against pedophiles and wants the audience to be sympathetic at least toward Walter's plight.  He knows what he did is wrong, is disgusted by his behavior, and wants to be ""normal.""  He is clearly making an effort to go straight, which is exactly what society demands, and we are supposed to at least endorse the effort even if we despise the person making the effort.

However, going straight is not going to be easy.  The only place that will rent an apartment to an ex-con is across the street from an elementary school and the cop (Mos Def) who comes by to check on him in anticipation of Walter making the same mistake knows this is not a good sign.  His brother-in-law (Benjamin Bratt) comes by to visit but makes it clear Walter's sister wants nothing to do with him.  When Walter is in therapy it becomes clear she is the source of his pathology, so we can hardly blame her.  Meanwhile, when Walter looks out his window at the schoolyard and sees a suspicious man hanging around the schoolyard giving candy to young boys.  At works things are almost manageable.  Walter worked there before his arrest and the son of the previous owner (David Allan Greer) hires him.  The office assistant (Mary-Kay) is suspicious of Walter, but Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick), who drives a forklift, is attracted to him.  Of course, she does not know his secret, although clearly he has one.  Then there is Robin (Hannah Pilkes), the young girl who rides the same bus he takes home from work and who gets off to work in the park.

We know that Walter is going to come to a crisis point in his life and that it could go either way.  That doubt is essential to the film and it is carried off not only Kassell's screenplay of Steven Fechter's play, but mostly by Kevin Bacon's performance.  He was overlooked in ""Mystic River"" while co-stars Shawn Penn and Tim Robbins were (deservedly) winning Oscars for their performances and he was overlooked for what he did in this film, which is being universally acclaimed as his best.  Bacon's film career might be a game but his acting is certainly not a joke and I do not think that anybody who has followed his career are really surprised by his performance here.  ""The Woodsman"" comes down to a scene in the park and a moment where Bacon's face is wonderfully transformed by a surprising revelation.  The script crafts the moment, but it is Bacon who carries it off.

The DVD only has three deleted/extended scenes but two of them are extremely interesting in terms of the decisions that were made on the final cut of this film.  One makes explicit the implicit reasons why Vickie chooses to be with Walter (implicit is better) and the other provides a significant variation on the pivotal scene between Walter and Robin.  I was wondering why Walter did not do something along the lines of what he does in this alternative version, which would have changed the final act of the film considerably.  I would have loved to have heard the conversation where they made the decision to go the way they did in the finished film, but you can still meditate on what differences this would have made in how everything played out.  It is worth thinking about.",1113264000,,4756,4.7272727272727275

2230585,4,B0007PID84,"""The Woodsman"" is a riveting, disturbing character study of a pedophile named Walter (Kevin Bacon), a 40-something man recently released from prison after molesting young girls. The film focuses on adjustments that Walter and the people around him must make.

Walter is a lonely man when he leaves prison. His family wants nothing to do with him. His co-workers at the lumberyard eye him suspiciously, and some loathe him openly. His apartment is ironically located across the street from an elementary school, a location that both torments and calms him as he tries to come to grips with what he did. His only friend is a brother-in-law (Benjamin Bratt), a man who is awkward to talk to.

Walter's sickness - his disposition to wanting young girls - pervades his mind at all hours of the day, and even though he officially is exonerated and on his own (aside from his probation), he knows his perverse desire still resides within him.

Bacon gives a great performance. It's a risky performance (most actors would probably shy away from a pedophiliac character), but he handles it deftly, displaying a mixture of leveled anger, sadness and pain that makes it hard to like or dislike him. Walter isn't a character we can root for, and his momentary pitfalls into pursuing little girls is absolutely chilling, but he seems human and sympathetic in certain ways. He isn't a caricature. He sits between being a monster and a human being, and Bacon's portrayal is superb.

The performances are fantastic all around. Mos Def shows once again that he is a gifted actor, playing a cop who checks up on Walter every now and then. The scenes between Walter and him display some of the finest acting of any independent film this year. Kyra Sedgwick, playing one of Walter's coworkers, also is excellent.

The Woodsman maintains a high level of suspense through its 90-minute running time. Each character gives an emotionally complete, well-rounded performance so that every action is believable. The contentious subject of pedophilia is handled brilliantly, and there are scenes that will stay with you for days. This is a great film, and a laudable achievement in writing and acting.",1111536000,,2173,4.942465753424657
2230586,4,B0007PID84,"This is the debut film for new director Nicole Kassell. She had seen Steven Fechter's play, THE WOODSMAN, and bought the film options immediately. She and Fechter collaborated on the screenplay. It won the screenplay competition at Sundance in 2001. Somehow she brought the project to Kevin Bacon, and he liked it, accepting the role of executive producer. He and his wife Kyra Sedgewick became involved, and those Hollywood fiscal doors swung open.

Consequently, Kassell was able to direct with remarkable confidence, and a decent budget. As a female director, she is finding her place at the table of Cinema Arts. At Sundance this year, 25% of the films had female directors. She has directed a powerful drama that might be a tough sell commercially.

Kevin Bacon gave a strong performance as Walter, playing a paroled pedophile, returned to the mean streets after twelve years of incarceration. It is hinted at that he must have hidden his crime for all that time, and therefore had no rehab or counseling. He returned to his old job, at a lumberyard, and set up a relationship with a tough cop parole officer, played masterfully by Mos Def, and a pyschological counsellor. Walter knows that he wears the label of deviant, and that his difficult to control urges were like demons shackled with silken scarves. His pedophilia was with young girls. That story is not usually told. It was brave of Kassell to tackle it with her first feature film.

Bacon played Walter as taciturn, walking and working like a tense shadow. He was not receptive to other employess getting to know him. He was a man walking on eggshells that to him felt like running barefoot over broken glass. He would inhabit a scene like a piece of furniture--one saw him but didn't notice him. He kept everything in check--every muscle, every twitch, every inflection and intonation. Like an animal that has been caged and whipped, and degraded, when it is finally set free, its tail spend a long time between its legs.

He hoped to make it, even though the odds were against him. Over 90% of pedophiles reoffend and return to prison and certain death. But after a misunderstanding at work, his dark secret was revealed, his cover was blown--and everyone began to treat him like a pariah. Everyone except his co-worker Vickie, played by Kyra Sedgewick. She was beginning a relationship with him, physical and emotional, and she had revealed her own problems--her three brothers had used her like a sex toy as she grew up. So she pulled away too, for a while. But in the end, she was willing to stand with Walter against the world; very romantic, albeit unrealistic. Sedgewick was wonderful in the role, sexy, strong, yet still vulnerable.

The plot was rife with coincidences, but the acting was so strong, we accepted them, and went along for the whole ride.

Benjamin Bratt was very effective as the brother-in-law Carlos,who wanted to help Walter--that is until Walter said an inappropriate thing about Carlos' daughter.

At one point, stressed out and desperate, Walter stalked and followed a young girl into the park. Hannah Pilkes played Robin, the 12 year old girl. Her simplicity, clarity, and sadness seemed to leap off the screen. This was her film debut, and she stole the film in a very pivotal scene.

In the end, we are not allowed closure--only the faintest glimmer of hope. As Roger Ebert wrote,"" Clearly, it is not the pedophile that is evil--it is the pedophilia. ""  This is a powerhouse of a film--a must see for everyone who likes drama mixed with fable, doused with depression, fueled by anger, and cleansed by tears.",1108598400,,3608,4.834683954619125
2230587,5,B0007PID84,"At least, at times. Kevin Bacon genuinely deserves an Oscar for his tremendous and very complex, richly layered portrayal of a pedophile. Obviously, this movie is dark and not upbeat...but deserves to be seen.

  Early on, it is clear that Bacon has just gotten out of prison, convicted of ""molesting girls"". Serving time hasn't cured him of his problem and he struggles with recurring impulses as well as his own self-hatred. He goes to a therapist and tries to work through his feelings. There is a huge part of him that wants to change - but can he?

  At this point, I hesitate to give away too much of the plot, other than to say that there are struggles with fitting into the community, conflicting desires and so much more. One of the best...and also one of the darkest...films of the year.",1107388800,,797,4.577464788732394

Kyra Sedgwick, Mos Def, and Eve all perform extraordinarily well and are all utterly convincing in their roles as well.  The directing by Nicole Kassell was dead-on from start to finish.  All of that being said, I found the film content and script so incredibly disconcerting that I could scarcely bare to finish the movie.

That is, after all, a true testament to the cast at pulling off their roles such a disturbingly convincing manner.  The Woodsman, however, is just not a movie that I would ever want to see again.",1106870400,,704,4.729508196721311
2230589,5,B0007PID84,"I have been anticipating to see ""The Woodsman"" for sometime now. I finally caught the afternoon matinee and loved it. This film was very subtle and didn't adhere to your typical introduction, suspenseful build-up and climatic ending. The film was intense yet subtle.

Kevin Bacon puts in an amazing performance as Walter, a pedophile who was recently released from prison. He is trying to start a new life after serving 12 years for molesting a few young girls (I was under the impression that it was three but I could be wrong). Unfortunately the only apartment that he could get was across the street from a elementary school. This alone tests Walter and his inner demons. Real-life spouse Kyra Sedgewick puts in a equally wonderful performance as Walter's girlfriend/co-worker Vickie. Despite knowing Walter's past, she still wants to be with him and eventually opens up to him about her troubled past.

The cameo appearances by Eve, Mos Def, David Alan Grier, and Benjamin Bratt were excellent. I wish that there was a bit more of David Alan Grier as Walter's boss but otherwise their presence in the film were just as compelling as the lead characters. I wasn't too impressed by the cameo appearance by Madonna's ex-boyfriend Carlos Leon as Pedro. His acting abilities is something to be left desired. The stand out performance by the following actors had to be Mos Def. Mos Def's performance as Sgt. Javert who is constantly up Walter's grill, especially when something bad happens in the neighborhood.

I have to give major points to director Nicole Kassell for tackling a very uncomfortable, if not ugly subject which is pedophilia. The subject matter is definitely not for the squeamish. The cinematography was very gritty which matched well with the subject. The way the film was edited was excellent and conveyed to this moviegoer the torment that Walter was experiencing.

My only flaw I found with the film is the way that Walter's past was handled. I did not like being given snippets of a young girl and the red rubber ball that I used to play dodgeball with in elementary school. I understood that it was part of Walter's past but I think I would have liked to have known a little more or had just left it out altogether.

The best qualities about this film is how Nicole treated her lead characters Walter and Vickie. They were flawed, wounded souls to say the very least but at the same time they were human and trying to make their way through life . By all means, Nicole certainly doesn't paint pedophilia in a positive light. She makes it very clear that pedohpilia is wrong but she at the same time wants to show the moviegoer what a convicted pedophilia goes through when he is re-integrated with society after serving prison time. It ain't a pretty picture but it certainly gave me some insight to what a convicted child molester goes through in society.

After Kevin's stunning performance in 2003's ""Mystic River"", I didn't think he could put in an even better performance but he did here in ""The Woodsman"". Like wine, Kevin Bacon just keeps getting better and better with age.",1106352000,,3103,4.779850746268656
2230590,5,B0007PID84,"Wow. I've read the other reviews here and people have covered the film plot, etc.

This movie is hands down was the most painful for me to watch EVER. I was uncomfortable from start to finish. That said, I could not take my eyes off Kevin Bacon. This is a brave and unflinching, ungentle movie, and I applaud him for not only taking the role but slipping so seamlessly into it, which is - in a word - more than freaky. Most of the time I didn't even recognize him.

In the scene at the bar, Walter makes shapes with the linen napkin. As he suddenly pops up a white linen bunny with his first smile of the film, I realize this is probably one of the ways he lures or grooms his victims and I was suddenly in the mind and inner workings of a pedophile. I did NOT like being in there. But it happened again throughout the film. When he has Kyra's character sitting on his lap, the waves of nausea went right through me.

I'd also like to address the review that talked about an implausible moment in the park with the little girl. Not to invalidate or disrespect the opinion, but I actually found it quite believable and I too was in the social service field for many years, working with rape and incest survivors. First off, I knew as soon as she so willingly talked with him and most especially when she agreed to sit on his lap that she had boundaries that were lost in her victimization. Second, his response to realizing this did in fact seem realistic to me - and did not mean that he was in any sense a more enlightened man because of it - just that, because it was not him but someone else, he could see the abuse clearly and it was enough of a jolt to force him back to awareness of what he was about to do.  I hope that makes the same sense in typed words that it does in my head.

This is the hardest film to recommend for viewing. On the one hand, the acting, the directing, the incredible attention to detail, is superb and really shouldn't be missed in times of so many mediocre films. But on the other hand, how do I recommend to friends and loved ones that they allow their guts to be ripped open, perhaps triggers to get triggered, and invite such an intense moment of pain into their lives that may well haunt them for a long time?",1106265600,,2246,4.189814814814815
2230591,5,B0007PID84,"As I left the theater, I thought to myself: How am I going to write this review? This movie needs to be experienced, to be felt. Then when I looked at the other reviews here on Amazon, I saw that the ""experiences"" were already covered in detail, so I decided that gave me some leeway.

This is a film about a pedophile, and the struggles he experiences after his release from prison, both with the people in his life and the emotions that boil inside of him. My review is going to focus mainly on the specific events involving him and his pedophilia.

Many viewers likely have difficulty separating the fiction of the movie from the reality of the horrors of child molestation, which probably explains its dismal rating (currently 5.6 out of 10) on pro.imdb.com (the professional version of the Internet Movie Database). They probably feel disgust - and they *should* feel disgust. There is no worse crime than stealing the life of a child. This film was also shunned by the Golden Globes, which means it will likely receive no nods from the Academy, which is much more conservative. That is a pity, because at the very least Kevin Bacon puts on an amazing performance deserves at least a nomination.

Walter (Bacon) is acutely aware of his disease, and he despises himself for it. One can see it in the self-hatred in his eyes, and in the gruff manner in which he treats others. The gruffness, however, probably arose from spending twelve years in prison, where even amongst criminals there is a code of honor: murder, rape, thieve all you want - just never, ever molest a child. While it's never discussed, we can assume that Walter himself was horrifically abused during those twelve years.

Somewhat unbelievably, upon Walter's release from prison, he secures an apartment that is directly across from an elementary school, although it is explained that no other landlord would take his money. His brother-in-law brings him a table, which Walter made as a wedding present for his sister and brother-in-law. Carlos (Benjamin Bratt) says that he's returning it to please his wife. We understand that means that Walter's sister has such hatred, disdain, and an inability to forgive him that she wants nothing of his in her house. Walter places the table in front of a window that overlooks the school's playground, where he either watches, or writes in a journal, which his therapist encouraged him to do. In that journal he speaks of his continuing struggle with his attraction to young girls - and also the very conspicuous stalking of an obvious child molester who is interested in boys. Walter records him in his journal as ""candy"", and one wonders why Walter doesn't immediately turn him in. He certainly has the opportunity, as he has assigned parole as well as a Sergeant that visits him from time to time to make him feel who takes it upon himself to make Walter feel even worse about himself. Perhaps Walter never turned on ""candy"" because he still found himself entranced by young girls. That is understandable, even if it is disgusting and revolting.

We also know that he is aware of his abnormality because he speaks of it to his therapist, saying on repeated occasions that he wants to be normal - and normal for him means ""looking at a girl and not..."" He leaves it at that, but we know what he means. He wants desperately to look at a girl - between the ages of 10 and 12 - and have no desires for her.

Although never directly discussed in the film, there is a scene with his therapist that very strongly suggests a sexual relation between him and his sister, and this likely explains his very specific age range. The therapist asks for his first recollection of sexual feelings, and Walter describes an event where he was taking a nap with his sister and smelling her hair. He was six, and she was four. Walter repeated several times that he enjoyed smelling her hair. The therapist asked him how this progressed over time, and when the age that the therapist approached began to touch on the limits of the girls Walter molested, Walter began to cry and ultimately refused to continue. One can only imagine what took place between the two of them, but whatever it is, Walter's self-reproach is plain. It's also one of the best acted spots in the film.

Walter takes the bus to work, and the bus serves as a catalyst for two things. First, a relationship with a woman (played by Kyra Sedgwick, Bacon's wife) who herself was sexually abused by her brothers when she was younger. When she shares that with Walter, he says to her, ""You must hate them"". Her reply explains her relationship with him: ""No, I love all of them"". How she found the ability to forgive them we never know. These situations are complicated.

Second, a young girl rides the bus that he finds attractive. One day he doesn't get off at his stop and he follows her into a park where she's looking at birds. He strikes up a conversation with her, and it's very difficult as an audience member to watch this dialogue. Part of you can't help but care about Walter, because even though you know he has molested young girls (and therefore a part of you loathes him), you see the burning desire for redemption within him and you want him to succeed at becoming ""normal"". The girl breaks off the conversation and leaves, but not uncomfortably - in fact, she seems very comfortable with him. Nevertheless, Walter wears his guilt like the weight of a galaxy on his shoulders, and he slumps home.

A jealous girl who he originally shunned found out that he was a child molester, and started distributing flyers around the lumberyard where he works with his picture and the nature of his offense. The guys jump on him, he gets slugged a time or two in the gut, and while he originally goes on the floor to work, he walks off early, and finds himself back in the park where he talked to the birdwatcher. He sits on a bench, ostensibly waiting for her to come, and eventually she does, sitting down beside him. Then begins the most uncomfortable part of the film. After some conversation, Walter asks her age (that's part of his M.O. - establish their age), and then asks if she wants to sit on his lap. You can almost hear the collective groan in the theater when he asks this, because you can feel him slipping away into the darkness of his disease again - and we know that if he molests this girl, or even if he is seen sitting next to her, never mind with her on his lap, that he is going back to jail. She says no, and a look of regret and longing wash over Walter's face. Then he asks if her Daddy lets her sit in his lap. She says yes, and he asks if she likes it. And here's the surprise: she says no, and starts to cry.

I'm going to leave it at that, because that in itself is divulging too much of what I feel needs to be experienced. The only other thing I'll say is that the sergeant who is assigned to him shared with him a metaphor earlier in the film, that of the woodsman from Little Red Riding Hood. The woodsman was the character who cut Little Red Riding Hood out of the wolves belly.

The girl on the bus, the birdwatcher, wore a red cape-like jacket.",1106006400,,7145,4.5310077519379846
2230592,4,B0007PID84,"It has been said that all the power in the world resides in the eyes. After Kevin Bacon's performance in The Woodsman, if that theory held true Kevin Bacon would be a God. After being forgotten it seems for Mystic River, Kevin Bacon just might get that recoginition that everyone else in Mystic River got. The Woodsman is a gripping tale of a man, Walter, who has been released from prison after committing child molestation. He is reserved but you can tell theres a lot of inner turmoil and demons.

This movie is based on Kevin Bacon's character through and through. The camera angles, the score, and the setting just all complament this man Walter. Bacon puts together a performance of a lifetime which says a lot for such an actor. He is very tensed and uncomfortable throughout the movie to show that not all emotions aren't on the outside, but tension from the inside. All of his performance is best showcased by one thing: His eyes. Every situation you can see his feelings, his addictions, his destruction just through his eyes. You can even see his most tranquil setting are those when he is with a little girl Robin. Kyra Sedgwick does a phenomenal job playing the one person, Vicki, that believes Walter is a decent human being. At first, you just see her as this sex addicted woman looking for a screw, but as you dig deeper you come to find her family history puts her this way. Her and Walter's relationship is built the needing of each other because beside themselves they are alone. Mos Def plays Sgt. Lucas who is a hard cop with that specific disgust towards pedafiles. His performance while brief still makes an impact. The same can be said with Benjamen Bratt's presence as Walter's brother in law.

The script does exactly what it sets out to do which is to dig under one's skin. Each moment of Walter being near a girl you almost just wanna scream out ""NO!!!!! RUN WALTER RUN AWAY!!"". This script makes you squirm and twists in your seat which is the purpose anyways.

In closing, I have to say I haven't been that uncomfortable in a movie since Se7en, but as much as I was intrigued I don't believe it was be nominated for Best Picture. I will say it would be a disgrace if Kevin Bacon goes unnoticed in nominations. Even Kyra Sedgwick and Mos Def could garner up nods for their roles.",1105401600,,2308,4.5299760191846525

They describe the nature of many of these types of people as covert,  aggressive , predatory and ""Without Conscience"".  The specifically warn against buying into certain social distortions which provoke sympathy in a person of normal healthy conscience. I do agree that pedophiles have a very very difficult series of challenges when they are released from prison and i also  believe that there needs to be more structured resources and programs upon release from prison.

There may be the rare pedophile who has had a genuine breakthrough and does have some level of conscience but it doesn't represent the norm.  Those rare pedophiles that have completely repented and are committed to a moral existence are certainly worthy of social acceptance and forgiveness but there has to be solid evidence of change over a long period of time.",1525392000,,1595,5.011363636363637
8050250,1,B0007PID84,"Filthy movie with a tunnel perception full of sexual inuendos. Everything revolves around sex and being molested. Its so unrealistic. The characters are wooden and the dialogue is dull. This movie had no redeeming quality and just went nowhere. Things just happened for no reason and the movie just continued to drown in its own filth. It also left some unanswered questions. What a waste of time. I love Kevin Bacon, but  not this movie.",1525305600,,438,4.84
8050251,1,B0007PID84,"Like many other perversions which have become normalized in our culture... this propaganda piece is the first step in that direction for pedophilia. It tries to portray this un-rehabilitated perpetrator, (Bacon), as a misunderstood victim of society. I wish I never found or watched it.",1525219200,,286,5.377777777777778
8050252,5,B0007PID84,"Well done movie. I would normally stay away from films like this one because life is hard enough as it is, if I want to cry my eyes out I can watch the news. But this film was worth watching. It approached a hard topic seriously, soberly. No one wants to talk or think about childhood sexual abuse, no normal person anyway, but its happening all around us. Predators, those wanting to change like the character in the movie, those desperately looking for the next victim, those trying to convince themselves that there are no victims, they are a reality, and no predator has a sign on his forehead saying beware- so, the longer those who can protect children bury their heads in the ground because the topic is too upsetting to our sensibilities, the more vulnerable our children become, as if they were not already. I guess some reviewers interpreted this film as trying to excuse the main characters behavior, that was not my conclusion. I saw a man battling himself, hating himself, realizing, against his will almost, that all the b.s. hed told himself in the past (I never hurt them) is that: a load of B.S.  The film did an excellent job of showing how common this is, while we try really hard not too look its happening under our noses, its a person outside a school casually talking to children, three brothers looking at their sister, a father asking his daughter to sit on his lap ... Id advocate for fewer sensibilities and more awareness and I think thats what this film tried to do.",1525219200,,1495,4.557620817843866
