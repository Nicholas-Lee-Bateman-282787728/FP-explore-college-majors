I will try to write this without spoilers..

For those who like regular mainstream you can guess what will happen romantic comedies, this is not for you....

Search is extremely deep work of art on many levels.

Lisa (Amanda Ooms, Everlasting Moments) is 38 and single in Stockholm. She goes through a series of events which lead us to her finding something or trying to find something. She touches on past loss, desire for children, mental illness, pain, emptiness, some self-pity, selfishness, and also love and care. She is symbolized by many elements including what she wants the most...

The screenplay is wonderful.

Still, the film uses the Search ""concept"" as a tool to lighten a very heavy subject matter. Most likely the concept was needed to allow this film to be green-lit by Swedish film studio's. All other reviews I found on Swedish websites only talked about the concept. Another interesting piece of this puzzle is that the ""concept"" which lightens things up (adding a mainstream commercial element to those parts of the film), that same good old ""concept"" also shows the female writer-director's incredible understanding of men. Maybe she writes from personal experiences in the world of being single, maybe she gained this perspective from being a keen listener. For example Kalle (in one scene only) is like a guy I know, whom I am not proud to be acquainted with (You haven't seen my sailboat). She nails this character. I mean nails him.

The concept is a gimmick to tell the story that needed to be told. It is the centerpiece the the film's promotion. The trailer I found on youtube.com sells the film as a romantic comedy.

The film opens with a warm small connected moment, and then uses musical composition to exude a feeling which we cannot place, but we know its real, its art. Then Search takes us into a mainstream-like group scene/moment. Then becomes a work of small independent film art again. Then it takes off for ups in energy and downs in the doldrums until about 50 minutes in.

The first 50 minutes take us in and out of funny, light hearted and serious scenarios while one mysterious person strikes a chord with Lisa. One scene will be funny, the next will exude some very deep human relations (maybe society is conditioned to explosions and shootouts and car chases in films and its easy for us to miss how much more powerful these situations really are).

Lisa's best friend is Vera (Lia Boysen, When Darkness Falls (A DISTURBING MUST SEE)). Vera has her own romantic ties which are wrong, but oh so very right. Vera is a grounded, talented media type who has weakness for one situation. Vera's relationship leads us to a couple of the film's powerful moments. These are those honest situations which are born from Swedish filmmakers (in general?) ability to understand the human condition in everyday life. I know everyone frequently mentions Ingmar Bergman, but his ability to capture real feelings in everyday moments is (maybe) something inherited by some Swedish filmmakers.

Vera's scenes with Madeleine (Pernilla August, Star Wars: Epidsode I - The Phantom Menace, Fanny & Alexander) are so connected in reality, that I am extremely pleased they were not written as over the top moments. Madeleine's profession does not allow for her to have emotional reactions. Still, her love and the life she built is being undermined and Lisa and Vera have scene's with Madeleine which showcase master actors and master direction in film making. Again, these scenes are kept so very tasteful and simple in nature, maybe some viewers can pass over these scenes as nothing that deep. They must place themselves in Madeleine, Vera, and Lisa's shoes to feel the gravity. This kind of film making is what greatness is. Also Swedish people (traditionally have handled themselves with a more non-confrontational dignity, that is changing, as is Sweden with the world moving in. Maybe Sweden is much more confrontational now).

It is easier to make a fast paced film with car chases, explosions, funny smooth lines and slick technology then to make something REAL!

Also in this film is (quickly becoming world famous) Mikael Persbrandt (""Everlasting Moments"" (Masterpiece), and Masterwork ""A Better World"" (Academy Award & Golden Globe Winner for Best Foreign Film) as Bjorn. His power on screen is undeniable. This is an example of the phrase ""There are no small roles, only small actors"". Bjorn appears sporadically throughout the film. There is a hospital scene which the musical and visual composition changes when the camera faces us up to him (Lisa's POV) and we know he is a A SPECIAL MAN. He was booked by Ingmar Bergman in some (later in Bergman's life) stage plays, therefore that is all we need to know about his talents (because Bergman had the greatest eye for talent). Bjorn carries his weight, he was perfectly cast. He opens and closes the show with POWER.

Also the wonderful actor Johan Rabaeus (Evil. Swedish: Ondskan) plays David and lights up the screen in his limited screen time. He and Vera have a simple scene in a cafe waiting for Bjorn and he states some simple (but major) feelings about his life and love. Wow, he has carries his scenes with effortless internal projection. His work is so very powerful, yet its so simple, maybe the women actors in Search are thinking, wow, guys have it so very easy because they make a simple gesture and it comes off so very cool and powerful and we have to break down to have that kind of moment! Not true, because the ladies carry the show and the men are complimentary.

Another great Swedish Actor Leif Andree (Johan) plays a part which in the last 1/3rd of this film he goes from a fun, lively spirit to VERY DEEP. He showcases his range.

When things GO OFF late in this film, they are extreme.

Amanda Ooms (Lisa) is perfectly cast as the lead. As a man, I am VERY HAPPY to see a strong film with female leads and real situations. No explosions except of the heart, with emotions and feelings coming from life. Lisa's character is 38 and still going through those frustrations of being single in the big city. She carries some baggage inside. She has some other things wrong.

When a man loves a woman, gosh darn, he loves her!

****

This (Swedish) film is written and directed by Maria von Heland (Big Girls Don't Cry. Big Girls Don't Cry is a German film which is quite excellent with an amazing soundtrack). Ms. von Heland has a great view of the world. She sees human interaction and life in a very realistic way. Yet she can play a little bit and be humorous. Her timing, art direction, dialogue and accompanying musical compositions wonderfully compliment the world she is bringing us into.

The soundtrack is WONDERFUL

One song ""Swan Song is my new favorite (I go for the danger, sit out across the sand..) I cannot find this song anywhere.

Also the concept added a few cameo's by famous figures in Sweden. Other then one world famous Swedish actor, most people outside of Sweden will not know who these people are.

****

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because of the light hearted breaks in between serious drama (due to the concept). Ingmar Bergman would have found a way without the concept. He would have made this film serious from the start to finish, still Svensk Filmindustri allowed him to do anything he wanted after the success of Sommarnattens leende (aka Smiles of a Summer Night) (therefore that comparison is not fair).

****

As an American Swedish speaker, its hard to get Swedish films in America. I appreciate that Amazon.com is making films like this available through their own distribution channels in conjunction with Trust Nordisk out of Denmark. Sadly, I cannot get the subtitles off the screen. But, I will take it!

Sweden is a country of maybe 10,000,000 people, yet this land produces incredibly high quality film work from Bergman to Troell..
