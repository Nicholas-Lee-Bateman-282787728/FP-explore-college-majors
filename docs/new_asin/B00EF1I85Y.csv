8604898,5,B00EF1I85Y,This is one of the better first doctor stories I have seen.  And this is a region b dvd so you need a all region dvd or 3d blu ray player to see this.  But notice that the price is much cheaper on the euro discs than here. This has lots of extras and such.  This is the first cybermen story too.  The last episode is animated and that 's a good thing.,1471564800,,351,3.767123287671233
8604899,5,B00EF1I85Y,"I thought this was a great story even though the Cybermen costumes were extremely crude compared to later stories.,

The fourth episode was animated (as was the regeneration) but the extras include the VHS reconstructed version of the fourth episode put together with stills and surviving unremastered clips so you can at least see the real regeneration.

I felt that William Hartnell did well in his last story as the first Doctor. Considering his ill health and that he really didn't want to leave, he didn't let it effect his performance.

This story was important to the canon of Doctor Who in that it set up the continuation of the series for the future through regeneration as well as giving the Doctor another popular reoccurring foe to fight besides the just the Daleks.",1436400000,2,778,4.834586466165414
