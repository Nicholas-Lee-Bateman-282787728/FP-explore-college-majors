8585182,4,B00CQRNMM8,"For 'The Best of Hullabaloo Collection 3', the producers chose the April 20th 1965 episode, trimmed it a bit, and tacked on The Supremes, Woody Allen and Jack Jones from three separate shows. While a whole, unedited episode would be preferable, the result is still entertaining. Highlights include The Animals, Dusty, Jay & The Americans, Lola Falana and The Supremes. Sammy Davis Jr. makes for a great host and all round entertainer. Woody Allen does his typical standup routine, and the Top Pop Medley is a highlight, with Sammy leading The Animals, complete with their Geordie accents, through the old My Fair lady routine: 'the rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain'. The most bizarre, and unintentionally amusing clip, is the ever urbane Jack Jones, onstage on the A Go Go set, rocking his way through 'The Race is On'. Has to be seen to be believed! As a bonus, there's a recent interview with Hullabaloo's producer, Gary Smith.

Of course, the DVD is totally composed of black & white kinescopes, so picture and sound is acceptable only. But for a trip down memory lane, Hullabaloo Collection 3 is worthy of your time and money.",1379721600,5,1137,4.801020408163265
8585183,1,B00CQRNMM8,"Yes, I know, royalties, rights, blah, blah, blah. If a product contains what people want, they will pay the price. Here's a short list of what they could've added (I know a few of these are on these new volumes and the older releases, but the musicians performed multiple songs and some were on multiple episodes, so there's a wealth of unreleased material out there)......

Gerry & The Pacemakers
The Hollies
The Bobby Fuller Four
Smokey Robinson & The Miracles
The Vogues
The Byrds
Paul Revere & The Raiders
Gary Lewis & The Playboys

...and on, and on. The only volume even slightly interesting is Volume 3, because of The Animals and Dusty Springfield. MPI Video has always been one of the worst......",1379203200,10,1051,4.801104972375691
8585184,4,B00CQRNMM8,"For fans of the 1965-1966 Hullabaloo show, MPI is bringing more great performances to dvd in a Best Of Hullabaloo series consisting of 4 separate dvd's available September 10th, 2013. In 2000 to 2002, MPI produced Hullabaloo Vols. 1-4, Hullabaloo Vols. 5-8 and Hullabaloo Vols. 9-12. In these older Volume sets, MPI included some of the Hullabaloo shows on dvd, all in their entirety. The film quality was not the greatest, but seeing the entire shows were fabulous! These Volume Sets from 2000-2002 are now priced out of most people's price range, so being able to purchase these new Best Of Hullabaloo 4 different sets may be a nice alternative.

I truly wish MPI would have made more of the Volume Sets, which include the Hullabaloo Shows in their entirety, instead of these 4 Best Of sets, but I'm happy with any of the old Hullabaloo performances, so I'll take what I can get. I heard the film quality is just like the older Volume Sets- not the greatest, but MPI is including 16-17 performances on each dvd and some fabulous bonus material. MPI always includes great bonus material when they can get it for their dvd's, and they did get some great interviews for these 4 Best Of dvd's. I did try and compare the performances on these Hullabaloo Best Of dvd's with my 2000-2002 Hullabaloo Volume dvd's, and I can only say I found maybe a couple duplicate performances. So, even if you own the Hullabaloo Vols. 1-4, Hullabaloo Vols. 5-8 and Hullabaloo Vols. 9-12, you will enjoy these Best Of performances, of which most are not included in the Volume Sets.

I will list the performances MPI is including in this Best Of Hullabaloo: 3, along with the Bonus Interview, so you can decide if you want it or if you want to compare it to the Volume Sets- if you own them. For the money, this is a great buy, but it is not what I wished for, which would have been a continuation of the Hullabaloo Volumes of the complete shows- only digitally remastered! I love seeing these old Hullabaloo performances again, but seeing the entire old shows with remastered film would have rated 5 Stars, instead of the 4 Stars I'm giving this dvd. The performances alone, the fabulous interview material and great price still rate 4 stars with me, as I know I'll still enjoy going back to 1965-1966 viewing these great stars again in their prime. Here is what you will find on this Best Of Hullabaloo: 3:

01.) Sammy Davis Jr.- A Wonderful Day
02.) The Animals- Bring It On Home To Me
03.) Lola Falana- Some Of These Days
04.) Jay & The Americans- Think Of The Good Times
05.) Dusty Springfield- My Coloring Book
06.) Top Pop Medley: Sammy Davis Jr.- Chim-Chim-Cheree
07.) Sammy Davis Jr. & The Animals- My Fair Lady
08.) Lola Falana- Goldfinger
09.) Bruce Scott- You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'
10.) Dusty Springfield- Can't You Hear My Heartbeat
11.) Cast- Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
12.) The Animals- I'm Crying
13.) Allan Sherman- Crazy Downtown
14.) The Supremes- Where Did Our Love Go, When The Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes, Baby Love
15.) Woody Allen- Comedy Routine
16.) Jack Jones- The Race Is On
BONUS: Interview With Hullabaloo Producer Gary Smith",1376438400,13,3162,4.714285714285714
