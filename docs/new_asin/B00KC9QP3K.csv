Lots of good Curtiss F8C-4 (the same Airplane that took down the original King Kong!) footage, old films of USS Saratoga, and even the Old USS Los Angeles Airship.  Clark Gable was impossibly young in his appearance.  This is the B/W version.  Pleasing to view, from a less complex era.  Your sweetheart won't like it, unless She's an Aviator!!",1402444800,5,372,4.75
8657572,4,B00KC9QP3K,"Good movie but as usual Wallace Berry can get on your nerves at times. But if your a old movie buff, this is a keeper.",1498694400,,118,3.76
8657573,4,B00KC9QP3K,"Terrific visuals.  The US Navy clearly saw a way to publicize their new air capabilities via their newest aircraft carrier, the Saratoga, by allowing Hollywood access to the carrier, actual takeoffs and landings, etc.  Gable's early or earliest film and old comic standby Wallace Beery's far from first film play off each other to perfection.  Plenty of action and love interests.  An Oldie But Goody.",1496793600,,401,5.123076923076923

8657576,4,B00KC9QP3K,"Great movie, but not burned on M-DISC.  Instead, the movie was burned on old-fashioned, obsolete, lasts only about 5 years, DVD-R.

I fully appreciate the fact that these older movies don't justify the volumes to press a disc. But I would've been happy to pay the $2 more to have the disc burned on M-DISC to get it's 1000 year lifetime.

The movie itself had good quality and sound.  Interesting to see Clark Gable in one of his earliest roles.",1457827200,,445,4.525

8657578,3,B00KC9QP3K,"The movie is so typical of the early Thirties, but such an interesting artifact because of that.  I got the movie for its glimpses of life over 80 years ago, and for that it is priceless!  Forget the plot, and even the actors - just watch the backdrop.",1431648000,,252,4.229166666666667
8657579,5,B00KC9QP3K,It is and always will be a favorite of ours. I have looked for over a year to buy it as the old one was wore out. Thanks for getting it for me. 5 stars,1416787200,,151,3.342857142857143

8657581,5,B00KC9QP3K,"love this film, had on vhs taped off tv on tcm and enjoyed it very much.when I saw it was on dvd had to get it.naturally Wallace beery steals the film,it was said beery treated gable badly because he was a newcomer and their rivalry shows on the film.gable looks good without a moustache,this was his 12th film in the year of 1931.good acting from supporting players Dorothy Jordon,cliff Edwards as beerys pal and Marjorie rambeau as beerys sweetheart.",1405468800,4,452,4.734177215189874
