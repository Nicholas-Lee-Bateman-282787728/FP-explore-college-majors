2682784,2,B000K4X5US,"I debated getting this for weeks. I love animals and I figured this collection would certainly fill that desire for some documentaries on them. Well, I regret getting the collection after all. First and foremost, as I knew, these are old documentaries and so the footage quality is fairly poor. But I was expecting this. I would never deduct points for that.

The problem today with watching older documentaries is that a lot of the information presented is now known to be completely false. Example: They said that the komodo dragon is the closest known relative of the dinosaurs. Nope. Try birds and crocodiles. I know this information wasn't known back then but today it is and anyone who gets these documentaries to learn will be mislead.

Another problem I have is the packaging. The 7 DVDs come in 4 slim cases which come in a paper holder. I had an incredibly difficult time getting the DVD cases out of this holder. Also, the discs themselves do not stay in the case well. In each of the four cases that I opened, all of the discs were dislodged.

I was severely disappointed with this collection. But if you were a fan of the Wild Kingdom episodes that played decades ago, I suppose this is the collection to get. But as a 20-year old who likes to stay on the edge of breaking news in the zoology world, I cannot recommend this collection.

I would urge you to check out The Life of Mammals, Blue Planet, The Life of Birds, Life in the Undergrowth, and Planet Earth if you want to see good informational nature documentaries.",1174694400,19,1534,4.567272727272727

2682796,5,B000K4X5US,"I really enjoyed watching these dvd's. First time I have seen Marlin Perkins & Jim Fowler in Wild Kingdom since the 60's. I remember growing up watching them. At one time I had an autograph picture of Marlin, wild kingdom book, 2 comic books,& a world wall map showing where they had captured animals. Don't know where that stuff is now, but at least I have these dvd's. I did an internet search and cant find any of this stuff for sale",1296000000,3,436,4.329268292682927
2682797,5,B000K4X5US,"Mabye some of the info. in this series may be outdated but,i watched this as a kid. I orginally checked this out through my local library and i really enjoyed seing how they capture and study these animals. I'm a big fan old, retro type tv shows an movies to begin with and always thier will be an interest in the wild kingdom,the picture and sound quailty to me was great...some of these epidoes are 40 years old. The only thing i didn't like was the packaging...it looks fine but the center section was a pain to take off and on. Otherwise no complaints with me..:)",1267056000,,567,4.3584905660377355
2682798,4,B000K4X5US,"After I purchased the collection of MUTUAL OF OMAHA'S WILD KINGDOM, I cannot beleive it myself as well after all these years I am able to view the series again; even if it is by watching the dvd collection. This will no doubt, become of my favorites in my entire dvd collection; also I am watching one of the shows as I write the review that is entitled, WOMEN OF THE AFRICAN WILD.",1258243200,,381,4.232876712328767
2682799,3,B000K4X5US,"We ordered this Wild Kingdom DVD set from atthemoviesco, and it was supposed to be in brand new condition and factory sealed.  When we received it, it was unwrapped and the discs were scratched.  We let Amazon customer service know (since Amazon supposedly fulfilled the order), and they simply said we could return it and try buying it again.  Exchanging the used DVD set for what we actually ordered was not an option.  Very disappointing.",1250726400,2,441,4.84
2682800,4,B000K4X5US,"This show is as fun and captivating today as it was when it originally aired.
I got this as a Christmas present for my father - i remember watching it with him when I was little - now I'm watching it with my children - and they love it as much as I always have - the 50 episodes have a great variety of all the show had to offer.",1231632000,3,329,3.7142857142857144

2682802,4,B000K4X5US,"This is definitely geared for purchasers who grew up with Wild Kingdom. My husband and I are 37yrs old and have fond memories of the show. We bought it for our 4.5yr old WHO IS ADDICTED to it. We have to restrict his viewing time.

I think it was definitely worth the $$. It is interesting to watch and covers a broad range of animals. the quality is not the greatest but my son hasn't noticed. As one viewer mentioned this is footage from the 60-70's.
I would far rather watch this with my son that cartoons.",1211932800,10,509,4.247422680412371
2682803,1,B000K4X5US,"This product on the cover looks up-to-date and pretty modern but when watching it, it looks like it might as well have been in black and white, it was filmed so long ago.  It greatly lacked entertainment value and I wish I had saved my money and just watched Animal Planet or Crocodile Hunter or something like that for free.",1202428800,4,325,4.416666666666667
2682804,4,B000K4X5US,"I literally grew up with Mutual Of Omaha's WILD KINGDOM!  I have fond memories of the show.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, sometimes the footage is far from perfect...one has to remember that some of these shows are well over 40 years old!  Plus, I seem to remember them as always being a bit rough.  Marlin Perkins was a kind, grandfatherly figure as host.  I think people often forget that he was a bona-fide Zoologist (PhD).

As to some of the information from the shows being dated, that is true.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, one has to view them in context.

The folks in their 30s,40s, and 50s are probably the best target audience for the shows, although they should appeal to a broader audience.  There is a large nostalgia factor here.

As to the presentation, well....this IS a BCI release, after all.  They are not always bastions of great quality DVD releases.  Actually, they didn't do a bad job.  I picked this one up at a discout club for $23.  Not bad for 7 double sided discs and 50-30 minute episodes.
(I also complain that the box is rather a poor touch and there is very little documentation included....not even production dates).",1191801600,25,1161,4.627450980392157

8154382,5,B000K4X5US,I am very pleased with it. I found it excellent although it is an old series (Aired 1963 to 1971) so the film quality is not like today.,1462752000,,136,3.892857142857143
8154383,2,B000K4X5US,Watched one episide and donated them. Should have reviewed the publication date to realize how outdated the cameras /technology was in the 1970's. Guess we are spoiled with the National Geographic animal productions.,1445299200,,216,5.575757575757576

8154385,5,B000K4X5US,"I used to watch these when I was a kid, so it was a nice flashback to watch these! Once I started watching them I didn't want to stop. I had a Mutual of Omaha marathon, and I learned so much about the animal kingdom! Very informative and entertaining. Marlin Perkins is great in these - age doesn't keep him from jumping into taxing or dangerous situations! I especially love the trick he used to catch a peregrine falcon!",1388534400,,422,4.3544303797468356

8154387,3,B000K4X5US,The material is dated and comes across a little corny.  There is too much time spent capturing animals instead of filming them in their natural environment.  So most of the material is about the antics of Mr. Perkins and his sidekicks as they capture everything from anteaters to eagles.,1350604800,,287,4.836734693877551
8154388,4,B000K4X5US,"My dad used to talk about Wild Kingdom all the time when I was growing up. I am too young to know the show, but I was thrilled to get this DVD set and watch what he was always talking about. It doesn't waste a lot of time with the mythology of environmentalism and animal rights, it just shows animals the way they live, how they hunt and kill, and teaches a lot about them and promotes a love for the animals. It's a little dated and I found that MY kids didn't watch too much without getting bored (except when the kills happened!) but still, for me it was great to see so many of these shows.",1316908800,3,595,4.0508474576271185

8154390,5,B000K4X5US,"Fantastic program---like no other---totally unique and memorable from my childhood. However, these shows are created one season at a time---why not offer them: 1) by season...then 2) by animal species/family....then 3) by geographic area. This seems to me to be a logical marketing progression for a video series of this type; yes, there's a hint of this---but it occurs haphazardly, not with a high level of intent and organization like it should be for all the seasons. When I get Amazon search results on this the organization of the different DVDs offered makes ZERO sense....it's barely logical at all. Some people like these shows because they bring back childhood (organized by season); others because they like a particular species of animal (organized by animal type)---like cats; still others because they like to know about the wildlife specific to their own or other geographical areas (by geography). Marty Stauffer's 'Wild America' is offered in two large volumes---seasons 1-6 and seasons 7-12---spectacular program with marketing that is SIMPLE and LOGICAL. If these WK videos weren't so spectacular for their educational and time-capsule value this series would be doomed. The people in charge of producing and marketing these DVD's  get to keep their jobs simply because of Marlin Perkins, his co-stars---both animal and human---and the producers of the show.",1296259200,3,1377,5.375
