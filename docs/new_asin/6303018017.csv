532515,4,6303018017,"I echo the other reviews on this site, this was a great rendition of the Jazz Singer, previously seen in the 1920s and later in the Neil Diamond rendition in the '80s.  Peggy Lee really could do it all...she was great as a singer, a songwriter, and as an actress.  ""Lover"" is such a great song.

We have 2/3rds of the JS renditions out there on DVD, now it's time to make this one available as well!",1200441600,6,399,4.1558441558441555

Danny Thomas gives a fine performance and had a voice that I think few people even knew about, let alone recognized him for. Peggy Lee also out does herself in her role as a Broadway artist and recording star. This lady always could lay out a song with emotion and style.

But couldn't he have at least removed that clown nose during the final dramatic key scene while he recited, I believe, the kol nidre (and while wearing a prayer shawl no less)? And as far as the DVD cover, a more appropriate title would've been THE CLOWN SINGER. I usually like Molly Picon but she was totally over the top in this. It was interesting though to see a young Barry Gordon who I remember fondly from A THOUSAND CLOWNS. My recommendation is don't waste your time or money.",1425081600,,567,4.514563106796117

532766,2,6303018017,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I was pleasantly surprised to find the stylistic arrangements of Ms. Peggy Lee crooning several favorite tunes of the day. She has a most melodic voice and is absolutely stunning! I found her performance the most worthwhile aspect of this film.

Danny Thomas appears to try overly hard to make his character believable and moves more towards the theatrical vs emotionally wrought. Thomas's comedy routines fall flat and is overshadowed by Ms. Lee in every scene. I could not wait to see more of her and was disappointed in her mostly secondary role. I think the only scene that let her acting chops shine bright was the phone call to Thomas from the swanky New York apartment party.

High recommend for Lee's rare film performance and sumptuous temple interior shots.",1409788800,,809,4.890510948905109
532767,5,6303018017,I gave it 5 stars because I have been a life long Jerry Lewis fan.  I loved seeing him do something different.,1406937600,,110,4.0

532771,4,6303018017,"Good story, but felt the comedy took a little away from the sadness of the situation. Therefore only four stars.",1389139200,,112,4.65
532772,2,6303018017,"The Jazz Singer (1959) with Jerry Lewis starring was a surprise to me. I'm a long time Martin and Lewis fan but slowly lost interested with much of his solo work. It was produced as a television series, Startime on ABC, and was broadcast on October 13, 1959. I never knew Lewis had performed in this roll since the original one hour episode had never been rebroadcast, only recently being released in 2012.

The Jazz SInger is a fantastic story. I think most folk think of the 1980, Neil Diamond version. The original full length motion picture was released in 1927 as an American Musical Film, starring Al Jolson. The actual screening of the film was a technical nightmare as each of Jolson's songs had their own reel and own sound plate. Crazy times back in the early days of ""Talkies.""

I was hoping to see Jerry Lewis at his best, even though his showing of the Jazz Singer was done as an early TV broadcast. I was very disappointed. Without knowing the story of Joey Rabinowitz, aka as Joey Robbins, the viewer might have difficulty catching on to the plot of a Jewish young adult who left home to make a living cracking jokes and singing jazz, instead of following in his fathers footsteps as a Jewish Cantor. About midway through the production the story plot line collapses together.

Lewis' acting is sketchy at best. Lines are delivered out of time, blocking is poor even if one takes into consideration it was blocked more as a work of theatre more than for TV. Even the comedy sketches were below Lewis' level and simply not funny. I'm not sure who told Lewis he could sing a serious and dramatic song as he seemed to have a difficult time even coming close to hitting the correct notes. That said, he preformed one number accapella. Without having to stay in key with the music, it was Lewis' best number of the hour.

The one strong point of the show came through the performance of Eduard Franz who played Joey's father, the Cantor. His performance as a father struggling to understand his son and failing to understand why his son would simply walk away from five generations of a family heritage, was, in my opinion, spot on and managed to carry the show.

Another standout performance was done by Molly Picon who played Joeys mother. In the role of peacemaker between her stubborn husband and son, Picon's performance gave life to the frustrated Jewish mother.

With all said and done, this show is just short of an hour in length. There are worse things you could with an hour of free time.  That said I would recommend taking a little extra time and watching the  Neil Diamonds version instead of this one.",1386115200,,2626,4.584221748400853
532773,5,6303018017,"This is a beautiful story of forgiveness, love and loyalty. Yes, it was made in a time before CG and special effects but the story outshines all of that. For me...well...I enjoy seeing movies from the past without all the modern technology because it's nostalgic. This one was made before I was born but I remember seeing similar shows, possibly as reruns as a young girl. I hope our younger generations will appreciate it for what it is.",1383868800,,438,4.628205128205129
532836,2,6303018017,"It was like watching a skit that you wonder, is it done yet?  It's very short and sad.  It just didn't have much depth to it and maybe that's because of the type of movies in the 50s.?",1378425600,,184,3.8157894736842106
532837,5,6303018017,"Jerry Lewis is a man known for his comedy and his slap stick movies. That is not the Jerry you will see here. Jerry Lewis shows his dramatic talents in this short, but awesome film. His drama talents are, in my opinion, far superior to his comeday and that is saying alot. I love Jerry Lewis films. They make me laugh and help me forget all my troubles for just a few moments. This film  did that an more. Though the laugh wasn't there, the Jazz Singer held me spell bound from start to finish. This man is truly an American Icon, a true all around performer. This is a must see for any Jerry Lewis fan or any one who loves drama.",1378425600,,630,4.121951219512195
532838,3,6303018017,It's been years since I've seen this movie and I was particularly saddened from the beginning of the film.  I'm not sure I'll make it to the end of the film.  Memories dull until awakened by stark reality.,1372204800,,205,4.368421052631579
532839,4,6303018017,"I recommend this DVD if for nothing else Peggy Lee's performance. Danny Thomas' singing pales drastically, but he has a warm and charming personality. I think there is too much focus in the script on his choice between what his father wants (to take on his clergy leadership) and his choice to be an entertainer and succeed on his own. This is a rare performance and I'm glad it is now available. They could have had special features that would sell this package. Too bad there was not more of Peggy Lee performances. Were there any outtakes or deleted scenes? They could have enhanced the sound and given other sound choices. I had never scene the original movie, don't know if it was shortened.",1366243200,,696,4.620967741935484

532842,5,6303018017,"A movie every musician with dreams of playing professionally will love!! It shows what a kid with tremendous talent and a Single Minded Will to Preform and Succeed Can Do. The term - Never Give Up is only a start to what it takes for a person to make it in the Music Business, but with Allot of Hard Work and ALLOT of Determination and a Never Give Up Attitude it Can Be Done. Danny Thomas shows all that and more in this story. He is a Jewish boy who trains for and is supposed to perpetuate another generation of singers for his family in his synagog. He dreams of singing jazz and singing on Broadway though. To do so he has to fight his father who devoted his life to singing in the synagog just as his father did and the father before him. As I remember it the family had sung in their synagog for five generations. This tear jerker will enthrall and delight you!! A Must See!!!!!!! Also look for the more modern The Jazz Singer staring Neil Diamond. Its not the same exact story, and that adds to it being so enjoyable. It is every bit as enjoyable and has just as many Great Songs. The Last time I saw it I sang the songs in my head for several days afterward ha ha. Its Also A Must See!!!!!!!",1361404800,,1200,4.15450643776824
532843,4,6303018017,"I bought this to fill out my collection of versions of ""The Jazz Singer"". The four films starred Al Jolson (1927), Danny Thomas (1953), Jerry Lewis (1959) and Neil Diamond (1980). Each version was essentially an exhibition of the starring performer's individual style. The story of each was about a Jewish singer who wanted to break out of the traditional role of cantor to get into popular show business.

Mr. Thomas was a very popular entertainer in his time.  This movie shows off his various talents. I enjoyed this version, but then, I am a fan of older films, especially musicals.

As a review of the DVD, well, it's a DVD and plays well in my DVD player, so I suppose it's wonderful.",1352246400,,690,4.59349593495935
532844,4,6303018017,"I bought this for a research project for a film theory class, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was comparing the three versions of The Jazz Singer, and the music and comic elements of this one really shine, and help cut through the melodramatic story line.  Anyone who enjoys older films or easy, swinging jazz songs, should really enjoy this one.

I was also impressed by the DVD quality, since it's a DVD-R ""burn on order"" product.  As the product warning says, I wasn't able to play it in my standard DVD player, as it is also a recorder, but it played with no issues on my laptop.",1336953600,5,581,4.401869158878505
