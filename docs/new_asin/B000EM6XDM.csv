8111085,3,B000EM6XDM,"A workmanlike presentation of some of the very basic facts of the Siege.  To my disappointment, no re-enactors were used.

I've yet to across a source that answers these questions that follow, so I don't want to imply my asking them suggests unique faults with this movie.

To what extent could the Fort of Vicksburg inhibit Union supply river traffic upstream and downstream (i.e., completely?  30%  70?)?

Realizing rivers were relatively efficient ways to transport supplies (vis--vis wagons and mules albeit I am not as certain as to the relative merits between the use of rivers and railroads), how critical was it to have ""unrestricted"" access to the ENTIRE river?  (Recall, New Orleans was in Union hands.)

What would the effects have been - and the responses to - random/sporadic/varying placements of Rebel cannon along the long shoreline of the otherwise ""unrestricted"" river?

By only holding a non-besieged Vicksburg, did that allow the Rebels to effectively transfer supplies and troops across the Misssissippi from West to East?

Beginning in  the summer of 1863, how much material and how many troops were effectively contained in the Western Confederacy and prohibited from moving East? Assuming any, how much of a difference might they have made and how?  Louis J Sheehan",1198022400,,1289,5.144230769230769
8111086,4,B000EM6XDM,"I've always wondered about this campaign. Ken Burns' Documentary only covered a small portion of it. This makes up for that however. Vicksburg was the ""Key of the confederacy"" as Lincoln put it.

There's a lot to learn from this documentary, the only drawback is sometimes the narrator gets muted out with the sounds of Cannon and gunfire in the background.",1149811200,2,357,4.852459016393443
