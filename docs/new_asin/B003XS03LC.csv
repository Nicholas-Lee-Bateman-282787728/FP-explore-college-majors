8408500,1,B003XS03LC,"Four girls head out to the home of Jordan (Toni M. Williams) whose father is an archaeologist, for a get away vacation. This includes the token blond Beth (Jessica Mathews) who leaves the window open on her street parked Mustang while she is gone. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, other than the fact it was just poorly made. While there, Lily (Skye Noel) becomes obsessed and possessed by Lilith as this is the first stage of the book of Revelation...sort of. One by one...

The film was fairly bad from plot, dialouge, filming, details, and acting. Low budget and it shows. Not worth 90 minutes of your life. Also known as ""The Night Owl.""
