4699068,5,B005H3GY6E,"Join Julieanna Hever as she takes viewers on a journey across the nation to meet some of the leading authorities advocating a plant-strong, meat-free, dairy-free and oil-free diet.

This video introduces the benefits of changing one's diet...and also presents information about the dietary choices that contribute to many of the diseases that plague so many in Western civilization, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and more.

Julieanna is engaging and friendly throughout the video. In fact, although it is obvious that she is passionate about her choice to adopt a vegan lifestyle, at no point does she make the viewer uncomfortable. The viewer is allowed to ""check out"" the information and make his or her own decision. And that is as it should be.

I highly recommend this video, and also recommend ""Forks Over Knives"" for those seeking additional information on the topic of choosing the proper foods to reverse disease and improve health!",1315267200,18,961,5.2272727272727275
8472629,1,B005H3GY6E,"I have to agree with Shopper Rose.  To Your Health was VERY thin on content and somewhat chaotic in format.  I think the potential was there.  Many wonderful interviewees were included but the presentation was very flimsy and it seemed to be more of a visual showcase for Julieanne Hever, who was laughing in just about every clip.  She is very fit and beautiful but not very informative.  Forks Over Knives was a much better film about the health benefits of a vegan diet.",1344384000,2,473,4.583333333333333
8472630,1,B005H3GY6E,"We have watched several very informative, intellegent movies pertaining to the healthy lifestyle. This is not one of them. Although this woman interviewed many  brilliant people, the information was predictable, shallow and uninspiring. Watch ""Food Matters,"" ""Forks Over Knives"" or ""Eating"" if you want to be encouraged to eat healthfully.",1333065600,12,339,5.78
8472631,4,B005H3GY6E,"Good video.  Full of very good information on why everyone should turn away from the ""normal"" western American diet and eat plant based, whole foods for the best nutrition.",1327795200,2,172,4.931034482758621
8472632,5,B005H3GY6E,"Well done flick! We've seen most of the current documentaries on this topic, but this one presented some new explanations and ideas, all in an upbeat and modern way. Highly recommended! Buy for all the ones you love!",1325980800,3,216,4.7105263157894735
8472633,5,B005H3GY6E,"After meeting the author at the annual Health Expo in Woodland Hills, Ca I bought this DVD and her ""Plant based Nutrition for Dummies"" book.  This DVD is cheerful and full of good information.  I've been Vegan/vegetarian for decades so I knew most of the information in it but I use it to introduce the subject to people new to the subject/lifestyle.",1324252800,7,350,4.629032258064516
8472634,5,B005H3GY6E,"This is a Great little documentary that introduces you to the health benefits of eating as close to nature as possible. Her name is Julieanna Hever and she is how healthy looks, sounds and acts! She obviously walks the talk and inspires you to follow. You become captivated by the film through the message in her vibrant smile and enthusiasm. She has many informative, short online videos that compliment this film. The experts she interviews are just that, experts!
 They each also have books and documentaries which delve much further into this lifestyle choice.
Food is mood, and the mood after listening to the message of this film will be one of excited optimism. Those who say; change a light bulb and save the planet are the same people selling the light bulbs! This go green message (literally) is however very real and will not only save the planet and your life, but more importantly will transform your quality of life.
 Healthy not only feels different but tastes different to. Some healthy tastes, take some getting used to but are worth the effort. I just think of Julieanna's vibrant smile, and it tastes Grrrrrrrrrrrrreat !!!!",1323820800,4,1142,4.851282051282051
8472635,4,B005H3GY6E,"Julieanna Hever presents in a fun and energetic way the benefits of eating a whole foods, plant based diet. Interviewing many of todays leading advocates in the field or nutrition, medical and scientific practice.

If there's anything new that I got from this video was when Julieanna quoted (which always seems to stump the naysayers) ""A Vegan driving a Hummer is more energy efficient than a meat eater to driving a Prius! It says it all right there"" :-)",1323648000,4,456,4.772151898734177
8472636,4,B005H3GY6E,"I liked this movie a lot. It is a good intro movie. I have been veg for years and am always looking for new research. Most of us have seen this info. Julieanna is a doll with a love, smile, laugh, and a great goal. Most of the heavy hitters are here. I would have liked to see John Robbins but again it may be because of all the other info I have watched or read. It again is great seeing the people I have respected for their views but in a short answer format, quick and to the point. Lots of people have found videos like meet your meat important to get into a plant based non animal harming life style. A video like this is the next step to help people get their foundation solid. Save the animals yes, also care for yourself.",1322179200,3,730,4.041379310344827
8472637,5,B005H3GY6E,"As a complete neophyte to the plant based world, I found ""To Your Health"" to be an eye opening experience. Far from being a preachy, soap box standing collection of rhetoric, the facts are presented in a collection of light hearted, and entertaining interviews with most of the leading lights in the movement. For me, this made the information easy to digest (pun intended) without feeling I was being beaten over the head with statistics. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested in learning about plant based nutrition, and for the wisdom and insight provided by the experts featured.",1320710400,6,601,4.96039603960396
8472638,5,B005H3GY6E,"To truly live a vibrant and authentic life one must honor the sanctity of optimum wellness. The value you place on your health is a reflection of your food choices.

Scientists have stretched hypotheses and technology to ridiculous lengths to dissect individual nutrients in their quests to discover and define optimal health. This exhaustive approach is a losing proposition.

This delightful film dispels the myths and glaring misinformation we have been conditioned to believe as truths for the sake of profits. The value of food ought not be judged by its advertising budget, its novelty or any other despicable mode in the interest of capitalism.

Hever and Pomeroy cleverly piece together the fragmented puzzle of nutrition that has permeated nearly every aspect of our society. The energetic tandem criss-crossed the country to interview an all-star ensemble of plant-based, whole foods authorities and experts to discern the truth.

The truth is we have been duped by the highly politicized food policies and agendas. The secret to optimum wellness is the daily consumption of plant-based whole foods. Our attempts to analyze and alter the laws of nature have compromised our awareness - and it shows. The alarming levels of obesity and the proliferation of chronic and degenerative diseases are directly linked to the Standard American Diet and our penchant for convenience.

Hever, Pomeroy and the esteemed participants in this film convey in an entertaining and comprehensible fashion the mountains of daunting information and data inherent to the field of nutrition. It is likely that you will learn volumes more from this short documentary than you did in school.

This film redefines the symbiotic relationship between health and nutrition. The science is overwhelmingly clear. The innumerable benefits from consuming foods to which we are biologically adapted to eat is unequivocal.

This jewel will inspire you to assess how much you truly value your health and implement the appropriate action - your life depends on it.",1319760000,13,2037,5.307453416149069
