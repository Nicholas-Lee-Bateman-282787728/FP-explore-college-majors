While Fischer-Dieskau is not in his prime here, he has always been a great singer and the performance is fine.  I have not been able to find a way to get any subtitles for the songs, however, and, while texts are printed in the booklet that comes with the DVD, they are only in German.  I haven't had a chance to view the bonus DVD of ""Balladen"" which includes Schumann's ""Ballade von Haideknaben"" Op. 122 no. 1, Liszt's ""Leonore"" and ""Der traurige Mnch"", and Viktor Ullmann's ""Die Weise von Liebe und Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke"", which was apparently composed at the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1944 and are spoken readings of poems by Rilke with piano accompaniment.
