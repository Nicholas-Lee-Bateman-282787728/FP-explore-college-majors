1783714,5,B00006L92I,"This DVD contains a 35 min making of the motion picture ""Gods and Generals"" on disc # 2",1037145600,8,87,3.888888888888889
1783745,3,B00006L92I,"The positive:

- Lots of detailed information.
- Some good presenters, such as James McPherson.
- Seems quite historically accurate.

The negative:

- Background period band music is often distracting.
- Rapid pace of narrative can be hard to follow details.
- Richard Dreyfuss main narrator is that good, IMO.
- Seems kind of haphazardly produced / organized.

The visual is often various soldiers traipsing about in what appears to be civil war re-enactments. This is usually kind of interesting but at times seems a little silly.",1374710400,4,532,5.080459770114943
1783746,3,B00006L92I,"If one associates ""great"" with excessive, then truly 1864 had many of the ""great"" battles of the Civil War, for more soldiers died in that year, than any other year of the war and it is why some call Grant a butcher.  If we define ""great"" in some other way such as being influential on the war's outcome, then this dvd is truly misnamed.  However, in either case, this is not a comprehensive overview of the war.

The Shaara family wrote three well known Civil War books, the father wrote ""The Killer Angels"" which Ted Turner made into the movie ""Gettysburg"".  The son wrote ""Gods and Generals"" (the prequel) which Ted Turner turned into the movie of the same name.  And the son also wrote ""Last Full Measure"" (the sequel) which to date has not been made into a movie, except here.  This is the substitute.  Full of Jeff Shaara and the war in 1864, it is full of detail, sometimes too much.  Good battle scenes with re-enactors, plenty of old photos and interviews with Shaara and Ed Bearss.  Interesting stuff covers both the war in Virginia and in Georgia.

1783747,5,B00006L92I,"This is a series which focuses on the military aspects of the war. Other reviews state that they found problems with the series in regards to its passive approach to addressing the slavery issue and states rights. In some ways there could be improvements, but in no way does one thing cause so much alarm as to negate the nine more hours of film and information. The Smithsonian does not, repeat, does not misrepresent anything. It reflects perspectives (usually through actual quotes) held by people on both sides of the war, which by itself should start conflict because those perspectives actually did. There is no better overview for the new student of the war to get a framework from which to start building their own opinions and perspectives. The information is dead on and the maps are great. The series is easy to follow and has great ""re-watch-ability.""",1362096000,8,863,4.837837837837838
1783748,5,B00006L92I,"I have the set on VHS and looking forward to getting the DVD's. Finally a truthful set without a bunch of false political correctness which twists American History. I've studied the Civil War for 41 years and I'm now about 50. I'm also a Civil War living historian. To answer the previous person, I have a good friend who is around 64 and lived his whole life in the Greenville/Spartanburg area of South Carolina. He also says that the war was about slavery and thinks a lot of President Lincoln. Well...enough of the political stuff. I would recommend this set to ANYBODY who loves history and specifically the Civil War. They will definitely hear the truth!",1329004800,5,659,4.689655172413793

1783752,1,B00006L92I,"The creator of this dvd set seems to have little reguard for the truth. It is an example of taking history and retelling it from one point of view. One would think every southern familay had slaves and beat them daily. Truth is about 10% of the population owned 95% of the slaves. When one spends a lifetime studying this time period as I have (73)one realizes what a shallow work this. At best inaccurate, at worst deliberate misleading.",1194652800,18,438,4.556962025316456
1783753,1,B00006L92I,"This series of programmes seem to have been pulled together without a great deal of research or professionalism.

1783754,1,B00006L92I,This DVD was a big disappointment. I thought that Smithsonian would provide  an objective presentation of the entire era of the War Between the States. Not so.

It relies, of course, on many history ""re-enactors"", which is all to the good, making possible more interesting narrative than in any other documentary.",1480636800,,370,4.951612903225806

The Smithsonian's Great Battles of the Civil War DVD set is comprised of 3 Disks, each lasting 3 hours for a total of 9 hours. It is primarily focused on the military aspects of the war.

During the Civil War, over 10,000 battles took place. Of these, 384 battles have been singled out by historians as having particular significance. These 384 battles have been further subdivided into classes according to their relative importance:

Class A - Decisive (45 battles): A general engagement involving field armies in which a commander achieved a vital strategic objective. Such a result might include an indisputable victory on the field or be limited to the success or termination of a campaign offensive. Decisive battles had a direct, observable impact on the direction, duration, conduct, or outcome of the war.

Class B - Major (104 battles): An engagement of magnitude involving field armies or divisions of the armies in which a commander achieved an important strategic objective within the context of an ongoing campaign offensive. Major battles had a direct, observable impact on the direction, duration, conduct, or outcome of the campaign.

Class C - Formative (127 battles): An engagement involving divisions or detachments of the field armies in which a commander accomplished a limited campaign objective of reconnaissance, disruption, defense, or occupation. Formative battles had an observable influence on the direction, duration, or conduct of the campaign.

Class D - Limited (107 battles): An engagement, typically involving detachments of the field armies, in which a commander achieved a limited tactical objective of reconnaissance, defense, or occupation. Limited battles maintained contact between the combatants without observable influence on the direction of the campaign.

The Smithsonian does an excellent job of covering the most important battles of the Civil War:

Class A - 45 of 45 (100%) are covered
Class B - 71 of 104 (68%) are covered
Class C - 32 of 127 (25%) are covered
Class D - 4 of 107 (4%) are covered

Richard Dreyfuss is the principal narrator. Other well-known actors provide additional quotes and commentary.

Campaigns are discussed in detail, with animated maps, period photographs, paintings and drawings, along with modern recreations of these battles staged by re-enactors. Actual uniforms, weapons and artifacts from the Smithsonian's vast collection are demonstrated and explained.

If you are primarily interested in the military aspects of the Civil War, this is the most comprehensive DVD set you will find. (and YES, I have watched the Ken Burns set - several times).",1375142400,7,2678,5.307328605200945
