appoint. They are right on here w/
this timely lighthouses history.

These tapes cover all lighthouses in
the different regions of the USA. A
great history which I highly recom-
mend. Way to go PBS!",1292025600,,235,4.7317073170731705
2525465,5,B000EOTEE0,"I recently purchased the Madacy tin box set ""Lighthouses of America"" and I while I was delighted by the audio/visual presentation I found it somewhat lacking in actual information.  I instantly fell in love with this set by PBS, which is more geared towards presenting facts and still offers a high quality audio/visual presentation.  I cannot recommend this set highly enough.  If you are passionate about lighthouses or just have a passing interest then I can guarantee you will be satisfied with this set from PBS.",1252972800,10,517,4.988372093023256
