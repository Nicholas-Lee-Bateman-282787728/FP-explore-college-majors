8273105,2,B0019A35G6,"While the movie offers an interesting alternative perspective on the effects of environmental campaigns, it completely ignores the benefits of them. They intentionally focus on only environmentalists whose words can be twisted against them.

It's also just incredibly boring. Believe it or not, documentaries can be engaging and interesting, but this one certainly isn't. It's also poorly made. The sequences where they borrow footage are sloppy, jarring, and ineffective. A narrator's voice often override's the voice of people who are being interviewed and it's an ugly juxtaposition.

Really, just don't bother with this documentary.",1490140800,,636,5.75531914893617
8273106,5,B0019A35G6,A must-see! This eye-opening documentary is vital to understanding the other side of the environmental story. The powerful environmental lobby is so much more than the altruism and compassion we hear about ad nauseam.,1427328000,,217,5.411764705882353

8273108,3,B0019A35G6,"For those who just enjoy learning more about other cultures and how they deal with certain issues this film is worth at least a one time view.  It wasn't ""mind-blowing"" or ""powerful"" but we took some notes throughout the film and found it educational.",1400976000,,251,4.704545454545454
8273109,5,B0019A35G6,"Shows how do-gooders have ruined so many people's lives by their selfish agenda to save the planet. They lie and stretch the truth and they get big money for their work.

They use the rationale  for not letting industry or mining enter a poverty area because the kids smile so much. Happiness index...tragic because they smile all the way to an early grave living in total poverty while the people that stop the project live on their very expensive yachts.

It is a must see! . I must admit too, I used to buy into this environmental stuff and donated money year after year to help save the environment. I Was Blind &Stupid for not really studying  carefully the real issue myself.  Earth Day is another con as well ...Thank you Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Maurice Strong!

We do no have an global warming problem, we have a UN led political agenda of making the rich richer and the middle and lower class poorer by destroying the middle class. Less than one percent of the worlds population make $20.000 or more so if you are squiring by on $20.000  you are making to much. The UN openly admits that the main problem with the earth is over population. So with that in mind why are they insisting on all these inoculations ...is there something wrong with this scenario.

The sun goes through cycles and therefore CO2 has nothing to do with the temperature or climate of the earth. We are in a cooling cycle now, not warming. Alvin Gore is not evil just wrong! Well he is a rich hypocrite, with his homes planes and other big carbon footprint items. LOL

I expect to get some very negative comments about my review because most of the Universities teach bad stuff, Why? Because they are funded by the government and it's agenda is to dumb down the populace. Ie Rachel Carson said this therefore it has to be correct. Obama gets a peace prize and gets us into more conflicts. Gore gets a prize and causes more environmental damage etc etc etc.",1367280000,5,1936,4.492877492877493

Many well-meaning people give donations to environmental organizations such as Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth, not realizing that their money is being used to oppress the world's poorest people rather than to save the earth or animals.  Phelim McAleer has done a great service by producing a documentary that shows just how the oppression works.

Through interviews with some of the world's poorest, with professors of universities who have studied the environmental movement, and with environmentalists, we are shown how environmentalists deny the poor an opportunity to better themselves, in some cases denying them the last vestige of hope in improving their lives.  At times the presentation is very poignant.

We in the west are severely hampered economically by environmental regulation after regulation, but what tugs at the viewer's heart is that the most vulnerable have just about no defense against the oppressors.

As the movie shows the pattern is the same.  A rich environmentalist living in a city far from the village opposes the opening of a mine in that village.  The environmentalist pretends to know what the villagers really want without asking the villagers.  It boils down to the rich man imposing his/her values on the poor and denying them the opportunity for work and for prosperity that they dearly would like to have, the same sort of prosperity that the rest of us enjoy.

As a professor at the University of Kent, England, points out, the environmentalist has even more power as his voice is the only one heard by global environmental institutions that yield a lot of power.  One environmentalist won an award of $125,000 for opposing a mine in Romania, as we see in the film, but that person did so by misrepresenting the reality of life in that Romanian village.

I write this review hoping that others will watch this very informative but, at times, rather sad film.  It needs to be watched.  The fat-cat environmentalists need to be stopped.",1329004800,15,2223,5.5
8273111,4,B0019A35G6,Fantastic film!  Provides a real-world approach to environmentalism and development.  A much needed rebuttal to common media hype and colonialist attitudes around mining projects and development.,1280966400,17,195,6.461538461538462
