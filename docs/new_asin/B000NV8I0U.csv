2783457,5,B000NV8I0U,I just took a Wendy Froud 3-day class in Petaluma CA in July 2010. We made furry fantasy creatures and I am now hooked on polymer sculpting. Ordered the DVD and just finished my faery. The basics for making any form of polymer doll are thoroughly explained and demonstrated in this 2-disc DVD. Wendy is fantastic!,1282262400,7,313,4.607142857142857
2783458,5,B000NV8I0U,This DVD was so helpful to me...I have been making fantasy figures in polymer clay for the past eight years and have been inspired by both Brian and Wendy Frouds work in Faery.........I have developed good basic skills in making Art Dolls over the years but Wendy Frouds video helped me to really be able to fine tune my skills...........her lessons were clear and concise and easy to follow........I feel that this DVD has been an invaluable tool in enabling me to raise my dolls to a more professional level......,1219276800,11,515,4.733333333333333
2783459,5,B000NV8I0U,I took a sculpting workshop with Wendy and she was just great!  Her son Toby was also very helpful.  The DVD is really great to have as a record of what she taught in her workshop.  I didn't have to take any notes because it's all right there in the DVD.  I'm so glad that I purchased it.  It makes for a great refresher course and I also recommend it for anyone not fortunate enough to be able to take the workshops!,1203379200,7,417,4.036585365853658

8181468,5,B000NV8I0U,"Wendy is an intuitive artist which I love. She starts with a guided meditation to relax and focus your creative mind and her voice is calming. One of the best sculpting videos I've ever seen, but if you want exact directions on how to sculpt every inch of the fairy, this is not what you're looking for.",1411171200,,303,4.333333333333333
8181469,5,B000NV8I0U,"From a beginner's point of view, it is everything that I expected and more. Wendy's step by step on every subject is simple and fun.",1401753600,,132,4.32
8181470,5,B000NV8I0U,This is one of the best tutorial DVDs that I have seen for sculpting figures. Very clear and easy to understand the process. I recommend it anyone wanting to create a fantasy figure.,1386288000,,182,4.545454545454546
8181471,5,B000NV8I0U,"Been waiting for years to get this video. It's a great addition to standard instructional texts, and a good refresher from her live course.",1362614400,,139,4.833333333333333
8181472,5,B000NV8I0U,"This DVD is a Must have for anyone learning to sculpt. I have been learning to sculpt for a while now, reading and watching a ton of stuff with some frustration. For someone with not alot of natural talent but an enourmous amount of determination( Me), Wendy Froud is the way to go.  I found myself thinking "" that's so simple, why haven't I heard that before?"". She is remarkably descriptive, easy to watch, and  explains everything she is doing, never leaving the watcher wondering how. She anticipates her students mistakes and questions and addresses them in such a way that you feel as if you can fix whatever mistakes you make while learning. Lots of sculpting direction, hair,eyes, body, costuming, posing- nothing is left out. If it seems a little pricey- well you get what you pay for and it's worth every penny.",1330992000,8,821,4.694444444444445
8181473,5,B000NV8I0U,"The Creating a Fairy Figure gave absolutely wonderful instructions on polymer dolls.  The CD was 2 hours long and Wendy delivered her presentation in a quiet and dedicated manner.  She gave complete instruction on how to make a doll from scratch,even showing extra versions as she progressed.  There were a few times I wanted to walk around her or look over her shoulder but the majority of the time I was simply the awed student. I recommend the CD wholeheartedly.",1309132800,2,465,4.7875
8181474,5,B000NV8I0U,"This DVD is an excellent addition to the resource library of any would-be sculptor in Polymer Clay.  I'm sure the techniques would work just as well in other sculpting materials.  The viewer sees the work in progress, mostly as if you were looking over her shoulder, in other words, as you would be looking at the sculpt if you were doing it yourself.

Wendy gives clear instruction in a real-time setting.  She does not go off-camera for a lot of ""Szhoozing"".  I personally find the fact that it's in real-time very helpful, as she shows you the complete sculpt from armature to finished doll, including costuming; painting; and, wigging.  In particular, the costuming section is very interesting, as there is not a lot of information out there on dressing your dolls for those learning to sculpt art dolls/fantasy figures.

Because Wendy does not disappear off-screen to do little touches, you are not left with a new view of the sculpt, but no idea how to get to that next step.  This is very helpful.  She is very clear in her instructions, and teaches in a pleasant easy-to-watch manner.  As a beginner sculptor with no easy access to courses, this is a really useful resource, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to others.  I have just gone back on Amazon and ordered the follow up DVD, Creating A Character Figure With Wendy Froud.  Definitely a good investment.",1308787200,6,1375,4.73109243697479
