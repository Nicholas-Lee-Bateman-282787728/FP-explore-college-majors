2247856,5,B0007XBMG6,The movie was really good. It says on the cover the hottest clubbing scenes in London ever caught on tape. I mean it explores the London rave circuit which according to me is on of the best.,1132185600,2,190,4.162162162162162
2247857,5,B0007XBMG6,"I first viewed SORTED in London in May of 2000 during it's release to the U.K. theatrical market.  Frankly, I was surprised that it took over 5-years for this indie gem to find U.S. distribution, and my hat's off to Ardustry for making the commitment.  This is not an ""easy"" film per se, as the issues of Rave-Scene drug use, promiscuous sexual activities of super-model types and a murder-mystery-plot to drive the action are not ""PG"" material.  But the aluring performances by Fay Masterson opposite Matthew Rhys show promise of big things to come for both young actors, and set ""SORTED"" apart from typical indie-film fare.  Check it out, it's a keeper!",1116892800,7,655,4.821428571428571
8053233,3,B0007XBMG6,"i bought this to see what matthew rhys  work was like a few years before the americans and was glad I did. I guess he's what's called a natural actor. in this film, and in several others he did a few years ago he seems to seamlessly create a character different from the others.  you can never catch him acting.  well, this movie was so-so, but the acting was fine. I might watch it again or not.",1514332800,,396,4.116883116883117
8053234,3,B0007XBMG6,"a rather weak story, it's relying heavily on all the niteclub scenes and the disco music......not muck else to keep you interested.",1379980800,,131,5.0
8053235,3,B0007XBMG6,"This was an okay story, nothing to write home about but it was okay,  I purchased it for my Tim Curry collection.",1354924800,,113,4.136363636363637
8053236,4,B0007XBMG6,"This was a very unusual film as it is almost exclusively filmed in bizarre underground clubs in London.  As a huge Matthew Rhys fan, he again does not dissapoint and does an excellent job bringing his wit, and charm to this role. The music is very 80-ish techno punk and plays throughout the film, if that deters or sways you to see the film.",1308528000,,342,4.34375
8053237,5,B0007XBMG6,I mainly bought this movie because it starred Tim Curry( which i don't understand why his name isn't first on the cast listing but anyways). The plot was fantastic and the cast was phenomenal. Tim Curry was exceptional as usual as Dameon. Im not gonna even try to describe the movie becuse it would not do justice to the movie. Deffinatly a must see.,1293840000,,350,4.484375
8053238,5,B0007XBMG6,"This movie was spectacular and captivating... I really recommend everyone watch it.
And the title should be changed from Tim Curry to Matthew Rhys, he is after all the starring role in the movie and the best actor worth mentioning.",1262995200,,231,4.8
8053239,2,B0007XBMG6,"A movie with a plot and setting that had potential but which sadly deteriorated into a mini-me version of Dr. No. Tim Curry's evil bad guy character was comical. He belonged in a farce or satire. I think this was supposed to be a serious drama. The ending credits are interspersed with light-hearted quick scenes of the characters in whimsical situations which were supposed to be endearing, I guess. That should give you a clue as to how bad and unintelligent the plot became. Too many flashing lights affects the brain, perhaps.",1228521600,,530,4.771739130434782
8053240,4,B0007XBMG6,"Unfortunately the region 1 dvd is missing the load of extras contained on the U.K. region 2 release.

The first part of the film, we meet ""Carl,"" who has come to London to sort out his brother's belongings and also look into the death of his brother, who'd taken a drug-addled dive off a skyscraper during the night of a rave.  He quickly meets his brother's girlfriend, and the two are instantly attracted to each other, as they unofficially date by having the excuse of bonding together in order to solve the mysteries of the departed ""Justin's"" life.  In more than one way, Carl is intent on sorting out his brother's effects.  What happens along the way is the suited well-coiffed Carl is liberated, at least for the time being, the excuse his willing seduction into the strobe-lit, drug and danced fueled world his brother frequented.  He takes rather easily into this new lifestyle, enjoying his brother's expensive set of wheels and apartment, and is soon placated that his brother's death was an accident after all:  He simply has new sensations and people on his mind now, and you can start worrying that he too might suffer a miserable end.

A highlight is the actor playing the cross-dressing ""Michael"" - who takes to Carl, and one can read attraction into it, as well as a certain fondness and also protectiveness, but nothing overt.  The leading ladies are vying for Carl's affection as well, but are there ulterior motives in this?  This is the kind of film where you can't take for granted what's at face value - or can you?

The standout is lead Matthew Rhys, in yet another accent by this Welshman, who is finally gaining some long overdue recognition in the States due to his co-starring role in the ABC series BROTHERS AND SISTERS.  His typical acting style is understated, yet he is always in the moment and you can see every thought in his head.  Also, he is certainly a stunning-looking man (he would have been mid-twenties at the time of filming) as he's obviously well-suited for color as opposed to black and white with those crisp blue eyes and red full lips and pale skin with dark hair.  Regardless of the leading ladies, he is the best-looking thing on the screen and your eyes naturally find him even in crowded club scenes.

Tim Curry as the villain is very typical here, nothing special either way in his performance - perhaps he is reserved as opposed to being over-the-top. As for the character's personal life, it wasn't fleshed-out adequately and I hadn't a clue what to make of him; surprisingly one or two dimensional, at best.

The second half of the film, unfortunately sacrifices some of the character development from the first half in order to propel the plot forward.  There are a few surprises in store for Carl and we are right there as he is finding things out and dealing with them.  One thing you can say for Carl, this thinking young man adapts to situations quickly and responds in the only intelligent way each time.  One has the idea his self-sacrificing nature - staying home with the parents and maintaining a career there, and foresaking the lights of London which lured his brother away - means he is forced to put others' needs ahead of his own, and maybe the situation just got more complicated, but he's still there to handle things.

The ending is unsatisfactory, as you're provided snippets when you've actually come to care about these characters and would like to spend more time with them.",1185148800,4,3454,4.688741721854305
8053241,4,B0007XBMG6,"Pretty intereting movie but the plot was not that great. It's a ""B""  movie. I would suggets renting it if possible.",1142294400,,115,4.476190476190476
8053242,3,B0007XBMG6,"Sorted is the story of a man investigating the suicide of his brother in London. What happens as a result is that he gets caught up in the night life and the world of clubs. There is alot to be hidden about his brother's mysterious death, as well as the company his brother was keeping. There are many interseting characters. My favorites were Sunny (played by Sienna Guillory), and Martin, a very intersting and colorful character. I don't like to ever give anything away. All I will say is that there is alot of suspense, and the soundtrack is very good as well. The only weak spot for me was the ending. The prtrayal of club life was dead on because the director of the film is a former DJ. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for suspense and a story that for the most part is well told. It does have a couple of holes in it, but will entertain for the most part. I give it 3 stars.",1141257600,,891,4.216374269005848
