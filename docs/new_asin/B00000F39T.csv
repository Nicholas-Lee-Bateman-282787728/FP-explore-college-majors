1201204,5,B00000F39T,"I saw this movie when I was young, and I have never been more terrified! I would consider myself a ""horror buff"", and this is the only movie that gives me the total creeps! Sally is being terrorozed by demons that were unleashed from her blocked off fireplace... Nobody will listen to her, and the end is hard to watch with both eyes open! I just wish the movie was available to buy! What a great group flick,- nightmares for everyone!",983145600,4,435,4.382716049382716
1201205,5,B00000F39T,"I remember seeing ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" on TV when I was a kid. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark was originally made for TV back in 1973. There are movies that stick with you for the rest of your life- this movie stuck with me!! It's the creepiest movie that I have ever seen. I saw it a few years ago on late night TV and it scared me just as much as it did when I was a kid!!  Don't Be Afraid of the Dark starts with a young couple inheriting an old victorian style house. They don't know that the house is inhabited by three small demons that are locked in a blocked off fireplace.  The caretaker, played by William Demarest(Uncle Charlie from ""My Three Sons"") warns Sally,played by Kim Darby, that some things are better left alone when she wants the old fireplace opened up. Sally attempts to open the fireplace thus releasing the three small demons into the house. They then want her for thier own. Strange things begin to happen around the house and Sally at first begins to question her own sanity. She sees the demons and her husband Alex, played by Jim Hutton, does not believe her.  I think the scariest part of this movie is how vulnerable Sally feels. She cannot feel safe even at a dinner party (she sees one of the demons on her lap under a napkin)  The demons cannot stand light and only attack in the dark. I can still hear the whispering whenever I think of this movie. Sally.....Sally......Sally.....Sally.....  Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is the creepiest movie ever made. What amazes me the most is that it was made for TV!
  See it for yourself....with the lights on!!",979257600,235,1593,4.361486486486487

1201257,5,B00000F39T,Great classic made for tv movie. Would have been good enough for theaters. The remake was not even near the same. They never show it on tv so i had to buy it and i don't buy all that many movies,1473638400,,194,3.7560975609756095
1201276,4,B00000F39T,"To see this classic horror flick from 1973 on DVD at last is a pleasure. This was a fallow period for genre films, with serious filmmakers making serious, ""socially relevant"" movies and horror, adventure, and sci-fi falling on hard times. To compensate, it was a golden age for made-for-TV movies and many short, low-budget but impressive films were crafted and broadcast, only to fall through the cracks of home video thanks to copyright issues and perceived lack of interest. But many of these have become cult favorites and stand the test of time. I see many influences on later films from the unassuming but effective ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" so it's important from a cinematic history aspect as well as a rattling good piece of entertainment.  A young couple move into an old decrepit mansion and strange things begin to happen... not the most original concept, but developed here with skill and genuine creepiness. You will not sleep easy in your bed after seeing this!

The DVD transfer is a great improvement on earlier videotape releases, altho' the audio is muted and there are no subtitles. The only reason I deduct a star is for the abysmal commentary track, a grossly wasted opportunity (what, they couldn't get Kim Darby to do this???). Of all the hundreds of  commentaries in my DVD library, this one is easily the most retarded and offensive.  All these geeky fanboys can offer is a running, giggling, snarkfest that tells us NOTHING about this movie  -- they act like they haven't even seen it before at times -- and is a waste of everybody's time.  Hard to believe Warner's couldn't find anybody with something more to offer than this load of irritating garbage.",1473120000,4,1685,4.813148788927336

1201327,4,B00000F39T,"This is one of the ultimate hokey movies from back in the day when they were made for TV.  The picture is not very clear, but definitely watchable.  Because of the filming process, it looks like a soap opera with that 'hard' edge to it rather than a filmed theater version.  As a kid when I first saw it, it was scary.  Watching it with the commentary is really enjoyable because the guys are saying the same things you're thinking in your head.  There are plot holes big enough to drive a car through.  It's not a masterpiece: it's a classic, not very well made movie that you just have to watch again after seeing it all those years ago in the 70s.  It's not even bad enough to qualify for MST3K though.  Still, great fun and maybe a tiny bit scary.",1444435200,,751,4.23943661971831

1201440,5,B00000F39T,"This is seventies TV horror at its best. Aired in October 1973, ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"" was released on an unsuspecting throng of pre-adolescent kids and even scared adults.

Dan Curtis said it best in 2004 that films like ""The Night Stalker"" can't be made today because every TV movie has to be a message film. The same holds true for ""DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK!"". It is a simple, straight forward, horror flic with no message, no abject moral lesson to be learned (except maybe leave well enough alone). It's just a young woman against some tiny demons and the shadows of her newly purchased house. A big CREEPY house at that and director John Newland (One Step Beyond, Peyton Place, Dr. Kildare) leave us to guess at what the creatures look like long enough to stew in our own imaginations. Like ""JAWS"" what you do not see is often scarier than what you do.

The downer ending was a shocker in 1973. A time when we the audience expected the woman in distress, menaced by supernatural forces to be rescued in the nick of time, not tied up and dragged slowly to her doom. So viewers had to go to bed thinking that what happened to Sally...could happen to them!

""Dont be Afraid..."" is an often imitated film that influenced many of todays directors and rightly so. It left an impression on me. You're in THEIR house therefore you are in GREAT danger!",1416700800,2,1359,4.471774193548387

1201470,5,B00000F39T,"Like many others I saw this as a child, so as far as anything missing material I cant attest for that. I can say that this played well in my player. I can say that as a horror movie it is a very entertaining & fun film. It had been so many years ago when I saw it I had watched it on a Black & White T.V. so it was a treat to see it in color.  The demons are straight out of Alistair Crowley's sketch book! And as I watched this as an adult I see they got much more camera time than I remember them being shown years ago.  As far as a made for T.V. horror film this would be considered the ""Exorcist"" of the genre!!!  Yes the creep factor still remains as seen through adult eye's. But then again I do have a vivid imagination! As far as the whole D.V.D.-R issue this can not be blamed on Amazon.com as they tell you exactly what you are getting! Had I bought this in a store it states D.V.D on the cover so you should be thanking Amazon.com!!!  I also had a discussion with a trusted friend who used to work for a business that created D.V.D.-R burns & he told me if handled with care they should have the same shelf life as any D.V.D pressing. He said that as long as your player reads them they should play fine & that they are subject to the same problems as a official pressing, any damage like scratches on either side could destroy any C.D., D.V.D. or D.V.D.-R burns. I asked about the base material having a lesser shelf life & he said they are no different than the material used in making a ""Official pressing"" that it is more about the equipment reading the burn.  He would have nothing to gain by lying to me, he doesn't work there anymore!  I am happy to have this old memory back in my movie collection, right between ""Trilogy of Terror"" & ""The Gargoyles""!",1405468800,5,1770,4.101156069364162

Warner Bros. did a great job with it.  The sound is great, too.  And, it still gives me the creeps!  Nice scary movie.

The fact that I still wanted to see it again after all these years, speaks to what I thought of the movie.  It was creepy and enjoyable then, and though not as good as I remember it to be, I still enjoyed it.

In this age of special effects, kids will probably be disappointed with the film, but I was pleased with it.  I think that had I been seeing it for the first time, I would have really enjoyed it.

1201485,4,B00000F39T,"Made for tv in 1973, DONT BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is a chilling tale of terror about a woman named Sally Farnham (Kim Darby). Sally and her husband Alex (Jim Hutton) move into an old mansion inherited from Sallys recently deceased grandmother. Sally is in the process of redecorating the house, but there is a mysterious room in the basement that is locked. Sally discovers the key hidden away upstairs and unlocks the room. She discovers a very dark and secluded room that apparently used to be a study. The room includes a fireplace that is completely bricked up and a small side door for cleaning that is bolted shut. Sally requests that the handyman, Mr. Harris (William Demarest), who worked on the house while Sallys grandmother was alive, begin un-bricking the fireplace. Mr. Harris refuses, stating that there are things that are better off left alone and that he couldn't do it even if he wanted to because the fireplace is bricked six-feet deep with steel bars and concrete. After Mr. Harris leaves, Sally unbolts the side door and instead of a fireplace discovers a large, walled off horizontal shaft that descends into the subbasement. Shortly after, Sally begins hearing voices that call her name and she begins to see strange events happening at the corner of her eye, such as an ash tray falling off her night stand. It soon becomes clear that Sally is either going insane or she has unleashed something terrible from the fireplace.

For a tv movie made in 1973, DONT BE AFRAID OF THE DARK holds up incredibly well. Although the movie is a horror movie, it was made for the television and follows the codes of the time. These standards actually enhance the terror of what is seen. For instance, most of the violence occurs off screen and can only be heard and imagined. The imagination is far more powerful than anything that can be shown on screen. Darby gives a fine and nuanced performance as Sally and William Demarest as the handyman, Mr. Harris does well illustrating a man who knows far more than he will ever acknowledge. Jim Huttons portrayal of Alex is a bit stilted and lackluster until the films third act, but that has more to do with the way the character is written instead of Huttons acting.

Overall, DONT BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is an often-overlooked horror movie gem that despite being made for tv and having a low budget remains a chilling and creepy horror film. Modern audiences who enjoy torture porn might find DONT BE AFRAID OF THE DARK cheesy, but students of film and those who like classic horror will find plenty to enjoy.",1402876800,3,2563,4.668141592920354
1201486,3,B00000F39T,"The premise is very good-A woman slowly becomes aware that little demons are inhabiting her new-purchased home, and no one believes her until it's too late. The acting was good, and the demons are actually pretty creepy-looking(although I believe they become less menacing the more we see of them). I was aware of a few plot holes and unlikely behavior, such as scenes that are supposed to be taking place at night actually looking like they were shot in the daytime(The entire sequence where a person locked out of the house attempts to get back in comes to mind). One character drives to a house in an attempt to gather information that could easily have been obtained over the phone, which conveniently leaves the lead character alone with the demons. Overall, there were just enough scary and eerie moments to recommend this to others.",1402790400,,839,4.833333333333333

Really disappointed here.",1402272000,,402,4.676056338028169
1201488,3,B00000F39T,"This film was made for the 1973 season of the ABC Movie of the Week (Wednesday evenings).which filled a 1-1/2 hour (90 minute) time slot with original movies made specifically for television.broadcast. As such they were low budget, approx. $400k, and were shot in TV studios and sound stages, not cinema. As a 1973 film, it was done in 1.33:1 (aka ""Academy ratio"") for the 4:3 analog NTSC TVs on which it would be viewed. Run time is 74 minutes to fit into the 90 minute time slot with 18% (16 minutes) allocated to commercials and station breaks, the standard for that era (in 1980 it was 20%; today it's 30%). There is no widescreen original film. Because they were made for TV broadcast, these films also had to comply with the ""Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters,"" an industry code that was akin to cinema's Draconian ""Hays Code"" and even stricter in some aspects. It was set up to keep the Congress and FCC out of their knickers over objectionable content (which was continuously threatened). In spite of how mild broadcast TV was then, groups of people would complain (to FCC and elected govt. officials) about everything broadcast.

With that in mind, this one was right up to the boundaries of what was allowed in 1973 regarding its ""horror"" content. Note also that you NEVER see Hutton and Darby in bed together -- it's either one or the other -- and you hear most of the violence occur, but don't see it actually happen, just what it looks like afterward. There's also zero blood. This is actually one of the better ABC Weekly movies from the early 1970's and it deservedly has a cult following. In spite of the constraints which result in a fair amount of goofiness for a horror film, it still has some suspense and tension. I did not expect the ending which I won't describe as it would be an enormous spoiler.

Regarding the video and audio quality, the Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo audio is OK considering the original monaural made for 1973 era TV set lo-fidelity sound reproduction. High fidelity sound was just barely making it into some cinema theaters and the films were, for the most part, still monaural ; it would have been a complete waste of budget to do anything special. Video quality is the enormous disappointment. Dirt, hairs, emulsion pits, scratches and dropouts are quite prevalent throughout. Remastered? What was remastered? The film used for transfer was quite obviously not cleaned and nothing was done with the digital scan to deal with all the film flaws (e.g. scratches). Perhaps there was something done with the color, brightness, contrast and gamma. If so, it isn't evident. The only thing that had any special treatment was the audio. In spite of the specs and the DVD case (for the Remastered, Special Edition DVD), the audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo at 192 kbps, either from an original stereo sound recorded during filming, or the original monaural remixed. In any event it's obviously stereo and not 2-channel monaural.

The movie gets 3-1/2 stars as it's one of the better ABC ""Movie of The Week"" films from the early 1970's but it's not anything that would garner consideration for any awards, TV or cinema. Certainly worthy of its cult status though. The production design, props and special effects all reflect its budget and the need to film it very quickly (having to produce an original 1-1/4 hour movie per week). The technical aspects of the DVD transfer get 1-1/2 stars with a half-star up from just 1 for the decent stereo remix, but the shoddy video drags it way down.",1398816000,6,3537,4.738636363636363

The first time I saw this on TV I was scared silly, afraid to go to sleep, every whisper in the house suddenly became suspect.  Of course now, decades later, it seems rather tame.  A variation on the haunted house genre, this particular mansion has previous occupants residing in the fireplace.  They want out.  ""Set us free!""
I love how this movie starts with the disembodied voices of the little creatures paired with images of the empty house, continuing on with the voices of the new owners, as of yet also unseen.  It's a great story not used to its best advantage.  The pacing could have been better, the suspense tighter, the acting more uniform (Jim Hutton's bluster seems oddly extreme under the circumstances, while Kim Darby was almost complacent at times when fear was due).  I admit that my love for this movie is more sentimental and nostalgic than because of any artistic merit.  Still, it is a fun movie to watch as long as your expectations are clearly aligned with the realization that this was done for television back in 1973, the frights aren't going to be as graphic.

From the very start this movie grabs you, I'll credit that to an opening music score that heightens the tension throughout. The plot is simple enough, a couple moves in to an old house that has a mysterious past. We later come to find their home is inhabited by tiny prune-faced demons. I know, you've seen it before...but not like this. Yes, this movie is schlocky compared to today's standards. However, this is a prime example of how to make a horror film without using gratuitous violence. Less is always more, and in this case it works wonderfully. The acting from Miss Kim Darby (True Grit) and Jim Hutton (Timothy's Hutton's late father) is very convincing and over-wrought at the same time. Genius. The lighting is dark and the make-up ridiculous, but boy, is this film eerie. Side note: This movie was remade in 2011, a big budget disaster. Everything that made the original so fantastic was replaced with cliche'd thrills and cold CGI effects. If you are a film student and you want to make a great horror film with no budget, watch this.

Kim Darby (a girl with true grit) is cast as a woman besieged in her house by little minions, who proceed to terrorize her whenever her husband or friends are not around to hear her distress calls. This is sort of like one of the old ""Night Gallery"" programs, except it is a bit more frightening, with the dark music and dark photography, it's chilling! I guess some find the story silly, but I have always responded to this type of story better than ones that feature over the top violence. This is a clear cut case of psychology versus shocks and it works.
The Warner Archive DVD is good, with a great picture presentation and sound, but the audio commentary is a fan track--fun, but not essential.

Jim Hutton is billed on the back as having appeared in The Green Berets, which is itself one of the worst movies ever made; his performance here reminded me of the time my little sister put on a play using rocks for characters. The cover of this edition is misleading: the most emotion Kim Darby manages to conjure is the complete absence of emotion. The munchkin bad guys look like stuffed gorillas with walnuts for heads, and sound like a cross between the demon elf from Cat's Eye and a drunk man on helium. There was nothing compelling in the visual elements or the script. The only redeeming thing about the whole mess was the part when Barbara Anderson's character shined a flashlight on the side of the house in broad daylight.

Yet this is a quality product. The picture and sound have been cleaned up, even if they are not perfection. The item comes with artwork and a regular DVD case. I guess what makes this a SPECIAL EDITION is the fact that there is running commentary from three individuals who had nothing to do with making the film.

1201552,5,B00000F39T,"For those who first saw this film as a child, growing up in the 70s, I'm sure it left the same impression.
I was very young in 1973 when this ""Movie of The Week"" first showed itself on television. These were those long gone days  before the advent of video, dvds, cable, ect. Both myself, and older brother, happened to be alone in the house that evening. And being just kids we found the promos for ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" quite intriguing, to say the least. Nothing could have prepared me for the terror that this supernatual thriller would impress upon my young, undeveloped mind. Leave it to say, these demonic creatures, who were unknowingly released via a closed-up fireplace (*probably a gateway to hell itself*) unnerved me like nothing else before it. Kim Darby's character of Sally was in continual peril since opening up this ""Pandora's Box"". I remember both myself, and my brother, pleading loudly for Sally's husband, girlfriend, ""OR ANYBODY"" TO GET HER OUT OF THAT OLD CREEPY VICTORIAN HOUSE.
  Sadly for Sally, and all of us helplessly watching, this was not meant to be. Instead we watched in utter horror as Sally is literly dragged down to hell by these (*Hob-Goblins maybe??) satanic creatures. After this, I remember our mother turning off the lights when both me, and my brother, had gone to bed. But sure enough, when the coast was clear, one of us would jump up and turn those friggin' lights right back on. This only went on for about a month or six. I'd imagine that during the premiere of this film the surrounding electric companies must have made a fortune, scatching their heads, trying to figure out why?? I'm sure Con Ed made a bundle from our house alone. I have recently watched the film on dvd again after all these years. It still hasn't lost it's bite. I think before going to bed tonight I'll at least put in a new lightbuld and check the fuses for good measure. As far as the re-make is concerned, I never bothered with it and most likely never will. Just like the carpenter, Mr. Harris, had said in the original film; ""Some things are simply better left alone"", I most certainly agree. Anyway, it's getting dark.

When I finally saw it I was pleasantly surprised -- it holds up very well.  It's highly enjoyable and eerie with a couple of moments to make you jump.  There's no denying that it screams ""70's TV movie!"" but it works.  In fact, after watching it back to back with the 2010 version I can say that I preferred the original.  Obviously the remake has a bigger budget, much better FX, sets and production values (it's a pretty good fright film too) but the original beats it hands-down for spooky nostalgic fun.  Well worth seeing -- go get it!

A NOTE ON THE DVD:  Warner Archives has released this twice.  The older version (in a blue case with a small color photo) is very dark and murky.  It's hard to even see what's going on in some scenes.  Then, Warner remastered and re-released it when the remake came out.  The difference is like night and day.  The picture is bright and sharp with strong, vivid colors, there's no comparison at all.  Unfortunately there's no blu-ray available, but the DVD looks remarkably good for a TV movie from 1973.

Guillermo del Toro, who claims to be a huge fan of this 1974 film, completely ruined the remake.
But enough about crappy remakes, lets focus on the made for tv movie that made an impact
on me as a kid and obviously many others. It's the type of film that knows how to scare without all the in your
face blood and gore. Remember when our ""imagination"" was what scared us? Thats what this film represents.
The good ol' days when horror film / thrillers had good writing and knew how to scare us. If you're a fan of made for
tv films of the 70's and early 80's this is right up your alley! I still get goosbumps when I hear the creatures whispering: Sally...sally...saalllllly. As far as the new remastered disc is concerned, its stellar compared to the Warner Brothers
release back in 2010. The picture quality is superb....best I've ever seen it! Do yourself a favor and pick this one up

1201584,5,B00000F39T,"A humble housewife unwittingly unleashes a horde of evil creatures from beneath her new home in the 1973 made-for-TV movie DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK! Fear and paranoia reign supreme in this twisted tale that recently received the remake treatment thanks to Guillermo del Toro and director Troy Nixey. Kim Darby plays the unassuming Sally Farnham, whose curiosity gets the best of her when she betrays the handyman's warnings and opens the bolted furnace found in a secret study. We watch as she slowly begins to lose her mind as the small, rat-like creatures terrorize her in an attempt to steal her soul. Darby is fantastic in the role, truly selling her fear and anxiety while her husband dismisses her pleas for help as childish fantasy. Ed Graves' impressive production designs convincingly scale the monsters down to their miniature size, while the most frightening moments of the film arrive when the creatures beckon Sally with their wicked voices from deep within the darkness. DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is one of the finest Horror movies to debut on network television, and a hidden treasure that demands rediscover.

1201602,4,B00000F39T,"Way back in the day when television was interesting to watch, meaning before reality TV programs, they use to have what they called movies of the week. Usually an hour and a half in length and usually low budget these TV movies were sometimes not very good but a lot of times they could make some really good entertaining movies. One of those movies being ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"". Starring Kim Darby ( of ""True Grit"" fame) and Jim Hutton they play a young couple who has inherited an old house from a family member who died. Upon moving in Kim Darby finds a fireplace she would love to able to use except it is closed up with bricks and cement. Also the metal door use to open to clean out the chimmny is bolted shut with a warning from the local handyman not to try to open it under no circumstances. Of course you probably can figure out what happens next. Kim Darby's character, named Sally, just has to find a way to look inside the fireplace and is able to remove the bolt and open the door. Unknown to her there are three demon like critters that had been sealed up inside that has now be let loose and they are coming after Sally. From there I don't want to tell anymore about the plot for the benefit of anyone who has not seen the TV movie version of ""Don't Be Afriad Of The Dark"" or who may have seen it decades ago when it first on TV and don't remember what happens next.

I have read many reviews here on Amazon on the made for TV flick and by far the most common comment I read is how the reviewer first saw this movie as a kid and was scared to death by it. Count me among that group to. I would have been 17 myself when I saw the TV debut of ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" and it was one of the scariest movies I rememeber seeing at that time. It was well acted with good film editing that could give you a good creepy feeling while watching. The special effects were decent for the times. By todays standards many folks might say the special effects are cheesy at best. They might say the same thing to about the plot of the movie as well. You have to remember though that as a movie of the week there wasn't a hugh budget to work with. Plus they didn't have the luxury of time to put the film together and shoot it and certainly at that time didn't have the technical equipment on hand to make really outstanding special effects. Still with what they had to work with this is a first rate movie and I would have to agree with a statement I read about ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" that it is the best horror movie ever made for television. I would also rate it as one of the best overall made for TV movies ever filmed. I would rate it up there with some other made for TV movies like ""Trilogy Of Terror"" (starring Karen Black) and ""The Night Stalker"" (which would lead to the TV series ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" starring Darren McGavin). This is just good old fashion horror without the blood and guts flying all over the place like to be seen in many ot todays horror films. ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" plays on the imagination the way good horror should and lets the viewer create the terror in his or her own mind. If you saw this made for TV movie decades ago and loved it then you will enjoy it just as much today even if it doesn't chill you as much to the bone the way it use to.",1348444800,,3315,4.1157407407407405

1201607,5,B00000F39T,"Back in the 1970's, there was a curious art form known as the M.O.W.--Movie of the Week--which was a full length feature film that could be shown to a television audience without warning viewers to use discretion.  This posed a challenge for screenwriters and directors as to how you could make a movie appeal to adults without salty language, nudity--not even underpants--or quarts of stage blood pooling on the floor.  Add to this a very limited budget--since it would be shown for one night to a non-paying audience, with only the revenue from Rula Lenska's Alberto V05 hairspray commercials to cover the cost, and you've got a project that would reduce Martin Scorcese to tears.

With that in mind, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, is a homerun swing in MOW terms.  I saw it as a kid, and the daylights were scared out of me, and while I've become a teensy bit more jaded over the past 40 years, watching this film again still creeped me out.  It is definitely a ""door-checker""; (meaning that you're not going to sleep the night you watch this movie until you've gone through your house to make sure you didn't forget to lock the doors.)

The plot is pretty routine: a young couple moves into an old house.  There's something sinister and supernatural in the house, but the wife is the only one who can see it.  The husband takes off for a business trip, and the wife is left to confront the haint.  Sometimes the wife is thought to be suffering from some mental disorder, and most of the time, there's a supporting character of little consequence killed off to play up the danger, and invariably the heroine is given a sedative right before the final showdown.

All of this happens in Don't be Afraid of the Dark, and the predictability doesn't matter all that much, because the little goblins are so creepy.  I don't know if it's their onion-bulb heads or the little monkey hands, but it's very unsettling during the brief time they are shown on camera, and that's thanks to the low budget.  We're not talking state of the art special effects here--the goblins' mouths didn't move, and it was obvious they built oversized set pieces to make them look smaller.  However, if they had better makeup and better graphics, veteran TV director, John Newland might have been tempted to show the goblins more, and that would have killed it.  After things kick in, it's when you can't see those rascals that you really get the heebie jeebies.

The logic of what happens in Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and why the little goblins are there in the first place is a little sketchy, but the flashes of creepiness will draw you in, and Sally, (played by chubby-cheeked Kim Darby, the teenage cowgirl in the original; ""True Grit""), has a certain vulnerability that invites sympathy, even though there were about a million ways she could have avoided her predicament in the first 15 minutes.  (Which, of course, would have meant 1 hour and 45 minutes of Rula Lenska showing her American friends around London, and carpet-bombing her head with Alberto VO5.)

There were also parts of this movie that didn't faze me in the least when I was 6, that scared the holy hallelujah out of me the last time I saw it.  The husband, (Darren Stevens lookalike Jim Hutton),  obviously had borderline personality disorder, and would pop off at his wife and the handyman, (William Demerast, who was Uncle Charlie from the;""My Three Sons"", sit com), with little or no provocation.  Sally Fields' husband in; ""Not Without My Daughter"", was better balanced, and I guess it must have been more acceptable then for a guy to have a couple of drinks, yell and gesticulate at his wife, and then demand dinner than it is now.  He was far scarier than the little onion heads...Until the very end.

Will this movie thrill everybody?  No.  Sadly, Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg have all but exterminated our willingness to suspend disbelief for anything South of 30 million dollars.  I don't show this to my kids, not because I am concerned about nightmares, but I'm a little sick of the look they give me every time I throw a cult movie from my youth on the DVD player.  (Also, I don't want them to get the idea that their grandma and grandpa had that sort of relationship...even though some of it was pretty accurate.)  This movie is definitely for Cold War babies, and nobody else.  If you've seen a few MOW's but not this one, you owe it to yourself to get ""Don't Be Afraid..."", and if you did see it in '71, then...my bet is you already bought it.

If you want information about the film the ""audio commentary"" is a complete waste of time with very little info and way too much juvenile chatter so my advice is to avoid this; it is so bad I wonder why they bothered to pay those involved.

It was not a big budget theatre release, HELLO! Sure it has it's flaws, but overall a very good scare movie to watch on a rainy day, or just to add to your horror movie library. I am from the generation that saw the original TV release on broadcast TV, I must've been in the 3rd or 4th grade at the time. Don't know what Mom was thinking about that night, and allowed me to watch this. It is funny, because I have read many other reviews all saying essentially the same thing, that this movie deeply affected us as children of the 1970's. That in itself says something about this movie, that after all of these years, we still have memories of this film, and collectively seek it out to view again. It is the storyline and quite honestly, the creepiness of the whole idea of tiny little demons living in a sealed off fireplace, and no one believing you that is the essence of the scariness of the story. I actually thought the costumes were not bad, in fact very creative. I still to this day cannot figure out whether these creatures were demons, goblins, evil little elves or what. I somehow remembered them as little leprechaun like creatures, but they are anything but. ***FACTOIDS*** Felix Silla AKA ""Cousin Itt"" from the Addams Family is the head demon!! Also it is really great to see the starring role as none other than Kim Darby AKA ""Miri"" of Star Trek The Original Series fame!! I feel that I can give an unbiased review of this movie, because I really did not remember 90% of it, and recently saw it again for the first time in what, 39 years? I only remember being scared out of my wits, and the demons pulling  the main character down the fireplace, so the story and character acting was fresh for me, and a made for TV movie of the 1970's blows away the crap they spit out nowadays, even with all of the CGI special effects, todays movies just don't scare like these do. Of course you would have to actually be able to sit through an actual horror story, and be able to comprehend it. I would agree that in one of the final scenes there is a glaring flaw, an obviously nighttime scene shot in broad daylight, who knows what the reason was for this, could not have been an oversight, maybe they were under time pressures, and had to shoot it during the daytime? Bottom line: If you have memories of this film from the past, definitely a must buy. If you like horror films with a scary storyline, or involving a haunted old mansion, or retro horror, must buy also.  To the 20 somethings out there that have read the buzz about this film on the internet, it is true, however, like I stated above, it is what it is, so if seeing a special effect every 20 seconds is what defines a good horror film for you, stay away from this one, otherwise enjoy.",1335657600,6,2895,4.339483394833948

The one I'm looking for must be early or mid seventies and the plot is strangely similar.......there is a family in a house; their kids are photo sensitive (like the kids in ""the others""); therefore, they can only stand very low wattage bulbs. There is something in the fireplace, as well and you, as a fan, know that whenever the lights go out, those creatures are going to pull someone into the chimney (thus, kidnapping them into another dimension or killing them, etc.).

The creatures inside the chimney can't stand the light as well. I've been looking up for that movie for yeeeaaars and I came across this one, which is also great.

Could you experts, please help me.

It deals with the same spookiness as Trilogy of Terror, that Karen Black screamfest with the Kiwi dummy, or that dread Dead of Night with its ghoulish doppleganger.

This time around a young California couple are taut with fear over an infestation of supernatural critters. Kim Darby gives a vulnerable turn as a young wife, terrorized and pursued by a ruthless gathering of unwelcome guests, no bigger than the size of an average New York rat.

There are rather ham-fisted continuity errors and agregious gaps of logic (a day for night sequence gone horribly wrong), but still, even the weariest and hardest to impress horror fan would be taken aback by its aura and vibe.

Good old fashion cinematography prospective gives the tiny demons a grainy mysterious feel.  That's the extent of the special effects here basement bargain but relies more on suspense and tension than tricks.

I would not watch this movie at night, and some of the ideas expressed in the movie are definitely dated, but still a great afternoon watch. I would definitely recommend this to folks who love scary movies and don't want all the blood and guts.

1201687,5,B00000F39T,"Widely considered to be the best made-for-TV horror flick, Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark finally gets the lights turned on a little in this remastered edition from The Warner Archive. If you own this movie on VHS or the previous DVD incarnation, let me say that this is definitely worth the upgrade. You can actually see what is going on instead of just hearing it and seeing a dark, grainy screen. Is it perfect? No, but it looks pretty darn good for a 40 year old made for TV movie. A flick like this probably isn't going to win over many new fans in this day and age when people are used to lightning-quick-editing and digital effects but if you are in the mood for a creepy haunted house story, which emphasizes atmosphere, and a slow, suspenseful build, this is one you'll want to watch - alone, in the dark, with your cell phone off. Great acting, quick moving story, awesome ending!

The only complaint I have is that some scenes towards the end of the movie have not been remastered correctly, they were shot in the daytime and were supposed to be readjusted to look like night, but they forgot to do it in this edition and so we wind up with some ridiculously obvious daytime scenes that are supposed to pass for nighttime.

The only ""extras"" are a commentary by some ""fans"" of the movie which seems to me like a Mystery Science Theater 3000 type of thing that I have zero interest in.

Recommended for nostalgia purposes for people who saw it years ago, or for fans of 1970's haunted house creepers.",1314662400,14,1507,4.452898550724638

A neurotic housewife named Sally and her business exec husband move into Sally's family house, a spooky two story Victorian mansion. When Sally starts the redecorating along with her pompous decorator she comes across a locked room in the house. After arguing with the handyman who insists she should leave the room locked, she finally gets the key. But once she opens her father's old study and has the bricks from the fireplace removed, strange things begin to happen. Sally begins to see small creatures everywhere, but no one will believe her. Her husband dismisses her as neurotic and her friend thinks Sally may be losing her mind. But things take a deadly serious turn when the decorator trips at the top of the stairs and falls to his death. Sally sees a rope lying across the place where he tripped, but when she picks it up to take it, a horrifying little creature pulls it from her grasp. Is she crazy? Or has Sally released demons in the house, demons her father summoned?
These little puppets are terrorizing Kim Darby as she moves in to an old house left to her by her grandmother. These puppets have been locked away in a sealed fire place by Uncle Charlie from My Three sons.(William Demerest) Kim lets them out and the terrorizing begins. The puppets aren't scary. A ghost would have been much better. I'm sorry to rain on anyones parade, but this movie is miserable.

The burn-on-demand DVD quality is surprisingly decent -- far better than I expected. This was a made-for-TV movie and the production values were never amazing, but the pic and sound are clear and even the dark scenes read well (it helps if you dim the room lights, which you should do anyway to get the maximum effect out of the film).

The story to the movie is pretty basic. A couple move in to an old house that was owned by the woman's grandparents. Down in a study room there is an old fireplace that is sealed up for some reason. Eventually it is unsealed and Things escape and wreak havoc upon the couple, mostly the wife. They want her for some reason. The movie has a creepy undertone to it throughout the whole movie.

It is a generally dark looking movie with very few daytime scenes. It does have lots of slow parts with people standing around doing the drama thing (which I don't really mind in 70s / 80s movies for some reason) but the creeping menace is always right around the corner. The score is deeply disturbing and is ever present which really helps maintain the eerie mood. This scary flick culminates in a nail-biting ending that is truly nightmarish!

I guess maybe they don't realize how many people saw this back in the 70's and that the film has stuck with them all this time.  The DVD is a little on the dark side, and while I think another reviewer said that it was ""LOADED"" with scratches, I think that's a bit of an exaggeration.  There are a couple here and there, nothing particularly distracting.

Of course,  the story (if you don't know it) is that of a young couple that move to an big old inherited monster of a house.  The woman (Kim Darby) wants her grandfather's old study for ""her spot"", but is rather upset the fireplace has been bricked up.  And that the ash door is bolted shut.  Their handyman/carpenter, William Demarest, was hired to do all that years ago by grandma, and urges Darby to leave it alone and this room too, but of course you know she doesn't, and unwittingly sets free some little creatures that want her for their very own.

I may have seen this when it was first aired, because in the days before cable and video and all that, one did what one had to, to catch the weird or scary stuff in TV.  For a made-for-TV movie, it had quite an impact, and you can tell from the number of people that have reviewed it and remember it.  Which is what kind of upsets me that it wasn't given a PROPER DVD release.

Still though, my old VCR is not working so well these days, and my big box USA VHS tape of this film is kind of collecting dust, so it is nice to have this on DVD, even if only a DVD-r with no extras.

It's a dreadful copy---dark, grainy and loaded with scratches.

I had copied a video to DVD years ago and wanted to ""upgrade"" since my new BluRay tends to make video-to-DVD transfers a little ""watery"" -- and the transfer was never that great to begin with.

But I was really disappointed with this version. Because it takes place a lot in the dark or in shadows, it looks very ""blotchy"" and the blues all ""swarm together"" in a muddy mess.

If you have BluRay, you can see it attempting to ""upgrade"" so much of the original film has a cleaner video quality. But even the outdoor, sunlite scenes are terribly grainy around the edges.

The sound is fine but overall, a real disappointment. I know they didn't even ""try"" to clean up the film, but it looks so piss-poor you think that someone would have noticed and made and attempt to upgrade it a little.

And for those of us who remember it fondly as kids, it simply doesn't hold up at ALL when you see it as an adult, so it's best to skip and just hang on to your memories.",1261872000,13,1105,4.365853658536586

I made the 'mistake' (in the not-being-able-to-sleep plus being afraid to go down in my basement) of watching it when i was around 5, and it made such an impression on me (notably, the little green gremlin-like creatures) that at the age of 40, i popped for a copy of this on DVD to relive my childhood freakout, when i saw it was available.  I was not disappointed - this is a pretty good made-for-TV film, and achieves a bit of suspense as Sally tries to convince everyone that she's not crazy and is not hallucinating seeing the creatures.  There are a couple of minor plot holes (which i won't get into here, at the risk of spoiling stuff from the film) but overall, if you're into 70's horror, this is a pretty good film, if a bit tame by today's standards.  The creatures are pretty cool looking.  This film would probably be a good candidate for a remake today, with better effects and a bit of a more macabre director's vision.

This is part of the Warner Archives series - made-to-order DVD's in DVD-R form.  There are really no extras (other than plugs for other titles in the WB Archives), and the movie chapter stops are in 10 minute increments (not necessarily by scenes) but the transfer itself is actually relatively clean (couple of scratches/etc) and exceeded my expectations, as i hadn't bought any titles in the WB Archives prior to this one.",1261612800,25,1437,4.503846153846154

It is more of an invasion of evil beings than of a paranormal force.

I saw this TV movie for the first time at about 7 years old and let me tell you - it completely changed the way I would enter or leave a dark room or hallway for years! I remember making running dashes from my bedroom to the hallway light switch (which was several feet into the darkness) as quick as possible before those little [...] could grab me and drag me into the fireplace. I had a mental map burned into my mind on how to navigate through my house turning on lamps and light switches to avoid being in the dark for more than a few seconds. Leaving in the dark was always worse than entering because I always had that skin crawling, hairs standing on the back of my neck sensation that the ""little people"" - as my brothers and I referred to them by - were right on my tail. My brother (4 years older than I and 6 years older than my younger brother) would torment us in the middle of the night making the whispering sounds of the demons and then scream - ""THE LITTLE PEOPLE JUST CAME OUT OF YOUR CLOSET!!! THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU!!!""

There's only one other movie - big screen or made for TV - that terrified as much as ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" and that was ""The Exorcist"".

ABC's Movie of the Week was working hard to draw viewers from NBC and CBS in the early 70's, and it worked. Many of the ABC TV flicks were high quality.  Of course, the budgets were very low.  But imaginations ran high, and talented filmmakers like Dan Curtis, Steven Speilberg and John Newland (One Step Beyond) decided to make a name for themselves using TV as their platform.

Newland helmed Don't be Afraid..., and the plot is very simple.  A young woman, who's had mental difficulties in the past, starts seeing tiny monsters in her brand new home.  Of course, her husband thinks she's having another breakdown. Why are these monsters after her? Who knows? Hitchcock would call the reason a MacGuffin (a plot device that keeps the story moving, but is not important in itself).

Newland keeps the house VERY dark, to create atmosphere and also to hide certain shortcomings.  But the movie works on a psychological level.  A child's fear of the dark (the vast majority of the viewing audience had to be under 18). Simple, and very effective.

As far as the DVD, this is the only TV movie of that era and genre yet to be released.  I'd say it's just a matter of time.  Remember Sally's last words: ""We have all the time in the world.."" Brrrrrrrrrrr!",1180396800,4,1420,4.636
1201875,5,B00000F39T,"I recall this horror/suspense gem from a long time ago and have awaited it's release to DVD-

A neurotic housewife named Sally (Kim Darby)and her business exec husband (Jim Hutton) move into Sally's family house, a spooky two story Victorian mansion. When Sally starts the redecorating along with her pompous decorator she comes across a locked room in the house. After arguing with the handyman (William Demarest ""Uncle Charlie"" on ""My Three Sons)who insists she should leave the room locked, she finally gets the key. But once she opens her father's old study and has the bricks from the fireplace removed, strange things begin to happen. Sally begins to see small creatures everywhere, but no one will believe her. Her husband dismisses her as neurotic and her friend thinks Sally may be loosing her mind. But things take a deadly serious turn when the decorator trips at the top of the stairs and falls to his death. Sally sees a rope lying across the place where he tripped, but when she picks it up to take it, a horrifying little creature pulls it from her grasp. Is she crazy? Or has Sally released demons in the house, demons her father summoned?

This is one of the best '70's suspense movies that was made for TV (or even the theater!) and still has yet to be released to DVD.

1201951,5,B00000F39T,"I was a kid growing up on the island of St. Thomas,U.S.V.I.
when I saw this movie. It was broadcast from the 40 mile distant island of St. Croix on channel 8. The islands were nowhere near getting cable t.v. In those days,everything came in on the airwave UHF band.
About 13 at the time,I was a certified N.A.U.I. diver with a considerable amount of bottom time,(I literally dove every day).Thought I was pretty tough for a kid. Till I saw this movie...
My parents were off island,I was more or less on  my own,(It was a different time.) sat back and watched this thing on the tuesday night movie of the week.
You can become indifferent to T.V. after a while,putting the broadcast on the background while you do chores or whatever. This movie got my attention immediately. Its pace was different,the unidentifiable sense of dread drew me in.
I was a veteran of all the horror classics of the time. Thought (and still do) that the genre was very underrated. Still,""Dark"" caught me off guard.
Such a nightmare like quality,the unknowing unease,the horror of discovery,the trapped panic of the encounters and the subsequent guerrilla like attacks wove a tapestry that was unlike anything I'd seen. The fact that the director didn't show the creatures all the time,made them...low tech that they might be...more scary than they really were. There wasn't a need for special effects of the T.V. kind,this could have just as easily been done on a stage. It had a reality to it.
At the end (like a bad acid experience)I was traumatized,exhausted and confused. The elation I felt from the experience of something decent on T.V. and the ""Man, I gotta get the hell outta here"" sense of unease that resulted, was pulling me in two different ways.(years later, when I found a copy,I actually hesitated on buying it.)It was the first time that something produced for T.V. entertained me. I wasn't use to it.
In those days, ours was the only house on that part of the island. An old,old,old,Danish place from the sugar cane days,so high up in the hills,we couldn't even get a phone line installed.
W.A.P.A., the local water and power authority,had a lot of problems back then. We had ""blackouts"" all the time. Just as I was recovering from the mental and physical beating that""Dark"" had given me...The power goes out. This movie took something that was mundane and harmless,and made it really pretty freaky.
The power didn't come back on till 4 a.m. I did manage to sleep,
but only with my back to the wall. Later...when my mom asked me why I had a flashlight taped to my speargun,I could only smile and say it was just an idea.
I still watch this movie from time to time, and I do manage to sleep with the lights out. But then it is easier,what with my M-4 with the surefire light attached. I just know that they're out there...
As a post script, I would like to point out that I have written this review previously. But someone,for some neurotic reason, felt somehow offened by my opinion, and complained to Amazon.
So due to that persons shallow sensibilities,I have to rewrite this review for this really cool little movie.",1109721600,2,3112,4.658181818181818

I am soon to be 40, and can safely say that no other horror flick had such an impact on my ""under the bed"" fears. And I've seen them ALL over the years. This one tops the list for biggest impact. ""Dark"" has everything. Evil music and a cats meow start things off in the right direction. A victorian mansion, a sensitive, vulnerable woman and dark (some very dark) rooms keep our moods set. There are very little relaxation scenes. No comedy to help relieve the tension.
  Kim Darby is excellent. Her acting holds this movie from being a forgotten throw away. But it is those three little guys, those "" can't live with them, certianly can live WITHOUT them "" goulies that make this gem memerable!
  When Sally see's one for the first time under the table and lets out that scream. Her paranoia has reached a new level. But she is still alone in hear beliefs and fears.

Here is a movie that takes the time to build up the suspense and terror. It was a masterpiece, even with commercials.

Kim Darby was so believable as the emotionally fragile Sally, a woman who thinks she is losing her mind...but we know the truth. We see it slowly unfold from scene to scene, and we go along with her on the nightmare that we will never forget.

The setting of this movie is classic. It is a spooky old house with a spooky dark basement. The suspense builds. A woman is trying to recover from an emotional breakdown and she doesn't quite trust her sanity yet. When things start to happen that are just... unbelievable, the husband, Jim Hutton is worried that his wife has gone over the deep end for good.

And again, it scared the hell outta me. Let's hope it will be released on DVD so I can buy it, watch it, and be scared to hell yet again!

There are 2 things I love about this film.

The first is that the ""creatures"" are shown very rarely, and when they do appear, it's done to startle you. You never really get a long enough look at them to see what they are or how good the make-up effects are, BUT they scare you evertime. There's also a spiritual thing about them, like they're ghosts of some sort. Only Sally sees and hears them calling her name (which also creeped me out-nothing like going to bed and hearing your name being whispered).

Secondly, I love the fact that the antagonist (the creatures/ghosts in this case) wins in the end. In most horror films the antagonist loses, gets killed, or is sent back to where it came from. And there's usually a sequel. Guess what? In this film the antagonist lives, the protagonist dies, and there is no sequel.

Enjoy. It's creepy as all hell. Don't turn out the lights whatever you do.

This is absolutely the number one best and most effective horror film I have ever seen, and that is including such films as ""The Exorcist"", ""Trilogy of Terror"" and ""The Omen""!! This was a simple made-for-TV film with a limited budget, but during the 1970's TV was still a MAJOR entertainment medium for actors both established and just starting out.  I thought that Kim Darby should have received an Emmy for her unique performance. Who can forget her bone chilling scream at the dinner party when she encounters one of the demons close up?? Unforgettable and really terrifying.  Jim Hutton as her career obsessed husband was a perfect touch, and William Demarest as the handyman was very effective. But let us not forget the three hairy demons....chilling!! I was eight year old when I first saw this and I am now 39 years old and their appearance STILL scares me to this day. What is so incredible is that there is not a horror movie today with one third of the potential as this 1970's gem.  Today you have limitless computer technology (CGI) and various other methods of special effects and they pale in comparison to what three actors in rubber suits accomplished in this movie.  Amazing.

I was shocked that I remembered so many scenes from this little TV-movie that I hadn't seen in over 20 years.  This shows what an effective movie this was.  Some of the more vivid (and frightening) images had somehow stayed with me since childhood.  One scene in particular, in which the two little demon thingies are preparing to venture out from their dark crawlspace, whispering furtively, ""Let's get her"" over and over really stuck with me (and probably kept me up several nights as a child).
One reviewer was wondering whether the effects would look cheesy after so many years.  Well, I'll admit, the movie does look a bit dated, but not detrimentally so.  The creepy mood, atmosphere, and feelings of dread are all still intact (at least, they were for me.)

1202121,5,B00000F39T,"One of the best of the early 1970s T.V. horror movies.
Newlyweds Kim Darby and Jim Hutton inherit Darby's recently deceased grandmother's house, where her grandfather mysteriously disappeared decades ago.  Darby wants to open the bricked-up basement fireplace to convert the room into a study, but old family handyman William Demarest adamantly opposes the idea, insisiting that ""some things are best left alone.""  She opens it anyway, and soon finds herself bedeviled at night by three little green men now released from their prison.  They whisper to her and laugh, menace her with straight-razors, and even murder the interior decorator before anyone begins to believe she isn't imagining seeing the nasty little things.  Darby's friend, Barbara Anderson, and handyman Demarest, try to convince Hutton before it's too late that his wife's life is in grave danger.  In fact, whatever the little men have in store for her might be even worse  -  they seem to want to take Darby away with them forever, even if they have to do so with her kicking and screaming the whole way...
This movie succeeds for a number of reasons, one of which is its short-story brevity  -  it runs only seventy-two minutes  -  which keeps the suspense and the atmosphere menacing, throughout.  The production itself is gorgeous, with good use of light and shadow and an especially eerie Billy Goldenberg score.  The performers are all terrific  -  Darby, especially, who never turns in a poor performance, and Demarest as the haunted man who knows much more than he can safely reveal.  The little gremlins are downright upsetting, and the effects used to make them look so small are pretty convincing.  The story concludes with most of its own questions unanswered, leaving the viewer deeply unsettled by the movie's chillingly creepy ambiguous ending.
On an interesting side-note, this shuddery human-abducting little-green-men story was released three weeks before Halloween, at the height of the biggest UFO wave ever seen in the United States.",1031788800,14,2024,5.121951219512195

Nobody has satisfactorily explained how Sally's father died in the old house.  Only handyman Harris (William Demarest, AKA ""Uncle Charlie"") appears to know the truth - and he's not talking.  (Demarest never looks happy, but he conveys a persistent attitude that things would be better for everybody if the Farnham's just moved out and sealed up the place).  Instead, Sally (Kim Darby who's made to appear prematurely frumpy) tries to unseals a mysteriously bricked-up fireplace in a darkened room deep within the house.  Opening up the ashbox, she does not realize that the sealed fireplace is really a prison, not for the cast of ""My Three Sons"" but for a race of homicidal imps.  They know who Sally is, and they've got plans for her.  But first they'll have some fun.  Soon learning that she's released something, something that can't stand light (whether because the creatures are too evil, or simply because they've been stuck in that darkened fireplace for too long), Sally refuses to stay in the dark.  Her upwardly mobile husband has no plans to leave the house (and walk away from equity?), and isn't about to listen to any stories of killer dwarves.  The imps put in appearances in the obligatory embarassing moments - like a doomed dinner party - but soon decide to dispatch their prey.  Sally has the light on her side, but this is a film with a dark bent, and Sally is pretty much outclassed.
This is one of those paradoxic movies of our 1970's youth - made for TV but more memorable than most feature films.  Whether it's ""Trilogy of Terror"", ""Gargoyles"", ""Salem's Lot"" or this flick, we've watched them wondering the same thing:  how did this flick make it to TV.  And more importantly, how does a TV flick which looks like a TV flick (down to the house, which was probably used countless times on Aaron Spelling shows and in other TV movies) manage to sustain such suspense?  Who cares - this is simply one more underappreciated classic that hasn't been seen on screen for years (basic cable is too busy repetedly running ""I know what you did"" movies).  The direction is perfect, showing us exactly what we need to see about the creatures, no more and no less.  The script is perfect also, actually benefiting from holes in the plot (like, why doesn't Demarest just tell Sally what happened - even if she can't believe in the imps, she can't ignore the fact of her father's strange death and the other weird stuff).  The connection between the creatures, their obsession for Sally and the house itself are perfectly kept obscure, leading up to a pulse pounding climax that Hollywood can't touch.  Supposedly, this flick is being remade for a 2004 release.  I'm expecting the full Hollywood treatment -CGI effects covering up an uninspired script - so stick with this version.",1030492800,13,2915,4.780439121756487

PS A friend of mine also found this film really great, and there aren't many films that phase her.",1028332800,3,531,3.7477477477477477
1202124,5,B00000F39T,"I was 6 years old when this movie aired on the tube and I remember a lot of begging and pleading to get my mom to let me watch it. I had to promise her I wouldn't have nightmares and wake her up in the middle of the night and finally she caved in. I remember my brother and I settling down in front of our big... Zenith (with the simulated wood cabinet) and I had no idea what I was in store for as it began... After the movie was over, I was terrified of the dark and I refused to sleep in my own bed for several nights. Even though I've always enjoyed horror movies, (and became a fan of horror fiction) this movie had such an effect on me, I had recurring nightmares about it well into my teens. And of course, it didn't help that my older brother knew it and used to tease me by saying ""I think I hear the little monkey people under your bed!"" Almost 26 years later I managed to get my hands on a rare copy and I was surprised to find it still creeped me out. It's a little campy and dated by today's standards, but few movies have come this close to making me pee in my pajamas. Highest recommendation!",1019865600,7,1107,3.990990990990991
1202125,5,B00000F39T,"This movie has stayed with me for many years. I seen this movie for the first time when I was 8yrs old on TV it creeped me out so much that I still sleep with a nightlight on. I have been looking for this movie for a very long time. All I can say is when you go to the FRIDG. late at night don't look on the side, just put a light on,because you never know what's there, and when taking a shower don't close your eyes. Those words ""CAN WE GET HER"" will stay with you and you'll never look at a center piece the same. See it and you will Know what I am talking about.",1019433600,4,566,3.764705882352941
1202126,5,B00000F39T,My sister and I had seen this movie when we were children on T.V.  It is definitely a spooker!!! We have been looking for it in stores for a long time... It will make you wonder if demons are real and among the living!!! I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good scare!,1001116800,2,275,4.0

1202128,5,B00000F39T,"One would be that this treasure gets released on VHS or DVD soon enough, Anchor Bay entertainment, MGM, are you reading this???? we need you!!!!! The other wish would be to see it on the big screen, can you imagine such an experience? I also saw it a couple of times on late TV when I was a kid, and I tell you, this movie still after more then 20 years gives me the crepiest nightmares. Later when I learned that is was made for TV, I just couldn't believe it, this movie is a true masterpiece for all horror fans and I just can't wait to see it again, to this day no movie has scared me as much as this one.",985824000,4,609,3.959349593495935

7906546,5,B00000F39T,Crystal clear scarier than the remake.  Young boy mid 70s Sunday night 1130 school night I would catch this movie it seems like every time it came on  million dollar movie  because it scared the hell out of me but Ive been without a TV guide you have no idea what was coming on it was kind a random I mustve seen this 20 times as a child I don't even know how thats possible cause me more nightmares in the exorcist  Damien  and Jason Michael Myers looking at it through grow eyes.  Dragin this girl down the steps no wonder this was made in the big film.  Probably haunted the directors childhood as well.  The clarity is far superior than the 10 inch black and white screen with the hanger sticking out the back of it its actually a really good quality picture for the source I have a 55 inch watch a Blu-ray and it takes nothing away from this movie its the best ever seen it. Finding this movie on Amazon made my week of been looking for for a couple years and constantly just seen a remake from various sources to actually come across it and its this quality some of the older TV movies I found on the script or glorified bootlegs this is not that it even has audio commentary which Im looking forward to,1522800000,,1209,4.203463203463204

7906552,4,B00000F39T,"This was one of my favorite shows when I was a child . . . it made a HUGE impact on my young psyche, and has lingered in my memory all these years. Rewatching it after a couple of decades was an interesting experience. I still really enjoyed it - it's creepy, and the acting performances are fine. It was also super fun to see those little monsters again after all these years (their mouths don't even open, which at the time made them even creepier. Now, looking back, I suspect that might have been more related to logistics and a low budget, but oh well). The verdict - I still love this film, but my son (this was his first time seeing it) wasn't all that impressed. So, probably this is one that hasn't quite stood the test of time, but I think it's worth watching for the nostalgia value alone.",1511481600,,800,4.269736842105263
7906553,4,B00000F39T,"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark provided many creepy chills watching it a youngster in the 1970s.  It still has creepy moments as an adult viewer though you'll pick on the plot-holes and Sally's marital relationship with her husband.  But its still worth watching and the quality of the DVD is quite good.

I am disappointed with the only special feature which is a commentary from three guys who had nothing to do with the making of the film.  While they clearly like Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and horror films in general they offer no insight about the making of this film.  It would have been nice to learn about how the story came about.  Who came up with the idea for this movie?  Is the plot based on any original source material?  An actual event?  Anything?",1508630400,,763,4.431654676258993
