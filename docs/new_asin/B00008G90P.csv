7984023,1,B00008G90P,"I really expected a hell of a lot more from Berkley Schools. It appears that the Dean of the school must have made the percussion instructor agree to put out something, anything to make the school money. It is painfully obvious that the teacher is not interested in making a video. I'm sure he is a fine musician in his own right, but I would never want to be in his class. You know what they say, if you can't do, teach.
Video is not worth the money.",1329091200,,451,4.136363636363637
7984024,5,B00008G90P,"I previously bought Brad Dutz' DVD (at the suggestion of the guy who sold me my bongos) and found it to be worthless; geared towards children and with MINIMAL instructions; in contrast, on this DVD, Ricardo breaks it all down to basics on bongos, claves, congas, timbales and does it clearly and simply.  This an excellent introduction to the rhythms and instruments that have captured my attention and excite me to play. I can't really imagine one being better. If you're starting out, like me, you can't go wrong with Ricardo's DVD.",1273536000,6,534,4.804347826086956
7984025,3,B00008G90P,"I had a very pad experience with another buyer about 2 weeks before ordering this DVD, so i was alittle aprehensive.  Needless to say the DVD was delivered to me within a week and in excellent condition.  This seller was spectacular.  Thank you Carmen",1252195200,,251,4.659090909090909
7984026,5,B00008G90P,"....if you're getting this because you're a composer, you should be forwarned that there is no instruction on how to notate these rhythms. Of course, this isn't a problem for the clave where there is basically only one timbre, but for the congas and bongos where you're taught to use your palm for one sound, your thumb for another, when to use the high drum and when the low one, I'm left with no idea how to notate this. However, I would still recommend it to composers; I'm sure somewhere on the Internet we can find the proper notation.

I'm still giving it five stars though because it *is* good and I realize I'm not the intended audience. If you're a percussionist interested in Afro-Cuban rhythms, this disc will be vrey worthwhile.",1158796800,3,740,4.606060606060606
7984027,4,B00008G90P,"Targeted at Beginners.

Excellent intro to a number of instruments (6+ selected via chapter menu).

Very good for someone who wants a foundation/taster to the principal Latin percussion instruments.

Shame it does not also include notes for the patterns used, surprising coming from the Berklee School of Music. !!!

Covers the following CLAVE (2-3 & 3-2), CONGAS (Tumbao & Mambo/Guajira), TIMBALES (Cascara & Mambo), BONGOS (Martillo), GUIRO, CAMPANA-Bell(MAMBO, SON/BONGO sic), DRUMSET Snare Drum combination.

When you have finished with this then you will be ready for the play along version 'The Rythmic Construction of a Salsa Tune' Vol 1 with Pablo Chino Nunez [Latin Percussion] ISBN:0757915558

The play along section could be beefed up along with the addition of sheet muic - VERY WORTHWHILE DVD - a THANKS to all involved.

Also an excellent book+CD is 'From Afro Cuban Music to Salsa' by Dr. Olavo Rodriguez [Piranha Berlin]ISBN:3980586308, 'The Rythmic construction of a salsa tune' with Pablo Chino Nunez[WB]ISBN:0757915558, 'Conga Drumming' by Dworsky & Sansby ISBN:0963880101.",1144540800,10,1092,5.542168674698795
7984028,5,B00008G90P,"I was expecting something completely different from this DVD. The majority of the instructional DVD's I have purchased have been hard to follow, impersonal and fast-paced. At the end of the DVD I usually find myself more confused and frustrated than when i began.

This was not the case for this DVD. Ricardo Monzon makes you feel as if he's giving you a private lesson. His steady pace and gradual progression is easy and enjoyable to follow. More than anything else, I was surprised by how well I was playing by the end of the DVD. Be beginning slowly, and estblising a solid foundation, I was able to create a variety of different rhythmic combinations. I recommend this DVD to anyone, regardles of your level of ability.",1107216000,20,724,4.700787401574803
7984029,4,B00008G90P,"A Berklee professor and Afro Cuban master, Ricardo Monzn breaks down several Afro Cuban rhythms into easily digestible lessons. Monzn covers rhythms on the congas, timbales, bongos, guiro, cowbells, and other hand percussion instruments.

The first few lessons teaches you how to play a clave pattern with your hands. Monzn starts off slowly so it is easy to follow along even if you have no experience playing Afro Cuban rhythms.  Perhaps the best part of the DVD are the conga lessons during which he teaches you how to produce a neat palette of sounds by strike the head on different areas using different parts of your hand.  Multiple camera angles and hand close ups make it even easier to follow along.  All the lessons are progressive, so what you learn in one lesson you will use in the following lessons.  This keeps building and it all comes together when Monzn performs a drumset solo using everything he covered.

Monzn's patient demeanor and thorough explanations make you feel as a personal student of his.  The patterns covered are basic enough that a beginner can learn them but interesting enough to keep you focused.  This is a great DVD throughout.",1095292800,15,1167,4.858585858585859
