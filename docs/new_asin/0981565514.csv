I can now do maintenance and most repairs on the Featherweight myself and save the time and expence of taking the machine to a repair shop. The instructions for removing the smell and improving the appearance of the case made it possible to use the case and keep it indoors. The instructions for cleaning and shining make the machine look nearly new.
