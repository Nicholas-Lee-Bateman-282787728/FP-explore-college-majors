The story and the development of the characters though was the lovely, complex even if ultimately a bit depressing at the end.  However, I suspect such an affair between officer and ward would indeed have a sad ending.  The acting was very believable and I've been fortunate enough to see similar sincerity in several submissives eyes in my own life. Her reluctance yet embracing of her role felt honest to me and should serve as a warning for wouldbe subs who attempt to intrigue those whom they think are vanilla.  I was not disappointed at all in the film though personally I would have had a far more positive, for Elsa and Jan, ending.",1201478400,3,717,4.492307692307692
2883947,4,B000SAAPFM,"The main character is very beautiful, but frustratingly the camera work carefully avoids showing much of him.  That's the only thing keeping this from 5 stars.  However it is a good story, entertaining & believable.",1199232000,2,215,5.114285714285714
2883948,3,B000SAAPFM,"The performance by the young actor Kostja Ullman made the movie worth watching, but I really didn't find this rest of the movie worth the effort. This is a intriguing but not compelling movie that is sort of weird in the way some European movies are.. The idea of a sadomasochistic affair between a 50 year old women and a 16 year old boy as beautiful as the actor, Kostja Ullman was unbelievable to me, despite the excellent performances by the main actors. Check out Ullman in the movie, Summer Storm, but skip this movie unless you are into beautiful boys or voyeuristic explorations of degradation of young men by old women or maybe weird European movies.",1197936000,9,659,4.641025641025641
2883949,4,B000SAAPFM,"PUNISH ME (VERFOLGT), aptly photographed in rich black and white, is a deftly made German film that raises as many questions as disturbing thoughts, a film that in every definition is a film noir - and a superb one at that. Writer Susanne Billig and director Angelina Maccarone (note: two very talented women!) have concocted a tale of disparate matching between a 50-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy, a relationship that builds on sadomasochism as a means of filling voids in each character.  The story could easily have become 'sensational' in less sensitive hands, but here, with the sound help of a superb and wholly credible cast, it asks us to examine the extremes to which people will go to feel complete.

Jan Winkler (the gifted and inordinately handsome Kostja Ullmann) is 16 and on probation for petty crimes.  He is assigned to parole officer Elsa Seifert (the fine actress Maren Kroymann), a 50-year-old frustrated woman in a marriage that has stagnated.  Jan feels a strange attraction to Elsa, an act that at first Elsa rebuffs and discourages but gradually becomes fascinated with the attention and seductive behavior of the young Jan. Committed to helping Jan she manages to talk her husband into employing Jan at his car repair shop the two males strike up a friendship.  In a series of subtle episodes Jan suggests his need for 'structuring' to Elsa: what he needs is Elsa to punish him physically, and when Elsa complies she is attracted to the process of sadomasochistic behavior (as the Dominatrix) as well as to the tenderness that always follows their dark sessions.  Elsa's husband discovers his wife's relationship with Jan while Jan's friends uncover the secret, and the resulting behavior and recriminations  flesh out the surprising ending.

Both Ullmann and Kroymann are outstanding in these difficult roles and manage to maintain our empathy and understanding throughout the story. Both are exceptional actors and both have compelling screen presence. The cinematography allows us to once again remember how powerful black and white film can be.  This is a film that some may find difficult to view (sadomasochism, teenage/older woman 'romance'), but the director keeps the story in tight rein and the result is a powerful tale of need and love and the sticky path that often joins the two feelings. Recommended.  In German with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, December 07",1197676800,14,2407,5.068354430379747

2883951,4,B000SAAPFM,"Enjoyed this different and unusual European film.  This movie again points out the difference in mores, American versus everyone else.  American Censorship has crept slowly and relentlessly along for the past forty years are so. Political correctness and Agenda media has reached
suffocating status in the states.  ""Midnight Cowboy"" in it's original
cut was X rated yet allowed to be released into lst run theaters.  That
could never happen now.  The latest thing that is to be banned is smoking, and use of the N word.
  I still need to learn how to locate the English on the selection
  There is some progress, the movie ""Suddenly"" was banned for over 40 years, staring Frank Sinatra is now available.
  The Walt Disney movie ""Song of the South"" remains off the market.

2883952,4,B000SAAPFM,"I thoroughly enjoyed this German movie.  The lead actress, Maren Kroymann, did a great job playing a tricky role.  I totally bought this unique, sado-masochistic, sexual relationship between the older woman and the very young man.  The sexual dynamic, with the older woman holding all the ""power"" and the young man as subservient boy toy (and often nude), very much appealed to me.  The young German actor, Kostja Ullmann, playing the boy was very, very sexy and beautiful, I remember him from the sweet German gay flick Summer Storm.  I truly hope we see more of this sexy young man in other similar flicks.",1193097600,11,608,4.8076923076923075

8204919,4,B000SAAPFM,"It is hard to rate this movie because of the subject matter. A young delinquent boy of 16, begins a slightly twisted affair with his Probation Officer who is trapped in a boring middle class life. Their affair is locked in the realm of B&D. The Probation officer need to feel something in her life, and needs a mean of getting her frustration with her routine life out. The boy provides the excuse to feel something more than middle class boredom.  The Boy probably has an abusive background because he easily submits to her discipline. Naturally such a twisted affair can only go wrong for the both of them.",1368489600,,608,4.577981651376147
8204920,4,B000SAAPFM,"""Punish Me"" is a German film that won the Golden Leopard prize at the 2006 Locarno Film Festival and features engaging performances from Kostja Ullman (Jan) and Maren Kroymann (Elsa). Beautifully filmed in stark black and white the film employs the power of film noir to great effect.

""Punish Me"" tells the story of a sadomasochistic love affair between a troubled sixteen year old boy and his 50 year old parole officer. The sexual tension between Elsa and her much younger paramour is palpable. Jan seems to intuitively sense that Elsa has an inner Dominatrix lying dormant within her. When he seduces her into dominance she is alternately transported and horrified by the feelings he awakens.

The doomed love affair between Jan and Elsa is very pure, almost innocent in its way. Their sexual encounters are limited to furtive corporal punishment scenes in which Elsa is fully clothed and Jan is naked to receive her lash. Their relationship ultimately comes unraveled but not before Jan confesses her affair to her estranged husband; speaking about the beautiful feelings it inspires in her with surprising eloquence.

""I am having a sadomasochistic affair with the boy. I hit him. He wants it. And I do to. He cries and I move around inside of him like in a blue room. And something inside of me opens up wide. I've never experienced anything like it. It's beautiful.""

In stark contrast to the vast majority of films about BDSM the protagonists in ""Punish Me"" are not cast as deviant psychopaths or emotional cripples. Rather they are two kinky people stumbling around in the dark on a journey of self discovery. Oddly it is the sixteen year old Jan who seems to be the knowledgeable and experienced one. Elsa struggles with the feelings his seduction inspires in her and often seems to find the realization of her sublimated desires deeply disturbing. The emotional cripples in the film are the rest of the vanilla world who are blind to the beauty and innocence of their relationship and ultimately condemn them for it. One can't help but be frustrated watching them experience just a taste of the potential they could have realized before everything falls apart.

I highly recommend ""Punish Me"". It is one of the few kink positive main stream movies I have seen and has the courage to delve beneath the surface and explore the desires and motivations of its characters while portraying them in a sympathetic and positive light.",1357344000,,2437,4.8768115942028984
8204921,5,B000SAAPFM,"I am telling you, I am not in to any boy under 30.  However the boy in this movie drew you in to the scene with him.  He not only seduces his probation office, but also seduces the audience.",1357171200,,190,3.8461538461538463
8204922,5,B000SAAPFM,"I am a bit reluctant to compare this the brilliant Reflection in a Golden Eye with its powerful cast of fine actors and fine director. But frankly Punish Me is the best film that I have seen exploring sexual repression and compulsion with some respect and compassion since that classic. Actually Punish Me leaves you with more to think about in terms of the complexity of the interactions between the older woman and the boy. While it may seem over the top on the surface, it leaves a lot of important questions about their inner workings in the shadows and open to being pondered. Belle de Jour is certainly provocative and deserves to be called a brilliant exploration of masochism. But it does not focus so much on the psychological dynamics of a sadomasochistic interactions between two persons as does Punish Me.

Any film that does a compelling job of encouraging an intelligent viewer to think about human complexity can be called art.

The artiness of this film is enhanced by the stark black and white photography. Many of the rooms have oddly blank walls if you think about it, which cuts potential distractions and leads you to focus on the characters. I liked the photography a lot. I think the actors and director and photographer did a lot with little drama and attention to nuances of facial expression and body language.

Actually I laughed several times but not because it was at all funny, but because it was very serious in a very German way. So it was like ""Yep they might really say it that way!! (I lived there for a year. They can be rather stern, serious, and sometimes what one might call philosophical) The older woman parol officer's conversations with her auto mechanic husband about sex and about her erotic relationship with the 16 year old boy were almost business like, which is not funny at all unless you recognize the cultural style in it. I raise this point not at all to suggest that viewers should try to see humor in the film, but to suggest that the human dimensions and style of presentation and pacing may seem more authentic, to flow more naturally, if you are used to German films. And if you are relaxed about this then it may be easier to try to get into the heads of the boy and his parol officer, which is the most provocative part of the film. Films like the Night Porter just sort of shove sadomasochism into your face and say, there is -- something in human nature. Okay. Films like Cruising are in my opinion mostly exploitive and again more or less shove it into your face and say look people can get sucked in, there it is -- dark temptation.  Then of course there is the whole vast genre of horror and slasher, serious killers etc. Not much to think about there. Escapism or whatever. This sort of thing is the bread and butter of the film industry of course. I am not being critical. It is what it is, and for a lot of people just their kind of fun or addiction or whatever. But Punish Me can leave you with a lot of questions about what can be going on in the depths of the human psyche. Well done in that respect for the patient and thoughtful viewer.",1301616000,2,3109,4.477954144620811
8204923,4,B000SAAPFM,"This is an interesting film, released in 2006. The Picture This! DVD followed in 2007, and has some basic special features, being subtitled in English and Spanish, with a Photo Galllery and two US trailers which seem identical to me.
As for the film, it features excellent performances from Hamburg born Kostja Ullmann as the 16/17 year old juvenile delinquent named Jan, who succeeds - by dint of sheer hard work - in so inflaming his 50 year old parole officer, convincingly played by Maren Kroymann, that she adopts a role opposite to that of Isabelle Hubert in The Piano Teacher - here it is she who succumbs to Jan's urgings to inflict bondage,pain and humiliation upon him.
Director Angelina Maccarone has chosen to shoot the film in black and white and it was nearly an hour before this struck me. I think the film works very well if one makes allowances for a number of plot implausibilities, and the excellent cast does a good job in compensating for these.
I am looking at the DVD cover, which features a sultry, bare chested Kostja Ullmann and I have to say that I didn't see this scene anywhere in the movie - is it a publicity shot to seduce the Summer Storm audience?",1283385600,,1181,4.5754716981132075
8204924,5,B000SAAPFM,"I got this movie because I had read on a website run by a submissive man that this movie comes closest to reality, in his experience, and I'm glad that I did. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The emotion and interaction between the two characters is intriguing, in no small part due to the actors' fine performances.

Jan is a juvenile delinquent who becomes obsessed with his 50 year old probation officer, Elsa, and they get into a sadomasochist relationship, but there is a lot more going on than simply that.  Jan knows exactly what he wants even if he might not understand why.  And it's not just about pain for him.  He is also thrilled by acts of submission and obedience, enthusiastically showering her feet with kisses and clearly taking sensual pleasure in doing whatever she asks when she issues her commands with the right tone.

Jan is just a boy and yet he has a man's confidence about what he needs (or thinks he needs).  And he is not afraid of it, any of it.  He unapologetically and without hesitation chooses her over friends several times.  In their intimate scenes together, he shifts so easily between his regular self and aroused anticipation, going from rolling a cigarette, to wide-eyed and panting, and back again without a hint of embarassment.  He buys a collar and leash for himself, wanting to belong to her, and he kisses her with such reverence that perhaps it is not merely an obsession after all.

I found it interesting that the movie hints that no one else seems to recognize this tendency in him, even the judge who has known him for 3 years and Elsa's husband.  Jan offers himself only to Elsa, as if he'd been waiting for someone like her to come along and claim him.

Elsa is at first reluctant to deal with him and initially believes that him following her is just him acting up for attention.  But interestingly she begins to understand what he wants without him having to actually tell her.  By the time of their first ""session"" he had made suggestive advances but he had not mentioned wanting to be hit.  She figured that part out on her own, so he was clearly right about her ""wanting to do things to him"" or at least having a predilection towards being a dominate woman.  The submissive nature of his clues might have gone unrecognized by another woman or been thought of as a joke.  She could have assumed that he was playing a cruel game with her but something in Elsa understood him.

I think that the reason why the writers of the movie choose to make the male character a 16 year old boy was that a boy was able to bring beauty and innocence to the relationship.  This helped to ensure that the audience wasn't as bogged down by preconceived notions about submissive men or worried about Elsa's safety with a strange man.  We get to see the tenderness and understanding behind these types of activities without being distracted by sex and fetish.

The ending of the movie was not quite disappointing but jarring, however we are too used to American movies that tell you everything that happens until they live happily ever after and also generally tell you what to think of everything too. A film like this is not trying to tell you the answers but ask you questions. At the end you are left in a place where you should be asking yourself what you wanted to happen between them.  Is this obsession or love?  Is it fair to dismiss his desire as confusion due to an unfortunate childhood combined with the sexual exuberance of youth?  In the end, he makes a dramatic gesture that reminds her that he is a child but do you really think he will grow out of this?  Is Jan's very final act yet another form of submission?

These questions are especially interesting if you know nothing about this lifestyle/desire or if you have feelings against it. You might be surprised by how you feel about Jan and/or Elsa and that's the point of the movie, IMHO.

On a side note, the German title of the movie, Verfolgt, means ""hounded"" or ""pursued"" not ""punish me.""  Does the title refer to Jan pursuing Elsa or about Jan's desires hounding him?  You decide.

All in all a great movie and I recommend it, if you can open yourself to its questions.",1251504000,10,4182,4.529960053262317
