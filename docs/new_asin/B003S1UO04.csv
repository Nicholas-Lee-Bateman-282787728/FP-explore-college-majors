4187571,5,B003S1UO04,I bought this Dinosaur Train DVD for a Christmas gift.  The child has enjoyed watching it over and over again.,1354492800,,110,4.5
4187572,5,B003S1UO04,My son absultly loves this dvd he watches it all the time. Dinasuares are one of his favorites. When I opened it to give it to him the expression his face was priceless,1315267200,2,168,4.121212121212121
4187573,5,B003S1UO04,"We have not watched Dinosaur Train before receiving this DVD, but my youngest loves dinosaurs and trains so we were super excited to review it! My son sat through the entire Dinosaur Train DVD only stopping to ask for a drink (LoL) which is almost a miracle in itself (he's very active). In the episodes, the characters search for the answers to the questions by hopping on the Dinosaur Train and going through the time tunnel to another period of time. It's really a cute little educational series that any preschooler would fall in love with. Dinosaur Train: Dinosaurs in the Snow also has an interactive game on the DVD called ""How Big"" which deals with spaces and counting. Also included are PDF files with coloring pages and an adorable song.",1308182400,,747,4.709923664122138
4187574,3,B003S1UO04,My children love Dinosaur Train. They were dissapointed there is no paleontologist explaining things and that each episode has the beginning song so it has become a little annoying to them.,1301443200,,189,5.129032258064516
4187575,5,B003S1UO04,Love this show as we do most shows on PBS.  Its educational and the kids love it! great combination!,1300492800,,100,4.2631578947368425
4187576,5,B003S1UO04,"With all of the television shows for children on today, none of them even compare to Dinosaur Train.  And the only thing better than an episode of Dinosaur Train on TV is an episode of Dinosaur Train on DVD.  My 4 1/2-year-old daughter can't get enough of this show, and my wife and I even enjoy watching it with her.  She also enjoys most of the other PBS Kids programming (ie: Sid the Science Kid, Word World, Super Why, etc.), but I find those mind-numbingly boring and amazingly irritating.  The same is certainly not true for Dinosaur Train.  It's entertaining, intelligent, and educational--once you get past the fact that they are time-traveling dinosaurs riding on a locomotive, of course.  We can't wait to share this show, and our love for dinosaurs, with our newborn son, once he gets old enough.",1297296000,,807,4.728571428571429
4187577,5,B003S1UO04,"My two boys love this show and were so excited to watch this DVD.  It contains eight 12 minute episodes, but not the Dr Scott segments included on PBS.  The boys don't seem to mind the missing Dr Scott, but I miss the short educational segments about each episode.  However watching my boys' faces light up when this DVD begins definately makes up for it.",1294444800,8,355,4.430769230769231
4187578,5,B003S1UO04,He loves this dvd... and asks to watch it over and over again. It's fun that I even will watch it with him.,1293321600,,107,3.6956521739130435
4187579,5,B003S1UO04,"I had to chuckle when the Dinosaurs in the Snow episode was on and my son said, ""Mommy, dinos have snow?""  It really came as a surprise to him.  It is no wonder that Dinosaur Train ranks in the top 5 children's programs among kids ages 2 to 5.  The show really captures the  imagination and inspires curiosity.
