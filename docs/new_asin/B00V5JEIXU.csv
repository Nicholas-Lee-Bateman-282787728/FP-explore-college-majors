7076763,3,B00V5JEIXU,"The movie itself was good. Not as great as I though it was going to be. The story is good and the acting is great (Sean Penn and Jude Law are superb) The minor roles are also acted well with the exception of Kate Winslet. I feel her performance was lazy and lifeless.

The bluray however was a huge dissapointment! No bonus features, behind the scenes, nothing. Not even subtitles! Its basically a VHS but in high definition.

I give the movie 3 stars but the bluray 1 star. Lame.",1442448000,,480,4.322222222222222

7076766,5,B00V5JEIXU,A terrific film grotesquely underrated by the critics I read.  Sean Penn is ( as usual) remarkable.  The earlier version of this novel deserves it's place as a classic but this one to my mind is a terrific new view.,1424131200,,215,4.35

8709324,5,B00V5JEIXU,"Sean Penn really did his homework on this movie. If you ever heard of Huey P. Long, you will recognize him in the character portrayed by penn - ""Willie Stark"". Good watch.",1525651200,,171,4.375

8709326,2,B00V5JEIXU,Missed most of what was said due to a poor sound track and southern accents. Subtitles would have been a huge help.,1484265600,,115,4.2727272727272725

8709328,2,B00V5JEIXU,"The novel was glorious but this film is overacted by Sean Penn and Jude Law cannot redeem it.  It is
an exaggerated tale of a demagogue like Trump, but even he has more subtlety.",1475539200,,178,4.235294117647059

8709331,5,B00V5JEIXU,This is a depiction of the time period with a true story. A very good look at politics of the time. I really enjoyed this film.,1468627200,,127,3.923076923076923
