345038,5,6301697308,"As one of the funniest movies to come out of the 1980's, ""Bachelor Party,"" still is funny today as it was back when it debuted. The story, which revolves around Rick (Hanks) and his impending marriage to  Debbie (Kitaen) involves so many hijinks that few comedies today can match  its' wit and hysterical output.
When Debbie's ex tries to convince Rick  not to marry her but fails, he then goes on the warpath to stop him by all  means necessary. But unaware to his knowledge, Rick and his wild and wacky  buddies create the biggest, best, and most hysterical bachelor party the  world has ever seen.
The film which also starred Adrian Zmed (Televison's  ""Dance Fever""; Broadway's ""Grease""), was a showcase of  Hank's comedic talents. Just seeing the way he strolls into most scenes  still makes me roll on the floor, because he does it with so much ease that  he looks like an authentic badboy. Unlike his roles in recent years, Hanks  was in his heydey when he made this film. I'm not sure how he will react  wheneve his career is saluted at a honorary banquet in the future, but I  hope he smiles and laughs that he has made millions of people laugh with  his role as Rick.
While this film was filmed years before the  politically-correct 1990's rolled in, the film's writers (including Neal  Israel, who wrote the first ""Police Academy"" movie) put out all  sort of gags. The opening scene at the store where Debbie works is  hysterical, and so is the scene at Chippendales where the women at Debbie's  bridal shower-gone-bad meet ""Nick the ----.""
Long before he  produced Madonna's ""Ray of Light,"" album, producer William Orbit  composed some of the electronica music heard at the bachelor party. The  great soundtrack (no longer produced) also featured Adrian Zmed, and some  songs performed by the all-girl group hired for the party.
If you are  look for a film that will make you laugh out loud, then this is it. Just  like in the tradition of other no-holds-barred comedies such as ""Scary  Movie,"" and ""The Naked Gun,"" this film will leave you short  of breath. Tom Hanks in his greatest comedic performance is a true classic.",964828800,8,2134,4.697297297297298
345039,5,6301697308,"Okay, maybe not.  But still the funniest movie I ever rented a dozen times when I was a teen.  A sweeping epic!  From the lesbians at the bridal shower (""Another one of these, eh?"") to the male strip bar  (""Wow!..And I was impressed when the world trade center  opened.""),  Why the heck isn't this on DVD yet? --- ""That the  foot long?"", ""...

345119,3,6301697308,"I saw ""Bachelor Party"" when it first came out in 1984 and thought it was hysterical. Then again I was much younger and probably saw it in an ""herbally-enhanced"" state of mind.

The film doesn't hold up too well after 33 years. It's silly, cartoonish, over-the-top, and somewhat funny in a juvenile R rated way. It's almost as if the producers got a bunch of  hormone ravaged 16 year old boys in a room and asked them what they thought was funny. That's not necessarilly a bad thing; you just need to appreciate it for what it is.

The only scene that still made me laugh out loud after all these years was the one where two hookers are misdirected to the bridal shower  to put on a show. THAT was worth the $7 I paid for the film.

Young Tom Hanks is young, and does his best with the material he was given. Most of the secondary stock characters are entirely forgetable except for Wendie Jo Sperber (friend of the bride ""Dr. Tina Gassko""), and Barbara Stuart (mother of the bride ""Mrs. Thompson""). They're funny! Tawny Kitaen (the bride) is pretty to look at in that big hair 1980's way and that's about it.

Overall, this isn't a bad way to kill a couple of hours and indulge in some 1980s nostalgia. Just don't go in expecting too much and you'll be fine.",1503705600,,1258,4.354700854700854

345348,4,6301697308,"Raunchy, easygoing frat boy entertainment that could only have come from the 1980s. Crammed with all the hallmarks of party films from that decade - glaring fashion choices, oodles of saxophone, frequent gratuitous nudity and tons of recreational drugs - it's wafer-thin and proud. The title pretty much tells you all you'll need to know about the plot, which frees up the rest of its running time to go nuts with blasphemous humor and increasingly inebriated acts of questionable legal standing. It's a perfect fit alongside the wild-eyed greats of its generation; Caddyshack, Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, make some room. Tom Hanks sometimes presses too hard to look crazy, unruly and cool, and often leaves us wondering how anyone could agree to marry such a slob (this may be the first time I've ever agreed with the pensive father-of-the-bride in this kind of movie), but when the music starts blaring he makes for a great master of ceremonies and that's really what the role called for.

345369,4,6301697308,"But, I really don't think that they applied any much effort in the remastering of this film for Blu-ray.  I have my share of grainy looking Blu-Ray discs, but they were much older than this one.

Perhaps this film was just a low budget effort at the time because for a film that had a lot of music, it was still only released in mono. Heck, not even two channel stereo. From 1984, that's pretty weak. Don't you think?

I've had the DVD for many years and I actually think that it still looks better than this Blu-ray.  Perhaps the DVD is a little muddier (having a slight, but expected, soft blurring, so to speak) and perhaps that made it look less grainy.

Anyway, we can not help but to want to constantly keep replacing our DVD's with Blu-ray's, but I'm gonna keep my DVD of Bachelor Party because on my smaller 32"" TV, it looks better than the Blu-ray does on my 60"" TV.

Rick's worried fiance, Debbie (Tawny Kitean), dresses up in disguise and crashes the party to spy on her future husband. To complicate the night further, Debbies father hires her ex-boyfriend to win back his daughter. It turns out to be an evening the soon-to-be bride and groom will never forget.

345449,5,6301697308,"I used to like golf. I still do but life has conspired against me and I have not played for years. Reading these reviews has been the equivalent of being on the first tee on a sunny day, settling over the ball, driver in hand and looking forward to a great round. My heart is filled with joy and remembrance of times past and I feel the world is a better place for seeing so many positive reviews of this film, when I thought I would be the only one to have liked it!

I have busted a gut laughing at the lines people have been quoting from the film, yes, I am 40 and have watched this film dozens of times, but it really is watchable, and I'm sure many of the reviewers are around my age and have as fond memories as I do of the film.

I was so glad to see one reviewer say that Hanks is still pleased with the film, so he should be. He delivers his lines with fun and style and I hoped he enjoyed making the film. There are so many lines, I love his attempt to cook for Debbie where he plops a bunch of raw potatoes in a bowl on the table, ""its potato salad, I hope you like it chunky style"" and later in bed, Debbie is awake telling him a list of things that are worrying her ""your family, may family, the dress, my shower, your bachelor party.."" Hanks replies, ""er, what about the Middle East, how are you with that?"" The film is well written and well acted, and although it moved predictably between a series of set pieces, they are done so well, you have to laugh. (The ""Nick the Dick"" scene is right up there with the Porkies ""tally-wacker ID parade scene"", and that is just one of the set pieces). Obviously Adrian Zhmed went on to be Officer Romano in TJ Hooker and Michael Dudikoffs name appears in B-Movies regularly, but all of the actors deliver humorous performances, and the overall effect is a high quality 80's ""Frat"" style film. Ladies, if you have a 40-something hubby, might I suggest a fine birthday gift would be a few friends, beer, nibbles and a 3 DVD night in with the lads featuring Bachelor Party, Porkies and Weird Science. Meanwhile, the ladies perhaps can watch St Elmos Fire, The Breakfast Club and Heathers in an adjoining room/house/town/state.

And Mr Hanks, if you are reading this, when you get your lifetime achievement Oscar, I hope you demand that they show a clip from this wonderful work to the Academy,",1228953600,6,2344,4.286681715575621

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.

No doubt this film helped him get roles in Splash and The Money Pit. Plot, simple, every soon to be groom has had a (stag party)...just not quite as crazy as these guys have. Schoolbus, donkey, drugs, strippers, tranvestites, stag films, horrible 80's music, and one big ass hotel suite. Without Mr. Hanks, this film would be nothing. He pulls it off with wit, quickness, and that goofy look, that only Tom can do. Alot of his lines were adlibbed by him. My favorite scenes, When he is cooking for his future bride and playing tennis as if it were baseball...funny stuff. Typical 80's fare without the rauchiness of Porkey's, Hot Dog, Spring Break, and all the others. Most notibably, can you even name anyone that went on to stardom from those films? Guess not. Bachelor Party is a riot of a time, rated R for nudity and some bad language, but definatley a B+ in the mix of all the 80's comedys.

The plot is weak, as is Tawny Kitaen's performance, but there are so many funny scenes and lines that it doesn't matter.  Tom Hanks is the only good guy in the movie.

But the chaos is acceptably choreographed up to the point when the donkey is brought into the party -- at that stage, I thought that the ""creative artists"" responsible for this had so lost their bearings that they would have been willing to explicitly depict bestiality on screen if they had thought that they could have gotten away with it.

Before Tom Hanks became a 'serious' actor he made great comedies. And before Tawny Kitaen went on doing Whitesnake videos and beating up her baseball husband she was a cute little knockout. Of course the hottest chick in the movie was a toss-up between 'Tracy' and the belly dancer who had a fetish for mules.

And hey there's stuff here for the ladies to enjoy too! You got ""Nick the Dick"" who serves foot longs as only he can. And what woman wouldn't go ga-ga over the male cast who are Tom's best friends. You got the little dude who tries to get hookers and ends up with a Marilyn Monroe-ish transsexual, the drug addict who tries to slice his wrists with an electric razor, the Animal House reject mechanic with enough body hair to fill a mattress, and the good doctor with the proctologist wife.

Yes folks if you haven't lived through the 80's you don't know what you missed. Life was just like this movie. Wild crazy sex, lots of partying, alcohol, and that lovable ""who cares about tomorrow?"" attitude.

The gags in this film were cool. Like the fist fight in the 3-D movie. That was great. The morphing heads on Tracy's body were to set the stage for thousands of movies later, and the two prostitutes showing up at the wedding shower was priceless. ""Do you have an open outlet?"" Oh God I miss the 80's.

So get the popcorn ready and snuggle up on the couch with your honey. They don't make movies like this anymore. They can't. The warmth and innocence of the 80's are long gone, but at least we still have the films. Enjoy 'Bachelor Party' today!",1103241600,,1774,4.412844036697248

345473,5,6301697308,"Back in 1984, before Tom Hanks became Mr. Oscar-Award, he made a little film called Bachelor Party, which to this day is one of the all-time funniest movies I have ever seen.
Tom stars as Rick Gassko (much in the same style that he played as Kip Wilson on his short-lived TV show, Bosum Buddies), a man who shocks his best friends by announcing his plans to marry his sweetheart, Debbie, played by Tawny Kitaen. His friends try to talk some sense into Rick, and are totally against the idea, but decide to send Rick off with a bachelor party for the ages!
The only thing in the way is Debbies' father, who absolutely hates Rick. The thought of him marrying his daughter is too much to bear. So, he enlists Debbies' jerk ex-boyfriend, Cole, to try to win Debbie back and get rid of Rick.
There are way too many funny moments in this movie to go into complete detail, but if you want to laugh, just get this movie.
There is something about early-to-mid 1980's comedies like these that you just don't see anymore.
On a personal aside, I don't know what it is about actors with a natural gift for slapstick and comedy (Jim Carrey is the latest example), that turn serious and only go after roles that are only potential Oscar winners. Tom Hanks has made some excellent movies since 1984, no doubt about that. But, it is this type of movie which personifies his gift of comedy which has been missed over the years.",1070323200,4,1409,4.444015444015444
345474,5,6301697308,"I love this film.......absolutely love it!  This was that glorious time in the 80s when R rated sex comedies were box office blockbusters.  This is when Tom ""I'm a really really serious actor now"" Hanks was funny;  I mean EXTREMELY funny.  This film has all the laughs of the sungenre, but it's also got something that it's peers don't, and that's(don't laugh) a good love story.  Maybe it didn't affect you this way, but I saw this as a very touching love story amongst all the silliness.  I saw this film as a true test of Hanks' love for his fiancee-just look at what he has to deal with:  1)His beer drinking, sex crazed buddies are against the idea and rather than support him, give him a bunch of flak(is that how it's spelled?).  2)  His fiancee's ex keeps trying to buy Hanks off with money and appliances.  3)  Hanks's future in-laws hate his guts and aren't afraid to let him know.  4)  He's surrounded by hookers and people having sex at his bachelor party.  Hanks brushes all of this off and in no way lets it hinder his decision to marry his fiancee.  There's even a scene where Hanks' ex girlfriend(played by the gorgeous Monique Gabrielle), takes off her clothes and tries to seduce him.  That takes a real man who must really be in love to walk out of that bedroom!  I think that's the best part of the film;  The fact that every one and every thing is trying to derail Ricks marriage, but he never gives in and gets his girl at the end of the film.  Very moving.  Plus there's hilarious scenes of juvenile sex humor if romance isn't your thing.  The combination of these two factors make this one of the best comedies I've ever seen.",1068681600,2,1650,4.397350993377484
345475,5,6301697308,"I have been a fan of Bachelor Party since first seeing it on HBO back in 1985.  I was hooked the first time I saw it, and have yet to outgrow it. Some critics pan the movie for being too dated because of the fashion and music of 1984.  Well, unless the movie is sci-fi, fantasy, or a western, it's probably not going to date well from any era. These critics could just-as-easily pan a film like Saturday Night Fever for the same reasons. Anyway,the laughs in Bachelor Party start before the opening credits roll, and don't stop until the end credits.  The dialogue is fast, memorable and quoteworthy, and the acting is very satisfying for what is essentially a 'raunchfest' of a comedy. The soundtrack is quirky (basically a collection of basement tapes from IRS Records), but the songs are fun and fit the party atmosphere of the film.  We even get to hear some great tracks by The Police, Oingo Boingo, and *good* Wang Chung.

The DVD transfer is excellent.  The picture has been restored beautifully, and the sound, while originally recorded in Dolby 4, is clear and in the center - basically as good as it could be restored. There are no deleted scenes, but there are a few promotional shorts that are fun to watch, dated as they are.  The original trailer gives you a good indication of how well the picture was restored for the DVD.

This is a highly recommended purchase, and if you're a big fan of the movie, make sure to visit the official Bachelor Party movie website (just Google ""bachelor party movie"").

Add this DVD to your collection, you won't regret it!",1068595200,4,1570,4.5587188612099645

  The plot is simple enough:  Man getting married, buddies throw him a bachelor party.  Throw in some stuck up in-laws, a ex-boyfriend trying to sabotage the wedding, a wiener on a bun, a roomfull of hookers and a dead donkey, and you've pretty much got all an 80's comedy could want.
  The only thing this movie does lack is a strong supporting cast.  Lead by Jay O'Neil (Adrian Zmed) ""I wish I had someone I could really respect.  Hey, Look at the cans on that bimbo."" and including the ""party animal,"" ""surfer dude,"" ""lovable loser,"" and ""doctor"" brother, the bachelor boys have their moments but no one truly stands out.  All this movie needed was an Al Czervik, or John Blutarsky to turn it into one of the top comedies of the decade.  Still, all in all it's a good laugh.

345477,4,6301697308,"Not quite as raunchy as a movie of this topic could've been, BACHELOR PARTY has equal parts 'raunch' and 'trash' as it does 'feel-good' laughs ... and that's largely due to the charm of its star, a young erstwhile Tom Hanks long before he was a media darling and an Oscar contender.
In as unlikely a scenario as has ever been filmed, Hanks -- a school bus driver -- has snagged a voluptuous heiress to be his winning bride, but not before Hanks' rowdy friends carry through on their plans to throw -- you guessed it -- a bachelor party, hence the name of the film.  Enter the obligatory hookers, horse jokes, and a nerdy ex-boyfriend, and the laughs begin.
Sure, it might be predictable, and, yes, it might be dated, but BACHELOR PARTY still has some classic yucks worthy of a cult film.  Definitely worth the view.",1038528000,5,815,4.5
345518,5,6301697308,"I have seen this film a dozen times and LOVED it! I thought that it was funny. I thought that this was a fun way to show what people may do at a bacholar party. Adrian Zmed was soooooooo cute in this movie! Whrnever his character would try to get Rick into bed with a woman, ""Rick"" stuck by the woman that he loved by not engaging in the sex and the drugs that was going on.
The scene with ""Cole"" hanging from the window was a riot! To some people it may be tasteless, but it is just in fun.... So pop some popcorn, grab your favorite drink, and just kick back and have one hell of a time! I am a girl and LOVE this film. You will not regret this film...

345520,3,6301697308,This is a light comedy where the cast got fun. Not a pretencious film made it just for entertainment. It is not a classic comedy but perhaps the main interest is to watch Tom Hanks as a beguiner in  the movie industry.,994896000,,218,4.190476190476191

345523,5,6301697308,"A true gem of early 80's offensive cinema, sprung from the same inspiration of other contemporaries like ""Porky's"" and ""The Last American Virgin"".
Forget ""Philadelphia"" or ""Cast Away"", if you want to see Tom Hanks at his finest, see this film.  From the opening scene where something harmless like a baby photo shoot is turned into a sexual gag about the mom, the film is unrepentant about it's crude gags and profane situations.  At the crux of it all is Tom Hanks, who applies his famous everyman personality to lend all the outrageous goings-on a lighthearted tone that softens the proceedings.  It is that quality that makes the film work so well, much like Ben Stiller's lovelorn and earnest character allowed the audience to actually care about ""There's Something About Mary"" beyond its own crudities.
Also adding the enjoyment of the film are the supporting cast, especially Adrien Zmed as the best friend and bachelor party ringmaster and Robert Prescott as Cole, the competitor for Hanks' bride, a warm-up for his hilarious role as Kent in ""Real Genius"".
All in all, if you are looking for a film with the shock humor of a ""Porky's"" and the lighthearted wit of an ""Animal House"", you can't do better than ""Bachelor Party"", certainly a Must for any fan of 80's cinema.",990057600,5,1276,4.8173515981735155
345524,5,6301697308,"If you are to own one Tom Hanks film, this should be the one!  Tom is a raw, cocky, comedic genius in this film, and is really at his pinnacle.  Every scene in this movie is a memorable one, and you will be able to quote it for years to come.  This film also marks the debut of Bruce Springsteen, who does a wonderful job as Rudy, the wacky mechanic.  All in all, this film is a great time from start to finish, ... !!!",989971200,5,419,3.8941176470588235
345525,5,6301697308,"Forget about Tom Hanks, the serious actor. I could care less about drivel like ""Philadelphia,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or ""Castaway."" Hanks' comedic knack has never reached the heights it did in ""Bachelor Party,"" far and away his best film. Surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including the delectable Tawny Kitaen, this film is like a runaway train, but one you don't want to get off. Often sophomoric (sophomoric is good), but never less than hilarious, ""Bachelor Party"" is probably one item Hanks would like to purge from his resume. Keep an eye out for the Indian pimp: he steals the show.",988070400,,598,4.930693069306931
345526,5,6301697308,"I think Tom Hanks is one of the best actors out there, but not because of Forrest Gump, Philadelphia or Saving Private Ryan.  Those are all amazing performances and amazing films, but not what I consider the magic of Tom Hanks.  In my opinion it is his comedic genious, and Bachelor Party is the best example.  It is histerical, right up there with Animal House.  Basically Tom Hanks is about to get married and his friends throw him a bachelor party the way every guy dreams his bachelor party will be. It doesn't start out that way though. Hanks and his gang overcome just about every obsticle in the cliche book.  His girlfriend's father hates him, her ex-boyfriend is trying to ruin the fun, old flames are coming out of the past, and no one is showing up for the party.  In the end everything works out, but not before an adult film gets wasted, a friend trys to kill himself, another friend hooks up with a transsexual, the bride to be crashes the party, her father crashes the party, her exboyfriend ends up hanging naked out a window, and the usual sex, drugs, hookers, kidnapping, police, and dead donkeys that go along with the territory of a mans last night of freedom.  A classic picture that captures the true essence of the American bachelor party. I laugh just thinking about it.",973036800,2,1294,4.551724137931035
345527,5,6301697308,"As one of the funniest movies to come out of the 1980's, ""Bachelor Party,"" still is funny today as it was back when it debuted. The story, which revolves around Rick (Hanks) and his impending marriage to  Debbie (Kitaen) involves so many hijinks that few comedies today can match  its' wit and hysterical output.
When Debbie's ex tries to convince Rick  not to marry her but fails, he then goes on the warpath to stop him by all  means necessary. But unaware to his knowledge, Rick and his wild and wacky  buddies create the biggest, best, and most hysterical bachelor party the  world has ever seen.
The film which also starred Adrian Zmed (Televison's  ""Dance Fever""; Broadway's ""Grease""), was a showcase of  Hank's comedic talents. Just seeing the way he strolls into most scenes  still makes me roll on the floor, because he does it with so much ease that  he looks like an authentic badboy. Unlike his roles in recent years, Hanks  was in his heydey when he made this film. I'm not sure how he will react  wheneve his career is saluted at a honorary banquet in the future, but I  hope he smiles and laughs that he has made millions of people laugh with  his role as Rick.
While this film was filmed years before the  politically-correct 1990's rolled in, the film's writers (including Neal  Israel, who wrote the first ""Police Academy"" movie) put out all  sort of gags. The opening scene at the store where Debbie works is  hysterical, and so is the scene at Chippendales where the women at Debbie's  bridal shower-gone-bad meet ""Nick the ----.""
Long before he  produced Madonna's ""Ray of Light,"" album, producer William Orbit  composed some of the electronica music heard at the bachelor party. The  great soundtrack (no longer produced) also featured Adrian Zmed, and some  songs performed by the all-girl group hired for the party.
If you are  look for a film that will make you laugh out loud, then this is it. Just  like in the tradition of other no-holds-barred comedies such as ""Scary  Movie,"" and ""The Naked Gun,"" this film will leave you short  of breath. Tom Hanks in his greatest comedic performance is a true classic.",964828800,2,2134,4.697297297297298

There are many silly movies from the 80s that I really enjoyed, but there wasn't enough here to keep me interested. Skipped through so much and found Tom Hanks' character extremely annoying.
