Honestly, the animation even on blu-ray is a little dated buuuuut, what it lacks is surface visuals, it makes up in an amazing story. You will be glued. The story of Akira is so amazing that, Im shocked that there isn't a terrible recreation that Hollywood hasn't come up with yet. Akira is a MUST see..

For those who rated it less than a four... I'm just letting you know those people don't have souls and you should ignore them.

622979,4,6303305520,"Apparently I'm older than most of the reviewers here; I got a copy of the original Streamline 1991 VHS version of this back in 1992 at Dallas Fantasy Fest.

This version looks every bit as good as it ever did. Gorgeous presentation.

For those of us in the west, though, the translation is where this goes south. The 1991 English dub was much, much better than it is now. And yes, I know it's been translated a number of times since; it's just that sometimes the first time you do something tends to be the best time.

I didn't spend much time on the subbed version but it looked largely the same as it ever did. I'm sure they've done that one ten times over as well.

At the end of the day, I'd really like to see a nice 1080p version of the 1991 Streamline classic. Not to say this one is bad...it's still watchable and still amazing...just not as watchable and amazing as it once was.",1515888000,,887,4.261904761904762

623024,3,6303305520,I picked this up since I remembered it as being super epic. Watching it now just made me see it for so many flaws. I wish there weren't so many plot holes. I get that it was cleaned up and it looks very well done compared to the VHS I remembered; dark and fuzzy. This version is sharp and bright. I really wished they would have been an extended cut. The other features on the disk were only on the making of and cleaning up of the film.,1515628800,,437,3.977272727272727
623025,5,6303305520,"I just watched this via Amazon Prime for the first time. I've heard sop much about how ""legendary"", ""inspiring"", and ""epic"" this anime is. Constantly hearing ""If you like anime you MUST WATCH THIS"". I usually avoid those types of things. Let the hype die down and what not. but this specific film doesn't have hype, it has accolades. It has awards, and to this day is STILL part of pop culture. It's like an Atari, a classic beatles album, NWA's Straight Out of Compton, no mater how old it gets it gets the same response and respect. Since I now have no reason to NOT see this film I decided to give it a shot. First, this is full on anime. This is what anime is. Only hting it doesn['t have is giant robots. So if you are a casual anime watcher who only watches simple things like pokemon or something, the early parts can probably get confusing and you'll loose intrest. I'll admit, I almost did, but the story has a good way of throwing stuff at you like you're supposed to know what's going on but keeping you interested enough to keep watching to figure it out. It doesn't hold your hand through the story, you're just as lost and out of the loop as the citizens witnessing the event unfold but it does get explained, somewhat. At no point was I bombarded with loads of dialog explaining what was happening and why, I got the basics and was left to come up with my own why. The climax is huge even though the build up is swift it last quite a while. I found myself texting people for the first 10 minutes while trying to grasp what was happening to being fully ingaged and ignoring all other things. The art is amazing, one of the highlights of the entire movie. Characters are enjoyable and though many aren't seen often you do get invested in wanting to know more. The sound is amazing, just as good as any big blockbuster action film. I normally don't go around saying ""you must see [insert movie]"" but this is now one of the five movies I feel everyone, especially anime fans,. must see. I will admit I'm no die hard anime fan, I only watched dubbed anime and am pretty picky about it but this film proved to me why it earned it reputation, and I have a greater respect for anime that follow in it's footsteps.",1515542400,2,2220,4.3261390887290165

623027,5,6303305520,"Akira is legendary. Any fan of anime (and animation in general) worth their salt knows this. Why? The scope and confluence of complex storylines, the exquisite detail, the graphic violence unknow to animation before its release, and the impact it has on the genre. One of my top 10 films of all time.

623076,2,6303305520,"This brief review is for the Blu-Ray version ""Akira"".

I'm writing this from the perspective a person who has seen just about every meaningful science fiction movie every made. I had not see this till now (November 25, 2017). I have never been a fan of Manga or Anime but having said that I have never really given it a chance either. So really this review would be for someone like me who has never seen this and is not a fan of the genre.

I'm not much into animated movies or in this case 'anime'. I know my opinion will be decidedly different than most people here. I expect no fans of the movie to agree with me so I'll keep it brief.

Knowing nothing of what this movie is about, only that it is famous, I popped in the Blu-Ray with zero expectations. I did not even read the back or the description. Sometimes I like to watch a movie having no idea what I am going to see.

On the positive side of things, I thought the animation was excellent for it's time. I always like the idea of a movie in a post-apocalytic future. But other than that I didn't like much else.

I found 'Akira' to be confusing and didn't make a whole lot of sense. If this is the sort of movie that you need to watch again to understand then it is not for me. I am not against watching movies multiple times...I do it often. I'm just not a fan of having to watch it again to pick everything up after you
watch it the first time. I'm not sure if that's the case here. I don't really know if I'd learn anything new. There are plenty of extra's. I had planned on watching them. But after watching this movie I have no desire to learn anything more. I'll give it a day or two before putting this one away for good.

In addition, I found parts of it dull. I'm not an action 'junkie' but I don't like watching stuff that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. We have the main scientist throughout the movie saying over and over again for two hours....'I can't believe it...this can't be...etc.....'. This doesn't tell me anything. By the time he says anything meaningful about the birth of a new universe, the movie is over. And then you get left with a very unsatisfying ending.

Yeah, I know it's groundbreaking....but groundbreaking doesn't mean good. 'Blade Runner' was groundbreaking in this genre too but it was a good
movie. Also in the genre, 'Neuromancer' by William Gibson, the novel of course was ground breaking but I was bored to tears with that and put it down half way through.

Yes I get the fact that 'I don't get it' but when a movie doesn't have enough things going for it that interest me I usually won't take the time to 'get it.' There is a lot of entertainment in the world to see or read these days.

Recommended for fans of Manga, Anime, cyberpunk and hard-core science fiction fans.",1511568000,3,2779,4.288167938931298
623077,5,6303305520,"Though it's a somewhat awkward compression of the manga, ""Akira"" works great on its own. The tale of two teenagers in Neo-Tokyo, it begins when biker Tetsuo is captured by government forces and separated from his childhood friend Kaneda. Strange powers awaken in Tetsuo... and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

The voice acting works well, the animation is superb, the characters likable, and the soundtrack is something new entirely. ""Akira""'s action sequences shine, but even the quiet moments are worth pausing to see the meticulous detailing of Neo-Tokyo. Complete with vistas of space-age skyscrapers and all the futuristic cars and motorcycles you could ask for, ""Akira"" is an animated gem. But before you go showing it to your kids, know that it's rated ""R"" for a reason. This is a good movie. But it is not a kids' movie.",1510963200,2,832,5.028985507246377
623078,5,6303305520,"As far as Anime goes you'd be hard pressed to find one to top this classic from the 80s; even watching this today it doesn't feel at all dated.  This sci-fi of a dystopian future has rightly spawned a cult following and this latest steelbook release is a real treat for fans and for those looking to upgrade from the standard definition dvd release.  I for one fall under the latter category and although I would have settled for just the blu ray we get also the dvds here.  The blu rays are definitely worth the upgrade and the picture and sound quality on them are a vast improvement.  The steelbook itself is a thing of beauty very well designed and comes with a 32-page colour booklet containing several excellent essays on the release as well as an interview with Otomo.  This film rewards repeated viewing and is one of the few that I tend to revisit at least annually.

This is an excellent release that will please fans and especially steelbook collectors.

It was also delivered at a timely fashion as well.

623410,4,6303305520,"Akira is, in many ways, a genre defining film. I have seen scenes from both the Manga and the movie scattered all over anime and even other genres of film. I would argue that the character of Eleven in ""Stranger Things"" shares a lot of characteristics with the psychically gifted children in Akira, including her abilities, name(convention anyway), tattoo and the nosebleed she gets after using her power; something that shows up in the graphic novels but not the movie.

I started reading the Akira graphic novels back in the mid eighties and, when the movie first came out, i was happy with how well they adapted it to the screen.  Re-watching it again nearly 20 years later, I was surprised how crisp it looks. A lot of movies and Anime don't age well. If anything, I thought Akira would not look out of place along side modern anime films. Very few of the details seem to date Akira like some other movies.

The one thing I would complain about and the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the end of the movie. Specifically the last 45 or so minutes. of it. The movie just seems to drag on and on with no end in sight. When you finally do get to the end, you sort of feel like you should have quit much sooner.  Today they probably would have spun this into two or even three movies or more. But, instead I get one movie with a fantastic beginning, good middle and a long, drawing out, boring end.",1486425600,2,1411,4.333333333333333

This CD is the only place I could find this version. The English dubbed voiceover is cartoonish and flat and really robs this film of it's austerity and maturity. I highly recommend watching it subtitled. Though, it is such a visually rich movie that it makes it difficult to really take in the art. I guess I'll just have to watch it several times ;)
But, if you are looking at this move here, you probably already know what it is, have seen it, and know that it is a movie worth having in your collection.",1486425600,4,644,4.512820512820513

HD 1080p looks amazing and the already amazing looking animation looks even better. The audio is great for both English and Japanese dubs here. If you prefer to watch things in dub because you don't like reading and watching at once, I recommend the pioneer dub over streamline because they fit the roles of the characters better and they actually pronounce things correctly but if reading subtitles isn't a chore for you, I'll say that the Japanese dub with English subtitles is the best way to experience this movie.

It's an enrapturing epic that takes place in Neo-Tokyo after an apocalyptic event connected to the one they call Akira. Its characters are all fleshed out, the animation, the backdrop, the theme all compliment each other in a way few films (live action or animated) can. This is the Japanese animated classic that captured the imagination of young American viewers nationwide. It planted the seed of the Anime and Manga culture in the states.

624237,5,6303305520,"There's just enough of an Eastern philosophical bent to make some things in this film a little stranger than necessary, and a couple of times the action seemed to indicate that the English language voiceover was not a proper translation of  the original Japanese. Also, the plot (despite lots of physical action) takes perhaps a tad longer than necessary to get to the core of the story... but that could also simply be Western vs. Eastern storytelling styles.

That said, ""Akira"" remains an amazing vision of a dystopian future. Sometimes bordering on the psychedelic and often quite bloody, the story is told with memorable characters and visuals that might just refuse to leave your head after viewing. (It is NOT, repeat NOT, a cartoon for kids; it's a dark, violent and occasionally disturbing story meant for the 18+ audience.) There are what seem to be some loose ends that never quite get tied up, and a few side stories & characters that are never developed beyond the bare minimum needed to move the main characters through their actions, but it holds up very well despite being nearly 30 years old. The main characters remain true to type, most with well-defined individual personalities, and even those that are more ""cardboard"" archetypes or simply there for comedic relief are all recognizable individuals in the crowd. I won't include any real spoilers here, but the story itself requires viewers to use inference and memory to fill in some blanks for themselves as would any decently-written book or script.

Keep in mind this is not a light-hearted cartoon romp through the future so much as a story about the corrupting effect of power and the destructive abilities of different forms of madness and/or pride -- and then sit back, watch it, think about it, and then watch it again.",1458345600,,1799,4.891803278688524

One of the main things that stood out for me when I saw Akira as a kid was that the anime has characters who look convincingly Japanese. I highly recommend Akira to those who think anime is just cutesy, big-eyed caucasian looking characters living in Japan. No offense to those animes, but Akira came out with something special, tackling very Japanese problems with a Japanese aesthetic. To this day, it's still my favorite anime and I haven't seen any other anime that has made me think on a deeper level about existence and real world problems. I highly recommend the movie. If you get a chance, also read the manga, which is six volumes and gives even more of a spotlight to the awesome female character Kei (my favorite character).",1452643200,,1013,5.029761904761905

Then the ending left me blown away, I had to watch it again and again and again. Each time im understanding more of the plot that i didn't pick up previously do to my being confused. However, this movie is wonderful in my opinion, but it might not be right for everyone. Its rated R, and even though the movie came out in 1988, the rating still stands, in my opinion. Furthermore, since its so ""old"" the lip syncing doesn't match up a lot of the time which could be distracting. Also, you have to be open minded to the art style. There are just a few quirks that bothered me before i became really involved in the movie ( such as how high up the mouths are on the faces ). I also write this review without having read the manga, which i hear is a lot better than the movie.

Saw it in the late 90s with the second English dub. Loved it. The art style is, by today's standards, very analogue. Hand draw cells. No CG. Large Bright colors throughout. Lots of violence. Some excellent voice acting and amazing scripting for its day. While today, thought provoking scripting is kinda the norm for anime, back then, most of it was He-Man styled fluff. THIS IS NOT HE-MAN STYLE FLUFF. It is very deep. It is thought provoking. It is simply amazing!

The old dub was a relic from my childhood, fading away on my VHS copy bootlegged from a Blockbuster rental.  I even ended up buying a Laserdisc player to get Akira in the English dub I remembered...

So here it is, in all it's corny glory!  Sounding better than ever!  Plus I get to brush up on my Japanese with the original sound!  There's also the new dub for people who can tolerate Kaneda being pronounced ""Canada"" and the crap new voice cast with no emotion (I feel nauseous just thinking about it.  Screw you, English Vash!), if that's your thing...

Plus, all the extras are here!  I love the score documentary :)

The PICTURE IS PHENOMENAL!  You can see the layers of cels and amazing detail.  It feels like the colorized Manga come to life!

  Save your money and buy anime with good stories with detailed characters. With better stories... Cowboy bebop, Berserk, Samurai X... those are stories and plots that are worth watcing.

  Overall I would say the film tries to focus on being strange and over the top that all the fine artistic detail is left to suffer.... it shows its age and the overblown plot made the move a yawn fest.

624800,5,6303305520,"Akira was a watershed moment for Anime in America. Until then most Americans associated Anime with cheaply made cartoons involving giant robots, flying battleships or teams of five fighting heroes. Then came Akira and Americans discovered that the Japanese were capable of producing high quality animated films without cutting corners. 27 years later Akira remains a visual treat with an unforgettable story.

Here is a confession. Although I think that Akira is an absolute must have for Anime fans I was never as big of a fan of it as I was other popular Anime. There is something extraordinarily disturbing about the film. It is most definitely not a film for young children and contains some extremely graphic violence and horrific imagery. When I was 18 this film really messed with my mind as there are moments that play out like a waking nightmare. Nowadays I appreciate the film a lot more but back in the day I would have preferred Castle in the Sky or Ninja Scroll, which also had violence but didn't mess with your head.

My other issue with Akira is some of the design issues. In most cases the designs are beautiful from the spectacular Neo-Tokyo to Kanedas gorgeous bike. The character bodies and movements are fluid and believable. My one issue is with the faces. Just as a Hiyao Miyazaki film has a very distinctive look so does Katsuhiro Otomo. The difference is I find Miyazakis faces very aesthetically pleasing whereas Otomos faces are often pinched up with narrow set eyes. It sort of adds to the creepiness of the film but in this case I think it was inadvertent.

So Ive criticized what I didn't love about the film but it remains a monumental achievement. Despite the main characters having some rather unpleasant characteristics Otomo still managed to make them highly sympathetic. The pacing is well done, the music is very distinctive, and the backgrounds are beautiful. The cyberpunk atmosphere is totally 80s but that gives the film a certain charm rather than making it feel dated. I first watched this film when I was 18 and found it remarkable but creepy. All these years later and I appreciate it a lot more.",1434326400,3,2141,4.796747967479675

Writer: Katsuhiro Otomo

In my nearly three years as The Peoples Critic, I have only reviewed two films that were not new releases. The first was for the film Nashville because I simply could not believe how much I liked it, and the second was Marie-Antoinette by request from my cousin after we had visited the Palace of Versailles in France. My lack of vintage reviews is by no means intentional, but there is only so much time, and reviews of current films seem to be the best way to gain and keep an audience of readers. However, I have recently started up a Movie Club for students at the high school where I teach as a way to use a shared interest to encourage social interaction. While the kids do pick the films, I do steer the club towards films I think will have an impact on them. However, when one of our members asked me if I would write up a review of the 1988 Japanese animated film Akira, I saw an opportunity for them to impact me. Now, I had never seen Akira and I must admit that the anime genre altogether has never been my kind of thing, but I decided to check Akira out, so Justin, this ones for you!

The film opens in 1988 when a nuclear explosion levels Tokyo and sets off World War III. 31 years later in the year 2019, World War III has ended and Tokyo, now known as Neo Tokyo, is a bleak, crime-ridden city home to numerous gangs including a bike gang led by a tough kid named Kaneda. After a night of debaucherous bike racing through the streets of Neo Tokyo, Kanedas close friend Tetsuo is put in the hospital where it is discovered that he has possible psychic abilities. Think a male version of Carrie.

Tetsuo becomes consumed with his new powers and quickly turns hostile, forcing Kaneda along with Colonel Shikishima to try to contain him before he lays waste to Neo Tokyo or even the world.

This is far from the most coherent narrative Ive ever seen. There are peculiar details that somehow must be taken for granted like the origin of these paranormal powers as well as the history of this trio of weird ghost children who are apparently previous test subjects experimented on by the government in the hopes of harnessing their psychic power. Cinematically, the film is a quintessential anime film. The action is unrelenting, the dubbing is bizarre, the violence is extreme, and the tone is unbalanced with humor and tragedy coexisting within sequences in abrupt ways. Many films of this genre possess these characteristics. For a 1988 film, the animation is remarkably fluid and the film has some real beauty, but what Akira has in style it lacks in substance. Gratuity aside, Akira is complicated and it attempts to tell a contained story with global, perhaps universal, implications that are never explored. Furthermore, the subtextual conflict between greedy political ambition, class warfare, and military hubris is too thinly executed to be successful satire. Still, Akira is tremendously imaginative. This film contains perhaps the trippiest hallucination scene Ive ever seen along with perhaps the most disgusting climactic event Ive ever seen, so the danger and scariness is occasionally pulse pounding. Additionally, the dystopian mood is nicely achieved through quality direction. Im not sure Akira did much in terms of encouraging me to pursue future anime films, but it did not turn me away from the genre entirely either.  C

Akira is rated R and has a running time of two hours and five minutes.",1431820800,8,3475,4.71499176276771

624925,5,6303305520,"Over the past decade, or so, I've owned half a dozen or so SD and BD editions of Akira. Skipping over all the former,

... in June of 2009 I bought the first US BD (""Bandi Entertainment"") edition, which was a major improvement over all the previous SD disks (e.g., the ""Genon Signature Series Edition"" SD);

...  in 2011 I bought the BD identified as the ""DTS Sound Edition"" from Amazon Japan as part of my test of Japanese BD picture quality versus that of other countries' releases... At the time I rated it very highly; the A-B Comparison w/the 2009 US Bandai Entertainment BD showed this one had a steadier image, w/more saturated colors and wider audio spread. It was like watching the movie for the first time...

In April of 2015 ordered the ""Akira FUNimation 25th Anniversary Edition/ DVD & Blu-ray Combo"" from Amazon, w/ASIN of B00ENNA62W, and UPC of 704400094187; its run time is 124 min. I don't believe it was available in this country until recently.

I didn't watch the SD disk. This 2013 FUNimation BD has the maximum amount of detail imaginable; it will challenge all BD players in terms of displaying all of its inherent picture quality. As well, the audio is phenomenal, far better than any previous SD or BD release.  I also have the impression that there are slight edits to the film itself that result in a more comprehensible flow of the story. In sum this is the last edition I intend to buy, until something of better (4K?) quality is marketed.",1429401600,4,1468,4.605363984674329

Now I know that anime had been around long before that since I was already collecting bootlegs on video tape in the early 70's. But once this film started to do the art house cicuit, college kids and those of us who were following the anime trend started to show up and enough box office money that  notoriety followed.
The film itself stands up very well and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in anime or even sci fi films. It is still the yard stick used to rate other films that are animated, adult, or sci fi orientated.

Now I will agree that the graphic novel (also by Katsuhiro Otomo) is better and expands the story and ideas in more ways, but the film was meant to be its own thing and it really exists in its own universe.

625033,4,6303305520,"Anime has never been something I felt drawn to, yet there are many titles  to which aficionados of the genre/style will always point you and which have achieved a sort of name recognition among those who wouldn't necessarily consider themselves fans. AKIRA is one of those films, and it happens to be the first anime film I've ever seen. The setting is 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, so named because of an apocalyptic event which took place 31 years earlier. The rebuilt city isn't too different from what you might find in a post-apocalyptic/dystopian sci-fi story. What stood out most to me, and the most recognizable elements of this type of story, was the portrayal of a fascist police state where government and those in authority abuse their power and the citizens fight against them. Not only do they show this violence, but there is also a lot of graffiti which provides subtext and context to the overall situation. Some of it went over my head because it's probably specific to Japanese society when this film (and the source graphic novel) were made, but the broad strokes of oppressive regimes, the military-industrial complex and populist uprisings should resonate with most viewers. All of this, and I haven't even gotten to what makes this story unique. At the center of this story is a biker gang, and one of the members, Tetsuo, is captured by a secret military group that studies people with psychic abilities. There is also another group of people who prophecy about the return of some mystical Akira, who will either bring balance or destruction. To be honest, I don't completely understand all of the plot intricacies, but most of the time I was being blown away by the stunning hand-drawn animation. I've never completely warmed up to computer animation, but animated films such as this one have an artistry to them that is second to none (when done right). One minor complaint I have is that the English dub (and I don't really like dubs) was a bit iffy in places. What I mean by that is some of the voice acting was a bit over-the-top. Still, it wasn't too distracting like it might be in a live-action film. My other minor complaint has to do with the length of the film. The third act was perhaps a little bit too protracted and it messed with the overall pacing. Still, I ended up liking this film a lot and look forward to delving into more anime in the future.",1425081600,2,2378,4.661904761904762

It then becomes a race against time to pull the plug on the madness created when a government dabbles in things angels fear to tamper with.

For it's age, the film feels a lot fresher than you'd expect. The characters are beautifully drawn with just the right amount of grit and grain, the background art is some of the best I've seen, the special effects are top notch for the time period, and the sound and English dub is actually done quite well! But the best is the unforgettable characters ranging from well thought out punk kids, to rabble rousing thugs all the way up to staunch government officials.

Oh, and did I mention lots of guns, blood, guts, violent explosions (some of which are seemingly pointless) and angry expressions? This film is an anime fans' wet dream!",1423526400,,986,4.628571428571429

After Akira, there was still pretty much the aforementioned. But there was also an onslaught of high-concept (sometimes artsy) animation. Animated movies, globally, started telling stories with abstract plots, historical events, and mature subjects like gore and sex. Akira itself shows a future, post-nuclear war Japan built into a mega-civilization. Tokyo is suffering political unrest, population increase, and an overreaching military that pushes into the metaphysical in order to fight an evil of its own creation. It's so post-9/11 but released in 1988!

625308,3,6303305520,"I feel like I'll get some flak for this review but it's primarily about the Blu-ray itself.  The movie is solid as usual, and slightly different presentation won't change much about how good it is.

I suppose you can only clean up old footage so much.  I was surprised static/dirt?/artifacts were in the backgrounds of a lot of scenes.  I'd say 2/3 of the scenes have backgrounds that simply aren't cleaned up or the age of the film wouldn't allow it.  Look no further than the bar scene at the beginning.  There are small white flecks that flicker on the screen around the characters.  This continues for, as I said, the majority of scenes.  There are also scenes that don't look touched up and are inconsistent with other scenes.  Sometimes the characters (usually the main ones) look great.  They are very vivid and the colors pop and look amazing.  Other times it looks like nothing was remastered save for a somewhat sharper picture.  I'm just very confused because most reviews I've seen hail this as having amazing picture quality.  I just don't see it, or rather I see it in certain places but not for the most part.

I'm no audiophile but the sound does seem to be as good as advertised.  I was really pleased with it and while I don't have any special sound set up I'm sure it would really come through if I did based on what I've heard.

The extras were above average in my opinion with plenty to absorb.  Even though it was just text I really enjoyed the glossary, which clarified more than a few things for me.  I was disappointed in the menus though only because I really liked the DVD ones.  As soon as the main menu pops up you hear the motorcycle engine rev and you're immediately sucked in.  These menus are virtually silent.  Just personal preference.

Overall I just don't know what others are seeing in the picture quality.  It's inconsistent at best, and distracting at worst.  The next time I watch Akira I don't know if I will watch this or go back to my old DVD.

Side note:  This may be just my copy but there were two or three points in the movie where the picture freezes for a split second when moving from shot to shot.  I'm not sure why this is.",1412640000,,2176,4.415617128463476

Certainly, the main feature will show you many unseen scenes of Yoshizawa; but it doesn't go deeper in anything, neither in his life or in his technique.

There are some relevant facts, like Yoshizawa and Gherson Lengman or the worldwide exhibitions. My favorite part is in the end where he is folding swan out of a equilateral triangle.

The video it's O.K., the audio is in japanese (also the menu) and has only english subtitles; I think that the subtitles has some translating issues/mistakes. This is a remastered version from the original. Originally this was commercialized in 1997 in VHS format without subtitles and without the 10 mins portfolio.

Let's compare the latest Dragonball Z Bluebox releases; cropped, yes.  But a lot of attention was paid to the colors and cleaning up of scenes, and it looks fantastic, and sounds fantastic no matter what audio track you're running.  It's a solid release.

I watched the special features of this release and couldn't believe what I was hearing from the studio that was tasked with the ""clean-up"" of the video source, or more to the point that much clean-up had happened at all.  It looks dirty.  There's artifacting.  It's not what I would expect from a 25th Anniversary Re-release.  It was distracting me from enjoying an otherwise fantastic film.

I actually bought this for the original dub included (with the VA of Leonardo from TMNT, or Ryudo from Grandia 2 voicing Kaneda) and was horrified at the quality of the audio.  It sounds terrible.  The ""new"" dub and the original Japanese audio track all sound fine, but it almost sounds like they degraded the original dub to make room for everything else on this disc, which should definitely not have happened.

Overall, it's still very watchable.  It's just incredibly... underwhelming.  Pick it up at a low price and you won't be too offended; I got it for $15.  It's okay for $15.",1403222400,,1447,4.746987951807229

625652,1,6303305520,"I am surprised that this anime has such high rating. Even more surprised that among 1-star reviews here over 90% criticise only the English translations and very few reviewers offer a genuine criticism of the anime itself! One customer put it very straight: what so many people seem to label as ""mysterious"" and ""thought provoking"" in this movie is in fact the absence of any plot, any idea, the movie shows just the violence and ugliness of characters and the scenery. Not a single likeable character. Another reviewer noted that many questions arise while watching this movie that seem to be important to understand the story are just left completely unanswered: Why do the strange children look so old and green, and why do they attack Tetsuo, and why do they attack him with teddy bears bleeding milk from their eye sockets? Why was the government willing to pour money into a super-secret super-kid project? What was the objective? If Akira is the power which supports everything (as one girl says in the movie), why does its manifestation look like a nuclear explosion? And why does it destroy the city then?

I watched it till the end as I was highly recommended to see it, and so I was hoping for some wonderful explanation at least in the final, after all this meaningless violence and scenes of ugliness, but there was none. Please forgive me by saying it but who liked this movie have a plain bad, or at least undeveloped, taste. The picture quality and the anime-drawing talent here are simply fantastic, but watching this trashy story and listening to the stupid dialogues (sorry for the language) for 2 hours did not do any good neither for my mood, nor for my soul.

P.S. There are wonderful japanese anime (most of Gibiri studio's for instance) with interesting, multi-dimentional characters and interesting plots, and side by side, with the same popularity, are ""Akira"", ""Evangelions"", ""Ghosts in a shell"" etc. But overall, en masse, people just seem not to be able to distinguish between the genuine art and complete distastefulness! Same average ratings, same popularity.",1395187200,3,2090,4.901129943502825
625653,5,6303305520,"I saw this movie with my dad and sister when I was a kid and enjoyed it than but was not sure what was going on, and I was a bit disturbed by the images, but still liked it.  Watched it recently and enjoyed the story and everything else.  But guessing you knew this since I gave it 5 stars",1395100800,,289,3.8
625654,5,6303305520,"The number 1 selling point as to why I bought this Blu Ray is simply because they allow you to choose between the 2 original English dubs. I LOVED the original voice acting, then they redid it with new voice actors and I thought it sounded pretty terrible. Normally I'd just watch Japanese movies with the Japanese dub, but the original English dub was so awesome that I actually always think back on it when I think of this movie.

This is one of those films that's so good that even people who don't really watch anime can really appreciate it. I personally am not a fan of anime usually, but even I can appreciate how awesome Akira is. From the really wicked futuristic motorcycle, to the great characters and awesome story, this movies got everything.

I'd say if you have yet to watch this film check it out, Akira is that one movie that everyone saw when it came out, even people who have no interest in anime, and a lot of them really loved it.",1394928000,2,951,4.367231638418079

625658,4,6303305520,"So, I heard a lot about this movie. Left and right I heard that the animation in the movie was amazing and boldly claiming that this movie defined the anime genre. So naturally, I thought it was a no-brainer to own this movie and was pretty excited to know what all the fuss was about.

Now, after watching the movie, I felt lost and confused as to what was going on with the characters, the story and the point to the whole thing. The animation was as people said it was, it was disturbing, yet fascinating. It almost made my stomach turn. What keeps me invested in a movie is a good story, however, the plot was all over the place. You'd probably still be wondering, who exactly Akira was, why his friends looked like wrinkled blue smurfs, what made Tetsuo so powerful and the ending that makes you wonder what purpose do these characters have to go on living after experiencing all that.

When I did some research to try to make sense of the plot I found out that this movie was based on the manga of the same name. The manga series was over 2000 pages long! Wow. Now things were starting to make sense. If I had read the manga I probably would've disliked this movie for the lack of detail and importance plot elements that could have help the audience understand why the characters acted the way they did and even provided a more detailed backstory regarding Akira.

However, after I read up on the small details, I was able to appreciate the movie a little more, but as movie I could recommend to my friends...well, no. I would tell them to just read the books. The movie tries to condense 2000 pages of build-up and development into a 2-hour movie. I am interested in the story and I may end up buying the books, but before I would want to make sure that it would be well worth it.

UPDATE: So I ended up buying the 25th anniversary edition and to my surprise it had a glossary with info on the world of Akira. As I stated above, I was so lost with the story that I didn't know what to make of it. After reading through the info in the glossary, I was able to understand the events the movie and even admire the film more for what it was. If you want to watch Akira, get this edition, if you don't know what is going on, the glossary will clear things up.

Enjoy!",1394323200,,2270,4.25754060324826

I thought it was about some dude named Akira and his motorcycle. But instead it's a thought provoking, brain-melting LSD trip of a film, that hits you with the feels and then makes you say ""WTF?"" in the same minute. Reminds me of Paprika, but of course way before its time. The visuals are spectacular, the story is engaging and the animation is a treasure to behold.

625686,4,6303305520,"My first viewing of this film was back in the early 90s, and it was a tenth generation VHS copy, passed from fan to fan via pen pals, the way we got anime way back when. I remember that copy was so full of sync loss and color bleed that it gave me a headache.
Seeing AKIRA on Blu-ray for the first time on my 12 foot projection screen was like experiencing the world of AKIRA for the very first time. The quality of image transfer to digital master was amazing for the age of the film. An excellent job of cleaning up, degraining each frame, was done.
The audio seemed quite good for a film of this era, too.
About the film itself, the animation work was groundbreaking for it's era, and it holds up well against many of today's anime in that respect. Lip sync was one of the unique breakthroughs in this film (I learned about this twenty years ago in a documentary called ""Akira Production Report"". They recorded dialog first, and let the actors act naturally, then adjusted the animation via the Quick Action Recorder to match the speech with precision.
AKIRA depicts a distopian world, one I would not want to live in. But Since this is a 25 year anniversary edition, and a classic, I wanted to own a high quality copy. Every anime fan should own this.
I expected there to be more bonus material on this disc and was slightly disappointed that ""Akira Production Report"" was not on the bonus material section. It was an excellent overview of how the film was made.",1393459200,,1466,4.413284132841328

The animation in this is also some of the best I've ever seen.  To be fair, if you're reading this, I'm sure you've already seen this movie to be interested in buying the blu ray, so I don't have to attest to the quality of the film.

I can't say anything about the English dub as I mainly watch anime with the original Japanese soundtrack, even though I don't know a single word of Japanese.  The English subs are excellent, but I am considering watching Akira again with the English dub, as I may be missing out on the effort and quality of the English voice actors.

Anyway, I purchased this DVD edition a few years ago and I suppose it is sort of obsolete now, since there is the new Blu ray/DVD edition.  So purchase the Blu ray and continue to enjoy and support this anime classic!

625797,1,6303305520,"Please do not waste your money on this again!!! I do hope Funimation goes out of business for Hacking out rehashed copies!

If you are truly a fan of Akira, then you already have the multiple versions of this on Laserdisc and VHS as well as the Various versions of DVD.

I was excited to wait for the 25th anniversary version to get this on Blu-Ray. The first thing I did (Big Mistake) was to watch the special on the restoration of Akira......They touted how they go through and clean up all the little specks throughout the film? As a Key Clean-up Animator...I was thinking great! This is going to look amazing...Like new!!!? Instead I sat through my favorite film feeling like my dog kept wiping himself on the screen in between some really clean scenes?

So when I start watching the Blu-Ray....All I notice is all the specks that they didn't clean up! So the first thing that ran through my mind was that this film has only had about 25% of it restored !!! Which thinking back was the same way I felt when I watched the last DVD. Starting on just the opening scene, you notice all the little specs in any scene that is dark and every consecutive ones that have massive elements you notice all the dirt that was to much to clean up? Then on certain scenes you get that familiar speckling on many BR transfers.

This Blu-Ray is nothing more than an exact copy of the Pioneer DVD release! there has been no changes or improvements... SO YES...I am thoroughly Disappointed! If you already have the steel book version then you can get the same experience with a player that has up-conversion on a 1080 TV...

Good thing I have held on to my Criterion laserdisc, since that is actually a cleaner copy than any of these so called restored versions! I actually believe that the Japanese Laserdisc is the best copy since it was digitally recorded the year after Akira's release, only missing the 5.1 remix. If these guys could just take that copy, stick it in an Avid and upmix the audio, then you will have the best copy.

So if you have the previous DVD's or any other copies already, then save yourself the frustration of watching this and wondering what the difference was!",1388966400,6,2173,4.50253807106599

625859,5,6303305520,"I want to start out this review by saying that I only previously owned the single-disc Pioneer DVD release, which was very bare-bones with special features.  (In addition to an old copy of the Streamline dubbed edition on VHS)  So I won't be able to accurately compare it to the other DVD and Blu-Ray releases that have come out.

That being said, this is a wonderful Blu-Ray release for the 25th Anniversary, boasting some fantastic picture-quality, great audio, and an admirable selection of Special Features.

To get things started, I do have to comment that Amazon's product description is inaccurate, as this release contains three discs, not two.  Two DVD Discs (one with the film, the other with special features) and one Blu-Ray disc (with both the film and special features.)  This was actually a treat, as based on Amazon's description, I had assumed it would only have a Blu-Ray disc featuring the film and features, with a bonus ""Bare Bones"" DVD containing just the film.  So it was a very pleasant surprise to open the package up and discover a bonus DVD that also included the Bonus Content.  (I know DVD is antiquated, but I prefer combo packs like this, as I don't have a Blu-Ray player in every room of my house.  Particularly the bedrooms, which still only have DVD players.)

The Blu-Ray picture quality is great.  Compared to the 2001 DVD I used to own, the colors are much more lush, the image has more of a sharpness and crispness, and everything feels cleaner and truer to the intended look of the film.  And while it may not be the biggest upgrade from DVD to Blu-Ray I've ever seen, it is still a noticeable upgrade, and one well worth making for fans who don't already own the film on Blu-Ray.

The special features are quite nice.  There are some nifty behind-the-scenes footage on the restoration of the film (mainly seeming to pertain to the 2001 re-dub and whatnot), some good interviews, a fair amount of original promotional materials and trailers, etc.  I've heard that prior releases included a 30-minute making-of from Japan, but that is tragically absent from this edition.  However, it's not a deal breaker at all, since the features present (along with the upgraded quality) are still definitely worth it.

And perhaps my favorite feature of this release in the inclusion of not only the Japanese language track and 2001 Pioneer English dub, but also the original 1988 Streamline English dub, which I haven't heard in YEARS, since I first saw the film on VHS well over a decade ago.  That is the treat of this release for me- the fact it includes both dubs.  (Both of which I adore, although I prefer the 2001 Pioneer dub overall.  But it's still nostalgic fun to listen to the old '88 dub, which was how I first experienced the film.)

All in all, I think this is a fantastic new release of the film.  Sure, it may be missing a feature of two, but it still has a nice selection of features, plus the exciting inclusion of both English dubs.  So for me, this is most definitely well worth buying for fans!",1387929600,,3043,4.646728971962617

625863,3,6303305520,"I saw this film during it's international debut way back when, and thought it was one of the more ""out there"" anime features I had ever seen.

The basic story regards some Japanese cycle street gang toughs who get caught up in some experimentation.

The basic psychological story regards a young man whose depression extends to the physical world, and the authorities try to keep a lid on his severe abilities by keeping him happy as they run tests on him.  He eventually becomes too powerful to control, and only Akira can bring things to an end.

The animation is is up there and close to classic Disney standards, but is obviously more violent than any child's fare.

It's not a film I have in my collection because to me it really borders on horror, a genre I'm not really big on.  But, there's lots of action in it, lots of mental-psychology mind stuff going on there, so if you're into the more bizzare films that revolve around abnormal psychology, then this film might be for you.

Personally, I enjoyed it for what it was (is), but it gets a little over the top towards the end, as is typical with a lot of Japanese animation.  If you're an avid anime fan, then you probably already know about this film.  If you're just a passing fan or just getting into anime, then I'd recommend renting the film once before making a purchase.

625928,4,6303305520,"Since Amazon condenses the reviews of multiple formats into one pile, I hope this one stands out.  It covers the new 25th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD combo pack from Funimation, NOT Bandai'a 2009 Blu-ray or one of the many earlier DVD releases.  I was able to get an advance copy from Funimation and also used it to write a separate full-length review of this title, listed below.

""Akira"" still holds up perfectly well after 25 years.  The film condenses a LOT of material into two hours; not surprising, since writer/director Katsuhiro Otomo's long-running manga series was still being written after its 1988 release.  This epic, violent, mind-melting slice of animated history is chock full of terrific visuals, an amazing soundtrack and, of course, the sci-fi tinged story that introduced many to Kaneda, Tetsuo and company.  Those new to the film will find it an exhausting experience, but don't give up: the eye candy will suck you in, but there's a real heart and soul to the story that has made countless fans worldwide return to ""Akira"" again and again.  It's practically the grandfather of modern anime.

But that's not what most people want to know; they're probably just curious how this Blu-ray stacks up to previous releases (pretty well, as it turns out).  Video quality is ever-so-slightly better than Bandai's 2009 Blu-ray: the image is no longer ""picture-boxed"" (thin black bars on all four sides) and the colors appear more well-defined and evenly saturated.  It's the same 2001 master, so don't expect a night-and-day difference...but it's there.  On the audio front, we get two excellent DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio versions of the original Japanese track and the 2001 Pioneer English dub, as well as a new DTS-HD 2.0 Master Audio version of the older 1998 Streamline English dub.  The choice of both English dubs is a nice touch, as I'd imagine that many long-time fans (including myself) have a nostalgic connection to the older one.  English subtitles are included for translation purposes only.  No dubtitles!

The bonus features, by and large, are similar to Pioneer's 2001 Special Edition DVD...which itself borrowed plenty of extras from the company's older Laserdisc release.  Two are missing, however: the excellent ""Akira Production Report"" (a vintage behind-the-scenes documentary) and a gallery of promotional images.  Otherwise, it's pretty much business as usual, but die-hard fans might still want to hold on to those Special Edition DVDs.

So essentially, we get a slight visual upgrade, the addition of Streamline's 1988 English dub and many (but not all) of the vintage extras not included on  Bandai's 2009 Blu-ray.  Funimation's 25th Anniversary Edition is definitely worth a purchase if you don't own ""Akira"" on Blu-ray yet, but those that do might not want to bother.

625929,4,6303305520,"Set in the year 2019, dystopian city of Neo Tokyo - 31 years after the catastrophic disaster that wiped out the entire city - Katsuhiro Ohtomo's seminal film ""Akira"" follows the story of a bousouzoku (""violent running tribe"") gang of bikers, including easygoing Shotaro Kaneda and timid Tetsuo Shima. Tetsuo, when severely injured, becomes a guinea pig for a government experiment, developing powers that no one can control.

Like Masamune Shirow, Ohtomo's forte as artist does not lie in storytelling, which gets more and more confusing and disjointed as the film's story goes on. Also, some elements are dated in ""Akira,"" such as character designs that definitely look 1980-ish. The traditional hand-drawn style of animation may look too old-fashioned to those who are accustomed to watching CG animation.

What makes ""Akira"" special is its technical aspects like stylish visual designs with meticulously drawn details, as well as sound effects that uses taiko (Japanese drum) sound effectively. There is a good reason that the name of Katsuhiro Otomo is (and probably will be) associated with ""Akira,"" even though he has created many works as an illustrator /manga artist and film director. You may not lie the film's violence (echoes of ""Robocop"" and ""Scanners""), but you will be impressed with the visuals.

It is pretty interesting and even amusing to hear the voices of enthusiastic anime fans living outside Japan, especially when the way they receive a certain work is considerably different from that of Japanese fans. This is the case with Ohtomo's ""Akira,"" one of the most influential animation films ever made, to be sure, but is this the greatest animation all the time?

A warning to those who have never seen this film. As you watch this, bear in mind that this was produced quite a few years before the advent of computer rendered graphics in films. This, to us fans, is perhaps the single most attractive aspect of this work of art. Every single frame in this movie was hand drawn.

625975,5,6303305520,"I remember the first time I watched this movie; I was hanging out with my best friend at his house and he popped this into the VCR. His copy of the movie had already degraded to a noticeable point where everything had darkened and turned soft. Within five minutes of the movie starting there was no darkness, only bright vivid violence and sharp dreamlike scenes that spoke to me even at a young age. After the film ended I borrowed the cassette from my friend and proceeded to degrade the film even more. I watched it over and over again. It was easy to get lost in the world Otomo had created and then put so expertly to film. I purchased my own DVD copy of Akira when I was in high school but something was off. It took me a few minutes but then I realized it was the voices. They had changes the English dubbed voices. They weren't bad but they weren't what I grew up with. I still watched it a few times on DVD but it wasn't the same. When I eventually moved in with that same best friend at college I wasn't even mad that he borrowed my DVD set and left them sensitive side up in his room and then fleas from a cat he had brought into our house had fleas and they left nasty blotches all over my discs making them useless. Time passed and I complained from time to time about the voice change when the movie came up but I figures it was just the way things would alway be.

I bought the special edition DVD and every volume of the manga (6 in total) . I don't regret it one bit.

The character development, plot, animation, and action are what really make this an amazing movie. Despite being over 20 years old the animation competes with today's standards. As for the character development, you couldn't possibly develop a character in 2 hours more than what was done with Tetsuo. By the end you both hate him and feel somewhat sorry for him. While both the character development and tiny details of the plot are better portrayed in the manga, the film does a fantastic job of compressing 6 volumes into a 2 hour movie.

626017,5,6303305520,"Neo-Tokyo 2019: Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang. His best friend, Tetsuo, gets injured during a fight with another biker gang, the Clowns. Kaneda and his gang get interrogated, while Tetsuo is medically examined. Colonel Shikishima and Doctor Onishi discover Tetsuo's incredibly dangerous psychic capabilities. Tetsuo, tired of being treated like child and always being saved by Kaneda, goes on a rampage across the city and Kaneda attempts to stop him from releasing Akira - the young psychic that destroyed Tokyo 31 years prior. Akira is a magnificent film from beginning to end; epic is an understatement for this captivating anime.

The story in this film is fantastic. Yes, some aspects of the film are predictable, but it is still an insanely captivating story - I was hooked from beginning to end. The conflict within Tetsuo is particularly amazing to watch, especially as he changes; changes you can see his frustration from the beginning, and you can see how power-hungry he becomes when he realizes his power. The ending of the film is amazing and even thought-provoking to a point. If you're looking for action, this film is loaded with great action sequences, especially the second half of the film. The futuristic Tokyo setting is mesmerizing, and works well with the story. Although I prefer the Japanese, I found the English dub to be more than tolerable. The music is one of my favorite aspects of the film; it is so epic, so well-fitted and a soundtrack I can listen to without the movie.

I own the Blu-ray of this film, which seems to be out-of-production now. It features both the Japanese and English audio, as well subtitles. The picture quality is superb, and the audio quality is great. (the visual style alone is beautiful.) If you can find a copy of this blu-ray, I highly recommend it.

Overall, Akira is a superb anime; it is an action-packed, visually beautiful and epic film with a magnificent finale, while also being subtly thought-provoking. It is pure entertainment of the highest caliber. A must-own for fans of the genre, and fans of film in general.

My first viewing of ""AKIRA"" was back in 1993. I have to be truthful, it was one of those films that I had to watch several times because I felt I was missing something integral. Each time I watched the film, there was always something new that I picked up and for anyone who has seen this animated film, just how much was put into the animation, the detail for an animated film.

In 1988, Disney had ""Oliver & Friends"" and being touted as the first animation to utilize hand drawn art and computerized graphics and as the film incorporated some darkness that may scare the kiddies, in Japan, ""AKIRA"" was a film that would set records in the Summer and eventually get a limited release in theaters.

The film would surprise and shock people because this was not a children's animation, this was geared for adults. And did it look awesome at that time!",1353024000,,949,4.570588235294117

That is what is so great about the GENEON-Pioneer 2001 issue of Akira. It's digitally remastered. It has 5.1 Dolby English audio. It has anamorphic widescreen. It has THX omptimizer and has a neat ""capsule Option"" that translates that Japanese graffiti.

626196,5,6303305520,"Akira is what they call a movie experience. An early-80s anime based off the manga comic of the same name, it is one of the earliest forms of the so-called cyberpunk genre. Akira was the movie that put Japanese animation on the map, and for good reason. Even today, thirty years on, it is still a masterpiece in animated entertainment, and proves once and for all that animation can be one of the most powerful mediums around.

The story of Akira starts out straightforward enough but escalates slowly but steadily into very, very deep and existential themes. In the city of Neo-Tokyo, thirty years after World War III, friends Kaneda and Tetsuo live on the streets and get their kicks out of hanging with their biker gang and fighting with their rival gang, the Clowns. Kaneda and Tetsuo have known each other since they were little, but things change when Tetsuo comes into contact with a mysterious, deformed child and is whisked away by the military. As Kaneda tries to keep a track of Tetsuo, Tetsuo begins to harbour enormous, terrifying powers that could not only destroy him but might trigger a chain reaction that will change everything, permanently.

The characterization in Akira is wonderful. Kaneda is a fierce friend who finds himself unable to protect his friend when he needs it the most, and then on top of that gets tangled with a resistance movement bent on exposing the government's secret ""Akira"" project, around which the whole story centers. Tetsuo's bitterness and low self-esteem are dangerous when met with the powers he is cursed with. One of my favourite characters is the Colonel, who you think at the start is going to be a villain but is a very three-dimensional, conflicted but ultimately righteous soul whom you come to root for.

The animation quality in Akira is second to none. Remember that this was the early 80s, when CGI was practically unheard of; everything is done on paper. With that in mind, the attention to detail prevalent throughout the entire film is dumbfounding. Neo-Tokyo is as sad as it is beautiful. The character animation is utterly amazing, especially towards the end of the movie, where things are animated that I (an animation student) wouldn't dream.

The way the film sounds is also a strong, characteristic aspect. Akira uses sound in a very clever way, particularly with the use of silence; absolute, stone-deaf silence. Silence is used to make the powerful feel powerful instead of getting in its way. Finally, and I was not expecting this at all, the English dub is wonderful! Normally, English as a secondary language for a film fails miserably, but this is not the case with Akira. All the dialogue sounds natural and appropriate and stays faithful to the Japanese dialogue.

Akira is a thrilling, often disturbing movie that is an experience to take in. Clocking in at two hours, it may require a couple of viewings in order to be fully understood. The climax of the movie demands the viewer to keep up, and comes a long way from the techno-centered, dystopian beginning of the movie. Safe to say, Akira is one of the most important animated films ever made, and still one of the cleverest, most powerful pieces of entertainment there is.",1348790400,,3207,4.834244080145719

I re-bought the movie on Blu Ray to watch it in 1080p, even though I already own the DvD version of the film. I consider this film to be the best introduction to anime for someone who is just getting their feet wet.

The quality of the Blu Ray is very good and I also enjoy the digital remastering. I understand for some this might be too much of a change so you might consider buying one of the older versions of the film. For me this is the definitive version of the movie and I really hope anyone who has not yet watched this film will give it a chance. Thank you for your time and enjoy the movie.

626306,5,6303305520,"I first heard rumblings about this film in 1990 and, not being a fan of anime, didn't pay too much attention. Just out of curiosity, I rented a copy on VHS at my local Blockbuster later that year. Now, bear in mind that my only exposure to Japanese anime was through shows such as Star Blazers and Battle Of The Planets (Space Batttleship: Yamato and Science Ninja Team Gatchaman in the original Japanese)in my youth. I loved those shows.

So, I popped this obscure little cartoon into the VCR for the first time in 1990 and was dumbfounded. I was awestruck by the visuals and the painstaking attention to detail in every frame. Being a fan of Blade Runner, I couldn't help but note similarities between the world Ridley Scott created six or seven years earlier, and this mind boggling Neo Tokyo that Otomo had created. Granted...it didn't seem to rain as much in Neo Tokyo as it does in the Los Angeles of 2019. This is where the similarities end....

This is a film about the consequences when trying to harness powers that are truly beyond human comprehension. It is the story of a group of troubled teen bikers who, in the midst of civil unrest, stumble upon a military conspiracy that could conceivably alter the course of human evolution and consciousness. Years earlier, a young boy named Akira manifested tremendous psionic energy. When science tried to experiment with such god-like powers, it destroyed the Tokyo of old. Now, housed in a secret containment base beneath an Olympic stadium, Akira lies in wait...as religious fanatics await his messianic reawakening.

In the meantime, a young misfit biker named Tetsuo has a chance encounter with a young boy who had been kidnapped by anti-military activists. Causing him to wreck his bike into a ball of flames, it is discovered that the boy Tetsuo encountered is part of yet another clandestine military/scientific operation in an attempt to delve deeper into the mysterious power of Akira...and to harness it. Tetsuo is taken into custody at the scene, much to the chagrin of his best friend Kaneda and the other members of their little gang.

It isn't much later that Tetsuo himself begins to manifest unspeakable powers that are beyond what the military had expected, nor were they prepared for.

This is just a part of a complex and yet INCREDIBLY well written story. Having not read the manga, but understanding there are volumes, I can only imagine how difficult it had to be to condense such a broad spanning plot...but it does succeed in giving the viewer something new to look at with each viewing. Again, my review is likely oversimplifying the overall scope of the story...but you can get the gist.

Like Blade Runner, it is a film where the look and overall aesthetic is merely icing on the cake. The cake is the deeply thought provoking material and it's underlying themes.

The blu ray transfer is STUNNING and the translation is considerably better than the Streamline Pictures version I saw in 1990.

This is a film any self-respecting sci fi film buff should have in their collection. It is the archetype of modern anime and should not be missed!!!",1325721600,,3126,4.797397769516729

626309,5,6303305520,"First, I just want to say everyone's reviews helped me a lot, so THANKS! I've been wanting Akira on dvd for awhile now. I had it on vhs and just never got around to the dvd. Anyway, the week of Thanksgiving I decided I was gonna get the blu-ray. I saw that it only had 4 stars and wondered why, so I read the comments. I'm glad I did! People were complaining about how the dialogue and voices were changed from the original dubbed release. I decided to do some research to see if you could even buy a version with the original dialogue and voice actors for the dub. Surprisingly enough my Google search took me to wikipedia! lol.

From Wikipedia ""Akira"" entry:

""Madman [Entertainment] has recently released a DVD/Blu-Ray combo which license is separate from the standalone Blu-Ray release because instead of the DVD version being the Manga Video UK version, it uses Madman/Manga's 2001 Special Edition DVD release which is licensed from Manga UK. The Australian Madman/Manga combo is the only Akira release in print that includes the original Streamline dub.""

I was ecstatic! So I went to Madman Entertainment's website to buy it and couldn't find it anywhere on their page! I then thought that some jerk put in false information on Wikipedia because, of course, that never happens. *smirk* From there I decided to search their forum page and score! I found a thread about how people couldn't find the blu-ray/dvd combo on the Madman site, etc. A Madman rep responded that it was an exclusive that they created for a store called JB Hi-Fi (it's kinda like Best Buy, I guess) and someone else provided a link to said combo. I ordered it! It came in the mail yesterday and it's awesome! The blu-ray is wonderfully done, so crisp and clean, but it's the dvd that has the original dub. Also, it comes in a limited edition steel case cover. I would recommend spending the few extra buck for this. About $44 after shipping fees.

626310,5,6303305520,"This is one I first got on the original VHS format that included the now defunct Streamline ""State of the art, Japanese animation"" trailer montage featuring the original Vampire Hunter D, Silent Mobius, Neo Tokyo, etc. I popped my anime cherry with Akira and Fist of the North Star, but it was Akira that really blew me away with its sci fi and especially its artwork, the amount of detail and movement in this film is massive. This film remains a primer for anyone remotely interested in knowing why people like me are so nuts about anime.

Basically, this film is a Frankenstein story that takes place in the year 2012 in Neo Tokyo, called so because it's right after a cataclysm similar to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A super powered boy named Akira who was the subject of secret government experimentation played a major part in the cataclysm and for this reason is contained in a cryogenic vault at ground zero, which is beneath a stadium. Determined to master and control ""the ultimate power,"" the government sets its sights on another guinea pig, a short, unstable, biker named Tetsuo who happens to be obsessed with a cool, red, turbo-charged bike owned by his best friend Kaneda.

This film looks incredible. The colors just pop at you scene after scene. The opening scenes at night are simply breathtakingly colorful. Comparisons to another cyber-punk classic from which this film derives its look, Bladerunner, are especially evident in its use of neon against a night backdrop. Amazing what can be done without 3d or cgi. The rainbows chasing the motorbikes, the motorbikes themselves, the clothes, the cityscape--everything about this film is eye-candy, almost too sweet, but I love it.

Despite the visual achievements of this film, the dialogue is embarrassing and cliched. Mr. Otomo shows his weaknesses in the writing department here but I'm not sure if this isn't due to it being translated into English. Maybe it sounds better in Japanese. But here it sounds very hokey. But in the end it didn't matter to me as it most likely won't matter if you see this film for the first time. Even after all these years, as far as animation has come, Akira still looks good. I think what makes this film age well is the fact that what you see on the screen is completely organic, that is, done by real people, an army of people working day and night to bring this enormous vision to life.

626314,2,6303305520,"The following review is of the blu-ray disc itself as a product and NOT of the movie. When I was a wee lad of 13 a friend of mine loaned me an long-play VHS tape with a whole bunch of Anime on it. After skimming through a project A-Ko movie and some Dragon Ball Z episodes I decided that I did not care for Anime as a whole and was about to turn off the TV when the first few seconds of AKIRA came on and....

...blew my teenage freakin' mind.

So you can imagine my joy when I discovered that Akira was out on Blu-ray and I could now watch my favorite movie of all time in stunning HD awesomeness. Only problem was that once I popped that bad boy in...it wasn't the same movie.

For reasons I do not understand the original dub of Akira was never even transferred over to DVD (to my knowledge and if you know otherwise....help a brother out). So the movie that I fell in love with doesn't exist anymore except on VHS. Why? You're guess is as good as mine. The original movie had awesome voice acting and is literally ingrained in my subconscious. So yeah...the fact that there are not only new voices in the mix...but new dialogue as well = not ok with me. There is no reason that the original dub should not (at the very least) be included. I want to watch the Akira I ""grew up"" with. I don't care how accurate the new dub is to the original translation and neither does anybody else I think.

Sure the old dub was a little goofy at times, but there are parts of the new dub where characters mouths are moving without any dialogue! WTF?!? I wanted to see my favorite movie of all time - not a ""different take on it"". I was able to watch the Japanese version without getting too worked up and it was interesting to see the differences in the dialogue that honestly help the movie make a bit more sense with respect to the book...but I don't want that. I want the Akira I knew and loved.

I don't understand this phenomenon of re-releasing movies that were perfectly fine to begin with new scenes and dialogue (Suck it George Lucas BTW). Do we need a high-def version of the Mona Lisa as redone by another artist?

No. Why? Because the original has a charm and uniqueness that can't be replicated and the minute you do you remove what makes it special.

Same deal here.",1315440000,7,2269,4.238425925925926
626363,5,6303305520,"It is difficult to believe that this Japanese anime classic from Katsuhiro tomo is now more than 20 years old. The graphics remain stunning, the musical soundtrack fresh and the story line massive in sweep; the only real sign of its age being its immense 2-hour running time. This release is a beautiful restoration of the original print (almost all copies of which have either been lost, worn out or else are firmly in the hands of collectors) with vibrant colour, crisp visuals and an excellent remastered musical soundtrack.  True to its manga origins, the film is intense and action-packed (as well as graphically violent and gory). It is also frenetic in pace -- especially as it tries to condense an original manga story that appeared in weekly serialised form over an 8 year period; even in simplified form, with a reduced array of characters, the story is often hard to follow. The 2001 English language dub that features in this release tries to capture some of the energy of the Japanese and as such is perhaps the weakest element in this release; for preference, I would recommend viewing in Japanese, with subtitles.

Even if you're not a fan of manga or anime, this release is well worth a viewing, both as a cult classic and as enormously influential cyberpunk masterpiece years ahead of its time.",1312934400,,1311,4.79646017699115

Case in point, the test subjects are all over the age of 30 (seen in the flashbacks over 30 years ago as they knew Akira) yet they have been given weak childrens voices. None of the characterssound the same or even as you would expect thenm to.

To top it all off, the dialouge has been changed. This is a good and bad thing. Good because it makes for a more cohearant story, so first time viewers know what is happening without needing to watch it 2 or 3 times. Bad because it gets prety ridiculus sometimes and doesnt seem to follow the amimation of the mouths. Some of it just seems stupid. In the opening scene when the customer enters the bar, instead of asking for ""Red Bennies, 3 of them."" he instead requests 3 packs of peanuts.

All in all, I was not too pleased with the blu-ray edition because besides better audio (and the new voice track) there was no goodies we've come to expect on this platform.

A brilliant, beautifully animated and visually stunning Science Fiction action thriller from Japan that is considered the ultimate anime movie ever and it is. Katsuhiro Otomo who created the manga comics in 1982 has written, produced and directed this masterpiece of cinema for it was unleashed in Japan back in 1988 to become one of the highest grossing movies in the countries history. In 1989 when it hit the United States by Streamline Pictures (An MGM company) in theaters it became a sleeper hit mainly in arthouse theaters in the cities then it took the world by storm re-establishing and making Japanimation popular. Although it's not quite as excellent as the Manga that spawned this movie, it's still a masterpiece of animation and Science Fiction that offers a complex storyline, awesome characterization, action (complete with gore), a memorable music score and it's also about questioning the existence of humanity or what if we messed with something that wasn't meant to be opened. This movie was praised and favored by many Hollywood filmmakers such as James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, The Wachowski Brothers, Michael Bay, Jonathan Mostow, Ridley and Tony Scott, Christopher Nolan and so much more as it's an influential work of art that still has it's audience today.

I remembered when i was 14 years old in May of 1996 after reading an amazing article on Japanese animation in Newsweek that stated everything from Akira, Ghost in The Shell, Totoro, Ninja Scroll, Grave of the Fireflies and others.

I had my share of previous experiences in anime since i was a kid with Voltron, Jack and The Beanstalk, Unico and more but Vampire Hunter D in 1993 on TBS was awesome as was Robot Carnival. This movie made me a bigger anime fan that i am today and became my favorite animated movie.

626440,4,6303305520,"Before I go off reviewing this anime, I'll share my personal history with it, which dates back eight years ago.

I remember staying up late at night and at the stroke of midnight, the date of July 15, 2002 just started (I wanted everyone to be asleep in my house).  I put a Streamline Pictures VHS copy of Akira into my VCR and had no idea what to expect out of it since I had virtually no experience with anime, with the exceptions of watching Pokemon from 1999-2000 (I'm not proud of this) and Gigantor back in 1992-93.  Since I never really watched any animated material of Akira's magnitude, I was overwhelmed by it and sat around the house in a complete daze for about a week.  It was also so impressive, it turned me on to the whole anime genre and even convinced me to pursue a career where I can put my drawing skills to work.  After watching Akira for the first time, I came out a changed teenage boy.  For a really long time, I considered Akira not only the pinnacle of animation, but also the pinnacle of cinema.  However, after the crash increase of my anime consumption in the last year that's nearly parallel to Stalin's crash industrialization of the USSR, and an all around more serious focus on film in general, I've noticed some flaws that keep this from being the masterpiece that many anime fans claim it as.

STORY

Akira is set in Neo-Tokyo circa 2019, 31 years after World War 3.  Underneath the gigantic, glowing skyscrapers and neon signs that dominate the metropolis, Neo-Tokyo is a cesspool of filth and crime. Bike gangs are constantly at war and people are constantly protesting the government's actions and a feeble economy.  During a biker battle, Tetsuo gets injured in a crash caused by a mysterious, blue-skinned boy.  Soon, his mentor and childhood friend, Kaneda, gets involved with a terrorist group trying to stop the government's dangerous experiments on these mysterious children.  Tetsuo soon gains unbelievably strong psychic powers and can possibly go mad with them.

APPEARANCE

One of Akira's best strengths is its visuals.  For an anime made in 1987, the animation is unbelievably smooth and the artwork has no shred of compromise in even the smallest details.  Over 300 colors of paint were used in the production of this anime and the scenes taking place at night are impressive in that so many shades were used to render the imagery instead of just using black and maybe one or two shades of blue, which was a common practice back then.  Even the most menial ""extra"" character will move to bring life to the environment.  There's even some flashy visual effects with the motorcycles' tail lights with a dragging illumination effect when they move quickly in the night.  Since Akira takes place in the fairly distant future, it's certainly looks like it concerning the architecture of the city and the technology of weapons, motorcycles, and other devices; the army even has nifty laser rifles that actually look like what would be realistic laser weapons instead of the laser weaponry we'd think of when watching the original Star Wars Trilogy.  However, I noticed that the characters in this anime absolutely reek of 80's fashion and cultural trends.  The best example of this would be the biker groupies since they look like fashionistas plucked right out of 1987.  Though admittedly, the 80's-looking characters do add some sort of nostalgic charm to this anime, that is if you're an 80's junkie like myself.  Akira was also the first anime to incorporate decent-looking computer effects into cel animation (Golgo 13 was technically the first, but those effects looked quite bad).  The computer effects are shown in the ""mental growth"" projector in the head scientist's lab, and they look fantastic since they don't look like blocks, but rather tye-dyed waves that perfectly fit the context of the technology employed in that particular scene.

CHARACTERS

For me, the characters could use some significant tweaking, hence why the rating for this is faily low compared to, say, Battle Angel.  The only two really developed characters in this anime are Kaneda and Tetsuo.  This is so because they're the only two characters that we really sit down and get to know, so to speak.  Kaneda and Tetsuo both had to live as orphans throughout their lives.  Tetsuo was always a runt while Kaneda has had to act like the ""big brother"" and bail him out of trouble when needed.  When Tetsuo's goes mad with his psychic powers and takes it out on everyone, it feels completely understandable as to why he'd act like this given his rough upbringing.  That's really were the well-developed characters end because unfortunately, it feels like the rest of the cast was there just to keep the story flowing, which is a shame because these characters were well developed in the original Akira manga series (which I own).  Examples of half-baked characters would be Kay and the Colonel.  All we really know about Kay is that she's a terrorist trying to stop the government from destroying the city much like they did over 30 years ago, and that the Colonel is really cynical of the government's experiments on the ""Numbers,"" or the psychic children.  Sadly, some characters exist solely for extra ""mature content.""  The best example would be Tetsuo's girlfriend, Kaori.  She seems to be there only for a rough topless scene and a grizzly fate, which is unfortunate since in the manga, she was really important in preserving some shreds of humanity within Tetsuo.  I honestly don't know why people quickly bash Doomed Megalopolis for its violence and sexual content but overlook that previously stated observation.

THEMES

This is where people have gone overboard in fabricating artificial claims to inflate the status of Akira. While there's certainly more intelligent content in this one than the typical Hollywood fare and to justify the intense focus on visuals, I feel it's underwhelming compared to superior anime titles like Grave of the Fireflies and Ghost in the Shell.  Lots of people have been saying that there's ""really thought-provoking themes about Zen and Buddhism"" and all that other jazz, but I have not seen anything in this anime to justify those particular claims.  However, it does have some thought-provoking elements about what life can be like if people attained massive powers, making them somewhat god-like.  This is almost exclusively elaborated upon when Kaneda and Kay get incarcerated for a failed break in to the government facility, where Kay is fed through one of the numbers about the energy that flows through life and to give some insight using an analogy with an amoeba having a human's power, which is somewhat like an analogy to a human having a god's power.

MATURE CONTENT

While not one of the most extreme anime titles I've seen in this area, this is certainly not an anime I'd let kids see.  Akira has a pretty significant amount of bloodshed, especially towards the beginning where a terrorist operative is gunned down by the army and blood just sprays everywhere.  As stated before, there's even an unsavory scene where enemy bikers sexually assault Kaori, rendering her topless and with a bloody nose.  Tetsuo's hallucinations are quite disturbing to watch, because some of them involve him falling through crumbling concrete and because of the fall's intense impact, his entrails just spill all over the ground, while he's desperately scooping them back into his belly.  Even some hallucinations aren't particularly violent, but are quite messed up because it's not everyday that you see a giant teddy bear, bunny rabbit, and toy car try to attack someone.  Towards the end of the movie, Tetsuo's body mutates into a giant cybernetic blob that looks like nothing within the confines of simple explanation, but all I can say is that it looks REALLY gross.

SOUNDTRACK

Akira actually has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in an anime.  So much so, I actually got motivated to buy a CD copy of it (same with Ghost in the Shell and Doomed Megalopolis).  Geinoh Yamashirogumi did a fantastic job composing the music for Akira because he employs a huge variety of instruments such as keyboards, steel drums, and ethnic Japanese instruments to create heart-racing sounds beyond description.  The music creates a large variety of moods that perfectly fit the scenes they're used in.  There's creepy yet ponderous ambient keyboard passages to give the audience a feeling of dark uneasiness, such as when Tetsuo makes his way to the room where the Numbers reside. There's tracks that sound aggressive and bizarre, such as the music played when Tetsuo mutates into the giant blob.  Even if you're not a hardcore fan of Akira, you may want to get the soundtrack because on its own, it makes for great listening.

ACTION SCENES

Akira, being an action anime, delivers some pretty awesome action scenes.  This is probably the only anime where you see biker fight each other, psychic juggernauts fight other psychics, and psychic juggernauts fight arrogant punk biker leaders armed with laser rifles.  Seeing the opening where Kaneda's gang chases and fights the Clowns is still exciting today and for the most part, the two fights between Kaneda and Tetsuo towards the end still get my heart racing.  The only part I didn't like is that after the SOL gets destroyed, they had to throw in a completely pointless comedic bit where Kaneda has to run away from a bunch of falling debris that would be more appropriate in a Roadrunner short than a serious anime.  All in all, the action scenes are cool.

OLD DUB VS NEW DUB

If you don't know already, two English dubs exist for Akira.  One being created back in 1989 by Streamline Pictures, which most notably features Cam Clarke of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fame, and the other being made in 2001 by Pioneer, which notably features Johnny Yong Bosch of Power Rangers fame.  I consider myself extremely lucky to have watched Akira with the Streamline dub first because the Pioneer dub for it is absolutely deplorable.  Many people have slammed the Streamline dub for it's ""cartoony"" aesthetic and that the lines don't fit the original Japanese script.  I don't think these are solid points because while yes, the Pioneer dub has a translation closer to the original script, any respectable translator will tell you that quality translations aren't word-by-word, otherwise they'd be really boring.  To reinforce this point, there's a line in the Streamline dub where Kaneda says ""Just when my coils were hitting the green line.""  In the new dub, he says ""Just when my motor coils were heating up.""  The former has more character and sounds like something a hardcore biker would say in an English-speaking context, the latter sounds dull.  As for the previously-stated ""cartoony"" aspect to the Streamline dub, I don't really care because I loved the Ninja Turtles back in the early 90's, and that Cam Clarke gives Kaneda a much needed ""arrogant punk"" tone to his voice, and that the other cast in this dub feels just right for their roles.  However, in the Pioneer Dub, Bosch makes Kaneda sound like a whiny upper class kid in Burbank, completely sucking away any grittiness or coolness his character might have had; and that in general, Bosch has a terrible voice.  I even remember buying the ""special edition"" DVD about five days after first watching Akira and was ready to murder someone after hearing the new voice overs, so I sold it and bought an old Streamline VHS copy to introduce my friends to it until the Aussies got it right on DVD.  I know there's some old-time fans who loathe the Pioneer dub and I don't blame you.  If you guys have a regionless DVD player or a computer that can play DVDs from other regions, the Australian (Region 4) DVD of Akira has the Streamline dub on it with the remastered picture quality.  If you don't really care about dubs, I urge you to only watch this in Japanese, which is on all the DVDs and the Blu-ray releases.

MY SUGGESTIONS

Akira really could have been the masterpiece many people see it as.  Katsuhiro Otomo, if you're reading this right now, swish the following in your head and give it some deep consideration.  Please remake Akira into a four part OVA series with each installment being an hour long.  You can use the same story you wrote for the movie adaptation and even keep many of the plot points the same, but please use the extra allotted time to develop the characters much better and to flesh out the intellectual themes much better.

FINAL WORD

Akira ISN'T the untouchable masterpiece that people claim it to be, but it's a good anime nonetheless, and if you like fairly intelligent action anime, then it'll probably sit comfortably in your collection. However, you're better off reading the Akira manga.  If you're just starting off with the anime genre, here's some masterful anime titles that make Akira pale in comparison to.

626442,4,6303305520,"This Blu-Ray isn't much better than the DVD that I've had for many years.  Some scenes may appear to be sharper on Blu-Ray, but some scenes are better on the DVD.  So, since there is an inconsistency of the improved quality of the film, I see no reason to buy the Blu-Ray version.  I borrowed my nephew's version to compare because the store I saw it at wanted over $35 for the Blu-Ray.  But, I've learned by watching them both, side by side, that my DVD version is just as good.

You know, my previous Samsung Progressive scan DVD player with the HDMI hook-up option, really made my old DVD's look better than my first DVD player did, anyway.  So, if your DVD player has the HDMI hook-up, you're going to find that replacing your DVD's with Blu-Ray may not impress you with any visual improvements that you'd be hoping for.  Although, I have discover that some Blu-Ray releases have shown a greater re-mastering effort, but only because the DVD version wasn't mastered very well in the first place.  I've got some great looking DVD's.  I don't think it will be necessary to replace them with Blu-Ray unless they sell for maybe $10 or less.

Anyway, this is a movie that I have on DVD that I thought would probably look better on Blu-ray Hi-Definition, but I wasn't impressed.  Besides, I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I will only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less, and if it is a great movie.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.

I'm definitely going to be very selective of how I buy Blu-Ray discs.  I've bought just 30 BD discs in the past year and I just bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  I just wasn't that anxious to buy a Blu-ray disc player although I know I've bought some Blu-Ray discs where I'd like to someday see a better quality picture of a film that I truly enjoy..  When I eventually bought about 24 Blu-Ray discs, I bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  But, I must maintain spending discipline on my Blu-Ray disc expenses!  It's very important that I live this way for my movie library.  Because, before you know it, they will eventually come out with something better than Blu-ray, like 1500p resolution.  You know, that's not too far-fetched to imagine.  Blu-Ray is simply not the end to improved video quality.  I hope you all know that.

UPDATE: I've just recently bought a new 47"" LCD TV.  Maybe this was a mistake because it is NOW that I see a great improvement of my Blu-Ray DVD's over my regular DVD's.  So, I guess the only way that I can continue enjoying my regular DVD's is to keep watching my DVD's only on my 32"" LCD TV with the HDMI hook-up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.  On the 47"" TV, regular DVD's just don't look that good.",1272153600,2,3148,4.390328151986183
626473,5,6303305520,"I'll join the chorus of others in saying that AKIRA was my first real foray into Japanese animation, and nothing else in that spectrum -- not even Miyazaki's works -- has quite captured my imagination with the same intensity as this film.  Every single element is amplified to the maximum with the apocalyptic stakes of the story, the layered storytelling, and the ferocity of technique; AKIRA is ultra-violent, ultra-detailed, ultra-colorful, and ultra-LOUD.  It is nothing less than an overwhelming experience.

Which is why this Blu-ray is such a marvel.  I first encountered this film on its two-disc Pioneer release, and while I thought it looked good at the time, the Blu-ray blows it out of the water.  I never realized that Otomo drew these characters with irises in their eyes!  Fine detail is much improved, and the colors are saturated and vibrant.  While as a traditionally-animated film it lacks that three-dimensional ""pop"" associated with the finest live-action transfers, the visual presentation on this disc is astounding and a tremendous upgrade over the DVD.

Unfortunately, my audio set-up doesn't support the 24-bit, 192 kHz Japanese TrueHD track that everyone is raving about, but even the Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital track roared on my system.  My biggest pet peeve with the Pioneer set was that the original Japanese performances were only available in the stereo track (which is also provided here in PCM), so even with this ""lesser"" track I am quite pleased.  I've not watched the film with the English TrueHD track as I find the English dub somewhat lacking.

My only real complaint is that almost none of the special features from that Pioneer set have been carried over to this release, including the making-of documentary, the piece on the unique musical score, or the interview with Otomo.  All that is here are trailers and storyboards, so if you want these features, you'll have to either keep or procure a copy of the second disc of that Pioneer set.  I've got mine temporarily in a paper sleeve and plan on purchasing a two-disc Blu-ray case in the future to keep it close at hand.  This is really a small grievance, however, because the presentation quality of this newest release is so wonderful.  It really is the best way to enjoy AKIRA, barring a theatrical presentation.

Absolutely worth the upgrade.  A phenomenal presentation of a phenomenal film.",1271289600,,2390,4.994949494949495

From personal experience, I have only read 5 of the 6 graphic novels ( I refuse to pay 60 to 80 bucks for volume 6, so I will wait until January 2011 for it to be re-released) I love the comic, and I believe Mr. Otomo made the movie this way because, deep down, he knew he was never going to be able to successfully cram the manga into the movie.  So he decided to take it in a different direction entirely.  Did he succeed?  I think he did in a way.  Tetsuo comes off as a very real character, and this makes him the star of the film.  Kaneda's character is the biggest flaw of the film because it's difficult to get into.  He comes off as too macho.  The love story between him and Kei is completely dropped and crapped on.  These are the two biggest problems, but they're not the only ones.(Another reviewer labeled them) Akira doesn't even show up until the end, and, when you think he will, it's something else entirely.  Tetsuo said it best,""What the HELL is THIS?!"" The truth is that I love the film.  Is it the greatest animes ever? No.  Is it in my top three list?  Oh yea.

626479,1,6303305520,"For years I'd heard all kinds of accolades heaped on this film, running the gamut of ""greatest anime ever made"" to ""film that changed everything."" So before I even watched it, I sat down and read all 6 volumes of the original manga from cover to cover, starting from the opening sequence of Tokyo being blown up in Volume 1 to the very last scene of Volume 6.

And boy, am I glad I did, because this is probably one of the most brilliantly written and visually compelling graphic novels ever created. I know that sounds totally ""fanboy"", but I don't mean to be. The manga truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. That's not to say it's not without flaws, but that it's as close as you can get to perfection.

So imagine my shock when I finally saw this film, the so-called ""best anime ever made"", the one so many anime fans have been raving about. As I watched this film, I didn't feel awe and amazement, but something decidedly different-- the sense that this was probably one of the WORST adaptations of a literary work ever in the history of cinema.

Many people have defended the poor adaptation with the excuse that ""there wasn't enough time to put everything from the book into the movie."" But this is a straw man. The anime is not poorly adapted because it didn't cram everything from the manga into the movie. It's poorly adapted, because Otomo himself changed his original story so dramatically that it doesn't even come close to resembling the manga in any real sense. It's almost as if the screenplay had been adapted by someone who'd never read Akira a day in his life.

If you think I'm exaggerating, here are some very specific examples of how badly Otomo eviscerated his own work in adapting it to screen:

1) A majority of the events in this film never happened in the manga, and very few of the events in the manga occur in the film. Of the few incidents from the manga included in the film, they happen in a completely different context than in the manga.

2) Characters who died tragically in the book either live in the movie or die in a completely different way than they did in the manga, usually in a manner that is far less dramatic or moving

3) Kaori, the street urchin who Tetsuo's henchman randomly picked off the streets to be his slave, is his girlfriend in the movie

4) Kiyoko, Masaru, and Takahashi are vicious brats who aggressively attack Tetsuo, when it was Tetsuo who was the aggressor

5) Chiyoko doesn't exist, and neither do any of the characters associated with Miyako or Akira's ""kingdom"" after the destruction of Neo-Tokyo. Nezu, Ryu and other side characters are just thrown in for the hell of it. The scientists in Volume 6 don't exist, and the cigarette fiend makes a small cameo.

6) Remember how much the drugs were a part of the story? They don't figure here at all, except, once again, as a mere cameo (Kaneda wears a pill on his jacket; Tetsuo tries to score drugs off a barkeep)

The most egregious cases in which Otomo dramatically altered his story:

1) He decided he wanted to make ""Kiyoko"" the ""wise sage"" in the movie, so he destroyed Lady Miyako's character. In the book, she was the philosophical heart of the story, a central figure very similar to the Oracle character in the Matrix. In the movie, she's transformed from wise and caring sage to crazed lunatic ranting that Neo-Tokyo needs to ""burn"" to be purified. So whereas in the book she was a protector of people and wise sage, in the movie she's a religious nut who wants them to burn in a ""rapture-like"" blaze. To add insult to injury, she's given a man's voice to make her seem more crazy, and she's casually killed off along with some anonymous city rabble after two brief cameos that couldn't have lasted more than 20 seconds each.

2) And Akira? I'm not going to spoil it for you, but if you see what ""Akira"" is in this movie, you'll literally shake your head wondering what in the hell Otomo was thinking. The change defies logic, because in changing him so radically he essentially rewrote his own story beyond recognizability.

All of these dramatic changes would be forgivable if this new version of Akira was entertaining and well written in its own right. Unfortunately, I can't say that it is. I found it painfully boring and convoluted. Not only was the pace plodding, the screenplay was muddled to the point where even I-- who'd read the story-- had trouble following what was going on. So it definitely wasn't a compelling movie for me.

I know I'm gonna tick off a lot of hardcore fans of this movie, but I'm sorry-- as a huge fan of the manga, it's impossible for me to consider it as ""the best ever"" when it did such a terrible job of adapting the original story to screen. Watch it for the animation if you will, or the nostalgia of having viewed this ""revolutionary anime"" from when it first came out, or out of curiosity to see what the fuss is all about. But if you're a fan of the manga, I would seriously pass. It's definitely not the adaptation you hoped and dreamed for; if anything, it's the stuff that nightmares are made of.",1262304000,10,5080,4.494577006507592
626480,4,6303305520,"It's easy to see why 'Akira' became one of the first anime to be really successful in the West. The dark, apocalyptic storyline was very different from the usual Japanese magical girls and fighting robots, and there was plenty of flashy eye-candy in the form of outstanding animation (for its time). However, while the style is great, the substance is lacking.

The fundamental problem with 'Akira' is that it is a 2 hour movie cobbled together from a very long manga, meaning the story is compressed and rushed almost to the point of incomprehensibility. There are so many important plot points that are skimmed over or left out altogether, and the pacing of the movie is poor. Most of the important plot points (involving Tetsuo) are dispensed with reasonably early in the film, and the entire second half is given over to Tetsuo's rampage and destruction. They should have cut this down and spent more time fleshing out the story.

Another problem is the characterisation. Since the main characters are mostly biker punks or ruthless military/medical men, there isn't exactly much room for depth and sensitivity. In fact, it's pretty two-dimensional to be honest. Kaneda is a sort of anti-hero, and he does at least show some development and growing maturity over the course of the film. Kei is probably the closest thing to a true heroine, while The Colonel has some humanity to him despite being the main antagonist.

Sure, given the flashy and action-packed nature of this anime, you can just switch off your brain and enjoy the eye-candy. On a very basic ""I'm mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore!"" level, the film is easy enough to follow. But to truly understand 'Akira' requires the utmost concentration, and almost certainly multiple viewings. This is the issue with the film: blood and guts action fans will probably not want to make such an in-depth investment, but the more intellectual fans might be put off by the pointless violence and brutality.

From the viewpoint of 2009, 'Akira' is arguably more important for its influence than for what it actually is. However, its historical importance is enormous, and despite its major flaws remains essential for every anime fan.",1255651200,3,2195,4.924324324324324

It's always strange to come away from a movie disliking it and then see a plethora of reviews hailing it as the best thing ever. Inevitably doubt sets in, and I find myself wondering what it is that all those other people saw in this movie that I did not, but I just didn't like ""Akira"" at all.

Where do I start? I guess my biggest problem with this film is the overwhelming sense that important details (such as character motivation) have been blithely omitted on the grounds that ""deep"" or ""meaningful"" movies don't need such petty concerns. Tetsuo in particular seems driven by no motivation other than malevolent evil and madness and feels like a terrible rendition of a DBZ villain - he only seems interested in fighting for the fight itself, in order to be the most powerful one left standing. That kind of motivation is fine enough in a Bond shoot-em-up, but I expect more from a movie that's supposed to make me think. Kaneda, too, seems motivated not from character development or environment constraints, but merely because the movie *requires* him to behave in certain ways. It seems unreasonable that Kaneda would practically throw away his life trying to kill Tetsuo - or rather, it seems not at all unreasonable for a *movie character* to do such a thing, but a ""realistic"" character would seemingly take the first chance to make himself scarce... or at least consider it. Kaneda seems not even to acknowledge the possibility.

Other questions abound. Why do the strange children look so old and green, and why do they attack Tetsuo, and why do they attack him with teddy bears bleeding milk from their eye sockets? Why are all the biker kids almost completely interchangeable, dialogue and all? Why is the government willing to pour money into a super-secret super-kid project, and then only hire a handful of guards and one scientist to guard these expensively godly goblins? Why, for the love of all that is sane, are all heroines required by law to fall for the hero who is rude, largely foolish and ineffectual, and has a bad tendency to flash the words ""author insert character"" above his head in green neon letters?

As for the touted depth and complexity behind this movie, I was blown away with the ""explanation"" (courtesy of the heroine) that ants are born with less power than humans, but what if an ant was accidentally born with the power of a human? What a huge mix-up that would be! Only, I wasn't aware that it was ""power"" that made us humans so special - I thought it was things like arms and legs and thumbs and a brain that is somewhat larger and more complicated than that of an ant. I'm told the whole thing is supposed to be a Buddhist analogy for something, but as a method to drive the story and explain the character motivation, it doesn't do the job, in my personal opinion.

I can't help but also note that for a ""deep"" and ""meaningful"" movie, this film seems to enjoy itself far too much with the rampant gore and female frontal nudity. One female character - a sweet biker groupie whose boyfriend treats her with complete contempt - seems to exist *solely* for the purpose of sexual violence being played out upon her (twice), while the heroes helplessly watch - there's a tangible feeling of voyeurism and sadism overlaying her character that made me uncomfortable, to say the least.

After reading some of the reviews, I suspect that ""Akira"" might be one of those movies that you have to be part of the 'in-group' in order to properly understand and appreciate it. And that's fine - it's not my place to start demanding explanations, character motivation, development, or basic plot elements over special effects and in-group backstory. But if you're not already a part of the Akira fan base, and are an outsider like me, then be aware that you may end up as frustrated and irritated by this movie as I was. Then again, Roger Ebert apparently liked this film well enough, so it's entirely possible that I'm just in the minority.

I was on preorder for this to get the exclusive first press with the booklet and sleeve. So what do I get 10 weeks LATE? The average-joe version. Definitely NOT worth the $40 I paid.

Movie looks and sounds the best it ever has but the total lack of extras - no 20th+ anniversary special extras or anything seems a waste of the blu-ray's capacity and a cheap ca$h grab on Bandai's part.

So I am both glad to have it and ticked-off with it at the same time.

Having read the superbly illustrated comic book, I know how much of the story they've left out, but this one holds together quite well, until the ending at least. Akira himself barely appears in the film, although he's in the book quite a lot, ditto for the Joker, Chiyoko (who doesn't appear at all in the movie, although she's an awesome character) and Lady Miyako. Key characters in the story are Kaneda and Kei, who navigate the madness and anarchy of Tokyo in the year 2031, driving motorcycles, flying in mini-helicopters, shooting lasers and avoiding satellite-mounted death rays, while also seeking to avoid being smothered by the grotesque, out-of-control evolutions of Tetsuo.",1247270400,,808,5.175572519083969

Although, the movie does get a lot of the main scenes and events right from the original manga, the story was completely butchered. Akira is a 5 book series spanning 1500 pages. There was absolutely no way to make it into a movie and keep it accurate.

A lot of these reviewers complain about the voice-over acting being redone and I have to agree with them although I haven't heard the original. A lot of the time, the voice acting just doesn't set the tone for the insanity that's going on.

After the thoroughly disappointing Pioneer release on DVD, I was hoping somebody would have gotten a clue and included the original English audio track (as the Region 4 DVD release does).

Alas, this version only provides the ""new"" English audio track -- the politically correct version made just for America.  What's the point of having 50GB of room if you can't even include the original English track?  I don't recommend this for anybody who really cares about the film.  5 stars for the improved picture, but minus 3 for the horrible ""new"" English audio track being the only option.

The Dolby 5.1 English track was totally new with new actors... What's wrong with the old English actors? NOTHING! Why on earth did they change the English track? I'm so used to the English voices this annoyed me! I traditionally watch Japanese animes in Japanese, but Akira is the only anime I enjoy in English.

Stay away from this Blu-ray unless you really want the better picture -- maybe play the special DVD on another player and sync the audio.

626577,5,6303305520,"In the year 2018, World War 3 has passed, and the world is still around. Everything seems about the same, but just a lot crummier. Kaneda and Tetsuo are friends from a young age that are now around 18 years old and in a biker gang with some of their other good friends. They are at war with another biker gang called the Clowns, and get into fight with their bikes in the middle of the streets and highways. While Tetsuo is chasing down another biker, he almost runs over a little kid in the middle of the street, except that his bike blows up and leaves Tetsuo flat on the ground... thanks to the kid. The military comes to grab the child and also takes Tetsuo back to a military installation to perform some experiments on him that unlocks a great, though lethal, power inside of him.  As Tetsuo is trying to break out, Kaneda is trying to break in to find and rescue his friend. The power though that is swirling inside of Tetsuo is beginning to take control of him and what Kaneda finds later is not the Tetsuo he remembers.

I remember seeing this 1988 movie somewhere around 1994 and being absolutely blown away. The attention to detail was something like I had never seen before in movie cartoons. The backgrounds were robust with moving people, cars, papers, lights, anything really. The movements in the actual drawings that we were supposed to be watching were so fluid and meticulously drawn it was mesmerizing. Even after 20 years, this movie still holds up. Just last night as I was watching this I looked at my friend many times and said ""Holy crap man, that looked so good"". The first thing I remember from this movie from so long ago was the bike fight scene at the beginning. The first time I saw the trail of light from the break lights as a bike zoomed off, I believe my nipples got a little hard. That's how awesome it was. And there are even some pretty `gross' scenes in this movie. Like when a guy gets his face bashed on a drive by with a lead pipe. I ""OOOOOOO'd!!"" out loud to that... haha. The story itself though can get a little confusing. I think it took me 3 or 4 seeings to actually get it. Mainly cause I was to in awe the whole time just watching the movie.

In the end, I would definitely give this movie a shot. I own it and love that I do. If you are an anime fan, you'd better have seen this cause this movie has to be in the top 5 best animes ever.

P.S. - I own the tin can 2 disc edition. LOVE IT. Also the scene that ALWAYS sticks out in my head in this movie is the hallway scene where he blows people up. It was drawn so fluidly well it's ridiculous.",1237161600,3,2593,4.221774193548387

After watching it i was like ""woah"". I mean the only other cartoons i had watched were disney, thundercats, transformers etc. This shocked me deeply as a kid, but i LOVED it, actually inspired me to want to become an artist. I had never seen anything like it before. Liked it so much i begged my mum to buy the video for me hahaha ( good ol mum )

And now 15 years later i have picked up the blu-ray copy, WOW the animation rebuff is incredible, never thought i would view akira in such stunning format. The only problem i found with this release was the exclusion of the streamline dub (which i find others on here feel the same). As i was saying before about my childhood experience watching the film, i really connected in a way listening to those voices for the characters, hearing the new pioneer dub absolutely killed my feeling and care for the characters. Yes it is a better dub in the case of mouth sync, but after having the streamline dub from 1990 (or whateva) up until 2001 , you would have so many people who would have become used to hearing the streamline (like me) and then hearing these unfamiliar voices thinking ""is this the same movie?""

626610,2,6303305520,"I got this because I am an audiophile and Akira fan.  Unfortunately it won't play on my LG BH200.  It just spins the disk with a blank screen.  I think it's because of the reported English/Japanese option at the beginning, but I'm only guessing.  I've also heard the LG300 has a problem and the Samsung 5000 combo player.  While I would love to totally blame LG, they are only partially at fault for not updating their players for every single movie that comes out.  Ultimately, it's the disk's fault.  I've thrown hundreds of disks at my player and never had a problem.  This is a major disappointment and I hope can be resolved by a firmware update by LG.  But who knows when that will happen?  This is the pain of blu-ray, where standards change with every new release.  I guess I should have gotten a  PS3 after all...

Hopefully I can amend this review in the near future.

EDIT: A work-around!  For me and my Lg BH200 I wait until it sticks on the black screen and then hit stop and stop again, then press 'disc menu'.  This sequence will take me to the main menu where I can select to watch the movie.  Though very irritating, I can at least watch the movie now.
And now for the review:
Playing the Jap TrueHd track I noticed how BIG the sound was.  Huge 'in my room' sound.  Clean sound too, with no harshness at all.  But, it was only the front 2 speakers.  Even  though I bought a high end receiver  (marantz sr7002) last year, it cannot play 5.1 channels in the 192khz that Akira puts out.  I've never had a way to test this until now, but now the unfortunate truth comes home.
Here's the good news:  Even in Stereo it is my preferred track.  It's so rich, even without the surrounds.  I must warn you that I do have two full-range front speakers, so if you're using little cubes I don't know what it will be like for you.
Bad news:  Now, here's where it gets interesting.  I thought I might listen in EnglishHD to get surround.  It was just acceptable.  What I mean is it sounded fairly harsh compared to the JapHD and the dynamic sound was pretty flat, anemic.  I switched to JapDolby compressed and the sound nearly blew me out of my chair in comparison.  The Dolby in Jap still sounds like a compressed sound track, but  except for the brittle sound on the top it actually sounds BETTER than the EnglishHD.  I heard instruments I'd never heard before.  Further investigation revealed a totally new remastering for the Japanese tracks that had not been done for the English track.  All the new techniques applied to make the Japanese sound so good (HD or no)had not been applied in any way to the English track.  What this means is it's a slightly higher bitrate than older English releases, but is not that much better and in fact may be hampered by the space taken by the Japanese tracks.  After hearing the lossy Dolby in Japanese you almost get the sense that English was an afterthought.  This is somewhat disappointing, but true fans hate the pioneer dub anyway and are still crying over the loss of the original strangely translated Streamline version.  I'm trying to wean myself off the English track so I can enjoy the JapHD, even in stereo.  It really is that good.  But I think it could have sounded 90% as good if it had been 24bit/96khz which nearly every modern receiver can play in 5.1.  That 10% in quality cost me and probably 90% of every other customer their 3.1 channels of sound.  So, it's future proof, but I'll have to wait some time before I can hear it completely.  The picture is much better than DVD but it's not perfect.  Those expecting a Disney-like cleaning of the master might be disappointed to see some noise here and there.  But this is minor.  Overall it's still the best release to date, and probably the best will ever be.  I'm just disappointed they couldn't figure out a way to make it more compatible with select machines (see first review) and make it so people don't have to buy new high end equipment this year or next to hear it in 5.1.",1236038400,,3995,4.420329670329671

[THE BANDAI ""AKIRA"" BLU-RAY REVIEW]

""AKIRA"", the 1988 anime film that became the masterpiece of mangaka and director Katsuhiro Otomo.

My first viewing of ""AKIRA"" was back in 1993.  I have to be truthful, it was one of those films that I had to watch several times because I felt I was missing something integral.  Each time I watched the film, there was always something new that I picked up and for anyone who has seen this animated film, just how much was put into the animation, the detail for an animated film.

In 1988, Disney had ""Oliver & Friends"" and being touted as the first animation to utilize hand drawn art and computerized graphics and as the film incorporated some darkness that may scare the kiddies, in Japan, ""AKIRA"" was a film that would set records in the Summer and eventually get a limited release in theaters.

The film would surprise and shock people because this was not a children's animation, this was geared for adults.  And did it look awesome at that time!

Flash forward over 20-years later for the Blu-ray release!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

For one, the film is now in 1080p and 169.  Having seen this film evolve with each release from the VHS to LaserDisc and then DVD and now Blu-ray, for a film created back in 1988, ""AKIRA"" just looked amazing.

From the action scenes and just watching it on a large screen, I was amazed of how great it looked. Again, this is a 1988 release and I compared it to Disney's ""Oliver & Company"" which was remastered and recently released on DVD
.  But for an animation of that time, it looked like an animation of that time.  ""AKIRA"" looked fantastic!

The colors were vibrant, I swear I was noticing background art from the film for the first time and that's considering that I watched this film probably two dozen times already.

As for audio, this is where Bandai Entertainment has really gone out of their way to create a top-notch product.  Being audiophiles themselves, the full capacity of the Blu-ray disc was used for the audio.  ""AKIRA"" is the first film on Blu-ray that is released in 192 kHz/24-bit in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sound.  The highest level of sound quality attainable right now on contemporary media.

CD's are sampled in 44.1 kHz and reproduces at 20 kHz.  This Blu-ray is sampled in 192 kHz and reproduces at 96 kHz.  CD's are 16-bit, this Blu-ray Disc, the audio is 24-bit.  The original soundtrack of ""AKIRA"" was originally recorded as a master tape that contained frequencies up to 100 kHz and so, with Blu-ray technology, this soundtrack on the Blu-ray is how the composer intended for people to listen to it.

With that being said, the audio of ""AKIRA"" is just phenomenal.  From the music and the taiko drums, the the various sound effects of the motorcycles to the crowds that are protesting.  The film just comes alive with this soundtrack on Blu-ray and really, was floored by the outstanding quality.

I watched both Japanese and audio soundtracks.  A few things I need to let people know is when you see the menu being offered in Japanese or English, if you select Japanese, you get four choices of audio.  If you select English, you get only three selections (Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1ch track is not on the English selection but the Japanese menu selection) of audio but I'm sure that most fans will be listening to the Dolby TrueHD tracks.

Also, another note is that this release features the Pioneer 2001 English audio dub and not the 1991 Streamline dub.  Having been subjugated to the Streamline English dub which was terrible in my opinion, this Pioneer dub is more to my liking.

With that being said, with the Blu-ray disc focusing so much on audio quality and using the Blu-ray disc for that purpose, that would mean that special features that fans were accustomed to on the VHS or DVD release will not get on the Blu-ray disc, so don't toss your DVD's out just yet.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The Blu-ray disc was utilized completely for audio, thus there is not much room to put anything else.  Included are the two teaser trailers, the TV commercial, two trailers, storyboards (Still images) and a 32-page color booklet.

The 32-page color booklet features 16-pages that go into the science behind the creation of the audio for ""AKIRA"" and ""Hypersonic"" which is ""a medium that allows for the expression of something that was never possible for conventional sound limited to 20 kHz"".  Also, an ""Interview with Katsuhiro Otomo"", ""The Effect Animation That Made AKIRA Shine"" and more.

So, missing are the ""Production Report (The Making of Akira)"", ""Sound Clip (a documentary of the creation of the soundtrack), director's interview and the documentary on the Akira restoration that were included on the DVD.  So, don't throw away your black tin DVD special edition just yet.

The Blu-ray case comes with a slipcase (front cover shown above and rear-side features the image below) and according to Bandai Entertainment, the slipcase and the 32-page booklet  are part of the first press only.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""AKIRA"" will always be regarded as one of the top animated films of all time.  It set a precedence in animation quality in the late 80's and the 90's due to its detailed scenery, the vocal dub matching the lips (""AKIRA"" was the first anime production featuring voice acting done before the animation was completed) and utilized over 160,000+ animated cels in order to achieve the fluid motion throughout the film.  Again, this was animation geared for adults and has become a classic, must-own animated film.

I have to admit that having watched the film so many times, by the time the DVD came out, I think I was burned out on ""AKIRA"".  So, watching it nearly eight years later on Blu-ray and hearing the audio really bringing the film to life.

It's hard to explain but having watched this film nearly two dozens times, this was the first time that I actually watched  and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I was excited because of how much life the TrueHD audio brought into the animation.  Just sitting down and hearing the taiko drums, the motorcycles revving, the people talking and to hear the overall soundtrack, it made a big difference for me watching it now than any of those times watching it before.

I was amazed by the vibrancy of the colors of the film, but I admit that I was waiting for the dust and the scratches and to my surprise, there were none.  They cleaned this film up pretty good.  So, aside from the much talked about audio, the video is no slouch either.

Last, I know that the direction of the Blu-ray in terms of going for superior audio quality is exciting for the audiophile but for those who want the special features that were featured on the DVD or fans of the original Streamline dub have a valid argument for them wanting inclusion of those features.  Personally, I love releases that managed to include as many features as possible but in this case, having something unprecedented for a film and getting superior audio quality, it may not matter to casual viewers/listeners but I totally agree with the Japanese reviewers, this new audio makes a big difference when you view this film on Blu-ray.

So, superior audio quality versus older special features that probably would be in regular 480p anyway, personally I would rather go with the superior audio quality.  Again, the production report has been offered on VHS and DVD already (and the DVD release of ""AKIRA"" was just too cool to own and by no means will I ever toss that release out).

What has made me even more excited is that the process invested in order to create this 192 kHZ process on ""AKIRA"" can hopefully now be used on other Blu-ray releases.  ""Mobile Suite Gundam"" movies on Blu-ray anyone?  How about those films in 192 kHZ,  24-bit ala Dolby TrueHD.  That would be awesome!

So, ""AKIRA"" has opened up possibilities for Bandai Entertainment and overall, although not loaded with special features, the improved audio and video quality can't be ignored.  Again, ""AKIRA"" belonged on Blu-ray and it's a solid release.

What can I say?  ""AKIRA"" on Blu-ray has definitely made me excited for this film all over again.  An incredible Blu-ray release that is simply a must-own!

================================================================
[THE FUNIMATION 2013 ""AKIRA: 25TH ANNIVERSARY"" BLU-RAY REVIEW]:

VIDEO:

""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  Because it's pretty much the same remastering that was done for the Blu-ray release, not much was done in the actual remastering for the FUNimation release.

My comments for the Bandai 2009 Blu-ray release has not changed in 2013:

The colors for the film remain vibrant, I swear I was noticing background art from the film for the first time and that's considering that I watched this film probably two dozen times already.

Picture quality retains its grain and also there are white specks, so one should know that the picture quality is not pristine.  As for the differences, I felt that the Bandai version had a bit of DNR used because the FUNimation tend to have a bit more grain.

 AUDIO:

The audio is the same as the Bandai 2009 Blu-ray release with one exception, in addition to the Pioneer 2001 English dub, the original 1988 Streamline dub is now included.  So, for those who complained about the original English dub not being included, FUNimation's ""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"" brings it back.

This is what I wrote back in 2009 in regards to the ""Akira"" lossless soundtrack:

Being audiophiles themselves, the full capacity of the Blu-ray disc was used for the audio. ""AKIRA"" is the first film on Blu-ray that is released in 192 kHz/24-bit in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sound. The highest level of sound quality attainable right now on contemporary media.

CD's are sampled in 44.1 kHz and reproduces at 20 kHz. This Blu-ray is sampled in 192 kHz and reproduces at 96 kHz. CD's are 16-bit, this Blu-ray Disc, the audio is 24-bit. The original soundtrack of ""AKIRA"" was originally recorded as a master tape that contained frequencies up to 100 kHz and so, with Blu-ray technology, this soundtrack on the Blu-ray is how the composer intended for people to listen to it.

With that being said, the audio of ""AKIRA"" is just phenomenal.  From the music and the taiko drums, the the various sound effects of the motorcycles to the crowds that are protesting.  The film just comes alive with this soundtrack on Blu-ray and really, was floored by the outstanding quality.

With that being said, the 2013 FUNimation ""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"" features the 2001 the Japanese soundtrack in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (192 kHz), the English dub 2001 soundtrack in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (96 kHz) which is an improvement over the Bandai Blu-ray release which was 48 kHz  and the 1988 Streamline English dub in Dolby Digital 2.0 in 96 kHz.

With that being said, the audio of ""AKIRA"" is just phenomenal. From the music and the taiko drums, the the various sound effects of the motorcycles to the crowds that are protesting. The film just comes alive with this soundtrack on Blu-ray and really, was floored by the outstanding quality. There is a noticeable difference for audiophiles when it comes to the Japanese lossless soundtrack and the English soundtrack in terms of clarity but the English version also adds a bit more sound effects as well.

For example, the helicopter scene in 16:30.  You can hear the clarity of the Japanese lossless soundtrack but on the English soundtrack, you hear a bit more in terms of other sounds and the way the audio moves from one surround channel to the other.

And for those who have badly wanted the old school Streamline dub on Blu-ray, fortunately the ""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"" now includes it!

For those wanting the original Japanese LPCM soundtrack that was on the Bandai Blu-ray release, this is not included in the FUNimation 2013 Blu-ray release.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  Akira Sound Clip (1988) - (19:21) The following is the 1988 Akira Soundclip by Geinoh Yamashiro Gumi featuring optional English narration.  Featuring ""Music for Akira"", ""Kaneda's Theme"", ""Exodus"", ""Ethnic Meets Hi-Tech"", ""Awakening"", ""Mutation"" and ""Requiem"".
  Director Interview - (29:10) The original director's interview featurette with Katsuhiro Otomo.
  Storyboard Collection - (30:57) Featuring a storyboard collection accompanied by the music from the ""Akira"" soundtrack.
  The Writing on the Wall - A translation on the graffiti featured throughout the film.
  Restoring Akira - (11:00) Featuring a featurette on ""restoring Akira"" in regards to picture, English voice over and English 5.1 audio mix taken from the original 2001 DVD release.
  Original Trailers - (3:11) The original Japanese theatrical trailers for ""Akira"".
  Original Commercials - (1:22) The original Japanese commercials for ""Akira"".
  U.S. Trailer - (:55) The 2013 trailer for ""Akira: 25th Anniversary"".
  Glossary - Glossary of terms (in text) featured in ""Akira"".

EXTRAS:

""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

While those who own the 2009 Bandai Blu-ray release may not see a need to upgrade to this ""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"", those wanting a version with the original 1988 Streamline English dub and Japanese special features will want to purchase this FUNimation version.  Also, there is a slight difference when it comes to the picture quality as the Bandai version appeared to use a bit of DNR and the FUNimation version tends to have more grain.  The other difference is audio as the 2001 English dub receives a 96 kHz version as opposed to the Bandai 48 kHz version.

Overall, FUNimation's Blu-ray release of ""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"" is an upgrade over its 2009 Blu-ray release.  For videophiles who dislike DNR, the FUNimation release has the train, for those wanting the 1988 Streamline Dub, the FUNimation Blu-ray release has that and a 96 kHz version of the 2001 English Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  The Bandai release has a booklet, slipcase and an LPCM soundtrack of ""Akira"" and some may prefer the version with DNR.  And this release also includes both Blu-ray and DVD versions of the film as well.

So, I do feel that FUNimation Blu-ray of ""Akira"" is an improvement over the 2009 Bandai Blu-ray release in content, PQ and AQ.  Unfortunately, the 48-minute ""Akira Production Report"" was not included on this Blu-ray release, which is a little disappointing as I was hoping it would be included on the 25th anniversary release.  So, for those who own the Pioneer 2001 DVD release, you'll still want to keep that one in your collection.

But for anyone who is an anime fan and a fan of ""Akira"", FUNimation's 2013 Blu-ray release of ""Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition"" is an improvement over the 2009 Bandai Blu-ray release and is definitely recommended!",1234396800,366,15180,4.899647197177577
626617,5,6303305520,"Having read the complete manga by Katsuhiro Otomo gives you a jump start on the film itself. The film keeps up to it, even though it crops the latter half of the manga... They would have had to do almost six hours of footage.

Nonetheless, Akira is one of the greatest animated feature films of all times. Not quite a fan of american dub in general, but the original japanese version leaves a masterful testimony, that the film is painstakingly meticulous and detailed; that you could swear that the words are really coming out of the characters' mouth.

Having seen four versions of the film (Mexican Spanish, Castilian Spanish, English and Japanese), I'd have to say that this version is all worth it, even when spanish speakers like myself are used to the Mexican dub. Akira is worth all the way, in all the languages.",1233532800,,821,4.655172413793103
626618,5,6303305520,"WOW, just WOW..... the HD transfer of this 80's animated movie is unreal. story is still relivant and the art is unlike anything ever produced. cant say enough about this. A+++!!!!",1233273600,,180,4.838709677419355
626679,4,6303305520,"REVIEW: Despite the fact that Japanese cartoons had gained a small foothold in the American market (i.e. ""SPEED RACER"", ""BATTLE OF THE PLANETS/GATCHAMAN"", etc.): it wasn't until the advent of this film that the floodgates were opened, and the anime genre became a force to be reckoned with here in the United States. The reason why is perfectly clear from the first few minutes of ""AKIRA"": as this is quite simply one of the best looking animated flicks ever crafted. The stunning backdrops; non-stop action; and apocalyptic, blood-and-guts mayhem made for a very different cinematic experience that most western viewers had no idea existed. The story begins in ""Neo-Tokyo"" thirty-one years after World War III has turned Japan into a raging hell-hole fueled by political corruption, military crackdown, student uprisings, failed demonstrations, anti-government terrorist groups, rampant crime, and rival biker gangs (or in the words of the Colonel in the film: a ""garbage heap made up of hedonistic fools""). By accident one of these biker gangs (led by a jovial punk name Kaneda) stumbles upon a covert government operation when their friend Tetsuo is kidnapped and forced to become the latest guinea pig in a scientific experiment that seeks to enhance an individual's psychic powers (so they can be used as a tool for the powers that be). Unfortunately for everyone concerned: their latest ""test subject"" IS this out-of-control, put-upon teenager who ignites a wave of destruction against his old enemies, his friends who were always treating him like a ""little kid"", and the government who messed with his mind and turned him into a ""freak"". ""AKIRA"" can be a very difficult film to watch: not just because of the wall-to-wall violence (although not the bloodiest anime: it does have its nauseating moments of gore), but because the plot takes a couple of viewings before the audience can really get a handle on all its complexities. The film also suffers a bit simply because there are so few really likeable characters (although Kaneda and his buddies turn out to be more heroic than their gang-banging/violent behavior anticipates, and the efforts of the revolutionaries Kei and Ryu are certainly commendable in the face of such overwhelming evil); but the dark, downbeat nature of its story may (oddly enough) be more ""realistic"" in its depiction of apocalyptic doom than most end-of-the-world pot-boilers. With intimations of an anti-Christ, political corruption run amok, and destruction on a widespread scale: this could almost be read as a Japanese/eastern take on the book of ""REVELATION"" (albeit with no second coming of Christ, no happy ending, and no thousand years reign of peace).",1231718400,,2697,5.1880733944954125
626680,5,6303305520,"This movie is a must-see for any anime fan. It's as simple as that. The makers of Akira were ahead of their time. Akira inspired and influenced many other films. It's the movie that brought anime to the US. It is a wonderful classic. However, I will say, if you have read the print version, expect changes as you would any time a story's format changes. Even if some viewers end up disliking it, Akira is a film all anime fans should experience.",1231200000,,445,4.373493975903615

I was very anxious to watch it, but found it to be anything but what the reviews said.  I have chalked it up to one of those films that is a classic because everybody says it is because everybody says it is because everybody says it is...",1228521600,3,432,4.2560975609756095
626682,2,6303305520,"I'll make it short; there is no reason to fully restate the contents of this, as it's available from countless other authors and places.

*SPOILER WARNING*

I read the original comic (in Danish, though, and later in English), and in watching the Anime adaptation, I got severely disappointed. Yes, I know that you can never make a perfectly 'honest' translation of something from one form of media to another, but still, I had my hopes set for something more than this.

One part of it is the way the plot and storyline of the print version is torn apart and odd stuff that seems out of place is inserted in the animated version instead. Fx. (probably the most noticable difference, in retrospect) why is Akira reduced from a living being to a collection of formaldehyde specimen jars? Why has the foreign intervention been erased (the US Aircraft carrier in Japanse waters). Why is Lady Miyako changed from a withdrawn and insightful person to what appears a religious lunatic cult leader (i for some reason, found this insulting!)? Why was the Post-Nuke Neo-Tokyo cult following around Akira/Tetsuo toned down to the point of annihalation?

Too much of the good stuff that gave essence to the comic has been ripped out, and it shows.

Sitting back and seeing the movie end, and the scrolltext enter the screen, I felt robbed. I expected more than this. (Sure, it's an open ending, but you can surely make open-ended movies much better and more telling than this!).

Even though this classic is obviously praised by many of the old-timers, I wouldn't recommend watching it if you haven't already. (If you haven't read the print version, you may like it better that I have, but on the other hand, if you go ahead and read it afterwards....). I also expect to get a few flames directed at me too, judging from other responses to critical reviews on this board. Oh well. :I",1225152000,,1871,4.723926380368098
626683,5,6303305520,"It really is unbelievable just how many animes derived and used something from this movie.  Obvious origins can be compared to Dragon Ball and Elfen Lied, but so many ideas were first featured in this film that later translated into full-length anime series.  Aside from setting the groundwork for future animes, this film was also one of the greatest, if not the greatest, anime film ever made (though my favorite is still Spirited Away).
The best aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the character development of Kaneda and Tetsuo, best friends in the film.  While Kaneda evolves into a more empathatic person, Tetsuo makes the most dramatic changes, from a jealous and weak individual, to an insane, angry, blood thirsty villian, to a frightened child who clearly realizes his mistakes.  Tetsuo has to be my personal favorite villian from any film, purely due to how well he is developed and the absolute human, kind-natured side to him that is apparent throughout the film.
Besides that, the movie is the orgin of anime for most anime fans, and is an absolute must-see film for anyone in my opinion, even for those who don't usually like anime.  I mean, who doesn't like an awesome story line, great character developemnt, big explosions with high intensity sequences, and a great ending in my opinion.  One of the greatest anime films ever made, and the film that really started it all for anime's popularity.",1220054400,,1416,4.854771784232365
626684,4,6303305520,"Akira in many ways put Anime on the map, at least in the US, but is deserves to be recognized as more than a gateway film into the world of Anime. It is the classic post-apocalyptic setting, a story about what happens when science and teenage hormones run amuck. The film tells the story of a teenage motorcycle gang, and their troubled, latent psychic and second in command Tetsuo. It is an examination of diverse psychology, The Will To Power, corruption in various forms, and ultimately, sacrifice. The artistry of the animation is still amazing almost twenty years later, and the story is just as compelling now as it was then.",1219536000,,631,4.693693693693693

626686,4,6303305520,"In the years since Akira was first unleashed, a lot has changed in anime - and movies in general, animated or not.  Animation has become more sophisticated, voice acting has gotten much better and I think Akira is a big reason why (along with the likes of Ghost In The Shell and Armitage III).

I picked this up a couple years ago, and was mostly happy with my purchase.  It sill looks as good as I remember, and the option to translate some of the grafitti and signs is nice for gaijin like me.  However, I'm not as fond of the new English dub.  While I don't remember the original dialogue line for line, this isn't the same.  Some of the voices sound *off* and I'm pretty sure some of the dialogue was changed.

I consider myself a fan of anime, not a fanatic.  I'm not familiar hundreds of titles, I don't know everyone's name and I don't worship everything that comes out of Japan.  I guess that's part of why I prefer dubs over subs.  Even with the best translations, you don't get the full meaning unless you're familiar with the original language, in which case you don't need to be using the subtitles anyway.  With the right voice actors and the proper way of translation and localizing the dialogue (and other things, if needed), you can convey the exact same thing, even if it's not a 100% accurate, word for word translation.  Subtitles can't do much beyond tell you what the person is saying; they can't tell you how they're saying it, what they're stressing, stuff like that.  Some things don't translate very well, and changing them to something that makes sense in the subtitles doesn't always work; you need something more, which English voice acting has a much better chance of doing.

But that's just a matter of personal opinion.  The English dub is the only thing I find flawed with this release.  Of course, the movie itself has issues of its own - namely the rushed feeling that the end that seems as though the Akira Committee started to run out of steam.  Some may point out that this doesn't tell the whole story that the manga version does or remain faithful to every detail in it, but that shouldn't stop you from seeing this movie.

20 years later, Akira is still a must see if you're into anime that's not of the non-sensical sort.  And even if you're not into anime, it should still be worth a watch or two.  Just go into this with an open mind and be prepared to see or hear something new each time.

Sure, it may not be the best anime ever, but it's still up there as one of the best around.  Top 10 material, even.",1215561600,,2549,4.401709401709402
626687,1,6303305520,"When I first saw this in the early '90s, I thought, ""What a load of over-rated technotrash.""  I thought the underlying plot about a government conspiracy of psychics, a dystopian future, and some kid getting messed up on pills before turning into a giant tentacle machine was retarded.

And I was right.  I rented the movie again, about a decade later, wondering if perspective would change my mind.  Nope.  It's still a bad film.  Sure, it's pretty and all, what with the awesome motorcycle and...  Uh...  Damn, that and the giant psychoturd at the end are really the only two visuals to come out of the film, aren't they?

Man, this thing's horrible.  Just don't even bother with this hot mess.  Instead, here are some useful things you could do with your money: go buy some Uniball 207 medium point gel pens and draw your own hentai; pick up the first two volumes of ""100 Bullets"" and get hooked; ""Sea Monsters"" for the Wii; light some cigars with some Lincolns.

*Loads of fantastic action.
*Fair (but notable) amounts of bloody violence.
*Despite the age, the animation quality is good.  Backgrounds are extremely detailed and artistic.  Video remastery has made the colors very vivid.
*Art design is great.  Even though the characters look a little weird, they are memorable.  Above all, the city stands out and the bikes are cool.
*Interesting story.  It's actually very thick with politics and far-out ideas, and may come across as convoluted at first.  It's good, because it keeps you thinking (could be bad too, because it may be confusing).
*Some deep themes to think about (about society and humanity, for example).  Lots of fascinating ideas.
*Interesting cast of characters, which are fairly well-developed.
*Although die-hard fans may prefer the original 1988 dubbing, I believe that the new English dubbing on this disc is great.  The voices match the characters better (Kaneda no longer sounds like a sufer dude), it's not as goofy (the General no longer growls all the time), and some phrases sound better.
*Bizzare (but good) music.

The Bad Things
*Even with the new English dubbing, some of the dialogue is goofy or corny.  Some of it is laughable (could also be a good thing, because it's fun and memorable).
*The two main characters like to scream at each other a lot (""Tetsuo!!!!!"" ""Kaneda!!!!!!!"").  It's kind of funny.
*As noted above, plotline can be confusing.
*Storyline is shortened for the film format, and is therefore different from the manga (albiet the movie is a good adaptation anyway; both the comic and the film were made by the same man).

It is easy to see why this film stands out as one of the most essential anime films ever made; it is to anime what ""Star Wars"" was to live-action movies.  It is loaded with innovative action scenes; most of them still blow me away.  It is fast, furious, and completely unrestricted.  Above all, it has exceptional quality in all respects (art, story-telling, music, sound, etc).  The story may be hard to follow in some spots, and the characters may not be as well-developed as in other films (like ""The Ninja Scroll"" or ""Berserk"").  Still, it is wildly entertaining and somewhat thought-provoking.  I highly reccomend this film to anybody who is even remotely interested in anime (and doesn't mind seeing some blood).

It is English dubbed (the new 2001 dubbing, not the old 1988 dubbing), but I am sure that it also includes the original Japanese dubbing with English subtitles.

Disc one includes a cool subtitles track that translates background graffitti.  Disc two includes shed-loads of still image galleries (something like 4,000 images!).  It also has a few feauturettes and the trailer.",1208304000,,2725,4.995565410199556

For those of you who were hoping to find the ""Original English"" dub, its not provided on the Special Edition, contrary to some false info I have read on forums claiming it is.

626721,5,6303305520,"Akira is frequently cited as the best Magna of all time. This is probably due to the barrage on the senses that lasts for well over 60 minutes in the second half of the movie which is a non-stop smash down of Neo-Tokyo done in the style of the day of reckoning.

The story revolves around the mysterious Akira, which gives people special powers so dangerous that they can basically nuke buildings by thought alone.

The film takes place in Neo-Tokyo where the government is using the military to shutdown a revolution that is taking place of the streets. Biker gangs cause chaos and are involved in constant reprisals. One gang of teens finds themselves becoming embroiled in a conspiracy involving a scientific experiment of a magnitude that threatens civilization as we know it.

Not everybody is a fan of Akira the first time round but some of this movie's most ardent supporters found themselves suddenly taken aback by it only after subsequent viewings. Akira grows on you, and over the decades remains a classic example of how Manga changed all action movies forever.

I am a huge fan of the original Akira that Orion made back in the early 90's, but this re-master BS has no place on the market. They complete change the dialog and voices that most other fans loved it made the movie, but the thing that really makes me angry is the fact that the pronunciation of names was completely off, Its not Canada its Kanada with a K. Plus the famous bike everyone loves was destroyed by changing all the stickers no I'm not so keen on it. I pawned my special edition Akira that cost me almost $50 when it first came out on DVD I wish I would of rented it first... sigh... If your thinking about buying just flush your head down a toilet you get the same effect as you would with the re-master Akira DVD or you can spend a lot of money and find the original made by orion but be warned its not a DVD its a VHS.... btw the quality was much better on the VHS than the DVD sad really is.",1197417600,8,1354,4.590909090909091
626726,3,6303305520,"This classic anime film was released in 1988 and became a landmark in the genre.  For its time, the animation was highly advanced.  It was also one of the few productions done in Japan at the time using prescoring.

This is a story that takes place in Neo Tokyo in 1988 (a new Tokyo that was built after Tokyo was destroyed by a mysterious explosion).  In the course of this anime you see biker gangs and mutated children with precognitive abilities.  And for good measure, there is a corrupt government and terrorist insurgents trying to destabilize the government.

The story itself is interesting, but yet it is also on the strange side and a bit confusing.  Ultimately, while this film is an anime classic, this is a film I probably wouldn't really give repeat viewings to.",1195084800,2,777,4.669117647058823

Being and anime fan, I realize that this is still a movie worth seeing, because the technical aspects are breathtaking, but those people that are not fans of genre, will likely be extremely disappointed.

The story combines motorcycle gangs, mind experiments, corrupt politicians, secret organizations, an immense power that if it is not kept in check may cause havoc, and a couple of interesting characters. The main problem is that the logic and flow of the story quickly go astray, and we are left grasping at straws to keep our interest while we admire the perfect drawings and unbelievable action scenes.

626791,5,6303305520,"Akira (Katsuhiro Otomo, 1988)

It's impossible to pick one American animated film as archetypal. While Disney reigned supreme as the king of the Western animated feature for decades, choosing a single Disney film as archetypal is just impossible. Dumbo over Cinderella, or Sleeping Beauty over Pinocchio? Heresy, I tell you. (Or you could take Jonathan Rosenbaum's way out and include shorts like ""Hellzapoppin'"", which actually would merit some consideration.) It is not nearly as difficult with Eastern animation: there is Akira, and there is everything else. I watched it again last night for the first time in a few years, and as always, it was an entirely new experience.

I heard it opined once that while Akira is often bandied about as the greatest piece of anime ever made, it's an awful movie to start watching anime with (I believe the term the chap used was ""advanced anime""). This is absolutely the case. Akira is not only violent, chaotic, and relatively confusing visually, it also sports a labyrinthine plot and, if the discrepancies between the subtitles and the dubbing are anything to go by (I don't know nearly enough Japanese yet to be able to translate more than a word here and there), a pretty bad job in translation. (There are whole threads on OMDB spent doing nothing but dissecting silliness in some of the translations. They're fun to read.) That said, once a person has a grounding in anime with more straightforward films by, say, Miyazaki, Takahata, and Kawajiri (and it would also be nice to get some sort of grounding in Japanese culture that can be read between the lines of fantastic live-action Japanese films made by directors like Ozu, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Miike, and the nation's other greats), Akira is an absolute must-see, and one you should probably return to multiple times as you get older, so you notice more.

About the shortest plot synopsis I can give you is this: Kaneda (voiced in the English version by Cam Clarke) and Tetsuo (Stanley Gurd) are members of a motorcycle gang in 21st-century Neo-Tokyo, a small subsection of the city rebuilt after World War III. As the two of the, and other members of the gang, are embroiled in a battle with another gang, Tetsuo, driving at full speed across a bridge, is involved in an accident involving an odd-looking grey child. The government, of whom the grey kid is a ward, come to claim him, and take Tetsuo off with them as well. Kaneda attempts to rescue Tetsuo with the help of his new girlfriend Kaori (Barbara Goodson), while Tetsuo tries to survive the experiments to which the secret government agency that kidnapped him is subjecting him. As well, Tetsuo finds that his mind is being invaded by Akira, and he has to find out who Akira is in order to save his sanity.

This is only the tip of the iceberg. Subplots and tangents abound; there's easily enough material here to double the films two-hour-plus running time, and that's the movie's biggest drawback: Otomo is trying to pack the whole run of his manga into one movie. Because of this, the film demands repeated viewings; you'll only get the tip of the iceberg the first time you see it.  This is in no way to suggest, however, that Akira is not worth the time you will put into those repeated viewings, for it certainly is. The best description of it I've ever heard actually doesn't come from film criticism; Dan Rather, filtered through The Evolution Control Committee, once talked of a ""wild and woolly semi-automatic truck bomb,"" and that's as good a description of this two-hour smack in the face as any. The film has two paces, fast and breakneck. Its violence level ranges from the uncomfortable to the unconscionable, and the only time its plot is not almost impossibly complex is in the first five minutes. It commands you to pay attention to it in the same way a gruesome car accident does. And, like that car accident, once you have caught a glimpse, it is impossible to look away. (I know this is true in my case. The first time I saw a piece of it was in an industrial club. Once I saw it, I spent the entire evening on a barstool staring at the screen and ignoring everyone else I was there with.) Whether it makes any sense to you the first time around may not even matter; images from it will stay with you long after you've finished watching. They'll draw you back.

Not a perfect film, but pretty darned close. **** ",1190332800,2,4396,4.701298701298701

""Akira"" has been hailed as a watershed in the history of anime.  I don't know enough about the genre to evaluate it on that level, but I can certainly testify to its power as spectacle.  Though made in 1988 using traditional animation techniques, it equals or surpasses anything made today, including the current plethora of CGI productions.  The images and backgrounds are detailed, the movements are smooth, and the story is apocalyptic enough to provide a suitable foundation for such incredible visuals.  The script is mostly successful as well, but the resolution that I so eagerly anticipated turned out to be incomprehensible metaphysical gobblety-gook.

626794,1,6303305520,"Akira: Most certainly NOT the most superbly overrated, pseudo-philosophical brain fart, piece of garbage to ever be splattered on the screen.

So, I watched this movie and at first I didn't like it, but then I talked to fans of the movie and I was informed that it was not only impossible to dislike this film, but it was also practically criminal. Phew! I was this close to writing about how this was an incomprehensible jumble of idiotic nonsense with poorly developed characters whose actions seem to be decided more by dumb luck and lousy writing rather than genuine character development. Now, however, I've been informed that I'm not allowed to dislike this film; thanks Akira fans!

From the very beginning of this excellent movie, things start off strong and never let up. There's this intellectually deep and thought provoking scene wherein the characters are riding around on motorcycles and beating people up. This is obviously social commentary on modern obsession with celebrities. Suddenly, government officials kidnap a biker named Tetsuo and give him telekinetic powers, all for reasons I'm sure are just too advanced for me to grasp. Tetsuo breaks out of the secret government facility very easily because that makes perfect sense and is a very smart way to advance the plot. Once free he seeks out his biker gang friends, who are all so nondescript as to be interchangeable which symbolizes how the youth of today wear strange clothes.

 After a few scenes of bike races, violent schools, attempted rape, and Tetsuo hallucinating himself tearing his gut out in graphic and therefore good detail, Tetsuo passes out and is picked up by the government who conveniently happened to be passing by.  Then comes the sublime artistic maneuver of having elderly looking kids attack Tetsuo with giant teddy bears that bleed milk. Tetsuo realizes the full extent of his new powers, learns of the being called Akira who caused massive destruction years ago. Tetsuo follows the logical course of action and decides to go on a random killing spree while tracking down this Akira with a motivation so deep that it isn't even present in the movie. Which I believe to be a form of commentary on the Rorschach inkblot test.

The last portion of the film is every bit as poignant and moving as the first, which is to say very, very much so. Tetsuo continues his rampage across the city  killing all his friends in the process, save one. This one remaining friend then resolves to kill Tetsuo, he picks up a laser gun off of one of the soldiers who died fighting Tetsuo and despite the fact that he has no formal training and is not a professional soldier he manages to survive encounter after encounter after encounter with Tetsuo whereas whole armies were swept aside by the unstoppable youth. The realism and dramatic tension of these battle scenes surpass any work by such two-bit hacks as Shakespeare and Hemingway, additionally they are also numerous and satisfying, comprising what must be at least a third of the film. This movie, unlike weaker degenerate movies made by the pig dogs at Disney, has not just one or two climaxes, but has several climactic moments which have been stacked one on top of the other making it seem as if the movie was twice as long as it actually was. Remember, you can never have too much of a good thing!

Some hippies think Tetsuo is Jesus or something and then get killed by him with no explanation. Phenomenal!

The enigmatic titular character Akira turns out to be dead. Sensational!

Tetsuo transforms into a giant meatloaf for no appreciable reason. Mind-blowing!

A giant ball of light appears out of nowhere and sucks in Meatloaf Tetsuo. Stupendous!

The few cast members left standing survey the carnage and nonchalantly comment on how they think Tetsuo isn't really dead as if it's a good thing. Amazing!

The camera flies through a tunnel of light and Tetsuo says ""I am Tetsuo!""  from off screen. Unbelievable, fantastic, exceptional, splendid, vivid, exciting, magnificent, wonderful, spectacular, outstanding, and it's good too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Akira is most certainly not one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and it is entirely plausible that people like this film because it was good and not just because they are pressured into it or it was the first anime they ever saw. In fact, I did not find it such a terrible unwatchable piece of crap that I hold it in the same regard as Read or Die: The Movie, another excellent film!!!!!!!

Know this: when this anime hit theaters (yes, it was on a limited run), I can't imagine anybody but the underground really knowing what they were getting into. In the States, animation was either Disney/ Looney Tunes or those old, badly dubbed Speed Racer cartoons. ""Akira"" changed all of that. Decades later, the film still holds up against your average Adult Swim anime. Its adult themes, gloriously colored animation and haunting soundtrack still inspire awe. Admittedly, the story gets a bit confusing - but pay attention to the amoeba. This one'll leave you screaming ""Tetsuoooooooo!"" and wanting more.",1184889600,,664,5.214953271028038

The attention to detail and painfully meticulous artwork on this film holds a special place in the realm of anime and in my heart, especially in the context of when it was created. I was handed this DVD as a passing ""la-dee-da you should watch this it's really good and trippy zomg"" and didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised and very very very confused by the story. I had to watch it more than once to completely understand what was going on exactly, but after the second time it dawned on me that this was truly something special. Not only are the visuals stunning, but the story is complex and wonderfully laden with philosophical nuance. The movie covers about the first volume of the Akira manga. (Which is why it is so confusing in the first place; it only covers a fraction of the story!) I strongly advise reading the comic books at some point before (or after) viewing the film as it will prove to be a good read and a crucial supplment to Otomo's story.",1179014400,,1135,4.514563106796117

626798,5,6303305520,"It is 2019, 31 years after World War III, and the citizens of Neo Tokyo are plagued by crime, gangs, and terrorists. A teenager named Kaneda is the leader of his own motorcycle gang, and weakling member Tetsuo is one of his closest friends. On what seems like a typical night for the group, they find themselves in a high-speed battle with rival gang ""The Clowns,"" but the night takes a frightening turn when they cross paths with a powerful, mysteriously aged child moments after his adult companion is gunned down in the street. Kaneda and his gang soon find themselves in the hands of the police, and Tetsuo, injured, is taken away by no less than the army. Tetsuo escapes from their clutches with the help of some newfound psychic powers, but when the gang is reunited, it's clear that their old friend is not well. Plagued by pain and hallucinations, not to mention years of frustration from always having to be rescued by Kaneda, Tetsuo is slowly becoming something no one can predict or trust. He is soon recaptured by the military, as Tetsuo has become a very important and dangerous part of the secret Project Akira. Meanwhile, Kaneda has troubles of his own. His attraction to a young girl he met at the police station has led him into the dark underworld of anti-government terrorism. It seems the new paths of Kaneda and Tetsuo are linked, though. When Tetsuo escapes again with thoughts of discovering the mysterious child called ""Akira"" on his mind, Kaneda decides he must try to save his friend once again, before his ever-growing powers completely overtake him.

""Akira"" is one of those films anyone with even the slightest interest in Japanese animation, AKA Anime, has at least heard of. It's widely known as THE ""must see"" Anime film. One need only see the ""Production Report"" (making-of featurette) in this 2-disc Special Edition to understand why. The amount of work and attention to detail put into this animated feature is phenomenal! Katsuhiro tomo explains in the featurette, and in the included interview, all that went into the production of the 1988 film, which is based on his comic series started in 1982. The film is a fascinating and dark tale of post-apocalyptic, urban survival and evolution. While not hard to follow, some details may feel left out here and there (perhaps to be found in the pages of the long running graphic work), and aspects of the ending can be seen as slightly unclear. However, the excellent production values, including the most fluid animation I've seen from Japan and the most widespread on the picture screen, along with Disney style pre-animation voice recording, heart-pounding action and music, excellent performances, and no fear in the violence and gore department, will likely please most viewers to no end! Akira is Anime eye-candy at its best, except for one crucial factor: No gorgeous, big-eyed schoolgirls! Oh, well. This DVD 2-disc Special Edition has so many extras, it's about to explode! In addition to the Production Report and creator/director interview, we get a thorough glossary, an unbelievably huge gallery, sound topic clips and restoration topic clips, and a load of trailers too! This DVD set is on par with and in some ways an improvement over the typical Disney Platinum Edition release of one of their films (and this is coming from a Disney fanatic). I WISH Disney's ""making of"" featurettes were like this one, showing the creators actually working on the film rather than the after-the-fact stuff Disney has been giving us lately. Presented here in widescreen with subtitle, dub, and original language options, and even a capsule info version, ""Akira"" is undoubtedly a must own for fans of Anime, but also for animation and film fans in general. It's not like your typical animated feature, and not even like your typical Anime feature. ""Akira"" is something all film fanatics must experience!",1176336000,2,3884,4.929770992366413
626845,4,6303305520,"Akira was my first anime movie and I've been hooked ever since; I'm always on the look out for good anime flicks.  The version I saw was on VHS, with the original dialog. Had it on tape for a long time, but with the rise of dvd, I went and replaced all my VHS tapes with dvd's, including Akira.  To say that I was disappointed watching it for the first time on dvd and hearing all the new english dialog is an understatement.  All my favorite lines were gone.  Yeah, the new lines kind of help flesh out the story more but man, it just wasn't the same movie I remember.  As far as the story goes, I can see where people get confused with it, but that's what makes the movie interesting to me, trying to figure out whats going on.  It's really not that convaluted as some people would like you to believe.  The government has been doing experiements on people who have superhuman powers.  One of these people, Akira, either by his own choice or through the governments experimenting, turned himself into pure energy and destroyed Tokyo in the process, as seen in the beginning of the film.  Fast forward some years and we see that Neo-Tokyo has arisen from the ashes of the once great city.  The city is in turmoil though, lawlessness is everywhere.  Biker gangs seem to rule the streets, which the main characters are all a part of one.  The government, fighting rebels and amongst itself it seems, is still conducting experiments (specifically the Army), now trying to find someone with the same potential as Akira, in the hopes of controlling this person and harnessing their power.  Enter Tetsuo, who comes into contact with one of the test subjects as they are trying to escape.  The government seizes Tetsuo and is soon doing tests on him.  The tests release Tetsuo's inner abilities (that he must have been born with) but as the powers grow, he slowly loses his sanity and decides to fight back, against everyone.  Eventually, he begins to lose control of the power within him and what follows towards the end of the movie is some of the most amazing and startling scenes ever produced. I don't want to give away any more details about the movie, but its great.  Some say Akira is old, that it's not the classic many consider it, but Akira paved the way, in my opinion, for the anime film in America.  Lots of great animes have come out since Akira, a few that could and can rival Akira in greatness; but none have that epic feel of size and scope like Akira. The animation itself is just as great if not better then ever.  The visuals are still stunning.  Overall though, the special edition is a huge disappointment.  I give it four stars because the movie to me is great, but this new version with the new dialog, as a fan of the original, it's a let down.  I've only watched it twice since buying it, its hard to sit through.  Unless it gets re-released with the original dialog here in the states, I may have to wait a long while before I pop it in, so as to not compare it to the original.  Of course, for anyone that hasn't seen it, the dialog change really shouldn't affect you at all and I hope you will come to love the movie like I do.",1172966400,4,3152,4.394827586206897

For the most part, it seems that whichever version you saw FIRST is the one you like.  This is the movie that got me into anime and it will always be on my top-5 list (with the original dub).  I would give the original 4.5 stars, but this one just didn't work for me.  I watched all the ""behind the scenes"" stuff and I know the new voice actors really put their all into this, but very little sounded genuie to me.  Not only that, but they redubbed the movie in order to make it more similar to the japanese dialogue.  This always leads to problems.  There is one line that really sticks in my head - in the original dub, Kay tells Tetsuo ""You must not abuse the powers you've been given,"" but in the redub she says ""the way in which you are using your powers is not correct.""  Give me a break!  I must admit, however, that the sound and picture quality are immaculate!  The colors are brighter, the darks are deeper, the surround sound is used to its full extent - fantastic!  If they had redone this movie with the original dialogue, I'd give it 6 out of 5 stars easy.  The original version was released in a two DVD special edition in the UK.  If you manage to get one (ebay - $25-30), you'll still need a region free DVD player.  What a pain just to watch a movie I used to love.  I've tried watching the redub a few times, but I usually turn it off after the end of the fight scene where Tetsuo wrecks.

His initial contact with the escaped test subject awoke what was already in him...in all of us. If this is true then we all must carry the same genetic code as the one who created us. When in the holding cell, Kaneda was asked "" we use knowledge & energy to create all types of things. where does all this knowledge & energy come from???"" The main character just happened to evolve to the point where he was using the other 90% of his brain becoming more like the one who created us(GOD?). When his power became fully mature(he could not handle it, before then & up to this point)It took Akira to stop him . When the test subjects said Akira was taking Tetsuo away & ""It's too big for us as we are now"". They meant they were going away to create their own universe. Validated by when the professor actually looked & mentioned that the merging of Akira & Tetsuo's enregies was how the universe was created according to his readings...(BIG BANG THEORY???). So when their universe is created their genetic code,knowledge & energy will be passed down to their creations. Their creations will evolve to the point where they will be using 100% of their brain as well & the cycle would continue. This movie is interesting as it fuses religion & science.

its certainly not a film everyone will like, but like i said before, its probably the most famous, or at least the most talked about anime & it draws upon some interesting concepts of a ""cyberpunk"" future, such as violent street gangs, government conspiracies & corruption, civil war & terrorism all within a dystopian metropolis. i mentioned cyberpunk, assuming that the film had taken much influence from sush early 80s cyberpunk as william gibson's neuromancer(ghost in the shell did so much much more) but particularly blade runner, which is technically considered in the same genre, but is assuredly one of the first masterpiece's to place a lot of the same subject matter in cinema on the map (futuristic, visionary, diverse, dystopian metropolis, humankind clashing with artificial intelligence, the protagonists are often ""low-class"" so to speak).

This is the second movie done by this guy that I've seen, the first being Steamboy and I have to say that if he is considered a great than I won't even bother in the anime genre anymore. I thought I was an anime fan, but this one made me change my mind. I am a Miyazaki fan, not an anime fan. NO MORE NON MIYAZAKI ANIME FOR ME!

Now let's get to the movie itself. I'll break it down into pieces for you.

Story - what story? There's this motor gang, they go out hitting people, and one of them gets hurt and taken to a government lab. There they give him power, how they never say, but they do. After some scenes of spilling his guts and getting attacks by milk stuffed teddy bears the guy escapes and starts killing people and blowing stuff up. He knocks down a bridge, a lot of buildings, blows up a stadium, and even brings down a satellite. He goes looking for Akira, some guy who did something in the past (what is never clear) for some reason and when he finds him turns into a big glob or something. Normally I like strange stories like this one, but please make it have a little bit of sense.

Characters - there are lots of characters, but none of them get much past. Tetshuwa, the guy that turns into a glob thing, is an orphan and was beat up a lot as a kid. He is really a very angry person who takes his frustration out on all those around him when he gets his new powers. Really he's the only character in the whole movie that gets any sort of attention. The characters of Kanada, Kia, and the cornel guy, are never developed. There just . . . there.

Setting - The year is 2015 and something happened in the 80's that did something bad so now Tokyo is a rat hole where bad stuff happens all the time to good and bad people, but then again there aren't that many good people in Japan in 2015 anyway. The city is really a nice piece of work, but I never really know what happened to everything. There was a nuclear war or something that Akira had something to do with, but I would like to KNOW what exactly took place.

Soundtrack - I am spoiled. I own the music to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King/dp/B0000DZEA1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hayao-Miyazaki-Box-Princess-Mononoke-Spirited-Away/dp/B0001XAS7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hayao Miyazaki Box: Princess Mononoke/Spirited Away</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe/dp/B000BCE8QY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>, and dozens of other movies. I have a very high standard for soundtracks. But I have to tell you whoever came up with this soundtrack must have been drunk. There are only a few parts where you can actually take your mind off the confusing story to listen to the music, and every time it is the same thing. People yelling dramatically. It is very annoying.

Ending - umm, what ending? Did you see an ending? Caus I didn't. Call me whatever you want, but I just didn't get it, what ever it was. There's a ball of light, Tetshua gets sucked into it, Akira goes into it, and everything gets destroyed, the end. SOMBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I MISSED. No, really, tell me what i missed. Aparently there's suposed to be some deeper meaning that all the fans of this movie keep talking about, but I didn't see any. I really want to know what the ending was suposed to mean, so if you know, tell me. Please. . .

Well there you have it. I just want to say that if this is the standard for anime than I'm through with the genre. THIS MOVIE IS THAT BAD!!!!! and please people, don't give me a ""not helpfull"" vote just because you disagree. if yuo are able to leave a respecfull coment please do so. thanks.",1167523200,6,4551,5.3924050632911396
626853,5,6303305520,"I have been watching a variety of Anime over the last year or so since I finally got around to trying it out and deciding I like much of it-- ones that I've found to be truly great are RahXephon, BoogiePop Phantom, Gungrave, Cowboy Bebop, Ranma 1/2, FLCL and Evangelion.  Others that kept me entertained but were not  as mind-bending good that I've seen are Argento Soma, Betterman, Crest of the Stars, Inuyasha, El Hazard and 12 Kindoms.  I tend to prefer episodes to movies because I don't have to spend quite as much time focused on the TV-- I'm usually on the computer or doing other things at the same time.  But I've seen the movies Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke both of which were really great.

I was vaguely aware of Akira while getting into Anime, but had the impression that since it wasn't one of the newer bleeding-edge titles that while it's probably good it was not particularly on my ""must see"" list.  However, I finally decided to spring for it here on Amazon, and just finished watching it over the weekend.  The word that comes to mind to best describe the experience is simply ""WOW.""  A real roller-coaster ride unlike anything else I've seen.  It took me by surprise as to how really good it is...  It definately goes in my ""best of"" list, and if I'd realized it was this good I would have gone for it sooner.  I don't want to go into details and spoil the fun, and none of the descriptions I've read did it any justice anyway-- it was a real surprise (not that I expected it to be bad, I just didn't expect to be quite so impressed by it...).

Caveats:  there is a fair amount of violence, including blood & guts, etc., and some things in the ""gross"" category as well, though all relevant to the story.  And a little bit of nudity.  If such things offend then by all means pass it up...",1162771200,4,1826,4.3609467455621305

While one can transfer tivo recordings to a memory stick and watch video on the psp that way, owning a classic like Akira on umd was a must for me.  It's just one those films that can be watched over and over.  On the few occasions the pay cable movie channels do show Akira, it is often dubbed in english ruining the essence of the experience.  You must be able to hear the original japanese voice actors shout ""Kanada!"".  This version does offer english dubbing, so you have it if you want it; but, I think it should heard in japanese with english subtitles.

I think anime is particularlly well suited for viewing on the smaller psp screen, so if you're just wanting to buy a movie you haven't seen before to watch on the go, anime is a great choice and Akira, (a dramatic and explosive thinking woman/man's scifi action adventure), is the best.",1154563200,5,1007,4.268421052631579

Later on, as I began really getting into anime, I began searching for the series and films that I'd seen those lazy afternoons of babysitting. After seeing this film for the first time in over ten years, all I can say is...AWESOME!! This film is full of action, suspense, philisophical thoughts on the very nature of life itself, AND a scene where someone trips out! Who could ask for more?! However, if you are easily offended by animated blood and violence or are under 15 or 16 years of age (mentally) and are extremely impressionable, do not view. I tried to watch this movie with my forty-something-year-old mother once, but the violent sequence at the beginning of the film freaked her out so much that I had to stop the DVD and pop in ""Castle in the Sky"" instead.

626899,5,6303305520,"I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!

Now, on to my review of the Akira Special Edition DVD.

VIDEO (A+): It's difficult to find enough superlatives to describe this anamorphic transfer. The film has been completely remastered and it shows. Who knew a hand-drawn animated film (which is fast approaching its 20th anniversary) could look so impossibly amazing? Colors, details, black levels will blow you away. Flawless!

AUDIO: (A+): It has been said that the audio alone underwent a $1 million dollar restoration and I believe it. A perfect and fitting complement to the outstanding visuals. The music of Akira is so important, and thankfully it is featured in all its glory. Even the music and effects during the menu screens are amazing; I listened for quite some time to the music and sounds of Disc 2's menus! The new DD 5.1 mix and the original Japanese Dolby 2.0 track are both impressive.

FILM (A+): I bought this SE DVD back in high school when it was first released, out of curiousity. I was not (nor am I now) a fan of any sort of anime or manga, but I am now entering my senior year of college and this film and DVD set continue to impress me. Yes, the story/plot is obtuse, and you'll probably have to be in your late teens, at least, to understand and appreciate it. That said, I don't take this film as seriously as some people. Its tone is certainly serious and there is virtually no humor to be found, but by not taking it as seriously as some I mean I don't search for its concrete meaning(s). Ultimately, Akira is what you want it to be. Of course there are the obvious cautionary themes of greed, corruption, and abuse of power and nature, but the end is vague and mysterious and lets you draw your own conclusions. Sure, like many people, I thought to myself ""What the hell?!"" after watching it, but time and thought have lead me to believe that that reaction is the appropriate one. You don't have to overanalyze the movie to enjoy it. It is a work of art in every sense of the word, and historically important, especially in Japanese cinema and the world of animation in general. I would venture to say that is it the most ambitious, impressive, and beautiful animated film in the history of movie-making. And oh the extra features. This special edition is worth every penny; Pioneer spared no expense in restoring and producing this DVD set...it's a true reference standard which will probably never have an equal.",1149984000,9,2900,4.603481624758221
626900,3,6303305520,"Or at least as an option.  That's strange to say considering the original was Japanese, but you know what I mean.  The voices don't have the unique sound each did on the VHS version. Now it's hard to tell who's talking much of the time. It sure looks good and this DTS DVD is the best of the current releases, but I want to hear ""Tetsuooooo!"" screamed like I remember it.",1148428800,11,371,4.211267605633803
626901,5,6303305520,"In most anime, as many fans know, anime has violence, gore and inappropriate images that factor into the film or series, of course, that is why many people like anime. That being said, this movie takes extreme dives off that concept.

For example, from the start of the movie, a biker gang lead by Kaneda, a boy of about seventeen are shooting at each other and trying to ram other bikers into the sides of a highway road. And then there's the abuses the girlfriends of the boys face when the other biker gangs seek revenge. Then the loyalty of the gang kicks in to protect their fellow member's girlfriends.

But the loyalty doesn't last. Kaneda's best friend, Tetsuo is tested on by scientists after being captured by the police for a shoot out. Then Tetsuo is dragged into a series of experiments that melt together his bizzare dreams and reality. And the other patients of the experiments try to kill Tetsuo, only letting loose the worst inside Tetsuo, the jealousy of the strengths of his best friend, Kaneda. Tetsuo acquires a deadly power to blast beams from his hands and body to blow up the whole city, and what's worse, is Tetsuo seeks to strike not only the whole city, but namely, Kaneda.

Akira is one of the first anime films to be released, and master director, Katsuhiro Otomo, who is right at the top with Miyazaki, spins a master tale of friendship and the tests of loyalty. I also reccomend Otomo's ""Steamboy"", another brilliant film with breathtaking art. This film is awesome!",1147305600,,1497,4.662878787878788

626904,5,6303305520,"Now Akira may be twenty years old but it's power has not wavered. This release of the Special Edition is amazingly detailed. I got serious satisfaction with the in depth behind the scenes. Though the behind the scenes material was made at the same time in 1987 it too has been remastered for total clarity. The behind the scenes of the movie alone is over 45 minutes long. The original trailers are all accounted for. There's also a whole section of the behind the scenes DVD just for the restoration of the original film. This is just the second disc.

The first disc is the newly remastered movie with 5.1 THX mastered sound. The sharpened film makes even the most minor of details you couldn't see in the 1980's release clear as day. Watching the DVD release of this movie you won't know it was made in the late 80's.

I can't put how this movie feels in words. However take my word for it, this is worth every penny and every second you watch it. This is in the top ranking of the greatest animated movies of all time. This DVD Special Edition DOES NOT DISSAPPOINT!!",1144108800,3,1070,4.426395939086294
626975,1,6303305520,"I have heard many people say that they like the anime more than the manga because the manga has a confusing ending, but after seeing both the anime and the manga... Well, I have to say that I like the manga better. Sure, the manga did have a confusing ending, but the ending to the Akira movie is even more confusing to me!
Even though both the anime movie and the manga both have confusing endings, I have to say that I prefer the manga because it takes you so much further into the story.
I don't think the movie is as good as the manga, but what more can you expect? They tried to cram 6 volumes of story into a movie that's less than 3 hours long.
Anyway, after seeing this movie and reading the manga, it is my oppinion that it's just not as entertaining.
I would have absolutely loved this movie if they had've based it completely on the book, but since I read the manga first... Well, the story just seems way too rushed when compared to the manga.

Pros: The art work of this movie is very impressive, all of the scenes in this movie were drawn very well, and the action will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Cons: Although some people love the music in this movie, I happen to find it terribly repetitive and highly annoying!
Like many of Otomo's other movies, this movie feels really long while you're watching it.
Even though this movie is under 3 hours long, you'll feel like you've been watching it all day until it comes to the point that you're hoping and waiting for the movie to end!
SPOILER WARNING!!! (IF YOU HAVENT YET SEEN THE MOVIE DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT!)
Towards the end of the movie, Tetsuo discovers that Akira, the one that he's been searching for, is dead. When I saw that part in the movie, right after hearing the Colonal say, ""Akira's been dead for years"" I actually said outloud, ""What the hell?!""
Akira wasn't dead in the manga, and I think that it's really stupid that he died in the movie. Also, at the end of the movie, Akira appears as a sweet lil boy, but in the manga he was one sick twisted little freak! I just don't get why they changed it so much!

If you've already seen the movie then I highly recomend buying the manga! You will be amazed how much further the story goes.

If you've already read the manga and want to see the movie then I recomend that you either rent it or buy the much cheaper VHS before making the decision to buy this DVD.",1142380800,8,2399,4.2428884026258205

626977,4,6303305520,"Does a movie become a masterpiece because it's a great example of genius filmmaking? Or is it simply that it became massively popular and enough people mentioned it that it became a masterpiece by default. Akira, and probably Ghost in the Shell, are usually anime starters for people. Both are visually great, have good characters, and requires a bit of reality leaping since they're about things which are quite in the ""fantastic"" as I say.

Tetsuo and Kaneda are childhood friends who are in a bike gang in Neo Tokyo. While in a bike race/battle with a rival gang(very cool scene btw), Tetsuo gets injured by a discolored young boy with some odd gifts. Tetsuo is then taken to a facility where they experiment on him to awaken psychic abilities. The experiments worked, only one problem: Tetsuo didn't exactly have a good childhood because of being treated like a kid so he decides to attack all those opposed to him and try and find the odd thing known as Akira.

Like I said, this is in the ""fantastic"" realm: we're in 2019, World War 3's happened and we have technology we don't have, not to mention the gifts and things that go into that ""must be believed to be seen"" category. So when you see a kid who can deflect bullets, fly out into space and destroy a bridge, you know you're not dealing with simple physics. So if you're starting to like anime, watch Akira because shows get even stranger than that so if you can watch it and not find it ridiculous, then you'll be okay.

For a near 20 year old film, the animation's quite fluid although one thing bugged me: the character designs. A couple characters literally looked like twins and this isn't a case of the ""x colored color big eyed babe"" syndrome from other shows, they literally look alike. The animation is good though, such as the bike chase, Tetsuo using his powers and probably the strangest freak out scene since Dumbo's pink elephants or Trainspotting's detox.

Akira is one of those kind of films that you really have to pay attention or see it more than once. There's literally people who see it 4 times and are still clueless about certain things, which is where an important debate pops up: is this genius by screenwriters to make us think and discuss the story, or is it simply laziness or sloppyness that they slap whatever and make it come across as being ""arty"". The Evangelion series/movie was accused of this but with Akira it's not quite as abstract but there's parts where you will go ""huh?""

It is a good film with good pacing and some remarkable animation but whether to call it the best anime film ever is highly debatable. The biggest anime? Most likely it is.",1140307200,,2649,4.580168776371308

626979,4,6303305520,"As a member of a Japanese media club, I got the chance to see Akira on DVD.  What I got was something that had, as one character put it, ""absolute energy.""  I was immediately enraptured by the story that unfolds in the dystopian wasteland that is Neo-Tokyo, a city built from the ashes of war.

The story starts when two main characters, Kaneda and Tetsuo, and their biker buddies hunt down the rival ""Clown"" gang.  The musical score that accompanies this scene (and the rest of the movie) wasn't what I expected, but it produced satisfying results.  It left me with the feeling of watching tribes in a jungle instead of gangs in a city.  Anyway, on to the characters.  From what I read from other sources, I expected Kaneda to be this streetwise, street-tough superpunk who can stick it out in the worst situations.  Instead we get this guy who puts on a ""good boy"" act for the cops, gets dragged to school, and wears pink.  Some of the guys and I laughed over how Kaneda's name sounds more like ""Canada"" in the original version.  Marlon Brando he's not, but I'm impressed by how Otomo gives us such a human character, which is the only thing that's familiar in his world.  Tetsuo, Kaneda's childhood friend, yearns to break out of his shadow.  When Tetsuo is captured by the military after an accident, he discovers telekinetic abilities he never knew he had.  And that starts a downward spiral in which Tetsuo transforms from Kaneda's ""little brother"" to an unstable entity.  A threat that only Kaneda, Kei (a revolutionary he saves from prison), and three wrinkly, pale-faced kid psychics can stop.

Though I was still intrigued, the film does have its problems.  First, if I had read the manga, I would go on about how all the characters in the story play more significant roles in the manga than in the movie.  Even the title character gets shortchanged (though there's only so much you can do in 124 minutes).  Otomo just needed to flesh out his characters more.  Second, blood flows like water in this movie.  Are people just easier to kill in the future?  The ending, once I understood it, was deep and meaningful at best.  Overall, Akira was a sweet ride I wouldn't mind taking again.  Had I been able to access the DVD extras, my rating would've been higher.",1136073600,3,2269,4.603491271820449

Many feel that people not familiar with Anime should watch this film first.  That I believe is a bad idea for many reasons: 1)the film is very complex and ambiguous leaving the viewer with more ""what the **** just happened here?"" moments than a newbie would want; 2)lots of gore (which is present in alot of action anime but newbies will confuse this with being a standard of all anime); 3)read point 1 again.  This is not to say that Akira is not a masterpiece.  On the contrary, this is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of anime in history.  Beautiful art, mesmorizing soundtrack/music, believable characters that you care about, mystery, lots of action, lasers :)...what more can you want?

For those who are new to anime, look at some of Hayao Miyazaki's more user friendly pieces like Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away before tackling a monster like Akira.

626983,3,6303305520,"There are probably enough comments on here with 613 reviews at the time of writing that you already know this is a serious tale about the final evolution of man.  Though I will say you have to watch the movie a few times to catch the entire story and piece it all together. This movie is, after all, a digest of an extremely long manga run.  All in all they catch all the key points and bring it together pretty well.  (4 stars for the story and script).

The animation (especially for it's time) is superb.  Many modern anime series don't even hope to touch the visual quality and detail of Akira.  It's on par with Ghost in the Shell, or the recent re-release of Appleseed, with a little fudge factor for technology differences.  (5 stars).

Any anime nut worth his salt watches in the original Japanese.  Unfortunately my wife is not such a nut so I have to watch in English.  I don't recall who got the rights to make the original American/English release back in the late 80's.  Specifically the laser disk release.  Whoever it was called in a cast of serious voice actors and translators that did an astounding job in not only pure voice quality but also translating the story.  They didn't just do a literal translation.  They actually spent some time thinking about the story line and translated in order to provide an intelligent, adult, and coherent script.  As a result the English audio track on the early release was incredible!

Sadly with Pioneer taking the helm, the English audio track on this DVD edition is horrible!  The voice actors are very weak - to the point of being annoying, and much of the dialog is literally translated and comes across as childish.  It's like a bunch of 8th graders were turned loose on the script.

If you like to watch in Japanese the audio gets 5 stars.  If you like to watch in English I give it 1 star.

All in all you're no kind of anime fan if you don't at least see Akira, and most of you Japanese lovin' folks out there will love to own the DVD edtion.  Heck even the English isn't bad if you can tune it out.  I'm just spoiled by the old laser disc release.",1133654400,5,2114,4.391752577319588

I feel this new translation of Akira falls in step with the masses.  While the original version of Akira is one of my all time favourite movies this new signature series leaves much to be desired.  The new transaltion deviates wildly from the original I have on Laserdisc  and in my opinion weakens the story quite a bit.  the voice actors don't seem to have the same energy as the original.  Now I don't speak Japanese but eve the subtitled transaltions is slightly different. I'm not thrilled withit but Like star wars if you want it on DVD it is the only game in town,1131926400,4,791,4.535211267605634
627045,5,6303305520,"Visually Astonishing, Dark and Original is what best describes Katshuiro Otomo's Masterpiece `AKIRA'. Now here is an animated film that is way ahead of his time, the film was released in 1988 even before Disney created computer FX's in their animated features. AKIRA is one of my favorite movies of all time it has beautiful visuals, great animation, an extraordinary story and a stunning soundtrack. I have read the entire AKIRA manga comics and yes it makes the movie that much easier to understand but with the new DVD edition which contains the correct dubbed version that allows the viewer to understand the film a little easier. I first saw AKIRA when I was 17 years old and ever since then I have collected great anime, at first I was confused but yet intrigued and consumed by the plot, I wanted to know what the story was about. Finally after 4 times viewing the film I understood the plot and the message Otomo wanted to deliver in this feature. The story is fascinating it takes place in the future in the city of NEO-TOKYO were citizens live in a constant chaos of an urban revolution, while the youth lives reckless on the dark streets gathering in bike gangs the government proceeds with the so called `akira project'; a mayor step in scientific discovery based on human energy.

AKIRA is a movie about betrayal, love, loyalty, anger, and fiction. For those who do not understand it is a movie about the universe and how us humans connect with it,they say we use about 11% of our brains but what if we were able to use 40% or even 100% of it, what then? And what if some of that percentage was damaged by hate, depression, or anger, this is the case of TETSUO who is the center character of this film. The possibilities are far from anything we can imagine, `AKIRA' provides a fictional possibility that self energy exists within all of us and that is just as delicate as it is powerful.

This is an epic proportion animated feature, the action sequences are creatively amazing, the plot is very intriguing, dark and character driven like no other film. It is one of a kind and even after 14 years we have yet to see anything like it whether is an animated or a feature film.",1130976000,4,2189,4.539240506329114

627047,5,6303305520,"I have a small collection of movies in UMD format, and I try to collect any anime releases that come out in that format. Some of the releases are disappointing. For example, Ghost in the Shell and Ninja Scroll (both Manga releases) have no extra features - no choice of audio track, no subtitles, rudimentary menus, and and overall ""soft"" image quality. Ninja Scroll is also presented in the controversial ""wide screen"" version even though the original film was in a 4:3 aspect ratio. All in all, Manga has given short shrift to the UMD format, bringing out barely adequate releases.

Geneon, on the other hand, has produced superior products in their UMD releases. Akira and Appleseed (both Geneon releases) act and feel like their big brother DVDs. Interesting menus, audio tracks in both the original Japanese and English, and English subtitles. Picture quality is razor sharp, the way it should be for the PSP's superior screen.

The Akira UMD has very good stereo imaging, and a crisp image. If you are a fan of this landmark anime you will be pleased by the excellent presentation that Geneon has given it in the UMD format.",1129334400,18,1130,4.78974358974359

627049,5,6303305520,"Or better yet, my favorite animated film of all time.

I can see how some have problems with the movie. It is extremely violent, and I think the confusing nature of the plot trips some people up.

This movie really makes you THINK, and it doesn't really give you all the answers. I have seen this film a number of times, and I still don't understand everything that happened, and I have read all the mangas too! Doesn't matter. Everything doesn't have to be spelled out to be good. Everything doesn't have to say ""Hey, this is what happened"". I don't mind the ambiguity. And a lot of other people obviously don't either.

For those that say this film is boring...uh, whatever. It has TONS of action. It starts with one of the coolest motorcycle actions scenes I have ever watched. The battles toward the end are exciting and downright brutal. The whole film is extreme. From the vocal performances to actually what is happening in the animation. It's a very intense film.

As for the technicals...the film was made in 1988, and yeah, animation has advanced since then, but the film is still beautifully animated. I have a hard time recalling any cell animated film wiith so much attention to detail than this one. And the music is phenomenal. Tribal drums pounding, and japanese choruses chanting throughout the picture. Wonderful.

This new edition is superb. They have really sharpened up the picture a great deal. There are a few times when the specks of dust show up, but overall it looks great. The new dubbing is VERY welcome. For those who hang onto the Streamline version...I can't understand why. It must be nostalgia. The old translation didn't even make sense to what was happening on the screen. And for a movie that is this complex, having a translation that bad pretty much made the film impenetrable. The only problem I have is that the voices aren't done by top actors, like in Steamboy or the Miyaziki pictures. It's a real shame that one of the shining jewels in animation doesn't have the best treatment in the audio section. Still, it's much better than before. And, there's always the Japanese track, which is great. That's the way I watch it.

At the end of the day, this film is a true masterpiece. It's not for kids at all, and you must be ready to think when you watch it. It's not just some cheap action movie. It's deep and complex, as well as beautiful. That's the reason this film is considered such a classic.

I hope you like it as much as I do.

627050,5,6303305520,Akira is not just an animated movie; it's a work of art and a work of love. It's a feature movie that just happens to be animated. The scope of its story is immense and the philosophical issues actually challenge the audience's intelligence in an age when everything is dumbed down for cheap laughs and comfortable feelings.

627053,4,6303305520,"Well for starters, I have to explain this, Akira was originally released in 1985 and you can really see the dating in the movie. However, this doesn't stop this cult classic from being the amazing anime that it is. For anyone who is into anime, the name Akira should stand clearly in their heads, as it was the first true anime to explode into western civilization. The movie starts off with an introduction to the characters, Kaneda, Tetsuo and the rest of their gang who fall into a fight with the Clown gang, a rival motorcycle gang. The introduction jumps back and forth between the gang war and a man trying to save what looks like a young boy with blue skin. Then the two connect and the story really gets good. Tetsuo has an accident while trying to avoid hitting this blue kid and is taken away by the military for observation. The story revolves around an almost apocalyptic event caused by a child named Akira, after his accident Tetsuo has an incredulous transformation into Akira and becomes hell bent on making Akira a part of him. To say anymore would tell the story of the movie and I couldn't ruin it for anyone who really wants to watch it, however I can say this, for anyone who thinks that they would like to get into anime features, this movie is a gateway to the anime world.
If you like the style and flow of this movie make sure to check out also, Ninja Scroll, Princess Mononoke, and Ghost in the Shell. There are of course several other animes to watch after this but, as said before, Akira is the door to the anime realm.",1126137600,2,1547,4.4125874125874125
627054,4,6303305520,"In recent TIME magazine article movie critic Richard Corliss listed both of Otomo's major movies Steamboy and Akira as among the top five animes available on DVD. My interest in Akira arose from my viewing of his newest movie Steamboy and all I heard about Akira being THE anime movie.

The one thing that stands out about Otomo is his ability to create two movies with 180 degree difference in ambiance that deal with the same underlying issue of the consequences of man trying to invent breakthrough technologies when his fallen state prevents the proper use of this technology and the catastrophic consequences of this failure.

The main plot of Akira, if you can call it that, centers around two members of a biker gang, Kaneda the leader of the gang and the younger brother type figure Tetsuo, that run rampant on the streets of dystopic post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo. Neo-Tokyo borrows heavily from Ridley Scott's vision of LA in Blade Runner with magnificent sky scrapers and neon but on the ground level is a city clearly in chaos with a seedy underbelly. Neo-Tokyo is run by corrupt politicians and is the subject of terrorist attacks from groups claiming to be fighting inequality and poverty caused by some ""tax reform"". The only thing keeping a resemblance of order in Neo-Tokyo is the military lead by Colonel Shikishima who exhibits the militaristic traits of pre-World War II Japan. The only sign of spiritual life in the city is a cult movement proclaiming the current order will be destroyed by the re-appearance of a messiah like figure named Akira. Tetsuo gets involved in an accident when a bizarre blue skin withered child appears. The military swoops in to take the child and Tetsuo away. Tetsuo is sent to a military hospital where his inactive psychic powers are awoken by medical experiments. He meets two other blue skin children who also have psychic powers. These children are analogous to the pre-cogs characters in the Phillip Dick short story adopted by Steven Spielberg in Minority Report.  Tetsuo uses his new power to escape from the hospital and starts to go on a bloody gory rampage through neo-Tokyo acting out on his resentment of life and him playing second fiddle to Kaneda. Kaneda along with the Colonel, the three pre-cog children, and a female terrorist name Kai try to stop Tetsuo before he awakens Akira and destroys Neo-Tokyo. The ending has to be seen to be believed.

Akira has been elevated as a cult classic in the US. Akira is considered the movie that propelled anime to the popularity it currently enjoys in the US. This movie represented a radical departure from the cartoonish TV shows like Speed Racer and Astroboy that were the only exposure Americans had to that time to anime. What propelled Akira's popularity was its kinetic often violent and bloody energy, mind bending plot, dystopic atmosphere, fluid animation, and tackling of metaphysical issue. There are some scenes in Akira that seem to be straight from the mind of a Salvador Dali in its surrealism. One thing to always keep mind is all the action one sees was done using hand drawn animation. Akira's has been a major influence in more mainstream movies, for example the Matrix trilogy.

Otomo's vision of Neo-Tokyo is amazing but after experiencing Ridley Scott's vision of LA I did not have the same sense of awe and curiosity. Almost all the characters in Akira are derivatives of some anti-hero and the high level of disturbing violence and surreal images in this movie taxes you. The experiments that led to Tetsuo becoming a psychic monster and the creation of Akira was an attempt to harness ""the power of god."" I was reminded of Dune where the Bene Gesserit through selective breeding created the Kwisatz Haderach. Otomo spells out in the movie that the energy and knowledge from the moment of creation is genetically hard wired in every living being and this power can be unleashed with the use of science. Such Gnostic type theology is very unnerving to someone raised in a Catholic tradition although I can understand Otomo being Japanese sees nature and divinity much more tightly integrated than someone raised in the Western tradition. Another philosophical statement Otomo was trying to make was the cyclic nature of history with periods of destruction followed by reconstruction and renewal. Once again such a view of history is very different from the linear tradition in the Judeo-Christian West. The main overriding message Otomo delivers is how scientific advancement inevitably falls into the wrong hands sometimes by the scientists themselves who do not consider the ethical impact of what they are doing. The result of this human failure is wonton destruction. Of course, this suspicion of science is seared into the Japanese psyche from the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan. Otomo argues that the only way to avoid the destructive consequences of technological advancement is to retain a child-like innocence. Otomo seems to subscribe to the 60s statement about not trusting anybody over 30.

Does Akira deserve its place as a cult classic? Yes. This is one of the most original animation films in history. Did I find this movie an emotionally pleasing experience? No. My reactions to Akira is analogous to how I feel about modern art. With its kinetic energy and surreal images Akira can be considered a piece of modern art on film. The last time I was back in my hometown in the New York metro area, my mom and I went to the recently re-opened Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). As I walked around the galleries, on an intellectual level I can understand why the pieces displayed are important, how they represent feelings of angst in a world ravaged by two world wars, the elevation of materialism over the spiritual, the subconscious over the rational and how they represent a break with the past. But try as I may, I cannot connect to these pieces and Akira on an emotional level. Maybe you can call me a reactionary but when I experience the fine arts I want to be uplifted or be part of the world envisioned in the art. Otomo's Steamboy in its romanticism and nostalgic Victorian setting does that for me but the violent tormented Neo-Tokyo does not. There is enough angst in today's fast paced world where I have no desire to experience more of it in the fine arts.",1123545600,4,6314,4.852504638218924

By todays standards this film is finally looking old yet, unlike todays animated films this was painstackingly all done by hand and trick freeze film cel photography. Like star wars this film pulled some nice tricks that just made you go wow how the hell did they draw that and make it look just like how it'd be in the real world. Plus this film had some of the best orgional music score unlike a lot of todays animated films which just feature crappy pop hits either from japan or the united states. The very beginning where the bikes are racing through tokyo to the end where kenada leaves our realm the music fits perfectly and moves the story in such a way.... The only thing i've never been able to figure out is why Pioneer felt the origional voice dubbing in english was in need of redubbing?  Some of the new voice characters on the new one are plain flat wrong for the characters.  Also, they changed up the dialoge cause like crappy star wars remakes they felt people didn't totally grab the concept of the film so they dumb it a bit for those who couldn't figure out what was going on... Pick up an old VHS copy and you'll see what i mean.... The only fault i ever thought this film was rather weak on was the middle part of where the captian fights with the city council members on what to do with Akira and the situation that was spiriling out of control. It's rather weak for what it was trying to show and a little bit too wordy with no substance.....Course for how this went down in the graphic novels and how big it was it's rather hard to press it all into a 2hr film without some content being lost...

Like Nausicaa and the valley of the wind was a 1980s movie, but it took place in a fantasy world so It didn't look old. but this movie takes place in the city so it looks too crappy. Let me explain what I mean. Ok those little kids with the blue skin look like something from a 1980 animated show like thundercats or something. It's not the anime I know and love. just look at the anime in Neon Genesis or Elfen Lied. It's bright and the girls are hot and it just looks plain cool! but this animation looks retarded in my oppinion. like come on the girl in this movie, Kai, looks like a guy. There is just something I can't stand. like how the main character has a big picture of a capsule on the back of his jacket. like why would you wear something like that?? Is he like 3 years old?? Stuff like that just bugs me to no end. like Tetsuo looked AWESOME with his red cape on and his metal arm, fighting the army. but that was the only thing I liked in the movie. The story also, is very confusing. Neon Genesis is just as confusing but NOT this bad! I am so lost at the end of this movie!  I don't even know why this movie is called anime, it doesn't look like anime. It looks like crappy 1980 american crap animation. Go watch Neon Genesis or Excel Saga or Ghost in the shell or Elfen Lied to see what anime (adult animation) should look like. Not this kiddy looking animation.

Basic storyline, Tetsuo is hurt while trying to prove himself to the gang. The government takes him and does experiments thus releasing his psychic powers. Between Tetsuo's new power, drugs and his own inferiority complex mayhem ensues. This eventually leads to a showdown with Kaneda. I love this movie!!

627118,4,6303305520,"When I first heard friend and the UK press banging on about this movie back in 1994, I thought it was worth a look.

Upon first viewing I did feel slightly confused as it didn't seem to be the whole story as described.  As it turned out the Anime and Manga are totally different animals.

The manga actually does feature Akira in a key role, whereas the film (planned while the manga series was still running in Japan) removes any real direct involvement he has in the story.

Opting instead for the story of Tetsuo Shima.  Telling the tale of his rather awkward angst-ridden teenage rebellion against powers and situations beyond his control.

Chances are, Americans will love the last action-packed 30 minutes with its' guns, mutation, death and mass destruction.

But in my humble opinion the manga presents us with a fully developed world and each of our lead character's individual story arcs are given satisfying conclusions - and so is vastly superior to this over-rated, much hyped piece of Japanese Popular Culture and Animated Action Cinema.  There simply isn't enough time to give Otomo's post-apocalyptic world the time and attention needed to grab an increasingly restless, impatient modern audience.

I was 14 when I first saw the Streamline Pictures dub (still included on the most recent Region 2 UK and Region 4 Australian releases) and it took me several viewings to truly understand all aspects of Otomo's multi-layered film version of Akira.  Over the years my appreciation for this smaller scaled story has increased steadily.  As I matured, so did my tastes in movies.

The Geneon/Pioneer 2001 dub is truer to the original script but totally unnecessary.  Akira is best enjoyed in Japanese with the new Subs.

I actually have three slightly different subbed versions: The Manga/Island World Communications UK VHS, The BBC broadcast version (not too different from the video) and the Pioneer Literal Translation Script of the Japanese (used for the Region 1, 2 & 4 DVD releases).

You really are best revisiting the movie once you have read the Manga.  I guarantee you will come back to the anime version with a deeper understanding of the intricate plot.

To all those who want a throw-away movie experience - go watch a Poke'mon movie instead.

If you can you should Import the Region 2 UK version (available from amazon.co.uk) with the old dub on a second disc with the 4:3 video transfer plus Dolby digital 2.0 Dual Mono (Front Left Channel & Right Channels - no surround sound) or the Madman Entertainment single disc Region 4 version with all 3 audio tracks on the same disc with the 2001 Pioneer Widescreen Re-mastered Version.

The 2 disc American releases have more extras (on the restoration and re-dubbing, plus capsule option - translation of Japanese signs and graffiti) if you like that kind of thing.

Happy viewing!!",1121904000,2,2853,4.916492693110647
627119,5,6303305520,"This ambitious, multi-million dollar animated adaptation of Katsuhiro Otomo's best-selling graphic novel series is spectacular, both on a technical and visceral level.  A lot of effort was obviously put into making the animation as fluid and lively as possible, with stunning results that rivals Disney's finest.  Most Japanese animated films tend to have a somewhat stilted frame rate (for economical reasons), but one look at AKIRA and you would definitely think otherwise.

It is important to note, however, that this is NOT a Disney/family-friendly kind of film.  Neither is it for the squeamish of viewers (or the shallowest of minds, for that matter).  This is a gritty, futuristic, post-apocalyptic tale involving juvenile delinquents, corrupt government politicians, and a cautionary message about the misuse of supernatural powers.  Trying to describe the plotline may be a bit of a challenge, because at times it comes across as convoluted and difficult to follow.  (This can mainly be attributed to the fact that Otomo was trying to compress his 2,000+ page graphic novel into one two-hour film.)  It will take more than one viewing to make any sense out of this labyrinthine story, yet there are cautionary messages that one can ultimately take away from the experience.

AKIRA is obviously not targeted at young children, but at a more mature audience.  Good thing, too, because the film contains an extreme amount of intense violence (and very graphic at that) as well as one brief but very disturbing scene where a female character is almost raped.  The really gruesome stuff occurs in the last thirty minutes in which a young teenager (who happens to be the angst-ridden anti-hero of the story) has his arm amputated by a space satellite (with bloody results), gets a metallic replacement, and transforms into a gross, indistinguishable mass of flesh and gore.  The latter sequence is one of the multiple ""bizarre"" set pieces present in the movie (others which include a nightmare in which cuddly, innocent-looking toys grow to enormous size and threaten a medical patient).  The obviously frightening aspects of such moments will obviously alienate family-friendly audiences, yet at the same time explode with imaginative, grotesque visuals rarely matched in other films (unless you count Hayao Miyazaki's works).

Also worthy of mention is the background music by the Genioh Yamashiro Gumi, an eccentric concoction of percussion, electronics, chimes, and chanting.  Like the movie, it thunders through the speakers with an aggressive, fast-forward pace and bizarre, surreal tones, ranging from energetic to mellow.  It sounds like an unconventional accompaniment to such a movie, but it works.

The film is considered the pinnacle of Japanese animation, yet, as with many of the greatest films of our time, it has had its share of detractors.  In particular, it took me more than one viewing to finally accept AKIRA.  I first saw the movie when I was thirteen, totally unprepared for such a violent, confusing yet beautiful animated movie.  To be honest, I disliked it.  When I saw the movie again five years later, it wasn't the bloodletting or the plot that offended me, but the dubbing (not produced, but released by Streamline Pictures), which grated on my ears and ranks as the worst English Anime dub I ever heard.  (To those of you who are fans of that dub who may be reading this, I'm sorry, but I absolutely can't stand listening to it again.)  But after obtaining this more polished, professional sounding version by Geneon/Pioneer (more on that later), I at last came to accept AKIRA as a remarkable achievement in animation with strong, universal messages resonating within its turbulent, gory nature and multi-layered storyline.  Even so, I wouldn't recommend this movie for the casual fan, but for animation buffs and as an exercise in artistry, action, and morality for adults, few films match AKIRA as a worthy contender in that category.

As for this Special Edition DVD release, I have to tip my hat off to Geneon/Pioneer for putting a lot into remastering (and retranslating) this controversial classic.  The video quality is amazing, but not quite perfect; there are still some specks I could spot on the print, but these are very insignificant considering how gorgeous the print looks.

The biggest improvement, however, has to be the English re-dub. Produced by the folks responsible for top-quality productions for shows such as COWBOY BEBOP and OUTLAW STAR, this new version is superior to the original in every way. The new English cast is talented and give it their all, and their efforts are amply supported by a script which is not only more coherent but faithful in spirit and meaning to the subtitles.  (Using a direct literal translation in a dub can sometimes result disastrously, but this happens to be an exception.)  The only weakness is that the spoken lines do not always mesh with the moving mouth since AKIRA's original Japanese dialogue was, unlike most Anime, recorded BEFORE animation began (hence why the animation is obviously synched more to the Japanese language track).  While this new version may not be perfect, it certainly comes close, and everyone involved obviously cared about this legendary film to do it justice.  The Japanese language track is included on the DVD set as well, but it's in 2.0 and not 5.1.  (Note: A recent re-release has the Japanese track remastered to DTS 5.1.)

It's the special features, however, that make this edition of AKIRA deserve its subtitle. There's absolutely everything you'd want to know about this film -- a ""making-of"" documentary, a 20-minute short on the creation of the music, an interview with Otomo, three excellent featurettes about the remastering process, and a very helpful, informative glossary. There's also a ""capsule feature"", where a capsule appears once in a while on the screen, and you can highlight it to learn even more interesting facts on the film.

Bottom-line:  even if you are a non-fan of this movie, you are invited to check out this DVD release.",1121558400,4,6082,5.096774193548387
627120,1,6303305520,"To begin with, this was suggested to me by 2 friends, both of which praised the story. I read a few online reviews here, thinking it to be an at the very least decent anime. But the truth is, this movie is mostly shock and gore, so I only suggest it if you are a horror film fan. The obscene images, including Tetsuo's gruesome hallucinations like milk-bleeding teddy monsters and tearing open and spilling your small intestine all over the sideway, are far too much for me. Also, I frown upon the post nuclear holocaust setting. You may like it, but I just find stories in that era unbearable.
If you're a member of that party, one who reads the above and thinks ""Awesome, dude, let's go get this!"" then by all means, you and dude can go get it. But if you're a tad more level-headed, I suggest something less, dare I say... mentally puncturing.
I left out one very vital piece of my review. If you read some of the reviews around here, you can piece together a rather odd picture.

It seems that AKIRA is about:
-Violence and attacking anyone who's in your way, as well as those who are not.

Does anyone here who is an AKIRA supporter mention Kaori? Do you even know who she is?
Kaori was Tetsuo's girlfriend, and she suffered severely throughout the movie. The enemy biker gang sexually abused her, Tetsuo didn't even care about her, and often shunned her. And in the final stages of the movie, he killed her. Yes, I know it's a spoiler, I apologize, but it's worth noting ahead of time.
Doesn't that phase you? Did you not see her blood squirt from her like a tomatoe? That was manslaughter, a massacre, an unatoned slaying, pure homicidal garbage. In my opinion, it was perhaps the most--the only emotionally effecting moment in the entire movie, and full worth noting in any review. She's the reason I give this movie only 1 star. It's not my idea of entertainment to watch someone hurt.
...
That's all I have to say.",1120867200,10,1924,4.463068181818182
627121,5,6303305520,"If you think back long enough, there will be a time when there simply was no animation available in the United States from anywhere else in the world.  Everything that was animation was made in the U.S. (Disney, Hanna Barbara).  There had been a few strange animations that had drifted across the Pacific, one of them being the epic ""Robotech"" - a compilation of 3 different animes into one long American show.  Another notable exception was the grand old race car show from Asia called ""Speed Racer.""

These shows had a small, small group of fans who thought they were alright, but when it came to a major animated work one usually thought of Walt Disney (for good reason they make amazing films).  Then, in 1988, something new came across the waters, a new and controversial film called AKIRA.  A reworking of a popular comic book in Japan, this film featured a mind bending plot and a new kind of animation that was vastly different from anything anyone had seen before.  Needless to say its cult status exploded upon its limited run in select theaters.  It made much, much more money stateside than was expected and the response was even more unexpected : they wanted more.  Ever since, anime has been a niche category in the States, a new genre brought forth by AKIRA.

The film itself is a totally original work, there is absolutely nothing like Akira out there.  It is a political drama, a story about racing friends, a science fiction story, it is all these things.  It is very, very unique.  More than anything, though, it was the vastly different style of the film that made it marketable.  Like any killer app, it filled a niche perfectly and then ignited the market for that product.  People were ready for something different and AKIRA delivers in spades.

Disc One:  Akira with full options menu - all dubs / brand new English vocal track with better translation / optional subtitles / THX and Dolby

627122,5,6303305520,"YES this version is different from the original Streamline release.  YES it has different voices and dialogue.  and YES, it IS better for it.  the original translators butchered the script, often with hilarious results, with dialogue that often didn't make any sense, thus rendering the story almost beyond understanding.  don't get me wrong, i will always cherish my original VHS.  that's what got me into anime to begin with.  but the fact is, it was obviously done with serious budget constraints and did not get the care and attention it deserved.

with the new version, however, the team went back to the original script and re-translated the dialogue to more accurately reflect Otomo's vision.  the is clearly documented on the bonus disc.  the story is now more understandable, and the ""wtf?"" bits of dialogue have been replaced with that which makes sense.

an example of this is Kaneda'a original ""just when my coils were reaching the green line"".  this has changed to the more accurate ""just when my motor coils were getting warmed up"".  what was also incorrect in the original is in the scene after the gang is arrested when the man pulls a grenade.  in the original, the gang sounds like they are defending the would-be suicide bomber (""what are you gonna do, hang 'em?"").  what they were actually doing, as is seen in the new release, is berating the man for his stupidity in endangering them all (""next time why don't you just hang yourself!"").

as for those who bash the movie because ""it's not Disney'!!!  you are just morons.  the movie was NEVER intended to be viewed by children.  it is an adult feature film.  the japanese don't just make movies for kids.  animation is the major form of cinematic entertainment in japan.  don't be an ill-informed ignoramous.

all in all, the new release is superior.  again, i will always cherish my VHS, if only for it's blatent campy dialogue and for obvious sentimental reasons.  but for viewing pleasure, it's the new release all the way.",1118534400,2,1997,4.805882352941176

627224,5,6303305520,"Akira the animated film is a different animal from it's original comic book/graphic novel series. The printed series is far superior to this animated one and if you just plop in the DVD you're more than likely going to be confused as to what's happening in the end. Tetsuo's power is so overwhelming that he cannot control it thus it manifests itself in the grotesque flesh mutation we see at the end of the movie. In the books this happens over a long period of time so we know exactly what is happening to him. Akira himself appears in the book series as a little boy but in the film we see him in parts contained in jars of liquid. When you know the difference between what we read and what we see in this film then can we only appreciate what Akira is really about.

I would not recommend this DVD to anyone unless you have read through the paper series and can understand what the whole story is about. If you're just a technical junkie then the animation prowess Otomo presents in this film may be enough to get you to like it.

Overall the series is an absolute must read and the film itself is good but is rather condensed which is what is confusing a lot of the reviewers I have read through.",1117843200,2,1201,4.286343612334802

Ive had it on VHS forever and have watched it frequently until I bought this special edition DVD. Don't get me wrong with the three stars, I love this movie. What bothers me is the characters voices have changed AND the dialoge is different. Not to the point to where the story plot has changed but noticably. I have noticed now that it says in plain english ""new english dialogue"" on the features on the back of the DVD, and if I had noticed that beforehand I wouldn't have bought it. Or who am I kidding; It's Akira, yes I would have just to have the special edition. But I must tell you that when I feel like watching Akira, I pop in the VHS with the original voices and dialogue.

The fellow who was shot by the politician.  He was also part of the Akira terrorist organization?  How come they were laying off bombs?  And why was he tied to the government?  At the same time, why is the general allowing experiments on Tetsuo?  What they are creating is what the terrorists are believing in?  So in essence the government is creating their own enemy?  It still gets me confused.  I like the clean stories like Star Blazers and Macross Saga.

But for what it is, Akira is a great art film.  It really takes on its own life and interpretation of the nuclear age.  Obviously this movie was inspired by the atom bomb.  The entire movie starts with a mushroom cloud.  I highly recommend this film for those who just enjoy art films.

627227,5,6303305520,"Rating:A+
Katsuhiro Otoma is quite possibly one of the greatest writers/artists ever in the field of anime and moviemaking, and Akira shows that even the most epic of ideas can be fully accomplished with devoted time, as well as effort. Though the movie only scratches the surface, of what the comics delve into so much more deeply, the movie itself is not flawed in any aspect, and is truly the epitome of animated movies that not only has withstood the test of time, but still eclipses modern moviemaking as well. Telling the story of a biker gang that is run by the leader Kaneda, as he is accompanied by his friends, most notably Tetsuo, his best friend, who strives throughout the movie to not be treated like an inferior individual, the movie pushes you mind and imagination into areas where your emotions are grabbed from your soul and wrung out like a damp towel. As these two friends are drug through the war that is raging in Neo-Tokyo in a post-apocalyptic world in 2019, after the effects and destruction of World War 3, strong dominant politicians, and government agents emerge to fuel the fire of this amazingly multifaceted storyline.
After an accident on the outskirts of Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo is left in shambles and taken to a hospital, where his friends are unable to get into contact with him. Tetsuo emerges with newfound ""abilities"" that tap into his inner psyche, and show us the true power of the human mind. Saying too much about the story would spoil too much, as truly whether you are a fan of animated movies or not, this is one movie that must be seen to be believed. Friends of mine that bashed this movie for so long, actually sat down and watched it, and came away understanding why myself and others hyped it up so much. Though it might require multiple viewings to truly understand, the emotional afteraffects, of friends torn apart at the seems, can connect with each and every one of us. However, this movie is definitely not aimed at a younger audience, and is highly recommended for mature audiences, even teenagers, who have an open mind and are willing to sit down for two and a half hours, and have their mind twisted and contorted. After walking away from the movie I dare you to say that this movie did not strike an emotional cord, as truly it is and will always remain one of the finest accomplishments in all of moviemaking, period.",1114300800,2,2374,4.641330166270784
627228,5,6303305520,"This was among the first Japanese anime films that I had seen, Warriors of the Wind (aka Naussica), Ninja Skroll, then Akira. These three film got me hooked on anime for life. Who cares what the those critics have to say in these threads... Akira ranks as one of the greatest films in its genre of all time period... like it or not.

When I first saw this film back in 1992, I didn't quite understand all of it myself. But it didn't matter. I was visually stunned by the ground breaking animation, graphics and the detailed set designs. It took a few viewings for me to understand the complex plot. But still...didn't matter.

What gets me most, is that some critics don't even see many of these films, and then give a review.

Two things about a lot of Japanese anime

1. It's not for kids

2. This art form come from a culture that is quite different from our own so why do people keep expecting the same things that the commercialized American system of film making produces is beyond me.

Let us true fans of anime appreciate what this unique form of art and expression has to offer.

And Boo to the Nay-sayers",1113436800,3,1114,4.378640776699029
627229,5,6303305520,"It's tempting to say that there are two kinds of animation - the ones before and the ones after Akira. It's probably better to say that there are two kinds of viewers: the ones who have and the ones who haven't seen it. Even now, more than 15 years after its original release, it still has incredible impact.

All of the pieces are good. The architectural backgrounds are spectacular, and frame the action well. The characters are all well-drawn; the children and some of the adults escape the standardized look of so many anime. The story moves fast, from scenes of gang war and urban burn-out, to underground laboratories, outer space, and a chilling nursery. The battles are well-staged and varied, and the many scenes of destruction are drawn with passion.

The good pieces come together in a story that is much more than its parts. Even the little things, like the strange cultists off on the side, support the movie well.

Lots of other animated moves have come and gone since Akira first came out, and good riddance to most of them. Akira has stood up well in the years since it came out, and still looks good in comparison to newer movies.

627230,2,6303305520,"This was made long before the advent of computer generated animation, and I really miss the old hand drawn animation. It just has so much more character than this new CGI stuff. The story on the other hand didn't quite add up at all. Maybe something is really lost in the translation, but the writing isn't much better than a Godzilla movie. At least a Godzilla film has a campy charm to it. The plot just seems to rest very uneasily upon the dialogue of the characters rather than be integrated into the story. So many of the characters are just making speeches to try make a vain attempt at explaining what's going on. Still, it didn't make any sense. Why were these experiments conducted in the first place? Why is Akira being worshiped as a techno saviour? Why do they await his return when he destroyed the city last time he came? (Come and kill us again Akira) Why continue such experiments? Why did Tetsuo become like the experiments just by coming in contact with one? Why didn't the many other people turn like Tetsuo when so many others were exposed to the same experiment? Ultimately, it's but a movie about a kid going on a murderous rampage that's fueled by his own inadequacy. That might appeal to teens who have fantasized about going postal on their high school, but nobody else. Anyone who gives this movie 5 stars should be committed before they hurt somebody if you ask me.",1109462400,5,1392,4.549800796812749

At that point it just gets wierd and makes no sense. The main character, Tetsuo, turns into a giant mutant bloatsac and they never really explain who the hell Akira is  an how he really relates to the story. Also, Tetsuo's girlfriend has to be the ugliest girl in anime history. If you want to see a classic anime that delves into the human mind, then see Neon Genesis Evangelion. As for human evolution, wait for the upcoming Elfen Lied. I enjoyed both better than Akira.

The image it's clear and the animation good, the only problem are those moments inside of the bubble, when you see images of Tetsuo and his friends, and it's not clear what Akira is and he's the risponsable, of such disaster in 1988.

I didn't know anything about Akira either, I was just bored one saturday night, and my roommate had a copy of it.  I'd heard of it, so I figure maybe I ought to watch it to kill some time till  later on.  I was really blown away, from the first bits of the film on--the opening chase scene is a brilliant hook.  About halfway through, some of my friends went to a bar, but I was way too enthralled to leave.  The animation is very good, way better than I expected, and some of the dream-like visuals are stunning and use the medium very well.  There are some scenes that just couldn't be done without being animated.  The story's pretty interesting, and I don't know if I understand it completely, but it certainly isn't something where you stop watching and have no idea what happened.  It generally makes sense.  I've gotten lots of people who ""hate"" anime to watch this film, and they've all really liked it.  If you're thinking of tiny people with huge heads and HUGE eyes, really small mouths, with a lot of screaming and lazy animation--this movie is nothing like that at all.  Good for anybody.  The only thing that bugs me is the dubbing isn't great (never is), and some of the script is kinda dumb/irritating (like a lot of anime), but that's more a function of the way the young characters are at times portrayed than bad writing I think.  It's definitely a very minor issue.  Oh yeah, and the music rules!!!

627324,5,6303305520,"1. The understandable complaints that this version changed what people grew up with. I disagree, and belive that its an excellent change personally, but I also know the effects of audio are severe on nostalgic memory's.

Seems like the original fan base is suffering more from personal attachment issues than a lack of taste really. Its hard to fall in love with something only to have it changed, even if for the better(or worse ..) Since the rythem of something you have watched will be off just enough to bug you.

In this case I would warn against people who are long time loyal fans, most of these people got the movie by now probably, less hardcore longtime fans who rememmber the movie, and just now wanna re-live it probably won't notice the change.

2. the Second catagory of complaints are the kids that watch anime for all the wrong reasons, Kids with too much of an appitite for mindless action and violence that looks more interesting when being animated, even more dramatic. To say this movie is boring, followed by numerous complaints of not understanding it definitly leads me to belive that this kids watched this movie waiting for some kind of major action sequences.

T^his movie starts of with a mild action bang in the form of a bike sequence, this sort of speed racer sequence comes back later on in the the sewers, and there is a few I'm a super human badass psyche stuff, but the reality is this movie is a much more subtle Sci-fi epic styled movie. With many layers and multiple story line clashes, it build a tapestry of more down to earth stroys about friendship and power struggeles. The ending that most of the kids complain about being long ( or they don't understand ..) Is very spiritual, and is one of my favorite endings ever, in any movie anime- or elsewhere.

One of the reason Akira became what is was . had nothing to do with it bein the first anything. the reason It was such a powerful movie is its abilty to trancend anime. To become something more than an animated movie. Many people who in america actually first viewed this movie with a group of other movies that exploded about the same time thanks mostly to  sci-fi network, and word of mouth of friends. Lots of them watched other anime beforehand, and this is the one that actually stuck with them and really made them understand that it was more than ""cartoons"". I myself Remember seeing the Project Ak-O stuff, and dominion tank police stuff, and at the time was really into Project Ak-O. It was this movie that I always look back at as the definitive anime ""motion picture"".

I still will pull out and watch this DVD first when showing anime to friends that haven't watched much",1106352000,4,2679,4.56875
627325,4,6303305520,"Akira is often lauded as the definitive anime film. It is quite a spectacle to behold, and the movie definitely deserves the hype.

This anime is primarily a cyberpunk morality tale. It is also a brilliant, bleak version of the future that takes viewers on a slick, violent, and mind-bending ride. Akira's philosophical undertones rival those of the Matrix and echo those of 2001: A Space Odyssey.

(Spoilers below)

The story is primarily about a gang of teenager bikers that live in Neo Tokyo, 2019. Akira begins with a brief look into the life of Tetsuo, a 15-year-old underdog who is constantly in need of the help of his friends (the other gang members). His foil is the loud, brash Kaneda, the gang member who drives the now-infamous red motorcycle. Neo Tokyo is in a state of political unrest, and the government is also involved with several experiments that exploit the powers of skilled psychic children. One of these children was Akira, a boy that razed Neo Tokyo over 30 years ago. Tetsuo crashes into one of these psychic children during a motorcycle chase, thus awakening his own latent abilities.

Tetsuo is temporarily kidnapped by the government where his powers are tested and forced into existence. The movie later insinuates that Tetsuo is entering the next stage of humanity; he is an evolved, powerful telepath. However, the movie also alludes to the fact that the government used various techniques to draw out these powers (from the other children, a strange group of withered telepaths) and then exploited them as weapons. Tetsuo himself is a poor candidate to host such abilities, we soon learn, as he begins to lash out at the world that once forced him to be weak.

Akira is about existence, the abuse of power, and the fallible nature of humanity. These themes are addressed under a veneer of fast, violent action and futuristic battles. Although the manga most likely features better characterzation than the movie, Akira is still a moving, worthwhile film. Tetsuo's descent into madness is reminiscent of Gollum's internal battle with the Ring (as portrayed in Peter Jackson's the Lord of the Rings). To compare the two films would be a stretch, but both feature important lessons about absolute power.

For lovers of anime, Akira is an entertaining, beautifully animated film that is sure to please. For fans of science fiction and philosophical movies, Akira will also be a good choice.

Even so, Akira is not perfect. It is dark, violent, and often disturbing. The confusing plot takes several viewings to comprehend fully.

Overall, Akira is a finely executed work that deserves its place in the varied timeline of film and anime history.",1104883200,4,2673,4.950892857142857

First off, the plot is good, but from about the middle on just was, for lack of a better word, wierd. I don't think this should be the first thing people think when they hear the word Anime. The ending is soo strange that I made the decision to not see this again. The characters were also odd.

627328,4,6303305520,"I read the epic manga of Akira first and got this for my birthday. For being an adaptation (even if it was done by the creater), I felt even with the changed parts from the manga, this was good. The dub, like most will agree, sucked; Japanese audio with English Subs is the best to go with most anime (unless it's Inu Yasha, both aren't that good but the Japanese sounds like he has a headcold).

For a synopsis, Old Tokyo is destroyed in 1988 (when the movie came out) and another World War begins with the Soviets and Americans going head-to-head (which we don't see). Tokyo is rebuilt over thirty years in Tokyo Bay on a manmade island where the movie starts (2019). The government is hated in this movie and we'll see anti-governmental members everywhere (including riots and terrorist bombings). Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang which goes around causing mayhem in the streets while fighting their nemesis gang, The Jokers. During their battle, Tetsuo (a friend of Kaneda who is put down often by him) is injuried when a small man walks out onto the road while his bike is driving by. The bike explodes and Tetsuo is taken by military medics to a hospital. Kaneda meets Kei, a member of an anti-government group, at a police questioning. Tetsuo is revealed to be a telekenetic and quickly gains power, seeking the mysterious Akira (who in the manga was actually a boy). During a raid, Kaneda and Kei meet Tetsuo with his new powers, seeing he's turned evil with his newfound powers. After a long and explosive track, Tetsuo reaches Akira to find him dead, only jars of organs (that ticked me off a little, I liked the little boy Akira). Several other psychics revive Akira to suck Tetsuo into another reality where a new universe is born and destroyed, consuming Tetsuo into it.

Changes from the Manga: Otumo takes out all of manga 3, which requires Akira to become a bunch of organs becuase at the end of Number 2, he destroys Neo Tokyo. This destruction and lack of government creates a load of clans and territories, the most known is The Japanese Empire, lead by Emperor Akira. I felt that Manga #3 was needed becuase Kaneda comes into the story as a chauvanist, cursing, antisocial, arrogant, egotistical biker but leaves less chauvanist (at least in my eyes) becuase he develops a romance with Kei, a real tomboy who seems to change his views on girls. In the anime, they only hint at a romance (mostly one sided with Kaneda making really bad pick-up lines or starting conversations that are less-than casual) and Kaneda leaves the same chauvanist, cursing, antisocial, arrogant, egotistical biker he started out as.

Overall-I think the dub and differences in the storyline were a disappointment but the overall movie was great, especially the dub-synch in Japanese (the mouths ACTUALLY move with the words!). Four stars!",1100390400,2,2838,4.7408906882591095

627332,4,6303305520,"Akira is a great movie and always mis-pronounced by Americans, much like the Japanese beer Asahi is mis-pronounced.  Nevertheless, this is not a childrens animated feature.  Yes there is some nudity, but it is not that type of anime.

  The film is a saga, it is long, many people not interested may find it downright boring.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone under 18, mostly because they probably won't enjoy it.

  Much like Blade Runner is often discounted by people the first time they see it, the same often happens to Akira.

  If you enjoy Blade Runner, more like if you downright love Blade Runner, you will understand this movie and enjoy it, despite its 124 minute run time.

  Regarding which version to buy:  Personally I grew up watching the original U.S. release with the original English voices.  Most purists enjoy the old-single disk version much better than the newer special edition.

  I would buy the original version first, then if you fall in love with Akira, it might be worth it to get the newer one.  Remember, DVD has only been around in the U.S. since 1997 and some of these first pressings are already out of print.  That's why I always suggest getting the earliest printing first, because it is more likely to find the later pressings later.

  Akira is a perfect example of this.  The version most Akira fans grew up watching in the U.S. might not be around for that much longer, and it will probably get phased out soon.",1099008000,2,1459,4.623529411764705

I'm really pissed that they would do such a thing. I LIKED the way Koneda's voice sounds when he's yelling at Tetsuo. I liked how twisted Tetsuo's voice becomes throughout the film. I liked the sounds of everyone els'es voice in the movie. why in the hell did they change that??! stupid morons.

It isn't the end-all film or perfect anime it's made out to be. Personally, I found it absolutely pathetic at best. The characters are hardly memorable, with little history and even less depth. The plot is paper thin. The voice acting (in the dubbed version anyways, that's all I've brought myself to watch because this movie was so disappointing.) is awful, everyone sounds much like Steve Erkel with a head cold.

In my humble and personal opinion, this is the worst movie I have wasted two hours on, whether anime or live action, in a long, long time. I recommend renting this movie, or finding a friend with a copy, if you really want to see it. If you do, for some reason, waste the money to purchase it, you may contact me, and I will give you some very fun Martha-Stewartish tips to turn the DVDs into a coaster for your drinks. :)",1094947200,9,999,4.370967741935484

One reason why I love this movie, is the message it delivers to the audience. The message is how pathetic we really are, politics, war, riots, we are pathetic creatures. Another reason I like this film is that it's the first animated movie to question our existence.

I didn't enjoy ""Ghost In The Shell"" as much as ""Akira"" because ""Ghost In The Shell"" tried to give out that same message, but it the message had been shown in ""Akira."" Don't get me wrong I love ""Ghost in the Shell."" I enjoyed the awesome, advanced 3d visual effects, and lot's it references to the Bible. Also the story was good but it was to short. If you see ""Akira"" do not see ""Ghost in the Shell"" unless you're tempted like I was to see both. I like films that give a true message through hard hitting action scenes not just through Bible references. Katsuhiro Otomo is a great director and has made a true animated epic. In fact, forget that it's an animated film; it's one of the greatest films ever made in the last 60 years.",1093996800,,1157,4.483412322274882

Watch it in the original Japanese with subtitles because the American voices sound really corny. It does drag on at times towards the end especially the ""2001 space odyssey"" like acid trip which is a little confusing, but fun to watch. The best scene in the movie is when Tetsou is in the military hospital and the other children pay him a visit. The animation is brilliant, such as a glass cup falling to the floor and Tetsou slipping breaking the glass and cutting his foot on the broken shards. OUCH! I can almost feel it! Yes, The animation is that good. There is also some excellent animation and sound effects in the sewer with the speeder bike like machines.

A month later i go and get my own copy of the movie. This is definetly one of the best anime's i have ever seen.

Akira first takes place in 1980's tokyo when suddenly a strange and eerie explosion occurs without warning. Fast forward to a time that is much closer to our own tokyo is a much different place now run by rival biker gangs. This movie follows the exploits of two friends in a gang Kaneda and Tetsuo. Kaneda being the bossy big brother leader type and Tetsuo is more like the younger brother who never gets his chance in the spotlight. One night however they were chasing a rival gang out on an old highway when suddenly Tetsuo sees a little boy that resembles an old man in his headlights and just before he hits him the kid blows Tetsuo's bike up with him still on it. Kaneda and the others arrive on the scene to aid their friend but suddenly out of nowhere the military swoops in and abducts the strange looking kid and tetsuo as well. Tetsuo unaware of what is going on awakens in a hospital bed and comes to the realization he now has telekinetic powers. Tetsuo breaks out and goes to find Kaneda however after stealing Kaneda's bike he and naive girlfriend kaori are tracked down by the gang he was chasing the night before and ends up getting the crap beat out of him and his girl before kaneda comes to the rescue which makes it apparent that kaneda has been saving Tetsuo's butt since they first met. Suddenly Tetsuo is seized with a terrible headache and starts having dillusions of his guts coming out where he is later recaptured by the military. However as days pass tetsuo's power becomes stronger but so is his insanity and lust for violence. But when things start getting out of control Tetsuo becomes a threat to himself and others and it is finaly revealed who or what akira was. In a city full of lawless street gangs, violent police, corrupt poloticians, doomsday cults,and numerous truth seeking rebel groups can the power of friendship save them? Akira is a violent yet touching story about one boy's search for respect and ultimately ends up worse off in his search for it. It has a somewhat confusing storyline for those who aren't imtelligent enough to understand that this is not a huge gore fest the story has a much darker tone to it than most anime films always keeping you in dread and yet manages to have a little guilty humor as well. With voice actors from trigun and other famous anime voice actors Akira is not a movie to be watched by the feint of heart. It however is an anime classic and a must see for those who wish to see something different other than the little kid stuff like pokemon or yugi oh.

The quality was horrible on the VHS version, so I am really thankful they remastered and redubbed it for the DVD version. The anime itself has a good plot, but tends to be on the creepy and pessimistic side. However, there was one thing that bothered me... the story had a few bits and ends missing. The reason: Akira originated as a manga, so the important details were not transfered onto the movie counterpart. I recommend you read the manga after watching the movie to catch up on some key details, such as... After his accident, Tetsuo was not simply kidnapped by the military and experimented with, as the movie portrays. He took a pill dropped by one of the sick children, so that's why he was taken by the military.

Overall, Akira is a great anime to start a collection with, but be warned, if you can only stomach the light hearted animes, do not purchase this DVD.",1090454400,,1041,4.537234042553192

I saw this movie when it was first released in the US years ago and even today I still fondly recall those flashback scenes of Tetsuo and Kaneda growing up together, best friends always, yet doomed to their tragic conflict.
I'm the kind of fan who always opts to watch anime in the original Japanese with English subtitles. You get more of the intended emotions from the voice actors that way I find.

(At the time an ""art house"" with a wonderfully eclectic playbill, it's since become a first-run movie house, though still one of the most beautiful movie theaters inside you could ever want to see.) Imagine that, all you Akira fans, seeing this film for the very first time on the big screen. When I left the theatre I was literally shaking, and thinking to myself, ""You don't just watch that movie. You inject it into your veins.""

The good news is that this DVD does all the things we want a DVD to do - the picture quality is great, likewise the sound. Unfortunately - for most of us - Akira is a movie that's considerably lessened on the small screen versus seeing it in a theatre. Otomo's obsessive attention to detail, the sheer complexity of the drawings, the larger-than-life horror of much of the imagery, fairly begs for a large canvas to present it at its best. If you have a friend with a true big screen TV with a surround sound system, beg, borrow or steal the opportunity to plug your Akira DVD into it.

Characters show up and you have no idea who they are, where they came from, or why they're in the movie.

 Conclusion: True anime fans will savor every minute of ?Akira?, directed by the legendary Katsuhiro Otomo, relinquishing themselves to the emblematic anime plot. Those, who are familiar with several anime features, but aren?t genre geeks, will marvel at the futuristic animation and get mildly caught up in the convoluted narrative, as well as squirm at the explicit carnage.

It defines animation in the way that ""Watchmen"" defines comic books, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" defines science fiction, or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" defines wuxia, as something to strive for and not quite achieve. It is a watermark.
That's some pretty flowery praise, but ""Akira"" deserves it. Inside this movie is some of the best, most crisp and exiting animation ever captured on film. There are so many stunning moments (the battle with the clowns, the sewer race, Tetsuo's battle with the army, Kaneda's race to save his friend, the background of Neo-Tokyo) backed up with an exceptional soundtrack that blends techno music with traditional Japanese styles. The story line is traditional anime, with an explosive mixture of youth and technology juxtaposed with the traditional need to impose order on chaos. The characters are both righteous and stupid, heroic and annoying, competent and naive. Ah heck, just watch it!

Anyway the version I watch wasn't the Special Edition version but the orginal DVD version that was dubbed onto DVD. I loved the way it started off as far as the plot is concerned but there was no time for character devleopment. However the fight scenes where great as well as the main characters attitude Kenda. He kept the movie going. I could tell that he is a pretty boy in school for the fact that he wears a pink shirt and no one talks about him.
The best scene in the movie in my opinion was the fight between Kenda and Takosi (sp? on both) at the military base.
The ending left me saying WTF, just because of the simple fact was that was the point that I got lost on. Where he turned into a huge monster and Kenda getting sucked in with him is what made the movie loose a few points in my book.

The reason I didn't like that is the characters that get killed in the graphic novels also get killed in the movie including Kaori.

With the Special Edition metal tin, my heart was racing with excitement that Pioneer had delivered me into the next generation of quality for Akira.  Then I caught the great film on a digital projector in Burbank.  I can't describe the anguish that I was feeling.  The English dub from the theatrical release was displaced with a second rate production devoid of passion.
Probably the most heinous omissions from the film: ""Oh no, not that way!"" when one of the Clowns takes an off-ramp and blows up moments later, ""Scumbag!"" as a riot policeman drills a rioter with a tear gas can, ""Do it now!"" the Colonel growls to gain passage into Akira's subzero chamber.  Replaced with absolutely nothing, no dialogue whatsoever.  I found myself screaming at the screen.  What some people don't understand is that the original English dub has become a part of entertainment history.  Samples have been used in many songs and to replace it entirely is tantamount to blasphemy.  I'm sure some Japanese purists feel the same way, but they should not have released Akira with an English dub if they felt so strongly.  ""You neanderthal pile of crap!""  ""Cretan scumbag!""  Such choice dialogue cannot be easily replaced.
Being in the post production business myself, I undertook a project to extract the original dub from the two laserdiscs and then encode the audio into AC-3 tracks over the admittedly good quality of the remastered video.  There were complications, but in the end with the help of a fellow engineer, I prevailed.  It was like magic...DVD remastered video married to the original English dub.

627623,5,6303305520,"Known as the breakthrough anime film that helped the genre reach transpacific shores, and a film that broke Japan's box office records, beating out Return Of The Jedi, Akira spawned many series inspired by it, many of them taking place in nihilstic post-nuclear settings or characters named Tetsuo.
The nihilism of Neo-Tokyo in 2019 is a place wracked by civil disobedience, anti-government terrorists, political paralysis and corruption among the ruling Supreme Council, police crackdown on political dissidents, members of a doomsday cult calling for a purification by fire, and the youth biker gangs consisting of alienated youths.
Tetsuo is a not so significant member of such a gang, only visible because of his friendship with Kaneda, a youth who has sort of been an older brother to him, always helping him out of scrapes and coming to his rescue.  In chasing and beating up members of a rival group of bikers called the Clowns, so-called because of the masks they wear, Tetsuo has an accident and a run-in with a tiny wizened creature, who it turns out is one of three children with psy powers.  Tetsuo is taken to a secret hospital, where he is experimented on by the scientists there.  He breaks free though, his latent psychic powers awakened by his encounter with the child.
The chief government scientist is simultaneously intrigued and fearful of the powerful potential within Tetsuo.  ""Maybe we shouldn't touch that power-the power of God.  But we have to.  We have to touch it and control it.""  However, the colonel, a stern military figure who is more cautious and is protective for the safety of the three psy-powered children, warns the scientist not to be reckless and to have Tetsuo killed if he can't be controlled.  The colonel seems to be the only capable government official portrayed.  He wants stability and he isn't too crazy about what neo-Tokyo is, but he wants to be able to control things without them getting out of hand instead of the politicians in the Council who only bicker among themselves on dwindling budget funds and are only in it to remain in power.
However, there is an underlying resentment and anger within Tetsuo, not only because he is a disaffected youth, but he has been bullied, with Kaneda always coming to his rescue, and that itself turns into resentment against his benefactor.  But there's also an underlying wish to be somebody, marked by the scene where he is poked fun of when he is sitting on Kaneda's powerful red motorbike, whose futuristic design is another hallmark of the movie.  And the pent-up rage and frustration has very destructive repercussions.  Kaneda himself becomes involved with Kei, a female revolutionary whom he manages to save twice and thus thinks they should have a connection.
Many of the themes that pop up in anime come out here.  The opening scene of a brilliant white globe of light engulfing Tokyo in 1988 is a reminder that Japan was the only nation that had an atomic bomb dropped on it.  And the rebuilt Yoyogi Stadium, where the 2020 Olympics is to be held in the movie, is a reminder of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the stadium, symbolizing the renewed Japan that rose from the ashes of WW2.
The devastating scenes of destruction, particularly the havoc wreaked upon neo-Tokyo accomplishes much that a live action film couldn't, but it's the hallucinatory sequences involving giant teddy bears bleeding milk and Tetsuo's final transformation into a hideous pulsating being that are the visual highlights of the film, which can either repulse or fascinate the viewer.
Series like Speed Racer, Tetsuan Atomu (Astro Boy), and Kimba the White Lion may have led the pack in the early days of anime, but Akira was the one that pushed the anime genre into full prominence.",1078617600,2,3759,4.889937106918239

And then, 10 seconds further into the movie, things start to really move. Akira tells an ultimate, if somewhat gruesome, coming of age story, fleshed out with high-speed action, sharp social observations, ethereal moments of great beauty, ethereal moments of great violence, and visceral explorations of psychic overload.
I've seen a number of complaints about the new English translation, and I have to say... so what? Its the new Japanese 5.1 version you should be experiencing. A movie of such inspired intensity should have an audio track to equal it, and after some quick comparisons between the English and Japanese tracks on this DVD, it quickly becomes apparent that the Japanese track is the perfect companion. The English track is tame and sparse, localized largely up front, but with the Japanese track you're in the mix, the environment spacious, the score places the instruments discreetly around you, creating the best version of this movie I've had the pleasure to enjoy.

It says special edition, and as far as I can tell this is the same ""special"" as in special people.  To start with, they draw you in with the selling point that they have translations for all the graphitti on the walls.  They do, however the format they deliver it in is horrendous.  They call it capsule mode, and it is basically a slideshow gallery of every cell that has japanese figures on it with the english translation.  You cannot watch the movie with the translations integrated, you have to watch the slideshow.  On top of that they completely ruined all of the dialogue in the entire movie.  They ""re-translated"" every line to make it more understandable to us americans.  This was a horrible failure.  The lines make the bike gang sound like stupid frat house guys, and generally just take away from the beauty of the film.  Aside from the translation, the voice over actors are completely unsuited to the animation.  All of the characters sound like rich white kids, and almost as an insult they make the corporal have a black mans voice. Like we wouldn't notice that he is not black!  So just save yourself the $40 bucks, and don't buy this dvd.

627778,5,6303305520,"Reading over many of the reviews, it seems that Akira is somewhat of a love/hate sort of movie.  I remember back before even the word 'anime' was known to every highschool kid and his grandmother, there wasn't much a debate on whether or not this movie was any good.  If you had seen it, you loved it.  And you were automatically held in high regard by movie fans for even being aware of its existence.  Many people nowadays don't seem to like this movie yet claim to be absolutely obbsessed with anime.  Mind you, I don't doubt their sincerity, but I have come across far too many 'fans' who assert their status because they ""watch Toonami everyday"".  *sigh*....Akira, in my opinion is the perfect example of what anime was like in the pre-dragonball era.  Most titles were like this.  Grim, violent, and always highly original in its concepts.  With enough cryptic meanings to instigate philisophical debates amongst any group of movie geeks.  Maby it's just nostalgia on my part, but it seems I can pop in this DVD now and enjoy it just as much as I did when I first saw it twelve years ago.  If you haven't seen it yet and you're still unsure about this alledged masterpiece, look at it like this: if you liked Ghost in the Shell, there's a good chance you'll have fun with this.

627779,1,6303305520,"Too make the long story short.  PLEASE think twice before plunking down the money on this SHODDY release of this masterpiece, Akira.
I watched the original English dubbed version released 10 years ago.  The sound effects and dialogue was much superior to this new DVD version.
I do not know if they were trying to cut cost or whether they were worried about the US market not appreciating the intricacies of these sorts of animations.  They have really dumbed down the dialogue and deleted a few lines.  They also changed the voice of a few characters!!!
I really implore potential buyers to stay away from this new copy.  They cut away some dialogues and the sound effects are really noticeably worse than the copy 10 years ago.  This is definitely not a special edition but rather a hurried rerelease due to the new popularity in animation in the Cartoon Network here in the US.
Unfortunately, I doubt anyone can get a hand on this original copy, but I am sure you can still rent it.
If the readers here are confused to how bad this copy is compared to the original, just imagine Godfather or Star Wars but with slightly different dialogues aimed for a younger audience.  It is so sad that this was done to Akira.  I think this is probably the main culprit to the bad reviews here due to people not understanding or appreciating the storyline.
Also for those who watched this movie and stated they were confused by the storyline.  There are a lot of deeper meanings to what is said and done in Akira especially the dialogue about the power of humans in ameoba.  If you watch it enough and pay particular attention to what they say, you will understand what the creator was trying to get at.
This animation is not based purely on shock and awe.  Like many independant movies, the story line is deep and should be appreciated.  You can't expect another straight forward movie like Lion King or Tarzan.  That really kills the main point in Akira.  More importantly I think Akira is aimed more for adults and not for kids, like Disney productions do.  Again, one shouldn't be expecting grade school plotlines.
My last advise is for people to buy the comic book release.  There are only a few volumes as they place 5-6 issues in a book for easier reading.  The story is really good and well drawn.  You can probably appreciate Akira even better there.
However this new DVD release has been horribly altered.  Not even the subtitles do much good as that has been dumbed down as well.",1067126400,25,2479,4.580498866213152
627780,3,6303305520,"First released in 1988 to much acclaim, ""Akira"" is still considered to be a classic among Japanese anime films and might be considered an early example of cyberpunk cinema as well. The film is based on the comic books of the same name by Katsuhiro Otomo, who also directed the film. ""Akira"" depicts a post-apocalyptic Tokyo of 2019 that is plagued with  riots by day and terrorized by teenaged biker gangs at night. Young Tetsuo (voice of Nozomu Sasaki) is injured in a motorcycle accident and whisked away by military police who have arrived at the scene to collect a mysterious child who seems to have caused the accident. While in custody, Tetsuo becomes the subject of experiments which give him telekinetic powers. The leader of his gang and lifelong best friend, Kaneda (voice of Mitsuo Iwata) wants to rescue Tetsuo. And he is not the only one who wants to break into the  compound where Tetsuo is being held. A group of anti-government activists have their own reasons for seeking the powerful subjects of these human experiments.

The animation in ""Akira"" is spectacular. Some of the scenes are breathtaking. I was especially intrigued by the way that the artists imitated the properties of film with animation: I had never seen selective focus animated before. And I loved the way the taillights of the motorcycles leave light trails at night. If you are a big fan of anime, or would like to see some excellent examples of its potential, ""Akira"" is a film you must see. Otherwise, I have reservations about recommending it. Adapting the considerable quantity of material in a serial comic book to feature film length is always difficult, but ""Akira"" does an especially poor job of it. The story is utter chaos. Large parts of it are incoherent. At the film's conclusion, we still have no idea who many of the characters are or why they did what they did, what the film's point was, or if it was supposed to have one. The characters, themselves, are two-dimensional at best. I've seen much more effective characterizations in animated films. And you'll find better writing in most any animated film. So enjoy the animation, but don't expect much from the story. Japanese with English subtitles (a dubbed version is available).",1065052800,22,2235,4.845549738219895

 In my opinion it has never been surpassed in animation, storyline or characters in any anime since, and is far superior to any of the child oriented,overly bright and colourful Disney animations, or cop-out CG movies(ice age,finding nemo,shrek).
Its complex adult storyline deals with such concepts as friendship,jelousy,revenge,corruption,rebellion,underground government testing on children,physic warfare and the fine line between freedom fighting and terrorism.
This is the movie that I show people to introduce people to anime. I first watched it when I was 11 years old and have been watching manga movies ever since.
After watching most anime that is avaliable out of japan I have never found any visuals to match the level of detail in akira.
The huge cityscapes and destruction scenes are quite captivating, and although I have found many other confusing storylines in many anime,I have never found one as intelligent and well-thought-out as Akira.
I feel sorry for all the fools who moan about Akira making no sense, Your ignorance has denied you one of the greatest viewing experiences to date.
I highly recommend the AKIRA SPECIAL EDITION DVD.
The new english dub explains everything a lot more, making the plot even easier to understand.

627870,5,6303305520,"Okay, I have been reading through the reviews here and the main thing that everyone seems to have a problem with (well...besides the movie itself) is the new language track version.  Basically I like the new language track.  I grew up watching both the dubbed version and the old language track and frankly, the dubbed voices seemed to be a far cry from what the original Japanese voices sounded like.  At least the new dub makes the freaky old children sound like children instead of dirty old men.  Now, I will admit that there is a bit of nostalgia associated with the old language track (I do think it is a shame that Pioneer didn't include them both), but the new track is more accurate to the original Japanese and the got rid of all of they God-awful 80's cliches that filled the original dub.
There, I have said my mind about the infamous redub...now on to the actual movie.
The film is more artsy than ""normal"" films (animated and non-animated alike).  There are long periods of character silence where the only thing the viewer can hear is ambient noises, sound effects, and the score.  The plot is also so warped, twisted, and utterly insane that most viewers will have to watch the film several times before they actually figure out what is going on (if they ever figure it out at all).  Basically, the best way that I can think of to describe this movie is to think of a Kubrick film.  Kubrick's films were long, drawn out, and so utterly convoluted and brainy that most people left the theatre (or their couch after watching 2001 in a single sitting) cursing and scratching their heads in dismay.  That is how Akira is too, only Akira has enough ultra-violence and twisted images to keep most testosterone driven males occupied.
Okay, that description doesn't really make much sense.  To be honest, there is no real way to describe Akira besides using terms that you have probably already read here like Great Animation, Great Score, and the infamous The New Dub Job...  As far as the plot goes, it has something to do with special powers being unlocked, friendships, government conspiracies, inner turmoil, love, hate, freaky little wrinkly children, death, violence, and some big inhuman monster (if you watch CNN you will be used to all of that). So all that I can really say is if you like Kubrick movies, you will probably get a kick out of this film.  If you are a hardcore anime fan, you will most likely already own this movie.  If you are a huge fan of the graphic novel, you will think [bad of] this film ...(personally I am a huge fan of them both..but I am just weird like that).  If you like major brainless Hollywood films, you probably shouldn't watch this film because your head will explode.  If you are none of those things...mayb you should try renting Akira before purchasing it.  If your head explodes....you probalby shouldn't buy this movie.",1054252800,2,2878,4.6358267716535435

627872,2,6303305520,"Akira. The title that has introduced oh so many Americans to the world of anime. One of the single most popular anime movies ever, and is renowned to being one of ""the best"". The only thing I have to say is ""WHY?""
Akira is the perfect example of something that should not be an anime movie. Katsushiro Otomo's 2000 page epic of a manga title is supposed to be rich with character development, story, and filled with taut, gripping emotion. This film is not, and while I have never read the Akira manga myself, I can almost guarentee that this film does not do the manga justice.
Akira takes place about 30 years after World War III, where the world is desolate wasteland. Gangs rule the streets, and one of them contains two childhood friends, Kaneda and Tetsuo. Tetsuo is a very typical character, one who is a little wimpier than the rest of the gang. However, Tetsuo also has telepathic powers, and the government seeks them. Tetsuo could be the key to the end of the world, and he doesn't even know it.
Later in the film, Tetsuo's power grows to dangerous levels, and he loses control of them. This is when it would benefit to read the manga in my opinion. The plot gets extremely abstract, and makes little to no sense.
All in all, Akira is a decent film. I would have to rate it about a 5 out of a possible ten. While it has potential as a film, I would have loved it to be a TV series or OVA. While it may be a great manga with a great, profound story, the movie is an unexcusable trainwreck of a story, especially toward the end. Many more films have tried to take the same story as Akira, such as Ghost in the Shell, and succeed, at least to me.",1053129600,6,1654,4.270700636942675

627935,1,6303305520,"I know of no serious anime fan who actually likes this film.  It's mindless eye candy for nasty-tempered fourteen-year olds who haven't seen much anime before. Sadly, there are a lot of people like that out there, which explains the film's popularity.  The plot is an incoherent mess, moving from one visual set-piece to another with emphasis on violence and spectacle and not much else.  I've heard that the original manga on which it is based is better, and that the reason the film makes so little sense is that it takes a multi-volume story and squashes it down into two hours.  From a technical standpoint, the animation is beautiful (it's one of the few anime films to bother with lip sync), but who besides another animator is going to watch a film just to critique its technical quality?  If you want to see some intelligent, lyrical anime films, I'd recommend Wings of Honneamise, Ghost in the Shell, Grave of the Fireflies, or the films of Hayao Miyazaki, especially Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  (I admit, you may want to see Akira just to know what all the drooling fanboys are talking about, but it really is an awful film.)",1051660800,3,1144,4.638613861386139
627936,5,6303305520,"First and foremost I'd like to state that Akira is not the movie to play as a way to kill time with youngters, this movie is far too graphic and violent for the 12 and under crowd. However it is what many people consider to be the best anime movie ever.
Regardless of your or anyone's opinion this IS the movie that started a generation of anime. It was NOT Princess Mononoke (but that WAS a rather good movie nonetheless). The year was 1988 and Tokyo recovering from the devastation that was world war three, was destroyed by a powerful entity named Akira...
A generation later in the depths of the old city of Neo Tokyo rival biker gangs run rampant in the streets. Among these gangs are two childhood friends Kenada and Tetsuo. In a battle with the rival gang the clowns, Tetsuo gets seperated from his friends and comes across a strange boy. The boy is in fact a secret military project and he has latent phsycic abililties. He injures Tetsuo, and afterwards Tetsuo is abducted by the military, he is subjected to tests that give him powers that rival Akira's (who has long since died) now Kenada must stop Tetsuo as he threatens the world and in higher perspectives the entire universe and the very fabric of time.
In short this movie has great animation and characters although it may be hard to understand without subtitles as all anime movies are. The bikes in this movie are simply AWESOME and I definitaly recommend this movie to you.",1050883200,,1444,4.5576923076923075
627937,5,6303305520,"At least until ""Spirited Away"" becomes available on DVD this week there is essentialy a tossup between ""Akira"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" as to which film should serve as the introduction of a neophyte to the wonderful world of anime.  Either film would serve just fine and while I watched ""Mononoke-hime"" first, I would recommend ""Akira"" as the first choice.  However, whichever way you go if this is your first anime film you need to be aware that all of these films set standards that will put most other films in the genre to shame.
Katsuhiro tomo's 1988 masterpiece is a cyperbunk epic about a group of teenage bikers in neo-Tokyo who get caught up in top secret experiments by the government.  But what could be simply a collison between ""The Wild One"" and ""Blade Runner"" becomes much more in tomo's hands.  The notion that the film is ""visually excessive"" is a gross understatement; for those who have tolerated the minimalist animation and recurring film loops of animation on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, ""Akira"" is as far removed from cheap Saturday morning cartoons as you can get.  As far as tomo is concerned even when it comes to the faces in the background crowd, attention must be paid.
The story is a distillation of years of tomo's manga and why those who have actually read all of ""Akira"" books can bemoan that which has been ommitted in the same manner those who loved Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" lamented the David Lynch film, I think those of us who are completely ignorant of tomo's epic can understand and enjoy the film version (due in large measure to a new and improved dub on the DVD).  Obviously there is more depth to the story of ""Akira,"" and many will no doubt be inspired to check out the American reprints of the manga to enjoy the story in its entirety, but tomo has clearly taken pains to craft this ""short"" (124 minute) version for general consumption.
A confrontation between rival biker gangs leads to an encounter with an odd looking child before all of them are whisked away by the military.  We then learn about the legendary Akira, a psychic who destroyed Tokyo a generation earlier with a powerful mind blast.  The government is try to understand and harness the power of these psychics and when they take Tetsuo, one of the bikers, to experiment on at their secret base it is up to Kaneda to rescue his friend (and impress the girl, Kel).  Then Tetsuo not only gains godlike powers but goes insane and the future of everyone and everything is called into question.
Ultimately, ""Akira"" triumphs because the story is as complex as the animation is detailed (160,000 cells).  The characters might be the stereotypical conventions of the genre but tomo brings nuances to all of them, sometimes through nothing more than the look on their face.  ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is my favorite anime, but ""Akira"" is the most impressive I have seen to date.""  Even without Disc 2 in this Special Edition ""Akira"" rates five stars, but the extra material is extremely impressive, bearing witness to tomo's obsession with cramming detail into every single frame (e.g., Hauryki-Ya, the biker's seedy bar hangout).  ""Akira Sound Clip"" looks at the Taiko drum influenced soundtrack by Geinoh Yamashiro Gumi and there are other features, some of which were made for Japanese comic conventions, and most of which are treats for fans of tomo and his film.",1050105600,4,3373,4.75513698630137
627938,4,6303305520,"Don't get me wrong, I *adore* this DVD. The special features are fantastic, including things like a glossary for the vocabulary-challanged, like myself, and an interview with the guy who did the soundtrack (blanking on his name) which gives one a new appreciation for the music of Akira. Like we needed any more proof that it was a masterpiece. I probably would've given this a three, however, if it were just the movie. I saw the movie once about a year ago, and forgot most of it because I didn't understand what was going on half the time. (Although watching it in the middle of the night probably didn't help.) Then a friend handed me the manga (all six of them!) and I devoured them in three days. After that, I watched the movie again, but was somewhat disappointed, as the plotlines are subtly different between the two. But don't let me disuade you! The incredible animation and enthralling music *alone* are worth the buy. Add in the special features, and what is still a pretty damned good anime, dispite the flaws, and I don't think you could get a whole lot better.",1050105600,3,1077,4.585492227979275

The city is so big and the speed of the animation is like nothing I've ever seen before. Otomo who created most of the story explains his process with an hour long interview and an important lesson in doing dynamic storylines and transferring it to a film maker's order.

The dub is good, and features voice talents like Johnny Young-Bosch (Power Rangers, Trigun) and Josh Seth (Digimon, Tokyo Pig, every Saban dub since '98). Pioneer went all out on restoring this. They did a feature on the restoration that shows you how much work went into this. Although the sub is 2.0 only, there's a new disc out in DTS (thank God I have 5.1) Overall, good transfer, good extrras, perfect movie.",1047859200,,705,4.559055118110236
627993,4,6303305520,"I?ll just state up front that I didn?t really understand everything that was going on in Akira.  I understood the basic story, that of Tetsuo trying to find an identity in a motorcycle gang, but when he meets a strange child he has psychic abilities which begin to awake in him.  The animation is fantastic, and it is easy to see why this was one of the first anime to gain mainstream acceptance in America.  I?m just a little confused on the story.  Watching it, there were a lot of moments where I just think, ?What the hell??  The story is easy to follow, but a little difficult to understand.  I?m not sure about the motivations of some of the characters, and very little backstory was given on the characters.  It felt as though I was being led along on a ride, but I didn?t know where I was going and only had a vague idea of how I got there.
With that said, Akira is an anime classic, and any fan of the genre absolutely has to watch this.  Akira has influenced much of modern anime and before Akira, I wouldn?t have imagined that anything animated would contain that level of fairly realistic violence.  This is worth watching, perhaps two or three times to get a chance to better understand the story.",1047859200,3,1210,4.390134529147982

627996,5,6303305520,"It's safe to say that if you love anime, ..., this is by far one of the best anime I've ever seen (one of the first also). I can't tell you enough how warming it is to watch this movie. You run through all kinds of emotions without really realising. I could watch it 50 times more and never get sick of it; and that is exactly why its worth spending money on this disc instead of downloading the movie from the net .... AKIRA is the story of Tetsuo, an insecure young kid who's a member of a young bike gang in futurisitc Tokyo when political unrest and terrorism seems to be everywhere. These youngsters have no real direction in life and Testsuo finds his identity through Keneda, the leader of the group, also a chirpy, likeable and charming young man. Despite these faily simplistic plot elements, AKIRA is an anime that runs alot deeper then you would imagine and challenges you on several different psychological standpoints. Let's just say the story unravels quiet alarmingly to a climactic, enigmatic ending that you will be trying to decipher the rest of your life! One of the most enjoyable facets of AKIRA is the characterisation. Every person seems quite realistic and I guess people can relate to them on some level - mainly Tetsuo and Keneda. The animation is fantastic, if I'm not mistaken, AKIRA was the first of its kind to use cell based animation or something of the sort. The visuals are great for an anime made back then. The voice acting (I've heard it only English) is fantastic which is something you can't say for many anime. On this special edition, you have the option of listening to the original voice acting or the newley dubbed version which sounds much crisper (although I imagine many AKIRA fans will be slightly dissapointed at the new voices). The original voice-audio track seems a bit muffled in comparison to the newer audio but it's still watchable. I would not hesitate to add this to my collection any time. Those who enjoyed watching the Patlabor movies, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell ... etc (basically any anime which challenges your intellect) should love AKIRA, though there are those of you I know who will grumble about not understanding what is going on. Regardless, it's certainly wonderful to watch and I see it's made an impact on more then a few anime's since its release, eg Spriggan....

628088,5,6303305520,"This review is not about the film, so much as this joyous new DVD release.  I first experienced AKIRA around 1991, when the first VHS release came to the U.S.  The film had quite an impact, but I have to admit that it suffered from the plague which do most anime imports: poor transfer, inadequate dubbing, and VERY lackluster translation.  I guarantee, if you had just a little trouble understanding this film on VHS, you weren't alone.  I must have watched my tape about a hundred times and still had questions left unanswered.  Several years after the last time I watched AKIRA, this wonderful DVD release came the U.S.  I bought it for the greatly improved transfer (the colors are vibrant and the aspect ratio restored), but was rewarded with a new stellar translation and voice-over dubbing.  It was like I was seeing AKIRA for the first time.  Suddenly, everything I never understood came clear, and I was really convinced that the characters were children (this time they sounded like children).  I agree that dubbing is unacceptable for live-action films, but I think it works for animation--only if the voice actors are appropriate and the translation accurate.  Japanese is a very different language from English, and I have a feeling that more popular fare like Pokemon and Dragonball Z mean something much different over there.  Such is the same with AKIRA.  If you've only seen the previous VHS version, you've really not seen the film.  As a fan of anime, and AKIRA, I rejoice in this DVD, as I know I have come quite a bit closer to seeing what the animators originally intended.

628089,5,6303305520,"My Storyline Analysis:
Akira has a convoluted plot. In my opinion the storyline voices the author's rendition of the world, society and humanity in his own view. Only watching the story once, and without another run-through, I would say the quintessence of the story is a contradiction or paradox of humanity. We are able to do much good (like the 3-powerful children), but we can also do great harm (the member of the gang dude). In my opinion, the author suggests that we should question our own actions and motives to determine if we are like one of the children or the gang member. This story indirectly is an impetus to one's journey inward. The story ends with a rebirth and the author's optimistic outlook in his final words.
Buy this movie if you want to challenge your acumen and get a different person's perspective on our contemporary world!!!

So first of all, I have to say that people who have read the Akira manga are probably going to get the most out of this.  People coming to the movie first may be more than a little confused.
That's not to say it's not a good movie.  Soundtrack, animation and production are all great, the plot is...interesting at least, and there are some very powerful and dramatic moments.  I would recommend this to anyone who's liked/been intrigued by the manga, and anyone who enjoys anime or dystopian sci-fi drama.  However, I would not recommend it to people who get fed up if the plot is confusing, or people who are easily offended by strong language or violence - Akira is not for kids, I'd say for 14 years and up.

I bought it the day it came out and I was very dissapointed with the new dub. My opinion is that the original was much cooler. The new dub trys to hard to be politically correct. Listen to the way they say Akira. God, I wanna kick in my speakers. Also listen to the stupid accents on the girlfriends voices. They sound cliche or like some fantasy. Quiet, passive, stupid, etc. In the original, they sounded like they were from Brooklyn and it worked really well for the english language. The music, which is really cool and a major part of the film, is my final complaint because it is so faint compared to the original. The voices were mixed to high and you have to keep a close ear open for alot of the memorable and haunting scores.
  Anyway I was lucky to find a copy of the original video in a pawn shop recently and I enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. I didn't watch more than 30 minutes of the disc and I promise I would have accepted a new dub if it'd been done to any acceptable degree. I really think the original english dub done by Streamline Pictures inc. was done that much better and i'm not just saying that to be bitchy. Maybe pioneer should stick to DJ mixers and home audio.
  The picture on the DVD was, well as good as you expect. To bad there's already a D VHS with six times the picture quality of current DVD and an HD DVD is on the way so I hope enough people will complain and maybe Pioneer will include the original soundtrack on one of those formats in the future. As for any review of the story. Find an old one on e-bay. I really believe the soundtrack makes that much difference. This story is not coherent to any passive viewers. They said the new soundtrack was supposed to make the story more clear. Maybe for your mom, but not for me. You must really embrace Akira or it will completely bewilder you and you might want to stick too MIBII or National Lampoons Van Wilder if you can't identify with this genre of film or you don't have the time.

628166,5,6303305520,"Akira is most frequently designated as one of the seminal anime films, like 'Ghost in the Shell,' which have done much to define the potential of the Japanese genre.  By the making of this film, 'Akira' was already as very popular manga (by Katsuhiro Otomo).  Its theme is one that recurs frequently in anime, the good and the bad of human 'evolution.'
Neo Tokyo is Tokyo reborn on the ashes of the devastation of the next world war.  Set in 2019, the city is already large, crowded, and apparently thriving.  Yet, as you look at the details of this superbly animated film, it becomes obvious that something is seriously wrong.  Discontent has fueled a rising level of social violent, motorcycle gangs make war on the streets, and if one listens carefully, one hears rumors about 'Akira, a savior who wields tremendous powers.
Kanada and Tetsuo are bike gangers, friends since childhood.  When a conflict with the clown gang turns ultra-rough, Tetsuo is injured, just as the appearance of a child-like stranger brings the army down on everyone.  Tetsuo is carted off to a secret facility where the 'examinations' trigger the development of mental powers.  Enraged by years of powerlessness, and fury at his captors Tetsuo uses his powers to search for Akira, leaving a massive trail of destruction through Neo Tokyo.
Kanada, the authorities, and a mysterious group of children struggle to prevent the impending apocalypse, but it is clear from the beginning that nothing will be left unchanged in a demonstration of the risks of granting powers to those who are not ready for them
'Akira' is an example of the power of animation, so finely grained that, wherever the eye rests, there is something to consider.  While it still relies on non-stop action to carry it through, the characters, drawn from the dark side of the city are equally vivid.  Typical of anime, the film drops the viewer into a whirlwind with little or no preparation, but I don't really think the plot of the film is particularly hard to understand.

There will be a lot of people out there who are die-hard purists who will disagree but I feel that the subtitled version of Akira just takes away some of the humor and timing of the 'acting'. I would never watch a dubbed live action film but there's no reason to feel guilty about watching anime dubbed in English.
This DVD itself is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen and has quite a few extra features. Sadly tho, none of them are new. In fact the main documentary is from 1988. I wish I got the limited edition when it first came out but...I missed it.",1038700800,5,690,4.2748091603053435

628170,5,6303305520,"Make no mistake. ""Akira"" is the first great anime known in the Western World. Wired Magazine included it in a list they made of the 20 greatest sci-fi movies of all time and you can definitely see why. It was, at the time, not just a great story that made live-action cinema jealous, it also was a milestone in technical merits, merging for the first time the purest Japanese tradition with some western accomplishments in animation. This two-disc edition is also the one you need to get. Finally, with re-mastered sound in THX, you can feel the pure pleasure of just kicking back and listening to that amazing soundtrack. It also has some very good (although old) documentaries about the whole making-of process. The ""glossary"" option is highly recommended for those who are not familiar with the story, and for all of you aspiring animators out there, there are literally tons of sketches and original drawings from the creators. As for the language, I strongly recommend skipping the English-dubbed version, which is very lame. The best option is to hear the movie in the original Japanese soundtrack and putting on some English Subtitles. By the way, how about throwing in some Spanish subtitles as well the next time? I'm seriously thinking about starting a crusade in favor of language diversity for Region 1.
In conclusion, you can't call yourself an anime fan if you haven't seen this one. I'm by no means an expert on the genre, but I certainly know that ""Akira"" is an ineludible reference. As for the edition, it's clearly the best one available. Maybe it could've had more stuff considering the fact that it takes two discs, but the image and sound quality will definitely blow you away. See (and listen) for yourself.",1038355200,,1729,4.824915824915825
628171,3,6303305520,"Plot: Tetsuo, a member of a biker gang in 2019 Neo-Tokyo, meets these children who have psychic abilities which awakens his own psychic and physical powers, but will he be good or be a monster? ""Akira"" is one of the children with psychic abilities who is rarely seen, and who might cause the end of the world.
My thoughts: Weird, just plain weird. The plot is rather hard to follow, but there's cool action sequences, great animation and one very funny scene with a giant teddy bear that I'll never forget. If I was rating based on animation alone it would have 5 stars, but taking into account the whole movie (plot, characters, etc) I can only give it 3. Even so, it's still a must see for anime fans because of the animation and the impact it had on anime.
When I first saw Akira the only other anime I'd seen had been Sailor Moon on weekday morning TV. If you've only seen a few anime shows and they're all like Sailor Moon, I wouldn't recommend Akira as a first step into darker/drama/weird/thinking anime. If you're already into darker/drama/weird/thinking anime then you'd probably love Akira.
Definitely not for anyone under 13, I might go so far as to say 16 and up (it's a bit disturbing).",1037577600,,1199,4.529953917050691

Superhuman powers have seemed to always be a favorite of the japanese.  This movie has it and more.  A wonderful story of friendship, sadness, and a disturbing theme of human experimentation by the government, all to achieve the ""ultimate weapon"" mankind has always been searching for.  In AKIRA, we have no further to look than ourselves for the power to destroy entire cities with a thought.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the english dub version of this movie confuses an already confusing storyline, not to mention the fact that it does tend to drag a little in the middle.  For someone who hasn't read the manga version, this movie can be extremely confusing.  Thankfully, the japanese language mode with english subs helps a little bit with the confusion.

628267,4,6303305520,"Rating this movie was no easy task for me. The animation is one side of it, the story is another. As for the animation, the motorcycle chase at the beginning was breathtaking. And as one watches this movie, one can't help but realize that this movie probably influenced Final Fantasy 7 and (according to my friend) Full Throttle.
 There is lots of other eye-candy throughout the movie--helicopter blades spinning faster and faster, LOTS of explosions and debris. There is a scene that involves a killer Teddy Bear, Rabbit, and Toy Car that is very, uh, weird, but extremely entertaining. And, of course, the very end of the movie. If you like action, you'll see PLENTY of it.
 The story started out good, but once Tetsuo starts going crazy, the story does the same. Dozens of questions rise in your mind. What is going on? But, hey, it looks good, so you keep watching it. When I got to the end, my eyes widened at some of the grande finale visuals, but at the same time my eyebrows raised a hair more as my mind tried to figure out what had gone on.
 Like I mentioned earlier, Akira probably influenced Final Fantasy 7. In fact, I couldn't help but say to myself, ""Hmm, Akira would make one heck of a video game."" Just take a look at these parallels: Akira = JENOVA, both have motorcycle chases in dark, large, banged-up super-cities and the SOL spaceship reminded me of the one in Final Fantasy The Spirits Within.
 Even if you're new to anime like I am, this movie is definitely worth at least a rental. And when you consider that they took a 1,300+ page graphic novel and condensed it into 2 hours, they really did a pretty good job.",1034985600,3,1637,4.483221476510067
628268,5,6303305520,"Katsuhiro Otomo's master piece that is Akira can only be called superb. It is now a cult classic and though many other animes have been released that boast even better animation than it for some reason Akira still tops them off as a better film. Perhaps this is because of the excellant balanceing of many different elements to the film, as well as shear class.
Akira has everything. It has real characters that are thrust from a world that does not want or care about them into a supernatural world of awe and grandeur. Fastly paced action and chase sequences are quickly followed by sci-fi style combat as individuals use their mere thought to rip apart the Neo-Tokyo landscape that is their battle field. As well as this the film also has a well structured story that centres around two biker gang teenagers-one is Tetsuo, a youth that was bullied and ridiculed by others who is then given god-like powers; the other is Kaneda, a well like individual that has acted as a leader and friend to Tetsuo though finds that he must confront and kill the omnipitant force that has become of his friend. What also makes the film is a sombre and some times brooding musical score that leaps with life at one moment and is quiet and mournful the next.
Akira has charcter; class; as well as guts to create a truely epic and original expierinace that will not leave your mind for some time.

I like the movie as a visual tribute to the original manga. Really I'm wanting 4hrs or maybe 3x2hr series to begin doing justice to the original.",1034726400,,466,4.247191011235955
628270,5,6303305520,"When I first bought Akira, it was for three reasons. One was my absolute hatred for most Walt Disney movies, my love for anime, and the fact that I love weirdness. Hearing my close friends talk about a biker gang running over a kid with a face of an old man really appeals to me. So I went out and bought it...
 I didn't dare buy the English dubbed version. Dubbed versions will NEVER give you the ""true""  and ""original""  feel of the movie, so I took the one with subtitles. Watched it, and fell in love WITH EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF IT.
 If there's a flaw in Akira, I didn't see it. The animation was perfectly done, the story line was intense, and...humanity bleeds through every single one of the characters. As tough as Kaneda may be, he still shed tears for Yamagata, another one of his biking friends that the mutilatedTetsuo had killed.  Kei may seem like your average warrior (oops - I meant terrorist)  lady, but she still screams and shows fear. And Tetsuo - at the very brink of his helplessness, he screams for...surprise, surprise, help.
 The story line isn't as confusing as it seems. Reading subtitles and watching it twice will help.
 Another thing to toast about Akira would be the MUSIC! The Akira theme song, is...there's no earthly word to describe it. It's a type I've never heard before. It's neither modern, nor classical, nor New Age, nor tribal....it's almost a rare mixture between heavy metal, techno, choral, tribal...it's very strange, yet at the same time, delightful and exciting to the ear.
 There's lots of blood and gore in this anime - but it's all tastefully done. The blood and gore's there for a purpose - without it, the story wouldn't be complete. It's not just violence and blood for the heck of it...it's there for a reason. But it's still not a family film. The scene where Tetsuo's girlfriend nearly gets raped by one of the Clown bike gang members isn't exactly pretty to watch - and when Akira's power inside Tetsou is revealed - I'm of legal age to watch it, and it scares me. Thankfully, growing up around manga and anime helped me sleep when night came.

628272,5,6303305520,"No, the storyline in Akira does not make much sense.  Akira should not be praised for its storyline because this is not where it really shines.  Where Akira does succeed (and hugely) is in drawing the viewer in and viscerally conveying the sense of chaos and disorder of Neo Tokyo and the characters' lives.  You can litterlly feel the sense of abandoning responisibility and order as you see the events unfolding.
Run down schools, biker gangs, corrupted politicians & police, restless teenagers, rebel dissidents, and lost people looking to cult religions all fuel the fire in Neo Tokyo.
Technically, the awesome city backdrops along with some of the coolest animated action scenes drawn showcase the highest quality of animation.  My jaw just about dropped when I saw what the artists did with smoke and flying projectiles.  The physics in their artistry is beautiful to behold.
The moody music is perfectly suited for the malaise you sense visually.  It is the unspoken guide to the city that is running itself down.
A lot of people enjoy movies but never realize that the real reason behind that enjoyment versus another film that bored them is that the enjoyable movie drew them in and immersed them in the world and moment that the film takes place.

Now.
This, as I said, is a little gripe.  I am currently using a PlayStation 2 for a DVD player.  For the most part, I have no major gripes.  However, I do know that there are a handful of DVDs that don't play well with it.  Sadly, this is one of them.  It works BEST if you use the original drivers (not the ones that come with the Sony DVD remote, which is unfortunate because I'm sure there are a few features I'm missing because of that).  It will play with the original PS2 release drivers (it gets midway through with the DVD remote drivers and stops).  I'm planning to buy another DVD player anyway (probably an all region one), so this will probably be a minor issue....
Now, please do yourself a favor and make sure you get a copy, okay?  You won't be sorry.  The new transfer rocks, the new english dub is WAY better than the last VHS release, and the subtitles are equally as good as the new dub.  Add a host of nifty extras which will inform and entertain (not to mention the A-Z of AKIRA which will probably help clear up any remaining confusion about what just happened after you watch the film), and a nifty (albeit oversized) metal DVD case (OK, the tray's a little tricky, just be careful when removing the discs!), and you have a nice gift for yourself or that someone special.

The ORIGINAL script. I don't know what made the producers of the DVD think they could do a better job of the script or get any better actors. True, the picture and sound quality is far better on the DVD but the acting just lacks the roar realism and naturalism that was present on the original. I've tried and tried to like this DVD as much as the original but really, it's nearly a different film. The script sounds far too tacky and cliched. It's far less intelligent and funny. And the line ""Get it? Goats eat hay? Pretty funny huh?"" is no longer there. And that was just such a good line. Aaaah the hours that I spent shouting that across the class room. But that's another story. I just hope people new to Akira who are watching the DVD before the VHS will only believe me that the VHS version is SO much better. I know the characters in the film are meant to be teenagers but on the DVD they sound far too timid for violent bike-punks.

The fact is I just never found the hook with this film.  There were a lot of individual moments that I enjoyed, but I did not find an appeal in the film as an overall composition.  The motorcycle chases were great, as was the idea of Neo-Tokyo.  However, the characterization was somewhat two dimensional.  I did not find myself really caring too much about many of the characters.  And both the female and male characters mostly looked like boys.
I think if the film had stuck to the motorcycle gang storyline without moving to the mutant children / Akira line it might have held my interest further.  I just found the Akira story line to be too ambiguous and, frankly, corny.
It's not my intention to ""burn"" this film with this review.  I just think anime may not be for me.  The truth is that I don't really care for the animation style all that much.  Based on very slight exposure, I think the genre is given to high action content storylines involving supernatural/fantasy elements that one either loves or doesn't love.

It took me about 2 to 3 times watching it to totally get full grasp of the plot line, but when I did, I was blown away yet again.
It came out on DVD and I was so happy that it was digitaized and the visuals got even better. The voices were a little different but still excellent. I watch the DVD of Akira all the time and it one of my favorie movie's over all time. Definately in my top 3. So to anyone who thinks this movie sucks, give it another try because I have seen Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D, and Ghost in the Shell and only one of them have even come close to Akira, and that is Ghost in the Shell, but, since I am not writiing a review on that movie, let me just say once again, Akira is the King of all Anime movies, and this may be a pipe dream, but maybe a sequel just as good will come out soon.",1028073600,,1106,3.981981981981982

My question is:  Where on earth did all those kids go?  I know some hard core annime fans have their deadset opinions however I still don't quite get the idea.  All I know is that they went away and disapeared.  Is that all?  You know, that sets it up perfectly for a sequel, if there is any Tokoyo left to destroy that is, they certainly banged it up pretty good.
I'm also still confused on who started the nuclear war.  Most people point their fingers towards Akira however I really wonder about that.
And the stuff that could be left out is simple.  The language could've been better.  I'm not a goody two shoes however I expect a little bit of cleanliness in movies.  And the last thing was the scene where the bikers tore that girl's shirt off.  Not needed at all.  I'm glad they took that out in the director's cut.

He comes in contact with a telepathic child. Soon he becomes telepathic too. But he becomes very powerful. As powerful as Akira. But can his body handle that kind of power?",1025395200,,658,4.730434782608696
628488,5,6303305520,"I can't say any more about the movie, since everything good has been said about it.  Yes, there are a few nitpicks, such as a lack of chracterization and the disturbing ""stadium"" scene, but nobody can argue its influence on animation today. I'm simply here to write about the DVD.
The movie features the original Japanese language with opitional subtitles and a new dub done by Animaze.  Although some purists of the original  dub may cry foul, it was out of Pioneer's hands, as they could not get access to the original dub.  Acting in both languages is great - and the THX quality of the new English dub will bring down your house.
The anamorphic transfer is great, as the colors are brighter than before, although one may complain about edge enhancement.  Most probably won't mind it though.
The first disc also features a capsule option that gives the viewer more information while watching the movie.
The second disc is home to a myriad of extras.  It will take one HOURS just to sift through everything included on the second disc.
The Limited Edition Tin box packaging puts the finishing touches on a solid movie.  Must own for any anime fan or DVD fan.",1024704000,,1160,4.6292682926829265
628489,4,6303305520,"Akira.  A classic masterpiece that was many a fan's first introduction to the world of anime.  The setting is Neo-Tokyo,  a city consisting of a masterful blend of glittering sci-fi technology and dark, grimy urban decay.  It's a city that has risen from the ashes of World War 3 as a shining example of progress, but hides a rotting core.  Biker gangs roam dirty streets battling for turf while corrupt politicians hatch new plots in chrome towers.  Revolutionaries fight for change while death cults pray for the end of everything. In the center of all this we find two long time friends who will ultimately decide the fate of the city, Kaneda and Tetsuo.
Kaneda and Tetsuo are gang members who brutally gaurd their turf.  During a battle with a rival gang, Tetsuo runs afoul of an escaped goverment test subject.  Injured badly, he is captured by the military along with the test subject.  It soon becomes apparent that the military has decided he would make an excellant test subject as well.
Meanwhile Kaneda, while searching for clues to Tetsuo's whereabouts, becomes involved with a beautiful revolutionary.  With the help of the revolutionary movement, Kaneda is able to discover where Testuo is and attempt to rescue him.  Much to his dismay he discovers Tetsuo has become a dark and dangerous person who has resented Kaneda for years.
It is from here that the plot and action escalates to levels that shame most Hollywood blockbusters.  This movie has many stories going on at so many levels.  It's a story of a city that has risens from the ashes only to stand ont he brink of destruction again. It's a story of evolution, where mankind has been, what we are now, and where we might go. And it's the very human story of two childhood friends who care deeply for each other yet are caught up in a whirlwind of hate and resenment.
I highly recommend this film to all and I encourage you to attempt to aquire a subtitled version.  The subtitled version of this film tells a MUCH more accurate depiction of ths movie then the dub version, which many found to be confusing do liberaties taking with the plot during recording.",1023753600,2,2131,4.693548387096774

It excelently combins the very personal part (the friendship between Kaneda and Tesuo) with an apocalyptic - end of days - part. Both work perfectly.
It's full of action, suspence, great dialogue and a lot of psychology & philosophy.
It's a story of friendship, loss, sufferring, lonlyness, fear, anger and all the other aspects of human emotions.

628545,5,6303305520,"""Blade Runner"" blew everybody's mind with its stunning visuals and deeply philosophical story of the line between man and machine, creating the sub-genre known commonly as cyberpunk. ""Akira"" stands as not only a testament to the beauty of animation (especially Japanese anime), but also to the expansiveness of the genre ""Blade Runner"" created. But to call ""Akira"" an animated version of ""Blade Runner"" is not only inaccurate, but a serious injustice to the genius of ""Akira."" This special edition DVD captures all the essence of ""Akira,"" giving any fan all he or she could ever want out of the film, and more.
First of all, the movie is as brilliant as ever, if not moreso. The newly restored movie gives brighter color, sharper picture, and thus intensifying the already wild visuals. The picture is better, the sound is better, and the subtitle translation is better (I refuse to watch the new English track though...while I generally hold no malice against dubs, this new version has the English actors using Japanese pronounciations of the names...it just doesn't work in English, even though the actual dialogue is a more accurate translation). The story is as brain-numbing as a university lecture on quantum physics combined with the philosophies of Socrates and Plato, with a little Philip K. Dick thrown in. Katsuhiro Otomo's storytelling is just brilliant! 30 years after a holocaust that went the world into WWIII, Neo-Tokyo stands where Tokyo once stood. A teenage biker, Tetsuo has been abused and mistreated his whole life, and when he has been granted paranormal powers, he lashes out at the world, forcing not only the ones responsible for his psychic plight, but his only friends in the world to stop him in any way they can before he reawakens a mysterious power known as Akira, the force that caused the holocaust 30 years before. Great story full of philosophical truths and possibilities, and the ending is something Stanley Kubrick would be proud of (a la ""2001""). The music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi is amazing, and has to be one of the most diverse world music soundtracks ever produced (see separate review of soundtrack album).
Secondly, the DVD is incredible, chock-full of special features, from the ""Production Report"" documentary, to an interview with Otomo, to image galleries full of production sketches, backgrounds, and the original comic book covers, as well as a soundclip from the soundtrack. It's everything you could want out of a DVD for a film of this magnitude.
This is truly one of the greatest pieces of science-fiction literature and film-making, and I encourage both anime fans and non-anime fans to see it. To see it in any form less than the one presented in this special edition is a crime. See ""Akira!""",1022716800,,2751,4.995642701525054
628546,4,6303305520,"Though Akira falls into the trappings of most anime (some far off crazy plot point that is never explained but is supposed to have a ""deep"" meaning) it doesnt take itself sooooo seriously that it turns into awful mush. Akira handles the mysterious parts of the story in a way that you feel you've gotten enough to understand the goings on, unlike that horrible princess mononoke which some people have the audacity to say is better than Akira. This film is classic because it takes the best of japanese animation without making it too confusing and warped to understand.",1022457600,,570,4.767676767676767
628547,5,6303305520,"Akira is without a doubt one of the all time greatest anime's ever created, and I admit I was skeptical when I heard about this ""new version"" (the original version of Akira was the second anime I ever saw, the first was Vampire Hunter D).  First off, I will say that the animation is still superb, especially now that the picture has been remastered; the Blade Runner-esque city and buildings jump off the screen, and you will notice more detail than you did in the original version.  However, the new dubbing job doesn't completely fix the convulted plot (it does a bit though), and the ending still leaves something to be desired.  Also, the new voice actors don't quite fit with the characters the way the original voice actors did in the original film.  Kanada sounds like a little kid, and Tetsuo sounds no more menacing than he did in the original, but aside from those gripes everything is perfect.  Do yourself a favor, if you love great anime like Vampire Hunter D or Wicked City, pick up Akira, it is an all time landmark in anime, and now has never been a better time to purchase it.",1022371200,,1094,4.505050505050505
628548,4,6303305520,"The animation of Akira is a true landmark for its time (originally released in 1988). The city (Neo-Tokyo) is filled with details and the characters as well: they have lots of distinct traits beyond the more traditional type of anime, where almost all characters have large eyes, although the movies take place in Japan. Also the music that accompanied the feature -like most animes- was outstanding.
However, I admit that I had a hard time understanding certain parts of the movie, just like I did with Escaflone more recently. Some friends who are cult followers of the genre explained to me that the reason for this was the fact that the movie was derived from a comic book series from the early eighties. Therefore, unless you are big time into anime movies, except for the artistic side of the movie (animation, music) be ready for a story where you will have to fill in a lot of blanks. Also be ready for a movie with lots of violence: definitely not for children or people who are easily impressed with bloody scenes. My personal opinion: I'd much rather see 'Ghost in the Shell' or 'Final Fantasy' again.",1021852800,,1112,4.678571428571429

The only downside to this disk that I have currently found is in the new English dub of the film, which is drab and unemotional throughout.

I've seen Akira many times before in a VCD copy, but seeing it restored in DVD is like watching a whole new Anime. The new voice-overs are good, but sometimes you'll wonder if that is Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) dubbing some of the voices (there are dull and over-acting moments in the English Dub) - I suggest watching it in it's original Japanese Dub with the subtitles - nothing really beats the Jap language - it captures the character's emotions perfectly!
The 2nd Disc is jam-packed with extras. I wish they had the entire page run of the Akira comics in the DVD though... it would be a great read.
All in all, this is perfect. There are times that I wish they popped in a booklet of some sort (like the Starting a Fight manual in the Fight Club DVD) - it's also nice to see the characters in something printed.",1019952000,,983,4.377049180327869

The new dub is pretty good actually, a huge improvement in my opinion over the original (though I do miss the old dub's ""Kaneda!  Help me!!"").  The Japanese track was surprising.  This is one of the few anime where the mouth moves with the works.  Whoa. . .  The picture is also amazing.  If I didn't know better, I'd swear that this was made in the last two or three years!  The animation is smooth, crisp, and consistant.  The story is great; complex and gripping which is especially good since they took a HUGE manga/comic series and condensed it to a two hour movie (unlike X where they take a huge story and condense it to 90 minutes and butcher it completely).

As for the anime itself, the imagery is top notch, with attention to every small detail. From what I know, the original film was done without computer graphics. If you are a student of art, you will appreciate the effort put into each frame.

628632,3,6303305520,"Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE Akira. It is by far the most classic anime that I personally compare all others to, but the new DVD version was kind of a let down in one big way: the new English dubbing is HORRIBLE. I have been an Akira fan for years and originally owned the English dubbed copy for VHS. That's the version I am familiar with and have only seen it in that version previous to the DVD. I was shocked when I started to play my favorite anime film of all time in the dubbed mode to hear a completely different set of voices. Not to mention the changed dialogue, but that I could get over. It was the extreme lack of emotion of the voice actors that made this new dubbed version terrible. There is no feeling behind most of them. Worst of all was the new female voice for Kei. Kei's big speech she gives Kaneda when they are caught and put in jail is so wooden and monotone. It was by far the worst English dubbing I have ever heard and for a classic like Akira they could have done much better. Since this is a special edition I think they should have included the original English dubbing to let fans decide which version to listen to. Basically this new version makes the old English dubbed version non-existent and anyone who was a fan of it and wants it on DVD is out of luck.
Despite the horrible new English dubbing, the special features disk is jammed pack with documentaries, art, and photos that makes it well worth the extra $... over the standard version. The picture quality is also OUTSTANDING! They did a fantastic job restoring it to near perfect quality.

628633,4,6303305520,"Akira is definitely one of the best anime titles in existence, ranking up along with Ghost in the Shell, Robotech/Macross, Mononoke-Hime, and Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Like Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion, there is quite a bit of philosophy involved with Akira; that philosophy is mixed with a great storyline and stunning animation shows the true power of anime beyond the standard glitz and fan service of titles such as Elf Princess Rane.
The film is based upon the manga series of the same name.  However, those unfamiliar with the manga are likely to be rather confused at what appear to be key moments in the film.  At times, one action seems to follow another for no apparent reason.
I purposely purchased this DVD to replace my worn-out VHS copy.  What I find truly novel with the DVD version is the ability to use the optional information capsules scattered throughout the film.  When the capsule icon (from Kaneda's jacket) is shown in the corner of the screen, pressing Play/Enter will show a translation of various signs and graffiti in the scene.  This feature alone helps to improve one's understanding of the film, even if unfamiliar with the manga series.
However, the main reason I can only rate this a ""4"" is due to the DVD's incompatibility with the PlayStation2 console.  Unfortuantely, more and more anime DVDs in the States are incompatible with the PS2, and certainly some anime fans bought the PS2 for its games AND its DVD capabilities.  That such a high-ranking title in the (unofficial) anime canon is incompatible with such a high-profile gaming console with DVD capability is a true slap in the face to anime fans everywhere :-(",1017705600,,1672,4.862676056338028

I quote ""In 1988, the landmark Anime film, by director Katsuhiro Otomo, defined the cutting edge of Anime around the world.  By today's standards, AKIRA remains a landmark achievement in cel animation and retains the explosive impact of its highly detailed animation and its intensely violent saga of power and corruption.  Pioneer Entertainment proudly presents this classic film, completely restored and digitally re-mastered"".

I highly agree.  Still probably the best looking Anime today.  Mamoru Oshii and Manga Entertainment claim that their work of Ghost in the Shell exceeds the production values of AKIRA which is just about untrue in every possible way. Let it be known that AKIRA defines Japanamation. This is for young and old adult audiences alike, whether your looking forward to seeing some Japanamation for the first time or your a long-time fan looking for that one spectatular Anime to complete your library of the genre. This is it people, be happy and rejoice. This is definitely a purchase, I recommend buying it. And make sure you get the 2-disc Special Edition and not the regular edition.  Also I recommend Metropolis an anime that is supposedly going to really push the boundaries over this one, it's written by Katsuhiro Otomo creator and lead artist of AKIRA.",1014768000,,1311,5.098130841121495

It tells the tale of addiction of the Sticky Rice and the consequences of eating too much of it.

628703,5,6303305520,"July 7, 1988. This was the year when the great lord of corruption known as Akira, unleashed an unspeakable destruction by creating a huge explosion onto Tokyo with his own evil psychic abilities. Now Akira is dead after the end of the destruction. His insides are now preserved and kept inside individual canisters. Akira may be dead, but the memories of the great destruction of Tokyo, will never die. And to remember the great destruction caused by Akira, you can see that, from the helicopter view, Tokyo has a carved hole at the same place where Akira caused destruction in July 7, 1988. It resembled the shape of one of Akira's insides, and it's still there in the year A.D. 2019, 31 years after World War III (yeah...like that ever happened in our time). Now Tokyo is known as Neo Tokyo. Everything has changed since then. No corruption and definently no wars have occured. But it was soon discovered that 3 kids, who possesses the same power as Akira, still exist. But these kids were not evil like Akira. Unlike Akira, they know how to manage their powers without anger, but still, they considered Akira as their friend. When Neo Tokyo thought the corruption is over, they were wrong. A motorcycle gang of youths battle it out with rival gangs, known as the clowns. An over-tempered teenage boy named Tetsuo Shima soon harnessed the same power as the great Akira, after a few scientists gave him the ability to use psychic powers. Now that Tetsuo is totally out of control with his new psychic powers, will his friend, Kaneda, be able to stop Tetsuo from causing destruction ? Finally after four years of ignoring the hype of the movie, I finally came to my senses and started to purchase the movie ""Akira"". At first, I thought the animation was going to be crappy like in some old series, but I was dead wrong ! The animation stunned me with it's extremely high detail and cel animated motion. Though some characters look a bit unstylish with their striped panty hoses, over-curled hair, tight pants, leather jackets, and head bands (this movie was made in 1988, so what more do you expect), but the character detail looks great. Heck ! The motorcycles look cool, including Kaneda's bike ! It's almost like watching an anime from our generation. The voice acting is brilliant. Barely any flaws over here. The only irritating voice that seems to annoy me, is Kai's screechy voice. The guys who did Kaneda and Tetsuo's voice really sounded great. What do you expect ? They're the same guys who played as Vash and young Knives from Trigun ! The action is great. Do not expect any martial arts action coming from this anime. Just pure gang and military style action with lots of shooting, gang fights, and police brutality. This movie is extremely violent, so I wouldn't reccomend it to younger audiences to view this movie. Geez ! No wonder Ebert & Roper gave Akira ""Thumbs Up"". I didn't know that an anime movie like Akira would be this popular. I didn't think that a famous movie critic like Roger Ebert would actually give this movie a good rating. If you're looking for an anime with comedy, violence, and pulse pounding animation, look no further than Akira ! This is no doubt the best anime movie of its time !",1013126400,,3222,4.65438596491228
628704,5,6303305520,"Akira is among the father's of anime. As the two main character's scream out each others name in a fast paced conflict, your heart will probably be racing as fast as mine. Akira deal's with, and answer's, one of the question's that has become a paradox...what if we had the power of God at our disposal. The ability to destroy, create, protect, and become invincible.
Tetsuo is a youth that is plucked from his biker gang and surrendered to test's in a secret experiment that date's year's into the past. His cell's coincide with a powerful force known as Akira, a hidden entity buried within the guts of a submerged vault. These experiments with Tetsuo prove to be a deadly mistake.
Growing up within the boundaries of Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo and his best friend Kaneda have developed into teens that spend their lives wandering blindly through a daily struggle of survival. The gristled street's are plagued with ultra-violence, radical anti-government agencies, religeous cult's, gang rape, and conspiring political's. Within these form's are the molding's of these two central character's. Kaneda has spent his life protecting Tetsuo, and has developed into a hardened product of the system. A secret agency kidnaps and inspect's, Tetsuo. His body is subjected to test's and penetrating scans while he floats within the confines of massive prodding machine's. Once they determine his wave count is unusually high, the lead professor makes the decision to insert a power, known as Akira, into him.
As the implanted power invade's Tetsuo's mind he uses the strength to act out forces of violence on the society that created him.
Kaneda must decide whether friendship runs deeper than control, and discover's the reason's behind the three mysterious being's that share Tetsuo's power. Akira is a gorgeous pandora's box of tragedy, power, and violence. What would happen if you had the ability of God, and what would be the result? The answer is found within Akira.",1012780800,,1959,5.068111455108359

Who cares about dubbing, the whole reason i wanted to get this DVD is that the original japanese dialogue was included. If you have that, then who needs dubbing. I mean the original dub for Akira was campy at best. Dubbing was created for a weak minded culture such as ares. People who say they can't watch a subtitled movie are the same people who say they can't watch a black and while movie. So to appease these dim witted cretins, dubbing and colonization was born. so, come on people, grow a brain and watch it subbed ;)",1011398400,,652,4.441666666666666

The Big complant people have about this DVD was that it didn't have the original english Dub. Trust me don't complain, i imported this DVD as i am a massive Japanese animation fan (especially with the big budget ones like this) and wanted the tin case and all that, but not long ago i also bought the local Australian (local for me) release of the DVD as i noticed it had all three audio tracks on a single DVD.
Now i think i watched about 30mins of the original dub until i decided i remembered it to be better than it actually was. Now whenever i watch it, i always watch it in Japanese, overall everyones voices are better, especially Tetsuo's, who in Japanese truly sounds emotionally erratic and at times psycotic, it also gives the film a truer feel as it is the original language of the film.
A well earnt 5 stars. Everyone must see this film, especially now that this DVD has arrived to show it in its true form.",1011139200,5,1052,4.372448979591836
628749,4,6303305520,"Akira, as it was for many, was my first introduction to the world of Japanese Anime. It has always held a special place in my collection, and I'm still searching for the anime production that compares. Needless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend this film.
As for the review of this release, it is much like the old ivory soap ads.....99.44% pure. I love the original Japanese dialogue. I loved the feature that translates graffiti and other writing. I loved all the behind the scenes extras thrown onto this disc. One thing that I cannot understand is the decision not to include to original english dialogue.
While I understand that some people weren't happy with the original dubbing, I must admit that it was one of the things that drew me to the movie originally. Yes, it didn't hold as closely to the Japanese translation as the new dubbing does, but if I wanted the real translation I would have happily watched the subtitled japanese version! Fortunately, I like the Japanese language version, because that is now the only version that I can bring myself to watch. To watch it in English without the old voices that I'm used to is like trying to watch new muppet productions....Kermit just doesn't sound like Kermit! I'm sorry, but it's all I can focus on.
Bottom line: If you've never seen Akira, or if you've only seen it once or twice, this version will surely please. But if you grew up listening to the Colonel say, ""It's not a soldier's job to make policy. I follow my orders,"" you may be disappointed by the new english dialogue.

628750,4,6303305520,"?Akira? is considered by most to be the masterpiece of Anime films. Made in 1988 it is a landmark film, both by the many great animated sequences and the detailed story. The film is rather graphic, but not many Anime films aren?t. While the film is groundbreaking for both animation and film, it is marred by over length. The animation to me, seems a little more ?cartoonish,? than films such as ?Perfect Blue? or ?Ghost in the Shell.? In a way it really doesn?t hurt it, since the film acts as a very eccentric, exaggerated science fiction film. Also the film was made in 1988, the 80s where a much different time than the 90s. Since then the animation has matured, and things are looking more realistic. But without classic 80s Anime films such as ""Akira,"" ""Vampire Hunter D"" and ""Wicked City,"" the Anime industry may be lost.",1010361600,,828,4.601351351351352
628751,4,6303305520,"I was extremely excited about the release of the ""special edition"" of Otomo Katsuhiro-san's ""AKIRA""! I was also looking quite forward to the ""new English dubbing"" -- but therein lies the problem, and the reason why I (and many others) feel that it falls short of the coveted ""Five Stars"" it so legitimately deserves.
Although I am appreciative of the fact that the new overdubbing is more faithful to the original Japanese dialogue, many of us (myself included) were introduced to this spectacular film years ago with its American release in theatres, and most if not all of us have some very cherished memories of the film's original English dubbing. One of the things we had all looked forward to and hoped for with the release of ""Akira"" in DVD format was not only the ""new"" English dialogue, but also the *inclusion* of the ""original"" English dialogue so many of us are familiar with!
Sadly, this was not to be. I somehow suspect that the decision to do this was made intentionally-- as sort of a DVD version of the ""Old Coke/New Coke"" scam --in an attempt to rake in a few extra bucks from all of us old fogey stogies with the fond memories. If that is indeed the case, then I am ashamed to admit that I will be one of those who will be first in line plunk down my hard earned bucks to relive the memory.
The ""original"" English dub, though less literal and somewhat more paraphrasical in its delivery, actually ""connected"" better with an English-language audience more so than the ""new"" version, while still remaining faithful to the overall sense of the original Japanese dialogue.
One of the things I DO like about the new dubbed version, which some others will likely disagree with me on, has to do with the re-assignment of voices to the ""Numbers"" (Takashi, Kiyoko, and Masaru): The little child voices, statures and mannerisms are nicely contrasted against the aged hair, facial features and frailties they possess.
Final recommendation for the ""special edition""?: Buy it, Rent it, or Bum it off of a friend, but by all means SEE it! -- And make every effort to do likewise whenever Pioneer decides to get around to producing the new ""enhanced visual"" version with the old ""original English"" dialogue.
P.S. -- Be sure to check out the special feature regarding the ""Music of Akira""; It is a very informative and a very enjoyable piece.",1010188800,,2345,4.708029197080292

The action in this story does not let up. The motorcyle scenes are just so well conceived -- they're breathtaking. You also begin to relate to the characters of Kanaeda (the cool popular leader type) and Tetsuro (the quieter runt member of the teenage gang).
The deeper meanings of human evolution and the huge metaphor for Japan's resurrection after WWII are not to be missed. But there are some small side-plots going on in this film.

Back in the 80's (70's?) Disney ruled the world with an iron fist (Okay, so mabye the world hasn't changed THAT much!) cartoons were made ""for kids"" and nothing more!  Everyone knew that the word ""cartoon"" ment ""kids stuff"" or something like that, anyway...when Streamline Pictures first released this movie people reacted with shock!  People being shot, smashed, blown up (From the inside none-the-less)...this movie was a madhouse of gore!  Blood, language, MILD MILD MILD nudity (Really), there was even a scean where a guys guts just spilt on the floor (No joke)!!!
THIS wasn't something people were used to in cartoons...heck, this was definetly NOT ""kids stuff"" like cartoons normally were!  Not only was it bloody as hell, but the plot was complex and weird!  Remember those old horror flicks (You know, the one's that were actually smart)?  The plot in this movie resembled the weird twisted plot of an old Hitchcock movie (Although STILL not nearly as suspenseful)!  Of course lets not forget the fact that the animation was lightyears ahead of it's time!  People were wondering if Disney would ever make it to this level of animation with their films.
Whether they did or not is not for me to say, but lets just say it started the controversy of whether or not american animation was better then japanesse animation!  Not to mention the rockin soundtrack that was also tacked on made this one solid adult movie!  Now 20 (30?) years later, Pioneer Entertainment decided it was time for this wonderful movie to break out of it's shell and be seen again!

628841,5,6303305520,"Akira is one of those movies that you never forget. The images are extremely powerful and graphic, so that they stick with you long after the movie is over. Despite its sometimes-confusing plot line, this movie is a wonderfully written, chilling look into the future, and into humanity as a whole. The movie more or less centers around a teenage biker gang in Neo-Tokyo, thirty-years after World War III. The main characters, Kaneda and Tetsuo, are two childhood friends who are constantly in competition with each other (Tetsuo being the weaker, taunted one.) Regardless, Tetsuo still looks up to Kaneda. As the introduction moves out of the chase scene, an interesting encounter with an odd looking child (who awakens the physic abilities lying dormant within Tetsuo's mind) truly begins the movie.
The animation quality in this movie is almost enough of a reason to buy it. The detail is incredible, umparalled even by Disney?s standards. No one background or setting is used twice, and the environment is in constant change, be it blinking lights or a person exiting a random building. Oddly enough, the Bladerunner-esque buildings throughout the movie also help to establish the feeling of urgency, and the sensation of teetering on the edge of something great, something that we cannot possibly understand. The characters also move in a realistic, smooth motion, something that is missing from many anime television shows, like Pokemon or Digimon.
The music in this movie is also an aspect that really stands out, with a sound all its own. With this new DVD cleanup, you can hear every bell, whistle and drum beat. It sounds more Japanese than most animes out there, and that is not a bad thing. Every single song fits the actions incredibly well, from the haunting Requiem at the end, to the oddly infectious Japanese drums in Kaneda, heard during the motorcycle chase scene and credits of the movie. Hats off to Shoji Yamashiro.
The voice acting is good, but not great. I feel that the original dubbing job used voice actors much better suited to their animated counterparts. For example, Kaneda's original voice actor fit his attitude well, as his voice had the same inflection and as a teenage boy's does. The new voice actor, however, sounds like an adult trying to speak like a teenager. Tetsuo?s voice sometimes sounds a little off too, as the inflection in his words do not always coincide with the action on screen There is no mention of the original script or dub however, but there is a small interview with the English voice actors of Kaneda, Tetsuo, and Kei.
The extras on this DVD are excellent, with detailed information on how the music was created, the voice actors of both the English and Japanese scripts, and it also holds about 4,500 stills from the movie and the entire movie's storyboard. The menus are easy to follow and understand, and contain colorful backgrounds with music-sound bites from the movie.
Overall, this DVD is a must have for any Sci-fi or animation fan. It shows the best of what anime has to offer. You will never forget the magnificent story, or the unforgettable characters that make this movie a classic, inside and outside of anime.
Remember though, this movie is NOT for young children and the squeamish. If your child is under the age of fifteen, or if you do not like the sight of blood and body parts, the movie is probably not for you.",1006387200,108,3392,4.829896907216495

628882,5,6303305520,"I got the Limited Edition Tin within the first week of it's release.  Well, to say the least it was worth my money and then some and unlike many of my DVD's don't collect dust.
The picture is just incredible.  There were a couple scenes where the reds were slightly too bright but it was not so obvious that it detracted from my viewing of the movie.  This is an entirely hand drawn animation that is still more detailed than anything Disney or even Pixar supplies us today and it was treated with the dignity it deserved.
Japanese Audio is always the way to go.  I wish they had remixed it in the Dolby 5.1 but unless you have an elaborate entertainment system setup it isn't that signifigant.  Just would have been a nice treat.  Voices were PERFECT.  It just all fit perfectly. I love the Japanese voice for Tetsuo, he just had that perfect, insane, but you still feel for him to a certain extent, something that I felt was lost in the English translation.
English Audio: Um... how does anyone miss that crap of a job dub done in '88?  Masaru sounded like my grandfather for crying out loud, the girlfriends of Kanada's biker gang have thick Jersey accents, Kaneda sounds like he's 30ish and it goes on (I won't even begin to mention that it was the FIRST dub that screwed up the japanese script, not vice versa!).  And this is exactly what people complain about.  I've heard a lot of people complain about the new voice of Kaneda because he sounds too young.  Did everyone forget that Kaneda and Tetsuo are in the age ranger of 14-17?  They are supposed to sound young!  Same problem came up with the kids.... in the Japanese script I hate to say it but the numbers do sound like small children.  No heavy accents, when I put on the subtitles with the dub to see how well they matched, it was remarkably close to the original script.  Goodness forbid this movie wasn't confusing enough to understand without the script being screwed up.
Extras: The menu was simple yet elegant with the motorcycle theme. (who wouldn't want Kaneda's bike?) And the capsule mode was interesting since I have always wondered what some of the writing says here and there.  Documentaries and restoration features are nice for those who really enjoy seeing how painstaking the art of animation is.  There is an index to all the terms in the movie and Manga for those who want to learn a little more or didn't quite get a certain part.  Probably the best set of extras ever seen in an anime DVD.
Movie: I won't review it, there are plent of others right behind me and anything I say is redundant.  You will most likely either love it, hate it, or simply not understand it.  A classic in my book, heavily overrated by others.",1005868800,2,2704,4.479591836734694
628883,1,6303305520,I am an old time fan of Akira. I bought this DVD with high exceptions. I just want to put out to the fans that are thinking of buying the DVD to please reconsider. The original sound effects and the old voices are gone. Some company takes pride with ruining the movie's original sound English translation. Shame on them for retranslating the movies and stripping all the cool sounds. Like when number 26 (I think that is the little guy's name) is moaning and the windows break out of the building. In this new version most of the coolest sound effects are gone. I couldn't even finish watching it because the movie is ruined. The picture and the plot are still the same.... But the sound stinks. The VHS version is better for the old time fans.,1005523200,2,744,4.437956204379562
628884,5,6303305520,"What can you say about Akira, the manga or the movie, that hasn't already been said? It's brilliant, to
say the least. The animated version, like the graphic novel series, has withstood the test of time most
honorably. That said, it's great fun to watch, and there's so much detail that it will require several
viewings to fully drink it all in. (To this day, I still haven't picked up on all the details in the scenes with
Kaneda's gang and their assigned groupies. Talk about complex!)
 As a big anime fan, I of course recommend you see it in the original Japanese. Sure, there's no fancy
mix like you get with the English tracks, but no English dub can really do this film any justice. Besides,
this is a film set in Japan with Japanese characters, and really should be watched in its original language. (On that note, I must warn those of you that don't have it yet: The video uses the opening
and end credits from Streamline's previous subtitled version of the VHS, which gives credit to the
original Japanese cast. Pioneer adds their own voice credits after the originals run. Thought you'd get
the original Japanese print?)",1005523200,6,1130,4.621890547263682

628887,5,6303305520,"For those of you whining about your old dub let me just put it this way, that was garbage.  Names were mispronounced, the storyline was changed, the kids had voices of adults, the list goes on.  Pioneer did an excellent job re-dubbing this movie and trying to match the script and the voices to the original japanese track.  The video looks very great after this restoration.  Overall an awesome movie.",1004054400,2,402,4.7
628888,5,6303305520,"Everything that should have been said about Akira is probabily said, so let's focus on a review of thje new master done for this DVD. While old (1988), this feature looks brand new on this master, thanks to the million dollar restoration proccess that Pioneer pursued to release this title. It made me wonder how was to be on a theather in Japan when it was released, watching a brand new print, probabily the best comparison to the experience of watching this DVD.
Both audio tracks sounds great, and considering that it was done in 1988, it's amazing to see how much the producers invested at that time on this feature, which features Dolby Surround Prologic sound on the japanese version (if you're to consider that most recent features are still using stereo sound).
The second disc, packed of extras is a must. If you liked Akira, you deserve a copy of the limited edition, which is the only way to get your hands on one of those shiny discs. Featuring a making of, interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo, musical clips and so many stuff it'd be hard to list, Pioneer hits big with this title.
Just as a side note, the special edition, on a special package, had 100,000 copies issued, which sold out TWO WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE the release date.",1003795200,2,1247,4.621621621621622
628928,1,6303305520,"I'm going to have to wade against the current and give this a really negative review. Having heard about this movie for years without getting a chance to see anything but a few clips, I rushed home from the video rental store where I found it with great expectations. But although the animation was every bit as impressive as I expected, the story itself was worse than just nonsense, it was DULL. I don't fully blame Akira's creator for this boring confused mess, after all he had to condense a large, complex work thousands of pages long into a relatively short movie. However, I found it to be as boring and vacuous as the Americanized version of the original Godzilla. Like Godzilla, much of the movie is taken up by an (albeit visually impressive) monstrosity running rampant through Tokyo and brainlessly destroying everything in its way without any clear motive. Sure, the original comic, which I haven't read (a movie should stand on its own), probably makes sense and has some meaning and depth, much like the original Japanese version of Godzilla is supposed to be a powerful allegory of the nuking of Hiroshima, but personally I don't find the sight of animated buildings being destroyed for what seems to be an eternity any more interesting than watching it happen to a bunch of models built by Toho.  It does begin with an interesting storyline about government experimentation and study of psychics and about a motorcycle gang, but with the film's chopped up story, it just becomes a confused mess and an excuse for the later destruction.
Akira is worth watching for those purely interested in the technical aspects of animation, and one of it plusses is that it actually has oriental characters (much Japanese animation portrays futures in which there isn't one single oriental). But neither does it fully avoid the disturbingly conformist manner in which human physical characteristics are (unrealistically) portrayed in Japanese animation (big eyes, etc. -- how about some individual artistic expression?), and there are a number of movies now available in North America with equally impressive animation and better unlike back when Akira first came out. Akira did help introduce a new genre to North America, which is a wonderful accomplishment, so it is still of historic interest, but I have to pass on Akira itself.",1003276800,10,2336,4.974424552429667
628929,5,6303305520,"i've watched this over and over again for two good reasons. one is the depth and graphic nature of the script. theres always some deep moral issue or some conflict with individuality and society or whatever.
  and then theres the animation. a lot of people mention the end fight sequences and the distinct style. this is really really good. but what really does it for me is attention to the little things. stuff like the way smoke moves and twists, or the trail of light coming of the motorcycles. violence is present but i don't think its overdone. everything has a purpose or reason for being in this movie
  also theres the pace of the movie and the effects of using sound or silence.
  all add up to a good movie with a distinct goal by the creator. the dvd is good because the image is really crisp and the special features are ok. this version has less than the more expensive one, but i don't think it really matters. i'd just watch the feature.
  i recommend this to anyone except those who think they are too mature for cartoons. those people can go watch their long winded p.t. andersons (not that he's a bad director, just a little wordy).
  i also recommend everyone to watch it in Japanese with the subtitles. i think the jokes seem funnier and the expressions match better with its original language.",1003190400,,1315,4.510548523206751
628930,5,6303305520,"I am a huge Anime fan, yet until October 16th 2001, I had not seen Akira. There are two legendary movies I saw for the first time this week. Two movies, considered by most to be the best of their kind. Citizen Kane, and Akira.
 I watched Citizen Kane yesterday, and then finished watching the Akira Special edition (bought the limited TIN) a few minutes ago. I can see why both movies are referred to as the greatest movies of their kind. Much like Citizen Kane, Akira influenced every movie of it's genre. Much like Citizen Kane, Akira set standards for others to follow.
 The first thing I want to comment on, are the extras. They are FANTASTIC! The second obviously is the movie. This movie is what American Audiences consider the best Anime. The first anime to be so successful in America was Akira. This movie belongs in a museum, and not because it's ancient, but because it's a piece of art.
 Every anime has it's ""corny"" moments. There is always some point or another where there is some over used dialogue, or something about the script makes you laugh at it's absurdity, not Akira. It's a VERY ORIGNAL movie, and you can see why all other animes want to be IT.
 Akira is set in troubled times (Aren't they all?). The politicians are corrupt, the economy isn't booming, and the last thing the people of the world seem to care about, are teenagers. Our heroes are ill mannered ruffians, who are part of a biking gang. Somehow they get involved in a government experiment, and one of them becomes a major guinea pig of these experiments. The brotherly relationship between the two male heroes is very touching and is very real, because it's not overdone. The chemistry between the hero and the heroin is very satisfactory. My favourite part is probably when the General decides to start a coup against the corrupt politicians.
 The Visual quality of this special edition is actually quite brilliant. I'd go as far as to say, this is almost as good looking as Samurai X, or Blood. The most memorable visuals in the movie are the Tokyo scenes from a Bird's Eye view. They are simply breathtaking, and remind us of any metropolitan city, such as Toronto, New York.. or Tokyo :)
 There are not too many parts in the movie where the lighting is good. This makes for some excellent shade visuals. Sometimes the lighting is red, or blue, and the shading is brilliant.
 The movie is not typical at all. Very little comedy, or nudity. Though the violence takes a while to get used to. I really enjoyed this movie for it's visual prowess, and it's great story line. I found the characters memorable, whilst the motorbikes were definitely out of this world! Certain characters possess superhuman powers, and the display is excellent. The physics are well thought out, and the people suffering seemed all too real.
 Do I think Akira is the best Anime of all time? I don't know, but it's certainly one of my favourite animes.",1003104000,,2919,4.621621621621622
628931,3,6303305520,"About 2 years ago is when I rented ""Akira"".  I am very fond of actor, Cam Clarke, who plays Kaneda in the original, so 2 years later, when this so called ""Special Edition"" came out on DVD, I rented it to see it.  I was very Disipointed, because neither Cam or the other original cast, such as Drew Thomas (Tetsuo), was involved.  Instead, it's replaced by no-named actors with no talent.  Second of all, the dialouge has changed too...remember the scene in which the gang is ""Deciplined"" by their P.E. teacher?  Instead of him yelling ""Shut Up!!"", it's instead ""Decipline"".  Third, the color format has changed, making everything look brighter.  But enough blabber...let's talk.
In 1988, WWIII has just ended, but a nuclear holocast hs destroyed everything...including Tokyo.  21 years later, Tokyo has been rebuilt and is now called ""Neo-Tokyo"".  The locals believe that a strange god-like force caused the holocast, called ""Akira"", which was named after a boy whom was experimented on with the powers.  Neo-Tokyo is a ticking time-bomb in the world of politics, which the entire city is spilt up in three groups...The Politcians, the Government Military and the residents.  The city's citizens are constantly breaking out into riots and cults, leaving the Military and Police a hand full.  Meanwhile, two gangs, The Clowns and the E.X.P.L.O.D.E.s battle out on the dying highways.  The EXPLODE leader, Kaneda (which in this version is pernounced ""Canada"", others it is prnounced ""Canaeda"") with his awesome BMW Red-Fire Motorcycle, leads his men in a bloody battle.  The youngest of them is Tetuso (""Tent-Sue-oh""), a anal retentive 16-year old, who wants to kill his first Clown (no pun intended).  Meanwhile, a man and a blue, pale skinned boy run through downtown, being chased by cops.  The man is shot to death and the boy escapes, within a few minutes later, is run down by Tetsuo.  Tetsuo is paralyzed from the crash.  Before Kaneda can assist his best friend, the government takes him and the gang is arrested.  A few days later, Tetsuo returns, exausted and banged up, but amazingly, isn't paralyzed like the night before.  His girlfriend, Karori (Carrie, really)  and him decide to run away, but are run down by the Clowns.  He is beaten up and his girlfriend is raped.  But he then loses it, and kills one of them with his bare hands.  He starts to hear a kid saying ""AKIRA!!!"" and his falls into a state of shock.  Once again, he is taken by the government.  Kaneda wants to find out what is going on here, so he goes to a secret alliance, run by a girl he admires named Kay.  Her Boyfriend, Roy, works for a sleazy rich manor (which for some reason, if made a live movie, would perfectly be played by Marlon Brando) who is trying to get Neo-Tokyo's governmet to it's knees.  Tetsuo is starting to get strange powers too.  He then escapes to find the one known as ""Akira""...
I could g on, but you hve to rent it for yourself.  The story goes on and on, too, so it would be impossible to tell it all for you.  Rent it.  Or better off, rent the original.  The stor is more in depth than the Director's Cut and the acting is better.  Peace.",1002844800,2,3150,4.667272727272727

The story of what happens in the process unfolds itself in the 2 hours of non-stop entertainment. And let me make clear, there is a REAL story here. The plot is hazy right up until the end, but the story has you wide-eyed all the way thru. No unneccesary violence to fill time, just pure action.

The DVD restores the film's animation quality to the glory that it deserves, and that we had not previously seen on video releases here in America.
This rerelease also sports a new English dub which follows the original script more closely than the first dub did. The new voice actors also play their parts with zeal and emotion, although I do miss the first voice of The Colonel.

the biggest thing is the new translation and dub.  Although I'll have to admit I didn't mind the original, and I kind of miss the voice of Leonardo (the teenge mutant ninja turtle) as Kaneda.

the only thing about this dvd edition that bothered was the dubbing of the movie. there is a brand new dubbing version made for this particular dvd edition. i, myself, prefer subtitles. it keeps the original language intact and more truer to the story. dubbing usually requires editing the english actors' voices to meet with the lip movements. the voice acting doesn't seem to match the movie but since this is my preference to watching this anime, it should be up to each individual. but you can still choose between english, japanese with subtitles, and japanese (for those fluent in the language) this is a wonderful edition for those who can find it. the material accompanying the movie disc has plenty of material for those wanting to learn about the production of the movie itself.",1000425600,,1407,4.966101694915254

628994,5,6303305520,"What can I say about this movie? One thing is for sure, it's not for casual watching. Every single sentence in this movie is important, you have to pay complete attention to understand it, and even then you won't understand it first time. The first time I watched it, I had no idea what it all meant, but it was still hauntingly beautiful. It left me with curiousity, I watched again and understood a little more. I asked questions and watched another time, and it took three viewings of this movie for it all to come together. This movie has enough plots for 5 movies, it's an amazing film animated or otherwise. If you want questions answered go to a search engine and type in ""akira FAQ"" It might help out a bit.
The music in this movie is so unique, it's a blend between ethnic and futuristic, but it really fits the mood of the movie. This has to be one of my top 10 movies because everything in this movie has a reason. It may not seem that way upon first viewing. But keep watching it comes all together.
 Example: Tetsuo has a dream about him and Kaneda playing when they're young. He sees the building in front of him collapse, and then he himself physically collapses, but Kaneda isn't harmed.
This wasn't stuck in the movie just to capture the attention of the viewers. The meaning of the dream is that Tetsuo would destroy the city, and then himself, but his love for Kaneda would keep Kaneda alive. This is one example of hidden meanings lying within this movie.
As for the dub, yes the first dub was better, but even if it was on the dvd. I'd still choose the Japanese, it honestly does the best job of portraying the characters emotions. So don't complain about the dub, watch the Japanese, it's better then both.
The animation is top notch, and it is very vivid. It amazes me to think this film was made in 1988.
Akira will frustrate those who are not willing to spend some time thinking about a movie. But for the rest of us, it's a film we can actually think about, it's not a movie that shoves everything in your face, you will come to your own conclusions, and that's what makes it so beautiful.",999302400,,2115,4.368020304568528
628995,5,6303305520,"But I'll try anyway.
I'm just now seriously getting into anime, thanks to my roommate.  Of course, even people who haven't watched a piece of anime in their lives have heard of AKIRA.  It seems to be considered by many *the* definitive anime.
So when I heard that a new, more faithful dub would be released on DVD--with a second disc full of extras--I considered this a great opportunity to leap into it with both feet.
I just finished watching the English dub, and let me say I was totally blown away.  First away, this was the best dub of an anime I've ever seen.  The VAs were very good, and my roommate told me that this was much more accurate than the old English dub, which I haven't seen.
Pioneer's remastering of the video was well worth it.  The animation looks as if it could have been drawn yesterday, but this film is more than a decade old.  The audio remix was nice as well.  And the ""capsule option"" that explained all the Japanese signs and such was very helpful.
The disc full of extras was astounding.  The sheer mass of stills was mindblowing, nearly 5000!  Add to that an interview with the creator/writer/director, a behind-the-scenes look at the music and the remastering, and original Japanese trailers...WOW!
As for AKIRA itself, I can't say much without ruining it; much of the enjoyment comes from having things revealed.  I'll just say that it involves Kaneda and Tetsuo, two members of a motorcycle gang, and what happens when they encounter a fugitive on the run from the military.

Akira is a story of Psycic Powers, motercycle gangs, corrupt government and the horrific vision of Neo-Tokyo. In it's release on July 16th 1988 (in Japan), It was a hit, state of the art sound, picture, and animation made it No. 1 box office hit the day it was released. For the US it came out in 1989 from a company called Streamline Pictures which introduced Akira and other Animes into the US. US Critics think the anime industry began on July 16th 1988 because anime was never very popular until Akira's release. The Akira I'm talking about though is the version im rating right now. It's Digitally remasterd through a film cleaning proscess which removes all unwanted dirt and scratches. The sound is remasterd through THX and Dolby Digital 5.1. This is a masterpeice and I think that if your an Anime fan or sombody not afraid to try somthing new, you sohuld take a look into AKIRA",999129600,2,974,4.5397727272727275

628999,4,6303305520,"When I was around ten years old, I thought ""Akira"" was one of the greatest things ever created. I saw it so many times that I knew it frame-by-frame, could tell you every little guy who gets squashed by Tetsuo's powers, and could speak along with the character's dialogue. I even bought every original Marvel comic of ""Akira,"" the soundtrack, ""making of"" documentary, cards and had a poster of ""Akira"" on the wall in my room for a long time. It prompted me to rent every Anime I could get a hold on for a long time. Nothing I've seen yet in Anime has been able to beat ""Akira."" However, I much neglected this classic for a long time and forget all about it until this DVD came out. I was so excited to see that ""Akira"" was being restored and given DVD treatment that it deserved. Well, when I finally saw it I was both stunned and horrified. The new remastered picture quality of ""Akira"" without any complaint is spectacular and breathtaking. This alone is the reason you should see the new ""Akira."" A lot of extra detail that is hard to spot in the original is in full focus here. It's so clear that sometimes night seems like day. However the new ""Akira"" Unfortunately has two errors that made me sadly give it four stars. Those two errors are the vocals and new dialogue! I know the first speakers in the original English version of ""Akira"" sounded like Americans but the new speakers are just laughable. Keneda sounds like a seven year old boy and the Akira kids made mew laugh the first time I heard them. In the original version of ""Akira,"" at points they made me chill with fear (Sorry for sounding so cheesy.) I could not take any of the characters seriously when hearing the new speakers. The old speakers in the original version spoke with the right timing and dramatic skills. The new speakers sound like it's a read through. The new script is also horrible. All of the great one liners are butchered and filled a lot of irrelevant swearing and comments. It's so bad that I feel like the new ""Akira"" is at the same level as the original. Now that I told you my criticism. Let me say that ""Akira"" is still the greatest Anime ever and is still amazing by today standards. It has everything a great film should have. The themes are everything from politics to spirituality to an analysis of the human condition and the role of science playing God. And if you don't get the dramatic themes, it's just amazing to watch for the graphics.

629050,2,6303305520,"""Akira"" is the best example of why anime can often times be so frustrating to watch. Many praise ""Akira"" as the greatest film of its kind, a landmark in animation. True, from a visual standpoint, ""Akira"" is dazzling, especially in this new DVD version where the colors are more vibrant than ever before. But can anyone make sense of the damn thing? I've seen it a few times and still couldn't tell you what happens in the last 30 minutes. And to be quite honest, I don't think I care. The characters are never devloped all that well, and their faces are drawn in such a manner that it is easy to confuse them. The new voice dubbing doesn't help either; everyone in Kaneda's gang sounds exactly the same. Then there's the seemingly requisite misogyny found in many anime releases, but not the best -- ""Princess Mononoke"" still stands taller than all other films in the genre. Is ""Akira"" a masterpiece? No. But I suspect that it will always be seen as one because of its cult film status. But it just doesn't work for me; I'm more interested in the fates of the characters in ""Final Fantasy IX"" on PSX than I am in these street thugs.",998784000,5,1132,4.447115384615385
629051,5,6303305520,"Alright, I'm not sure what Danny Kim, who's review is posted up there, is thinking. I mean, he's entitled to his own opinion, and if he feels that the voices in this version are inferior, I guess that's up to him, but I feel I should set the record straight here so people don't get the wrong idea. The voices in this new dub of the movie much more closely mimic those of the original Japanese production, which was the intent of the crew doing the new version all along. For example, the numbers do indeed now all have the voices of children, but perhaps something Mr. Kim missed is that they ARE children, despite what they look like. If you flip to the Japanese audio, sure enough they all have very childlike voices, even Masaru, who in the original english dub had a much more gravely, mature sounding voice. As for the Colonel, his voice sounds much less over the top, keeping in line, again, with the original Japanese vocal track. He sounds much more thoughtful and reserved this time around, which I believe fits his character a bit more readily than the all out gutteral barks that made up most of his original english voice. Basically, if you really loved the original translation and dub of Akira, you may not be too thrilled with this one, mostly because it differs so much. It's kind of a shock to hear all the voices you've grown used to changed around on you. I know a lot of people grew very attached to it, and for the time it was very well done, but if you want what the author had intended for Akira, this dub is as close as you're going to get short of just leaving the audio on Japanese (which would be a shame, because a lot of thought went into this dub.) I found myself occasionally pining for the original dub myself, and I do wish Pioneer had found some way to include it as a third audio track, but oh well. In my own personal opinion, I liked Kaneda's original dub voice a little better, but more for the sound of it than the performance. I think the new artist does a better job overall in conveying Kaneda's emotional range. He sounded like a bit of a dunderhead in the first one. Tetsuo, well...sue me, but I can hardly tell the difference. They sound very similar to me, and therefore I prefer the new one due to it's superior translation. Kei, Ryu, The Doctor, and most of the supporting cast sound similar to me, and no voice really stuck out as seeming out of place besides Nazu's. He has a normal voice now, and oddly, it doesn't fit him as well as the warped one he got in the original. Nonetheless, I've grown to appreciate this dub much more than the original. Then again, I'm something of a purist, and typically won't watch a dub to any movie unless it's done as well as the original and has an accurate translation to boot. This dub is just that. It's basically the Japanese script put into English, with voices that sound as similar as possible. Bottom line: If you've never seen Akira, or consider yourself an Anime purist, get this version. If you watched it back in the day and feel like that version was fine the way it was, and don't mind a minorly sub-par translation, stick with the first one. I personally can't reccomend this disk enough. I grabbed one of the metal limited edition ones, but I'm pretty sure this has the same stuff in it.",998697600,3,3291,4.379084967320262
629052,5,6303305520,"I really haven?t watched too many Anime films, so I?m no expert on them.  I have finally seen ""Akira"", and I loved it.  Especially in this new remastered version.
I apologize, but I can?t really lay out the whole story for you.  The greatness in this film is uncovering the mysteries that this Anime poses.  Just know that there is brillant story telling, stunning action sequences, and a lot of suspence in this sci-fi film which creates a dark and horrifying future.  It has a very complex plot, and at times may seem very confusing.  This is definitely a movie you have to see more than once in order to understand it.  Even if you don?t understand every single thing the first time you see it, you?ll still  enjoy it because the animation is cutting edge and puts computer animation to shame.  It this film was animated the way ""Final Fantasy"" was, it wouldn?t be the same movie, and it would lose the sharpness and intensity that it already has.  I?ve only seen ""Akria"" twice, but after seeing it a second time, I think I understand it a little more.  I will have to watch it again in order to fully understand it, maybe even more.
A lot of people don?t like the new dubbed version.  The first time I saw it, I watched it in subtitles and got lost very quickly.  Watching it dubbed made it easier for me to understand and I thought the voices sounded okay.  Then again, I?ve never heard the original dubbed version, so I can?t tell you if it?s better or worse.
I love how this remastered version looks and sounds.  This is a classic that shouldn?t be missed by anyone.  Don?t let the complexity of this film aggravate you, just enjoy it the first time, and then you can watch it again and pay a little more attention to it and understand it more.  What is ""Akira""?  That?s something you?ll have to find out in this thought provoking, and visually stunning film.  I loved every minute of it.

629055,4,6303305520,"First of all, a bit of practical advice - buy the DVD, not the VHS. This is because of the incredible palette of colors in the movie and the overall use of dark colors to set the mood, which come out much better on a DVD. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is some plot holes. I don't mean an inconclusive ending, I mean simple plot holes which pop up every now and then, such as, why do the children act as children and are afriad of blood (in the nightmare scene), when they should be about 40 years old? All sort of small things. But they can really be ignored, since they get forgotten in the intensity of the plot. I guess I'll have to read the manga one day. That being said, I think this movie is magnificent in all respects - scope, quality of animation, music (very original!), intensity of plots, characterization, directing - everything. It's one of those movies which can be enjoyed even by non-anime viewers. I would really recommend it to every fan of either SF or anime. A word of advice - this perhaps is not the best movie to introduce you to anime, since it will cause you to suffer from the so called ""akira syndrome"" - you'll expect every movie after it to be as good, which is actually the other way around - most other animes aren't as good.",998092800,,1283,4.240816326530612
629056,5,6303305520,"""Akira"" has a special place in my teenage years, seeing as it was my introduction to adult Japanese animation. While re-watching the film on the new special edition DVD, I remember why I enjoyed it in the first place. While it's not a word-by-word translation of the comic from which it was based (if it was, we would be talking about ""Akira"" the trilogy, not ""Akira"" the movie), it's a solid piece of animation that holds up to today's computer generated epics. Seeing the detailed animation (particularly with the Tetsuo ""monster"", still an image that's hard to shake out of my system) and realizing it's only been 13 or so years since it's been released is quite amazing, as how it was all done with traditional cel animation. The picture and sound on this transfer was incredible, and I found the ""capsule option"" for reading the Japanese text helpful (being as how I'm not fluent in Japanese to begin with). I'm still wading through the extra features on this special edition (particularly the production materials, which has an IMMENSE amount of stills and images from the movie and comic) and I've had this thing for some time now.

629057,5,6303305520,"Akira is a very hard movie to follow, but is considered the classic anime because of its impact on the release of anime in the US and its animation quality, which was quite outstanding for the time.
This rerelease makes the classic that much better, with a new translation making the plot much easier to follow, although you still shouldn't expect to understand it after the first viewing. On the visual side, the cleaning up of the film is a must for any DVD, but what really makes this film shine is the color enhancement. The original release suffers from that washed out 80s color look, and this rerelease lets you see the film in beautifully vibrant colors that once again put the animation close to on par with the best modern accomplishments.
This special edition comes with a fairly interesting second disk. It comes with three documentaries from the 80s, which are simply voiced over or subtitled, but still very interesting to a fan, and a short new documentary about the making of the rerelease. The glossary provides some good back story, which is quite helpful  for a movie as compressed as this one, although it is a tedious way to read it. The image gallery is huge, but mostly black and white production sketches. This isn't an extravaganza of features like the ones you see on Pixar DVDs or New Line Platinums, but for a fan it is worth the extra 11 bucks, plus you get a cool tin case (and it's a very nice case, not like the cheap sleeve on the T2 Ultimate Edition).",998006400,2,1485,4.541044776119403

When you're right, you're right...
Two discs -- the Movie (excellent), and the accompanying documentaries (excellent).
""Akira"" is blow-out anime on a grand and epic scale.  It's all here, and it *isn't* like Disney.  Motorcycle chases, fist fights, carnage, and the destruction of Tokyo (twice).  Mitsuo Iwata gets it *all right*.  If this was Disney they'd have to stop for a song, but Akira doesn't even stop for gas.  Beautiful imagery, and astounding craftsmanship.
And this was before the world went digital.
As for the accompanying materials (Production Report etc.)  It's all here!  I never thought I would do this, but I found myself examining the STILL FRAMES and STORY BOARDS!  On my 20"" TV!
The power of DVD over VHS is a dramatic improvment in resolution, color fidelity, and sound.  And AKIRA reissued takes advantage of all these.
However,
One thing that makes me crazy about DVD -- the PUSH tab to release the disc from the case.  It's like unwrapping a shrink-wrapped CD, or VHS tape -- they're all different and they never work right.  Akira's PUSH tabs are particularly bothersome.

Most sci-fi movies tend to lose their bearing after about 10 years once technology and ""time"" catches up with it.  Akira is timeless and it's amazing it's taken this long for this movie to make a DVD appearance considering it's been on DVD in Japan for many years already.  It's interesting to see the opinions of those who are making comments about the new soundtrack and dubbing.  I come from the school of seeing Akira for the first time on this DVD, so, my opinion is limited to just this release.  I can't imagine why people are so critical about voice dubbing!  Are they high?  These people are not even commenting on the story, the animation or the characters for that matter-much less the DVD.  If they really take a hard look, it doesn't matter what kind of dubbing they use.  The story is what is important and Akira is foundationalized in great animation, outstanding direction, superb music with the movie still holding up as a superior product even to todays high tech CGI Hollywood fluff.
The story is quite good actually, Tetuso plays a rebel biker who is caught up in a government conspiracy that could cost him his life or perhaps his ""mind.""  With the help of his rebel gang friends and three spaced out children, Tetsuo must be saved from the brink of madness known as ""Akira""-a biogenetic monster that if unleashed will destroy mankinds existence and reverse the creation of the universe.  Can Tetsuo be saved?  You gotta buy the DVD to find out!
Like I said before, this DVD is the bomb!

The Special Edition vocals are a departure from the old vocals, and, as other reviewers here note, are not always an improvement. The translation is also subtly different, with fewer memorable lines. However the story is easier to understand at the same time. Both versions have their high and low points...
The DVD transfer, BTW, is flawless -- and the soundtrack on DVD (I had worn out my VHS type) is impressive with my 5-speaker Dolby Digital setup.
The movie also has some of the downsides of much Anime -- some characters are cardboard cutouts, the animation has moments of lameness that appear dated followed by beautiful, flowing chase scenes. And the movie does not always make perfect sense, but then, if you are watching a movie about people who can channel pure energy, why get technical?

As I have had the opportunity to own this film in three other incarnations, (Two VHS editions, and one laserdisc edition) this one is radically better than any before it. The difference in quality for picture and sound is immediately apparent on most any modest setup.
The NEW English language track that has been dubbed for the film is a MORE ACCURATE translation than the previously recorded dub. Strangely enough, some fans miss the OLD English dub track that was used on PREVIOUS releases despite the fact that it made an already dense plot more difficult to follow. The point seems almost moot, as most people would be best served by the movies original language track, Japanese, which can be found in this DVD.
Though much citicism has been levied against the film for it having too condensed a plot from its comic book counterpart, the film is (primarily) all about visual oooohs and ahhhs.

The story is too condensed and too unrewarding.
The English voice acting is the worst- and the script itself is a lot of name's screamed back and forth, yuck.  The children's voices are women scrunched up or something- it is bad.

We all loved the movie and thought it was amazing animation, but somewhat confusing the first time through.  Although after a second veiwing the movie became one of my favorites.  So when I saw it available on DVD I went out and snapped up a copy, as my old VHS copy was starting to get worn.  Although after the first 10 minutes of speaking I threw in the VHS to compare how different the translation was... it's ridiculous... I pulled the DVD and quickly returned it.  For example in the first scene in the bar when the first customer walks in in the original he is asked what he wants and responds, ""red bennies, three of them..."", the new version however contains the laughable line... ""give me peanuts, three of them..."". It only goes downhill from there.  I thought the original VHS versions voices fit the characters much better and would recommend to anyone, who like myself owns the original, DO NOT UPGRADE!  The DVD is a total disappointment.

It has the deepness of Ghost in the Shell, without the boring, unnecessary jabber that it consists of (I don't like Ghost in the Shell very much), and the extreme action of Princess Mononoke (which I like very much).  And despite what many people say, it is not that violent.  That's a good thing.  All-around, this is an excellent movie, with pretty good animation.  Oh! and the DVD.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of the DVD.  The picture looks as clear as can be and the sound is excellent.

629164,5,6303305520,"Bravo! The first time I saw Akira was in 1990. I was a boy in Japan, living as an Marine brat. I got my hands on a ... VHS copy from a friend, and I fell completely in love with it, even though I couldn't understand a single word.
The animation blew me away. It was revolutinary in its adult-based content. And it set the stage for a worldwide appreciation of Japan-imation.
The digital transfer is superb! The sound is first rate! Not only was the voiceover work re-done, but so were the sound effects. I can see how some people could become attached to the Orion release's pronunciation of names and voices. But having the true Japanese tilt to the read is a joy for the true fan....
To belittle the work done here is to show just how incapable a person is of appreciating the clean-up. This is the same kind of person who gets upset over remastering classic Hollywood movies so they can be appreciated as the director originally intended. This film has the original director's sanction. Can we assuredly say the Orion release did ?
The extras are worth the extra cash. They probably could have given us more detail, but they don't disappoint as an inside look at a true cult classic.

629166,5,6303305520,"A benchmark in animation and content, ""Akira"" is a science fiction production about a Neo-Tokyo teenager in the year 2019 who threatens to repeat an apocalyptic event that destroyed the metropolis thirty years earlier.  Tetsuo, a troubled motorcycle-gang member with an inferiority complex, crosses paths with a mysterious child from an ultra-secret government project code named Akira.  The encounter awakens Tetsuo to a force of biblical proportions, enticing him to uncover the secret of the government's program and cause mass destruction along the way.

There are numerous other characters in this story, but the major players are Kaneda, Kei, the Colonel, and the three children of the project.  Kaneda is Tetsuo's older friend and fellow gang-member who eventually confronts Tetsuo in a climatic battle.  Kei is the terrorist, drawing Kaneda's attention and presence into her plot to uncover the secrets of Akira. The Colonel is the commander of the project, and the only member of the government's executive council who understands the dangers of Akira.  Then there are the three children of the project who pool their gifts in an effort to stop Tetsuo from unleashing the destructive powers that have been kept in check for the past thirty years.

Written and directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, Akira is presented in animation of amazing detail and style, rivaled only by some of Hayao Miyazaki's features and Mamoru Oshi's ""Ghost in the Shell.""  Even more remarkable is the absence of computer animation, with exception of a few minor scenes, and the film done entirely by animators.  It's a staggering accomplishment, particularly when viewing the documentary feature on the second disk of the special edition package.  I've watched numerous American productions and none of them come close to the animation quality of this film.  The special edition features a new English dub production more loyal to the original Japanese script, painstakingly matched up with the oral movements of the characters' mouths (there's that kind of detail in this film), although arguably less entertaining than the original English dub.

The twin disk edition comes in an attractive tin container and features beautifully restored imagery.  There are still some imperfections that show up on the screen, but it far surpasses my old deteriorated VHS copy that I'm sure other Akira fans have had to tolerate up to now.  This is a ""must-have"" for Akira fans.  The film is geared for young adults, but many adult animation enthusiasts will find this an entertaining feature, but I do not recommend this for children due to several violent scenes, the film's graphic nature, and some brief nudity.",996969600,3,2679,5.212121212121212
629229,5,6303305520,"I saw this film when I was in my early teens, and found it interesting, but very confusing.  The earlier VHS dubs and subtitles were not translated in a way which led to being able to understand the plot.
I was a little worried that my tastes had changed so much that I wouldn't like Akira when it came out in July of 2001 with a remastered version.  How wrong I was.  The story is very subtle in places.  You are given only a hint of what a particular plotline tells, and it is left to the imagination to think of what might have occurred in the past.  The little moments are what is best in this film. The translation is head and shoulders above most that I've seen.  I watched the english dub along with subtitles to compare, and it is *very* close, no meaning lost at all.  A rare case where the dub actually gives a better experience than the subtitled version.
I have started reading the graphic novel, but it is a little bit more loose and jumpy than the film.  Many claim the graphic novel is supeior.  Like always, I am going against the grain and saying that the film is better - more is left to the imagination, and sometimes there is more depth in simplicity.
This is among the 5 best japanese animation films I have seen (which do not include Ninja Scroll).  Deceptively complex, politically intriguing, and philosophical, this film must be viewed multiple times to appreciate it.",996883200,,1393,4.427450980392157

629233,3,6303305520,"When I first heard that Akira was being re-released in DVD format I immediately rushed out and reserved a copy.  I counted down the days till my special collectors edition complete with a second disc packed full of extras, a new 5.1 digital sound track, and a digitally enhanced picture would arrive.  $ days ago it did, and I quickly popped it into the DVD player and got ready to see one of my favorite movies of all time redone and digitally enhanced.
I was let down
It seems some genius decided it would be better to rehash the old picture with new voice overs which not only consisted of new voices, but changed lines!  That's right, liberties were taken, and being the fan I am I decided to keep an open mind, however it got bad. The wonderfully synchronized voices of old were replaced by off key speaking, odd translation, and new pronunciation of character names.  Kaneda is referred to time and time again as Canada, and Akira is now pronounced Ahkeeda...now I understand that this might be the correct Japanese pronunciation, but for a long time fan of the ORIGINAL English version it makes watching almost unbearable by itself.  Combine that with the above mentioned and mix in a drowned out soundtrack (the beautiful background music in the clown gang fight scene is barely noticeable anymore) and you have a prime example of what happens when you try to bring a classic picture ""up to date"" as the crew puts it in one interview.
On to the good points.
The video quality is FAR superior to the original, and the 2 disc set is PACKED full of extras that are a fine edition for any Akira fan.  The full Japanese version is also available to see (If only they would have thrown the 1988 English version as well) as well as full subtitles, and a cool ""capsule"" option that pops a pill onto screen prompting you to hit enter whenever a sign, or other image appears in Japanese so you can get an English translation...very cool.
In summary, without the extras I would have rated this version much lower, but with the beautiful picture, and all the add ins it's worth owning....just be sure to watch in the original Japanese with English subtitles and save yourself the horror of watching one of the greatest animes of all time reduced to lines about crack smokers, and out of place name calling.",996796800,,2302,4.575242718446602

Come, on how would you like it if the voice of Darth Vadar of Star Wars was changed?

When the limited addition finally arrived I was instantly thrilled with the fantastic packaging efforts in the design, look and feel. The collector tin and booklets were superb. Loaded with extras this DVD was ready to go. But if you are a fan of the original movie release many years ago the new release FALLS SHORT! The images color and sound are impeccable but low and behold our lovely American studio decided to RERECORED the American voice over. The character choice mood and all around flow of the movie is INTOLLERABLE at least! The voices have become bubble gum in comparison. ALL DRAMATIC VOICE ACTING LOST!! The original voice over, overseen by the actual creator of the move by the way, had so much more. It delivered an intense portrayal of just a glimpse of what the Japanese language could provide, while the new over-dubbing is COLD, UNINTERESTING and OBVIOUS.

In japanese with subtitles was better than the different and confusing story told in the previous english dubbing. I think the story would now make sense to someone who has only watched it once.  The characters themselves even changed in the previous english version. This version changes the characters to something much closer to how they are intended to be, at least how they are in the comics and japanese version.  They actually speak full sentances now! No doubt, I will miss the ""C'mon, ... dammit"", but i guess you can't have everything.  I think the new version is better, in almost all aspects.  There is little debate that the colors are brighter and clearer.  There is less dirt on this cut.  The sound is remixed in dolby 5.1 . And you can hear the difference, I have heard better mixes, but this is one of the best.  Too bad it wasn't done in DST, which in my opinion is considerably better.

And now that I am much older, I can understand clearly the metaphysical theme Akira presents.  Although I like the theme that all life-form has the potential to use the genetically recorded knowledge gained since the beginning of creation, the storytelling and animation is even more awesome...I think representing power of knowledge as a form of psychic power opened up endless possibilities of exciting sequences.... The film definitely took good advantage of the concept to make the story entertaining as well as intellectually stimulating...
And this DVD....with loads of extra on the 2nd disc...well... This is the best DVD I own so far...with Ghost in the Shell in the second place....
Now only if Bladerunner is released at such quality and quantity as Akira....Then...I would be a very happy person to invest in DVD technology....This is a WARNNING...Do not purchase the Bladerunner DVD that is currently available...I own it, and no matter how much I like Bladerunner...I am disgusted by the DVD release...",996451200,,1199,5.11734693877551

I have been a major fan of this film, but I will look for one of the original versions to add to my collection.  They also altered the amazing musical score.

The artwork looks outstanding, but the new dubbing (although it is a more exact translation) is horrible.  Most notably the voice acting.  The actors are the worst I have heard in a long time.  It sounds like they are reading their script to you not acting.  The actors were also miss cast, the voice tones don't match the faces with the exception of Kei.
If you enjoyed the origonal dubbed version the dubbing in this one is going to make your stomach churn.  If you can get a copy of the 1989 letterbox version dubbed I would suggest it.  The dubbed voice acting is outstanding in that version.
The capsule modes are neat and if you prefer Subtitles anyway (I generally do but just happen to be fond of the origonal release of this movie) I would recommend it.  But don't be fooled by the promise of the re-done dubbing it is sad, almost shameful.",996451200,,1058,4.38974358974359
629277,5,6303305520,"""Akira"" is not my favorite anime movie by any stretch of the imagination--that title would have to go to ""Mononoke Hime""/""Princess Mononoke,"" the greatest accomplishment of anime's greatest film director, Miyazaki Hayao.  But there is no way that Miyazaki's imagination, as expansive, intelligent, and vivid as it is, could ever come up with something as visually and aurally striking as Otomo Katsuhiro's ""Akira.""
First, even with a five star review, ""Akira"" in terms of contents has some storytelling problems--the oft-noted fact that there were thousands of manga pages to condense into a two-hour film production obviously did not help in clarifying the story, especially for newcomers to anime and manga.  However, I am happy to report that the new dub and subtitling job has made many elements much clearer than the old Streamline release.  The explanation of the psychic powers in the children and the ending have been clarified a great deal, though not entirely (the movie simply couldn't condense the manga that much).
Also, contrary to most of the reviewers who have panned the new dub, I personally can't see on any technical standard how the old dub is in any way superior to the new one, which I found a lot less irritating and overacted.  I actually do agree, however, that they might have added the old dub as an extra audio track for nostalgia's sake and it would add to the value of this already excellent package.  ""Akira"" was the first anime to become popular in the mainstream American culture, and so perhaps the memories of those early fans should have been taken into consideration.  Nevertheless, I don't consider it a huge loss, especially since the dub is definitely clearer in explaining the story and is more accurate.  (Me?  I still prefer subtitles, of course. :)
The storytelling problems I mentioned above, however, definitely are overwhelemed by the fantastic visuals, of which just about every reviewer has spoken.  The video restoration on the DVD is nothing less than astounding, considering the film's age.  Details like tiny lamps and desks in the thousands of lighted office windows are now clear.  The hyperkinetic racing sequences are even more glorious in their energy than before, as the colors have been restored and the dark color palette, which made VHS releases look fuzzy and muted, is now sharp and distinct.  The soundtrack is one of the most thrilling and innovative ethnic soundtracks used in film, anime or not, and it too has been digitally restored.
""Akira"" is an absolute aesthetic triumph in anime, and despite its less-than-perfect storytelling qualities (and, for me, excessive bloodletting), it is the defining visual statement of what cel animation can accomplish.  The DVD release also sets a new standard in audio/video quality and also in the wealth of informational material included on the Special Edition's second DVD--for me, it was a fascinating first peek at the actual production of a feature anime.  First, ""Mononoke"" set THE standard for quality audio/video transfer, though it lacked in extras and was a recent film in either case; now, ""Akira"" takes my top spot for technical and aesthetic excellence for a Region 1 anime DVD release.",996364800,,3209,5.076045627376426

And maybe that is why I gave the DVD version 2 of 5 stars.  The video, to me, looks no different.  A little brighter in some areas.  Some of the new sounds are good, but not much more then that.  My biggest problem is the new dialog.  I can't stand the sound of these chumps.  I couldn't watch the movie after hearing the sound of some of the characters.  They took the voice of kaneda that sounded like an overconfident punk and turned hmm into some confused kid.  It probably would sound better if every character was voiced by Eddie Izzard, at least then it would be a comedy.  They need to put out a dvd version that has the old dialog on it.  I have yet to watch the dvd all the way through, instead I watch a little bit then throw in the vhs to keep my sanity.  So imho if you are looking to buy Akira, I would get a vhs and hope it is the old dialog or can be returned.  Then again, if you don't own Akira yet, you probably won't care much....",996364800,2,1113,4.0228310502283104
629281,5,6303305520,"The new digitally mastered version of Akira is truely a masterpiece in the making.  The picture looks better than ever its crisp and clear with absolutely no blurs!!  It totally blows away the old VHS, Laserdisc, and VCD versions of it!  Most people were upset by the fact that the movie has been Re-Dubbed but my opinion is that the new dub is in fact better than the original.  First of all in the original Dub many things were not stated very clearly due to poor translating such as the jail scene where the Canada and the girl (forgot her name) were in the prison and she was explaining the subject of Akira.  In the original version it was very unclear what she was trying to say and many people were confused saying ""Huh what in the world is she talking about"".  In the newly dubbed version everything totally makes sense!  So if you are one of the many Anime fans who saw Akira originally I stongly suggest you to buy the newly remastered version of Akira and if you can try to get this limited edition because it comes in a killer tin case and has a second dsic with a ton of suplimental extras.  But if you cant the regular re-release is still cool.",996278400,,1158,4.328703703703703

Movie - I think it's greate, and I'm not talking only about contents but also about copy. Menus are great (but I think sounds of bike are cuting sometimes) and movie looks so good. On secound DVD we've got lots of stuff, but I think the most interested is movie about how they made it. And I think that's all and don't forget about special tin box.

629353,5,6303305520,"The 2-disc DVD set of AKIRA surpasses in many ways even the excellent Criterion's laserdisc edition from 1992.  The brand-new video transfer is noticeably better: colors, especially the primary reds and greens, look more brilliant, flesh tones are more realistic, and there is a bit MORE picture at the bottom (in particular, the shot at time 1:16:23 reveals part of Kaneda's crouching body that was not seen on old transfers).  The 5.1 English track, though not state of the art, is highly active and satisfying.  The new English dub and subtitles are better written and spoken, making the characterizations more real and the story more comprehensible.  In the scene where the colonel meets the senator (Chapter 8), the old English dub had the senator sounding concerned and supportive.  On the new dub, he sounds cold and indifferent, in keeping with his subsequent body gesture of fiddling with his plants.  The new dub also has characters speaking in correct pitches -- Kei's voice is now lower, and Masaru no longer sounds like an old man, but like a child, just like on the Japanese track.  Also welcomed are the correct pronunciations of Japanese names: AH-kee-ra, KAH-nee-dah, KAH-oh-ri.  Last but not least, the new dub makes more frequent uses of strong language to enhance reality.  The DVD supplements include interviews of the voice actors for the new dub, who certainly deserve to be mentioned.
Here is one thing that this DVD pales in comparison to the Criterion LD.  The LD included still-frames of the entire first issue of the original Akira comic novel.  It is a shame that this DVD does not include even one screen shot of the actual comic strips that inspired this movie (it does include shots of the COVERS of the comic novels) just to benefit those who have never seen them or do not own the LD.
Other DVD supplements include an excellent 48-minute making-of documentary (the Criterion LD had excerpts of it).  It has plenty of behind-the-scenes footage: artists drawing pencil tests, actors recording their lines, musicians composing a score with wood xylophones, photographers taking shots of finished ""cels"".  We are told that it was not the norm in Japanese animation films to record the dialogs before drawing the pictures, as it was done for AKIRA.  The youthful director Katsuhiro Otomo appears in his own 30-minute interview segment (not on the LD), where he recalls various processes of making the Akira comics and the Akira movie, and speculates on what he will do next.  Yet another half-hour segment, ""Akira Sound Clips"", explains how the movie's score was conceptualized and recorded.  The most prized supplement on the DVD is perhaps the mammoth collection of the film's storyboards, character designs, and background designs.  The storyboards, done by Otomo himself, are the most meticulously designed ones I've ever seen; each of them is denoted with Scene/Cut number (under ""S"" and ""C"" on the left), notes, dialogs, and time of duration of the shot.  To help locating a storyboard among the 4500 of them, the printed chapter index is cross-referenced with Scene/Cut numbers of its corresponding storyboards.  Rather disappointing is a short featurette that tersely describes the new video transfer of the DVD with only interviews of 3 technicians and no demonstration of the restoration by way of before-and-after comparisons.
There is also an interesting feature called ""capsule option"".  When it is enabled, a capsule icon pops up on the screen from time to time while the movie is playing, and when you activate the icon, the screen pauses and shows you English text translation of the Japanese words on the screen -- traffic signs, graffitis, postings, etc.",996278400,2,3701,5.055921052631579

Akira takes place in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, Bike gangs rule the streets and Incompetent committee members run everything else.  After a motorcycle accident, a 16-year-old gang member named Tetsuo discovers his hidden powers.  As the movie goes on, we find out what happens when the wrong person gets pushed around too much.  All hell breaks loose, and the only person who can stop it is Tetsuo's best friend, Kaneda.
All in all, this movie is almost too good to be true, however, you might want to keep younger children away from this movie for a while, it is extremely violent and has one scene of brief nudity.  This ain't pokemon.",996192000,,828,4.7622377622377625

Ofcourse i bought the special edition tin can(being a fanatic isn't easy.) Everything is awsom they totally went all out on restoring the movie to its original state. But here is where my fanatic mind has uncovered something strange. On the 2nd disc with all the special features there is a feature about the restoration process, they talk about removing dirt and these white spots which occur with time?(im not fully sure), well anyways they go on saying how they have removed all those white specks and dirt so that the movie is nice and smooth...WRONG!!!!!!!!! They missed some of those spots which kinda sucks because here i am dishing out cash for something that was supposed to be well perfected.b.s. i HOPE i'M not the only one who noticed this...the spots occur towards the end of chapter 17 right when they enter the sewers and also towards the end of the movie.please e-mail me if you see it or not.

Buy this and watch this excellent movie that flabergasted audiences 10 years ago and is back to show just how good the best really was. The story is a bit complicated at times, but don't despair, watch it again and then maybe if your still in doubt, you can look fro some info online to help mesh out the manga based story that is a bit much for only a 2 hour movie.

Anime junkie that I am, I decided it was the best thing since leavened bread.  As soon as Streamline released the videotape I went and bought it, played it again and again.  Even if the dialogue was a little (okay, /really/) stilted in places.  Even if there were some mistranslations.  Even if things went on in the background that made no sense at all.  I wore that tape out.  But now . . . The voice actors are better cast.  The sound effects are beefed up.  The color is better.  The dialogue is smoother.  Explanations are cleverly worked into the script.  It's grittier, uglier, scarier, more ecstatic, more wondrous.  I just can't say enough good things about this movie.

A must for anime fans. My complaint is only that Pioneer pulls a Disney in the fact that you have to pay extra money for things that should be standard. 15 bucks more for some stills and production comments is not good business. Disney did it with it's Toy Story and Fantasia box sets,charging 60 bucks or more for thing they should give away for buying the DVD. That's the reason people buy DVDs in the first place. to get all the things most VHS movies doesn't have like trailers and documentries. instead you pay extra for these things. Gladiator was a example of a great deal for under 25 bucks. you got all the extras included. Not paying an extra 15 bucks for a few trailers and some comentary. that's just Companies price gouging  because of pure greed.

Akira is one of no more than 15 movies ever made that successfully manages to pull all of them together into a stunning film that is not only a feast for eyes and ears, but for the mind. Repeated viewings don't just develop further appreciation -- they will spur more questions in your mind and your imagination.

Unfortunately The 1st Movie disc won't play in my player (JVC XV-D701!) So I will have to return the movie.  I was able to see the second supplimental disc, and it was cool, lots and lots of storyboards and other art, well worth it.  And the Trailers, and advertising poster art.  A lot of love was put in to the disc.
You can't call yourself an anime fan if you haven't seen this movie.  It defines anime, it is how anime should be, bring back the frames of animation per second to this level please!

To re-arrange one person's very admirable review: ""It takes a very open mind to enjoy this movie.  Akira draws fanatics too bloodthirsty to appreciate its message, and scares away critics intelligent enough to understand it.  All in all, be careful with this movie; it's not for everyone.  Just ignore the hype on BOTH sides (pro and con) and judge for yourself.""
While this film condenses a long pre-existing manga (comic book) storyline, the movie's plot may seem ""chunked together"" at times.  The film is filled with gritty violence to appease the blood-and-guts fans while they have ""some morality shoved down their throats"".
The new DVD picture quality is ""heads and shoulders"" above that of the original VHS/LD/VCD version.  The film negative has been digitally cleaned up to remove scratches and dirt.  The colors are so vivid and rich in this version.  The picture actually looks BETTER than it would have when the film was brand new (in a theater in 1988).
This version's picture may be the most vivid, rich and colorful animation work I have ever seen.  This DVD version looks and sounds the way every version of Akira should.
I would highly recommend this version to any and all Akira fans.  I would highly recommend this title to anime or science  fiction fans, but simply recommend it to everyone else.

I bought it yesterday only to bring it home and have my DVD player reject it - repeatedly.  My DVD player is a JVC and can play DVD's, Video-CD's, and CD-ROM's with region 1 encoding, and it plays all of my other DVD's (about 200 of them) just fine, but will not play Akira.
I took it back and exchanged it for another one off the shelf, picked at random, and that one wouldn't play either.  My DVD player is about 2 years old, that's the only thing I can think of that might explain it, maybe there's some kind of new technology on this DVD that the technical specs don't talk about.  There certainly isn't any information about such a thing on the packaging.  It just don't play.
So enjoy the DVD with caution.  Almost all of the reviews I've read about the DVD so far are dated before it was actually available (7/24/2001), so keep in mind that a lot of these people hadn't actually bought and played the DVD at the time.

I admit, I was a little young when I first saw it, back in 1989 when it was released on video. Akira was awesome and my first anime since such U.S. conversions as StarBlazers and Robotech.  It's very much a strong story with great art.  The motorcycle scenes are so cool, with the light trails...  The whole secret experiment element is still prevalent in today's stories...  Back in the day, THIS was the anime that all strived to be like. Unfortunately, there is one major problem.  The voice acting isn't nearly as convincing as in the original!  Kaneda and his group don't sound like teenage punks.  And the dialogue has been changed (tweaked here and there) just enough to throw us older types off.  Apparently, Pioneer was trying to get the dialogue closer to the original story, which doesn't always work. I'm glad I only bought the movie and not the special edition.  In any case, this is an anime that should be in your collection because this was a pioneer anime.  And remember, this was BEFORE Ghost in the Shell or Princess Monoke.

629498,5,6303305520,"(Ok briefly a small rant. If you are going to review a DVD please include comments about the quality of the disc.) If you are reading this you probably have already seen Akira and enjoy it. The question that I am tackling is... Is the DVD worth it? The answer is definately. A lot of care went into the restoration of this film and it shows. The film went through three seperate processes just for the image alone. The image quality is far better than watching the old murky streamline Vhs version. Akira is the perfect example of what the medium of vhs can not handle. Vhs is incredibly poor with dark or colorful images. If the image is dark like much of Akira is the picture will have  alot of grain because Vhs can't display different hues of black well. The same is true for color except instead of grain they bleed all over the place.  DVD was created to handle high contrast pictures with dark blacks and bright saturated colors. The backgrounds show so much more color and depth that it almost like see the film again for the first time. The audio is also a stellar 5.1 track. The new dub is more consice and flows better than the one on the one streamline did. In short the movie alone is worth the price of admission. Now on to the extras. The extras are thankfully on a second disc. The extras are a mixed bag. There are tons of interesting bits of information, but they are presented in such a dry fashion that you won't care. The image gallerys are nice and have everything from story boards to comic covers. The other good extra is the glossary of terms that help you understand the complexity of the movie. Two last things the menus are fantastic and so is the packaging of the disc in the tin. If you are an Akira fan do yourself a favor and buy the limited edition.",996019200,,1782,4.332335329341317

As soon as I heard they were finally releasing it on DVD in English, I pre-ordered the special collector's edition.
The movie is still as vicious and beautiful as I remember, and I'm so glad to have it anamorphic on DVD.  I do miss the old dialogue though.  Memorized from repeated viewings, the movie seems incomplete without lines like, ""What are you waiting for???"" ""Then I won't tell him what's it in, huh?"" and so on.  I even miss the voices I remember from the old dubbing.  I wish they would have added an audio track that went with the old version... if they had done that, then this DVD would be everything an Akira fan could hope for.

They rerecorded the voices to better match the original script. But I liked the first voices better even though most people didn't. I don't know...I guess I have watch the first version of Akira so many times the voices grew on me. They even pronounced the names differently from the first version. Kaneda's name sounds more like ""Canada"" in this version. But I guess that's how it was pronounced in the Japanese version. I'm sure these new voices will have grown on me after the 500th time I've watched this DVD. That's about how many times I've watch the VHS. Which is why I needed the DVD.

Art: The painstaking detail they put in it is nothing short of incredible. Akira's cell animation gives many of todays CGI a run for it's money
Music: Fitting and really get's the blood pumping at action scenes
It also a bit tamer than most other anime out there...which could be bad or good depending on how you look at it.
Nudity/sex: Virtually non-existant.  Only one VERY brief scene showing a womans chest area compared to the continuous and rather uneccessary nudity of...let's say...Ghost in the Shell.
Violence/Gore: It definately has it's share, but it's kept as realistic as possible. It's not the 100's of gallons of blood under extreme high pressure just waiting to rain down and turn everything red like...let's say...Ninja Scroll.
It takes a healthy attention span, but it's not too hard to follow...at least as far as anime goes. Over all, it's a very solid animation.",995932800,,1135,4.815384615384615

Just got mine today, and only watched about half an hour, just to see. I have to say, my first impression... the voices are all wrong. Not all of them, and some of the lines are better, I'd admit, but there's something missing in this new dub. Examples: where the 1st test subject we see screams and the glass explodes? the new dub is missing some of the extra echo scream in that scene and boy, does it make a difference. Also, the voice for the 2nd test subject, the one in the wheel chair, sounds too much like Ralph Wiggum from the Simpsons. I really wish they'd included the original dub on here, even if it meant dumping the Japanese language track. That's probably sacrilegious to some, but I'd rather see this wonderful film the way I remember... and really, with all the potential of DVD, why not have them all, for all tastes? This release suffers from the new dub, I have to say. Looks great, but missing the great original voices... too bad.",995932800,,1101,4.349514563106796

If this was to be such a hell-bent collector's edition, the JAPANESE version should be in 5.1, and there should have been TWO versions in english (new and ORIGINAL dub), which could have just been in mono for all we care.  Hell, some movies have 3 language selections... they could have even made the disks 2 sided.  I'm sorry, the new dub ....  The actors (and translated lines) are VERY trite and unemotional (like your typical BAD anime), and I personally LOVE the lines added in the original English dub (ie first scene: ""Red bennies... three of 'em.."", ""You got a bad attitude pops!  Lighten up before your arteries harden!"").  This was probably done to match the subtitles, which is stupid, since two sets of subtitles could have been made; or three for that matter, like one in Japanese.  Then there's the extras disk.  You know, I LOVE it when I can't get a display on the remaining/total time on the extra features... and this is a rapidly spreading disease on many new DVDs.  It infects half the extras disk.  Also, weren't there American trailers of any sort?  I SWEAR I've seen an English trailer before.  Probably because it was the original dub.  The other complaint on the extras disk is that it has a ridiculously large amount of pictures from the comics (which are all THE EXACTLY SAME LOOKING), and almost no pix of other collectibles (my t-shirt and soundtrack are NOT listed).

A second disc features a detailed production report, sound clips, an interview with writer, designer, director Katsuhiro Otomo and more.

I thought I was going to split the discs but thankfully I didn't. The special features on the second disc are good.

It was almost like I was watching it for the first time again. Hats off to the production team that created this well, masterpiece. I couldn't really see the detail in the VHS copy but from the foreground, background and the character animations, this is ALL cell animation! Very little CG! Very, very high quality work here. The story is deep and complex so be ready to be confused watching this for the first time. There are so many different smaller stories and plot twists going on that it can be hard to keep up with on your first sitting. The english dubbed soundtrack is remastered in Dolby 5.1 and was done very well considering that this movie is over 10 years old now. Purists beware since new foley has been added in addition to the original mix and none of the voice actors are the same as in the VHS english dubbed version. Gunfire and explosions were most prominent to me on the first viewing as sounding different and there are additional foley effects added but I liked it. I thought it hightened the realism and why not take advantage of all the improvements that current technology has to offer? This is an excellent film for those interested in grown up, in depth storytelling and you can't help but wonder if our government is doing similar experiments (I doubt with children) to bring out the powers of the mind.

The new dubbing isn't offal but I enjoy the original dubbing far better.  If they already had the dubbing available, how hard could it have been to include a choice to hear that too?

On the technical side of you have some of the most stunning animation ever made.  Not only that but lovingly restored and looking better than ever, THX certified.  One Star.
Sound effect were hollywood action movie quality, and music was highly original, and has not aged like some soundtracks or scores do.  One star.
Like Blade Runner before it, Akira is a film that has changed cinema.  Though felt more in animation, Akira still has had an impact in  mainstream films.  For that reason, that it is piece of history, it should be recognized.  People that attack it, saying that it's over hyped, we should ask them if they like Star Wars.  SW should get credit for it's cultural impact, regardless of objective quality, and so their point is moot.  Bad or good, genius or flawed, it has changed people.  One more star.

I downloaded a 218 MB asf version of this movie from the net because i could not find the VHS in stores, or in rental places. So i downloaded it. TERRIBLE quality, sound, etc. But, the movie itself, was truely amazing. Combined with good action, cool futuristic bikes, and plot. Along with pretty good anime for the 1980's. I thought the movie was amazing. In fact, I plan on ordering this DVD. The original one released by ORION apparently was not all that good (the one i saw). Apparently with the Pioneer release, they have re-done the entire thing. They cleaned up the video really nice, and they also re-dubbed it. Also, i heard that they translated all of the grafiti in the backshots. So that's quite a bit of work. Considering Pioneer did all of this within the 6 month area. I recommend you buy this DVD. If you liked Ghost in the Shell, theres no way you'll dislike this movie. In MY opinion, this movie is wayyy better than ghost in the shell.

As an ex-anime fan (I quit watching once I moved to Japan oddly enough) I can still pop this in and enjoy this mesmorizing, subliminal cult classic - even enough to warrant buying a Hong Kong hack version DVD, with AWFUL subtitles.
One should hesitate to call this an anime, for more than a few reasons.  At a time I could have easily qualified as otaku, I welcomed obvious elements of this film that you would not find in other movies.  Among them are:
-The *BEST* soundtrack in any animated feature, by Geinoh Yamashirogumi (who I'm seeing in Tokyo next month!!).  Phenominal, percussion-heavy organic tracks, befitting each scene.  A true masterpiece.  Cheers to Otomo for not hiring some ..., Japanese pop band like EVERY other anime-producer does.  If you like the music, hunt down their other stuff-  Ecophony: Gaia is incredible.
-A story open for imagination and interpretation
-No cheese
Things you will NOT find in this feature that are in most animes
-... tunes that are basically regurgitated 80's music with todays technology
-scantilly clad babes with guns bigger than a tank
-Cheese

629566,4,6303305520,"As a kid I was brought up on Disney and WB fare, but a Japanese friend took me to see Akira at a cinema in Scotland in 1989.  Compared with Western products, the incredible depth and quality of Akira's animation left me open-mouthed.  Naturally Western animation has moved on since then, using computer generated characters and scenes, and has closed the ""agog"" factor somewhat.  That's the reason for 4 stars and not 5.
Fortunately I understand this DVD has the Japanese soundtrack.  I've seen both the dubbed version and the original (I have the VHS version).  The original is far, far superior.  This is supposed to be a Japanese movie, with Japanese characters, and  Japanese culture, set in Tokyo.  Watch it in Japanese and use the English subtitles.  Even if you don't understand what they're saying, the tones and pitch of the voices, and the speed of speech, are all channels of communication from the director.
I agree with one of the previous reviewers that on your first viewing you will probably come away rather confused.  I admit my recommendation to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles will not aid comprehension.  But so what if you need 2 viewings.  Surely that's the whole point of buying a DVD: you can watch it again for free.
In conclusion, if you only ever watch one Japanese anime, watch this one.  And you're better off buying than renting as you'll need, and want, more than one viewing.",993772800,16,1420,4.746938775510204

629642,5,6303305520,"This movie is a masterpiece. I am a major anime fan, and this is my favorite anime. It is my favorite movie really. This is the reason why anime became so popular in America in the first place, and I can see why. It tells the story of Tetsuo and Kaneda. They were childhood friends, yet Kaneda always protected Tetsuo. This got Tetsuo pissed, because he didn't want a reputation as a wimp. Tetsuo has a motorcycle accident when he runs ahead of the other gang members to chase a member of the  Clowns (One of the rival gangs). Government officials airlift him away, and experiment with him. From these experiments he gains psychic powers.......
The animation is unique, and wonderful. Not like most of the animation in Nickelodeon, (Those make me puke!) and most American cartooons. The movie makes you think as well. It is chock full of symbolism. The story is original, and progresses without boring you. The characters are all individual, and you hate your bad guys(I can't stand the rabbit-toothed midget who died of a heart attack), unlike most animes which in them, the coolest characters are the bad guys(Not that that's a bad thing ^-^).
Even if you are not an anime fan, you'll love it. My favorite fight scenes were the ones on motorcycles. If you want more Akira knowledge, I recommend the manga, which is much longer. It has been said that this anime is extremly violent, but it is not. I have seen a ton of real movies that are more violent. America is just used to cartoons being for kids, and the rating companies tend to exaggerate.
I feel sorry for Tetsuo, and Kaori at the end (Stupid meddling mutant kids had to interfere, and Tetsuo could have been the most powerful being in the universe), and it is kind of sad.
Also recommended, Ninja Scroll, Princess Mononoke, Blood Reign: Curse of the Yoma, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Those are all great animes.",991612800,3,1873,4.641566265060241
629643,3,6303305520,"I caught the remastered version of Akira on a digital projector in Burbank a few weeks back.  I am a huge fan of the original release of Akira.  It is by far one of, if not the most amazing works of animation ever created.  Five stars.  I caught it on the big screen back in the early 90's and it forever changed my visual perception.
I must say that the newly recorded dialogue and script is, by and large, a waste of effort.  The new print is beautiful, colors are glowing, as saturated as they have ever been.  I also noticed myself gazing at some new details in the shadows that were brought out by the new print.  Although the new hi-fi sounds ie. explosions and glass shattering are impressive, I found my stomach turning at how the lines were butchered by voice actors who didn't seem to characterize the various players in the story very well.  The voices of Kaneda and Tetsuo, who would seem most important, are just not there.  Kaneda's voice is not authorative or interesting enough, and Tetsuo's voice is lacking in intensity.  The Colonel's voice is nowhere near the original actor's entertaining delivery.  Down the line, all the actors just fail to capture the original spirit.  They chose to go with younger actors to play the three numbered experiments, not just for Takashi.  This was an interesting choice, but again, they lack ""screen presence"" in an audio sense.  If you have seen the original, you might find it slightly irritating that they pronounce ""Kaneda"" with a soft ""Kah-nehda"", which is proper Japanese pronunciation, but the original pronunciation just sounds cooler phonetically anyways.  Oh well.
As a writer, I have plenty to deride about the reworking of the script.  It adds very little in the way of story.  The entire rewrite is essentially Akira: the Thesaurus Script.  Replace every combination of words with another set of gramatically correct, but unusual responses in a situation where the original dialogue would've fit.  The cliche that applies in this case is if ain't broke, don't fix it.

629648,5,6303305520,"AKIRA is the benchmark Japanese animated film, instilling an intelligence and uncharacteristic adult element into the false world of cell animation. The results are breathtaking. Each bit of trash, each shard of glass, each drop of sweat is amazingly animated, giving AKIRA a highly realistic, yet fantastical, look and feel. Set in post-World War 3 Tokyo, AKIRA tells the story of two boyhood friends who become entangled in a government experiment to harness the power of the human lifeforce, an attempt to speed up the human evolution. One of these friends, a young and mistreated boy named Tetsuo, finds himself the unwilling guinea pig in these experiments. He developes strong telekinetic powers and sets out to seek revenge upon those who have put him down and made him feel inferior. All this strong emotional material is set against a chaotic backdrop of a city in the midst of revolution. Protests and terriorist bombings sparks the streets, sidewalk preachers scream out their gospel, all while the government and the army fight to keep control. It's strong stuff, aimed at adults, with oodles of violence and true, thought-provoking questions. The ending is a bit convoluted for most, highly reminescent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001, but nothing can quite ruin the 100 minutes that preceed it. What transpires is a work of art that is extremely fascinating and genuinely exciting. This is a startling example of the power of animation and deserves to be viewed as a true film and not just a cartoon. But this is for thinking audiences only. DOn't expect any talking bunnies. Do expect a massive adrenaline rush.",990662400,6,1620,5.048507462686567

I've been waiting for this for an excrutiatingly long time and a minor mistake (yeah right, who am I kidding) like this isn't going to detter me.  Still I am very disappointed.  Obviously the movie itself is of such enormous awesomeness I can't even describe it (esp. any better than the previous reviewers who did an excellent job).  All I can say is please buy this movie if you buy one movie in your entire existance and watch it many many times.  You will not regret it.  Definetely a tremendous landmark in the history of all animation and still the single best animation movie of all time (yes i do enjoy some of the older Disney movies but there is just no comparison).  If you have this movie and need a good anime fix, please also acquire Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke, Grave of the Fireflies, and Ninja Scroll (these are in order from best to not so best since all are amazing and of course this is only my opinion but I'm sure you'll agree after watching each one).",990576000,2,1421,4.376425855513308

The cels are dazzling, and nothing has even approached the minute detail of this film, and it was made in the late Eighties! If you HAVE seen the initial English dub released around 1990, then you are in for an interesting ride because this is a completely different film. The dialogue is not only done by new actors, but nearly every line is changed from the previous dub. One obvious change is pronuciations of the character's names: ""Akira"" isn't ""uh-KEE-ruh,"" as in the first English dub. Now, it's pronounced, ""AH-kee-dah,"" with the DAH spoken as a hard ""R."" Kaneda isn't ""kah-NAY-dah,"" but ""KAH-nah-dah."" It takes a bit of getting used to if you've seen the original English dub as many times as I have, but it's still a classic piece of animation that can still blow your mind every bit as much as it did in 1990. I recommend this version, although since I am still very much fond of the previous version, I would have liked it if they included the first English dub in a separate audio track. But alas, I am just grateful to see ""Akira"" back on the market so that anime fans, new and old, can continue to appreciate this master work.",990403200,,1298,4.527659574468085
629769,5,6303305520,"In America, we tend to think of animated films as cartoons. The Disney imprint comes to mind first, and for some that is the extent of it. For more serious devotees, the infamous Warner Brothers works, the Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson comedic less-than-one reelers are held in equal esteem with Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd.
Several films require a different way of thinking about animation as an art form: Rock and Rule (long out of print), Fantastic Planet, Light Years, the brilliant failure of the first Heavy Metal, and yes, both versions of Fantasia.
Akira is in a class by itself.
This film is the reason I wanted a DVD player. More than The Cell, The Matrix or Dark City. More than Welles's films, or Hitch's, or even Kurosawa's.
This film is proof that cgi's are not the be-all and end-all of the animated film.

Anyone who has seen it will understand how this makes sense.

It defines animation in the way that ""Watchmen"" defines comic books, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" defines science fiction, or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" defines wuxia, as something to strive for and not quite achieve.  It is a watermark.
That's some pretty flowery praise, but ""Akira"" deserves it.  Inside this movie is some of the best, most crisp and exiting animation ever captured on film.  There are so many stunning moments (the battle with the clowns, the sewer race, Tetsuo's battle with the army, Kaneda's race to save his friend, the background of Neo-Tokyo) backed up with an exceptional soundtrack that blends techno music with traditional Japanese styles.  The story line is traditional anime, with an explosive mixture of youth and technology juxtaposed with the traditional need to impose order on chaos.  The characters are both righteous and stupid, heroic and annoying, competent and naive. Ah heck, just watch it!

Anyone would just buy this DVD for merely the movie but there are many treats to add to it. Now there are two options, a oringinal English subbed version or a newly dubbed English version for you people that hated the first translation. This new dub follows almost word for word of the original script. The footage is a totally new transfer from the original movie negative (probably the second best transfer compared to a digital transfer) which means clarity, clarity, clarity! THX now supports the movie adding more to the already awesome soundtrack and effects. So DVD's charge for a lot for a 2 disc DVD and on one disc is susually the movie and the second extra stuff. In the past the extra stuff has been [less than amusing]...This however gives numerous extras that could bring tears to anyone's eyes. It contains ""The Making of Akira"", An interview with the director and writers, and much more. The price is right, the goodies are great and the movie is legendary...what more could you ask for from a DVD? I highly recommend you buy this fine work of art and enjoy it for many years.

I expected another re-run of some crappy anime, but it didn't matter to me.  Rather, I discovered they were playing a movie I had never heard of, Akira.  From the beginning to the end, I was glued to my seat.  I even watched the commercials with attentiveness because I was afraid I would miss it when it came back on.  Because it was on t.v. it had been shortened and was missing a lot of the graphic detail in this movie, which is very generous.  I therefore rented it and watched it three times that day.  This is a very graphic movie, involving generous blood and some nudity.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best Anime I have ever seen.  So what are waiting for?!  Go rent it!",988934400,,812,4.180645161290323
629830,5,6303305520,"Let me clarify that: I am not talking about the soft-core porno-violence that defines a lot of modern anime and manga. Rather, I'm speaking to the idea that Akira is a mature, intelligent film, written, animated and meant for mature, intelligent audiences -- the sort of people who understand that you have to eat your veggies before you get to have your ice cream. Akira is a substantial ""meal"" of a film, and it makes practically every other animated film (the Disney studio's ""product"" films in particular) seem about as nutritious as a candy bar. Not that there's anything wrong with that; it's just that sometimes you want a little bit more than bad ""feel-good"" rewrites of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Victor Hugo, you know what I mean? Akira serves that need quite well. Set in 21st-century Neo-Tokyo, ""31 years after World War III"", the film is a twisting, turning, dark and feverish science-fantasy story. The characters are intelligently-created, the symbolism and subtext are thought-provoking but not intrusive; the story is absolutely riveting; and the animation itself is some of the best (if not the best) I've ever seen.
One of the best things about Akira is that it is not simplistic in terms of story -- plots and subplots abound here, not so much so as to confuse an attentive viewer, but definitely far more complex than 99% of the other animated films out there. On one side we have the gang of biker punks led by Kaneda and Yamagata, and the sensitive depiction of Kaneda's abrasive/protective relationship with young Tetsuo, whose tortured heart and love/hate for Kaneda radiate from every frame he's in. On the other side is the nameless Colonel (whose mannerisms and speech suggest the legendary Toshiro Mifune, and I don't think that's accidental), in charge of Neo-Tokyo security, head of the secret ""Akira"" project, embroiled in the City Council's endless backbiting and politicking. There are also saboteur rebels, traitors on the Council, and three ""children"", holdovers from the first Akira project, who hold the key to the entire film.
The movie unfolds beautifully, combining action, character and theme so subtly, there are times you hardly notice it being done -- another sign that this is not your average animation. From the dramatic yet mysterious opening, to the enthralling battle between Kaneda's gang and the villanous ""Clowns"", your attention is captured -- not to mention your imagination. Then a subplot involving rebels Kei and Ryu, and one of the child-humanoids, is slowly introduced, then suddenly interwoven with Tetsuo's story -- and if you haven't already been hooked, you will be. The story, which covers all its bases quite well, then goes on to involve Kaneda's search for his missing friend with Kei and Ryu's plot to kidnap one of the Akira test subjects; also interwoven are the three children with Tetsuo's newly-engineered psychic abilities. He rapidly becomes addicted to them, then corrupted by them; his already-unstable personality disintegrates and he goes mad. (A key illustration of this comes late in the film: Tetsuo's mechanical arm, which he fashions with his powers after losing his flesh-and-blood limb. The filmmakers are making the point here that Tetsuo is losing his humanity, becoming a thing instead of a person. It's a bit of symbolism which in other hands would be clumsy and obvious, but which here works so well and seamlessly you absorb it without noticing.) As the apocalyptic ending comes about, the characters and stories have all become intertwined, and nothing is left forgotten or unclear -- although it may take you two or three viewings to get the full effect. And when Akira finally emerges, after haunting the entire film like a Japanese Rebecca (not an inapt analogy, by the way, as Tetsuo continually is compared to the departed Akira), the moment is, in terms of what has gone before, the linchpin of the entire film.
A few final notes: Much has been made by critics of this film's high violence content -- if you want my honest opinion, they're full of it. Akira is no more violent than a film like Predator or Dawn of the Dead; it's just that, as Americans raised on the cartoons-are-for-kids notion (implanted in our minds mostly by Disney and Saturday morning television), we are unused to seeing such a high level of violent action in animation. But in Japan and Europe, where animation and cartooning are taken seriously as an art form, stuff like this is meant for adults, not kids. My point being, once again, that this is not a cutesy-pie kids flick, and you should not, repeat NOT, allow your kids to watch it until and unless they're teenagers (i.e. 17 or 18!). My other note is that Akira is based on the manga (magazine or ""comic book"") of the same name, translated versions of which are available at most specialty comic book stores. If you think Akira is cool, get some of the mangas to find out what happens next!
Finally, I want to mention that the above review is based on the Special Subtitled Edition of Akira, which is hard but not impossible to find. Unlike the dubbed version, which at best gives you a fair approximation of the original script (in much the same way as a hamburger approximates a t-bone steak), the subtitled version (the one screened at film festivals) provides a much clearer view of the complex plot, subplots, and characters -- in particular the Colonel, the Akira children, and their various motivations. ...Remain in Light -- Phrodoe.",988761600,38,5473,4.917837837837838

When they find a person with a similar pattern who has the potential to awaken this power the question arises, can they really control this power or will it cause the end of Neo Tokyo?

629834,5,6303305520,"Akira is by far the greatest anime I've ever seen!
The story is based in the post-apocolyptic future (21st century).  The human races' population has been been dramatically reduced, but it is by no means extinct.  The remaining population is plagued by rival street gangs, a constant military presense, and corrupt politicians.
In this future, an extremely powerful psychic force, known throughout the movie as ""Akira"", has been kept under tight reign by the military.  It wasn't completely clear to me, but I beleive that the manifestation of Akira in children and young adults was a result of the military experimenting on gifted human minds to create an all-powerful military fighter.  The initial experiments resulted in disaster.
Early on in the movie, the main character of the story, Tetsuo, a young teen-aged biker, is ""found"" by the experimentation team.  He is put through the testing and Akira grows in him.  It proves to be too much for him to handle, and he quite simply goes mad from the power... and I do mean crazy-mad!  His meta-physical and telekinetic powers grow to unimaginable levels.  At one point in the movie while in the military hospital, he get's out of bed with a terrible headache and is beginning to go mad.  As he's walking towards his steel bedroom door, it splinters and shreds from it's hinges.  He stubles down the hall a little ways and a group of gaurds tries to subdue him.  This of course pisses him off, and in a fit of anger he wills a spherical force into existence expanding around himself, which just totally sends shredded pieces of the soldiers all over the corridor.
...That's pretty early on, and only a SMALL example of the things that happen in this movie.  I'll leave it at that.
If it truely helps you to decide whether or not this movie is worth buying, I can tell you that since seeing this one, I find myself comparing every other anime to it, and feeling let down that there have been no others that come close to being as good as Akira.  The animation is simply the best!  Clean, clear, smooth, and most importantly, EXTREMELY DETAILED!  I swear, not only were the animators and drawers of this movie extremely gifted, but they were also extremely meticulous about every little thing.  You've got to see it to believe it!
One warning:  This movie can be VERY graphic at times (visually, not sexually).",988675200,,2359,4.728606356968215
629835,5,6303305520,"For the most part, anime movies and series have their own following, all willing to stake that ""their"" series is the penultimate of animation. However, few movies have made the impact that Akira has on American culture and its exposure to Japanese animation. Long before Pokemon and Gundam (Though Big O is a blessing in disguise on Toonami...) we got a taste of the full emotional range and power that could exist in a cartoon, and now we're getting it on DVD!  Incredible? Most definitely. Though-provoing? Absolutely.
Akira is simply incredible, and how Otomo managed to even attempt to fit the 2,000+ page manga into a movie is stunning. Anyone who doubts the impact this movies has made can simply ask the casual anime fan what the first movie they saw was. As for pop-culture? Check out the Powerpuff Girls! They did a great spoof on Tetsuo with the ugly sister episode, and it only goes to show how sincere the fan-base is out there.
To put it bluntly, if you haven't seen Akira, you need to. If you don't own it, you need to buy it!
