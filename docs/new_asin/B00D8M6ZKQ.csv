This disc is phenomenal!!  I am writing this for all existing 3D TV fanatics and to anyone who is contemplating owning a 3D TV.  And especially to anyone who is disappointed in the 3D-ness of their 3D TV.  The video and sound are the best produced I have ever experienced.  If you want to see what your 3D TV is capable of.....Buy it!  You will experience from infinite depth to smack-you-in-the-face video. It will demonstrate what can be done with 3D TV if only the producers of 3D BD media would bother to show competence in their field.  The audio will test your system from floor shaking bass to treble as high as I can hear.  And probably higher. The content consists of varying moving shapes. That's it!!  No story.  Nothing you would recognize.  Just a demonstration of 3D video and sonic excellence.  I will never doubt my equipment again after seeing this.  Only the media I put into it.",1478390400,3,919,4.469879518072289

Andrew's 3D Blu-ray Review: 3D MASTERPIECES are the new 3D Blu-ray conceptual series of prestigious Blu-ray 3D Labels ""3D Content Hub."" With the well-known and internationally acclaimed Canadian artist SAN BASE publishes 3D MASTERPIECES the first edition of the series, which presents in future ground-breaking digital artists with its internationally award-winning 3D animation and art works.

Function of Reality allows you to relax your mind and release your stress as you flow through each world and become totally immersed within this ever changing journey. Many forms of meditation exist, but in the realm of audio and video, SAN BASE has delivered a meditative experience that leaves a lasting impression. Invention of Dynamic Painting: The concept of Dynamic Painting was discovered almost by fluke. The economic collapse of the former USSR in the nineties had a devastating effect on all aspects of life. Art supplies such as brushes, paints and canvas became hard to come by. One day, San Base managed to stock up on paints, but he could not find canvases, not even pieces of throwaway cardboards to paint on. It occurred to him that since he drew for his own pleasure, he could just paint over his old pieces of work.

As they say, necessity is the mother of all inventions. When SAN BASE started painting over his old works, he noticed something peculiar about the way he was doing it. While painting over the old images, SAN BASE always subconsciously tried to select colours in such a way, that the latest work in progress would always harmonise with the old image being painted over. This phenomenon seemed intriguing to him, so he purposefully began transforming the same picture over and over again, achieving interesting results in the process. The paintings attained another dimension - the dimension of time. But the process itself was too laborious; the paints and canvas were far from being an ideal platform for implementing the newly discovered concept. It occurred to SAN BASE that a computer or TV screen would be a much better device for bringing pictures to life than a real canvas. This is where his computer engineering background came in handy. SAN BASE put the brushes aside and started developing a program that could help him automate the image generation and transformation. The new medium was born.

3D Masterpieces Vol. 1 San Base: Function of Reality presents SAN BASE ""stereoscopic' 3D real experience of a special kind: Enchanted 3D parallel worlds, psychedelic coral reefs and crystal caves, breath-taking landscapes. SAN BASE developed like no other fantastic, himself constantly evolving 3D worlds with stunning Pop out 3D effects in an unprecedented spatial depth. With its 3D awesome effects, takes you on a SAN BASE journey in its parallel universe of the Third Kind, which is totally optimised for 3D Blu-ray home entertainment. The combination of art and music is carefully crafted to create not only one of the best examples of 3D, but an event that draws you into a stimulating journey for the senses that isn't like anything you have ever seen before.

To understand the full 3D experience you would witness, here are the Blu-ray contents titles, and here you will experience eight totally different spectacular realities that exist in the SAN BASE 3D world, that will of not experienced before, as the 3D images is the BEST that I have ever experienced before and the different categories are as follows:

01. Time Tombs [1080p] [1.78:1] [13:00]

02. Snail on the Slope [1080p] [1.78:1] [19:12]

Blu-ray Video Quality  3D Masterpieces Vol. 1 San Base: Function of Reality is presented in the most stunning awesome 1080p image transfer and has an equally wonderful 1.78:1 aspect ratio. For the most part, this is totally successful and effective super 3D video quality that is totally staggering; and with many of the 3D image sequences you get to view, you get awesome enhancements of the 3D processing effects. You will get blown away with the depth of field you get to experience and it makes you want to actually step into your 3D Television screen and explore this awesome 3D landscape. At times you feel the objects will touch you, that is how realistic the Real 3D is and I feel SAN BASE has done an extraordinary and stunning professional job, so much so, you will think it is a totally real place you are visiting, that is how good the 3D images you view are. The approval rating I give this is definitely 100% and you will be amazed what you view and you will never get tired of viewing this 3D Blu-ray disc, as you will see something different each time you view this out of this world 3D Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  3D Masterpieces Vol. 1 San Base: Function of Reality is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and is also totally impressive, because it is has an impressive energetic soundscape that SAN BASE has carefully enhanced the sound design that comes out of all your speakers, that will give you an all-out assault on the available channels and is definitely very impressive, especially going with the spectacular 3D landscape before you, so making it a glorious awesome listening experience. But what is really nice is that you have two totally different audio options for your pleasure and they are as follows:

Audio Set-up Reference Guide: You have two audio options and they are as follows: Dubstep-Functional-Mix by Proventek, Roman Surzha and Theta Relms and Deep-Meditational-Mix by San Base. I have tried both, but the best outstanding audio option by far to choose is the one by SAN BASE, as it so much more ambient exotic relaxing music extravaganza and goes so very well with the 3D images you view and will relax you at the same time.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Sadly there are only trailers for other 3D Blu-ray discs and they are as follows:

Finally, Canadian artist SAN BASE has taken his brilliant Dynamic Painting Technology to the spectacular world of Real 3D and the results are totally awesome and stunning at the same time and it totally amazed me how he created such fantastic images.

Journey through eight mind bending worlds that takes Real 3D technology to aspiring new depths that can be explored and enjoyed again and again, and with the possibility of discovering new details every time that will not of seen in your earlier viewings, SAN BASE has achieved a level of artistic complexity that engages your senses, attention and satisfies you from the moment the play button is hit.

8590620,3,B00D8M6ZKQ,"One has to take this in perspective. It is a combination of music mixed in surround with a computer generated images. If I had no reference to compare with, I'd say it is a nice example of 3D imaginary with 5.1 music. Some kind of a modern impressionism, if you will. However, by coincidence, I watched it on the same day and right after I watched Lichtmond 2 - Universe of Light. The difference in artistic level, quality of music, and quality of computer generated imaginary is striking.  After the beauty of Lichtmond, the music of this album sounds simplistic, and 3D graphics feels outright boring and primitive. This is a disk which is worth seeing, but it is not the best in its genre.

The video is not even an attempt to create an imaginary world. It is some kind of fractal design video, which shows 3D patterns which follow a certain structure and shape, but appear to be fairly random.

I was not impressed.",1415923200,2,919,4.524096385542169
