8304715,5,B001GAU0FI,Pocoyo is a funny and clever little kid. Most of the stories have a lesson and are simple enough for toddlers to follow. The music and characters are great. The white background helps kids focus on the story instead of overloading them with images. Wholesome and healthy TV.,1243555200,3,274,4.729166666666667
