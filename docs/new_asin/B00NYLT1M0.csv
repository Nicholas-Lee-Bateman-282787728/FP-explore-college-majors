8681138,5,B00NYLT1M0,"This is an outstanding film about the journey modern young immigrants are making in the attempt to leave poverty and a life without future to a different world with different possibilities.  It is not a hopeful story and in many ways it is a tragedy, but it is real and gives food for thought to those of us who live in this world which others are trying to attain.  No subtitles in this edition, but you do not have to know Spanish to understand and appreciate the importance of their efforts at transformation.",1431734400,3,512,4.494623655913978
8681139,5,B00NYLT1M0,"I should make it clear that this DVD plays on anything as it is a special Multi-Region (All Regions) edition.
Translated into English, the title of this movie is ""The Golden Dream"".
This movie was exceptional, far beyond what I had expected. I can no longer ride the fence when it comes to treating our brethren from south of the border like the human beings they are. The USA has been blessed over and over and it is morally wrong for us as a nation to turn our backs on our neighbors who are less fortunate. The people that come here from south of our border are desperate for a life without poverty and political corruption. I stumbled upon this movie by accident while looking for something else. It has won numerous awards overseas but here in the USA it's practically unheard of. Worth watching, worth sharing..",1421539200,8,817,4.5646258503401365
