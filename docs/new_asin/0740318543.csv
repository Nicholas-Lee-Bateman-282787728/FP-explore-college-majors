8415538,2,0740318543,"This movie is great if you really love the message and are no movie critic at all.
I'm personally ok with low budget movies as long as the message is right and there are not too many errors (I like to watch the store regardless of the acting).
With that being said, this movie had too many errors for me to enjoy.  It had a good message of waiting until marriage to have sex but

The lead actors were ok but I wasn't expecting the poor sound quality in outdoor scenes, poor scripting/acting in some scenes and I don't even know what happened with the dubbing.

Watch the movie for the message but even Flywheel with their low-budget was much better put together.",1306800000,,662,4.365853658536586
8415539,3,0740318543,"To be honest, this film was marketed differently than it actually was, so it is my fault for not checking the background on the production company that made it. This is an abstinence film put out by the Fellowship of Christian Filmmakers, plain and simple.

I will stay away from the content reviews as I have seen the flame wars that erupt here, so I will just hit the production quickly. The picture and sound are poor, but I do understand it is a limited budget. It felt like I was watching a home-ec class video (or even a low end Lifetime movie), and after watching so many bad dubbing errors, incorrect volume mixing, demeaning writing, bad acting supplemented by a thoroughly boring title sequence - I moved on to the special features.

The features cater to the crowd this film is meant for, including topics about how God would use this film and such. As long as you know ahead of time what to expect from this film, I am sure certain people will get something wonderful out of this. Enjoy.",1244678400,2,999,4.483516483516484
