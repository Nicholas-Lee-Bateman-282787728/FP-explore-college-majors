5853904,5,B00DSZTMD0,True Vinyasa Yoga is an awesome DVD. John has such a gift when it comes to alignment and he knows how to communicate the information for anyone to understand. I could practice with this DVD everyday. Highly recommended!!,1373328000,2,220,4.815789473684211
5853905,5,B00DSZTMD0,John Salisbury is extraordinary at allowing the student the opportunity to sink deep into a pose and pay attention to proper alignment. He is a thoughtful teacher and the DVD is a AWESOME workout! I highly recommend it.,1373241600,3,219,4.7894736842105265
8597351,5,B00DSZTMD0,"If you've ever had the pleasure of practicing with John Salisbury, you know it's about time he made a video!  If you've never been lucky enough to visit AZ or have had him as a guest teacher, now is your chance to enjoy his teachings.  This video is great for a newbee or somebody with an established practice.  John has the gift of putting together the perfect ""flow"" (sequence of poses) to open both the body and mind.  There are plenty of cues for the new practitioner and experienced yogi to get deeper in their practice.  If you're like me, and not in AZ, you'll be eager for another video to be released.  I definitely recommend this video and watching for him to visit a city near you.",1378771200,,692,4.3671875
8597352,5,B00DSZTMD0,"I found this Yoga DVD to be very useful for when I am not able to make it to the studio. John Salisbury goes into detail with each pose on how to properly do it. He tells us how our body should be aligned, how our body should feel and what our breathing should sound like. This dvd has given me more of an understanding on how to properly practice Vinyasa! I am very happy I purchased this DVD!!!",1378252800,,396,4.025316455696203
8597353,5,B00DSZTMD0,"John Salisbury truly has a gift when it comes to teaching yoga students of all levels and abilities.  My husband (who had never done yoga before) and I (who have been practicing in a studio for about 2 years) did this DVD together at home.  Both of us really enjoyed it, and got an amazing yoga workout in just one hour.  It actually inspired my husband to take classes in the studio, and now we can use the DVD when we are out of town or can't make a class in the studio.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to improve their practice or learn yoga for the first time!",1377993600,,581,4.115044247787611
8597354,5,B00DSZTMD0,"John is a great yoga teacher and I give this video five stars. Recommended for beginners and experts alike, all will find valuable tips and instruction for their yoga practice.",1377820800,,176,4.9
8597355,1,B00DSZTMD0,This is supposed to be a beginners yoga CD.  This CD is not for beginners!  The only part of this CD for beginners is in making a CD.  It looks as though the CD was made in a spare bedroom in this guys apartment.  My wife and I watched a few minutes and realized that we had wasted our money.  We will donate it to Goodwill or trash it.,1377820800,,336,3.8115942028985508
8597356,5,B00DSZTMD0,"This DVD is a perfect instructional approach for aspiring yogis of all levels. It is an excellent guide to proper form and alignment which sets the foundation for improving anyone's practice. If you are lucky enough to practice in John's Vinyasa, flow, and Ashtanga classes, this DVD gives the necessary verbal and visual cues to a better practice.  It also works as a stand-alone DVD that demonstrates techniques John shares during class. He has an uncanny ability to articulate breath in conjunction with each movement.  Watching and listening to this video is inspiring!  I look forward to repeated use; especially when I am unable to make it to class. This is an excellent stocking stuffer that I will be sharing with friends. Definitely a MUST for all yogis!",1375920000,,763,4.9453125
8597357,5,B00DSZTMD0,This video is a fantastic representation of John's class! It is incredibly challenging to hold the poses but his knowledge and ability to communicate make it easy to follow. I am looking forward to practicing more at home when I can't make it to class.,1374537600,,252,4.622222222222222
8597358,5,B00DSZTMD0,If you are a yogi on the go or new to yoga this is the DVD you NEED to have in your life. It's great for at home or pop in your laptop while on the road and get a great class anywhere you want.,1373846400,,193,3.311111111111111
8597359,5,B00DSZTMD0,"Extremely knowledgable of the human body alignment and connecting it to the breath. He came across as very calm and grounded. Which really came in handy when I needed to be calm in my mind when it became challenging. I realized how important is is to keep focusing on my breathing and how it works together with the movement of my body. A dvd that does not make you feel intimidated yet at the same time will challenge you at your level. He has cues that helped me feel what a pose should feel like. This is a dvd I can practice time and again, learn and feel good. If you are looking for a great workout or maybe you want something deeper, I say BUY it!",1373328000,,654,4.15748031496063
8597360,5,B00DSZTMD0,I love it - very easy to follow - something I would want to do daily. John keeps it fresh and fun the whole time!  Definitely five stars - would recommend to family and friends!,1373328000,2,177,4.057142857142857
