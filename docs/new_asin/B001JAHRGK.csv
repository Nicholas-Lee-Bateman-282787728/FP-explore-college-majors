3654086,5,B001JAHRGK,"Over the 12 years of this show we watched him change from a broken shell of a man to something better.  In all the episodes, this one is most about redemption and fulfillment.  If they had ended the series here, it would have been a good end of the story.  The remaining episodes are simply an epilogue to the life of this character.

I look back to when I was watching the series.  When the 12th year started, I predicted this path for the story line.",1337731200,,452,4.209302325581396
3654087,5,B001JAHRGK,"I had to give five stars because a DVD like this would be off the hook!!!
This site professes to have it, but I am not willing to pay $99 because I only missed one episode. I wish TV Land would buy it.  This was the second greatest cop show ever on  TV, Hill Street Blues being the first and ground-breaking, which all other shows emulate.  NYPD Blue was right up there and absolutely the greatest during it's 12-year run and we still mis it.  Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, and Law and Order CI, and Law and Order original.  Nothing compares.  Nothing will be that unique again.

3654089,5,B001JAHRGK,"The series comes full circle with Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) assuming command of the 15th Detective Squad on the last episode. This season introduces a new Lieutenant (Currie Graham) from the Rat Squad, who, while trying to reform the ""rogue squad"" to conform to ""today's policing,"" actually comes around to Sipowicz's way of thinking. Also new are Bonnie Somerville as Det. Laura Murphy and Lisa Lackey as ADA Munson.

I most enjoyed watching it again on DVD as they were made available; understanding the serial nature of character development.  I watched all 12 seasons when they were free on Amazon Prime.  This is the last season and owning the whole collection, being able to watch them all in order really enhances the viewing experience.

Some seasons are clearly better than others - all of them have a unique character/tone/cadence.  They are all realistic and show cops as humans with real feelings - understanding the procedures and when to follow and when to go 'rogue'.  Internal politics, interpersonal conflicts and connections and challenges make this a good series to watch and own.",1498521600,2,744,4.904

The cast members of the show had a way with connecting with the audience, that those watching the show wished that they had people like that in their own lives.  The show had a mixture of many elements which is why the ratings were high for many years.  To this day I believe it was the best show ever aired on television.  A show that has a variety of elements in it including action, comedy, compassion, drama, enthusiasm, love, mystery, romance, sarcasm, sex appeal, and violence will bring on a very large audience in any show.",1489276800,9,640,4.34453781512605

3654336,4,B001JAHRGK,"The final season had the understated drama of any great series ending. As retired Detective Greg Mattavoy said in his final scene, when he re-visited the squad while things were jumping off on several cases and everyone left at once leaving him alone, standing in the middle of the squad room ""... when your'e gone, your'e really gone.""

I guess they might do a reprise where Sipowicz heads the squad, mentoring the two newest detectives, while struggling to raise a family (Theo as a juvenile delinquent?) and  having spiritual flashbacks with appearances by Jimmy Smits, Sharon Lawrence and Rick Schroeder, and it might even work, with effective and current story lines, but TV has so much ""adult"" fare today that it would lack the novelty it had in 1993.

Multiple Emmy winning actors and show, so rightly deserved,",1480464000,3,506,5.035714285714286
3654381,5,B001JAHRGK,"One more time, a huge THANK YOU! to Shout Factory for finishing what was started many, many years ago. Those of us who are longtime fans of this incredible show have been frustrated for years waiting for the entire series to be released on DVD. While they've all been available for some time on Region 2 DVD's, we don't all have or want Region 2 players. Now, at long last, all twelve seasons of NYPD Blue will be sitting on my shelf.

The final season of NYPD Blue is as bittersweet as any goodbye, but it's a total success for everyone involved in the show. It provides a superb ending to the series in every way. And it all begins and ends with Andy Sipowicz (spoilers past this point for those who don't already know the show). First, he looks to be forced off the job by incoming Lt., and former IAB bigwig, Thomas Bale, who immediately begins making life hell for everyone in the squad, old dinosaur types in particular. After spending half the season establishing a shaky mutual respect with his new boss, Andy takes the sergeant's exam and passes. Near the end of the season, he gets his promotion and goes back in the bag as a boss in the 15th. This leads to some hilarious ribbing from his former partner, John Clark, but Clark soon realizes how lost the squad is without Andy's experience and guidance. After Bale gets shot on a raid, ending his career, he pulls some strings and helps Andy become squad commander. Concluding the series with Andy in charge was a perfect ending that I'll mention again momentarily. Along the bumpy ride to Andy's last promotion, Clark goes rogue for about half the season as he mourns the death of his girlfriend and his dad. It takes Andy getting shot outside a bar to finally bring him to his senses. Medavoy has a trying last year, also bumping heads with the new lieutenant. After being put through trial court for moonlighting as a bouncer, he begins questioning his career choice. His doubt comes full circle when he meets an attractive real estate agent who helps him make the decision to put in his papers and transition into a new profession. While it would have been nice to see Medavoy get a more noble exit from the job, it's great to see him find happiness on a personal level, which his character has searched for ever since the first season. Baldwin eventually celebrates adopting Michael, but has to help him through the murder of his father, Craig, by a jealous husband whose wife slept with Craig. A new DA replaces Valerie Haywood, who exits with no fanfare whatsoever, but her only real role is to help Clark find his way back to himself as his new love interest. In a more substantial new role is Bonnie Somerville as Det. Laura Murphy. Besides serving as the obvious eye candy detective, she's used as a central character throughout the season. Unfortunately, we don't get to see her in any steamy scenes like every other attractive policewoman (or lawyer) ever featured on the show.

One standout moment of the season is an appearance by Jimy Smits as, apparently, the ghost of Bobby Simone. I really don't care how far-fetched his scene with Andy in the locker room is, it was a thrill and a treat to see Andy and Bobby have a scene together in the show's last season. It doesn't matter if the scene was intended to be a dream sequence, a hallucination, or an authentic supernatural experience, I thought it was perfect. Smits helped make the show a huge hit after David Caruso left and became the fan favorite out of all of Andy's partners. If given a choice for one cameo from a past character, Simone would have been at the top of my list. The writers did an excellent job the whole season of bringing closure to the series, especially the last episode's ending. Andy, now the squad commander, sees every one of his detectives at the end of their shift, listening to their progress on cases and giving advice when he can. He encourages the new detectives and assures them that they'll improve with time. The last image we see is Andy behind his desk, seemingly reflecting on how far he's come in life. From the raging, crotch-grabbing, profanity-spewing alcoholic of the first season to a good husband, father, and leader, Sipowicz has undergone one of the great character arcs in TV history, and he seems to know it as the shot pulls away and the credits roll. The series ended too early, but that just assured that it never got stale. It went out on top as far as the quality of the writing, directing, and acting. Not just another TV cop drama, there will never be another show quite like NYPD Blue.",1477699200,35,4573,4.555285540704738

I was very sad that I only made it through 10 seasons when it got pulled from PRIME and seriously frustrated that I have to pay to see them.

I was binge-watching the entire 12 season series, got to season 12 episode 7 and suddenly it was pulled from Amazon at 3am right in front of my eyes, very frustrating!  I found the entire series on WatchSeries.com for free but episode 17 gives a file not found error!

3654456,5,B001JAHRGK,"I will tell you that Dennis Franz has really stood the test of time. Arthur Fancy [real name?] is one of the best actors on NY- - and was a very real part of the show--good story line for him, family. Diane [Delaney] was a bit impulsive and a bit free with her body [old fashioned way to put it].
This program was a part of my TV viewing when it first came on and now I am renewing my enjoyment getting to see this again.
  It was so good to see Rick Schroeder, Gosseleer [sp] and many others who we do not get to see on a regular basis. I would say that the actors
were chosen very wisely and played their parts with conviction one would normally attribute to a squad room of very dedicated police officers!!
  This is a block buster pretty much without equal, very realistic. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for all the different emotions on
 screen that are genuine and tastefully handled.

Love the characters although they've made the female detectives a bit on the weaker side.  Andy is the star, but every one of his partners has been likeable and about equally strong in character.  Lots of interaction during and after work.  The one thing we laugh about is, and particularly for the 80s, there are a lot of naked butts, and I'd say:  And my parents used to watch this!  Lots of NY street scenes and interesting characters, not dwelling on sensationalism of blood 'n guts, nor heavy, lengthy courtroom drama.

Rewatching the entire series (though I admit I skipped most of the first season to avoid the David Caruso garbage) I was a bit surprised at just how it has held up. The acting is fantastic and the writing is superb! Dennis Franz is perfect casting as a crotchety recovering alcoholic that friends and coworkers turn to when in trouble. Wish we could all have a friend like Sipowicz looking out for us in this world. The evolution of the character from the racist, angry drunk of the first season is a master class in character development by the writers/ show runners and in acting by Franz and James McDaniel as Lt Fancy. Many of the conflicts and issues explored by the show are the same ones in the news headlines today. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this show and how much I will miss watching it!

3655162,3,B001JAHRGK,"After 11 five-star seasons, the final season of my favorite ""cop show"" just flopped.  NYPD Blue jumped the shark somewhere in season 11 about where Connie (Charlotte Ross) just walked out one day to finish her pregnancy at home and was never seen again.  Every other character who left had a nice farewell...but not Connie.  Even if she had trouble with the ""brass"" at Bochco Productions, the audience deserved better.  But that was Season 11..and by Season 12...the loss of direction and carefully crafted story lines became totally obvious.

NOTE:  SPOILERS AHEAD.

First, Eddie simply disappears as the boss.  Just gone, no explanation.  Ditto with ADA Haywood.  Poof.  Just not there.  Connie Sipowicz never ever shows up, of course, nor do the two younger Sipowicz kids...though she's alluded to several times.

Second, the new boss, Lt. Bale, is a colossal jerk--the ultimate micromanager who's clearly gunning for Sipowicz...right up until he suddenly isn't.  Andy takes the sergeant's test knowing if he passes, he'll be a boss in uniform--totally against type.  And in the end, he actually gets to be the boss of the detective squad, but only after the Chief of D's tells him it will never, ever happen--then gives him the job ten seconds later.  The whole season feels like it was plotted on the back of a cocktail napkin.

3655584,5,B001JAHRGK,"Many years ago, my father gave me a book with 3 novels of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct series. I read them all and went on to read Connelly's Harry Bosch series (and watch the Amazon series as well.) Then there's John Lescroart's Dismas Hardy and W.E.B. Griffith's Badge of Honor series. I'm obviously hooked on the police procedural genre. NYPD Blue brought this type of story to life on TV.

The show was clearly a work of genius and that genius belonged to Dennis Franz. Following him from miserable drunk who probably should have been one of the ""perps"" to becoming a leader and father, both literally and figuratively, was a joy to watch. The stories are engaging. All the characters interesting. This was probably one of the first shows where the cast changed over the years. From David Caruso's departure to Mark Paul Gosselar's entrance, the writers were able to maintain a stability through storylines with Franz's Sipowicz always there to anchor the cast no matter the makeup. In many respects, the show improved when Caruso left because it became more of an ensemble with Franz always standing out. The genius was that, even though he was now the lead, he allowed others to shine as well.

At this point in time, probably the most fun in watching a 20+ year old show is seeing all the now-famous names who did guest shots. Of special note is Christopher Meloni as a drug dealer.

I highly recommend this show for everyone but particularly for those who enjoy the genre.",1441584000,,1477,4.694980694980695

3655849,5,B001JAHRGK,"When NYPD BLUE  hit the air waves, I was in a non-TV mode. I never watched a single episode, even though I was privy to the positive scuttle- butt.  Then I tapped into the first episode of season one and  was awestruck. The plots, acting,and pathos were superb. I scrolled down my tablet and discovered there were a total of twelve seasons and over 250 episodes available to view. I was highly skeptical that this high octane drama could be maintained over such a long haul. My skepticism  was trashed. The quality endured. Even though some of the formulaic aspects, like the flighty eye candy female characters  and their inevitable  romances became a bit trite, the show's brio remained sturdy. It was still the champ after all these years. Kudos to the entire cast and the people who invented them.",1439078400,,801,4.685714285714286
