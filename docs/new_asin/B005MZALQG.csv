8526647,5,B005MZALQG,"Natural Dye Workshop with Michael Garcia: Colors of Provence Using Sustainable Methods is a wonderful tool for dyers of all levels who seek to understand how natural dyes should be used in the 21st century. Garcia's deep understanding of the chemistry of dying and his clear and patient explanations of basic and complex applications make this a ""must have"" for all dyers.  This is the rare resource produced by someone with consummate experience who is also a good teacher. Garcia's emphasis on best ecological practices, no waste and no pollution lead us along a path of safe sustainable creativity.  The first DVD is devoted to indigo and woad and offers several easy recipes for natural vats and resists. The second DVD deals with safe mordanting of the cloth and dyeing with a variety of natural dyes including madder, cochineal, osage yellow, gall nuts and other plants. The inclusion of a recipe for fixing the mordant before dying is an important step that is rarely taught. For those seeking a more complex cloth, polychrome effects including clay resist and lemon juice color removal are also explained in a simple and clear manner.  As a dye teacher, I highly recommend this DVD.",1315958400,20,1190,4.94
