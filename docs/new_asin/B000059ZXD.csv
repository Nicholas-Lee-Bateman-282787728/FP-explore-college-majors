7934731,1,B000059ZXD,"This movie totally sucks.  Bad actors, bad everything.  Do not recommend it at all!  Icky.  Whoever said Sylvia Kristel could act was mistaken!",1358294400,,143,5.086956521739131
7934732,5,B000059ZXD,Not exactly your class A movie but interesting to watch and somewhat historically accurate. I would watch it again and enjoyed the movie as a whole.,1355788800,3,148,4.730769230769231
7934733,5,B000059ZXD,"Before buying this DVD I had read reviews and they were all complains. What was stopping me was cover art till I actually seen this flick and understood the connections between cover art, start of the movie, mentality of main character and hidden message--wars are useless and women in general and Mata Hari in particular do what females do the best--spread their legs. Some reviewers not happy about cuts and missing sex scenes, well, lets start a war on this. You wanna hear more?",1344038400,3,482,4.75
7934734,2,B000059ZXD,"Leonard Maltin's movie guide commented that the life of Mata Hari must have been more exciting than this, and I can only agree. This Golan-Globus production has a nice WWI period setting and costumes and quite a lot of nudity, but the plot is talky and slow and rather dull. The film definitely has some qualities but it was not as entertaining as I had hoped.",1289606400,,360,4.46969696969697

7934737,4,B000059ZXD,"Sex screen legend Syliva Kristel stars as the (in)famous legendary spy around the time of World War 1 (1914-1918). Masquerading as an exotic dancer, she gathers intelligence information for the Germans and later for the French. Sylvia Kristel's steamy sequences with stars Christopher Cazenove and Oliver Tobias are reason alone to buy this DVD. Recommended.",1130371200,15,358,5.527272727272727
7934738,1,B000059ZXD,"This DVD contains the cut version. Beware from that DVD.Some hot scenes are cut. For example in the edited version sex scene between Cristopher Casenova and Sylvia Kristel is longer. He kisses her va... .Censoured version omits that scene. Scene is also very long. All ""R"" rated versions are cut.",1114646400,70,296,4.94
