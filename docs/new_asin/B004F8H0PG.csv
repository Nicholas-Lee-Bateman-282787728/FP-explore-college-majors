The good news is that J.J. Star *is* the original Rock 'N' Roll comedian!  He is brash, loud, offensive & not in the least bit intellectual - the perfect Rock 'N' Roll comic!

This Blu Ray consists of a 2008 performance in Orlando, Florida. Some of the references are a little dated although the experience of Jeff Duran in his prime is like no other comic.",1365984000,,609,4.371681415929204
