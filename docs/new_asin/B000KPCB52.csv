2696823,1,B000KPCB52,"So you are in the woods, looking for Sasquatch, filming as you go along, and the first night you hear mysterious sounds below you in a gulch. Do you.

A. Not have any of the wonderful gadgets out of the case ready to use?

B. Stare into the darkness while listening to the knocking of your Videographers knees?

C. Say you have a ""vibe"" and then listen to the sound again?

D All of the above?

Notice none of the options was to be prepared and do some type of scientific study during this time.

The folks are nice enough, but just when I thought this might get good, they ended it.

All in all I can't for the life of me see what ANYONE would see in this item that would warrent a positive review.

Buyers beware.",1176422400,,715,4.130434782608695
2696824,4,B000KPCB52,"With the departures of the original Four Horsemen of Sasquatch, as I call them (Krantz - deceased, Dahinden - deceased, Byrne - retired, Green - active but getting on in years); we begin to see the emergence of the new Horsemen taking up the charge. Foremost is Krantz heir apparent, Jeff Meldrum. The freshest breath of air for the new horsemen is none other than Autumn Williams. She has taken on this task after long-term encounters. But onto the DVD:

The DVD is a documentary on research performed by Autumn Williams, one of the few women in the field. While not 'professionally' done, this documentary was largely brought into being by Autumn herself doing the writing, editing, music, and much more and it looks quite well done. I enjoyed the whole main feature of the program but may have liked her ""Women in Sasquatch Research"" more. The main feature showed a re-enactment of the Bauman story, had 4-6 testimony stories, and a large segment on the beginning of a month long expedition Autumn and her minimal crew engaged in. This segment only covers the first 10 days or so with very little happening. It ends with them deciding to break camp and go to another location which had activity the day before they decide to leave (this actually seems to be the reason they are leaving).

I would like to see an entire segment and re-enactments of her own long-term encounters, as she defines it. It would be quite interesting so I will have to check out the related book ""Valley of the Skookum"".

Overall, a little dry, but the personalities make up for it, Autumn seems quite dedicated to her research. Her whole crew is likeable and I look forward to Part 2 of the series. The down side of the dvd is it seemed kind of put out just to make some money for further expeditions but since the team doesn't appear to have any big financial or academic backing, I can accept that.",1170028800,3,1880,4.589285714285714
2696825,3,B000KPCB52,"I enjoyed my viewing of this DVD. It isn't the best one I've seen, but it definitely isn't the worst. Probably the best part of the whole DVD is Amber Williams' presentation ""Women in Sasquatch Research"". My main complaint pertaining to the DVD is the lengthy expedition footage which could have been edited to half its running time (especially since they didn't find anything of any significance whatsoever). That would have allowed additional time for more eyewitness stories and re-enactments of sightings, which were much more interesting. I also must offer my complaint concerning the re-enactment of the Bauman incident that was recorded by Theodore Roosevelt. Historically, this event took place sometime around 1850 when Bauman and his ill-fated trapping partner were relatively young men who would have most likely been packing muzzleloading rifles. Instead of using the two old codgers with modern firearms that the DVD did I don't doubt a pair of buskinners from one of the rendezvous that take place in abundance around the country could have been found who would have been thrilled to portray them. Oh, well, the wisdom of hindsight.....

Despite my complaints, like I said to begin with, I still enjoyed the DVD and my Bigfoot collection is better for its addition. In quality this DVD reminds me a lot of ""Rocky Mountain Bigfoot"". I don't regret the money I spent. I just wish there'd been a few changes in content.",1168560000,,1430,5.008403361344538

2696827,5,B000KPCB52,"Autumn Williams takes us into the world of Bigfoot research with a well crafted, interesting and entertaining documentary. We see a brief history lesson of early Bigfoot sightings through the last few centuries, dramatic reenactments of encounters, compelling eyewitness interviews, and then Autumn and her team of researchers take us with them into a remote location in the Oregon wilderness in search of the legendary Sasquatch. This documentary treats the subject seriously and respectfully with a very professional approach. Also included is Autumn's presentation on Women In Sasquatch Research, from the Bellingham Sasquatch Conference (which is just as interesting as the documentary), segments high-lighting the hi-tech gear used in the research, and a short, humorous blooper reel. This documentary was written, directed, scored and partially filmed by Miss Williams herself and it looks as good or better than documentaries produced by the National Geographic Channel!  Kudos to Autumn and her team for an intelligent and entertaining approach to a subject that is gaining more and more credibility with the mainstream populace as well as the world of science.",1164412800,10,1169,5.567415730337078

8158539,3,B000KPCB52,"Buy it for no other reason than Autumn's presentation on the bonus feature; it was very interesting.

Plus, she's on of the prettiest BF researchers I've seen.",1369440000,,159,4.888888888888889
8158540,5,B000KPCB52,"This production by Autumn Williams is a very straightforward, truthful, and well organized presentation of Bigfoot facts and field research methods. Autumn has the background and experience to assemble and launch a real field attempt to lure in the elusive creature, using many modern pieces of equipment to try to supplement the endeavor. My library is extensive on the Bigfoot study, and Autumn's DVD is a must for anyone who wants to build a working library on the subject. She is very natural and intellectual throughout the presentation, starting with a lecture and then on to the actual field setup. There are also moments of levity between the crew members to break the tension here and there, which only adds to the quality of the project. And the out-takes are superb!!",1327363200,,778,4.9465648854961835
8158541,5,B000KPCB52,"This DVD is one of the better ones I have seen (and I have seen ALOT). Autumn Williams is a great researcher and I have to admit I LOVE seeing a woman in this field. She really believes in what she is doing and takes great pains to do things correctly. There is alot of information in this DVD and is a very interesting watch. The ONLY thing I didn't like about it was, it ended too soon and Vol. 2 is not available yet :(
PLEASE RELEASE VOLUME 2, AUTUMN......PLEASE! I want more.",1304553600,2,480,4.117021276595745
8158542,3,B000KPCB52,This video starts with the background behind the legend then deploys a group of people out in search of the legendary creature. The movie was slow and did not offer as much as the extra clips had. One of the clips shows a conference held somewhere where she talks about meeting a woman from northern california and has an encounter with several of them. Her perception on the subject made much logic.,1222905600,,400,4.569444444444445

8158544,5,B000KPCB52,"I love this documentary. There is a nice mix of eyewitness acounts and a spooky month long stakeout for the big guy. Some humorus moments too. The night time vigils with rocks being tossed around and things in the darkness of the forrest making sounds would be so spooky! This is a well made and entertaining video. Lots of extra features too, which is unusual for DVDs of this genre. Recommended!!!",1217894400,,399,4.633802816901408
8158545,5,B000KPCB52,"This documentary, produced, written and directed by Autumn Williams (""Mysterious Encounters"") is quite a great one. Autumn and her team, Kelly Berdahl and Jeff Johnston camp out in the wilderness of Oregon hoping to get some footage and maybe an encounter with what Autumn calls ""our barefoot friends."" After a few days and some mysterious knocking on sheet metal, Mike Nave and Jack Peters join Autumn and her team to help out with setting up equipment in different areas around camp. The latest technology is used, such as thermal imagers, game cams, audio recorders (which pick up the mysterious sheet-metal knocking), night-vision equipment and other forms of equipment. The Bauman incident written about by Teddy Roosevelt is reenacted excellently and witnesses are interviewed for their encounters. The extras include a funny blooper reel, Autumn's lecture on the role of women in Bigfoot research at the 2005 Bellingham Sasquatch Conference and all the gear used in the documentary is described, along with links to the gear on the Internet. This is a terrific and well-balanced production, with a great professional feel to it. Two thumbs up, Autumn, and I look forward to volume 2.",1198540800,2,1190,5.170984455958549
8158546,5,B000KPCB52,"I watched this with my daughter and husband and we were at the edge of our seat! The end of the DVD had us *sighing* and saying, ""That's it?... where's the second one!"" Autumn has a confident and fresh way of bringing the ""legend"" into your home showing you that ""he"" is out there! Great job, Autumn! Can't wait for #2!",1181865600,2,319,4.245901639344262
8158547,5,B000KPCB52,"The ""Women In Sasquatch Research"" bonus feature was extremely interesting to me.. There were a lot of facts presented here that I found intriguing. Also the eye-witness encounters are captivating, too.... Of course I was hoping to see actual filmed footage of a Sasquatch! Not just some questionable occurrences during their initial search, darn it! Yet,I still gained a lot of insight through this DVD, as a greenhorn in Bigfoot study and exploration by purchasing this video.

 Who knows what we might see in volume 2, and I hope it won't be too long in the making of it... Since I am a member of Autumn's website Oregon Bigfoot, I'm glad I purchased this DVD, for continued research for the (next) ""Search For a Living Legend.""",1177632000,,730,4.785714285714286
