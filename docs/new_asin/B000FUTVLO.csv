2590827,4,B000FUTVLO,"Don't get me wrong, Season 3 is definately worth watching. It has all the amazing shocks and twists of the first two.  However, I'd have to say that this was the worst of the three thus far. There was just too much inconsistency with what was going on. Too many questions were raised and were never touched on again.  The sex scenes were also cut down majorly and were substituted with some bizarre shockdrama. I guess you could say that season 3 went a little too far over the top this time around. The story didn't flow as well as it did with seasons 1 and 2.  Still worth the buy tho. Heres hoping that Season 4 corrects some of this season's flaws. Look for it September.",1150416000,9,675,4.299212598425197
2590828,4,B000FUTVLO,"... but still good. I've been a Nip/Tuck addict since the night it premiered, and it remains as stunning, shocking, and insightful as it's always been. I give it only 4/5 starts simply because I was bored with the Carver storyline way before it ended, and found the conclusion somewhat unsatisfactory.",1150329600,4,301,4.921568627450981
2590829,5,B000FUTVLO,"I am one of those people who doesn't have the luxury to purchase cable or satellite tv and I've always heard of the enchanting tales of Nip/tuck on the radio or saw the commericals on regular tv.  To my surprise I went to target one day and to my surprise I saw Nip/Tuck season one and two on sale, so of course I purchased it immediately season one that is for $22.99.  I ended up watching all the discs and loving each and every single one of the episodes.  As soon as season 1 was finished I immediately ran back to target to get my season 2 and there was only 1 complete set left for again $22.99. I was so elated...I completely watched each episodes in like 2 weeks and was practically crying throughout the whole season of season 2.  This is one of the most brilliant, realistic, well written show that I've ever looked at.  It's like you connect so much to each character that you've left heartbroken especially at the end of season 2.  I love this show and I can't wait for season 3 to come out on dvd.  when I get season 3 I'm going to look over season1 and 2 then look at season 3",1150329600,2,1090,4.137440758293839
2590830,5,B000FUTVLO,"Nip/Tuck took awhile to come back and when it did it didn't disapoint at all. It almost even convinces you that Christian was killed by the carver and it turns out that it's just a dream he tells Sean about. While Matt becomes more of a problem especially after he's told that Ava (Famke Janssen) used to be a man. So he sets out to find her or someone like her. Instead he gets mad and beats up a tranny when he sees that he/she has male parts. Matt later on gets chased down by he/shes that beat him up and pee on him.

  Also Christian hires a new partner named Quentin while Christian thinks about his future as a plastic surgeon. Neither of them like him much and it doesn't help things when he trys to get with both of them on seperate occasions. Also of course it doesn't make Sean feel any better for him when he starts showing an interest in Julia.

  Julia opens up a beauty spa and doesn't get the support from her mother that she wishes she'd get. Which leads to an excellent episode where Julia thinks her mom might've been on a plane that crashed. That's probably the most gripping episode next to the season finale. Things also get serious between Christian and Kimber and the season offers a lot of brilliant moments between the two.

  The show can have it's gross-out moments since they are plastic surgeons but if you get into the story and the characters, the show is hard to resist. The season finale is just brilliant and has two edge of your seat moments actually occuring at the same time, now that's good tv! It also manages to make you feel for Matt after making him easy to dislike earlier in the season. He gets stuck in a very bad situation with a girl's father who has to be the most hateful guy on the planet. While Christian and Sean also are in a life threatening situation after it's reveiled who the carver is. This is just a brilliant season that deserves as many nominations as possible.",1149552000,27,1924,4.351955307262569

2590833,4,B000FUTVLO,"Twisted, racy, and entertaining. Nip Tuck is a great series.  Each episode features a new client seeking out a little nip here and a tuck there.  I actually found myself looking up some of the procedures they were doing!  Even though each episode introduces a 1 time character in most cases, there is a very deep story line that evolves through the main players in the series.  The acting is amazing and you will find you have those characters you love to hate and ones that you connect to.  Even though the events in each episode are different, this is something that you do have to watch in sequence of else you will get lost. Happy binging!",1489536000,,643,4.461538461538462

2590836,5,B000FUTVLO,"Darkly designed, Nip/Tuck was a show I was addicted to during its original FX run despite the fact it offered a plethora of cringe moments.  The series followed the highly erotic and unusual lifestyles and operations of two plastic surgeons.  Most, but not all, season 3 episodes focused on The Carver, a deadly maniac out to undue the perfect visual standards set by society.  The quest to stop/reveal the carver is brought to a climax in the final episode with a conclusion I considered a bit unsatisfying and far out even for this show - but it still allows season 3 to be my favorite of Nip/Tuck.  Other episodes from this season dealt with an obese woman fused to her bed and a funeral parlor employee who takes a disturbing interest in his work
The show certainly is intended for mature audiences.
The DVD presentation includes a pair of nice behind the scenes documentaries and some scenes remove from the shows' original presentations.",1481846400,,943,4.766871165644171

2590859,2,B000FUTVLO,When Nip Tuck started it caught my interest.  But like so many continuing stories Nip/Tuck fell into the same hole.  Take two of the Stories... they created the Character who contracted HIV and then the Morbidly Obese Mama.  Just two examples that are way too unrealistic to keep your interest or gain your compassion for which it seems to be the purpose.  The HIV Positive person would not be in the situation in real life.  Upon becoming that sick with HIV she would have received her medications through Medicaid and Ryan White Funding at probably no charge.  She would probably be eligible for Disability or again Medicaid.  She lived on a Boat you know.  She had a child which gained her more money from the Government for living expenses..Probably better than the way she was living.  This was not set in 1981.  And Mama..she was left on a couch to sit in her own waste.  You have to be rich to die?  Yes if you want a 100 thousand + funeral.  Or maybe you should invest some of that Tevo money on Life Insurance.  How about the Plastic Surgeons paying for a Cremation? A nice Urn.  Hillbilly could keep the nice Urn instead of a disgusting Couch. Such a Fascinating Show but again as usual poor writing and imagination.......,1453680000,,1232,4.561643835616438

2590864,2,B000FUTVLO,"I did not like Season 3 for the most part. The storyline about the Nazi family was the worst part. It makes it seem like the people who wrote the show are living in the 1930s or 1940s. Nazism as a serious mainstream political movement died in 1945 along with Adolf Hitler. If they had made Ariel's family just a bunch of bigots who hate Jews and homosexuals, that might have made sense, but specifically making them Nazis did not make sense because they were in the 2000s not the 1940s, and because they lived in America and Nazism is a German patriotic movement. The Carver storyline was sometimes interesting, but it would have been better if they had not made Quentin Costa/the Carver a eunuch, that just made it seem hokey.",1448496000,,727,4.515151515151516

2591004,3,B000FUTVLO,"It is my opinion that Season 3 of Nip/Tuck lost its appeal. What use to be edgy and creative, now seems redundant and silly. The writing is now starting to feel forced, although I am trying really hard to hang in there. Sean is more confused than ever. Christian is still being Christian. Julia has become irritating and opened a ""spa"" with Christian's old flame. Matt, Sean and Julia's son, has become down right stupid. While you were once sympathetic, you now frown and suck your teeth. He has become pathetic.  And the main storyline, for two seasons now, The Carver is finally revealed and I was so disappointed that I felt cheated. I mean for several episodes, we have had buildup, creative storylines and some clues as to who the dastardly villain is, only to have a twist thrown in there that on the surface would have been better they taken a different avenue. This season, the attempt to push the envelope simply didn't work for me. Hopefully the writers will find their old magic and start writing well, instead of just ok. I for one am a fan who doesn't just want all edge and shock, but some of the old charm of past seasons.",1216166400,,1138,4.497584541062802

  Otherwise, however, the show is still fascinating, with Sean undergoing a midlife crisis, Troy being left at the altar on the brink of marriage to Kimber, a patient who wants to get rid of a perfectly good leg, Julia starting a surgical recovery spa (oddly with Gina in tow), Liz still enduring the two high maintenance surgeons, and the terrifying outcome of The Carver's story.

2591035,4,B000FUTVLO,"Last season end, Christian was attacked by The Carver.  This season, The Carver continues his escapades.  On the surgery side, Sean and Christian must separate an obese woman from the couch she has grown into after spending three solid years on it.  (yes, it was her bathroom too)  Surgery is performed to fix a bad facial scar on Kiki the gorilla, to make her more presentable to mate in a wild kingdom way.  A full facial skin transplant is performed, and Sean and Christian must dismantle ""Frankenlaura"", a pieced together cadaver that a mad mortuary assistant had sewn together.  The surgeons must reason coherently with a man who believes he'll never be whole unless his perfectly healthy leg is amputated. (Body Integrity Identity Disorder)  Mrs. Kringle (Santa's wife) is discovered carrying a 15-year-old petrified fetus in her womb, and through it all The Carver continues to carve and rape.

Guests this season include Joan Rivers as herself, Anne Heche as Nicole Morretti in the witness protection program, and a full season performance by Rhona Mitra (Hollow Man) as Detective Kit McGraw.  Also returning is the fabulous Vanessa Redgrave as Julia's mother Dr. Erica Noughton.  By the way, I still miss Escobar.

On the plot end, a lot happens this season.  Dr. Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) joins Sean and Christian when Christian has a hard time returning to work after his Carver attack.  Detective Kit McGraw not only investigates The Carver but strikes up a threesome with Christian and Kimber.  Christian gets arrested as The Carver, Kit tracks down Christian's birth mother, Julia and Gina's new recovery spa creates a j! zz face cream, Sean goes to work for the witness protection program leaving Christian and Quentin to run the clinic, Christian plans a wedding with Kimber, a plane crashes that was supposed to have Julia's mother on board, Matt gets in a fight with Cherry Peck ... a trans$exual, Matt takes up a new girlfriend who happens to be a white supremacist, and Julia becomes pregnant.  While Sean and Christian are separated and Christian is working with Quentin, Christian takes over some of the hesitancy that Sean used to bring to the clinic, which was an interesting role reversal for the main characters.

I highly recommend that if you haven't watched the series from the beginning, you should.  Many pieces of the Troy/McNamara puzzle presented in this season won't make sense without the background of the first two seasons.  Plus, I believe seasons one and two were better than season three.  This season, there were less surgeries and more drama, and I tend to love the FX of the surgeries more than the dilemmas of the characters.

Nip/Tuck is a guilty pleasure.  It's a show that has no sense and no morals, some reprehensible characters, is overly dramatic, contains ridiculously over-the-top scenarios, and yet is compelling in a ""train wreck"" sort of way.  It's so bad I simply can't look away.  It's so ridiculous that I'm completely addicted to it.  It's the ultimate nighttime soap opera with a decent enough amount of gore thrown in with the surgeries that it has a special appeal to horror fans with open minds.  My major complaint with season three is that it went light on the surgeries and focused too much on the drama.  The Carver turned out to be a surprise, with a little surprise of his own to reveal in the end, giving a satisfactory ending to The Carver's storyline.  Let's hope season four has more surgeries.

Another note of interest is the soundtrack to the series.  Playing Queen's ""Fat Bottom Girls"" during a hinder lipo is genius.  The only season that sold a soundtrack was season one, and I highly recommend purchasing the soundtrack CD, which is excellent.  I just wish they would release soundtracks to seasons two and three now.  The music selected really compliments the surgeries and other scenes in the series.

Though I hate to admit it, I highly recommend this series.  It's the ultimate of guilty pleasures.  Enjoy!",1190419200,,3995,4.894345238095238

Well, it has always been packed with shock-value and seedy thrills, but it also had some deeper undercurrents and poignant moments, and most important, I actually found myself interested in the characters and caught up in seeing how their lives and relationships unfolded.  That was during seasons one and two.  Season three, however, was exactly like I thought the show would be before I ever started watching.  Completely shallow, it seemed like all the show's writers focused on was shock-value and seedy thrills, but to this end they began somewhat repeating themselves, and really reaching.  It seemed to get pretty lifeless, and I found myself no longer caring about the characters or what happened to them.

No surprise that this kid is just as wishy washy as his father.  I know that teenagers go through a rebellious stage, but this boy takes the cake.  Everyone in this family, except for the little girl, and I say give her time, has killed someone.  In season one, Julia absolutely doesn't want another kid, now she does?  As a divorcee?  And what about her mother?  Is she or isn't she alive?  I can believe how quickly something like a plane crash is just dropped by the next episode.  At the end when her mother is sitting on the couch, I'm like, is this a dream?  What was the point in going through all of that?  And don't let me get started on the whack storyline about the carver--that literally has to be spoon fed to you in the final episode because nothing about it made sense.

The flow of the storys is intact; its just they have done so much in the previous seasons its getting harder to find those moments that set a show apart from any other (both within its own world and that of other shows).

The Carver is a great part of the series and it is brilliantly used only sparingly so that the viewer doesn't get sick of it. The Carver does have a presence throughout the season though and it's great when you find out who it is. There are other great story lines though, all that Matt goes through, Christian's past comes up again and he goes through hell this season, Julia's business ventures.

I read some reviews here that didn't think highly of season three and thought it was a bad season, well, i thought this season was one of the best seasons in the show, it was darker and more thrilling and i enjoyed the Carver storyline alot !

This season truly pushed the audience over the limit, and brought up some very disturbing issues and dark matters ! very intriguing plot lines and very intersting characters.

I haven't seen this season on tv, i just borrowed the DVD of season 3 from my sister and immediatley started watching, it was so addicting that i finished the whole season in three consecutive nights !

So my advice to you is to just buy this DVD and enjoy this perfect season of this excellent show, it really is worth it !

The Carver plot line is just too stupid for words, the writing ham-fisted, the acting posed and cliche. The goodwill earned in the first season -- already stretched to the limits by the ludicrous time distortions inherent in the depicted healing processes  -- evaporates by the third overlong limey monolog by the chick from Boston Legal. By the end, the characters are so pompous and wooden, the plotlines so hoakey and patheticc that you'll be saying ""never again"" as you chuck the boxed DVD set into your Amvets donation box.",1166745600,4,797,5.03030303030303
2591134,2,B000FUTVLO,"I am new to nip/tuck, but I have seen the three seasons in succession and, like most people, was hooked and thoroughly impressed by the end of season 2. Season 3 took all the things that made it a good show and cast them to the side. All the characters were doing uncharacteristic things that bordered on cruelty on the part of the writers. Christian has sex with an ""ugly"" girl by putting a bag on her head. Horrible. What's worse is that the writers decide that it is better that the woman like it. Absolute ridiculousness! Of course the biggest misfire is the Carver, a sidenote from season 2 that was wonderful but became an ongoing mystery that no one wanted to solve. We had storylines that would have been much better to explore - Matt's new dynamic between Sean and Christian, Christian's love for Kimber (great character, until the writers got to her too), Sean's issues about his career (the FBI Witness Protection Program gig could have proven a far more reliable and successful source for storylines). All would have been better than the stupidity of Dr. Costa and his ""hideous"" sister Kit (how does someone with such a sorted past become a top detective in England that is brought in on a case in Miami that she is unable to solve for well over a year, while she drags everyone in and accuses them of being the murderer? I mean, she dragged in Liz! Preposterous!). Season 3 is abysmal. Best to put it out of your mind and hope season 4 goes back to what made in great in Season 2.",1165363200,8,1493,4.452554744525547
2591135,5,B000FUTVLO,"I bought Nip/Tuck because one of my friends wanted to watch it during her slumber party. She had a thing for Christian Troy. Tha party never happened and my Season 1 stayed in its packaging for the longest time. Then, I started watching it while I did other stuff. It took a while for me to get used to this show. But before I knew what hit me, I was a Nip/Tuck junkie. I ordered Seasons 2 and 3 shortly thereafter and watched them as quickly as possible.

Season 3: The Carver story made little sense but it kept me watching nonetheless. I finished the whole season in less than a week (mind you, I do have a full time job). You have to watch this show knowing that it's a fairy tale for adults. That way, you won't be scratching your head, thinking ""Okay, that would never happen.""

Some random notes: Why did they have to humanize Christian? I liked him better when he was a modern J.R. (Dallas). T.V. shows have a way of making all villains soft at some point. I think it sucks. What else? I can't stand Julia but her mother is so believably awful that I feel sorry for her. Am I the only one who thinks Matt looks freakishly like Michael Jackson? Most of the time, I want to slap him around. Kimber? I hate the hair style and the dark eyebrows. Is she supposed to remind us of Marilyn Monroe? She wouldn't even pass for an imitator in Vegas. Anne Heche was annoying. I have mixed feelings about Rhona Mitra, aka Kit. I kind of liked Dr. Costa.

This is a show with everything from sex, to murder, love, hate, yet it is one of the best performed and exciting show on TV. If U have not seen it, YOU MUST! The 3rd season, so far has most of the horror U can ever imagine. One Dr. is a handsome devil, single and many hot woman for him. The other partner is a family man, but they cannot seem to make it work. They both have done their share of screwing up the marriage. Now their oldest son is getting married. Wait until you see who it is.  There is a man going around carving up the faces of all the beautiful people. That is in season 3. And since almost everyone, at least most of the main characters are so beautiful, they are all getting carved up. The carver is obviously a very sick man So he slices and dices and ruins any beautiful faces. But there are our heroes. They fix them all up, and you would never see it ever happened. Yes, practically impossible, but it is TV. And boy, does it make for a show that is so worth while to see. But that is only a small amount of work our loving Doctors do. Nothing stops Mcnamara and Troy, world renowned plastic surgeons from helping all the carvers vicims. Even when they are carved themselves. This will be one of the most suspenseful shows in season 3 that you will ever see. Don't even try to figure it out You will not. But when U do, WOW will you be surprised. Of course there are many other scenes in this season, that will also keep you begging for more. Watch all three seasons. That way you will get to know the main characters, so when you see the things they do, you too will understand.

It is an amzing show. Definitely on my Top 10

The program becomes more dramatic and tear jerking in the third season. I thought the first two seasons really added that shock factor and seemed to move at a lightning fast pace from one story to the next. The stories seem to drag out a bit  more in season three which is indicative of any dramatic series getting past the first 30 episodes, fewer ideas so lets make more out of the ones we have.

This season is still good though and certainly worth owning and besides if you are a nip tuck fan how can you not own it. If you don't then that will be what you don't like about yourself.",1160611200,2,701,4.109489051094891
2591172,4,B000FUTVLO,"As much as season 3 of `Nip/Tuck' really slipped as far as delivering the goods, it still serves up better entertainment than most television series today.  It's still just as addicting, it's just not as rewarding in the end.  I will say though that the season finally was a doozy and made up for some of the sub-par episodes throughout the season.  So, Matt (John Hensley) goes through a rebellious Neo-Nazi stage as he mourns the loss of his girlfriend, and once he finds out that she was really a `he' he goes even more berserk.  He takes up with a crazy white supremacist (Brittney Snow), beats up a transsexual and turns to hating his family.  Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon) are still trying to work out their relationship after the discovery that Matt is indeed Christians son, and then add to the mix Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) the new bi-sexual plastic surgeon they hired on to take some time off of Sean's hands.  The soap opera begins as Quentin propositions Christian then starts dating Julia (Joely Richardson) who has just opened a business with Christians ex Gina (Jessalyn Gilsig) and Liz (Rhoma Maffia).  Oh yeah, and there's the mess with that pesky Carver who hasn't stopped making a mess of the faces of America.  So Christian takes up with the cop investigating the case (Rhona Mitra) as well as getting engaged to Kimber (Kelly Carlson) and then getting accused of the murders himself.  Oh yeah and then there's the woman in the Witness Protection Program (Anne Heche) who takes up with Sean.  So with all this going on it becomes a bit difficult to stay on board.  The Carver story goes a bit extreme, the soap opera turns a bit exhausting and the relationships between the main characters gets a bit unrealistic (not to mention the off the wall surgeries) but all that included I'm still addicted, I'm still watching and that's why I give this four stars...because it wouldn't be `Nip/Tuck' unless it were extreme...that's what we love about it!",1160611200,,1989,4.752906976744186

2591186,4,B000FUTVLO,"Wow!  This season is just nonstop crazy!  I'm not going to spoil all the hard to believe scenarios, but try watching this in a nonstop week of fun loving surgery, and see how crazy this season is!  That's what my wife and I did last week!  Wow!  What a freakfest!  I think that son has been to Hell and back.  It's weird, because when I watched the first season, I remember thinking:  whoa I hope my son is this mature as a high-school student.

Of course, when you find out your older girlfriend has a little something extra, that would have a tendency to freak a high-school kid out.  But I'm not so sure I agree with the adult subjects that they expose this high-school kid to.  Who really believes he would be in a 21 or older bar, buying drinks without being asked for ID?  Come on.  And why does he suddenly want to explore the Transsexual world, when he was shocked by what he found out? Wouldn't that make you run away?  What's up with that?

I noticed a definite drop in sex during this season; especially between Christian and various sex buddies.  I know he was with Kimber for most of that time.  I hope this doesn't become a regular thing, as I love those spicy scenes.  In fact, I saw a lot more blood and gruesomeness, and a lot less fun stuff.  Ohh, well.

The whole ""Carver"" plotline was interesting, but why did it have to be a major character.  I was hoping for the ""Scooby Doo"" ending, where the police officer would pull off the mask, and it would be Barney, the nighttime janitor.  And he'd say something like:  ""and I woulda gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you pesky kids, snooping around,"" or words to that effect.  That would have been SO AWESOME!!!

But seriously, I think the show is very interesting, but the craziness of the plotlines can get a little bit too ""envelope bendish.""  If you get my drift.

I give this 4 stars for originality and craziness. I drop it one star for actually titling one of the special features, ""Chasing the Carver"" as if the ""criminal plotline"" was something to feature over the Cosmetic aspects of the show.  Come on!  That British accented detective was the worst interviewer I've ever seen!  Terrible!  Writers, stick with the sexy plot writing, and leave the criminal writing to the NYPD Blue and Law and Order crowd.  Please!

2591188,5,B000FUTVLO,"""Nip/Tuck"" is a seriously f****d up television show.  I thought ""Six Feet Under"" was pushing the limits and ""Oz"" always liked to pour it on, but even if you put those two shows together they are not as f****d up as ""Nip/Tuck.""  There is no other word for it, especially since the producers of this show revel in the fact.  I mean, we thought the Carver was pretty bad (""Momma Boone""), and that whole story gets worse (""Rhea Reynolds) and then finds two levels beyond that (""Cherry Peck,"" ""Quentin Costa"").  Mercifully that whole subplot comes to an end, although in a whole bunch of ways that we never would have expected.  But given some of the other people we meet in Season 3, the Carver ends up being one of the saner people in South Florida.  There is ""Momma Boone,"" the obese woman who has to be surgically separated from the couch she has been sitting on for three years.  What about the mortuary employee who created a woman, ""Frankenlaura,"" from the body parts of other women?  Or ""Ben White,"" who suffers from Body Integrity Identity Disorder and wants his perfectly healthy leg amputated?

I have only recently gotten up to speed with ""Nip/Tuck,"" because I was not especially interested in watching a television show dealing with plastic surgery.  Not because I am opposed to the ludicrous extremes to which (primarily) women go in this country to attain an idealized notion of beauty, but because I do not like to watch surgery being performed.  Specifically I do not like the cutting part.  In high school they showed us a film in health class to dissuade us from smoking.  It was not when they took out the cancerous lung that bothered me, but when they took the scalpel, made the initial incision, and then cracked the guy's chest with a rib spreader.  ""Nip/Tuck"" likes to show as much as they can get away with, and even if it is fake, it takes a while to get used to.  But apparently I am completely desensitized because there are dozens of victims of an airplane crash (""Sal Perri""), a face transplant (""Hannah Tedesco""), and a seventeen-year-old fetus (I will let you be surprised as to what episode has that surprising turn of events).

If you think the plotlines are f****d up, then you should see the characters.  It used to be that I was pretty sure Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) was at the top of that list, but he might be the sanest of the principals given everything that happens in the third season, even though he tries to get married and finally meets his birth mother.  Of course, it is hard for Christian to take comfort in his life when dating the likes of Kit McGraw (Rhona Mitra) and Abby Mays (Rebecca Metz), makes Kimber (Kelly Carlson) look good.  Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) has a relatively easy year once he gets past Nicole Morretti (Anne Heche) and the fact that his new partner, Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) is dating Julia (Joely Richardson).  But then Julia's entire year is pretty much a case of it being the best of times and the worst of times.  She opens up a successful business (""Joan Rivers"") and her marriage ends, but certainly the year is exemplified by what happens to her when she learns the plane her mother (Vanessa Redgrave) is on crashed on takeoff (""Sal Perri"").  Talk about having your best moment and your worst moment in the same episode.

Even though he is not in all of the episodes, Matt McNamara (John Henlsey), wins the award for having the worst year.  His world is rocked when he visits Ava's house, finds Adrian's body, and then learns the truth about Ava from Sean (""Kiki"").  If you thought Matt's relationship with Cherry Peck (William Belli) took him to the dark side, wait until he becomes involved with Ariel Alderman (Brittany Snow) and her father (Brian Kerwin).  Then I remembered that he has Julia, Sean and Christian for parents, not to mention Ava as a therapist, and there is really no reason for us to think life will be much better for poor Matty.  I can also justify my choice because when we get to the big finale in the season with the Carver plotline it is juxtaposed with the final act of the strange and twisted little journey Matt took during this season.

The obvious question at this point would be why do I watch ""Nip/Tuck""?  A large part of it is because it is so over the top.  You would think that at some point they would run out of ways to keep piling things on, but that certainly did not happen in the third season.  But beyond that what I find compelling is how despite wallowing in circles of Hell worthy of Dante (or at least David Lynch), these characters keep managing to find their humanity.  When Shawn looks at Momma Boone and holds her hand as if she were not the side show freak that others consider her to be and when Christian can allow himself to actually feel something, their characters stop being cruel jokes.  The revelation of the Carver's identity and the end game of that whole bloody affair are what dominate the final episodes, but for me it was Matt finding his way back from the dark side, even when the mouth of Hell opens up around him, that was the dramatic highpoint of ""Nip/Tuck: The Complete Third Season.""  I want to think that it is all down hill from here and that there is no way the show can top how f****d up everything was this past season, but I think there is ample reason to be more afraid of the producers of ""Nip/Tuck"" that either a scalpel or the Carver.",1157760000,24,5404,4.525720164609053

2591190,2,B000FUTVLO,"FX network was bleeding advertisers by the end of the third season of Nip/Tuck.  The 4th season opened sans any normal advertisers, instead with in-house movie promos.  I can't help but think this show would fare much better on HBO or Showtime, rather than on basic cable.

The entertainment industry critics seem to think that ""edginess"" is synonymous with quality, and this show has as much edge as a scalpel.  Love it or hate it, it is edgy only for its willingness to show simulated sex, simulated surgery, simulated gore, a teenage boy being duped into a relationship with a transsexual, transsexuals engaging in group urination on a teenage boy, rape, torture, sodomy, and violence on a scale that brings to life the violent fictions portrayed in movies like Videodrome and Clockwork Orange.

FX's generous promotion of the show, along with a slew of A-list celebrity cameos clogging the episodes, indicates lots of entertainment industry insiders pulling for this show, in spite of broader public rejection of the program.  Again, why isn't this show located on the premium cable channel equivalent of the red light district?  Nip/Tuck's place on basic cable seems to exist just for the sake of being naughty, like a child who just discovered four-letter profanities and both the corresponding parental disapproval and peer adulation that comes with their new-found potty mouth.

FX's effort to keep this program on life support speaks of an agenda that gives credibility to those who accuse the entertainment industry of defining deviancy downward.",1157500800,3,1556,5.146825396825397

The writers changed the charecters and slapped us in the face with the outcome of this carver deal. The show used to be upbeat and still had a playfull tone even though there were some major issues. I would still find myself laughing or smiling about something every episode. But every episode in season three was so depressing and dreary that it was tough to make it through to the end.
 The character changes through me off big time. example: Dr Troy's hair was tore up the entire season. I know its kinda nitpicky but he was a player and he seemed like more of a loser. Dr McNamara and taking in the witness protection family was plain dumb.
The kicker for me was when you find out the secret of Quentin. It seemed as if the writers ran out of ways to shock their viewers so they came up with something very stupid. I was shocked but at the writers for being brain dead.

Season 2 is still the high point of this series.

Also, whoever said season 4 is the last, that is not true. FX just hasn't renewed it yet beyond that. Ryan Murphy said he is willing to go up to season 7, and it just might, especially since it is the higest-rated show on FX. It even has better ratings than The Shield, and they're starting their 7th season next year.",1154908800,5,690,4.348837209302325
2591196,4,B000FUTVLO,"The ""Reality TV Crowd"" will probably be disappointed with this season and if ""The Carver"" is all that's kept your attention up till now, don't bother.  The conclusion may not be ""twisted enough"" to fulfill your expectations. Season 3 requires an attention span and some degree of intellect.  The individual story lines, twists and turns of deeper more significant plots are being woven just below the surface of the highlighted issue of a serial rapist on the loose, presented in who-done-it format. Many of the underlying stories are setting up the next season and no doubt will be explored throughout season 4.  We may not have seen the last of Quinton and company.  The subject matter takes a more serious tone in season 3 and attention is given to long-term effects of decisions made and actions taken.  The show is still amazing and I don't think the shift in priorities has hurt the show, but rather has managed to enhance it. Season 3 of Nip/Tuck is still worth the investment.",1153440000,6,984,4.764705882352941
2591197,3,B000FUTVLO,"Season 3 of Nip/Tuck failed on so many levels. This season did not even stick with a solid story line for each of the characters. The main characters didn't even have much interaction with each other, especially Matt. The first 2 or 3 episodes were great. I got bored with this season after about halfway through the season, but I continued to watch it anyway. The whole Carver thing was the most obvious thing ever, but they didn't even expose who it was until the last episode. The carver was present since season 2 but we don't get to know who it is until the last episode of season 3?? Horrible cliff hanger. Season 1 + 2 were farrrrrr greater than this one. Although, it still is one of the better shows on television these days. I hope the writers get their act together for the 4th and final season.",1152489600,7,806,4.38
2591198,3,B000FUTVLO,The characters  really got lost in all the hype  of  the whole Carver storyline. They milked the whodun it for all it was worth until it reached an unsatisfying and predictable conclusion. I think Entertainment Weekly got it right in saying  it was if the writers were writing the season on their computer with one finger and flipping us off with the other.,1151452800,4,357,4.619047619047619
2591199,4,B000FUTVLO,"To the reviewer who blames Amazon for the late release of this DVD set--you should be blaming FX. Yes, the Region 2 DVD set has been out in the UK for some time, but FX wants you to watch the reruns this summer and THEN buy this set. Personally, I think it's a bit obnoxious to withhold an American TV show while allowing it to be sold abroad, but...

On to Season 3. If you're thinking of buying this, you're obviously already familiar with the far-superior Seasons 1 & 2. Forget the horrible Season Finale exposing the Carver. Forget the idiocy of the plotlines. What spoils this season is the overall feel that the writers had no idea who these characters were, and what was happening to them week by week. Situations arise, never to be addressed again. Not one main character on the show acted anything like his or her previous self. Matt is suddenly a neo-Nazi freak. Julia and Gina in business together? Christian PROPOSING to Gina? Ludicrous.

But, whatever. They got me. I'll buy this in the hopes of catching whatever sparks I may have missed last fall.",1151280000,6,1062,4.554973821989528
2591200,1,B000FUTVLO,"I have to say that I am a little bit dissapointed in Amazon's late release of Nip Tuck Season 3 for the US. If you look at the Amazon. UK website, you will find that this has been released for some time now. I know that this is nowhere near as bad as say....price gouging on the new X-Boxes that were in limited supply at Christmas, but I feel like we are getting the shaft again. I think that I am done with Amazon.",1150848000,2,416,3.9642857142857144
2591201,5,B000FUTVLO,"FX Networks have been putting out consistently the best TV on TV for the past few years now. THE SHIELD, RESCUE ME, and NIP/TUCK are the best examples of edgy, adult-oriented drama on TV. Despite the fact that this season was a little on the scatter-shot side as far as its multi-layered plots were concerned, it still maintained the highest level of writing, directing, and above all, performance. Dylan Walsh, Joely Richardson, Kelly Carlson, John Helsney, Vanessa Redgrave and Rhona Mitra are all about as spot-on as you can get in their roles. Still towering above them all however, because of the sheer awesomeness of the role and the actor, is Julian McMahon as Dr. Christian Troy. His performances over the past three seasons have been pitch-perfect. His hedonistic highs and his hellish lows are just amazingly portrayed. It's very difficult to pull a role like this off, someone who has so many layers of self, and McMahon does it with ease.

Now this season, as I said, is a little sporadic, and the ultimate storyline's payoff is a little on the weaker side, the rest of it glides forth majestically. The main plot involves the hunt for The Carver, someone who, in believing that ""Beauty is a curse on the world"", hideously disfigures and brutally assaults the beautiful people of Miami, and especially has their sights on Dr. Sean McNamara and Dr. Christian Troy, the two premier plastic surgeons of Miami. Who is The Carver? What is their true intent? Who will be the next victim? These are just portions of the third season. We have Matt, the son of Sean, Julia and Christian who is currently in the midst of a personal and sexual identity crisis after learning that his last love was actually a post-op transsexual. We also have Christian and Kimber heading to the altar! Julia is... pregnant? Julia's mother is in a firey explosion?

Some of this sounds like bad soap opera, but the acting and writing far transcend that of the usual soap, and the addictive nature of the show keeps us coming back for much much more!",1150761600,5,2033,4.740112994350283
2591202,5,B000FUTVLO,"As the third season of Nip/Tuck begins, Sean (Dylan Walsh) comes to the aide of Christian (Julian McMahon) after barely surviving an assault by the masked Carver.  From that point on, the season kicks into high gear as Sean and Christian take on a new partner (Bruno Campos), Julia (Joely Richardson) teams up with Liz (Rhoma Maffia) and Gina (Jessalyn Gilsig) as they go into business for themselves, Matt (John Hensley) questions his sexual identity and ends up falling in with a girl and her uber-racist father, and Christian's relationship with Kimber (Kelly Carlson) takes a serious turn, even when they are joined by a kinky cop (Rhona Mitra) assigned to the Carver cases.  There's so much going on throughout this season that it's amazing the way Nip/Tuck manages to weave everything together without getting too redundant.  The surgical cases that Sean and Christian end up getting involved in, including a gigantic woman literally stuck to her sofa, nearly reach unfeasable heights, yet manage to stay compelling.  The only low point of the season comes when Sean considers leaving his old life behind when he begins doing solo work for the Witness Protection Program on an ex-mob wife (Anne Heche) and her son, but thankfully that passes quickly.  When the season comes to a close and the Carver returns and his identity revealed, along with a few other plot points that will be touched on again in the upcoming season, you'll be left wanting more; something which Nip/Tuck has successfully managed to accomplish during it's entire run.  All in all, the third season of Nip/Tuck is yet another superb season of surgery and sex, and this DVD set should whet your appetite until the upcoming new season premieres.",1150761600,46,1721,4.958333333333333
