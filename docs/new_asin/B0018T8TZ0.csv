8271057,1,B0018T8TZ0,"i was very disappointed with this concert, it is the poorest quality and i found there's a way better remastered version of this concert available for free if you have a dvd burner and the proper burning software. this product isn't even worth the one star i gave it but i wouldn't be able to post this reveiw otherwise. don't waste your money buying this.",1245801600,2,356,4.492307692307692
8271058,1,B0018T8TZ0,80% of this disc is of rather poor quality. It has it's moments but overall is not worth buying.,1239321600,,96,4.105263157894737
8271059,1,B0018T8TZ0,"The video quality is very poor. The audio quality is very poor. It looks like it was first recorded on tape, and then played back with the tracking adjustment set terribly off from proper tracking while a DVD of it was made. The picture is frequently very dark and the sound is unclear and warbled. NOT WORTH THE PRICE AT ALL!",1235347200,,326,4.360655737704918
