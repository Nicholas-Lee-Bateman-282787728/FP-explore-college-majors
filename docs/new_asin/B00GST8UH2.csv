6108100,5,B00GST8UH2,I greatly enjoyed watching this movie and appreciated that core Christian values presented in it. I like that this movie focuses on growth and awareness. I will say the description above is slightly misleading (I'm pretty sure this movie is set in Louisiana). I don't think that matters in the grand scheme of things though. I'm glad I own this movie! :-),1393286400,32,355,4.741935483870968

What we want is movies like they did in the thirties and the forties... thats when America knew how to make movies!",1392336000,94,386,4.450704225352113

Well, it worked.

I'm dumbfounded as to exactly how that happened.  But, I became a believer.

Perhaps it was magic.  Offbeat.  Low key.  The film has a lot of heart.  Made me think about what is - or should be - ""normal.""

There is a saying, in writing, that ""Less is more.""  I believe this film illustrates that same truth, to viewers who may have thought the film too short and needed more.",1470614400,2,486,4.241758241758242

From the write-up and reviews and the consistently high-ish price, I was really excited to get it on an auction site for a reasonable price (actually MORE than Amazon is now charging!). It turned out to be a good movie but not great. The nastiness of a number of Normal's residents initially is truly uncharacteristic of small-town people; I've lived in several small towns, and they really do somewhat resemble Mayberry--residents NORMALly bend over backwards to help out a stranger. Instead these folks seem to take pleasure in harassing the heroine. And falling in love in three days? The story line is one that's been written and rewritten and RE-rewritten: uppity professional woman, engaged to someone even higher up in her upper class circle who quite obviously isn't the perfect match for her, is thrown into a situation with a rough-around the edges guy. She's initially annoyed, then knocked off her feet by his blunt honesty and genuine warmth and ends up dumping her stuffy almost-fiance for this small-town guy. It just didn't grab me the way I expected. I'm a romantic, but this was just a little too contrived. And even the Christian theme somehow didn't seem as believable as I thought it would; it almost seemed as if it was sprinkled throughout so that someone could call it a Christian movie. It WAS squeaky clean. It was pretty enjoyable. It just wasn't remarkable.",1469923200,,1439,4.853658536585366

6108695,5,B00GST8UH2,"Candace Cameron Bure doesn't disappoint, starring in this fun, romantic comedy, with Christian overtones.

She plays a successful, self-centered LA surgeon going on a road trip with her plant to New York City, to work, doing profitable concierge medicine and hopefully to marry her doctor/business partner/boyfriend.  Like the Michael J. Fox movie, she gets waylaid in a small town(in Louisiana) forced to do community service. She butt heads with a local ""Jethro""- ""$5 charm, $10 smile"", and learns some things about what's really important in life from the town folk and especially the wise, judge.

Well scripted and shot, it's funny, touching and without being preachy, it presents a nice message about God, faith, and finding meaning in our short lives.  I always seem to enjoy her movies.",1458950400,,794,5.1796875

Just because someone doesn't embrace small-town Christian life doesn't make them evil. if the film was written better, I could stomach it.

Since their ATM is broken, she can't pay the fine, and is sentenced to a couple of days of ""community service"".  She has to make house calls, so the local doctor can go fishing.  It's super cute without being too cheesy.  I have watched this movie about 10 times.  It hits the topics of life and death and what is really important in life.  The big city surgeon finds out there's more to life, than Latte's, massages and BMW's. I highly recommend this movie.",1446508800,,765,4.478260869565218

She also seems to lack experience with different cultures or backgrounds.  The average age of a surgeon is 37 and while Ms. Cameron-Bure looks to be the right age, her character is emotionally retarded and far too immature to be responsible for a life.  Sure, I've known doctors with a poor ""beside manner"", but she is chi-chi and ridiculous to the extreme!  I think I'd rather have sepsis than have her as my surgeon.

All the casting is good. The actors are professionals. Lou Beatty, Jr. is great as Doc. Trevor St. John IS Lucas Craig. If that boy is not really southern, he deserves an Oscar for this one, he is so real.

I came from Country, and never wanted to go back there. But I love the music in this movie--great saxophone at the dance, And Trevor St. John as the country boy, though he's ""not my type"", I'd follow that ""five dollar charm and ten dollar smile"" to the dark side of the moon! His dancing with his little niece was as heart touching as the expressions on his face. He's either very real in this part, or a consummate actor.

The faith that shines through this whole movie is so real! It's not self-conscious or preachy in any way. It just flows in the lives as naturally as breathing. The wedding dress is the loveliest I have ever seen. There is a lot of ""stage business"", very subtle, that I don't see in this genre as a rule.

It is just exceptionally well done. Evokes really good emotions, and I actually play it over and over like a favorite music album because it makes me happy.",1436918400,5,1256,4.313559322033898

6108937,4,B00GST8UH2,"I liked the movie. I gave it 4 stars. I do have a beef with whoever is responsible for writing the credits. The song played during the Foundation Day Dance was not ""Stay"" by Jake Smith as credited. It was ""Something Like You"" by Jason Martin & the Corner Pocket & is available as a digital download on Amazon & you can also buy the Blackout Sessions CD there. It includes this song. I think you would be quite disappointed if you bought the Jake Smith {All That We'll Ever Need} CD and listen to the song ""Stay."" Not to slight Mr. Smith but there's a world of difference between the two songs. As someone who pays attention to the songs in movies & always watches the song credits I have been turned on to many songs & artists that I would otherwise not known about. I have never seen a mistake like this made before on any song that I have checked out. I wonder if Jason Martin has considered a law suit.",1429228800,,905,4.206896551724138

6108963,3,B00GST8UH2,"Self-absorbed, brash LA doctor is trying to get to Long Island to be with her long-time/term fiance whom she will join a practice with. She gets stopped for speeding in a small town I thought was in Louisiana (but who knows as the geography in this movie was a little puzzling). She gets taken before a judge as there is a warrant out for her arrest as she has many outstanding unpaid tickets she just didn't spend the time taking care of. She can't pay them as she only has a credit card. So she gets sentenced to 2 days community service making house calls as a doctor and this is intentional by the judge as we see.

The over all plot point of this movie is a great one. Slow down. Live a great life as we only have one. Etc. But there is some weirdness. I am the first to admit that non-Christians do not ""get"" Christians sometimes. That is OK. We do come across strange. And that is OK too. But there are some strangeness even for me in this movie. The entire point around showing up in court while not a lawyer. Weird. Anyway, the multiculturalism is a an obvious attempt at ""hipping"" up the Christian movie. It doesn't belong here. There is also the intentional point of hiding the sexuality of the big black guy. He comes across very gay. But then he dials it back. Anyway those parts are just made up and politicized overkill in this movie. If those had been removed it would have been a great little show. But I will say that the over all message here about not making your ""things"" your God and helping people instead of yourself wasn't done in a preachy way I don't think. I mean this woman wouldn't have been so easily swayed I don't think in 2 days but it is a hour something movie after all.",1425945600,,1706,4.265432098765432

6108996,4,B00GST8UH2,"Dr. Lisa Leland (Candace Cameron-Bure) is one of those surgeons what's more about the posh lifestyle and the sense of entitlement and the material rewards that go with the gig. (Her vanity plate reads: ""MD U NV"") Dr. Leland embarks on a 3000 mile drive from Los Angeles to Bridgehampton, Long Island to hook up with her concierge doctor boyfriend (Andrew Bongiorno). But on the outskirts of Normal, North Carolina, her sleek beamer gets pulled over by the local lawman and it's when her 23 errant parking tickets come to bite her. The local judge (Lou Beatty Jr.) sentences her to 16 hours of community service, and when she sasses him, he ups it to 24 hours, to be served in eight hour increments (or three days). So here's Dr. Lisa Leland, fish out of water, disdainful look on her face, as she takes in the provincial sights of Normal (pop: 321), little knowing that she's the answer to a good man's prayer.

So it's a tried and true formula, this premise about the self-satisfied city slicker come to the boonies to ply his sawbones trade, and I refer to shows like 1991's Doc Hollywood, 2007's Country Remedy (a.k.a. Simple Things), Northern Exposure, and even Cameron-Bure's own 2014 Hallmark picture, Christmas Under Wraps. But I happen to like all of these movies, and I very much like Finding Normal (2013).

It's one of Cameron-Bure's best films, and has stuff to say about slowing your roll and taking a breath and enjoying the simpler things in life, and so what if we're revisiting age-old drops of wisdom? Cameron-Bure and her solid supporting cast and a well-realized script make us appreciate all over again the charms of a small town. In a tiny community like Normal's most folks wear more than one hat. Lou Beatty Jr. is simply marvelous as the local judge/doctor/coroner/preacher man. It's wonderful how he exudes warmth and kindness and a homespun sort of sagacity. Trevor St. John plays the love interest, and it's par for the course that Lucas Craig (St. John's role) and Dr. Lisa would have a combative first encounter there at the only street corner that gets cell phone reception. Rolling with the ""more than one hat"" theme, Lucas is the surly town mechanic/amateur attorney. He thinks she's spoiled and shallow. She thinks him coarse and rude with a $5 charm and a $10 smile. Yeah, I suspected right away that it's curtains for her jerky concierge doctor who charges $2500 per house call.

It's a faith-based movie yet the Christian message isn't shoved in your face, and that restraint tends to have more of an impact on me. It helps that I like the lead character. Dr. Lisa Leland's arc traces a familiar trajectory, but the journey is worth it. Her nights spent in a prison cell (no motels in Normal). Pancake breakfasts at church. Slow dancing at a Founders Day dance while being serenaded by Jason Martin & the Corner Pocket band. An adorable little girl with the cutest southern accent. Fun with wasabi. A gradual life-changing dawning. And, look, there's Dr. Leland, having taken a permanent detour to Normal (pop: now 322).",1423440000,,3057,4.764150943396227

6109180,1,B00GST8UH2,"I like watching dorky feel-good movies after a hard day at work, but this one started getting creepy a few minutes in. This woman ends up stuck in a small town where one man is the judge, doctor, and pastor. He's apparently asked God to send her to the town. God answers his prayer. (Um...not exactly an interpretation of Christian faith and prayer I can really apprecaite). The man, Leland, also IS God for the town, and the ""magical negro"" for the main character. Everyone in the town is vaguely Christian and nice and the woman, who is from Los Angeles, is a self-centered b**ch who needs to be corrected to be more like them.

Basically, instead of feeling like a small town, it feels like a cult, where everyone is under the control of the judge/doctor/pastor. Everything happens in order for the woman to learn a lesson. None of the characters have any substance outside of their functioning to lead her to decide to move to the town. I had to stop watching about 40 minutes in.",1413590400,2,984,4.52808988764045

6109205,2,B00GST8UH2,"The reviews of this are surprisingly uncritical, mostly due to a pro-Christian bias among its fans--as if one has to support the movie, no matter what, just in order to get more like it made. Maybe that is the case, and if so I hope that future movies from this studio are better written. If looked at objectively, this is a rather clumsy--and sometimes un-Christian--movie. Yes, I really mean that. Warning, there are spoilers below.

Setting: On the surface, it is a story of a big-city doctor who finds her spiritual center and happy ever after in the last place she would have looked: small-town Louisiana, where she happens to get into a spot of car trouble. Sound like Doc Hollywood? Yep, but not as good, unfortunately. The town is not as charming as Doc Hollywood, and in fact can be downright creepy in the way it is artificially constructed. The judge-slash-doctor-slash-pastor of the town is a highly-respected older black man, breaking stereotypes of the South (good!). However, he is the ONLY black man in the entire town, it seems. He has not married and brought black children into the world; instead, he has adopted two white orphans and raised them instead. To be fair, he has raised them well, but it just seems contrived. Why bother? Give him a nice Christian black family. The romantic hero does not need to be this man's son, if you are unwilling to consider an interracial romance. He can be a neighbor or a friend.

Characters: If you are going to keep the oprhan plot line, then give real depth to the characters. What happened to the orphans' parents? The grown orphan woman was a single mother, and I wanted to know her story. The odd-duck sheriff who seems rather dull-witted but plays the sax with soul--did he really need to be such a dolt for half the movie? If we're challenging stereotypes of Southerners being bumpkins, then don't make them bumpkins. The best Southerner in the whole movie was the federal court judge, who was sharp and thoughtful. In general, the clunky character development felt like the script was a college film school project.

Plot: The idea of bringing the ACLU in as the big bad wolf is rather amusing, and the way these Northern Liberal Elite (headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts) are defeated hardly qualifies as clever. One of the biggest mistakes in storytelling is to underestimate your audience, yet the directors here do not seem to believe that their viewers will understand the ""complicated"" legal hopscotch without hitting us over the head with it several times. Better yet, could the hero, Lucas, have found a better way to defend his public display of the cross? Giving up on the issue of free speech--and forcing him to buy the land under the cross--almost smacks of giving into the Liberals. And, once again, if you're trying to prove that this self-taught lawyer is so smart, why have the female doctor character point out to him the difference between public and private land, which ends up being the key to the case? Did he really need her to explain it to him after the judge pretty much laid it right out? If so, he really is not that bright.

Acting: The male hero was well cast, and he acts the part well. I liked him, and I found the doctor's attraction to him, his lifestyle, and his faith very believable. However, the rest of the casting was pretty uninspired. The doctor herself is too unlikeable in the beginning. She has no charm from which to build up a rapport later. Her edges soften, but she is never fun to like. This transition is the toughest balance in a romance like this one, and this movie does not quite get it right.

Message: So, what's un-Christian about this movie? Two things struck me. First, the fact that the judge-slash-doctor is also the local preacher is somewhat insulting. I know many reverends, pastors, and chaplains, and they work hard all week long. You don't just get up in front of people and say a few words off-the-cuff. Even if your doctor and judge duties are not too taxing, being a spiritual guide in a town of faithful people is a full-time job. You spend hours writing sermons, you work with families in need, you lead youth groups, you counsel couples getting married, and on and on...In other words, you work hard. To make it seem otherwise is frankly not fair to Christian leaders everywhere. (I did like the parable of the pecan tree, by the way.)

The second worrying thing is the fact that Lisa, the female doctor, heads off with her slick city boyfriend Steve after he proposes. She is falling in love with Lucas, the self-made lawyer (does he have another job?), but she still goes with Steve (to build up tension, presumably). Now, Lisa and Steve have been dating for five years, apparently, and they were a typical urban secular couple, so let's just agree that they have had premarital sex. Are we supposed to suspend belief that she does not have sex with Steve in the interlude between their engagement and marriage? Come on. Maybe I am the prude here, but it feels an awful lot like cheating on Lucas, at least in her heart. Lucas says he values promises people make to each other, but she breaks two--one to Steve when she walks out on her wedding day (really?) and one implicit one to Lucas when she comes back to him and does not apologize for making the mistake of sleeping with another man. Maybe she doesn't owe that last apology to Lucas, but I felt like the happily ever after scene needed a little more depth to it.

Just because a movie (seems to) follow one's religious beliefs does not make it a good story. Fans of inspirational Christian fiction should demand intelligent stories with layered characters. Why settle for less?",1411603200,20,5682,4.676

The judge/doc/Dad in the movie has an especially soothing voice and very laid back character, making this a very relaxing movie to watch.  The actors all portrayed their roles very well, to the point where they were very real and I didn't think about how well they were playing their role until just now, and it is a movie you can sit down and watch and feel comfortable with your kids or your parents and not worry if their are any risky scenes.

6109298,3,B00GST8UH2,"Some of the negative reviews seem to be to be a bit harsh, but it is true that this movie is at times cartoonish and dreadful.  Some minor plot elements were a joke (not in a good way).  For example, the main character does not have an Iridium phone (you'll know what that refers to about 18 minutes in). The little things do pile up quickly and are almost innumerable. Just keep in mind that in the production of this movie, no effort whatsoever was made to ensure that things were realistic or made sense.  The movie was shot in LA, but is supposed to be in NC, except when it's set in LA--references are made to the town being in both places.  Think about it this way: Normal isn't a physical place; it's an idea.

Some positive reviews miss the mark a bit, too--the Christian angle is somewhat limited.  It seems more of a small town vs. big city type of movie than one that's Christian (though, to be sure, some of the characters definitely have a spiritual focus, and the short sermon on Sunday is actually pretty good). The small town-based romantic plot line was a little disturbing, though it's probably true that some people do form attachments that recklessly in real life.

6109363,1,B00GST8UH2,"Insultingly dull, trite, obvious, and two-dimensional.  The two romantic leads have no chemistry and are basically unlikeable human beings throughout the film.  They are both appallingly shallow and her so-called transformation is completely unconvincing.  But what's worse is that it's impossible to care what happens to either one of them!  Finally, I found it constantly distracting that this woman is so stick-thin to the point that I wondered if she was suffering from anorexia.  Why is it necessary for Hollywood to parade these gaunt, scrawny women in front of us and tell us that this is attractive?  Why on earth can't they find actors with some normal proportions who look healthy?  The other message I resent is the silly notion that somehow country people have a wisdom that city people clearly lack.  Really?  Lack of a decent education, either in the country or the city, doesn't make a person wise, just ignorant, no matter where you come from.  Shut this off!!!",1405555200,7,977,5.012422360248447

6109370,1,B00GST8UH2,"I don't know what it is about this movie that causes viewer to believe it is Christian. The most likely explanation is because there are occasional generalized terms implying that a god of some sort is at work, but that's a common element shared by hundreds of beliefs. There are also vague references to Bible content but ... when used as isolated 'sound bytes', the actual meaning of these statements are often taken out of context.

Christianity is unique in that unlike any other belief, Christianity teaches that mankind cannot reach God simple by trying hard to do positive actions. Christianity clearly states that NO action is good enough to deserve forgiveness (apart from acknowledging that God has settled the debt when Christ was crucified). Clearly this distinction is NOT present in this story and without it, the religion could just as easily be the Jehovah's Witnesses or Unitarians among others. As for the concept of so-called `Christian values' in the story, even they fail to be present (based on my observation).

Being a Christian myself, I find movies like this embarrassing. No. Let me change that to shameful. First off ... Finding Normal is an obvious rip-off of the movie Doc Hollywood, and the feeble attempt to disguise that fact, only serves to make the story even less believable. It does remove several of the low-morals characters which were so plentiful in Doc Hollywood but then makes substitutions which aren't much of an improvement. (I'll explain a bit later on.)

There are so many holes in the story that it hardly has enough substance to even hold the holes together. Right from the start ... even if there was a logical reason to drive (rather than fly) all the way from L.A. to Long Island (which isn't justified in the story) she could have driven through NORMAL Illinois and cut 200 miles and several hours off the trip! Another unexplained problem is why she is driving down a 2-lane road in the middle of nowhere when she is pulled over. It's just one senseless situation after another!

Supposedly the town of Normal is a microscopically small town in North Carolina but the actual movie sets suggest that it's Louisiana. Whatever! It really doesn't matter (much) except that Louisiana doesn't have mountainous terrain and it would be impossible for the boyfriend in Long Island to drive to even the closest part of Louisiana overnight. [Both of these situations are used for the story.] However ... the most blatantly miswritten part of the story is the totally indefensible suggestion that there are any Christian values present anywhere in the story! How is it that someone writes a fictional story, thusly allowing the characters to be anything they want, and none of the 3 main characters is a good example of proper Christian behavior?

Character #1 The doctor/judge (oh yeah ... did I forget to mention moralist and preacher) is using the philosophy that `the end justifies the means', and as part of the plot, he abuses his authority to essentially kidnap the passer-though. Also as part of this scheme he suggests that God is helping to make it happen. Lastly and most unbelievably, it is clearly an attempt to use blackmail to detain the passer-though, ultimately achieving his own selfish goal which is of course to find a replacement for himself, as the town doctor. Nowhere in the Bible are we taught that the end justifies the means, most especially not blackmail!

Character #2 The victim of the kidnapping, the lady doctor, becomes disillusioned with her previous ideology of worldly happiness, but she never shows any detectable 'spiritual change' in her priorities apart from the obvious forsaking of wealth in a small town practice.

Character #3 The country bumpkin Lucas shows where his heart is when he snookers the high powered ACLU lawyers with the old statue of liberty play, buying a tiny little piece of land that a cross is displayed on, and thus foiling the evil-doers intentions to have it removed. I don't think I'll ever understand why so many professing Christians fight so hard to protect icons and idols (which the Bible clearly states are wrong to make in the first place).

What more can I say? It's not hard to find a movie that has a really awful premise but this one really sticks in my craw, because it gives Christianity a black eye!",1404691200,10,4323,4.8561736770692

6109379,5,B00GST8UH2,"I resisted watching this movie because I thought it would be a ""road"" movie. I've seen some on Hallmark and it isn't my favorite story line, so I have passed this movie by for weeks and weeks. Today, bored and trying to stay out of the oppressive heat, I rented it. I am so glad that I did.
Candace Cameron Bure plays a doctor from the big city who lands in a small ""middle of nowhere"" town. Because of prior bad acts (not paying parking tickets), she finds herself doing community service for three days. No surprise as a plot device, the town needs a doctor. As the main characters, who represent town folk, seek to win her over, we see the usual country fare. God, church, and community are mentioned, and a dance isnthrown in for good romantic measure. Meanwhile, materialistic doctor-boyfriend is waiting in the Hamptons for Lisa, (Cameron-Bure's character) to complete her journey. He call periodically to remind her that she is costing them major bucks by landing herself in this predicament. I was glad that the film makers didn't complete that typical story arc and make the boyfriend, Steve, a total jerk. He was kind of a jerk, but really, he just didn't get it. The film stays less mean spirited that way.
Cute, sappy, contrived, predictable are some of the adjectives used, or at least the thoughts conveyed in some other reviews. All of it is true. If you're not a Christian, and you try really hard, you'll be offended. You'll just have to get over it or ask Amazon for your money back. However, if you're reading this review, you were warned.
I thought this was one of the sweetest, freshest, movies to come out of...where? This didn't come out of Hollywood! I'm thankful that someone put down on film and integrated it into a believable story line just how stupid it is to protest a cross in a community where everyone agrees that it should be there.
I'm thankful that someone put on film that a woman who ""just wants a good life"" can find one in this ""backwater"" setting. One reviewer said that the romance story was contrived, but it's not. I lived it to a degree. I'm a city girl who married a country boy. I looked at the goodness and honesty of his life and left my Beemer dreams behind. And after reading and working and living in a society where it seems no one shares my belief in God, it is so nice to see a Christian film that celebrates belief, that treats belief with respect and shows people with faith as ones to be admired, not mocked.
So often in these films, the acting in stilted at best. The locations are contrived, the music is bad. The whole thing just makes you cringe because you want good, Christian entertainment, but you want all of the ""Hollywood"" stuff as well. This movie delivers! You won't find any of them up for an Oscar, but that's getting to be a secular joke too, isn't it? No, this isn't the best movie I've ever seen. These aren't the best actors. But, this movie made me smile AND I didn't browse the internet while I listened to it, either.  As soon as I finish this review, I intend to buy the DVD. Why? Because the next time I'm bored and it's too hot (it'll be too hot tomorrow and the day after, and the day after...) I'll have it here and I can watch it again.",1404086400,34,3223,4.425925925925926

The characters lack any chemistry whatsoever and the locals are made out to be simple and backwards. The film's premise relies upon the town of Normal being a a place that invites a sense of opportunity and life changing realisations, unfortunately it's very uninviting and I think viewers are expected to suspend disbelief far too much. Overall it has a very two dimensional plot, the film makers seem to have forgotten that character building and crafting a story that unravels with some sense of feasibility is important rather than just ramming an idea down your throat and pretty much speaking the simplistic plot out loud. There are so many great films that give you something meaty to think about in a subtle and well crafted manner but this just isn't one of them neither is it a successful romance movie. We spend only a couple of scenes at the beginning of the film with Lisa the female doctor before we are launched into the goings on in Normal, and the film rather relies on us assuming her to be an extremely self centred and fairly unpleasant money grabbing individual in order for it to work, however she seems to be neither of these things. It relies too heavy on thin stereotypes. I think I can see how this film is loved by some especially if you share it's limited views on people. Very strange how a film like this even got made really as it's essentially a remake and not one that brings any thing new. All I can think is it's a vanity piece or made for a very specific market who like their films bland, harmless and to fit into a very narrow world view. It's unfortunately a film that is vastly better in it's quite interesting paragraph long summary than on the actual screen. Personally I'd say it's one to give a miss.",1400457600,13,1908,4.533333333333333

The chemistry between the two principal characters, Dr. Leeland and Lucas, is excellent.  The verbal sparring between these two actors before they settle their differences is extremely humorous.",1400371200,,301,5.1020408163265305

6109525,4,B00GST8UH2,"""Finding Normal"" is a lighthearted romantic comedy with a religious and moral message that provides an enjoyable and occasionally humorous hour and a half of watching appropriate for the entire family. The story line is predictable. Right from the start we are set up for the one crucial decision that the protagonist, a secular doctor from Los Angeles who is moving to the Hamptons on Long Island, will have to make. There is little suspense in the film.

The acting isn't great. Candace Cameron Bure does a good job of acting her character. The other actors are average. Moreover, there are some incongruities. First, why does this doctor, who is in a hurry to get from Los Angeles to New York, take a route that puts her in the Deep South, when anyone with an atlas or Mapquest will quickly discover that this is a very roundabout way of going? Second, exactly where is Normal? According to the synopsis, it is in North Carolina. However, on the wall of the judge's office (in Normal) there is a map of Louisiana.

Despite these flaws, this is an enjoyable movie. While a Christian message is in evidence, it is not preachy.",1400284800,,1127,4.658291457286432

It's only through Him that we can approach God because He is our reconciliation to the heavenly Father. This whole movie leads me to believe that this is a ""works based"" denomination that made this movie or these are Christians who are ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I've always liked Candace Cameron Blure in Full House and thought she was cute no matter what her size, but in this movie it seemed like the main focus of the camera was about having to see how tight Candace's pants were since she's slimmed down. Sooo...Hollywood! Also, God's command about being ""equally yoked"" was ignored if these characters were suppose to be Christians. Harsh, but true.",1399334400,8,809,4.664335664335664
