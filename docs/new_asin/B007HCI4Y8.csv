8516647,4,B007HCI4Y8,"It is a movie that is really 70s-era cinema, particularly a melodramatic musical score which obscures what could have been a substantive plot & message.  A good brainless movie anyway.",1465084800,,184,5.133333333333334
8516648,5,B007HCI4Y8,I saw this movie years ago and really liked it.  The acting was natural and not stiff.  The main characters are good looking.  I liked the personal growth the priest experienced.  It wasn't just about him getting some from a pretty woman.  He clearly was having some  questions about his path in life before he even met her.  I just enjoyed it and am glad I could finally get it on DVD.,1383350400,,386,4.277777777777778
8516649,5,B007HCI4Y8,"I liked this movie when it first came out, and had been trying to get a copy for
years. Now I have it!  Good perspective on priest's life.
Good acting. Brought back memories, thanks.",1364688000,,182,4.352941176470588
8516650,3,B007HCI4Y8,"At one point in this film, socialite/social worker Pamela (Lauren Hutton) tells faltering priest Greg (Robert Forster) that's he's in limbo. Sadly, that applies to the film overall, which I truly wanted to like much more than I eventually did. The premise is potent: a young priest in 1970 is torn between his vows & his love for a woman, and is questioning the teachings of the church. It was a major social & cultural issue in the late 1960s/early 1970s, ripe for serious exploration on film.

So what happened?

The problem is that it doesn't quite know what it wants to be, beginning with the look & tone of a made-for-TV movie with greater ambitions. And to be fair, there are times when it does push past its limitations, especially as the story progresses. This is due largely to the intense presence of Robert Forster, who brings more to the role than he's given by his dialogue or the director. Lauren Hutton, on the other hand, is far more uneven. When required to depict anguish or rage, she falls terribly short, though she always looks good in her Halston wardrobe. Still, when she's being coy or sparring verbally with Greg's superior, she's actually not too bad. But she's obviously more model than actress here.

Then we have the Michel Legrand score, symptomatic of the film's flaws. It would be perfectly acceptable & enjoyable in a frothy, lyrical, lightweight romance -- which is where the film goes far too often -- but it's out of place when the film hesitantly ventures into darker territory. ""Hesitantly"" ... that's what trips up everything. You can tell that the film wants to be more than what it is -- and it's clear that the potential for a deeper, more nuanced film exists -- but that potential goes unrealized for the most part.

As an artifact of its time, it's worth seeing, I think. It's never really bad; it's just that it's seldom really good. So a very large caveat to the viewer: don't expect too much, and you won't be too disappointed. It's just a pity that it didn't take any chances, as it could have been something with genuine impact.",1345248000,5,2077,4.635869565217392
