There is a lot to learn and some cool techniques taught and I would recommend it for massage therapists who are interested in incorporating some Ayurvedic into their practice.",1396396800,,347,4.704918032786885

8503901,5,B000UUCK5I,"I have been managering an Ayurveda Day Spa for four years and in the industry for a life time.  I personally grow,concentrate,blend herbals and oils for Ayurveda Spa treatments and doshas. I have numerous healing and traditional modalities but living in Australia one needs to incorporate techniques that correspond with both traditional India and  our Australia. I have purchased many DVDs from USA.For anyone interested in moving their passion to another level Integrative Ayurvedic Massage is a must especially if you don't live in USA where it is possible to undertake a course with Carollanne Crichton. As this DVD was 3 hours long and very indepth one gets to experience better techniques and remember those you have forgotten.
Inspiritational and Rewarding and extremely hard to find.",1336176000,2,791,5.26984126984127

8503903,5,B000UUCK5I,I am currently studying Ayurveda and I found this DVD extremely helpful.  It shares a wealth of information about Ayurvedic massage that I haven't yet learned as part of my school's curriculum.  I have already started integrating what I have learned from watching the DVD into my massage practice and my clients couldn't be more pleased.  Highly recommended for massage therapists!,1191715200,8,381,5.213114754098361
8503904,5,B000UUCK5I,The production is very well done. Carollanne makes Ayurvedic principles relevant for practicing massage therapists. The amount of practical information packed into this training DVD is worth so much more than what I paid for it. I will use it as a reference guide for many years.,1191628800,9,279,4.957446808510638
