7950659,5,B00005QIVR,The cd was Real good. But what i like about the dvd is some of the songs are more extended than they are on the cd. They have to cut wonderful parts out of the songs on the cd due to space. But the dvd can hold more than the cd can. This is the first hillsong album where the music becomes more modern up than past projects. I still Love the albums from FOR THIS CAUSE & down. But i Love it even more where Hillsong gets from You are My World & Up. The only thing i don't like about THIS IS OUR GOD & up is it needs more Darlene Zschech. The songs are real worshipful. I Love the lights on the stage as well very cozy. It makes me sad that this wonderful dvd is now hard to find to buy. it breaks my heart they discontinue the dvd. I'm thankful i was able to get copy of this dvd & cd as well.,1389398400,,793,3.7261904761904763

7950661,5,B00005QIVR,"I can't express how good this Worship video is!  It remains my very favorite, even several years after it's initial release.  Like other's have commented, you can feel God's presence when watching .. I always wish I could have attended this particular concert, but in a sense, you will feel like you're part of the experience & can't help but to worship & praise God while singing along!  I have purchased several of these throughout the years and have given them as gifts to family.  I have no doubt that God's Spirit will touch any who will watch it.  Truly beautiful & a testimony of Christ's love for us.  The DVD is getting rather hard to find these days, though.",1208649600,,668,4.525
7950662,5,B00005QIVR,"You will want to see this video over and over again.  Every song is inspirational and full of life. All ages will enjoy the music that flows from Hillsong as they give this live worship and praise concert at their church in Australia. I have five children from 12 yrs to 24 years, we all listen, enjoy and feast on the richness of the Holy Spirt that flows through this anointed group into our living room.  Buy it! You won't be sorry!",1055116800,,435,4.2926829268292686
7950663,5,B00005QIVR,"The first week I owned this DVD I fell asleep to it every night. Not that it will put you to sleep, but I simply cannot get enough of it. With each new Hillsongs release I think that they just cannot do any better, but they always amaze me once again. I bought my Mom this DVD for Mother's Day. She fell in love with mine while visiting. This treasure will truly take you into personal time with the Lord.",1021075200,2,405,4.075
7950664,5,B00005QIVR,"YOU ARE MY WORLD is the best album that Hillsong Music Australia has yet released. Musically it continues the slow evolution that past projects have shown, with more of a modern edge on tracks like ""God Is Great."" For the most part, however, it stays in the familiar musical vein that Darlene Zschech usually travels in. Most of the songs fall more in the power-ballad-to-mid-tempo range, with some nice exceptions like the driving ""Everything That Has Breath."" The songs are all quite melodic in the best sense of the word. It should be noted that Zschech hands over the lead worshiper reigns quite a few times here, to excellent results.
What makes YOU ARE MY WORLD stand out so much, though, is the superior writing. Lyrically the album has no misses, with choruses that are utterly worshipful, instantly catchy and memorable. These writers know how to pen songs that can immediately take you into the presence of God as well as stick around in your head for hours afterwards. The majority of these songs should easily become church standards in the coming years; in particular, ""Worthy Is the Lamb,"" which is one of the most powerful worship choruses I've ever heard.
The DVD for YOU ARE MY WORLD deserves its own recognition. The production values for this service/concert are head and shoulders above anything we've seen from a Hillsongs video before. Everything from the sets to the lighting create an ambiance that is warm and inviting and though that should be irrelevant to worship itself it's still nice to see from a critical standpoint. It all just LOOKS good and very professional. The DVD also includes music that is absent from the album release: ""Glorious,"" an extended version of ""Your Love Is Beautiful,"" and two acoustic reprises done at the end of the service. There are a few special features which are worth viewing. The making-of feature gave good insight on how this album was a new experience for the church, thanks to a change in venue, and the interviews were also interesting if not a bit too short. Production notes were short. The animated menus were nicely done.
I've never enjoyed the Hillsongs videos but YOU ARE MY WORLD successfully removed all of the small things which had caused that feeling. There's something a little strange about watching people worship on TV for me, but in the end this service was so genuine in its heart that I was drawn in and my small objections were quieted. In short, YOU ARE MY WORLD is an outstanding worship experience, and the DVD only makes it that much more so. Highly recommended. FIVE STARS.",1018742400,8,2566,4.794582392776523

7950666,5,B00005QIVR,"Hillsong Music Australia's newest live recording, You Are My World is a big step in musicianship from last year's, For This Cause.
They choose 14 tracks plus an a capella segment featuring the track title, You Are My World.

Your Love Is Beautiful- 5 of 5 stars.  This energetic Latin anthem of praise starts off the night like a clap of thunder.  The lyrics are catchy, the tune is very singable and also annoyingly catchy and the percussion segment just sweeps you off your feet in praise to the Lord. EXTRA- IT'S FUN TO WATCH TOO!!!!!

God Is Great- 5 of 5 stars.  Christian's alternative version to All The Small Things by Blink 182.  Full of rock and amazing vocals, this praise song gives the listener a tune to sing for the rest of the night.  Warning: DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE TITLE!

All Of My Days- 5 of 5 stars.  Perhaps one of the best tracks on the DVD!!  This song shows the heartbeat of the church.

Emmanuel- 3 of 5 stars.  Very monotonous and boring.  The same ol' thing over and over and over again.  It isn't that great to watch either.

You Stand Alone- 5 of 5 stars.  At this point, Mark and Steve step out and lift their voices in this beautiful anthem.

Irresistible- 5 of 5 stars.  Swirls of lights, a moving, captured crowd. TOO GOOD FOR WORDS.

You Are My World- 5 of 5 stars.  Marty does a great job at captivating the audience's attention.  Really moving to watch.  The choir moves in one, solid waves of worship.

Everything That Has Breath- 5 of 5 stars.  Darlene's smile and energy do it for this catchy wonderful 150 anthem.

Glorious- 6 of 5 stars- Amazing to watch.  Beautiful song.  It's pretty short though.

God So Loved-  5 of 5 stars.- How can Darlene move like that when she's pregnant.  Very simple and beautiful.

To You- 4 of 5 stars.- A little monotonous in tone.  But beautiful to watch and simply captivating.

Worthy Is The Lamb-  10,0000 of 5 stars. Miriam Webster sings this beautiful, unbelievbly gorgeous song of worship.  The best song on here by far.

Forever and Best Friend- 5 of 5 stars-  The jumping of the crowd gets you on your feet on Best Friend.  The whole team seems almost out of breath by the end.

A capella segment- 8 of 5 stars.  Moving!!! Very Moving.  It makes you wanna cry.

Overall, this 90 minute DVD will satisfy your soul and give you a look at the fastest growing church in the world.",1002067200,6,2359,4.390697674418605
