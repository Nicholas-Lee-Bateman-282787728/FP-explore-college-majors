For the money and if one has no or little concept of the Japanese atrocities that somehow have been forgotten and increasingly dwarfed by the ongoing mass media hysteria over a much smaller group of 'holocaust' victims, this video is a beginning of discovery that by some estimates, includes over a 100 million victims at the ruthless hands of the Japanese military that operated within the confines of totalitarianism; total authority by the state with a brutal pecking order from the top down that includes beatings by rank down to civilians and of course, attrocites to the lowest.... the prisoners that surrendered, rather than die in battle.

When younger and Japan was becoming the China of today with American imports (think Sony, etc.) I often wondered why the WW II military veterans of the Pacific carried an ongoing hatred of the Japanese; including their imported products, as none of this was taught in the public school system.

As an example, from accountings included in these videos, only about 5% of B-29 crews survived the Japanese camps and they would have died if the war had not ended... grown men down to less than 90 pounds, diseased and starving.

There are better videos, better live accountings, but they also cost substantially more and difficult to find.",1400630400,,1570,4.9581749049429655
