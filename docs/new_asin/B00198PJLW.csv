These movies were produced for television by a greetings card company. They were inspired by the famous stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. They were filmed in Qubec Canada to find a late 19th century background. They provide a new outlook on these classic stories. Is the new creation equal to the others? See the individual reviews for more details on each movie. Doyles stories were written at the end of the 19th century and are still being read today. Are the short stories still used in high school literature English courses? It takes age to understand the point of some of them. I suspect Doyle used now long-forgotten true crimes for his stories. This is true for The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Valley of Fear. These portray Watson as a much older man instead of being closer in age.

The Hound of the Baskervilles. Sir Charles Baskerville died outside in the night. A new heir arrived from Canad. Doctor Mortimer visits Sherlock Holmes, he fears for the life of Sir Henry. The investigation tells about life in a small rural village in Devonshire. In the end Holmes and Watson foil the villain and save the life of Sir Henry.

The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire. A monk was murdered. Is there danger from the bats that fly at night? Holmes investigates and the mystery is solved. This is an original story and ended the series. What is good is not new, what is new is not good.

The Royal Scandal. A burglar stole a photograph negative that would embarrass a Royal Prince. Sherlock is assigned the job of retrieving it. The body of a diplomat is found besides a railroad track, confidential papers are missing from his desk at the Foreign Office. Sherlock recovers the papers and returns them. We, too, have out diplomatic secrets. This new story was created from two original stories (A Scandal in Bohemia and The Bruce-Partington Plans).",1454889600,,1945,4.6950146627565985
