8685565,5,B00OYW8FJ8,"I was hesitant to purchase this DVD due to the price, but it did not disappoint! This DVD is excellent. The instructor gives clear descriptions of poses with several variations. Her voice is calm and soothing. I hope she comes out with another one with more poses.",1517875200,,264,4.638297872340425
8685566,5,B00OYW8FJ8,This is the first restorative dvd that doesn't play music.  I LOVE IT!  At first I thought it might be strange but it really helps me to relax.  She gives cues that I haven't heard before which will help me in the future doing certain poses.  The only thing I wish is there was another sequence to do.  It has now become my go to dvd.,1508371200,3,334,4.0
