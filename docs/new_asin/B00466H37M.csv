4264753,3,B00466H37M,"I just recieved the ninth year DVD, opened it to peruse the episode list to pick out my favorite and lo and behold, there isn't one!  What? At first, I thought maybe it was a mistake until I read another review saying the same thing!  Am I supposed to just know the order?  How chinzy is this?  I love L & O, but this really is bad.  That's why the low star rating.  The picture on the front is correct, however. C'mon, Universal, you can do better than this!!!!  Probably no extras, either, but I don't know because there isn't any listing!",1323216000,16,541,4.245098039215686
4264754,3,B00466H37M,"OK.

I'm none too happy that they released the whole set after having released them in a trickle.  But I got over it.  Ultimately I know which L&O episodes I like - it's really based on the characters.  Lenny Briscoe (Of course), Jack McCoy (of course), Ed Green, Ray Curtis, Abbie Carmichael.  That's it, for the most part.  So I picked up Season 6-8 as the precursor to the ""Abbie Carmichael Era"".  Then it was a LONNNNNNNG wait until season 9.  Well I got it...and while I love the season, I'm disappointed in the packaging.

If you've owned any of the previous you already know what to expect.  A hard box to keep the discs in.  Three separate thin cases with the episodes.  Custom artwork on the front.  Synopsis of every episode within.  NONE of that is found here.  Instead we get a single ghetto plastic DVD case with some flimsy tray-stack-flip inside.  No inserts, nothing.  Just a bunch of discs.  Hell, you can't even really tell it's the 9th season, the front cover is bland compared to 6-8. What's worse the DVDs have no cover art whatsoever, just some lettering/numbering over the reflective plastic.  It's like they didn't even try.  Almost felt like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat-Cultural-Learnings-of-America-for-Make-Benefit-Glorious-Nation-of-Kazakhstan-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000MMMT9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;all over again...fresh off a bootlegger's BitTorrent (but not really).

The back paragraph is embarrassing: ""Following his character's....Benjamin Bratt says goodbye to Detective Reynaldo ""Rey"" Curtis...joining him are iconic series regulars Jerry Orbach....""  Just a run on description that doesn't even compute.  It really means to say that this is Bratt's last season with Law & Order; mentioning Orbach is pointless, because he kept on going for more seasons until he went to Law & Order: Trial By Jury just before his death.  Then it mentions Angie Harmon's addition to the team but refers to her as a ""series regular"" in the same sentence as above, yet says ""...in her first season"".

It's clear NBC/Universal rushed this out the door to meet a deadline.  I don't know why it took them so long to get this done, there's nothing that should have justified the delay.  My guess: They prioritized the massive set to make more money.

I can't say skip this but if you haven't bought any of them, you might as well just get the set.  If you've bought some I personally thought seasons 9-12 were some of the best, but be prepared for lackluster packaging.",1323129600,31,2654,5.3125

4264884,5,B00466H37M,"The subject line refers only to what everyone else here is complaining about--the lack of an episode guide, or, for that matter, quality packaging in this season's DVD release.

I made a comment on the review written by Pemberly of North Texas. But it was long & people don't read comments here, so I'm cutting and pasting it below.

Wow, when I was reading your review, I kept checking to see if I was reading the one I wrote. But I never wrote a review about this season, specifically, & I don't think I've ever reviewed L&O on Amazon because up until recently, I gave up trying to find DVD sets for the seasons I wanted.

But I have expressed a nearly identical view several times to MGM-Universal, underscoring the fact that if they didn't start releasing L&O seasons, people like me would LITERALLY be dead before they could have the chance to buy!

I have now purchased seasons 6 through 9, which just arrived today (the 9th, that is). This bloc is, to me, the best writing & the most imaginative story lines of the seasons up through 11. Like you, I find Elisabeth Rohm INSUFFERABLE. I did write a review somewhere around here where I said I'd seen her on some documentary about female actors & she was the only one who represented L&O in that show. She actually had the nerve to say that she thought she was the best female ADA of the entire show, the prettiest, smartest, etc. Honest to god, I had to stifle my gag reflex on hearing that.

It took me a while to warm up to Angie Harmon. But she got me right in the heart with her prosecution of the rape victim who had the prison guard murdered for what he did to her. That was one of the best episodes of the entire series.

There's this thing about attractive actors & how they are often chosen for their looks, rather then their talent--just like politicians. The women--Jill Hennessy, Carey Lowell & Angie Harmon were all gorgeous, which is one attribute that prejudices my opinion. But as far as I'm concerned, up until they hired that aforementioned dolt, the casting folks were batting 1000. To combine gorgeous with genius, they did the best job on television, without including Kyra Sedgwick in THE CLOSER. I love seeing women depicted like this--brains & beauty. Makes me proud to be a woman, even if I'm not as pretty as they are.

But I also loved every choice of male actors, from the pilot through McCoy with Harmon. I used to think the early episodes weren't as good because they weren't as slick, but eventually I realized I was wrong about that. Careful re-watchings of seasons One through Five revealed the fabulously subtle, prescient plotlines that really set the bar for crime drama. No one, again, except the ensemble in the first six seasons of THE CLOSER, has ever come close to that bar.

L&O's ""evil twin"" is HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, of which I have all the seasons. I loved the collaborations there. When Jon Seda says, ""I can't prove it, but I'm pretty sure that in a previous life, Briscoe & Munch were married,"" I just cracked up. Great pairings there & better interrogations than L&O because of the tag team of Andre Braugher & Kyle Secor. There simply has never been a better team than those two, with their perfect timing & mesmerizing postures.

The writing on HOMICIDE, however, never rose to the level of the writing on L&O or, for that matter, THE CLOSER. Still, these three crime dramas & their personnel draw me back again & again.

Of course, people don't buy DVDs to watch just once & throw away. I watch these shows over & over, just like I play my favorite music over & over, & eat the same food & hike the same mountains & adore the same kid I gave birth to 35 years ago. People think that's weird, but why? If I'm going to invest time in watching the television, I'm not going to rot my brain on ""reality"" shows. L&O is more reality than any of those stupid things.

Oh, I wanted to mention something about delays in DVD releases. Sometimes the holdup is not the tv producers themselves. The problem is getting the rights to the music they inlcude. Even though L&O rarely stuck a Beatles' song into some pensive pondering by one of the detectives on HOMICIDE, or in another favorite & unavailable show, COLD CASE, there are always layers of copyright viewers may not notice--from singing the still-copyrighted ""Happy Birthday"" to including a Chopin nocturne being played by a fictional orchestra (always performed by an artist whose work is copyrighted). Making sure everyone gets a slice of the pie is job security for a lot of producer's assistants. Sometimes an artist will not cooperate, period, which means dead air or an alternative song pasted in.

Leaving out an episode guide in a DVD set is criminal. I will have to fall back on my favorite source for episode guides, [...]. They list them from last to first, but they've really done yeoman's work, documenting episodes for hundreds of television shows.",1398124800,,4923,4.5754824063564135

4264926,4,B00466H37M,"The studios love to complain about copyright infringement.  However, given a legal monopoly on some great content, Universal releases a set of DVDs whose presentation would embarrass a pirate shop working out of the back streets of Hong Kong.

No track listing.  No description of the episodes.  No cast list. Seriously, it would have taken an intern half an hour to print one up.  What's going on, Hollywood?

As for the episodes themselves, the quality of the writing is still mostly up there with the series at its peak.  If Carey Lowell had stayed on as Jamie Ross, this would probably have joined seasons 6-8 as the most enjoyable of all.  Unfortunately, Angie ""vocal fry"" Harmon is not a taste that I've been able to acquire.  Your mileage may vary.

There are many highlights, but particular mention goes to:
 - ""Empire"" (Julia Roberts joins her squeeze-du-jour Bratt in an enjoyable but nonsensical plot),
 - ""Sideshow"" (L+O's take on Ken Starr, here accompanied by its difficult-to-find -- in every sense -- sequel from ""Homicide: Life on the Street"".  Briscoe + Munch = comedy nirvana),
 - ""Venom"" (a great plot featuring a mother-and-son crime team),
 - ""True North"" (involving international relations and the death penalty), and
 - ""Refuge"" (McCoy takes on the Russian and Colombian mafia in a two-parter -- a little over-the-top but still fun).

After the Russian mafia has been put away, we move onto the real news: Curtis is quitting to look after his sick wife.  This seems almost as tacked-on as Logan's exit in season 5.  It's also a shame:  while he could sometimes be rather annoying, I feel that Curtis had a chalk-and-cheese chemistry with Briscoe that Logan and Green both lacked.

In any event, until Netflix picks up this season, this is your only legal way to get some great TV (short of setting your VCR for the TNT channel at 4am).  And it may be your only way of ever seeing Sideshow part 2.  I guess we will have to forgive the lousy presentation.

4264929,5,B00466H37M,"It doesn't get any better than this.  The combination of Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston could carry any show.  What makes this show so great is that the other actors were far better than the B Team on any other show, and better than the A Team on many shows.  The story line is that the first half of the show deals with discovering and solving the crime (Jerry Orbach) and the second half of the show deals with the prosecution of the crime (Sam Waterston).  The show routinely deals with serious public issues which make the show seem more realistic.  Law & Order is not the usual shoot-'em-up cop show.",1382227200,,605,4.414414414414415

4264955,1,B00466H37M,"I wanted to buy all the remaining seasons of Law and Order to complete my collection.  I bought seasons 9 and 10, then 11 and 12.  When I played 9, couldn't understand that there were, out of 4 episodes, only 2 which would play, and it was the same way with all the discs of the 4 Seasons. Unless there were 5 episodes--with them I was able to view 3 episodes.
Spent a lot of time trying to figure out why all those episodes were missing.  What made it harder was that there were no summaries of the episodes. These would have helped to figure out what was happening.
I am in the process of returning all--Seasons 9, 10, 11, and 12.  For the most popular series on TV, the makers of the Law and Order series did a sloppy job--very disappointing!!
Amazon is refunding my money.",1371254400,,776,4.258503401360544
4264956,3,B00466H37M,"One of the biggest problems with this season on DVD is the fact that there is no episode list included and no summary by title on the disc. I had to go to Wikipedia to find out what to expect here. The episodes are very good and highly emotional. I was particularly worked up about one in which bounty hunters are revealed to be legally above the law. Another was infuriating because it dealt with neo-Nazis. As in the past several seasons, there were cross-over episodes that were tied to episodes of Homicide: Life on the Streets. Season 9 marks the entrance of talented actress Angie Harmon as new ADA Abbie Carmichael. Harmon continues the tradition of extremely beautiful ADAs to complement the mostly male cast, but her husky voice stands out from the rest. It also marks the exit of Benjamin Bratt as Det. Reynaldo ""Rey"" Curtis. If it weren't for the lack of synopses or episode list, I would have given this 4 stars, but it's ridiculous to have a 5-DVD set without the slightest index or summaries.",1370304000,,1006,4.594444444444444

4264959,5,B00466H37M,"So glad I bought this season. I LOVE it. Angie Harmon enters the show and the show takes on a whole new dynamic, these are the best of the whole series. I would recommend this to anyone",1363737600,,185,4.027027027027027
4264960,5,B00466H37M,"A lot like season's 5 and 6, this seasons starts off with a new member to the cast and ends with one leaving. And it goes on like this for the nest three seasons. We are introduced to a new ADA named Abbie Carmichael. A Texan who recently transferred from the Narcotic's Division in DA's office, ADA Carmichael appears to be more conservative than her predecessor. The episodes are just as thought provoking as ever. Racial profiling leading to murder, challenging freedom speech, debate over embryos and probably the most memorable, the Russian mob as seen in the two part episode, Refuge. Speaking of two-parters? This season marks the third and final time, Law & Order crosses over with Homicide: Life On The Streets. This time, the 27th detectives and The ADA's investigate the murder a woman with ties to Washington. There are a lot of shady dealings in this episode mainly caused by the now defunct ""Independent Counsel."" But this will not be John Munch's last appearance in Law & Order or anything remotely related. Rey's departure leaves his colleges in the squad more emotional than Mike's departure, because one: Logan's short-fuse got him demoted and two: Both Van Buren and Briscoe knew Curtis longer than than they Logan, who by the way returns in a TV that was released towards the start of this season (but sadly is not included on the this DVD.) The only flaws to this product are the single-disk boxes, the lack of foreign subtitles(which do not matter to me), the lack of episode descriptions and the fact the the Homicide episode was located on the first disk when the Law & Order episode it crosses over with is on Disk 3. But do not let these trivial things get in the way. Season 9 is definitely and season worth watching over and over.",1363132800,,1758,4.674193548387096
4264961,4,B00466H37M,"Other than a change in terminology of the product (Season 8 versus the Ninth Year), Law & Order continues to be the best show out there. But once again, I have to deduct one star due to the cheap packaging and the lack of extras.
The only plus is it does include subtitles for those of us with impaired hearing, (unlike what Universal did with L & O Criminal Intent being farmed out to Shout Factory for seasons 7-10., who stripped it of subtitles and used obsolete Closed Captioning, which is incompatible with HD TV's).
The critical content has been well described by many others here, so I will not take up space rehashing what others have already done very well before me.",1361750400,,676,4.504065040650406
4264962,5,B00466H37M,"Because I am a HUGE fan of Benjamin Bratt (hence my screen-name!) the seasons where he appears (Seasons 6, 7, 8 & 9) are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITES (though since I really like Jill Hennessy/Claire Kincaid, I LOVE Seasons 4 and 5 as well) of the ENTIRE 20-season series of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order/dp/B005HU0TBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order</a>

Unfortunately Benjamin Bratt left the show at the end of this season (with his character, Reynaldo ""Rey"" Curtis leaving the police department to care for his wife who was suffering from Multiple Sclerosis) and following his departure at the end of Season 9, there ae no longer ANY seasons that I love IN ITS ENTIRETY though there ARE individual random episodes, here & there, from later seasons (Season 10 and onwards) that I DO like.

There are some seasons of Law & Order which are my favorites, and other seasons which I do NOT really like -- and its all based on the particular cast of characters (and actors/actresses) during that season.

I have many FAVORITE characters on the show, including Rey Curtis (obviously!), Jamie Ross, Claire Kincaid, Anita van Buren, Lennie Briscoe & Jack McCoy (of course!), Mike Logan, Abbie Carmichael, Ben Stone and Adam Schiff, and I LOVE the seasons they are in. But by the same token, I HATE Arthur Branch, Kevin Bernard, Cyrus Lupo & Ed Green, and I don't really like the characters of Michael Cutter, Serena Southerlyn, Alexandra Borgia, Connie Rubirosa, Nick Falco, Joe Fontana or Nina Cassady very much, so I HATE (or don't care very much for) the seasons that they are in.

Also, though I liked the CHARACTERS of Max Greevey, Phil Cerreta, Don Cragen & Paul Robinette, because there were NO women characters in the main cast, during  the seasons in which they appeared (Seasons 1, 2, and 3) the show was way too male-heavy/male-centric. Which is why I do NOT like the first three seasons of the show, and its the reason that even though I liked Greevey, Cerreta & Robinette, and I LOVE Don Cragen on Law & Order SVU, I was glad when their characters were replaced with females (Claire Kincaid for Paul Robinette and Anita van Buren for Don Cragen)

So basically, I do NOT like either the first three seasons of the show, nor *most* of the episodes after Season 9 (though there are individual episodes after that, which I DO like!). Seasons 4-9 are my favorites in this series, and barring any massive price reduction and/or multi-season ""bundling"" discounts, they are the ONLY seasons I plan to get on DVD.

Out of the 6 seasons (4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9) I plan to get, so far, I have gotten the DVD sets for Seasons 7, 8 and 9 (though I did not get them from Amazon -- I can't remember now, exactly where I got them, probably Best Buy [or Circuit City, when they were still in business], or Kmart or the like) and Season 9 is among my favorites! I just LOVE this season & these DVDs!

Aside from the lack of a list of the episodes on each disc (if I could have, I would've deducted HALF a STAR for that. But since its only possible to deduct whole stars, and the lsck of an episode list is so minor [since one can easily get an episode guide online and/or edit it in terms of which episodes are on which disc before printing off a paper copy!] I don't think an entire star deduction is warranted so I did not deduct ANY stars for that) this DVD set is GREAT!

Even though other reviewers have posted complaints about Disc 1 and or 2 in this set being defective (like with freezing on the Universal logo) I have NOT had that problem, or any other problem with either Disc 2 or the other 4 discs in the set. All of the DVD discs in my DVD set work PERFECTLY so far (knock wood!)

Also, though other reviewers have complained about the DVD case/packaging for this set, I do not have much problem with DVD cases like the one that holds the Season 9 set and compared to other styles of DVD set cases, I think this kind of case is among the better (if not one of the best) ones out there!

In fact, I actually PREFER the style of a single plastic DVD case (like the one that holds Season 9) instead of the cardboard DVD box holding individual plastic DVD cases (like those for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Seventh-Year/dp/B002UOMGWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Seventh Year</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-Season-Eight/dp/B002BWQ4C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: Season Eight</a>) because I am kind of anal about my DVD sets, and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. Which is why I'd much rather have this kind of DVD case, which doesn't get edgewear, shelfwear and corner-wear & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!

This 5-disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Ninth-Year/dp/B00466H37M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Ninth Year</a>&nbsp;DVD set contains all 24 episodes of the 1998-99 season including the crossover episode with the award-winning series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homicide-Life-on-the-Street/dp/B002BLNGTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homicide: Life on the Street</a>, titled ""Sideshow: Part Two"". As far as I know, the ""Sideshow"" episode was the LAST of the 3 occasions of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order/dp/B005HU0TBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order</a>&nbsp;having a ""crossover episode"" with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homicide-Life-on-the-Street/dp/B002BLNGTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homicide: Life on the Street</a>.

Just like in other seasons, the episodes in Season 9 are full of gripping cases that are often ""ripped from the headlines"" (like for example, the episode ""DWB"" which was based on a combination of both the racially-motivated dragging murder in Jasper, Texas and the police brutality case of Abner Louima) and notable guest stars like Julia Roberts (in the episode, ""Empire""), and Mark Linn-Baker from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perfect-Strangers/dp/B00005JNIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perfect Strangers</a>&nbsp;(in the episode, ""Ambitious"") as well as Richard Belzer in his best-known role of Detective John Munch on ""Homicide - Life on the Streets"" & several other series.

Along with these great guest stars are the EXCELLENT series regulars including Benjamin Bratt (who, in the two-part season finale, ""Refuge"", says goodbye to the 27th Precinct and Detective Reynaldo ""Rey"" Curtis, the role that earned him his Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series), Jerry Orbach, S. Epatha Merkerson, Sam Waterston, and Steven Hill, together with Angie Harmon who joins&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order/dp/B005HU0TBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order</a>&nbsp;in her first season as ADA Abbie Carmichael, replacing Carey Lowell who played Jamie Ross, and left the show at the end of Season 8.

Even though I LOVE nearly all (if not, ALL) of the episodes in this season, I'd have to say that my MOST FAVORITE episode this season is the season premiere episode, ""Cherished"". Other favorites include ""DWB"", ""Bait"", ""Punk"", ""Hate"", ""Hunters, ""Harm"", ""Tabula Rasa"", and the two-part season finale, ""Refuge"".

However, even thoough I do LOVE this Season 9 DVD set, I do have ONE quibble there are NO Special Features or Bonuses (other than the 2nd part of the 2-part crossover episode with ""Homicide - Life on the Streets""). NO deleted scenes, NO bloopers, no commentary, no interviews with cast or producers/directors, NOTHING and its disappointing!

Nevertheless this is still a great (though very BASIC) set -- and even though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order/dp/B005HU0TBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order</a>&nbsp;airs often in syndication and/or on cable, since there are 456 episodes total in the 20-season series, the chance of having a desired episode airing at any given time is very slim (and for those with Netflix service, the Netflix Streaming only has seasons 1-8 available). Which is why, even with its lack of extras, this DVD set is so GREAT!",1361059200,,8503,5.625292740046838
4264963,4,B00466H37M,"I decided to start collecting the series since we enjoy the shows and if one is laid up and day time TV is not your thing, you can pop in a disc and forget about commericals!",1359417600,,174,3.861111111111111
4264984,5,B00466H37M,"I bought this Law and Order season for my sister as a Christmas gift.  The company delivered exactly what it promised. So I have no idea as to the content, my sister said she felt thrilled to get these DVDs.

The Menu system is affected too making the a bunch of clicking and jumping sounds! Also I read the comments and I agree an episode description would be nice. I have to guess and end up changing DVD's because once it starts I realize that I've seen this one already or just don't like these episodes. The Writers didn't put much effort into this one just like Season 8 most of them aren't thought through and don't make sense. C'mon guys I'm a Fan but gimme something interesting and STOP being lazy.

This one is just over 1/2"" thick. I'm surprised that, among all the complaints, no-one has pointed out that this is real progress and marvelous for so much material.

I totally agree that the lack of episode summaries, or even an episode list, is a serious drawback, so serious I almost gave this 3 stars. This could so easily be handled with the sort of paper insert you get with, say, Seinfeld or early Family Guy - the space and the prongs to hold it are right there on the inside cover! I hope they do this for Season 10.

As to the material, I think Seasons 9 and 10 are the very best apart from the first four - they have the wonderful Abby but do not have the awful Nora. This tipped the balance for me into making it a 4 star.",1332547200,,838,4.036144578313253

Something to think about, you have 30 days to find all the problems, or you are STUCK with them. Usually, there is just one episode that has a problem. Here, the viewer cannot access the material on disc 2.

I have had a very good experience with Amazon over the years, but a much less pleasant one with Universal. Their DVDs of the various Law and Order series, have far too many problems, sometimes it seems like the Law & Order discs are made to 3rd world standards, apparently no check is made to see if the disc even works or not.",1325980800,4,817,4.2709677419354835
4265027,2,B00466H37M,"With the first two reviews I read here, I TOTALLY agree. I got online just now to say the same things about the packaging! What a total rip-off! I just got my shipment an hour or so ago and couldn't believe that they couldn't release this season with the same packaging as previous ones. First they put all seasons subsequent to season one in different packaging. This I could handle because I actually didn't like the big fold-out format of the first year (I paid $60 for that when it was first released!). But then to release season nine in this crappy plastic case at the same over-blown price as the previous releases just makes me mad.

I am really sick that they have, as someone said, ""trickled-out"" the seasons and also as mentioned, finally released a whole set after all the original fans have waited and waited and bought them on a piece-meal basis; and now have ripped us off again with this cheap garbage. It's disgusting. And I suppose season 10, which I pre-purchased will be the same cheap garbage. I have always intended to only buy seasons 1-11, because it all went seriously down-hill after Abbie left (could not STAND Elizabeth Rohm!!!!) and now I'm really glad I only have one more season to buy. After that I'll have serious pause before I ever give them another cent. I am actually tempted to cancel my pre-order but I have waited for the Abbie years ever since she left the show! UGH!!

Someone suggested contacting the company; please tell me how to do so and I will be glad to lodge a complaint with them.

For anyone interested in opinions on the episodes themselves, I've already stated that the years while Angie Harmon was on the show were probably my favorite over-all. Because I know I like the most of the episodes, I gave my review 2 stars when I was prepared to give only 1 due to the crappy way I think the public has been treated over these releases. This is the only television series I have ever collected with the exception of the ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL series. None of the spin-offs ever got my interest and that has been another gripe of mine: that they would release all the seasons of all the other colon shows much more quickly than they did the original, and best, series.",1325635200,5,2225,4.502475247524752

With no list of episodes it's a waste of time to try and track this down, I thought it would be one of the regular episodes on the discs esp since the back cover specifically mentions it.

4265031,4,B00466H37M,"Glad it is out. But like people are saying. Cheap Packing and No Episode List.( You can get that online).
Just look up Law and Order Episodes. Also Season 10 will be out in Feb 2012.. I hope it will not be a cheap set like this one is. But I will be glad it have them as the come out. I have 1-9 and realy don't want to cash out $450.00 for the set.
So lets go and have one more season out every three months.
I am looking to get them all.",1324166400,,439,3.6808510638297873
4265032,4,B00466H37M,"First things first: It's L&O and the show quality is great. Therefore, this is a review of the PRODUCT, not the show or the episodes.

Most of the complaints I've seen on here deal with the packaging and/or the missing episode list.  The missing episode list is annoying, no doubt. Easy enough to fix by printing one off of the Inter-webs.  The packaging otherwise doesn't bother me. I have other shows that have the type of flip tray featured in this packaging. Since I take good care of my DVDs AND their cases, this doesn't bother me.

My one real complaint is the way they set up the crossover episode with ""Homicide."" Instead of keeping them on one disc, after watching the ""L&O"" episode on Disc 3, you have to go back do Disc 1 for the episode as a Bonus Feature. It would have made more sense to keep them on the same disc.",1324166400,3,830,4.335483870967742
4265033,4,B00466H37M,"After I received the long awaited 9th DVD last week I was quite disappointed to discover that there was no episode summary included in each disk as was the case with seasons 1-8 nor was there any printed list and summary included with the DVDs. How cheap is that ?! The manufacturer could have easily taken a little time and little cost to include list of episodes and a brief summary with the set. I was able to locate a Season 9 list almost immediately on line at Wikipedia. I hope that when Season 10 and beyond are individually released that this ""oversight"" does not occur again...but I am not going to hold my breath.",1323907200,14,623,4.426086956521739

8417084,5,B00466H37M,"Season nine is another great season of Law and Order with Briscoe and Curtis catching the criminals and Carmichael and McCoy trying them. Angie Harmon (Abby Carmichael) is a great replacement for Cary Lowell (Jamie Ross) as Jack McCoy's assistant. Great crime drama, maybe the best Crime Drama ever on television. I love the NY attitude and accent; there is plenty of it in season nine.",1507852800,,386,4.863636363636363
