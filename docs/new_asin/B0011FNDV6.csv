It looks better than a DVD but not by much. It would have been nice to see it remastered to the quality of Paprika. I do like the packaging of the set as well. It plays on my US Xbox One just fine.",1483401600,9,333,3.911764705882353
8241661,4,B0011FNDV6,The one problem with this version is there are no subtitles.  That is the only reason this got four stars otherwise it would receive a perfect score.  Absolute masterpiece of cinema,1351382400,29,181,4.806451612903226
8241662,5,B0011FNDV6,"I won't tell you how this anime is, as you can easily read it in many reviews. I'll talk what you'll get.

This Perfect Blue is the spec ed DVD (there is also the Bluray). It has the remastered DVD, but no english subtitles. Only Japanese audio. Plus... you'll get the complete storyboard of the anime. This is the actual treasure of the boxset.",1317168000,,345,4.390625
