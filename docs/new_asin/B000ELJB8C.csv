8111002,3,B000ELJB8C,"This is 'exotic car porn' pure and simple.  If you're not familiar with these movies, the guy who makes them, Rob Ferretti, owns a high end car rental in NY.  For the right price (i think $950+ or something) you get to go out with him and a small group and drive like 5 or 6 of these exotics.  Most of the videos are shot with him and his close buddies/business partners and its basically just them beating these awesome cars on public highways, doing burnouts, racing, etc.  Personally, the guy is kind of a rich douche, but he is funny at times and must have some judge in his pocket or something because he gets pulled over constantly... sometimes only miles apart!  The things he says to cops are hilarious.  Also, you get to see some of these exotics after Rob gets a call that one of his customers totaled it... sometimes you get to witness it first hand in the videos.

All in all these videos get better as the series progresses.  I've seen them all and my favorite is ""On the Run""... the beast of a Ford GT in that video is worth the price of admission alone.  His vette is pretty sweet as well... huge horsepower monster.  In all fairness, i have to give Ferretti his due because the guy does have balls.  He has no problem holding these rockets to the floor... and 170mph is the standard.  No one can question he pushes these things to the limit. Since the cars are what your renting these flicks for anyway, if you're not into the 'douch-baggery' simply fast forward through those parts.  In regards to video quality... the camera shots are GREAT! However the video quality is not high definition (which is disappointing). I equate it to watching VHS or slightly above. The techno music he cuts some of it with is not my taste at all...  but i could only stomach the techno because of the 'engine music' parts... which are quite good.",1346889600,,1846,4.423076923076923
