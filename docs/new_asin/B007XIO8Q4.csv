8522929,5,B007XIO8Q4,"Bleak and nihilistic masterpiece, one of Edwin Brienen's earlier cinematic efforts. A group of failed performance artists try to set up an erotic show in Berlin. Their hedonistic self-destruction kills every possibility to succeed, and they lose themselves in drugs and sexual excesses. The film is merciless and shows no signs of hope and joy. Brienen's Berlin is a dark gutter of misanthropy and disorder, a place filled with mentally disturbed freaks, sex addicts, serial killers, pimps and dealers. The lack of emotions and empathy can be a huge turn-off, but Brienen employs a radical and unique cinematic language that makes it worth. Starring Fassbinder actor Peter Kern (Fox and His Friends, Mother Kustes Goes to Heaven) and Jean-Louis Costes (Gaspard Noe's Irreversible). Not for the faint of heart.",1487808000,,809,5.27906976744186
8522930,1,B007XIO8Q4,"Unless you are familiar with other works of this director, I would not recommend purchasing or viewing this movie.  Any presumed plot is extremely disguised.  The movie is full of loud music and iconoclastic, graphic and disturbing scenes lumped randomly and usually disconnected. I would class this as the worst movie I have ever watched and the only reason I persisted to the end was so that I could intelligently write this review.  If I was a retailer of movies, I would not stock this item.",1447718400,,495,4.732558139534884
