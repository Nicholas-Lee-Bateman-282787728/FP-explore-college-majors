5038891,2,B006Z7Z3L8,"The morality of executions has been debated for over 2,500 years probably longer.  This is another one of those.

What it is a real-life story of a prisoner about to be executed. It has been done so many times, I question do we need another one?

In this case, we have a man who killed a person for a car. This film examines the people who knew the victim, the people associated with the murderer about to be executed and a little on the state people that are going to kill him. I did not find anything, particularly deep or original. Some are interesting.

The man about to be killed looks like a nice guy. He thinks after execution that he is going to go to heaven, which I thought was interesting. Overall I think much could be cut out with no loss to the viewer.",1333584000,6,766,4.226027397260274
5038892,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"Werner Herzog's second documentary of 2011 shows him at his least abstract. His previous doc,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cave-of-Forgotten-Dreams/dp/B005HP2J66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cave of Forgotten Dreams</a>, showed him experimenting with 3D and was a pretty straight-forward effort until the epilogue, but Into the Abyss is Herzog at his most focused. A rarity, he never appears onscreen and his iconic voice provides no narration, only appearing to quietly ask questions from behind the camera. Into the Abyss is populated with traditional Herzogian figures, people so delightfully weird they couldn't possibly be fiction, but the subject matter is far from delightful. Rushed into theatres after a surging interest in capital punishment, the film profiles two convicted killers, one's impending death by lethal injection, their crime, the climate of capital punishment, and those acquainted with them in various ways.

It's not Herzog's style to make the documentary equivalent of a persuasive essay and although he states that he's against capital punishment, his film makes no such statement. It looks at each person, presents each detail, and allows us to interpret this information ourselves. As you can expect from the work of this great filmmaker, the questions we're left with are far greater than a simple vote of ""for"" or ""against"" in regards to the death penalty.

Michael Perry is on death row for a triple homicide in Conroe, Texas. His accomplice, Jason Burkett, is serving a life sentence and is not eligible for parole until 2041. There is no implication of doubt over their guilt despite declarations of innocence, particularly from Perry. Both admit to being involved, but Perry pins the guilt on Burkett, while Burkett does likewise to Perry. We learn that the reason for the murders (as if there could be one) was a Camaro that the two wanted to steal. This led to the murder of the owner, her teenage son, and his friend. A senseless act if ever there was one.

Both Perry and Burkett appear, answering the direct, curious, and sometimes difficult questions posed by Herzog. Aside from these two, Herzog speaks with relatives of the victims. One woman, who lost her mother and brother that night, recounts the tragedy and how nearly everyone in her family died in a six-year period, including the family dog. Another, who lost his brother, discusses the pain of that loss. Melyssa Thompson-Burkett is a young woman who married Burkett in prison and is pregnant with his child. When confronted with the fact that their only physical contact is hand-holding during visits, a few feet from a guard, she's ambivalent about the circumstances. Then there's Captain Fred who, after overseeing more than 100 executions, quit his job at the cost of losing his pension because he simply couldn't do it anymore.

The interviews range from fascinating to tragic to quietly amusing. When Herzog travels to the little town of (get ready) Cut and Shoot, Texas he talks to a former acquaintance of Jason Burkett. The man, illiterate and fascinated by the German director he's speaking with, calmly recounts a story of how Burkett stabbed him with a screwdriver, ""about that long"" and, unphased, he skipped the hospital to go to work. When Herzog observes the man's girlfriend's name tattooed on his arm, he asks what will become of it if the relationship fails. ""I guess I'll have to add `sucks' right there,"" he says, or something to that effect. This sequence is fascinating in the miraculous way Herzog illustrates the man as a heroic figure in this town; a blue-collar, hard-worker, who tossed aside a knife during a fight so he'd be able to go home to his kids. He's one of those personalities just tailor-made for a Herzog documentary.

The most heartbreaking subject is Jason's father Delbert Burkett, also serving a life sentence in prison. He blames himself for Jason's poor upbringing and reflects on how his poor choices and neglect as a parent caused Jason to turn out the way he did. The truth and eloquent, hardened emotion that Herzog captures here could easily be the inspiration behind the film's title; it's here that Herzog actually enters the abyss of his subject's soul.

Into the Abyss is seemingly light on Herzog's not quite fiction, not quite factual ""ecstatic truth"" approach to documentary filmmaking, described by Herzog as ""a merely superficial truth."" It's one of his most quietly provoking films, silently moving from interview to interview and just looking. If any filmmaker is more qualified to go into the abyss simply to look at what's down there, it's Herzog. This latest effort is a fascinating exercise in what you can find if you just look.

Due to its lugubrious pacing and subject matter, the pacing is slow at times but it's hard to lose interest. This is the rare kind of documentary that will make you both think and feel. There are lot of questions and a lot of possible answers, but Herzog leaves us to choose which one we feel is closest to the right one. Other directors would have chosen a potentially innocent inmate and created a film based on the question of their guilt or innocence. By taking on two obviously guilty subjects, telling one of them ""I don't have to like you,"" and examining the crime, the punishment, and the senselessness of it all, Herzog has substantially broadened the discussion. It may not have any immediate startling impact, but it will stay with you. It's one of the most important documentaries of 2011 and further evidence that Herzog is one of the most indispensable living documentarians.

5038928,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"I love the way Herzog tells a story. You'll find the facts embedded within the individuals' stories. This is about crime and punishment, but , Herzog always finds a way to make his films about people. Some of the elements of the crime are almost unbelievable. How? you ask. And, why? The ignorance of Youth? Desperation? Lack of self-worth? Physical detriments to the brain or learned behavior causing lack of empathy? Drugs? Probably all of the above. Still, as it unfolds, you see how the crime affected people all down the line: from relatives, to prison guards, to pastors. He doesn't try to paint a picture of the people in his film; he allows them to do that.. He is anti-death penalty, but he doesn't try to change anyone's mind. He allows you to view humanity, loss of life, pained regrets, denial of responsibility for your own assessment.
A question that has been around for eons: what causes brutality & stupidity? Can it be addressed before the worst happens? And once the worst happens, what is the best way to address it.
And why in one of the most civilized countries on earth do we continue to have relatively high numbers of senseless crime even when the death penalty has been around a long time?
If you have the least bit of curiosity & emotion, Herzog's films seem to make you question your own thoughts & ideas for days & months after viewing. Not for someone just wanting a good old 'shoot 'em up'- but I am thankful for documentaries such as these.
As an aside: another film that is hauntingly engaging is Herzog's ""Grizzly Man"" . Particularly if you're an animal lover and intrigued by people who march to their own drum.",1424995200,,1645,4.617747440273037

5038931,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"Werner Herzog is probably the most kaleidsocopic filmmaker the world of cinema has ever had.

His multiple concerns span from ""Even dwarfs started small"", cult documentals such as ""Fata Morgana"", ""Gesualdo"", ""The cave of forgotten dreams"" and this potent straight- to-heart docudrama that reflects more than a simple statement about the capital punishment.

Herzog with absolute objectivity allows that victims, murderers and relatives talk by themselves. His inner thought and crude feelings blossom, making us to think about something is not going right not only around into the social environment; but also the legal system of justice administration.

Camera in hand, Herzog depicts with his well knwon talent the unreasonable motifs that led these young men to murder three innocent people.

There are many highlights that will you turn back your DVD in order to capture the sinister forces that nestle behind the human mind.

A simple masterwork, one-of-its-kind.

Not to be missed.",1419724800,,987,5.4183006535947715
5038932,2,B006Z7Z3L8,"Drek. Slow moving, lingering B roll footage, interviewer asks a question and then answers it  leading the subjects by the nose to get answers he wants. Poorly made, badly edited.  Just horrible.",1414281600,,194,5.03125
5038953,2,B006Z7Z3L8,"Capital punishment is not about deterrence nor ""eye for an eye"".  Instead, it is all about the value a society places on the lives of the INNOCENT VICTIMS.  If a society fails to exact the ultimate consequence for the ultimate crime of murder, that society truly does not value INNOCENT human life unconditionally.

Understanding this, it is clear why this film is a lie, a political hack job, an opinion piece masquerading as a ""documentary"".  It pushes the pro-death agenda FOR INNOCENTS all the while advancing protections for the lives of the MURDERERS.  We see this thinking in the pro-abortion agenda and the pro-gay-marriage agenda, as well:  those who view morality as transcending convenience and see through self-serving fine-sounding arguments are vilified as ""insensitive"" and ""uncaring"".

To underscore the dishonesty of this opinion-piece:

1)  The eyewitness to these murders, Kristen Willis, was omitted from this film seemingly because it flies in the face of the filmmaker's political narrative of ""innocence of the wrongfully convicted"";

2)  Lisa Stotler, daughter of murder victim Sandra Stotler, is portrayed as being against (albeit mildly) capital punishment.  Yet, careful review of actual interviews of Lisa Stotler after she attended the execution of Michael Perry reveal the complete opposite:  she felt that his behavior and statement prior to his execution confirmed just how much a ""monster"" (her words) he still truly was--unrepentant, still pretending he was innocent, blaming everyone but himself, showing zero remorse toward his victims and their families.  She felt that ""justice was served"" by his execution.

3)  The inclusion of the interview with the former executioner, while interesting, has zero to do with the events in this film.  He story is unrelated to the people and times that this film portends to display.  The only reason this former executioner was included was to make a ""anti-capital punishment"" statement.  The filmmaker, by including a completely unrelated person in this film has, in the same act, removed his film from being a ""documentary"" and underscored that he is only interested in making a political statement at the expense of the victims in these tragic events.

To be sure, the portrayal of the prison chaplain that starts the film was touching.  But that's about it.

The more I thought about this film after viewing it, the angrier I got.  The outright lies were bad enough, but to what was worse was that in order to commit these lies and fabricate this political piece, the filmmaker had to ignore the pain of the victims' survivors (the ""sensitive-sounding interviews notwithstanding) and dismiss the value of those murdered in order to get the audience to focus solely on the lives of the perpetrators.  What is never discussed is whether the consequence should match the crime.  WHY should murderers NOT receive capital punishment?  WHY should rapists, while we are at it, only get locked up?  WHY should homicidal dictators from the past century have been executed but the perps in this film be exempt?

The filmmaker is not interested in examining the issues and truth of this triple homicide, to get the audience to actually think.  That would blow the cover off of this carefully crafted con-piece and disable the audience from suspending their disbelief.  You see, the filmmaker is not a ""journalist"" seeking ""truth"" as he portrays himself.  Rather, the filmmaker is a political hack, a 'kinder, nicer Michael Moore"".",1409788800,7,3498,5.181818181818182

This doc is about a triple murder in small town Texas. A young man with NOTHING better to do and LOTS and LOTS of time on his hands orchestrates a SENSELESS murder. I mean, SENSELESS.
Years later, you get to meet the waste of skin on death row. That is him in the cover pic. I agree that it is even useless to show his face because it just does not matter. Worth nothing, got nothing and just a waste of skin.

However, this is a true story, it really happened and it will make you want to take a shower after you watch it and you still won't feel clean.

5038961,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"If a point was to be mad about poverty & crime, it most definitely was. It was more a case for this, than against the death penalty, as some have said.

The christian boy, protesting his innocence until his execution was not believable in the least. If one paid attention, we could hear him always blaming someone else for anything discussed. When he was in an outward bound program, he actually wondered who would be responsible if he was killed by alligators. Oh please. Maybe him? He seemed to always oppose sensible authority 'just because.' When he died, he 'forgives' those who were responsible.

A psychopath was taken out of society, and unlike ALL the other surrounded by poverty, absentee parents, and crime, he was raised by supportive decent parents. Well, we are told - but we never got to meet mom. We only heard she cried at his execution.

As far as I'm concerned, the other boy got off lightly, and now gets to enjoy living at the expense of taxpayers for most of his life. His wife is pretty sad, having this man's child.

I just wonder - is it nature or nurture? For sure, this documentary cannot begin to answer that question. Maybe her child can.",1400371200,,1167,4.569377990430622

5038970,3,B006Z7Z3L8,"Well I wanted to give it four stars but I can't say I like it in good esteem because I don't feel he went at this as a documentary should be written. Unbiased in the true nature of the thing is how real answers and such are found. It would have been better to have spoken to more family members and maybe even the community as a whole, to those that were friends with those on both sides to get the full impact. This is a one sided view and is made seems to make the family of the victims look somewhat demonized for how they feel. The victims families, my heart goes out to them for their massive loss.
Fact is that a true documentary is not one sided and allows all views to be seen. If Mr. Perry would have shown the slightest compassion for the family of those left behind the outcome could have been much different. Though nothing could have undone what was done. And in a society where people are called to account for their actions, Perry and Burkett will have to pay for their crimes.
Truth is it's necessary to watch this even if you don't agree because it gives you some insight into the criminal justice system. I do feel the need to say that I'm not against the death penalty and firmly disagree with the mindset of the interviewer. When someone you care for dies in a tragic way at the hand of another is the only way someone can understand what that is like and people are entitled to feel the death penalty is justice. The family can always appeal to the court for a lesser sentence. It should not be the public that does that it should be between the victims family and judge. Any other judgement is to say we who haven't experienced this know better than people who have.
The more we know the better informed we can be. Still didn't change my stance on the issue but it did give me a better understanding of how it devastates families. I just wish these young men would have thought about that before doing this.",1397520000,,1929,4.273224043715847

5039027,3,B006Z7Z3L8,"I wish we didn't need a death penalty, and I am very sad some people are sentenced to death, but it comes down to their choices. Herzog never looked at that aspect. He never addressed the issue that the subjects in this film are were they are because of things they did and choices they made. He allows both convicted men ample time to profess their innocence, and their defenses are so weak it is obvious, but never talks about how their actions placed them were they were.

Show is very very biased and looks at capital punishment from that biased view point. Herzog even spins the comments people make and he is very often leading with his questions. He falls just short of putting words in their mouth, and spins their answers to fit his view instead of what the person being interviewed thinks and feels.

Is the death penalty a deterrent? Obviously not.

Is the death penalty the best idea? Probably not. But I feel society shouldn't have to pay to keep a monster alive fir the rest of his life. If you are so willing to throw away the life of an innocent person, why should I pay to sustain that person.

Biggest problem I had with this film was that Herzog never adds any questions about the victim's rights. He doesn't really dig into the ferocity and lack of humanity that the victims had to endure. He talks about the victims but fails to really dig into the brutality of the crimes and the loss of life of the victims as much as he does into people who oppose capital punishment.

Both of the convicted men show why a life sentence is no punishment. I never saw any remorse or regret from either one. In fact both still proclaim their innocence and challenge their involvement in the crime.

One of the lamest moments of this film is when the father of one of the killers goes on and on about his failed role as a father, and then brags that he was able to save his son through what I would call lies and fake sorrow and fake responsibility. He talks about his two sons who are both in prison. He talks about time shared and spent with them. He talk about how his pleas for mercy spared his son, but it is never mentioned that the innocents who were killed probably plead as well. Burkett's father is great at playing the role of guilty dirtbag father, but we never really know much about how many times he was in prison, what he was in for, and what crimes he committed. We also never see Burkett's prior criminal information or even look at his criminal past. Herzog just looks at the one crime, but gives no background at all. One of the people in the film claims Burkett held him at gun point, but we don't ever see his rap sheet or his convictions.

Also, I was disgusted by the fact the father says it was his fault his sin was raised in such a troubled way and that he was a bad father from behind bars. If he had remorse, and was so sorry, why did he keep going to prison instead of trying to make a change? The dad only shows his lack of sympathy for others by saving a son he hasn't done anything else for, and pleading for the life of a son he himself never felt was worth staying out of prison for. The dad acts as a scapegoat, further allowing Burkett to avoid responsibility for the crimes he CHOSE to commit.

Long story short... Both convicted men show no remorse, and take no responsibility which to me shows the need for capital punishment. I also think Burkett was more involved and that his career criminal slime bag father did nothing more than convince someone to spare a monster.

Each time one of the two young men accused of killing three people said anything like, ""I keep thinking they will see that I never had a chance, that I'm just a victim here,"" I considered what the mother and two teenage boys they killed would have said.

I've never been a proponent of capital punishment and this enforced that position, but not because I had any sympathy for the perpetrators. My heart was broken for the folks who were killed and those left behind to deal with the aftermath.",1388793600,,707,4.566929133858268

Without relating the life threatening event I went through all those years ago in Conroe and getting to the point, I will say this about the impact this documentary had on me. As a Christian and as a Texan I have a real problem with the way they use the death penalty here. Life without parole seems more in line with my beliefs I don't think the possibility of death deters anyone with the attitude displayed by the young men in this documentary. It is shocking to see some of the attitudes of the families involved on both sides of the crime. I do not feel sorry for the perpetrators of the crime,although I can see where their upbringing had a tremendous affect on what they became. I just feel sorry for the families of both sides of this horrible event.

The film is far less ideological and far more practical as it presents both sides of the argument that takes you through the thoughts and feelings of all involved in this murder case.

5039069,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"Werner Herzog doesn't really try to hide his own views in his documentaries, but he's seldom overbearing with them.  He does let the people and events illustrate his points.

In this film, I believe he's trying to illustrate the arbitrary nature of death penalty implementation, at least in Texas.  He explores a multiple murder case where it's pretty clear that two young men are the perpetrators, but it's not at all clear exactly what role each played or how responsibility for each murder ought to be apportioned. After separate trials, with separate juries, attorneys, and judges, one is sentenced to die and the other is not.  Whether the viewer supports capital punishment or not, you can't help but be troubled by how arbitrary this seems.

Herzog isn't a particularly good interviewer...his questions are too often leading or overly-dramatic...but he clearly must have a knack for making people comfortable and getting them to open up and speak freely. (It was a good choice in editing to minimize Herzog's presence and focus on the responses.)  It's riveting to hear this tragic story told from the perspective of so many of the principles, and it does indeed give you pause about how capital punishment is implemented.",1375574400,,1229,5.029556650246305

There are plenty of opportunities to relate the details of the crimes here too, during the long muted sections of police video taken of the crime scene, instead we get sappy violin music meant to convey the pathos of capitol punishment in the United States of America. After I saw -Into The Abyss- I was left wanting so I went online and found out that relevant details of the case were purposely omitted by Herzog. Take for instance material witness Kristen Willis who was Burkett's then-girlfriend, who was waiting there at the second and third crime scenes.

I think I would like to see this film re-edited with Bill Burr as the interviewer instead of Werner (""Really? you smuggled sperm out of a prison?? Are you Frickin"" serious??! You gotta have your frickin' head up your a$$!!""). Herzogs interviews had a maddeningly awkward feel to them.

Even in ""Grizzly Man"" he never said the protagonist was the ignorant idealist that he was.

""Into the Abyss"" is well made and well presented, and I was riveted at all times at the careful procedure that Herzog used to present the grisly subject. Guilt is not the question; rather the events leading up to it allow the viewer to make his own decision. The film ultimately is about the death penalty, though Herzog allows a lot of room for speculation.

It's a good film and an important one, and we need people like Mr Herzog to show us the unpleasantness of life, in his honest attempt to show life as it is (or as it might be).

Herzog had 2 fine films in 2012, the other being ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"", quite fine. I admit ""Grizzly Man"" annoyed me for its subject, but I beg anyone to say ""Encounters at the End of the World"" wasn't intriguing.

5039089,4,B006Z7Z3L8,"Into the Abyss (Werner Herzog, 2011)

Might as well get this out of the way at the very beginning. I believe the position from which Werner Herzog made this movie is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And the movie has a clear bias towards that position; in fact, the movie makes no attempt to hide that bias, and Herzog is to be, if not lauded, at least not condemned for trying to pass this off as an impartial documentary. But I'm not going to turn this review into an argument about pro- or anti-death-penalty, because the film deserves a review more impartial than it is. What separates Herzog from biased morons like Michael Moore, Robert Kenner, John Sullivan, etc. is that Herzog--as anyone who's watched more than, oh, three of his movies should be well aware--is just as concerned with how he tells a story as he is with the story he's telling. This is a very important, though sometimes subtle, distinction, but I'll tell you what: as much as I disagree with the material here, I was perfectly willing to take this ride with Herzog, just as much as I was with Grizzly Man or Cave of Forgotten Dreams or Burden of Dreams (in which Herzog is the subject, not the director) or...

Why is this? Because while Herzog is never shy about expressing his repugnance for the death penalty, and cherry-picks his interviews to make sure that everyone who's ever on-screen shares his viewpoint, the fact that he and his subjects are anti-death-penalty is rarely the main focus of any given interview. Herzog's way of interviewing people reminds me of John Edward (remember that guy? ""And that man on TV who speaks to the dead, you know that man's a phony""?); he'll read the person's body language and catch the little things that animate someone during a monologue and then grab onto that and get them to elaborate. In the very first sequence, where he's talking to the state chaplain, the guy starts talking about how playing golf  is one of the ways he centers himself, he's talking about meditation and being out in the middle of god's beauty, and he starts rattling off the things he might see during a day, the beauty of the grass, the dew, maybe a cow, and he says the word ""squirrel"" and there must be some little tremor in his voice, or a twitch of the hand off-camera or something, because Herzog's next words are ""tell me about an encounter with a squirrel."" It's just wildly off-topic, but it's crazy entertaining, and all the sudden our chaplain just lights up and he's talking about this squirrel he had an encounter with and you can't help but be riveted to the screen. It's that sort of ability to read people that made sideshow carnies small fortunes back in the day (and John Edward a much larger one last decade); if Werner Herzog wasn't making movies, he'd be a carny (a la Invincible) or a card sharp (a la The Grand; there's a reason Herzog is the most believable of the non-pros at playing a card sharp in that movie). People have tells, and Herzog uses them to get wonderful interviews, or get excellent performances out of actors (if you've never seen My Best Fiend, about Herzog's long working relationship with Klaus Kinski, you gotta), in the same way Patrik Antonius uses them to get millions of dollars out of the opponents he faces across the felt.

In other words--and this is a very long-winded way of making a point I constantly try to hammer home to people--it doesn't matter what the subject is, and it doesn't matter if you agree with the filmmaker's point of view regarding that subject, when you are in the hands of a truly excellent filmmaker--and Werner Herzog is a truly excellent filmmaker. I will admit that yes, my bias against his position collided with his bias for his position in that I did not like this as well as I did many of the Herzog films I mentioned throughout this review, all of which I would recommend without hesitation. But on the other hand, I look at this and I look at some of Herzog's early works, The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser for example, and it's easy to see how far Herzog has come as a filmmaker in the forty-ish intervening years, and it is, as it almost always is, impossible to criticize this film on any technical level. Werner Herzog cares about the making of the film. And because of that, he has made a film that is likely to compel those on both sides of the debate.

Now, this may be Herzogian, if he actually knew the truths and allowed lies to be filmed, but, given the tenor of the film, and Herzog's anti-death penalty stance, it seems more likely to just be poor fact-checking.

  Herzog narrates the film, but the cinematography and music, by Peter Zeitlinger and Mark Degli Antoni, are not up to snuff. Again, very pedestrian, and one sense that Herzog almost feels as if he needs to get a film done, no matter what, including the quality. In the end, Perry fries, and Burkett survives, but the most important point comes from the daughter and sister of two of the victims, who describes the deep sense of peace and satisfaction she got from seeing the vile Perry bite the bullet, and her disappointment that Burkett and his then girlfriend (not seen in the film but at the scene of the crime) did not also get justice meted to them.

There is little doubt about the guilt of these condemned men, nor is he trying to save the souls of those destined to be exterminated by the state. I think that Herzog is trying to save the soul of the audience, the soul of the state, and the souls of the citizenry who have convinced themselves that ending the lives of murderers will somehow result in cosmic justice or less murder in the United States of America. Herzog pursues this aim by confronting all sides of a senseless and brutal multiple homicide case with his inquiring, unflinching camera: law enforcement, perpetrators, witnesses, family of those murdered, a vacuous spiritual leader who has an unexpected moment of revelation on-camera, and, most tellingly, a former executioner. Of course, I'm not talking about the kind of executioner wearing a hood and wielding an ax. I'm talking about the man who oversees the final moments of the condemned--making sure all the straps are in place, and the poison gets into the right veins and in the right amount. Herzog isn't shilling for some empty political party, or self-serving candidate for office. He is going straight for the guts of our humanity--a humanity which is directly debased by the act of state sanctioned murder. This is a truly essential film that defies all political orthodoxies and asks its audience to confront basic issues of humanity, decency, and justice. It should be shown in every classroom, in every theatre (in IMAX even), and on prime time television at least once or twice or three or four times a week.

5039115,2,B006Z7Z3L8,"I watch everything done by Herzog as a matter of course because he is one of my favorite film directors.  This ""documentary"" floored me, however, and I need to object on the record because what he has done here is just wrong.

The closing interview in this debauched ""documentary"" is with the daughter/sister of two of the murder victims (her mother and little brother).  Herzog leads her into an ambivalent statement regarding the death penalty (DP).  He seems to proudly  say, having done that, ""See--even this surviving family member doesn't think it was worth it.""  I thought he conspicuously twisted the girl's view of the DP and her feelings about the process--further victimizing her.  In similar fashion, most of the other interviews conspicuously attempt to elicit guilt or shame about the process in furtherance of an obvious agenda.  There are some poignant discussions, but most of them are thinly-veiled attempts to discredit the DP or elicit sympathy for the perpetrators who obviously have no regard for life.  This is a film with an express objective--and that is to change your view of the DP.  I was very disappointed with Herzog's attempts to manipulate this story to further his own admitted anti-DP sentiments.  I found it particularly disturbing that he dedicated the film to the ""victims"" of crimes like this.  If that was truly his orientation, he would be very pro-DP.  If it was Herzog's child or grandchild which was killed, he would almost certainly be pro-DP.  Most of the anti-DP crusaders have never been victims of violent crime, or lost someone to some brutal monster.

In my view, this entire documentary was just a re-hashed ""In Cold Blood"" by Truman Capote, which must be getting close to 60 years old at this point.  No, an execution does not bring the victim back to life, but it sure provides some closure to the victim's family, and it reassures them that society condemns the crimes and valued the victim's life.  It really is not more complicated than that.  And, executions do provide deterrant effect, if the criminal element feels like that outcome is a real possibility (unlike in California and all 9th Circuit states).  Here, ""Perry"" denied the crime and characterized himself as the victim, and actually had the audacity to ""forgive"" the real  victims' families.  He was an obscene freak, and the planet is much better off without him.  If Herzog had shown some courage and confronted Perry with some non-patronizing questions (of which there are a thousand possibilities) the viewers would have seen the real Perry--and the value of the DP would have been immediately revealed here.  But this is all a fluff-show ego-fest for Herzog, who is apparently trying to show us how enlightened, compassionate, life-embracing and un-Nazi he is.  He essentially makes himself the star of this film.  Mr. Herzog should find his new Kinski and return to making real films rather than generating this type of do-gooder lecture film which is more reminiscent of Riefenstahl's propaganda than Herzog's typical vision-quest.  Really shameful and sad, although I'm sure the film critics at the ACLU give this a high score.

And, Herzog's willingness to indulge the woman who is pregnant with Burkett's (the other murderer) child by allowing her and Burkett to characterize their ""love story"" as romantic and beautiful was just downright wrong--and offensive. (The two boys who were murdered by Burkett will never have romance or love; they will never have children.  My interest/concern is with them only.)  It would take a psychiatrist quite a while to figure out what is going on with this woman (she's even quite attractive): Is there a yearning to be a martyr, or a subverted drive to create a grand image of vast human compassion--or perhaps just good old-fashioned denial, defiance, and rebellion against her father--who knows?  I know I don't.  We know only that it is weird to the depths of weirdness.  H.P. Lovecraft himself could not fashion a more bizarre and unnatural coupling.  Many of these lifers and death-row inmates have a following of women.  It's a common phenomenon--and one gets the impression that if their lover-felon were paroled the marriage would end almost immediately as the hideous reality of the mis-match became apparent to the delusional woman.  I thought this particular ""love story"" was nauseating.  I was appalled that Herzog even tried to cast it as relevant or meaningful.

I've long been a fan of Werner Herzog, but I wish he'd take his neurosis and apparent guilt about his affluence and success and sublimate it into another one of his stunning films (as does Woody Allen) rather than this pompous, self-righteous, political drivel. I can't believe the same genius who made ""Heart of Glass,"" ""Aguirre,"" and ""Fitzcarraldo"" made this manipulative garbage.",1350950400,6,4828,5.042875157629256

5039140,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"Into the Abyss is a captivating documentary by Werner Herzog. True, some will say that it moves too slowly; but my opinion is that only a few minutes could have been cut to tighten up the story line a bit. Others say that Herzog occasionally inserts his own beliefs as he interviews people; but I don't think it depreciates the value of the documentary. I particularly valued the broad range of interview subjects; we hear from the people who were convicted of the crime all the way to the former Death Row Captain who finally quit his job, overwhelmed, even though he could have stayed and ultimately collected a pension. The film also impresses me because of Herzog's examination of family, terrible childhoods, anguish, love and hope even in the darkest of circumstances. Indeed, Herzog doesn't leave a stone unturned, delving into social and cultural issues including what makes people kill and the matter of the death sentence itself. In addition, the cinematography reflects great forethought and the musical score enhances the film.

Michael Perry and Jason Burkett were convicted of a triple homicide that took place in Conroe, Texas back in October, 2001. Just as others have noted, Perry is going to receive the death sentence and we see him being interviewed with scarcely a week to go before he is scheduled to be executed. Jason Burkett received a life sentence after his father, who is also in prison, pleaded with the jury to not execute his son and give him life instead. Burkett is eligible for parole in 2041. When interviewed, both Perry and Burkett proclaim their innocence over and over, each blaming the other for the triple homicide--and, sadly, it was all because the two (very young men at the time) wanted to steal a Camaro. A woman just about to bake cookies was killed; and it wasn't long after that her son and his friend were also killed--all over a car.

The other interviews are equally fascinating. One heartbreaking interview comes from Delbert Burkett, Jason's father, who admits that he should have been there for Jason when Jason was growing up and that as a result of his absence Jason ""never really had a chance."" We also get some interesting footage of an interview Herzog conducts with Melyssa Thompson-Burkett who married Jason in prison and is carrying his child. Herzog probes as to how she became pregnant when they are watched by a prison guard and cannot have more physical contact beyond just holding hands; and we see how Melyssa handles that. In addition, still more interview time comes from the sister and daughter of the shooting victims; so many members of her family died tragically within six years of the shooting and she tries to be strong for her children. There's yet another poignant interview with the older brother of one of the shooting victims.

Of course there's much more to the film, including other interviews, but I don't want to spoil it for you.

Into the Abyss is an excellent documentary about a triple homicide and its impact; the interviews are quite well done. This film will leave a lasting impression on you; it's just not a film that you can easily forget. I highly recommend this documentary for people who appreciate crime documentaries with social and cultural themes.

5039142,4,B006Z7Z3L8,"Let me state upfront that I ama big fan of Werner Herzog's movies in general, but that he's really brought some very compelling documentaries in recent years, including last year's excellent ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"". When I saw the trailer of this movie, I couldn't wait to see this.

""Into the Abyss: A Tale of Death, A Tale of Life"" (2011 release; 107 min.) focuses on the 3 murders (of a mother, her stepson and his friend) committed in 2001 nearby Houston by 2 teenage boys looking to steal a fancy car. Unlike most other documentaries, we never see Herzog on screen, but instead we hear him (in his ever-distinctive voice) asking questions of the many interviewees, including the 2 now grown men in their late 20s, one of which is on death row, but also the daughter/sister of 2 of the victims, and other family members. Memorable moments include the interview of one of the murderers' father, himself in prison for many years. Last but not least is the woman who met one of the murderers as a penpal, and eventually marries him whil he remains in jail.

Several comments: (1) Herzog, a known anti-death penalty activist, tries to remain neutral but on several occasions asks leading questions on the topic, one of which badly misfiring (check out the scene with the daughter/sister). (2) Herzog surprisingly does not spend a single second in the entire movie on the trials of either of the murderers, so all we get are the personal perspectives of the interviewees. (3) I just LOVE the slow pace, snail's pace really, of this movie: Herzog is in no hurry in any of the interviews and just elicits responses to his questions. (4) As the interviews followed one another, one could not help but be struck how many of the family members and close friends of the murderers had spent time in jail for serious crimes, or were still in jail.

Bottom line, this is a compelling yet conflicting movie about the death peanlty, but definitely worth watching. I encourage you to seek this out and form your own opinion about it.",1344816000,,2023,4.676966292134831
5039143,3,B006Z7Z3L8,"Critics (and viewers) raved about Herzog's documentary about two men involved in a triple homicide, resulting in one serving life and one awaiting execution.  I have seen many films on capital punishment and thought this one fell short.  While Herzog grabs you with details of the horrific, senseless crime and the impact it had on the family of the victims, he fails to really make a connection between what in Michael Perry's (the death row inmate) background created him to be the person he was, only touching on it briefly with Perry's admission that he was starving, homeless and on drugs.  He does however go to prison and speak with Jason Burkett's (life sentence inmate) father, who admits to being a horrible parent who spent most of his son's life on drugs and incarcerated.  No one in Perry's family is involved in the documentary, and with his denial of involvement (he claims he was in the wrong place at the wrong time) and his almost childlike demeanor, you're left thinking there is far more to Perry's story then is being presented. I thought it was strange that neither men were asked the crime itself. Herzog definitely shows compassion towards the family of the victims but the whole time I was watching, I kept asking, but how did these two teenage boys get here?  The best documentary films on this subject I've seen have left me questioning my stance on capital punishment...torn between the victims and their familys and the morality and flaws of the system.  Into The Abyss left too much uncovered for me.",1344816000,4,1530,4.776515151515151
5039144,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"* Werner Herzog: ""The film is not just about capital punishment or death, victims and perpetrators and executioners. It's also about the urgency of life.""

This isn't an ""issue"" documentary, one concerned with facts and arguments. It has those things, but it is not about those things.

* ""I do not do interviews. I'm not a journalist. I have no catalogue of questions. I have discourse. And I do not know where it will lead me. A goal is to look deep into the heart of ourselves.""

Like most Herzog films, this was an ambitious undertaking, but it was ambitious for a different reason. ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"" were ambitious because of immense logistical challenges. But this film was ambitious because he was trying to look 'into the abyss' of ourselves, and especially because he was trying to look 'into the abyss' of certain cautious and unrevealing rural Texans.

* ""I was fascinated by this particular crime because of its senselessness.""

Three people were killed for seemingly no other reason than a red Camaro--a red Camaro that the perpetrators kept for not even 72 hours before being detained, and a red Camaro that has since been impounded and eventually ruined when a tree grew through the floor.

* ""While only eight hours of footage were shot to make the entire 118 minute film, the editing process was so intense that both the editor and I started smoking again.""

The smoking paid off. There are some golden moments, like the preacher talking about his transcendent moment involving squirrels on a golf course, or the former executioner talking about living out the ""dash"" on the tombstone, or the cartoonish good ole' boy telling the story of getting stabbed with a screwdriver with almost clinical nonchalance.

* ""Into the Abyss could have been the title for many of my films, by the way.""

Don't let this be the only Herzog movie you see. As far as I can tell, there are only two truly great filmmakers currently operating, only two filmmakers not just deserving but *requiring* your undivided attention: one is Errol Morris and the other is Werner Herzog.

---

P.S. - As part of the same project, Herzog did a miniseries in four hour-long episodes called ""On Death Row."" All four can be found on YouTube and all four are very much worth watching--maybe even more so than Into the Abyss. If I had to recommend just one of the four episodes, it would be the one with James Barnes-- it is one of the creepiest things you will see, that a man so calm, thoughtful, and intelligent would casually admit to doing such gruesome things. It will annihilate your cozy worldview of gruesome murderers being ""monsters.""

My favorite moment of the series, though, comes at the end of the Linda Carty episode. There is a long lecture from the prosecutor about the dangers of attempting to ""humanize"" Carty because sympathies will go to the perpetrator instead of the victim.

5039167,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"Watching Into The Abyss, I was struck by how completely different the tone was from Herzog's other recent documentary Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Where the latter is a beautiful exploration of a place most of us will never see, the former is a painful, difficult, deeply sad, and profoundly important study of the death penalty.

The film examines a triple homicide case in Texas. One young man, Michael Perry, is on death row, to be executed within days. The second, Jason Burkett, is serving out a forty year sentence. Between them, they murdered a mother, her son, and her son's friend, over a car. Herzog speaks to both men behind bars, men who are barely men. Neither takes real responsibility for their actions; both prove to be evasive. Perry particularly seems disturbing; where Burkett seems resigned to his fate, Perry, soon to die, claims to be a believing Christian but comes across more like a self absorbed narcissist. His rambling half-answers, way of turning things back onto himself, and final statement in which he comes across trying to paint himself as a victim, added up to my impression of a sociopath.

And Herzog speaks to others involved in the case: Burkett's wife, who tends to be evasive on matters all her own; Burkett's father, also serving a long stretch in prison, who blames himself for the way his son turned out and indeed comes across as honest, reflective, and bitterly ashamed of his own mistakes; family members who lost their loved ones that night- their stories are heartbreaking. And Herzog talks with professionals in the field- the investigators who handled the case, a prison chaplain, and most effectively of all, a prison guard officer whose story about overseeing executions will haunt you.

Herzog leaves it to the audience to decide things for themselves. He presents all sides, delves into the rootless, seemingly hopeless society these men came from- there are people he talks to whom you wonder might end up doing a stretch behind bars themselves in the future- and asks some difficult questions. He has admitted himself that he's not in favour of the death penalty, though he doesn't really press on the issue. Instead he explores the story through his own curiousity, offscreen for the most part, asking questions, and leaves us to our own conclusions.

This is not an easy film to take in. However, it is an important one.",1338336000,,2376,4.88833746898263

5039169,2,B006Z7Z3L8,"I recently gave in to the recommendations made by Amazon and a certain online movie viewing service, and watched Into the Abyss. It sounded interesting enough based on the overview, especially the 'Werner Herzog probes the human psyche to explore why people kill--and why a state kills' bit. Unfortunately, watching this documentary was a complete chore, and I had to view it in 5 sittings because I got so bored watching it. And I'm not trying to be mean about the event which the movie contains. It's a very tragic thing that 3 people were murdered, and I did feel bad for the family members interviewed here, as they showed genuine emotion during the interviews. But what bothered me was that Into the Abyss never goes anywhere aside from those interviews. This is the kind of thing you'd see on one of those crime shows...not in theaters.

Werner Herzog brings us into a prison where Michael Perry is being held, just a few days before his scheduled execution. Perry and another man, Jason Burkett, killed three people that got in their way of a car that they wanted. Rather than just give you the story of what happened on that night, we're shown police footage of the crime scene with blood splattered all over the place, and a body lay on the floor, covered up. Seeing this footage is powerful not only for showing you how horrible it was, but because it shows that for the victim, it was just another day. They were getting ready to make cookies when the boys barged in and did what they did. Both Perry and Burkett recall what happened during the murders, though they blame each other when it comes down to it. Go figure. Perry is pretty much on his own here, while Burkett has a wife that gets interviewed, as well as his father who's serving a very long sentence too. A few relatives of the victims are also given time to express their feelings about what happened, how they feel now and more.

Again, I feel like people might think I'm being insensitive here, but all this documentary is...is people talking about how they feel. About the murders, about waiting to be executed, about viewing executions, etc. And I wish I could word this better, but none of it really comes out as being bigger than any other interview you'd see on the news. Everyone gets a decent amount of time to talk, and yet I never felt like I got anything out of 4/5 of the interviews. Burkett's father was good to listen to since he talks about how he never wanted his son to end up like him, and how he wishes he could've been there for Jason when he was little. Even if he's a 'bad guy', being in prison himself, you have to feel his pain, especially if you're a parent. Jason's wife however, brings little to the movie and is very vague on most subjects. When she talks about how she got pregnant with Jason being in jail, you wish she'd just say it instead of beating around the bush. And when Jason was interviewed, I couldn't tell if he everything he said was a lie or not. Michael Perry had some humanity in his eyes and acted like a regular young man when he talked.

My other big problem is that there's no direction. It's literally people talking, a few breaks here and there showing basic scenery, then back to talking. No interesting questions are raised, Herzog never goes too deep with topics, and with some of Perry's final moments being right here on film, it feels like a lost opportunity to not ask him more than what's presented here. Herzog also throws in a somewhat funny, but still pointless interview with a man who has an odd story about being stabbed in the side with a screwdriver, but didn't want to go to the hospital because he needed to go to work. Talk about a lack of material. Something else Herzog does is the same stupid thing he did in Grizzly Man, where the camera slowly zoomed out as the coroner just stared at the camera until the scene ended. Only this time, it's done in the beginning with a priest. Why does he do this?! It's annoying and comes off as if Werner is really, really trying to get some kind of message across.

I'll give it 2 stars because the segments with Jason's dad and an officer who took part in over 100 executions were nice. And I'll say it again- my low rating and criticisms aren't meant to offend the people who lost loved ones. It's just that so much more could've been asked and some good questions could have been raised as far as the death penalty goes.

Herzog weaves together interviews from a cast of characters in a rural Texas community to tell a story with an ending that no one, and I mean no one, will see coming. *** SPOILER ALERT *** I give it four stars because some of the police video of the bloody murder scene could be a little disturbing for children *** END SPOILER ***. Still, a worthwhile download since this one inexplicably didn't make it to a wide national release.",1337212800,2,631,4.642857142857143
5039171,4,B006Z7Z3L8,"He has such a presence behind the camera that it seems he cares nothing for the illusion of objectivity. From his uncommon voice, swelling music, and manipulative questions, one can see the puppeteer's strings right away. I know that not every documentarian needs to be absent from the film entirely, but Herzog invaded this film in such a way that I could hardly focus on the story he was trying to tell.

For instance, in the very opening scene in a conversation with Michael Perry, the death row inmate that the film is centered around, Herzog doesn't even get two questions in before launching into a diatribe against capital punishment.

During subsequent interviews he manages to not only throw in some jokes with his subjects, but he easily gets off on tangents about tattoos and relationships. Again, I don't mind him having a light-hearted conversations once in a while, but what the hell is this doing in the final film? It adds nothing to the story.

Herzog's patented profundity pervades every scene as well. The passionate music pumps through the speakers while the viewer gets treated to an agonizing amount of crime scene footage. His camera lingers on a subject in silence for a bit too long, as if he were hoping to capture something spontaneous, but to no avail.

It isn't all bad. Especially during the final act when he gets into the protocols of administering the death penalty. It seems to be the only time he let's the material speak for itself. Which is a shame because I felt he had the makings of a great film. Unfortunately, I too often found myself thinking, ""What the hell is Herzog doing?""",1336780800,3,1619,4.7304964539007095

5039173,3,B006Z7Z3L8,"After watching a number of movies of a similar subject title I was not overly impressed with this film.
Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad film, just not as good as the hype surrounding the film and it's director.

I personally didn't find Werner Herzog's questions all that insightful or special despite what I had read prior to watching.
It apparently only took 8hrs of filming to make this 90 minute film and was rushed into theater's..........I find this easy to believe.

If you're interested in this sort of thing it is worth a watch, just don't go into it with big expectations based on the directors credentials.",1335744000,8,621,4.636363636363637
5039174,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"Of all Herzog's documentaries, this film most closely follows actual events without the director indulging himself in ""ecstatic truth""-telling.  Neither is he the flat-brained teller of the ""accountant's truth.""  The horror of both the crime and capital punishment need no poetic or operatic treatment.  This is not an anti-death penalty film as some have accused.  Herzog does state that he is opposed to capital punishment, that he respects human life, but that is as far as he goes.  He does not overly empathize with the accused.  In fact, his film is dedicated to the victims' families.",1334534400,3,591,5.104166666666667
5039175,5,B006Z7Z3L8,"Few directors are as adept at plumbing the depths of humanity as Werner Herzog. Into the Abyss finds the great German director in a contemplative mood, as he explores the issues surrounding the death penalty through the lens of a pair of killers convicted for a particularly brutal murder in Texas. Into the Abyss is a relatively straightforward film for Herzog, though, as usual, he coaxes remarkable anecdotes and personal details out of his interview subjects -- some darkly funny, some just plain heartbreaking. Regardless of your opinion on the death penalty, Into the Abyss is powerful, disquieting stuff.",1334016000,4,611,5.181818181818182

8506792,3,B006Z7Z3L8,"I am not quite sure why Mr. Herzog has such a thing about prisoners on death row, but he does.  This is the second documentary I have seen by Werner that covers this subject.  I guess that he has a thing for death.  I remember his excellent account of those who text and drive, and all the mayhem and death and destruction they cause.  But I digress.

This documentary shows the darkside of America, and particularly Texas.  There is enough white trash in this movie to fill this state.  And they do a great job of butchering the English language.

This movie limps along, a documentary about the lowest of the low, the least educated and most uninformed of the educated and informed, and you have two options: change the channel or grin and bear it.  I chose the latter.

I thought I would never see a bad Herzog film but this was one.  I cannot watch anymore films from a director who chooses to make documentaries about the worst of the worst.  However, there were a couple of scenes that made the loss of 107 minutes of my life not so bad.  One, the fact that Michael Perry saw monkeys on his canoe trip to Florida is proof that he was crazy and, two, the fact that someone is willing to forsake his/her pension because they really wish to get out of the death racket is all right by me.

Three stars.  If you have nothing better to do you may want to check this one out",1496275200,2,1374,4.271317829457364

8506796,1,B006Z7Z3L8,"Herzog appears to be a demented individual in my opinion. Possibly more so than his subjects. I couldn't stand another minute if this and bailed at about the halfway mark. Very little time is spent focusing on the victims of the crime. When the focus IS on the vicitms its treated with no empathy, sympathy, or depth. I would say herzog is a sociopath but he seems to be fully capable of joy when in the presence of a murderer. Not in a scientific or psychological way either. His joy appears to be rooted in some sick admiration and a genuine compatibility with the murderer. They smile and laugh with eachother. Herzog appears to be trying far harder to make the viewer feel sympathy for the perpetrator than he ever does with the victims. I understand being against the death penalty but just because someone may see it as too severe a punishment doesnt make the crime any less horrendous or the perpetrator any less of a monster. To me, Herzogs stance against capital punishment seems to be more about being pro murder than anti death penalty.",1473292800,,1047,4.60427807486631
