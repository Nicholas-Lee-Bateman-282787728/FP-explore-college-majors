3508380,4,B001CCIS8Q,The real idea of how difficult is to win and how difficult is to beat Tiger Woods!!,1250467200,,83,3.9411764705882355
3508381,5,B001CCIS8Q,This is one open that is worthy of watching over and over. Any golf enthusiast will love it.,1231804800,,92,4.166666666666667
3508382,4,B001CCIS8Q,"This is a well produced highlight reel covering one of the best US Opens in some time.  Between the drama of Tiger's season-ending injury and the extended playoff with a previously almost unknown character named Rocco, this has all the elements built in to be an amazing watch.  The narration and production value are good, adding some back story and other interesting bits along the way as well.

The only downside for golf purists is that this DVD truly is a glorified highlight reel.  All the rounds are included, but only a selection of players and shots are shown while the pacing is pretty quick.  As a result, those who watched the entire match may see some things missing.  Also, you lose the sense of tempo that is already somewhat accelerated in a televised game, but is even higher-speed here.

For the most part, this is still a great way to remember the 2008 US Open.  I thought it was funny, but unnecessary, that they didn't show all of Phil's shots rolling back down the hill on 13 (they showed the first two and didn't show him finishing the hole).  They've also included fly-over video of each of the holes and a short promo for the USGA Museum in NJ.  So, for the money this is a reasonably good deal.

That said, I wish the USGA or the networks would put out a full-length version.  They don't even have to do much additional production.  Just sell the broadcast version (hopefully minus the commercials).  I'd buy that.

Hope this is helpful and good luck with your purchase!",1219276800,20,1496,4.571428571428571
