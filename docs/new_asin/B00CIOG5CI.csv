8582147,5,B00CIOG5CI,"I am biased having been at these shows as Weather Reports's photographer. It was a great time, the greatest time really, and to have this document of the show is very precious. WR was one of the true inspirations of world music and this film is a helpful reminder of some of that spirit and mojo. Now 30 years later I play  hand drums and guitar and always reflect back to knowing these amazing musicians and their creative adventures.

 If you love Weather Reports music this was one of the high points. Enjoy!",1450051200,,511,4.473118279569892
8582148,1,B00CIOG5CI,"Not what you think.  It's just a bad video copy of about 1 hours worth of songs.  While pretty much anything Weather Report related is great, my huge complaint is the title ""Birdland: A Musical Documentary"".  This is NOT a documentary.  Not even remotely close to resembling anything of a documentary.  Just a bad video copy of about 6 to maybe 10 songs.  Total rip-off.  I was going to send it back but I figured I'd keep it just for the live videos. There are way better video concerts out to there to buy.  Don't waste your time with this one unless you already have the '76 Montreux Jazz Festival DVD, and the '78 Offenbach Germany DVD, and the Hamburg Germany DVD from '71, and the Cologne performance DVD from '83, the new JACO Movie DVD and his concert DVD from 1976, and Wayne Shorter concert DVDs, and the Joe Zawinul Portrait DVD, well you get the idea...ok then you can buy it.  But get everything else first.  :-)",1449360000,3,925,4.420118343195266

8582154,4,B00CIOG5CI,"(Note: this is not a ""documentary"" as the title suggests-it is simply a straight forward hour long film of a live concert. There are no interviews or any extras whatsoever. I personally feel the title of this disk is misleading in that the term has come to be associated with a narrative form which this is most definitely not.)

This is a newly released DVD of a Tokyo performance from 1984. This is the version of the band with Zawinul, Shorter joined by Omar Hakim drums, Victor Bailey bass, and Mino Cinelu percussion. They were mostly performing tracks off of Domino Theory  and Procession, which were never my favorite WR albums. However, these tunes found new life when played live-the band is tight and really energetic. After a brief spacey intro they kick into Dflat Waltz and man, it smokes. Just top notch playing all around. The following duet between Mr Z and Shorter starts out pretty abstractly, with Shorter laying down some contemplative lines on his soprano sax over some textural sounds provided by Mr Z. Eventually they segue into a typical folk/classical Zawinul anthem, using ""new"" orchestral layers that Joe seems to enjoy deploying, although not leaving much space for Shorter's ruminations. It's a long and at times unfocused jam, but definitely worth checking out. The band follows up with Where the Moon Goes, a tune off of Procession, with (a very effected) Zawinul holding down the vocal chores that the Manhattan Transfer originally handled. Again, a song that left me sort of flat on the album really grabs ahold of the listener here, exuding grace and power that far exceeds the studio track. Zawinul lays down some very cool synth lines trading with Hakim's powerful drum blasts-pretty impressive stuff.

Lastly the band goes out with a medley of WR classics (and a couple of later tunes,) something they were regularly doing on this tour. You can catch a very similar medley on the Playboy Jazz Festival performance from around that same period. While I would've preferred a complete reading of one or two classics, the medley is a real showcase for this band's prodigious talents. What really intrigues me is the great dynamics this incarnation displays-in some ways this band is more dynamic than the previous all star lineup. They really know how to bring it down to a whisper before amping it back up to full throttle.

The reason this disc didn't get 5 stars is due to the shoddy way in which this material is presented. First of all, this is not previously unreleased material as they claim: It was originally released in 1988 on laser disc. There was also an official VHS released at the time. It has been floating around in bootleg editions ever since. Now with the first DVD release ever, you'd think these guys at Jazz Door would give it the royal treatment it deserves. Sadly, they did not. The disc just starts from the top- no menu page or track selection..

But the saddest thing of all is the sound. While the cover, (which incidentally has no insert whatsoever,) claims the DVD to be in Dolby Digital, it is in fact only encoded in Dolby Prologic, the least musically acceptable audio format with surround sound. It's really too bad, because it sounds like the concert was recorded really well. The mix is superb, if a little drum/bass heavy. I really think an opportunity was lost here. I can only imagine how great this disc would've sounded in Dolby Digital, let alone DTS. An alternative PCM stereo mix would've  been a welcome addition as well. In its defense, the video looks good and the camera tends to focus on the right thing at the right time without frenetically jump cutting from one thing to another. .

So, the presentation disappoints, but the performance is excellent. These guys sound powerful, tight and majestic.  Thus with some reservations, I recommend this disc as a worthy addition to any Weather Report aficionado's library. I know I will come back to it again soon.",1375056000,34,3942,4.795287187039764
