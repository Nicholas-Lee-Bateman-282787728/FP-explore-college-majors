7955193,2,B00005UQ8L,"Werner Herzog, in his storied film career, has made many a good documentary and mockumentary. Gesualdo: Death For Five Voices (Tod Fr Fnf Stimmen), made in 1995, is not one of them. Coming from a master of cinema, like Herzog, though, that still means Gesualdo is a pretty good film, but don't expect anything of depth. Ostensibly, the film is a chronicle of the life of a 16th and 17th Century prince and musical composer named Don Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa. One might think that the sordid tale that emerges in the 60 minute, made for television documentary, was crafted just to satisfy Herzog's own dictates about `ecstatic truth.'

  The film centers around Gesualdo's murder of his first wife, one Maria D'Avalos. The legend is that Gesualdo hired goons to rub out his wife in her bed, with an aristocratic lover. The bodies were then tossed into the street where a passing necrophilic monk supposedly copulated with Maria's corpse. No, I'm not making this up, as it seems to be a fact. There are also scenes on various estates of the prince where Herzog seems to just happen upon wacky locals (although he has admitted that they were staged events designed to get at a deeper reality about Gesualdo). There is a poor bagpipe playing musician who comes every week to the castle to play music to ward off the prince's evil spirit. At another time we see a supposed attractive red haired female mental patient running through ruins (never being able to lose Herzog's camera- a tip off to the setup), who, when trapped, claims she is the reincarnation of Maria, and that she lives in heaven, which may or may not be an opera box. It just happens that this Italian `mental patient' speaks English, has a boom box with her, and is wearing a pushup bustier that enhances her massive mammary glands. She was hired by Herzog for the role, and is an Italian opera singer of some note called Milva.

  But, the worst thing about the film is the hagiographizing of Gesualdo as a musical genius, simply because several modern composers have tried to link him to their work. Yet, when one listens to the compositions played by an amateur ensemble, well, genius is not the word one feels evincing itself. The music is certainly not bad, but it is merely competent. There is none of the instant recognition of greatness one gets from listening to an Erik Satie piano etude nor the internal spark of seduction that a Vivaldi concerto for classical guitar imparts. Yes, there is a certain legitimacy to the gripe that the singers and conductor in the ensemble are not exactly top notch, but even adjusting a bit for amateurishness, the music simply will never be mistaken for something Mozart or Beethoven penned. Yet, this is exactly what Herzog intends- to build a dissonance between the mediocrity of his music and the flamboyance (mostly because of his wickedry) of the man. Why is he profiling this rather obscure (deservedly so) artist? Simple. It is what Werner Herzog must do to be Werner Herzog. In that sense, Gesualdo: Death For Five Voices reveals far more about its creator than it does about its subject. Witness the multiple breaks of the fourth wall, and the sometimes absurdly long takes of people babbling on about Gesualdo's life whilst Herzog's camera strays to a cobweb upon a window or across a once verdant valley that Gesualdo reputedly chopped down himself over the course of several months.

  What all this might have to do with revelation of something deeper is....well, nothing. If anything, this film's quirky style is its raison d'etre. One feels that, had Herzog not settled on Gesualdo as fodder. He would have made a film about the very next thing that popped into his mind. And the film's style of embellishment upon already wacky reality seems designed to make Gesualdo: Death For Five Voices a This Is Spinal Tap of classical music, or an F For Fake for music. Why? Again, because it's Werner Herzog. Unfortunately, the lack of depth is what ultimately dooms this film. Other than Herzog's interest in the composer and his luridness, there really is no reason for anyone else to be interested, unlike other great documentaries he's done. Lessons Of Darkness, My Best Fiend, Grizzly Man, and Little Dieter Needs To Fly, all had reasons for their making and/or provided a new twist on something not seen before. Gesualdo: Death For Five Voices is just a quirky little television documentary, possibly a made for hire production.

  Regardless, intent means nothing, and the end result of all the confabulations, half-assed expertise, and staged incidents is a mediocre film, possibly the worst Herzog's ever made, and certainly the worst film of his I've watched. But, again, the caveat is that Herzog is a great artist, so even his worst has moments of artistic and journalistic redemption that makes a viewer smirk, despite his better angels. The film claims that Gesualdo spent the last 16 years of his life as an increasingly insane and reclusive madman. Whether or not this is true is of no real import, but by the end of this `documentary' I was of the opinion that had Herzog shot the film as a fiction, along the line of his earlier The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser, the film would have been better for its odd flourishes. A touch of his patented `eye level realism,' a dash of `ecstatic truth,' and participants that seem to be a bit more engaged, and Herzog could have really bamboozled a fictive account of the wacky composer that his `straight' mockumentary misses. As it is, Gesualdo: Death For Five Voices is merely a curio, even if from a master. But, after a curio is in one's grip, it ends up in a corner with dust upon it. Swiffer, anyone?",1339027200,,5682,4.751521298174442
7955194,3,B00005UQ8L,"""In this castle Carlo Gesualdo spent the last 16 years of his life in total solitude, in hideous torment, torn from within, pursued by furies and demons. He was an artist of the highest rank, he had a touch of genius, anticipating an artistic movement which didn't develop until the beginning of our own century, namely expressionism. In his madrigals, his favorite art form, he expressed his innermost being, his entire spiritual world, steeped in seclusion and madness."" Thus begins director Werner Herzog's film Death for Five Voices, a 60 minute exploration of the mythology surrounding the life of Renaissance composer and Prince of Venosa Carlo Gesualdo. Herzog is known for his fascination with individuals who are driven by their own demons to the fringes of society. His film Grizzly Man, about bear expert Timothy Treadwell, follows the haunting true story of a former drug addict who secluded himself and eventually died among the grizzly bears of Alaska. Gripping stuff indeed, but the problem with a similar documentary on Gesualdo is that our subject is some four-hundred years dead. No neighbors remain to be interviewed, no family members; so Herzog must rely on musicologists reading from their notes and eccentric townspeople seemingly desperate to appear on film who wander in and out of Gesualdo's ruined castle at will. What's fascinating is how his legend has survived and metamorphosed--but how much truth remains in their stories is questionable indeed. Even the opening words tell us that Gesualdo spent his final years in total solitude; but we know he had a staff of 20, plus a consort of professional musicians, and his son, and perhaps other family members. True, he wasn't the greatest entertainer Italy has ever seen, but 'total solitude', accompanied by almost 30 people, looks pretty crowded to me.

Certainly Gesualdo's life was sordid enough for any soap opera. After being married for two years to a woman who made little effort to hide her cuckolding of her husband, he conspired with his servants to murder her and her lover. Having told his wife that he would be away hunting, he returned early and killed the couple in bed--by police accounts stabbing his wife over 20 times while saying over and over, 'She's not dead!' That nasty tale is the kernel around which other stories have grown--that he murdered his second son by having him swung to death seems to be an unprovable rumor; that Gesualdo was a masochist who had himself whipped nightly is today reported as fact, but actually comes from an account written some twenty years after his death, by someone who had no particular reason to cast Gesualdo in a positive light. Herzog reports the masochism rumor, but doesn't tell us its providence. Similarly, he shows us, in one of the most macabre scenes of the film, two bodies displayed in a Neapolitan chapel that are claimed to be the bodies of Gesualdo's wife and her lover; an unnamed Neapolitan watchman states that Gesualdo was an alchemist who experimented on human bodies and injected a serum into the veins of his wife and her lover. The bodies are extraordinarily creepy--and anyone who has roamed a few Italian churches knows that around any corner might well lurk the most bizarre and hideous relics---but these sure look like sculptures to me, and unlike any preserved bodies I've ever seen. That Gesualdo may have dabbled in alchemy is reasonable--it was the end of the Renaissance and most nobles had at least a fleeting interest in the subject--but I've read quite a lot on him and never before seen the claim that he was some kind of Italian Dr. Frankenstein. And so goes the rest of the film--Gesualdo is literally demonized by the townspeople of Gesualdo to the extent that they have a pagent in which the composer appears in red, with horns, to be vanquished by an angel. It's all much more fascinating as a study of folklore than as historical fact--at one point a buxom redhaired woman appears in Gesualdo's castle claiming to be the reincarnation of Gesualdo's wife and looking all mystical and spacey...but she's brought along her boombox to play a CD, and it becomes immediately clear that she's nothing more than a glory hound. Nonetheless, this sends Herzog off to the local mental hospital inquiring after her, and he's told that they have two people there who both believe that they are Gesualdo. The most amusing scene of the film shows a chef discussing Gesualdo's wedding menu--eel and tomato sauce are recreated while his wife incessantly repeats the words 'That devil!' in the background.

Musically Gesualdo doesn't fare much better--he's presented almost as a freak; a composer who was so far ahead of his time that it wasn't until Wagner--or the 20th Century, take your pick--that composers came to a similarly extended chromatic style. It's certainly true that Gesualdo represented the extreme of Renaissance chromaticism, but he was not so much ahead of his time as behind it. It was Monteverdi's simplicity that heralded the new age of the Baroque; it was opera that replaced the madrigal as the fashionable entertainment of the age. Gesualdo was something of an Irish Elk of a composer; a mannerist who had taken a tradition to such extremes that it could no longer survive. We're constantly told that Gesualdo was unlike any other composer--but it's simply not true; chromaticism was in the air--Orlando di Lasso's Prophetiae Sibyllarum predate Gesualdo significantly; J. S. Bach was fond of chromaticism and seemed to take a particular joy in extreme uses on occasion. So again, the real context of Gesualdo is misleadingly sensationalized. It's all something of a shame. I've always seen Gesualdo as a more pathetic figure than a demon; but this perspective apparently doesn't attract Herzog. Nonetheless, there are truly fascinating moments throughout the film--and if you aren't a Gesualdo scholar you won't know what to make of it. Ultimately it's quirky and at times intriguing, but I can't really recommend it unless context and accuracy mean little to you.",1293926400,3,6052,4.997026759167492
7955195,5,B00005UQ8L,"For those who love Werner Herzog documentaries, this is the ULTIMATE! It's a difficult to find film, made originally for TV, as was the Herzog film ""Grizzly Man"".  A rather bizarre story, illustrated with stunning photography, there is also a ""cameo"" performance by ""Milda"", a European cafe singer who's hard to forget. The whole film is fascinating to any who might enjoy Herzog...It's well worth adding to any collection.",1284681600,,423,5.130434782608695
7955196,5,B00005UQ8L,"This great little presentation by Herzog has cousins in ""Spinal Tap"" and ""F is for Fake"" in that it purports to be a documentary about an artist, but is much more about myth-making and what we choose to believe about an artistic life. That 16th century Italian master Gesualdo was Axel Rose on steroids only adds to the fun. Everything is presented at face value: everybody interviewed or ""encountered"" in the course of the film takes themselves completely seriously as they recount the most stupefying parts of the Gesualdo myth, which of course only serves to make those incredible stories that much more believable. Underpinning and underscoring it all is the weirdly unsettling, disorienting music created by one of the most original geniuses ever in Western music. Of course, there are parallels here with Herzog himself and the director makes sure you know that HE is thinking of those. In short, a fabulously entertaining, genuinely funny, informative, and beautifully made and layered film. I try to see it at least once a year.",1242777600,4,1036,4.994219653179191
7955197,5,B00005UQ8L,"This mini-documentary biography of Carlo Gesualdo has TELEVISION written all over it. It's shallow and careful, in short, but if you've already acquired a taste for Gesualdo's madrigals, you'll find it informative. The best stuff is the footage of Venosa, Gesualdo's pocket-sized principality, as it is today. The scenes of the consort of somewhat dowdy modern vocalists transfixed by their own artistry in singing Gesualdo's agonized chromatics are worth the price of the DVD.",1225584000,,477,5.45945945945946
