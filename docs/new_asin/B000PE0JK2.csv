8325592,5,B000PE0JK2,Writing this for the people that can't get it to work. My family and I ordered several copies. I came to realize that most copies of this movie on DVD are recorded over seas in what is call PAL format. Some US players may. It olay it because that is not our standard format here in the states. But most any computers will play it.,1524268800,,330,4.092307692307692
