May You Rest In Peace You Beautiful Angel....

Earlier...

October 2014

I have to admit it.  From the first time that I saw her in Can't Buy Me Love, I fell in love with Amanda Peterson.  It was the late 1980s and I was in my twenties at the time, and she was the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen.  There was just something
so radiant and completely Heavenly  about her that I was awestruck.

And as an actress she was equally spellbinding.

It's been decades since I saw this movie and first became acquainted with this tremendously talented lady, however, her acting ability and beauty remain as wonderful as they ever were.

See the following tribute which I created for Amanda during the Summer of 2014,
in part because not only is she one of the finest and most beautiful actresses in Hollywood history, but also because Amanda was conspiratorially denied her opportunity to become an A-list celebrity, which resulted in her being slowly driven out of Hollywood.

Amanda Peterson:

Given its apocalyptic theme,  The Lawless Land has a very  Madd Maxx type of feel to it, with its characters subjugated to the lives of  a third world country's citizenry.

 All that lovers Diana and  Nick  want is to be together.  However,  this society has a rigid class system, where the nobility are not allowed to marry outside of their class.

Men and women are also no longer allowed to marry under God's  law, and must instead live in an atheistic world.

The only reason that I gave this movie three stars instead of two is that it is the only time that  actress Amanda Peterson and her older sister Ann Marie appear together in a feature film.

It was the only film that Ann Marie has ever appeared in.

Amanda Peterson is one of my all time favorite actresses because of the honesty with which she plays her characters and the strength which she imbues in them.

What makes Amanda unique is that she should have become an A list star in Hollywood, yet never did, because Hollywood executives made an enormous mistake in not casting Amanda in better quality films.

I say this because she  is as talented and beautiful an actress as there has ever been.

Moreover,  if  ever there were an actress in Hollywood  who was enormously underrated and deserving of A list roles that she never received,  it's Amanda Peterson.  And she has millions of very frustrated fans who feel the same way.

Furthermore,  this movie  could have been much better with a significantly  larger budget, which would have meant a larger film crew and a number of  other amenities  that would have helped to make the movie more believable and enjoyable.

The basic plot revolves around a  love affair between Peterson's character (Diana),  who  is the daughter of  a wealthy businessman,  and  a man by the name of Nick Falco (played by actor Jsu Garcia who also plays the role of Francisco D'aconia in Atlas Shrugged Part I) who is of the lower class.

Diana falls in love with Falco yet is forbidden to marry him.

The Lawless Land is  set in a post apocalyptic world that exists shortly after World War III has ended.  And it is reminiscent of the many other types of  Madd Maxx movies which surfaced during the 1980s,  with Madd Maxx being the best of its genre.

The movie opens with Diana being asked to play the piano for her father and some of his guests,  however, she is rushed because she is attempting to  leave her home in order to elope  with  Nick.

After she plays a song on the piano  for her father,  she meets Nick,  who is waiting for her in his pickup truck just outside of her home.

However, by the time she meets him on the street  a curfew has set in,  and they cannot leave that evening, so they sleep in a guest quarters  that is located on her father's property.

The following morning  Diana and  Nick leave together in his pickup truck in order to head to a local church so that they can be married.

On the way, Diana's father's butler sees her driving with Nick as his car passes Nick's truck,  and she immediately becomes concerned that he will tell her father that she was with a man who is of the underclass.

That is exactly what the butler does, however, not in time to stop Diana and Nick from being married.

While they are in the church,  Diana's father's guards enter while she and  Nick leave through another exit.

Diana manages to escape, however,  Nick is captured and taken to a local jail.  He refuses to reveal Diana's whereabouts and  is tortured and then imprisoned.  While there he falls off a beam and is left for dead,  his body later dumped on a pile of dead bodies which were  disposed of on the grounds around the jail.

Nick eventually awakens and then  heads for his grandfather's home  with the intent of finding Diana, only to  learn  that  she was taken to a remote village for her safety.

Nick's grandfather gives him a map which will take him to Diana.

From here the  movie has a few twists as Nick navigates through some of Chile's  undeveloped regions,  before he eventually finds Diana.

Actor  Xander  Berkley puts in an interesting performance as a scavenger who roams the back roads of the Chilean countryside  with his van,  looking for any opportunity that presents itself, and ultimately helps Nick  to save Diana from the clutches of one of her father's minions - A murderous character named Roadkill.

 In the interim,  Berkley's character  finds a mute hitchhiker named Venus, played by Amanda Peterson's sister,  Ann Marie,  and she travels with him  for a time before she is kidnapped by Roadkill.

This is Ann Marie Peterson's only feature film  performance,  and you can see the family resemblance between she and Amanda.  They are two fair-haired blue eyed Scandinavian beauties who hailed from  Greeley, Colorado at the time.

*As of 2012 Amanda again makes her home in Greeley.

What Nick does not realize is that Diana's father has sent Roadkill to find Diana and to bring her back to him.

As a result of this,  Nick and Road Kill eventually meet and face off and Nick kills him,  leaving Nick and Diana free to begin their life together.

However, Diana must first confront her father, who has flown by helicopter to retrieve his daughter.

When the two meet, Diana tells her father that he must accept that Nick is now her husband.

Her father does not take this news well, and  storms off back to his helicopter, while Diana - in a scene reminiscent of that played by her Cindy Mancini character in the 1987 summer blockbuster  Can't Buy Me Love -  hops on to the back of Nick's Indian motorcycle and the two ride off together.

However, the scene in Can't Buy Me Love,  where Amanda and Patrick Dempsey ride off into the sunset together on his Snapper lawnmower, is both far more believable as well as appealing.

Jsu and Amanda never have much in the way of chemistry in this movie (in fact they spend all of 10 - 15 minutes of this movie together, and the rest of the time apart. As a result their relationship simply is not very believable.

Nothing like  the chemistry between Amanda and Patrick Dempsey in Can't Buy Me Love, which was so palpable, that many fans of this movie have often asked if Amanda and Patrick were ever romantically involved after the movie was produced.

I do find it of interest that Patrick divorced his wife and acting coach (Rocky Parker) some years after he did Can't Buy Me Love.

Parker was more than 20 years his senior at the time, and perhaps Patrick, like so many of her other co-stars, had developed a real life crush on Amanda.

As for The Lawless Land, the movie closes with  Diana and Nick looking out at the ocean from within a cavern as the credits role, and the audience wondering why given her tremendous talent, Amanda was not given better roles in Hollywood movies.

I have read that Amanda would not play the Hollywood game of acquiescing to the lecherous demands of the studio moguls, and refused to be chased around the casting couch, which is why she was never given better acting roles.

It would not surprise me in the least if this is why Amanda tired of Hollywood.

And moreover, why she eventually left Tinsel Town to start a family of her own.

This has made the movies and TV shows that Amanda has done all the more special.

Of all of them,  in this author's opinion, the best are ""Can't  Buy Me Love""  and the ""A Year In The Life"" three part mini series and its offshoot TV series.

Amanda became a teen icon in 1987 after Can't Buy Me Love became the sleeper hit of the year, and a year later she would reprise her role as Sunny Sisk in the TV series
A Year In The Life, which was a spin off from the 1986 Emmy Award winning three part mini series of the same name.

Amanda truly proved how important casting is by making the roles of Cindy Mancini (Can't Buy Me Love) and Sunshine Sisk (A Year In The Life) her own.  Never has an actress been able to imbue within the characters that she's played, her own psyche, more than Amanda Peterson.

To this day, nearly three decades after she retired from acting, many of her fans scour the Internet looking for any information that they can find on this talented lady, wondering whatever happened to her, and if she might ever act again.

To quote another of her millions of fans: ""With Amanda Peterson Excellence Is Guaranteed.""

She truly was the best at her craft.  And as one of her many fans, I can say that we certainly do miss her.

In 2012 Amanda surfaced publicly for the first time in more than a decade, and did  a photo shoot with a photographer named Ryan from KR Productions in Colorado.

Since that time Ryan has stated that Amanda is considering coming back into the public eye in 2015, and that she may well do so.  There's no way of knowing if this will really happen or not.

However, it would be nice if this  does happen, since even though it's been more than two decades since she retired from acting,  Amanda still has many fans who wish her well, and would love to hear from her after all these years.  Even if it's only another photo shoot, or perhaps even an acting role in a TV series or movie.

There was something very special about Amanda Peterson that transcended both her fine acting ability and physical beauty. That is to say that she had an inner beauty that radiated in a way that positively affected those around her, including her myriad fans.

This can been seen in all of the positive comments on message boards which have since been made about Amanda by fans of the feature films and TV series she appeared in back in the 1980s and '90s.

She may have only done a combined total of 20 of these productions during her 15 years in Hollywood, however, Amanda became unforgettable in the process; and a perpetual teen icon for her role as Cindy Mancini in the now cult classic romantic teen comedy ""Can't Buy Me Love,""  which is routinely broadcast all over the world.

I just hope that Amanda and the rest of this movie's cast are being paid some type of royalties for this movie, given how inexpensive the movie was to make ($1.8 million), and how profitable it has been for Touchstone pictures over the past 28 years. Earning more than $30 million at the box office in 1987 alone, not to mention tens of millions since that time in syndication.

This is especially true given that according to Patrick Dempsey, he and Amanda were only paid about $5000 each for doing ""Can't Buy Me Love.""

Maybe about $12,000 or so in today's dollars.

In fact Patrick, who has since become an avid auto racing fan and professional race car driver, stated in a 2012 interview on the ""Ellen"" show, that he used the entire $5000 that he'd earned from ""Can't Buy Me Love"" to purchase a 1960s' Porsche 356, which 28 years later, he still owns.

This in addition to a number of other sports cars.

One gets the definite impression from Patrick that once his role as Dr. McDreamy in Gray's Anatomy ends, Dempsey will be pursuing race car driving full time.

If so, may he do so safely.

  What About Amanda And Patrick In A Sequel To CBML?

However, wouldn't it be exciting to see Amanda and Patrick do a sequel to ""Can't Buy Me Love"" as the parents of two children who reprise Amanda and Patricks' original roles as Cindy Mancini and Ronald Miller, while Amanda and Patrick fall for each other as the result of meeting through their children?

And the movie would simply be called ""Can't Buy Me Love 2.""

However, instead of *focusing on the kids this time around, the movie would instead concentrate on the relationship between Patrick and Amanda's characters having met as a result of their kids,  and then inject a lot of the original movies' humor into their scenes together; making for an adult romantic comedy that those of  us who remember the original movie so well, would both identify with as well as  enjoy.

*Instead of making the movie entirely about Ronald renting Cindy, the principle of their school could find out about this and report it to their parents, which would give Amanda and Patricks' characters a plausible reason to meet.

Instead of taking place in high school, the movie could take place in an adult setting where Patrick and Amanda would get to know each other, using the magical chemistry that they had in ""Can't Buy Me Love.""

For example, after they meet as the result of their children's getting into trouble in school, we could have Patrick  as a ski instructor who owns his own lodge, and  Amanda's character could want to learn how to ski, and decide to pay him to teach her how to.  The movie could be filmed in Colorado (Amanda's home state), and since Patrick is already an expert skier, he'd be prepared to easily take on this role.

Patrick's character could be a divorcee and Amanda's a widow, which would leave them free to become romantically involved with each other.

The movie would be filmed during the winter time, where the scenery would really be spectacular.

And the relationship between these characters could be developed from here, while the movie remains comedic, yet, has a serious side as well, like the original movie did.

The original ""Can't Buy Me Love"" musical score from Robert Folk could be used as the basis for the movies' sound track giving it further continuity with the original movie.

And the movie could be used to eventually promote a third and final installment of the ""Can't buy Me Love"" trilogy.

Given Amanda's absence from Hollywood all these years, her fans would be absolutely thrilled to see her back on screen, and in the sequel to the movie which made her famous, but this time as an adult.",1411516800,,14699,4.552238805970149
