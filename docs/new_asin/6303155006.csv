8430027,5,6303155006,"Space Rangers is a wonderful sci-fi program about a motley crew of police stationed at Fort Hope outpost. They encounter various baddies, deal with alien politics, and usually a lesson is learned in each episode. This ""wholesomeness"" is probably why I was allowed to watch this series as a youngster!

Space Rangers takes basic ideas from the British cult classics, Star Cops and Blake's 7, both of which are sadly unavailable in American video format. I would say that Firefly (and Serenity) is a direct descendent of this show, so if you like Firefly you'd probably enjoy Space Rangers.

I think it's high time that Space Rangers is brought to Region 1 DVD!",1151366400,15,659,4.823008849557522
