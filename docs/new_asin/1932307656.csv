7801530,5,1932307656,"This part  of The Spreading Flame series is especially helpful because it is about two reformers who are not as well known as some others.  The information about John Knox in Scotland and Ulrich Zwingli in Switzerland is excellent. As in Parts 1 and 2 of this series, the narration, scenery, and informational content are top-notch.  I go on now to Part 4 of the series, which I am sure will not disappoint.",1360972800,,407,4.5479452054794525
