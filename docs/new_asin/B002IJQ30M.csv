8370977,1,B002IJQ30M,"I really have to repeat what the other 2 reviewers said about this item--it is quite possibly the worst print quality I've ever seen on a DVD released by a legitimate (?) company...  Imagine taking a 16mm print of this film, unspooling the entire length of it onto a floor covered in sawdust, then dragging it around and stomping on it for a couple of weeks.  THAT print would still look better than this one does.

Now speaking as a film-collection obsessive myself, I know that some people will take any measures to get their hands on a film they need for their collection or one they've been dying to see for a very long time, so if you really need this film for those purposes, I admit it's better to have the film on the market available for purchase than for it to sit unseen on some shelf locked in a warehouse.

But as the other reviewer said...to price this at a 19.99 list price, and get charged over ten dollars for this shoddy release, ask yourself how much is it worth paying that to know you're keeping a reprehensible company like Mya Communciations in the black?  If these poorly and cheaply done DVD releases keep selling for them, they'll keep on releasing with no effort at all to restore anything they put out.  Don't give credence to the old saying of P.T. Barnum's and be just another one of the suckers born every minute.",1365292800,2,1344,4.443089430894309
8370978,1,B002IJQ30M,"No one, I mean no one, takes advantage of the audience that keeps them in business the way MYA does. Apart from a precious few releases over the last two years, almost EVERY flick they release is sourced from the WORST possible print - it's like this was their goal, to victimize their core audience and laugh all the way to the bank. There's no point in even reviewing the film (though some do have their Eurosleaze moments, as does this one, most are horrid movies as well, promoted with covers to make them appear alluring to this audience - us poor saps) as the poor picture quality, glitches, and blemishes are non-stop and preclude any type of appreciation of the flick. We need to cease turning over our hard-earned cash to these bastards until they start respecting those who pay their bills. BOYCOTT MYA COMMUNICATIONS !!!",1283212800,4,831,4.659863945578231
8370979,1,B002IJQ30M,"""Family Scandal"" is obviously not a masterpiece but has some good moments. What doesn't work at all is the treatment that Mya gives the film: the DVD looks like a transfer from a bad (really bad!) VHS with print damages all through the film. Also the aspect ratio looks wrong. All this more or less at the same price of a Criterion DVD? You must be joking. This is the last bad Mya DVD in a row for me, after ""Lucifera"" and ""Mafia Connection"". That's why I won't buy anything from them anymore.
BEWARE!",1257033600,21,502,4.351063829787234
