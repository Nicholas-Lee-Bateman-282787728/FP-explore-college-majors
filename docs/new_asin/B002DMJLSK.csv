8365512,5,B002DMJLSK,"I ordered this on February 4th and opted for Saturday delivery becasue I was so anxious to get caught up.  Not only did my box set arrive early Saturday afternoon (in the middle of snow storm...thanks FedEx) but the quality was so clear.  I am very well pleased with this product.  I get to see Horatio, and especially Mr. Delko lol up close and personal but very clear.",1265673600,,370,4.411764705882353
8365513,5,B002DMJLSK,"Great product . . . delivery a little delay (actually a lot delayed) . . . probably because we live in Hawai'i and it was across the Christmas season.

Vendor was good, but would have appreciated a more realistic/projected delivery date.",1264550400,,237,4.780487804878049
8365514,5,B002DMJLSK,"LOVE this series!  The only complaint I have is that one of the discs in in Season 2 was scratched causing a viewing problem.  I buffed it with a micro cloth which helped.  Anyway, I highly recommend this series.",1255737600,,212,4.384615384615385
