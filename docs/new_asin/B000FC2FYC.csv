8120655,3,B000FC2FYC,"NOT Restored -- so Critics' Choice Should Be Sent to the Doghouse for Misrepresenting their DVD! I love old movies and I collect dog movies. Seeing the claim plastered on the DVD cover ""Restored"" is the only reason I purchase the Critics' Choice edition. No one can honestly state the movie is restored. About 30% of the action in Return of Rin Tin Tin was shot at night, and these scenes are nearly blacked out. Sound quality is also bad, making the dialogue often unintelligible. Sad. I thought I'd finally get a decent copy of these films.",1471132800,,542,4.597938144329897
8120656,2,B000FC2FYC,This was not what I expected.  I wanted the series that was on TV in the 50's.  My bad for not paying attention but I will still watch it.,1206576000,,138,3.7241379310344827
8120657,1,B000FC2FYC,"I found this one to be very hard to understand, the words were not clear maybe because the origanal films were so old.

8120658,3,B000FC2FYC,"Looked for and found vintage Rin Tin Tin, in two of the orignial movies, ""Fangs Of The Wild"" 1939 and ""Return Of Rin Tin Tin"" 1947. The former being a typical B&W thirties crime drama without much real drama. The later movie was shot in color, however is was so blury and washed out it didn't detract from the vintage Robert Blake acting which was almost as bad as the focus. ""RINTY"" was the best actor in this film.",1178928000,7,416,4.2784810126582276
