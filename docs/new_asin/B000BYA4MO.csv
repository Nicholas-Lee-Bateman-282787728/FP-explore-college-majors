8094050,4,B000BYA4MO,"I'm a long-time fan of British comedy and of Elaine Stritch, so it was predestined that I'd like this DVD.  This one, Series 4, is the weakest of the series IMO, thus only 4 stars (I'd give the first three series 5 stars), but if you like this kind of thing, it's well worth having.",1433721600,,282,4.127272727272727

8094052,4,B000BYA4MO,Worth it just for the episode with the encyclopedia salesman.  Even lesser episodes are well worth a look for the comic genius of Donald Sinden.  Don't miss him in Noel Coward's Present Laughter.  There he is given a much wider range of characterization.,1404950400,,254,4.8604651162790695
8094053,4,B000BYA4MO,"Commissioned by London Weekend Television (LWT) in 1975, TWO'S COMPANY starred the divine Elaine Stritch as Dorothy McNab, an American mystery novelist living and working in London, who takes on the stuffy, oh-so-teddibly British Robert (Donald Sinden) as her butler. Sparks fly when Dorothy, who is under the false belief that everyone is meant to have equal footing in this life, is ""instructed"" by Robert in the correct way (ie: HIS way) of running a household. Madly bashing away at the typewriter, Dorothy needs an organised and relaxed home life...but she never counted on tightly-wound Robert. Just WHO is the help and who is the boss?!

Wickedly scripted by Bill MacIllwraith, TWO'S COMPANY offered viewers of British comedy something a little more sophisticated and biting than the usual fare, with the humour extending from the dry wordplay between Dorothy and Robert. The show came during one of Elaine Stritch's most prolific periods of her professional career. She had chiefly relocated to London for the successful West End transfer of ""Company"", but decided to stay in the country on a full-time basis when she married English actor John Bay. Setting up housekeeping at the Savoy Hotel no less, Stritch was the darling of the London talk show circuit, starred as Aunt Polly in a miniseries of ""Pollyanna"" for the BBC, and of course remained as the acerbic Dorothy for three more series of TWO'S COMPANY.

The 4th and final series of TWO'S COMPANY includes the following episodes:

""The Club"" - Wily Dorothy schemes to get her foot in the door of an exclusive old-school Gentleman's Club, in order to win a bet with Robert...

""The Clergy"" - Dorothy spends an evening entertaining three ministers who each have their minds set on hefty donations...

""The Salesman"" - Robert and Dorothy fend off a most peculiar door-to-door encyclopedia salesman...

""The Visiting Scots"" - Bedlam erupts when Dorothy's drunken Scottish cousin arrives for a stay...

""The Silence"" - Robert chooses a vulgar green Oriental-print tile for the redesign of the kitchen, causing Dorothy to resort to drastic measures...

""The Rolls-Royce"" - When it comes to cars, it HAS to be a Rolls.  Robert uses all his cunning to make Dorothy share his viewpoint...

""The Friendly Aristocrats"" - Whilst visiting friends in the country, Dorothy decides to spare Robert the bother of having to maintain his butler duties by pretending they are married...",1277856000,,2431,5.085427135678392
8094054,4,B000BYA4MO,"I liked this dvd since it showed some of England's countryside but, it was one season too long.  The actress Mary Tyler Moore of the successful tv series,""The Mary Tyler Moore"" wisely ended her show at the height of its popularity and I feel that,""Two's Company"" should've done the same thing.  This is something that many shows do and they lose their popularity and their ratings fall.  A great show that just ran one season too long!",1271980800,,435,4.623376623376624
