8175442,5,B000JVSZU2,"Don't be turned off by the strange name. This DVD is amazing. For those who love the virtual fireplaces, aquariums, and sunsets on your TV, this is a concept that is totally unique and fresh. The cinematography is superb and just amazing. The makers really put a lot of time,care, and thought into filming this DVD. With so many beautiful  Calming and tranquil scenes, tranquil music ( which can be turned off if one prefers just the sounds of nature) and a few neat surprises along the way.  And it Loops Too. I highly recommend you try it. You'll Love it.",1390521600,,557,4.5049504950495045
