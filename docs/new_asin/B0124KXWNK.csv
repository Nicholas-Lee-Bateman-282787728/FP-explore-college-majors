8725318,3,B0124KXWNK,"Acid Bath is about as indie as you can get, for better or for worse. We have a movie here that isn't above using giant wigs to cover up the fact we have the same guy playing more than one role, yet it also gives us some gore that gives you that low-down a dirty feeling as you watch. A movie like this is something you want to praise for the effort, even if the end results are a bit rough here and there. The plot is a bit all over the place, but it keeps you interested. Im not sure it keeps you interested because it is good enough or if it just the idea of random women being killed and given an acid bath in tubs that make you want to watch it from start to finish. The back of the box name drops both Street Trash and Death Wish and Id at least make a slight comparison to Street Trash as well. It isn't as well polished, but it kicks around the same ballpark in spirit and tone at least. Death Wish might be a bit of a stretch for me, but theres plenty of gore and that is a good thing.

I know every time I review a movie like this I end up saying This isn't for everyone. Well, honest to goodness that also applies here, as it basically does for the whole Wild Eye Raw series. And while you got a movie that has some rough spots, you also have a movie that you can tell had a lot of effort put into it. It might not look like much, but it has blood and gore. It also has some cheesy flash effects (for things like gunshots), as well as some very Troma-like moments where dummies are tossed off building in the place of actors (the only safe and cheap way for indie guys to do it). While this isn't a movie that will set the world on fire, it is a movie that I still respect anyway. They honestly tried with this one. It might not be something the majority of you will love, but if you dig the slums of indie horror it is worth a look.",1451347200,2,1843,3.9146666666666667

For the general public's sake, it's not fair to make too many excuses for its shortcomings, etc., just because it's a cheapie SOV flick.  So here's me trying to write a fair review for both hardcore fans and the newcomers to z-grade horror.

Acid Bath tries to have a grindhouse feel with its computer-generated grain at parts.  Some of it kinda works, but it might've been better without it.  The plot involves a guy who sells hookers' organs to a drug lord guy, and the killer melts the bodies in the tub, thus Acid Bath.  This part of the plotline I sort of enjoyed, but wanted to enjoy more.  Some of the cheap gore effects are fun, while others, when the camera jumps around too much and shows close ups of the killer's pores and open mouth get annoying.

The super cop guy hunting down the drug cartel was the more entertaining of the plotlines.  I enjoyed the scenery chewing dialogue, fight scenes, and gore.

What doesn't work as well for Acid Bath is that there's too much going on.  It doesn't really focus on any one thing for long enough, and it all kind of blurs together.  That said, I think most hardcore fans will find plenty here to enjoy.  Those who are on the outside of the so-bad-it's-good, SOV horror bubble, will hate it.  This one is really for that special niche.  It won't pull in new fans, and it won't make the existing fanbase bow down to their knees and love it to death.

If you're familiar with Todd Sheets' films, like Zombie Bloodbath 3, there's a familiar set-up.  Indie metal is all over the soundtrack on Acid Bath.  This is fun.  What's also fun, there's plenty of nudity.  If Acid Bath was a little more focused, it could've been fantastic.  Since it doesn't, it's average plus a few decimal points on the side of good.
I like 3.2 out of 5 stars more than 4 stars.",1450742400,3,1847,4.389380530973451
