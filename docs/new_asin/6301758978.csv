8362487,3,6301758978,"MOB BOSS tries very hard to be funny, and, at times, succeeds.  A send up of the gangster/organized crime genre, it chronicals the growth of a dying mob boss's nerdy son from the day he is pulled out of military academy to  the time he becomes head of an organized crime syndicate.  How funny you  will find this depends greatly on how you view low brow humor (e.g. child  being baptised urinating on pastor and mob officials), as well as if you  are watching for the women (Morgan Fairchild, Brinke Stevens--who's a  delight), and, subsequently, the nude scenes.  I enjoyed it, and found  parts amusing (such as when Eddie Deezen drops his gun into a restroom  toilet), though it is most certainly not for all tastes.  I feel that it  would be worth a rental to most, but you'd have to decide for yourself if  you want to buy it.",961027200,2,830,4.453333333333333
