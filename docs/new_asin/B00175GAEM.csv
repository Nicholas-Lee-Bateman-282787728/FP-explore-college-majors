3167292,5,B00175GAEM,"""Whether you like it or not, learn to love it, because its the best thing going."" -- Ric Flair

That quote best describes Ring of Honor, a small independent wrestling company that puts on amazing shows. People may compare it to a modern day ECW. Granted, they do have similarities but with the internet these days, you can view what the company is all about. ECW was word of mouth but that is one small detail in a vast array of differences. I'm no expert in the company but i've watched over fifteen shows from the company and have never been disappointed. Each undercard match usually last more then ten minutes. Even there worst match is far better then anything happening in the world title scenes in both TNA and WWE. The thing I think seperates ROH from the other two companies is while TNA and WWE do have strong undercards, each company has a stale heavyweight division. ROH always had a strong heavyweight division despite most of the talent going to either TNA (Samoa Joe, AJ Styles, Daniels, Low-Ki, Austin Aries, among others) and WWE (Evan ""Matt Sydal"" Bourne, CM Punk, Seth ""Tyler Black"" and Daniel ""Bryan Danielson"" Bryan). I think the only talent that didn't make an impact, no pun intended, is Colt Cobana as Scotty Goldman. They have recently produced four dvds for the mass markets and each one has been a home run. I don't know if they sold enough copies to warrant more releases but I hope they make more in the future. On with the review.

I really can't tell you how great this dvd is but i'll be fair and admit there is a few stinker in this set.

CM Punk VS Terry Funk- I love Punk and respect what Funk has done for wrestling. However, this match never gels and the finish was poor. Something ive noticed in ROH is 9 out of 10 times, the finish is satisfying but this finish is just poor. Could have been replaced by countless others.

Kikutaro VS Samoa Joe- Mick Foley comes to Ring of Honor and spares with Joe. I don't know why they never had a match together but I digress. He introduces Kikutaro, who is dressed like Mick Foley. Kikutaro is a weird wrestlers who dresses like an overgrown child with a freaky mask. The match is poor with Joe attacking the real Foley on the outside. Another no decision.

The dvd is over three hours and besides two bad matches, this is a must have for a wrestling fan with open mind. I'll admit i'm a WWE mark and probably always will be. However, I venture out and explore other companies besides WWE. I never watched anything but WWE from 93 till 01, but now I look for action in other companies. If you like only WWE or TNA, you should still give this a try. It's like the Flair quote, ROH is the best company going on right now.",1310083200,2,2697,4.396793587174349
3167293,4,B00175GAEM,"In this Ring Of Honor release, we find more technical based bouts! Very little in the way of weapons and such but don't let that fool you, this is some of the most exciting but brutal action I've personally have seen in years! Let's get to it:

Samoa Joe vs. Kenta Kobashi - This has got to be one of the most hard-hitting, brutal bouts I've ever seen in my life and I've seen some of the best like Steamboat/Flair, Bret Hart/Owen Hart, Chris Benoit/Kurt Angle, The Rock/Chris Jericho, A.J. Styles/Christopher Daniels, Brock Lesnar/Kurt Angle, TAZ/Sabu! Even Samoa Joe/C.M. Punk and none of those bouts (as great as they were) were as stiff as this!
No words I can give can describe this one. JUST SEE IT!

AJ Styles and Matt Sydal (WWE's Evan Bourne) vs. Dragon Kid and Genki Horiguchi - In this ROH Vs. Dragon Gate bout, this was a VERY fast paced bout (the total opposite of Joe/Kobashi)! I have heard of this Dragon Kid but this was the first time I had ever seen him and he was impressive. As for Matt Sydal (Evan Bourne), if all you know is his WWE time, then you really need to see him here!

Fast paced action from beginning to end!

KENTA vs. Austin Aries - Believe it or not, Austin Aries was actually fan favorite at this time and one half of the ROH World Tag Team Championship (his partner, I think, was Roderick Strong). This was for a number 1 contender for the ROH championship and it was a sight to behold! Several false finishes until Kenta puts Austin away with a move he originated, the GTS (most known to WWE fans as the finisher of C.M. Punk). Great matchup!

Bryan Danielson (WWE's Daniel Bryan) vs. Lance Storm (ROH World Title Match) - Lance Storm proved he still had it in this title match against Bryan Danielson. And for those that only know Danielson as Daniel Bryan in WWE, you need to see this one! Nicely paced match with back and forth action seeing Storm nearly take the ROH title on many occassions before falling to Danielson's ""Cattle Mutilation"" move! Great bout!

Samoa Joe vs. Kikutaro with Mick Foley - This is more of a filler for this DVD. Nothing special as far as the match up itself as Joe pretty much squashes this guy! The real action happens afterwards as both Foley and Austin Aries pretty much jump Joe! Worth one look.

CM Punk vs. Terry Funk - Unless you are a die-hard C.M. Punk or Terry Funk fan, this one isn't that special either. This is more to push Punk and his partner at the time Colt Cabanna as major heels in ROH! Still, got to give Funk credit for still getting there to wrestle! Worth one look.

Jay and Mark Briscoe vs. Naruki Doi and Shingo (ROH World Tag Team Title Match) - Another Dragon Gate Vs. ROH match up with the ROH Tag Titles on the line! Plenty of action and false finishes until the D.G. team of Doi and Shingo scores the upset over the Briscoes! Great match!

Claudio Castagnoli vs. El Generico - This was the finals of the ""Race To The Top"" tournament as both were emerging in ROH! Interesting enough, both men were fan favorites at this time in 2007! While cleanly fought, it was still a rough match nonetheless with false finishes on both ends. Ends when Casagnoli uses a ""super"" version of his ""Ricola"" powerbomb to get the win over El Generico! Good match!

Takeshi Morishima vs. Nigel McGuinness (ROH World Title Match) - A slow but brutal contest as Morishima (who was the ROH champ at this point/kind of looks like a japanese version of the late ""Freebird"" Terry Gordy) took on McGuinness (TNA's Desmond Wolfe). In this brutal matchup, we saw hard slams, suplexes and clotheslines. In the end, it was Takeshi's clothesline that spelled the end for Nigel's title hopes!

This volume is very good and but extremely hard hitting! A good alternative for those that want a break from WWE's ""PG"" era or TNA's ""WWE-lite"" style! LOL! Anyway, good purchase!",1305849600,,3838,4.492109038737446
3167294,5,B00175GAEM,"This DVD is a must for anyone who appreciates real pro wrestling, not ""sports entertainment"". The Samoa Joe vs. Kenta Kobashi match alone is worth whatever you pay for the DVD.",1289174400,,176,4.709677419354839
3167295,4,B00175GAEM,"To be honest I bought this dvd without thinking... it looked a good buy and wasn't too expensive so, on impulse I went for it.

A couple of days later it dawned on me that it probably wouldn't work, what with me living in the UK. Luckily however, I haven't had any trouble watching it (played on both my PS3 and PC).

This dvd is never going to match the production of a WWE release. It's not filled with extra features, interviews or any of those montages which generic rock songs in the background... However, I would highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to chill out, sit back and watch some great wrestling matches.",1287273600,,629,4.413793103448276

Out of 8 about 3 would get the nod as worthy of showing ROH in the best light.  The Kenta vs Aries match is a 5 star all the way around.  Matt Sydal (Evon Bourne) vs Delirious would have fit perfectly here and the comedy Foley match could have been a bonus feature but not worthy of the disk.  Its still a buy for wrestling's core fans.  If you like John Cena stay over with the WWE's crappy DVD's.  This is for serious wrestling fans who care.",1283558400,,595,4.166666666666667
3167297,5,B00175GAEM,Better then any WWE DVD I ever saw. The wrestling in the disc is first-rate even the Samoa Joe-Kikutaro match had better wrestling then the crud they put in WWE. The best matches in the DVD were the Bryan Danielson-Lance Storm-World title match & the Samoa Joe-Kenta Kobashi match which both were the showstealer of this disc. No bad matches on this disc. The rest were also first-rate. I give this DVD a 10 out of 10.,1280102400,,418,4.441558441558442
3167298,4,B00175GAEM,"There are some great matches on this DVD, without the politics that go into the bigger wrestling promotions, but whose bright idea was it to put Mick Foley in ROH, a corporation known for wrestling and athleticism? Mick Foley is one of the most overrated wrestlers today, not to mention one of the most out-of-shape. Thank God he's no longer in ROH, and has taken his clowning antics to TNA.",1255392000,,391,4.6
3167299,5,B00175GAEM,"This is, without a doubt, the best ROH retail dvd sold.  This covers the best and brightest of ROH's stars of today and yesterday in battle with some of the best stars of the world from today and yesterday.  If you only heard about the Samoa Joe vs. Kobashi match and didn't see it, the match alone is worth the buy. Don't cheat yourself.  Get the dvd for the match, and watch the rest as they are the icing on the cake.",1231459200,,420,4.097560975609756
3167300,2,B00175GAEM,"For all the hype going on about ROH, I was psyched to get a couple DVDs Best in the World, and Bloodstained Honor.  I have to admit, I'm left wondering what all the hype was about.  I expected the production values to not be on par with the big boys, and that was fine.  But to be honest, the in ring product left me, um, well, expecting more.  First, I wanted to really love this stuff, as I feel a lot of WWE TV is pretty much unbearable these days.  TNA is hit or miss.  But I found the 2 ROH videos I purchased lacking due to:  Matches were waaaay too long.  I'm fine with a 30 minute match, if there is going to be 30 minutes of action, but all too often these matches had horribly boring lengths of time with nothing happening.  Too many pulled punches.  I don't get it:  A guy has no problem jumping off a cage and plummeting through tables and chairs onto concrete, but he can't take a stiff slap?  And the blading... OMG, do they even try and incorporate the blood into the flow of the match, or just figure, ""hey, now's a good time to bleed from the forehead seeing as how I just got hit in the knee!""
Sorry, but as much as I wanted to love this product, I didn't...",1220918400,,1176,4.065217391304348
3167301,5,B00175GAEM,"Let me begin by saying, I had never seen a Ring of Honor match prior to purchasing this DVD.
 So, a few years ago, I had heard about an upstart promotion that was garnering all sorts of attention much like the original ECW had done. Foolishly, I blew it off. I figured what more could pro-wrestling do that hadn't been done by the aforementioned albeit defunct organization? Sports-entertainment had become insultingly boring since all viable competition was bought out, chopped up, and repackaged. I stopped watching the televised tripe and stuck to watching my precious few VHS tapes.
 A year or two ago, TNA wrestling had caught my wandering eye. They showcased exciting hi-flying matches and eventually I found myself tuning in each week. They had acquired some familiar faces alongside the relatively unknown daredevils. Hoping for matches past, I waited to see dream matches come real but, to little avail. What I did discover was that these younger guys were not just flashy acrobats or glorified stuntmen. They really could work good and even great matches, especially compared to the veterans that I grew up watching. Where did these guys come from!?
 Of course, they were from the little independent promotion that I disregarded, Ring of Honor. So, I did my research and out of the available titles on Amazon, I figured this would be the best to see what ROH was all about. It would at least, be worth the asking price to see the legendary Kenta Kobashi. Plus, I wanted to witness Samoa Joe in a ROH ring since his recent work in TNA does not seem to live up to the stellar accolades he receives. So, enough schmaltz!
The DVD is everything that I hoped for. There are familiar faces to warm up to, as I would suggest watching the Funk vs. Punk match first. While the Funker's good days are far behind him, it is good to see the living legend paired with a rising star like CM Punk. Along similar lines, the second match to watch is Samoa Joe vs. Kikutaro w/ Mick Foley. It's a fun bout if only to see Mick, the comedian, do his thing.
Now that those matches are out of the way, you can really start to get a sense of what the ROH buzz is about. One cannot get more exciting matches anywhere in the U.S., as far as I'm concerned. Whether you're a fan of lucha libre, technicians, shoot style, tag teams, etc., ROH's ""Best in the World"" will provide something to have you impressed and more importantly, entertained. Oh, Samoa Joe definitely earns his praise and Kobashi does not disappoint. I recommend leaving this gem for last. You won't be disappointed.
Now, I don't think I'll completely stop watching the stuff on TV but, I will assuredly pick up a few more ROH DVDs. If you're feeling like I was then, I suggest you do the same.",1217808000,,2743,4.582484725050916

Jay and Mark Briscoe vs. Naruki Doi and Shingo (ROH World Tag Team Title Match) - Another Dragon Gate Vs. ROH match up with the ROH Tag Titles on the line! Plenty of action and false finishes until the D.G. team of Doi and Shingo scores the upset over the Briscoes! Great match!

Claudio Castagnoli vs. El Generico - This was the finals of the ""Race To The Top"" tournament as both were emerging in ROH! Interesting enough, both men were fan favorites at this time in 2007! While cleanly fought, it was still a rough match nonetheless with false finishes on both ends. Ends when Casagnoli uses a ""super"" version of his ""Ricola"" powerbomb to get the win over El Generico! Good match!

Takeshi Morishima vs. Nigel McGuinness (ROH World Title Match) - A slow but brutal contest as Morishima (who was the ROH champ at this point/kind of looks like a japanese version of the late ""Freebird"" Terry Gordy) took on McGuinness (TNA's Desmond Wolfe). In this brutal matchup, we saw hard slams, suplexes and clotheslines. In the end, it was Takeshi's clothesline that spelled the end for Nigel's title hopes!

This volume is very good and but extremely hard hitting! A good alternative for those that want a break from WWE's ""PG"" era or TNA's ""WWE-lite"" style! LOL! Anyway, good purchase!",1305849600,,3838,4.492109038737446
3401791,5,B00175GAEM,"This DVD is a must for anyone who appreciates real pro wrestling, not ""sports entertainment"". The Samoa Joe vs. Kenta Kobashi match alone is worth whatever you pay for the DVD.",1289174400,,176,4.709677419354839
3401792,4,B00175GAEM,"To be honest I bought this dvd without thinking... it looked a good buy and wasn't too expensive so, on impulse I went for it.

A couple of days later it dawned on me that it probably wouldn't work, what with me living in the UK. Luckily however, I haven't had any trouble watching it (played on both my PS3 and PC).

This dvd is never going to match the production of a WWE release. It's not filled with extra features, interviews or any of those montages which generic rock songs in the background... However, I would highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to chill out, sit back and watch some great wrestling matches.",1287273600,,629,4.413793103448276
3401793,4,B00175GAEM,"This DVD is great, it doesn't have the best examples of why ROH is the best promotion wrestling wise in America.  There are some top quality matches.  Out of 8 about 3 would get the nod as worthy of showing ROH in the best light.  The Kenta vs Aries match is a 5 star all the way around.  Matt Sydal (Evon Bourne) vs Delirious would have fit perfectly here and the comedy Foley match could have been a bonus feature but not worthy of the disk.  Its still a buy for wrestling's core fans.  If you like John Cena stay over with the WWE's crappy DVD's.  This is for serious wrestling fans who care.",1283558400,,595,4.166666666666667
3401794,5,B00175GAEM,Better then any WWE DVD I ever saw. The wrestling in the disc is first-rate even the Samoa Joe-Kikutaro match had better wrestling then the crud they put in WWE. The best matches in the DVD were the Bryan Danielson-Lance Storm-World title match & the Samoa Joe-Kenta Kobashi match which both were the showstealer of this disc. No bad matches on this disc. The rest were also first-rate. I give this DVD a 10 out of 10.,1280102400,,418,4.441558441558442
3401795,4,B00175GAEM,"There are some great matches on this DVD, without the politics that go into the bigger wrestling promotions, but whose bright idea was it to put Mick Foley in ROH, a corporation known for wrestling and athleticism? Mick Foley is one of the most overrated wrestlers today, not to mention one of the most out-of-shape. Thank God he's no longer in ROH, and has taken his clowning antics to TNA.",1255392000,,391,4.6

This covers the best and brightest of ROH's stars of today and yesterday in battle with some of the best stars of the world from today and yesterday.  If you only heard about the Samoa Joe vs. Kobashi match and didn't see it, the match alone is worth the buy. Don't cheat yourself.

3401797,2,B00175GAEM,"For all the hype going on about ROH, I was psyched to get a couple DVDs Best in the World, and Bloodstained Honor.  I have to admit, I'm left wondering what all the hype was about.  I expected the production values to not be on par with the big boys, and that was fine.  But to be honest, the in ring product left me, um, well, expecting more.  First, I wanted to really love this stuff, as I feel a lot of WWE TV is pretty much unbearable these days.  TNA is hit or miss.  But I found the 2 ROH videos I purchased lacking due to:  Matches were waaaay too long.  I'm fine with a 30 minute match, if there is going to be 30 minutes of action, but all too often these matches had horribly boring lengths of time with nothing happening.  Too many pulled punches.  I don't get it:  A guy has no problem jumping off a cage and plummeting through tables and chairs onto concrete, but he can't take a stiff slap?  And the blading... OMG, do they even try and incorporate the blood into the flow of the match, or just figure, ""hey, now's a good time to bleed from the forehead seeing as how I just got hit in the knee!""
Sorry, but as much as I wanted to love this product, I didn't...",1220918400,,1176,4.065217391304348
3401798,5,B00175GAEM,"Let me begin by saying, I had never seen a Ring of Honor match prior to purchasing this DVD.
 So, a few years ago, I had heard about an upstart promotion that was garnering all sorts of attention much like the original ECW had done. Foolishly, I blew it off. I figured what more could pro-wrestling do that hadn't been done by the aforementioned albeit defunct organization? Sports-entertainment had become insultingly boring since all viable competition was bought out, chopped up, and repackaged. I stopped watching the televised tripe and stuck to watching my precious few VHS tapes.
 A year or two ago, TNA wrestling had caught my wandering eye. They showcased exciting hi-flying matches and eventually I found myself tuning in each week. They had acquired some familiar faces alongside the relatively unknown daredevils. Hoping for matches past, I waited to see dream matches come real but, to little avail. What I did discover was that these younger guys were not just flashy acrobats or glorified stuntmen. They really could work good and even great matches, especially compared to the veterans that I grew up watching. Where did these guys come from!?
 Of course, they were from the little independent promotion that I disregarded, Ring of Honor. So, I did my research and out of the available titles on Amazon, I figured this would be the best to see what ROH was all about. It would at least, be worth the asking price to see the legendary Kenta Kobashi. Plus, I wanted to witness Samoa Joe in a ROH ring since his recent work in TNA does not seem to live up to the stellar accolades he receives. So, enough schmaltz!
The DVD is everything that I hoped for. There are familiar faces to warm up to, as I would suggest watching the Funk vs. Punk match first. While the Funker's good days are far behind him, it is good to see the living legend paired with a rising star like CM Punk. Along similar lines, the second match to watch is Samoa Joe vs. Kikutaro w/ Mick Foley. It's a fun bout if only to see Mick, the comedian, do his thing.
Now that those matches are out of the way, you can really start to get a sense of what the ROH buzz is about. One cannot get more exciting matches anywhere in the U.S., as far as I'm concerned. Whether you're a fan of lucha libre, technicians, shoot style, tag teams, etc., ROH's ""Best in the World"" will provide something to have you impressed and more importantly, entertained. Oh, Samoa Joe definitely earns his praise and Kobashi does not disappoint. I recommend leaving this gem for last. You won't be disappointed.
Now, I don't think I'll completely stop watching the stuff on TV but, I will assuredly pick up a few more ROH DVDs. If you're feeling like I was then, I suggest you do the same.",1217808000,,2743,4.582484725050916
