8028034,5,B0002HOED0,"The picture quality was blurred. The color poor. West Wing Color Studio is incompetent by comparison to the high quality production of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment of ""The Three Stooges in Color""",1229040000,,199,5.25
8028035,3,B0002HOED0,"Columbia would not be apt to put a shabby B&W version of a public domain title simply to thwart people from copying a short like

'Disorder In The Court'. The person's comment was not well thought out, and just a mntal misfire! If they were to do that, people could still simply use the restored colorized version and desaturate it to B&W, a very simple process that could be done with readily available video software-some free!",1146355200,,429,4.644736842105263
8028036,1,B0002HOED0,"If you bought this useless DVD already, then I have some bad news for ya! This only has two shorts, and all four public domain shorts are now available on a single DVD, restored, in color, and in B&W! It was released in early 2005 on 20th Century Fox, and for the same price as this joke! It's called ""Three Stooges In Color"", and is available right here at Amazon! If you're considering buying this, buy the other one instead, or I'll tear your tonsils out! Sure, three of those shorts feature Shemp, but who back then could get away with saying ""Go on, sister, or I'll knock your brains out!"" on film?!",1133481600,,604,4.353982300884955

Brideless Groom

Those are the only two comedy shorts

on the entire disc; what was the point?

Not a bad idea for a DVD release,

but come on...fill the DVD up more.

This was just a waste.",1130198400,,218,4.0
8028038,2,B0002HOED0,"Avoid this dvd at all costs. West Wing took PD quality film prints and colorized them, and it looks horrible. Plus there are only TWO shorts on the dvd. This dvd was discontinued by the company because it was SUPPOSED to be withdrawn, but they figured they'd make some money selling them in cutout bins and such. If you can hold off for a few more months, Columbia will be issuing ALL FOUR public domain shorts from the COLUMBIA prints in February, so the quality will be as great as the previous two Columbia dvds. To answer a question from another reviewer, because the shorts are public domain, West Wing had the right to colorize them and not pay for these....however once the Columbia dvd comes out, i believe the colorized good quality versions will be under copyright again while the black and white versions will still be public domain. My guess is that maybe Columbia will use the high quality print for the colorized version, and a generic regular PD print for the black and white version, so that no one can steal it and make money off of Columbia's prints.",1102809600,,1068,4.567708333333333
8028039,3,B0002HOED0,"I just bought this the other day and found it in a bargain bin. Yes, I agree that these public domain shorts have seen very wide circulation already and have been issued again for the umpteenth time, and it's also apparent that quality control is lacking a bit with the colorization process this time, but considering how cheap it is, it's really not bad. The other numerous black & white versions of these 2 and 2 other public domain shorts that are usually packaged with them are of much worse quality all around. Only proves again that you simply get what you pay for.

My only question is are these 2 shorts eventually going to make it onto an ""official"" Columbia/Tristar DVD release in both color and black & white versions, or did West Wing Studios do these on their own? I'm assuming that they would have to have permission in some form or other from Columbia, but you just never know. Low-budget releases like these have a tendency to go just as quickly as they come, because practically anyone with a DVD recorder/burner and compression & authoring software can pump these out in large amounts, make a quick buck and then fade from sight.",1095638400,,1147,4.595121951219512
8028040,5,B0002HOED0,I was very impressed when I got this DVD. As a long time Stooges fan (since age five) I enjoyed these classic shorts in black and white. But I also liked the new recolorized ones. The coloring studio did an excellent job on the recolorization. They also picked two excellent episodes for the DVD. I really liked that they had one episode with Curly and one with Shemp. That way everyone's happy. Overall a great DVD.,1093651200,,416,4.4868421052631575
8028041,1,B0002HOED0,"only 2 shorts, both of which have been on numerous cheap dvds. the print quality is fair and the colorization is a distraction. a big difference from the Columbia/Sony release of color shorts which are much higher quality.",1092960000,,222,4.868421052631579
8028042,1,B0002HOED0,"Although these films are colorized by the same studio as the Columbia DVD's, they lack the creative control and direction. The public domain prints are not completely restored (sound or picture-at best its like a videotape copy), the colorization is distracting (mostly browns and blues with the exception of the bright pink carnation Moe wears and a mint green for Curly's suit-it makes you recall the Turner color process), and the ""behind the scenes of colorizing"" is a joke (very homemade and at one point they note that the era in which Malice in the Palace was filmed was the Depression!)",1092355200,,594,4.891089108910891
