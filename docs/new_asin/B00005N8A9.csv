1630090,4,B00005N8A9,"This film is essentially a collection of 3 stories, which intersect in a violent car crash. The first story is, for the most part, excellent. It is very exciting to watch and draws real emotion with a refreshingly little amount of fluff. The second story has less power than the first, but also has its moments. The fird story sells out, IMHO. While the moment of the old man's redemption is beautifully done, the rest of the story is somewhat contrived. All the stories are influenced by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but the third story more so than the other two.  I enjoyed Tarantino's two pictures more because he sets the rules of his world at the start and sticks to them. These rules are only slightly different from those of ""normal"" life, and once you get used to the rules the characters and world become quite believable. In Amores the director sets his rules closer to the accepted reality, than did Tarantino. In the third story he goes outside his rules and as a result his world's authenticity suffers for it.  This film could have been a masterpiece but, unfortunately, there are too many rough spots.",990921600,3,1133,4.688442211055277
1630091,4,B00005N8A9,"Any of those who would dismiss this movie for its allegedly senseless violence or because they feel it's a pale imitation of Pulp Fiction simply do not understand Mexican culture.  Violence, verbal or physical, proliferates in Mexican culture; I think many of the reviewers (mostly overly sensitive gringos, I would gather) who are uncomfortable with this movie would probably be equally uncomfortable with the Mexican view of life inherited from the Spaniards--i.e., the fatalism, the grim resignation to the frequent ugliness and brutality of life, and a sort of crude vivacity.  Pienso que estas personas que no les gusta Mxico no tienen cojones.  But then again, most people want illusion not reality at the movies, which brings up the next point.
As for the Pulp Fiction charge, this movie bears about as much relation to that movie as Picasso, in his early, rough stage, does to Andy Warhol's soup cans.  In Amores Perros, the violence, and, hence, the feeling, is real; in Pulp Fiction, it's trendy posing.  We cringe at the gore and we giggle at the jokes, then we forget the whole pop culture souffl Tarantino has served up.  The people in Amores Perros are blood and guts--crude, yes, and occassionally ugly, but there's no doubt they're the real thing.  Quentin Tarantino has never delved this deeply.
I give this movie four stars instead of five because it's still at times subject to a youthful impetuousness that fits the first story beautifully but not the other two.  It's not quite great, but it's still mighty impressive.  And the middle story about the model losing her leg and enduring a romantic crisis with her lover is in the end rather tiresome--it's undeniably felt by the actors, but it seems like tawdry bourgeois angst or an episode from a melodramatic telenovela next to the urban blight and horrors of the first and third stories.",990662400,121,1860,4.916932907348243
1630092,5,B00005N8A9,"Sharp, impressive and GRITTY! No stone left unturned. Unabashedly raw and real.
Amores Perros depicts the intensity of human desires, and how impassioned we become in our pursuit of gratification: The choices ultimately made in life for better or worse. Every move the characters make is a risk, but a choice made with THEM at the helm. Their life out of control is really about their enacting choices and feeling empowered by their actions, and ultimately in control.
The film is at times gruesome, and admittedly, in tone -depressing. In fact, similarly characteristic of a Willem de Kooning work: violent, expressive, imbued w/passion. However, in scope the film is a refreshingly liberating experience, a celebration of man's free will. ""Su libre albedrio."" For that I laud ""Amores Perros."" The film in its rawness, like de Kooning, sets free our caged emotions and henceforth the human spirit.",990576000,12,898,5.157534246575342
1630093,5,B00005N8A9,"I think amores perros is the best mexican movie in last 30 years, ths movie show the violence in the biggest world city, i think this movie is not ""the mexican pulp fiction"", because this violence is real we live with this violence when we open the newspapers, so this is not an invented violence, it is real; I suggest to see the movie ""los olvidados"" (Luis Buuel) for understandt the violence in Mexico city, technical the movie is great, photographie, screenplay, actor, direction, et al, so i am say you have to see this movie",990489600,4,530,4.53125

1630095,5,B00005N8A9,"This movie had us tied to the screen for it's full length of three hours. I have never lived in Mexico, nor have I been exposed to too much real life violence. Yet I saw a picture of life and the intertwining of lives so cleverly wrought, and so emotionally strong that it only serves as an enormous showcase for the talent of the makers. Hats off. And I'm sure it was all done on a shoestring budget. Another reason why I don't see the connection with Pulp fiction. (What's the main one? Well, in this movie the violence served to paint a canvas - Pulp fiction was to me mostly ""Let's make a cult movie"" plastic).
The soundtrack was really really excellent, too.
Wonderful to be privileged to watch what talent such as exposed here can do.",989625600,6,740,4.369565217391305
1630096,5,B00005N8A9,"Amores perros is one of the greatest movies of all times in Mexican Cinema and, to be honest, of contemporary movie-making.  It can not even compare to what Hollywood has released lately.  I do agree, though, that to truly understand the reality that the movie portrays, you have to have a knowledge about Mexican urban life, slang, and culture. My highest praise for this movie!!!",989452800,2,381,4.846153846153846
1630097,4,B00005N8A9,"I do not blame this film for being what it is. It's a good film. However, I do not agree with the critics who heaped praise upon it so lavishly. It was a very, very good film, but not a five star film. There is nothing here beyond ""Pulp Fiction."" I read an interview with one of the actors saying how the violence in this movie was ""real"" as opposed to the glorified violence of ""Pulp Fiction."" Actually, I think that is completely inaccurate. I think that this film is basically a Mexican ""Pulp Fiction"" without the punch that Tarintino's movie had. Don't get me wrong, it's a good drama, and will hold your interest, but if you go in expecting something stunning or groundbreaking, I don't believe it is here. Some of the scenes were very average, as a matter of fact: the non-chalance with which the hitman treats his captive, for example. Is this supposed to be humorous? Have we not seen this same ambivalance towards violence several thousand times? Worth the price of admission but not a landmark by any means.",989193600,3,1017,4.532608695652174
1630098,5,B00005N8A9,"In the largest city of the world LOVING is not just a need but a way also to show how brutal we can be when we look for love. Looking for affection, love and understanding might become something really hard to find in a concrete jungle like Mexico City.  We human beings can turn into brave and wild dogs when we love that bad, we may lose the head and just follow our animal instincts just like the main characters no matter the social status they belong to.  The narrative is fun, great and shows at the same time a new face of Mexico's lifestyle probably hasn't seen before in a movie. If you want to see the Old Mexico's stereotypes with big moustaches, horses, tequila and a ""beautiful senorita"", don't waste your time, this is  not definetely that kind of movie.",982886400,3,768,4.394366197183099

1630122,5,B00005N8A9,"Three stories of life along the margins in Mexico City converge in this inventive thriller. Amores perros is a realist Mexican film, directed by Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu. It is the first movie in Irritu's trilogy of death, and was followed by 21 Grams and Babel. It is an anthology film, sometimes referred to as the ""Mexican Pulp Fiction"", containing three distinct stories which are connected by a car accident in Mexico City. Each of the three tales is also a reflection on the cruelty of humans toward animals and each other, showing how they may live dark or even hideous lives. It was written by Guillermo Arriaga.

In the story,Octavio is sharing an apartment with his brother, which leads to a serious problem when he falls in love with Susanna, his sister-in-law. Octavio and Susanna want to run away together, but Octavio has no money. He does, however, know a man who stages dog fights, and he volunteers his dog Cofi for the next round of fights. Cofi bravely rises to the occasion, but the dog's success in the ring leads to a violent altercation. Elsewhere, Daniel, a successful publishing magnate, leaves his family to take up with a beautiful model, Valeria. Valeria, however, soon loses a leg in an auto accident, and as Daniel tends to her needs, her tiny pet dog gets trapped under the floorboards of their apartment. And finally, El Chivo is an elderly homeless man who is trying to contact his daughter, whom he hasn't seen in years. Desperate for money, El Chivo is hired by a businessman to assassinate his partner; however, as he's following his target, he's interrupted by an auto accident, from which Octavio and his injured dog stagger in search of help.

The film was a great directorial debut from director Alexandro Gonzalez Inarritu. It was compelling and absorbing from start to finish for the screenplay presents the following:a hyper-violent movie against violence; a graphic portrayal of infidelity in the name of marriage; and a tale of murderous sibling rivalry in the name of family. Also,it shows shows a deep understanding of people as well as a truly cinematic storytelling technique and brilliantly choreographed fight and chase scenes. Aside from that,the cast performed brilliantly and excellently. In other words,this Mexican epic works at all levels.",1447977600,,2296,4.9765625

1630149,4,B00005N8A9,"Nine Things about the Movie Amores Perros [aka Loves a Bitch]  (Mexico, 2000)

1. This movie is the first of director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritus Death Trilogy. Dont take the word death literally here - there are different kinds of death.

2. It consists of three separate stories in Mexico City that intersect in one random, life-changing moment.

3. The first story is set around the dogfighting culture. A young man is obsessed with his sister-in-law, and attempts to win her away from his brother who is an abusive, small-time criminal (this story was Gael Garcia Bernals first film role, who is one of the best actors to come from Latin America in a long time).

4. The second story is about a supermodel and her secret boyfriend, who is cheating on his wife. When things go bad for the supermodels career, and her dog gets trapped under the floorboards of the apartment, the stress on the couple reaches a breaking point.

5. The third story is about a homeless man who collects stray dogs, follows people around the city, and sometimes shoots them. When he collides with people in the other two stories, he begins to question what hes doing.

6. The script is engaging and well-constructed; the choices a character makes in one of the stories cause consequences in the other stories. But none of the characters ever actually meet each other. Its like a chain of dominoes that you didn't even know was set up.

7. Dogs play a significant symbolic role in each of the stories, and serve as metaphors for the deeper themes of love, loyalty, freedom, exploitation, and violence.

8. There are a lot of graphic depictions of dogfighting and other cruelty to animals.  Irritu was heavily criticized for this, but he wanted to give an honest depiction of the underground economy in Mexico City, which includes dogfighting.

9. Amores Perros is an examination of different forms of love, and different ways that love can cause chaos in life. Its a smart, original drama that makes you care about the characters. And in the end, it makes you reflect on your choices, and how those choices may impact people youve never even met.",1403049600,3,2124,4.744565217391305

1630159,5,B00005N8A9,"This movie is spectacular, plain and simple.
First of all, let me say this. It did receive some heat because of the dog-fighting scenes, but if you watch those scenes with an objective point of view, you can tell the dogs aren't really fighting. It's just brilliant editing and use of sound effects. I'm an animal lover, I've spent years working in an animal shelter and doing volunteer work. I would not watch a movie that actually harmed animals for the sake of a film. The film was made under the supervision of the Mexican SPCA and no dogs were harmed. The ""dead"" dogs in the movie are just sedated to look dead. They are really just sleeping and covered in fake blood.
It's a bit much for some people. but rest assured, THE DOGS ARE FINE.

I can accept ALMOST anything, if well done, or provokes thought or teaches or is just plain pleasing or entertaining or amusing or presents a reason to pay attention. This one is ugly and was a waste of time. The movie consists of three stories and only the third showed me anything, and not much there. I really didn't like the other two. Lo siento.
I got the movie as a result of an opinion from a good friend and the rave reviews. Lo siento ultra vez. I know this is a very early venture for this director and he went on to do acclaimed work (I really liked Babel). It doesn't even work as an art/indy film for me.

A self-destructive relationship. And Third, El Chivo  and Maru, an ex-militia killer turned Vagrant roaming the streets with his packed of dogs, obsessed with his daughter Maru, who can not see and has left a tremendous absence in his life. El Chivo (the Goat) lives in solitude not wanting to relate to anybody but his animals

Yes there is gore, and yes its harsh on animal lovers like me but I set that aside because only one of the 3 stories is about animal cruelty, the other 2 stories are about love for an animal.

This film is very raw and Yes its not perfect production but I don't think that takes away from being a 5 star film.

I would recommend this film to everyone who can handle animal gore. Get past the first story and the rest is still good. People say the second story is slow. YES and I feel its intentional. each story I feel was shot and edited to resemble the life of the character, second story the woman is left to wait and wait helpless so the story drags on on her part.

Please don't rate lower because you are an animal lover because if you do you are not rating the movie anymore you are rating a personal belief.

I expected it to be memorable and offer something insightful since it was an oscar nod, and so many people praised it on this site.  However, I was disappointed.  Not outraged like some that wrote reviews about the violence- violence exists in the world sure enough, and this movie had plenty of it.  The reason I was disappointed was because I wanted to sympathize or empathize, or merely connect with some of the characters in this film and I couldn't do it.  The ending was just as hopeless as these people's lives.  While watching a depressing or tragic movie you need at least relatable characters, or a glimmer of hope at the end of the film that maybe at some point things will get better.  This film offered neither.  The people in this film had lives very similar to the dogs- violent, painful, and without anything better ahead of them.  I read a review that stated, ""many people don't understand Mexican fatalistic culture,""  and if that is true I would say that's excellent, because who would want to?",1282694400,2,1091,4.6947368421052635
1630175,5,B00005N8A9,"It never fails that a director's worst film is what gets him that coveted `Best Director' Oscar nomination.  Just ask David Fincher and Danny Boyle about that.  You can also ask Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.  In my opinion, `Babel' is not a bad film (it is certainly better than `Slumdog Millionaire' and `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button') but it is the weakest link in the trifecta that is Inarritu's career.  His first film, `Amores Perros', was nominated for `Best Foreign Language Film' at the Oscars, and it lost to `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.  I understand that (even if I don't wholeheartedly agree).  Regardless of the loss, the film itself is a brilliant testament to Inarritu's talent and is a sterling example of his vision.

I still consider this is best film to date.

The film is told in three interconnecting parts that tell of all facets of `love'.  No, this is not a prelude to `Crash' and all comparisons should stop being made since they insult the power of this film.

The first segment concerns Octavio, a young man living with his brother and sister-in-law.  His brother Ramiro is abusive and cruel and treats his wife, Susana, like she was nothing to him.  This leads Octavio to make advances towards Susana, which turns into a full blown affair.  In order to put away enough money to support Susana and her child, Octavio turns to fighting his dog for money.  The second segment tells of Daniel, a television producer who throws his life away (wife, kids) so that he can shack up with a supermodel named Valeria.  When Valeria is seriously injured in a car accident (yes, the car accident is the connective tissue between these three stories) their lives are turned upside down as their relationship is strained to the breaking point.  The third segment (and personally the most moving) concerns El Chivo, a homeless man who makes his living as a hitman.  He is hired to kill a certain man that turns out to be his brother.  This allows him to teach some lessons to all involved, as well as to himself (which is the most important lesson learned).

It is true that you either love Inarritu's style (the constant jumping from one plot point to another) or you hate it.  Some director's have attempted to work within this style and have failed miserably, but for me Inarritu has it down pat.  He weaves an intricate and elaborate tale here that is only exemplified by his directorial choices.  There is a lot of style here, but he never once substituted style for substance.  Instead, he balances the two beautifully.

And yes, the dogs play a pivotal role in truly understanding these characters.

I also have to commend the acting here.  Inarritu has a way with actors.  He has proven this in his other work as well.  Naomi Watts, Benicio Del Toro, Rinko Kikuchi and Adriana Barraza all have received Oscar nominations for their work in his films.  Emilio Echevarria (and arguably Gael Garcia Bernal) should also be on that list.  The work in this film (especially by those two) is outstanding.  The character of El Chivo has so much depth, and this is all thanks to the beautiful way in which Emilio weaves him together.

That phone call scene alone warranted a nomination.

Breaks my heart.

In the end I totally recommend this film.  It is a stunning character study that delves deep and delivers the goods.  It is moving and breathtaking and sincere, and the heart of this film comes at you in the most unexpected of ways, leaving you with cleansed feeling despite the obvious gritty atmosphere.",1268784000,3,3532,4.732786885245901

1630177,5,B00005N8A9,"""Amores Perros"" (Love Is a Bitch) has three stories which intersect at several points, most notably at the site of a deadly automobile crash. All three segments have dogs as a key element, and each is about hopeless love. In the first story two brothers share a dog and a wife. One brother uses their rottweiler in vicious dog fights (viewers beware), and the married brother works in and robs pharmacies on the side.
 The second story concerns a super model and her older boyfriend who has deserted his wife. Her little lap dog gets trapped under some flooring, and all hell breaks loose.
 In the third story a bearded street person with a pack of loyal dogs was a revolutionary and is currently a hired hitman. He tries to get in touch with his daughter who believes him dead.
 In this devastating movie none of the characters are particularly admirable. It's exceptionally well done and well-acted, but be prepared for a downer. Mexico City is the milieu for the action. The movie sometimes moves back and forth in time so we see events reenacted from another angle; a feature that makes the narrative more exciting.

What I loved about it is that it doesn't present human emotions in neat little packages, and yet it also is not one of those annoying films where characters do inexplicable things and you have no clue as to their inner lives.  This film dishes out human emotions and behavior in big, steamy, platters of complexity and with skill and subtlety.  The theme of the dog fighting will of course be extremely disturbing, especially for sensitive animal lovers.  The film credits contain assurances that all the animals in the film were treated humanely, but the violence is sometimes near-impossible to take, even though highly edited.  But I watched anyway, feeling that the depiction of this cruelty is a useful manifesto against dog fighting that may serve a positive purpose.  The theme of the dogs was impressively well-integrated into all the story lines of the film and not just a gimmick.  It is a hellish picture in which heaven appears, but only at a distance, yet despite all the darkness and violence, the film does have a strong redemptive quality.",1229126400,3,1124,4.88421052631579

Apart from the upset (revulsion?) I can not but feel; I don't quite know how to react to this film. Clearly there is artistic talent here; there are story lines here (well, more accurately, riffs on the hopeless despair of human relationships); there is highly professional filmmaking here. But for what end? There is just one location in this movie: Hell; there is just one color in production: black.

The director perhaps says it best: ""This movie is a two-hour scream.""

1630182,5,B00005N8A9,"Movie is set on mean, crowded and polluted streets of modern Mexico City.  The film explores the lives of 3 sets of  characters and weaves the plot among them.

""Octavio and Susana"" -  Octavio who lives with his Mother, his violent brother, his brother's sister and their infant in a small crowded 2nd story apartment building.  Octavio falls in love with Susana, his brother's wife and plots to escape with her - raising money dog-fighting with Cofi, his brother's dog.  Susana lives in fear of her husband who is violent and unpredictable.

""Daniel and Valeria"" - Daniel is middle aged, married and has 2 beautiful daughters.  He falls in love with a superstar model.  He walks away from his family and the moment the couple plan to spent their first full night together - the couple experiences a tragic accident (involving Octavio and Cofi - the fighter dog).

""El Chivo and Maru,"" - A revolutionary leaves his wife and daughter and finds that he is unable to ""change the world"" - he eventually ends up in prison.  His wife remarries and his daughter grows up without him.  He agrees with his wife that his daughter would be told that he was dead.  He enters the world out of prison and becomes a hired assassin.  He also lives to regret leaving his family and being excluded from his daughter's life.  This cold-blooded killer also finds morality and humanity when he finds and cares for Cofi (the fighter dog who is abandoned) - and then Cofi unexpectedly turns on him.

The story highlights the two faces of humans and beasts (dogs) - the passionate, caring, emotional, human side - as well as the violent, desperate and survival instincts of the dark side.  This movie is tough, hard edged, violent and tense - making this film fully engaging.  Scene set-ups and actual flashes of dog fighting, beatings and stabbings - make certain scenes brutally difficult to watch - yet keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.",1212105600,4,1927,4.701492537313433

by Book Maven, and it got a ridiculously low 0 of 4 favorables at this point, until I voted favorably for that review.  Although the film has great performances, this kind of animal depiction CANNOT be tolerated with this kind of neutrality.  I didn't see any note in the end credits about animals being treated humanely, I seriously don't believe they were.
When I was in Mexico last month I saw cats that were just skin and bones, very very hard to take.  I just don't believe animals are treated with any kind of sympathy south of the border ~ you would be heartbroken if you saw it with your own eyes.  I could never give this film a recommendation because of this fact.  Attitudes need to change...it's an absolute nightmare-scenario for animals in Mexico, and I'm not kidding, I've seen it with my own eyes.  We all know about the cockfighting in Mexico, now we see the dog-fighting.  This activity needs to be outlawed there immediately, or strongly penalized, if it hasn't been already now in 2008 (I could only hope).

1630189,4,B00005N8A9,"In this his debut film, director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu crafts a complex story in a manner that he also uses in his two subsequent films, 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2007). All three films are long, tell three separate stories that collide, unfold in a non-linear and no-chronological manner, and explore the darkest aspects of human nature. The international English title for Amores Perros is ""Love's a Bitch,"" which is unfortunate in my opinion because this rather jocular curse obscures the tragedy that stalks every character in this film. The figurative expression also misses the central role of dogs, dog-fighting, and how and why dogs come off as better than humans in Irritu's narrative. Octavio loves his sister-in-law Susanna, hates his brother, and immerses himself in the seedy world of dog-fighting. Daniel leaves his wife Julieta for the super-model Valeria, but tragedy and surreal superficiality leave them both with only ruin and regret. El Chivo is a homeless wino who appears like a ghost as a background figure throughout the film, until we learn his story of broken family relationships that center around his daughter Maru. Tragic fate and bad choices bring these stories together. One way to view this film is through the closing caption provided by Irritu himself: ""We are what we have lost.""

It was after I saw ""Motorcycle Diaries"" that I decided I should see Garcia Bernal in his first film.  ""Amores Perros"", despite it's 2 hour running time is always compelling. Bernal is fine, but it's Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo who gives the most complete, fleshed-out  character. Inarritu's usual cast of unhappy people, who never get happier, is alive and well.

Each story, separately, plays out rather well.  When the three are together, it's an outright masterpiece.  Even with its long running time, it's still captivating, and also fascinating to see inside the world of these three.

Dogs play a big part in this film.  The dog the guy has in the first story, the dog the woman has in the second, and the dogs the last one takes cares of are as linked to the tale as are their human counterparts.

This could be seen as animal violence, but it is not.  The violence is never shown, but implied.  With the way storytelling can touch our hearts, this film does it effectively.

About one third of the movie concerns dog fighting, and the scenes are very graphic. Several times, it looks as if they use dead dogs (I've never seen a dog ""play dead"" quite like that), which I find highly disturbing. I can't read Spanish, but I question whether they have any ASPCA-type guidelines in place like we do in the U.S. As a hard-core animal lover, this was very difficult to watch.

1630194,5,B00005N8A9,"I taped ""Amores Perros"" a couple of months ago and was initially reluctant to watch it because it sounded rather ""over the top"".  (I was also reluctant because of the movie's English title which I won't repeat but which made it sound like a very depressing movie).  I finally watched it last nigh and was very impressed.  My Spanish was too rusty to keep up with the dialogue but I think that the English subtitles were more profane than was the Spanish audio.  Personally, I would have translated the title as ""Dog Lovers"" which seemed to be the rather loose connection between the three stories.

What I liked about the movie was the director's focus on relationships.  Admittedly the main characters had some real problems but that also enabled us to go into some complex situations.  The initial story of the trilogy focussed on a teenager's love of his dog and his sister-in-law.  He was always skating on thin ice but it was his passion that kept him from counting the cost.  This segment was the most profane of the three although we never do get much of a break from that sort of thing.  The movie jumps a bit in time which I thought worked fairly well.  We don't understand much of anything in the opening of the movie but it makes a lot of sense later on.

The second story tells of a woman's challenge in dealing with her career-ending injury.  She's a Mexican super model whose beauty is defined by perfection.  When the perfection is lost for good (""There will be scars"") she is unable to maintain to self-esteem.  Her dog is a central element in this story  and perhaps is an allegory in that her search for her dog is her search for her self worth.

The third story centers around the movie's most unusual character in a cast full of characters.  He looks like a homeless person but we find out there's a lot more to him.  He has a following of stray dogs that are one of his focal points.  He had abandoned his past but is working on reconnecting to it.

The lives of these three group of characters come together in a major car accident and the director does a good job in moving them in and out of each other's story.

1630195,4,B00005N8A9,"Amores Perros (Alejandro Gomez Inarritu, 2001)

If nothing else, Amores Perros would be remembered as the film that made Gael Garcia Bernal a star. But there is more. Amores Perros is a movie that's pretty much full of more.

The movie centers around a car crash, when a fleeing Octavio (Bernal) runs a red light and slams into a car driven by supermodel Valeria (Goya Toledo). Once we have seen the film's driving mechanism, we are presented with three stories that surround it: Octavio's, in which he tries to get his brother's wife Susanna (Vanessa Bauche) to run away with him, and gets involved in the underground world of dogfighting in order to try and make enough money to finance his dream; Valeria's, as we see the disintegration of her life after the accident; and that of El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria), a not-so-innocent bystander who rescues Cofi, Octavio's fighting dog, from the wreck. While the three stories never intersect save in the crash itself, characters intertwine, with major characters from one piece popping up in minor parts in others.

What is most impressive about this movie, perhaps, is Inarritu's sense of restraint. He's not one to lay everything out for the viewer; ambiguity abounds in this movie. That's uncommon, and it's noteworthy. What was the last movie you remember seeing from Hollywood that made you think, that forced you to consider many possible motives for any one action any character made, and then compound that hundreds of times? The ambiguity that is the film's main strength is backed up by very good acting, excellent cinematography, a wonderful score, and, of course, fine direction. I admit to shying away from this one for a while because of the weakness of 21 Grams, but this is a much better movie in every respect. See it, if you haven't. (Be warned, however, the animal lovers among you may have a very hard time getting through portions of the first story.) ****",1185926400,2,1925,4.862804878048781
1630196,5,B00005N8A9,"Bleak and brutal, Irritu's ""Perros""--literally, ""Love's a bitch""--takes Tarantino up a notch with a story of crime, betrayal, and abuse set in the rough-and-tumble slums and posh, sanitized condos of Mexico City. Filmed in grainy light to accentuate the hard edges of the story's interconnected plots, ""Perros"" is at once jolting and unsettling, opening with a tour-de-force car chase that not only rivals ""The French Connection,"" but sets in place the tone and sense of desperation embodied in the film's other theme: the anguished nature of love.",1184716800,10,548,5.310344827586207

1630198,4,B00005N8A9,"I enjoyed watching *Amores Perros* even though it was quite long.  About almost an hour into the movie, I realized that this was a Mexican version of *11:14*  If you like 11:14, then you should like this movie.  The only difference was that you'll see stories leading up to the pivotal accident and afterwards.  The afterwards is what carries on...like forever.

This movie is three-fold or rather three-parts and all involve a dog or more (hence the movie's title).  The first part is Octavio, who is in love with his sister-in-law.  The sister-in-law is in a trapped marriage with her abusive husband.  Octavio offers his sister-in-law to escape with him elswhere.  She's worried about the lack of money.  So, Octavio bets his dog, Cofi, in dog fights.

The second story involves Daniel leaving his wife and daughters for a well-known model, Valeria.  Valeria has her own little dog, Richie, that she always totes with her.  Things changed when she's caught in the middle of the pivotal accident.  In fact, her career is on hold.  She seems to take it in good strides until Richie disappears down a hole in her new apartment.

El Chivo is a homeless man, surrounded by a pack of dogs.  El Chivo is also an assassin, if paid the right price.  Not only that but he also spies on his estranged daughter, whom she believes her father is dead.

So, like I said, good movie...just a little too long.  My favorite part is the first part involving Octavio and his sister-in-law.  I looked forward to their story.",1178928000,2,1506,4.693486590038314

1630202,4,B00005N8A9,"There are a lot of dogs in this movie. And there are some dog-fighting scenes that dog lovers may not want to see.  Be forewared, a lot of dog blood is spilled.

And why?  Does director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has some kind of obsession with dogs?  I don't know but according to something I read at IMDb there's a blurb at the beginning of the film stating that no animals were harmed in making the film.  I played the DVD back, but I couldn't find the statement.  I wonder.  They sure looked harmed, and at any rate must have been sedated for some of the scenes.  There is a short documentary called Los perros de'Amores perros (2000) that explains it all for those who are worrying about the dogs.  Personally I'm not too worried because I very much doubt that Inarritu would make a film involving so many dogs and allow them to be hurt.

Anyway, this is a violent movie with a lot of the violence happening to the dogs.  It was Inarritu's first film, or at least his first big film.  He has since made, most notably, 21 Grams (2003).  As in 21 Grams, there are three stories here, connected only by chance and the dogs.  The opening scene is a car chase in which, we later learn, the three stories collide.  There was also an accident in 21 Grams that help to hold the stories together.

Here we have (1) the story of Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is in love with his older brother's wife, Susana (Vanessa Bache); (2) the story of El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria), one-time guerilla fighter, now a hit man who dresses and behaves like a homeless person; and (3) the story of Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who leaves his wife and children for a lanky runway model, Valeria (Goya Toledo).  All three stories include dogs.  Octavio's dog Cofi becomes a big winner at the dog fights and makes money for Octavio which he gives to Susana to save so that they can run away together.  El Chivo lives with four dogs, and Valeria has a little dog Richie that somehow (I can't figure out how) gets stuck under the floor and put upon by rats after it chases a ball through a hole in the floor.

Presumably this film shows us the violence that is endemic in Mexican society, perhaps inherited from the Aztecs and the Conquistadors, who were pretty bloody in their time.  Or perhaps Inarritu knows that violence plays with the young American audiences that go to the theaters, and what he has is a nice commingling of purpose.  One thing for sure, Inarritu knows how to make a film that engages the audience with not just violence but the clash of character and aspiration.  A lot of the credit for the success of this film must go to the outstanding cast, in particular Emilio Echevarria and Gael Garcia Bernal.

Best, most original scene: when El Chivo leaves the two men tied up with the gun equal distance between them, just out of reach.

Bottom line: not for the squeamish.",1168560000,5,2866,4.475915221579961
1630203,5,B00005N8A9,"I've been a fan of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu since 2003's '21 Grams' and so when they aired `Amores Perros' on IFC a few weeks back I just had to watch it.  Following the same formula as '21 Grams' Inarritu gives us a brilliant story that interconnects the lives of three very different people with a very tragic event.

We first have Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is living with his brother Ramiro (Marco Perez) and his wife Susana (Vanessa Bauche).  Ramiro is abusive and cold and this leads to a heated affair between Octavio and Susana.  In order to make enough money for the two of them to run off together Octavio begins fighting his Rott for money.

We next have Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero), a TV producer who gives up his life with his family in order to pursue a relationship with supermodel Valeria, but a tragic car accident causes their relationship to unravel, their nerves to get frayed and their love to slowly and painfully die.

The last story in the trilogy revolves around El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria), a homeless man who makes money as a hitman.  When El Chivo is hired by a businessman to kill his partner only to find out his partner is also his brother, he has a chance to teach them both a lesson and learn something himself.

It may be the car crash that links these three stories, but it's the people within them, the lives they live and the lessons they learn that connect them on such a deeper and more meaningful level.  The acting is brilliant here, with both Bernal and Echevarria turning out award worthy work, and truth be told for a debut directorial piece Inarrito delivers a near flawless film.",1165190400,4,1632,4.580756013745704
1630204,5,B00005N8A9,"If like me, you were dazzled by this year's ""Babel"", you will likely be as curious as I was to check out the first film in director Alejandro Gonzalez Irritu's trilogy about death. Similar in narrative structure to ""Babel"", this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by a defining car accident. Written with dramatic precision by Guillermo Arriaga (who later wrote the other two films in the trilogy, ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel""), all three take place within the different social strata of Mexico City, and as the title implies (English translation: ""Love's a Bitch""), dogs are intriguingly pivotal to each story. Also like ""Babel"", the various interconnections among the stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant in a gradually revelatory manner. Even though the movie runs an epic length of 153 minutes, it consistently holds your attention.

The first plotline, ""Octavio and Susana"", is about a love triangle that occurs between young Octavio, his abusive older brother Ramiro and Ramiro's wife Susana. Dog fighting is common sport in their downscale neighborhood, and the brothers own a rottweiler that's a natural aggressor in the fight pit. Octavio sees the dog as his meal ticket to steal Susana away from Ramiro and escape to Juarez. The second story, ""Daniel and Valeria"", focuses on Daniel, a married, guilt-ridden TV producer who buys a fancy new condo for him to live with his tempestuous supermodel girlfriend Valeria. Their relationship unravels in light of the car accident, and further complications occur when her little dog is trapped underneath the floorboards. The third story, ""El Chivo and Maru"", is about former political revolutionary El Chivo who has years ago left his family and became a hit man for hire. Living in squalor with a herd of homeless dogs, he is recruited by a businessman to kill his partner, both of whom turns out to be brothers. The integration of these stories is handled with supple dexterity in a non-linear fashion that allows the viewer to peel off the layers of the characters in order to understand their common dilemmas.

Unbelievably, this powderkeg of a film represents Irritu's feature film debut as a director, and his confidence and audacity are felt throughout although the third episode seems too deliberate a pastiche of ""Pulp Fiction"". He has assembled a superb cast with Emilio Echevarra the standout as the grizzled El Chivo, a scarifying vagrant who reveals himself to be a troubled soul who is the only one who successfully escapes his trying existence. In his first major role, Gael Garca Bernal portrays Octavio with escalating emotional fervor; and as Susana and Ramiro, Vanessa Bauche and Marco Prez provide powerful support. Together, they generate a palpable sense of imminent violence throughout their episode. Goya Toledo makes a vivid impression as Valeria, fully capturing her spoiled character's misplaced sense of entitlement, while Alvaro Guerrero affectingly humanizes the put-upon Daniel's increasing regret. Just as he would prove later with ""The Motorcycle Diaries"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Babel"", Rodrigo Prieto showcases superbly evocative cinematography that is in keeping with the emotional shadings of the story.

The 2001 DVD provides a surprising number of extras beginning with an informative, often meticulous commentary track by Irritu and Arriaga (spoken in Spanish and subtitled in English). There are three quick featurettes. The first is a six-minute short that shows how the numerous dogs used in the film were trained and protected during the production. Considering how realistically violent the dog fighting scenes are, I find this short helpfully reassuring. The second is the standard, making-of featurette, about fifteen minutes long. Even though Irritu seems to be promoting the film as well as explaining the genesis of it, there is good behind-the-scenes footage, including some interesting table readings from the cast. This leads to one quick short about the staging of the car accident itself. Also included are about a dozen deleted scenes, totaling about fifteen minutes, which actually help provide context in understanding some of the characters' motivations. There are also three music videos from the movie's soundtrack, which is a dramatically effective mix of Mexican and Spanish rock-rap tracks.",1164412800,3,4386,5.326118326118326

You feel like a voyeur on other people's miserable lives and you never get inside their heads enough to really care. Its like watching a sit com, just splashed all over a big screen. There is too much violence without a point. The acting is good but the stories are blah, especially the middle one, and the themes are not developed very well.

1630210,2,B00005N8A9,"I'm not a PETA extremist (far from it), but one of the most difficult things for me in watching this film was the horrific violence gratuitously unleashed on the many dogs used in this movie.  It simply ruined the film for me.  The relationships of many of the main characters involved the dogs in their lives -- most of whom meet graphically bloody ends. All the blood-and-guts violence involving humans was created with special effects (pretty-boy star Gael Garcia didn't suffer one bit).  But how many REAL bleeding and dying / dead dogs did they use / torture / maim / kill to make this movie?  I lost count.  There were no special effects for the dogs -- to paraphrase Monty Python, ""I know a dead dog when I see it,"" and the filmakers killed and maimed plenty for real.

Yeah, it may be a fairly-captivating story line, involving multiple characters from different social strata in Mexico City whose separate lives become intertwined over a horrific car crash.  But I couldn't shake my deepening dismay over inflicting such real violence and suffering just to make a g*d**n movie.  How seriously can one take the filmakers' ""exploration of passion, loss, and the fragility of life,"" when they are so callous and cruel in making it?  This whole crew led by Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu really made me angry by ironically exploiting life's ""fragility,"" and that ruined the effect of what might otherwise be an engrossing, well-crafted film.

Net: It's impactful, all right, but if you're at all sympathetic to the suffering of other living beings, skip this film.  If you want an alternative to the typically thin Hollywood story line with a happy and definitive ending, but can stomach graphic violence and real blood and suffering, read some other reviews as the film has many other positive aspects.

1630211,5,B00005N8A9,"It's that simple. I was completely blown away the first time I watched this dazzling film, and the second time around, it was even better. This is a modern classic, no less. Those who have seen it will never forget it. There is no other like it.

This film really screwed me up, mentally. So multi-dimensional, so profound. so sad and brilliant and full of life. So real. So. So. Real. You don't know what to feel once this movie is finished. Is it sad? Truly, it is. Is it violent? Most certainly. Is it vicious? For sure. Is it life-affirming? In subtle ways, yes. In 2 and a half hours, this movie enlightens on the human spirit unlike countless lectures that have failed to do so. When a film can enlighten you on your own existence and shake your perceptions, that is when you know for sure that true art has been conceived.

Three different plotlines are connected by a fatal car crash:

Octavio and Susanna: Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) is a poor young man living with his mother, his violent criminal brother Ramiro, and his brother's young wife Susanna and their baby. Octavio falls for Susanna, and in order to convince her to run away with him, enrolls Ramiro's rotweiller pooch into the bloody underworld of dogfighting. Money comes in fast, and Susanna agrees to run away with Octavio.
I will leave it at that, adding simply that Octavio's plan blows up in his face.

Valeria and Daniel: Valeria is an up and coming model who has just moved in with her boyfriend Daniel. Daniel has left his wife and daughters for Valeria, and the two have just purchased their new home. Everything seems to be a dream at first, until Valeria becomes a victim of the story's fatal car crash. Along with her deteriorating health, Valeria's beloved little dog falls into a crack in the floorboards, which  propels the relationship of Daniel and Valeria over the edge.

El Chivo: El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) is an old bum/part-time hitman. He roams the streets with his beloved pack of dogs, his only true friends. The love he feels for them is overwhelming. It is soon revealed that El Chivo is a former guerilla who abandoned an admirable career, a wife, and a baby daughter to serve his cause. El Chivo ended up serving 20 years in prison, and he and his wife agreed that their daughter would be raised to assume that her father was dead. But memories come back to haunt El Chivo, and he strives to seek whatever small redemption he can acquire over the course of his story.

Every little thing about this movie is perfect, sublime, incredibly moving. The acting isn't acting. All the actors become the people to the extent that you feel as though these characters are your neighbors, your friends, people you know. Emilio Ecvevarria delivers a performance on par with the likes of Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson. This actor should be a modern legend. But alas, in Hollywood, there is no place for him. Well, screw Hollywood, because I don't remember the last time that I saw Hollywood deliver a film on par, or even CLOSE to the heights of Amores Perros. The definition of a great actor is someone whose presence alone is captivating enough to take over the screen. Echevarria fits into this category by miles and miles. His performance is astounding, and his character will wrench you and haunt you for the rest of your days.

The stories and the themes, that love, in one way or another destroys, that humans and dogs share multiple parallels are all presented with vicious eloquence, if such a thing is possible, and I believe it is. The music sets the hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. Every shot serves a purpose, and the camera moves with the fierce passion of its characters.

1630218,5,B00005N8A9,"During many times the spirit of ""the wonderful real"" (a coined term by Alejo Carpentier) nestled in the mind of Latin American artists. If I hat to remind the first reference in this sense I would name Cortazar  Rayuela , a famous novel in which the narrative is fractured and according author 's wishes, expanded or reduced, and imagining a entangled labyrinth of new derived situations acquires importance for then vanishing or eventually to become in the real importance thread of the story. Miguel Otero Silva a famous Venezuelan writer wrote ""When I want to weep, I don' t""  where we find in the same beginning of the play three families who coincide in a cemetery. Each one of them cries the death of his victim  ""curiously"" named Victorino, born and dead the same day. One of them is high class, the other media class and the last one of humble extraction.

The high peak in the Literature was reached by Gabriel Garca Mrquez, (Literature Nobel Prize 1984) with his famous ""Cien aos de soledad"" , the most acclaimed Latin American novel of the sixties.

In this state of things you could say there was a true eruptive state in many filmmakers but that by different reasons never crystallized until the conjunction of such talents to produce the materialization of a long expected wish. Regarded with objective serenity, Mexico has been land of brilliant writers and poets Octavio, Paz, Carlos Fuentes and the great Alfonso Reyes, that' s why there is nothing surprising to know this film was filmed in that location.

Three different social levels immersed in their own business will meet in a brutal crash, and from this horrid encounter the film will turn through wonderful flash backs to tell every little story with their triumphs and defeats, with their vices and virtues. The dogs are the common denominator in each one of these portraits.

A diminished marriage where the sum of disaffections overpass the ancient love promises, the minor tragedies of the low depths, reminding us unavoidable to Luis Buuel ' Los Olvidados"" every one of them have a serious ethical deficit of minor or major intensity. And the ancient concept of the Greek tragedy spies on with new dresses to revitalize a concept so many times lived and so many times forgotten, due the well know concept: the vanity of the post modernism.

But the fate' s hand will appear to change the life and times of those human beings. Special attention deserves the most complex dramatic nude; two brothers who hate one each other, metaphorically expressed as the evilness of the contraries. One of them will hire a mercenary to murder his brother, and this human being has an important card to play. He does not  t follow necessarily the dictated instructions and will become an unexpected focus of tension, due his unpredictability.

Irony, tragedy, magic realism, poetic violence, wonderful narrative ellipsis, exceptional camera work, amusing script, solid dialogues, mythic punishment and a great doses of this artistic current (Lo real maravilloso) conform a extraordinary mosaic inside this fundamental masterpiece of the Latin American Cinema and one of the best Mexican movies ever made.",1127260800,8,3168,4.9716446124763705

This movie is excellent, although you have got to see it with a very open-mind. It displays much more gore and violence than the average person is ordinarily accustomed to watch at films but it certainly is a unique vision from its director at the ruthlessness and paper-thin barrier that separates what we deem so perfect, neat and stable, civilized from complete chaos of passionate and reckless love, envy, death, life's fragilty and, in two words, true human nature, with all its beauty and uglyness intermixed below the surfaceof things. This movies deals with modern human life is also compared to man's best friend, our relationship with them and the very similarities of our feelings, being difficult to distinguish from that of a so called inferior species when we, with our precious mind, civilization and urbanity tend almost always to think better of ourselves.

All of the three stories in the film are quite excellent. My favorite story however is the first one that we are introduced to when the movie opens. The trials and tribulations and everyday survival of Octavio and Susana make the film a winner right from the start.

1630225,5,B00005N8A9,"Amores Perros is a Mexican film by 21 Grams director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu that involves three interlocking stories of love, violence, loss, and dogs. Yes, dogs.

The first segment of three in the 150-minute movie involves a young man named Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who puts his rottweiler Cofi into dog fights, in which Cofi literally kills all his competition, and makes some nice coin along the way, which he hopes will convince his troubled brother Ramiro's mistreated young wife Susana (Vanessa Bauche), pregnant with Ramiro's second child, to come away with him. The segment begins and ends with the climactic car crash that links the three stories.

Segment two focuses on up-and-coming model/actress Valeria (Goya Toledo) and her beau, Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero), a magazine publisher who has left his wife and two daughters to be with her. In the new apartment they share, Valeria's dog Richie accidentally ends up underneath the floorboards, and the couple are at a loss for ideas on how to get him out, especially since they can't even see him and don't know if he's scared, trapped, or lost under there. This, coupled with Valeria's deteriorating health and uncertainty about her professional future, allows complications to arise in the relationship.

In the final segment, a seemingly down-on-his-luck guerilla-turned-hitman (Emilio Echevarria) is hired to take out a yuppie's partner for reasons not apparently clear. The hitman has also recently rescued a dying dog and attempting to nurse it back to health, adding him to the already bountiful stable of pooches that follow him around as he pushes his cart around town. The hitman has unfinished business from his past that he is also dealing with - and an opportunity arises for him to set things right and carry out his own designs on the hit for which he has been commissioned.

It is near impossible not to get completely absorbed in this film. The characters are so well drawn out, and each given hints of ambiguity that it is so easy to relate to every one of them - because we can immediately recognize them as humans, not just people in movies. Innaritu's documentary style of filmmaking - nearly every shot done with a handheld camera - makes us feel as if we're spying on real life.

As far as the involvement of dogs: it's a stroke of genius. Pay attention to the scene near the end when two characters, each carrying a massive amount of enmity toward the other, are unleashed on one another. Besides the species, how is this different from a dog fight? Parallels are drawn throughout the film between dogs and humans; we can be at times loyal, scared, hurt, and vicious. Unlike most movies, Amores Perros does not seek easy answers to life's hardest questions.",1110326400,8,2747,4.911637931034483
1630226,2,B00005N8A9,"I never thought I would utter the following phrase, ""This movie was just too dark for me.""

3 LONG stories all linked around a car crash scene that opens the movie. Each story not only involves, but is centered around characters' relationships with dogs. I am not a dog person, but I do consider myself an animal lover (go figure). All three ""shorts"" (I use that term loosely) shows dogs getting either hurt or killed. It was not enough for me to be offended or grossed out or upset, but it did hurt my opinion of the movie.

My thoughts are not all negative towards Amores Perros. I did like how the main characters/dog owners in each story are just like the dogs with which they keep company. Parallels can easily be drawn between the characters and the dogs. In this way to suggest that we are not so unlike dogs and that we are not necessarily as civilized as we like to think was very well done.

I think the percentage of people who would like it is so small that the odds are not in your favor. If you do happen to see it and do like it, I will stand corrected. That said, good and bad both shown above, it is my recommendation that you should pass.",1110326400,,1156,4.245454545454545

I think what they mean when comparing Perros to Pulp is the visual aspect of the movie, not the story. The story to Perros is much more deep than Pulp and it really is a story of ""LOVE"" and the many forms in which it takes (from the love which dogs have for their human companions which, in this trio of stories, brings out the love which humans have not only for their dogs but also for other humans).

Amores Perros is a highly original film that takes on the ambitious task of connecting three plotlines.  It actually does a pretty good job even if there are a few holes.  However, everything else is so good that the flaws are almost unnoticeable.",1105401600,3,445,4.5125
1630230,4,B00005N8A9,"It's been compared to Pulp Fiction, but this is a very different movie. Yes, the director uses some techniques that remind you of Tarantino's second venture,but that's where the similarities end. Oh, yes, there is a second resemblance in that both offer unappetizing levels of violence and harsh language.

 But Amores Perros is a far more moving film than Pulp Fiction. Tarantino, for all his obvious skills, is unable to get you to feel for his characters. Inarritu's(the director of Amores Perros'), greatest talent, on the other hand, is his ability to show you their very essence. Sometimes, however, they do appear to be somewhat shallow and naively romantic, but that is to be expected, perhaps, in a movie that tries to explore so many dimensions of modern urban life.

 The only notable flaw with the movie is its length,which was also my chief gripe with ""Pulp Fiction"". That however, is the major drawback of the whole medium of cinema--unlike a book, a movie just cannot hope to go on indefinitely, even if it is a very good one. Still, a very good movie is a very good movie, even if it does tire viewers out towards the end, and Innaratu's debut definitely falls in that rank. It could have been even better, it could have been excellent with some more editing perhaps, but this being a first movie,and one that comes from a country that isn't known to have a particularly strong cinematic tradition (perhaps I am ignorant), is allowed to have a few warts.",1098230400,6,1470,4.73046875

1630233,5,B00005N8A9,"There have been many movies where it seems obvious that the director has been inspired Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" but few of those films live up to that standard as well as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's 2000 film ""Amores Perros.""  The title translates as ""Love's a Bitch"" and there is an intentional irony in that because dogs are a crucial element in each of the interwoven stories.  However, saying this is ""Pulp Fiction"" with dogs misses the point.
""Amores Perros"" begins with a frantic car chase in which two men with a founded dog in the back seat of an old car are being pursued by guys with guns in a souped up pick up truck through the streets of the city.  The prologue ends with a scene that is the nexus for the three stories written by Guillermo Arriaga, although we will not know that until we return for the second of three visits to this particular moment.
The first story is about ""Octavio and Susana.""  He (Gael Garca) is a young man who is love with the teenage bride (Vanessa Bauche) of his brother Ramiro (Marco Perez), who is a thug.  Octavio has dreams of taking Susana far away and when an opportunity comes to make money off of the family pet Cofi in dog fights, he takes advantage of it.  Of course his complex plan comes down to one last big chance to score, which is just another way for Fate to play with him.
""Daniel and Valeria"" is about a television producer (Alvaro Guerrero) who has left his wife and children for the young and beautiful Valeria (Goya Toledo).  Their happy home starts to fall apart when a small part of their living room floor gives way and Valeria's little dog end up underneath the floorboards.
In the final segment we finally find out about a bearded, scruffy looking street person that we have seen throughout the film.  In the final segment, ""El Chivo and Maru,"" we find out that El Chivo, ""The Goat"" (Emilio Echevarria) is living in an abandoned building and is a hit man for hire.  In addition to ending up taking care for one of the main characters from the first story, El Chivo is hired by a man who wants to have his business partner killed.  However, El Chivo discovers one interesting fact about his victim that makes him decide to play out this job a little differently.
""Amores Perros"" is two-and-a-half hours long, which is a long time to read subtitles, but worth it.  Arriaga creates characters with substantial depth and first time director Inarritu invests the stories with flair.  The result is a compelling combination of visceral violence and passion, neither of which comes across as being gratuitous.  The violence here matters, as compared to the bloodfest in ""Cidade de Deus,"" where all the killing is just a constant waste of lives.  Granted, Ktia Lund and Fernando Meirelles are making a much more political point in their film, but I am still struck by the artist range of how violence can be used in such films where the goal is more than to make money and give adolescents cheap thrills.
Translation: These films made ""south of the border"" reflect a better appreciation for the reality of violence then what is coming out of Hollywood.
Final Note: The DVD for ""Amores Perros"" has a several music vidoes, which seems strange given the subject matter, but proves to be rather interesting.  You would think the film's subject matter would not lend itself to such promotions, but, again, I think we are coming up against some significant cultural differences worth noting.",1086912000,3,3459,4.666118421052632

1630236,5,B00005N8A9,"This movie has rare power. There is a kind visceral violence here that is really wrenching.  American films are rarely in this league.  I could taste the blood in my mouth while I watched this thing, and I surely felt the ulcers of these characters. The story is fast and character-driven and subtle.
For me, it touched the hard-wires at the back of my brain. The whole movie experience completely envelopes and separates the audience from the here and now and takes us to the Mexican dreamworld.
The acting is almost invisible. The feeling is fly-on-the-wall such that I felt I knew these people in their most personal moments, full of rivalry, blood-lust, anger.. All sorts of brilliant, burning taboo emotions that are rarely porrayed in mainstream film.
Innaritu has a very direct style and a lot of fire in the blood.  His style requires no setups - He basically launches the characters into tense, brutal events, forming plots that dovetail together in perfect synchronicity.  He's a Picasso to George Lucas's etch-a-sketch.
I don't know if he'll ever be a box-office hero - there are no kid-friendly puppet-contraptions in the works - but this guy is a cinema superstar and a true artist. His work will last.  Also see '26 Grams' with Naomi Watts, another film worth it's weight in gold.",1078704000,4,1294,4.83710407239819
1630237,3,B00005N8A9,"While it's a high-action, low-plot film with a creative patchwork of screenplay, Amores Perros is definitely a movie you should watch at least once. It's effortlessly fresh and original.
The movie's style is certainly inspired by the stylism of Pulp Fiction or Traffic. That is, it consists of three stories that tie themselves together in the end. This method of film making has become such a clich, but it can be done if the director succeeds in making each story equally interesting. Unfortunately, Amores Perros starts with a bang, but its final two stories drag on while the viewer struggles to stay awake. (And it is a looong movie!)
The first story of the film is, to say the least, brilliant. It revolves around a young man named Octavio (Gael Bernal) who enters the bizarre world of dog-fighting so he can earn enough money to run away with his abusive brother's wife and child. Things, however, do not go exactly as expected, as the dog-fighting goes terribly wrong, and Octavio's dream of running away is crushed.
As far as the first story goes, Inarritu did not wrong. In fact, it's easy to say that this segment of the film is flawlessly executed. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting and the lighting all come together to create quite a spectacle. The fact that Inarritu chose to use this segment first was really a poor decision. When it ends, I was left looking for something at or around the same caliber, and I was greatly disappointed with what came next.
The second story concerns a model named Valeria (Goya Toledo) living with a her boyfriend who left his wife just to be with her. The beginning of the story is intriguing, but the ironic coincidence is that when the two lovers' lives begin to fall apart, the movie takes a turn for the worst as well. Instead of the entertaining and fast paced love thriller Amores Perros had been to this point, I was now treated to a obnoxiously slow and boring tale of a degenerative relationship.
Story three is, well, better, but that's not saying much. The story revolves around a supposedly mysterious man who gave up his family and life to become a rebel. His rebel days behind him, the man (Emilio Echevarria) is now a bum/assassin for hire who walks around with a pack of dogs. During a 'job' the man rediscovers his former self, and realizes what a grave mistake he had made by leaving his family. This part had vast potential but it's clear that the director did not try to develop this man's character for a sort of mysterious effect. Sadly, I found that I knew so little about the character that I really couldn't care less what his fate was.
As a whole, Amores Perros stacks up to be a slightly above average movie. It runs simply far too long, and it does not focus enough on the first story, which is the only thing really carrying the film.
But that shouldn't detract you from watching it at least once. It's a very worthy rental if only for the glimpses of directorial brilliance.",1078531200,25,2966,4.619318181818182

The great thing about this film is that any Joe without knowledge of Mexico or the Spanish language can enjoy the film for its engrossing dynamic, powerful images, great acting and uniqueness....and even the most careful student of Mexico's socio-econo-political history will have hour upon hour of coffee shop debate ammunition.  For example, there is the executive who leaves his wife to hook up with a super model.  He buys a condo to live with his new partner (the wife & daughter remain in their chic home) but doesn't have the money to repair a hole in the hardwood floor.  The seemingly insignificant hole is a catalyst for a surprising future tragedy.  I interpreted this scene as commentary on the government's economic mismanagement of the 70's where they spent too much money on beautiful landmarks, universities & museums - banking on high oil prices - and after oil prices crashed where not able to renovate aging infrastructure or provide simple social services in the 80's.

Back to the film itself, which was directed by a FIRST TIME director, which left me thinking that this man will be a force to reckon with.
I won't go into the plots as I don't like it when reviewers give too much away, but I can safely say that this movie captures the imagination in such a way that it's making me think that Mexico is the new center of true film makers. I had not felt such a rush after seeing a movie since ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (which also is also a Mexican production and stars the appealing and expressive Gael Garcia Bernal). I don't wan't to compare the two movies as they are both magical in their own manners, but point here is that Mexico appears to be as fertile as Spain was/is when it comes to getting right.
Every single peformance is masterful, the script is unique and quite rich in its scope, and the directing, ah the directing, is one of the BEST (if not the best) first efforts that I've ever seen and I would extend that perception to put this movie next to ANY the best efforts by directors in Hollywood (Spielberg, Scorcese, Oliver Stone (at one time, but I am always hoping for him to come back with a good movie) et al) and my feeling is that this movie is as ""good"" as any other. I hate to compare movies and choosing the ""best"" is a disservice to art in general, but this movie is so spectacular that it made me think of movies that I have enjoyed more or had impacted me more, and there were few I could compare it to.
The title ""Amores Perros"" is perfect as although the movie involves love at all levels and dogs in every tale, these elements serve to bring to life three linked stories that are so different yet indicative of universal emotions. Some had called this the Mexican ""Pulp Fiction"" and I think that this is a disservice to two great movies. Although the narrative in ""Amores Perros"" is not linear and the mvies did have that in common, the three stories here could not have been told with the same visceral and emotional scope had they been shown in more conventional form.
I can't wait to see this movie again, and if you speak Spanish, you are truly in for a treat, as many nuances (both in terms of dialogue and social commentary) are missed even if you not Mexican, which I am not. Watching it on DVD allows you to go back to something that you may have not heard/understood (lots of slang) or want to see again, and the joint commentary by the writer and director is truly a ""bonus"" and not just filler. They tell you what they had in mind and some of the challenges that they encountered in making this virtuoso film, including clarifying an extremely important plot development that was probably missunderstood due to a casting oversight which had very similar looking actors who could have been confused for one another and that was not at all the intention of the director.
Ultimately the film is enriched by the commentary and the deleted scenes portion is great for any storyteller or movie fan to see in that final cut is 153 minutes (which fly by) and the deleted scenes show some of what constitutes what was initially a movie that started out being 193 minutes. To me what was extracted actually helped the movie and seeing some scenes made me see how sometimes there is such a thing as overkill or elements that are not essential to the story.
This is certainly a movie for adults so keep that in mind when the buy, rent, or find some way to see it. It is a must and carries my highest recommendation.",1074211200,5,3835,4.39521800281294

The editorial review sums it all up quite nicely, as it said that the film explores passion, loss, and the fragility of our lives. Expect sudden shifts in plot and a healthy dose of violence as well, which is all done with care and reason. I hope the dogfights were fake.
There are multiple stories, but each is connected to the other (the dogs and a particular 'meeting' are key here), and each story is deep and rewarding.
This is a compelling film, and I can't forget it (not that I want to). Intense and Very good.",1068422400,4,899,4.487804878048781
1630248,5,B00005N8A9,"Mexican Director, Alejandro Gonzales, tortures you in a complex threesome of existence, compelling the unbearable truth about the being into every day resistance against the Abyss of life (La soledad es la ulterior realidad de la existencia), inner self towards oblivious despair, you live to suffer, either your tragedy is because you have attained all your goals, or because you attained none. So sad their ways, one held by a prohibited love, she is caught in motion, and the last one is frozen in cold-blooded hands. Octavio falls in love with his brother's pregnant wife, a young woman much dismissed in emotions, entering an attempt to save the poor girl from her abusive husband. Slowly it turns into a moral inner truth. Is it the right thing to do, or not? He survives the meantime with profits by his fighting dog. Valeria is a breathtaking beauty, crowned in a seductive perfume advertisement, the kind of woman we men dream of. Once his little dog is lost in her house floor, she becomes trapped in a upraising impossibility, the dog becomes the analogy of her misery, interior self intolerance (No hay nada peor que haber permanecido en estado de gracia, solo para caer y no volver a levantarse). El Chivo (The Goat), hunts human targets, just for a bunch of dirty money, he doesn't care for anyone but him and his dogs, and so, when payback time comes, the price is much to high, slowly he rots, innards decay (Solo y aislado, como un perro callejero). The gathering comes in a brutal car crash, all shown in the most painful and tragic context, the point here is to put you into the misery of these three decadent humans (Tan decadente y sucio como una cloaca, donde hay de todo, y donde todo huele mal).
The film is more than images and words, it is a worthy Canvas of human entrails and putrid lost consciousness, Alejandro Gonzales directs with great delight and compassion the nexus between despair and emptiness, the result comes natural and honest towards the viewers eye, a jewel in the new Latin American Film movement, a landmark achievement an a testament of tragic ideals. The outstanding cast shines in every scene, Gael Garcia Bernal (Octavio), captivates his character with a keen exposure of emotions and roughness, along with touches of despair (Complejo). Spanish actress Goya Toledo, gives a intricate portrait of loneliness, sharp and raw in its manifestations, held in beautiful tears (Vulnerable). And Emilio Echevarria, fools the eye with a cold and emotional personality, tight up by a black humor to provide an ambiguous view of a lost man with some tenderness left in his soul (Contundente). The supporting cast does an equally fine job. Alejandro Gonzales, performs an excellent behind the camera work, his direction connects those hard images with the quantity and truth of the protagonist (a Tarantino influence can be perceived). The photography becomes the other character surrounding the viewer's eye into a world of frenzy and ulterior terror, an achievement that completes and enhances the whole effort, absolutely amazing (the new Mexican cinema).
Amores Perros is based in a very difficult and complex script by novelist Guillermo Arraiga, set perfectly into screen by Alejandro Gonzales , the intention is to show how the human conscience can be turn against it self for what ever reason, the result is a Inner struggle for unparallel obstacles, and the strength that comes and goes with it.
The film represented Mexico for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001 Academy Awards, unfortunately it didn't win, but the influence of the film has made a mark already in Latin American film industry, a much needed and deserved attention to our great movie artists. There are two DVD versions (in Region 1), the first one released by Lions Gate studio (February 18, 2003), witch comes with no extras at all, but only with an O.K. transferring of the film, and the second one, released by Studio Home Entertainment (September 25, 2003), that comes with a better transferring of the film (5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound), a nice production commentary track, music videos, etc. (this is the version to take home).
Shocking, extreme, and sad. Amores Perros is a fine piece of Marginal characters made up with enough strength to put the harsh truth into a trip of sight and sound (Exquisita y portentosa, verdadera referencia de lo mejor del cine Latino Americano).",1067644800,7,4403,4.94331983805668

1630250,5,B00005N8A9,"This Mexican film is so good that it was nominated for an Academy Award in 2001.  It's a true drama in every sense of the word and even at 153 minutes, it held me captivated.  There are three stories, and each of them could be a full feature in its own right.  But they interconnect by a chance traffic accident.  And each character's life is affected by it in different ways.  All the stories have to do with love.  All the stories have to do with death.  And all the stories have to do with dogs.  In fact, in each story, the dog is as much as a character as the people.
The first story stars Gael Garcia Bernal, who later became well known for his roles in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""The Crime of Padre Amaro"".  He wants to earn money to run away with his young sister-in-law who is being mistreated by his brother.  And so he uses his dog in dogfights.  The film opens with a wild chase scene in which he is fleeing from a competing dog fighter.  That's when the accident occurs.
The second story is about a beautiful model and her lover who leaves his wife and children for her.  She has a dog, which she loves as if it were a child.  She is injured in the accident and becomes wheelchair bound.  When her little dog gets trapped under the floorboards in her new apartment, the story escalates.
The third story is about a homeless man, a former revolutionary, who makes his living as an assassin.  He owns several dogs and rescues the fighting dog from the accident.  As the story moves along we discover that his has abandoned his family years before.  His grown daughter thinks he is dead and has no idea that he follows her around.
This is a very simple outline of the story but it is much more than that.  Each character is deeply developed and I felt I was inside of each of them.  I held my breath at times as the stories took yet another twist.  And I felt deep emotion for each of their plights.  I also loved the dogs.  And I thought the stories were fresh, interesting and meaningful on many levels.  They were sad, and yet very complete.  And at the end I felt a catharsis of emotion that is present so many works of art.

I must admit that I am not a fan of foreign films but after watching this, I can't believe that Mexico could do a movie much better (in my opinion) than most Hollywood movies.  I especially liked the action sequences such as the car crash, the dog fights, and of course, Richie!
  I've read some of the reviews and I noticed that there are some people who were offended because of the graphic dog fight scenes.  I don't think you should be offended because aside from the exquisite animal prosthetics and make-up used for the dogs, the dog fight sequences are necessary to deliver a dog-eat-dog-world message to the character of Octavio, and his brother Ramiro.

1630253,5,B00005N8A9,"As you may or may not assume, I am a common frequenter of my videostore. I have spent a lot of time browsing the isles; fishing through the often mediocre selection of film, looking to find the perfect poison for killing 90 to 120 minutes of a summer afternoon. As I spend a lot of time here, I've come to notice a few things about the goings on of the place. One of the more important things I've noticed is that the New Releases section seems to have it's own set of seasons. There are times when good movies are as abundent as freckles on a stereotypical Irishman. However, the seasons do change, and then there is a long drought, with dustballs like 'The Real Cancun' and 'The Guru' rolling about the arid plains of New Releases. When this film ""drought"" occurs, I spring into action and head down to the Foreign section, for it's dawned on me that since only the better of the foreign stock make it to the States, I'll always be in for a decent (at worst) film. But enough of my drawn out, pseudo-professional anecdote. The point is: I went to the foreign section, rented Amores Perros, and watched one of the best movies of the past twenty years.
  This movie ranks up right alongside Pulp Fiction in great films of the new generation of directors. The script is a strong one: combining an excellent story (three stories interwoven, but that makes it all the better) and authentic dialogue--a real treat for those who look beyond eye candy. However, the cinematography is just as powerful as the script, combining quick, fast shots, jumps, and long stills to a dazzling effect. The acting too, is wonderful. It's believable, and professional--all that's needed for a great movie. This is indeed a great movie. I don't like wasting words on plotline, because it just spoils the film, so I will just say this: watch the movie and it will take you in. It's completely emersing, and although it runs a little overtime (150 minutes or so), the lag isn't really noticable, as everything is so engaging. The worst crime that a director can perpetrate is to make an incomplete film for sake of time. We have a long film, but a complete film. You leave feeling satisfied, not wanting more.
  This film is excellent, and anyone who appreciates film can tell you this. Do not take the time to read the childish rants of 1-star reviewers, for they are all essentially the same. Allow me to paraphrase their worthless tirades: ""They hurt dogs. I love my puppies and I was offended. I mean, think of the dogs! All those poor dogs! If I think of poor Rufus in those dog fights, oooh my little schnookims! PS: it was a little long."" Look, as the good man from Mexico says on this site: the world is not the ""smiles and sunshine"" atmosphere of suburban Arizona. People do this, and it's shedding light on an ugly practice. If anything, it's making us more aware of the horrors of dog fighting. Do not give this movie a bad review if you're too squemish, because then you're not judging the movie, you're judging your tolerance factor, and therefor your opinions are not valid, at all. My family owns a dog. I love him very much. Is it slightly disturbing to watch the dogfights? Yes. But that doesn't make the movie any less brilliant.
Watch this movie if you want to see something new and original. It will leave you amazed.",1057276800,10,3314,4.536789297658863
1630254,5,B00005N8A9,"Of course, there is no one answer; instead, we have three answers. 'Amores Perros', this very particular spanish production, is about the crossing of three different lives, which reveal all about the life itself, and not necessarily only my question above.
The movie starts with a chase in the traffic; we see two guys running away from another bunch of guys. Just when they think the chase is over, they end up crossing at the red light and crashing with another car, which is driven by a woman, a very beautiful woman actually. One may get puzzled with an introduction like this; but it's better that way. This scene is the literal and physical intersection of the different lives, whereas the rest of the movie is all about the emotional intersections, I presume.
Let me briefly mention how the three different lives look like... The first part of this long movie - really, you have to spare 157 minutes from your life to see this film - depict the life of Octavio, who we see in the chase, and his family. They're poorly off; and this causes some sort of tension in the family members' relations with each other. Octavio's love for his brother's wife creates yet another problem. What Octavio and his brother do for earning money is very saddening to see: Octavio puts his dog into fights for bets, whereas his brother robs places in the city. The second image is of a beautiful woman, who has recently modelled for a perfume commercial. She is the mistress of a married man, who does not want to see his family. And the third is of an old man, who does killing for earning. He lives in debris, yet he's a noble man.
How these lives connect with each other - other than the accident - is for you to see. The film has a lot to offer for everybody. 'Amores Perros' is an essential film, that nobody should miss for whatever reason. And, yes, beware of the fact that the dog fight scenes contain explicit violence that might be bothering for some.",1054771200,3,1948,4.521246458923513
1630255,4,B00005N8A9,"I had fairly high expectations for this film based on the amount of film festival awards it won, and it did not disappoint. It definitely comes from the Tarantino school of film-making, and since Tarantino himself has left his fans high and dry for several years, Amores Perros comes at just the right time.
The film is gritty and brutally realistic and confronts the dark aspects of life that most of us choose to try to ignore. Our dreams and hopes for the future are fragile, and more often than not, are subject to come crashing down around us when the slightest unforseen event comes into conflict with them. Amores Perros is recognizing this uncomfortable truth about life and forcing us to recognize it as well. We can envision what we want to happen, but we must also be ready for anything to come along and blindside that vision.
The film shows us this universal truth while seamlessly blending three different stories together, united by one chance incident. This aspect of the film also sheds light on the fact that even the smallest event in our lives can change us and our relationships with those we love forever. We aspire to reach the plateau of love, but seldom prepare ourselves for loss.
Over the past few months, I have seen the two critically acclaimed films out of Mexico, Amores Perros and Y Tu Mama Tambien, and all I have to say is that Hollywood had better get its act together. Fans of intelligent, thought provoking film can find what they are looking for elsewhere instead of lapping up the mindless drivel that permeates too much of American film.",1052611200,6,1577,4.676258992805756

This film, while very ""heavy"", is just so well done.  It beautifully intertwines three different stories, with a car crash being the one thing all the parties have in common.  One party was from the car that crashed, the second party was in the car that got hit by the first, and the third party came upon the crash, and rescued an injured dog in the back seat of the first car.  Dogs play a central role in each of the stories.

1630259,5,B00005N8A9,"From Mexico, from some huge urban environment, a film has emerged that stuns, angers, seduces, and challenges us. Director Alejandro Gonzaliz Inarritu has created a dark vision of the trinity; three overlapping plots and three sets of overlapping characters, impaled at their core by a horrible car crash; a crash that touches and changes all of them. It has a stark veneer of sadness, but it is beautifully photographed in bursts of Latin colors; scenes of carnival juxtaposed with scenes of seduction, murder, violence, and lethal lonliness.
This unique vision vibrates, reasonates, throbs, and is inhabited by dogs; from vicious killers to lap pooches. These canine players emerge as the conscience, and the soft underbelly of the film. All of the film's main characters own a dog, or many dogs. The people behave like pack animals; they identify with and behave like their dogs. Often they love their dogs more than they do their fellow man; and what they covet, what they love the most...they destroy. The scenes of professional dog-fighting were, of course, shocking beyond measure. Somehow one knows the deaths and bloodshed were F/X, but each time it happened we had to recheck our reality meter.
During the overlap of lives and plots, there are restarts of the scenario from fresh perspectives. This movie hits hard, and we are left limp from the experience.

In this city they'll all meet sooner or later to find out that their lives are similar at one level...the suffering. And that's what the movie is all about. A series of events that collide on a big crash where all characters get to the lower point they ever expected to be in their lives.

1630261,5,B00005N8A9,"""Let's say it up front: Amores Perros is shocking. A shock in its camera work, a major accomplishment on its own, in its writing, and finally, and most importantly, its subject matter. It's a shock because Iniarritu uses all the cinematic tools to make us feel and understand what we all have somewhere inside us, refrained or forgotten, that which we don't understand. This is probably why, even if the violent images, as well as the camera movements - is sometimes hard to sustain, during the first international public screening at the Cannes Film Festival, a long silence followed the end credits and little by little people stood up and gave the director an extremely long standing ovation. It's also why the New York Times called Amores Perros: ""the first classic of the new decade,"" adding that some of its scenes will live on in film history. Yes, Amores Perros is almost a masterpiece. The film talks about politics, poverty, violence, modern society, relationships, love, betrayal, lost ideals but all this is said through the ""mise-en-scene"" of feelings and emotions. It's never delivered by a speech or a forced point of view, but always perfectly linked with the characters and the story. Even the construction, mixing past and present and different stories, is wonderfully brought to us by the characters and their emotions, not as a gratuitis artefact as may other filmmakers do. Inniaritu is definitely a major filmmaker, both technically and with the narrative, to convey what he has to say, which is a lot. He does it in a very subtle way, showing us for example how people care more about dogs than about other human beings. Once again, all the questions we've ever had in our minds are explored on screen by extremely rich characters. So why not a complete masterpiece? Because Iniarritu takes a major risk by mixing three different stories together even if they are linked by a crash. It is on the one hand what makes the movie so rich and so intelligent , yet also what makes it not totally perfect. When you get too attached to brilliant characters and fascinating storytelling, it's hard to let go and plunged in another universe. Still, a major director and a major film, definitely the most accomplished of 2001"". Phil Ed for Au-Cinema.com",1039651200,6,2265,4.855297157622739

There is no mercy with wrong turns, no going back to rectify, no salvation. Redemption may serve others well, but not the protagonists.

This movie is more deeply, reflects the life of citizens in many countries the search of love accomplish with the suffering, the life of the people in each social status and their priorities in their lifes, the chritics saw in Amores Perros this conjugation of elements if you live in one rich country may be the perception of this collide feellings its not clear for you (What is hunger if I never feel it in my own body?), but it can be the reallity of life of one human being in one place of the world not only Mexico, this point of view is very far for any Tarantino movie.
Amore perros shows the art of the reallity sometimes hard and cruel in the search of better way of life for some people only with their own experiences and their whishes like the only elements that guide them trhough the life. The car crash links the lifes of different social status people, it break and transform their current life in one way that they never though and show their priorities of one of them like vanities compared with the opposite life of the other people. The love of the assesin to save the life of the dog returned in dead of all other dogs when the dog love to the assesin (the dog love the assesin but it kills all the other being - dogs - that love him).
The crithics saw in Amores Perros more than this short comment that I am writting the most important art cause controversy in many points of view, but cause immediate appreciation when you see it, if it wins Cannes is because it is a good movie that transform your feeling from the begin to the end of the movie, if you want to see the movie don't expect to see a Hollywood movie or any nice movie if you want to see that, see Harry Potter.

From the first minute of this film the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  One of the greatest car chases for years gives way to a crash and a back-track (and forwards at times) in a move reminiscent of Pulp Fiction (how is it that in a the post Tarantino world that talky films don't work anymore but everyone can disrupt a timeline better then ever ('Go' being a case in point).  I liked talky films).  Here-on, the film works outwards from the various characters involved in the car crash.
When I first watched this film I felt that the middle section (model, lover, dog, yada, yada, yada) but on second viewing this piece became the heart of the film.  It has a quirky yet bleak feel which is easy to miss first-time as it seems not to fit the pace of the film as a whole.
Some will definitly be shocked by the brutality of the dog-fight scenes but you should not listen to reviewers who claim this is a film solely about dog fighting.  I respect that they could not watch the scenes but they should not write reviews for a film they have not seen fully.

1630266,5,B00005N8A9,"""Amores Perros"" is one of the first great masterpieces of the decade. It is a timeless work that will stand as a great example of feverish, driven and visceral filmmaking at its best. It is a masterpiece of film assembly and performance, never fails to engage the viewer and still vibrate with emotion and passion. The director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has announced his genius to the movie-going public with this brilliant debut into the national scene ... The movie opens in exhilarating fashion, with a car chase through Mexico City that culminates in a disastrous crash that leads us into the first of three stories. The first is a romantic tragedy with red-blooded elements of murder and betrayal revolving around dog-fighting. The second story is a brilliant examination of superficial wants destroyed by cruel realities when a super-model loses a leg in the opening car crash. The last story is an emotional tale of a street-bum who is really a hit-man for hire with a shadowy past and a longing for his daughter. The screenplay is a work of great craftsmanship in the way it connects the stories but also how it creates characters and dialogue that feel real and raw. Inarritu has obviously learned from the masters ...  In other words, ""Amores Perros"" is a collage of everything that has made movies fresh, exciting and engrossing through the past decade and now into the 21st century. It will survive the test of time and I suspect it will be a great influence on many future filmmakers. It may very well be the first of a great revival in Hispanic filmmaking, ...

1630269,4,B00005N8A9,"I've recently gone on a foreign language film binge, and this one settles with the cream, near the very top.  Plot wise, there are three stories that interconnect on the basis of a big car accident, and each revolves around dogs and their owners.  The first piece is about a guy who lusts after his older brother's wife while also making big money in dog fights.  The older brother gets more and more angry while at the same time the younger brother has made an enemy at his side job.  The second story is about a middle aged man in the magazine industry who leaves his family and moves in with a beautiful model.  Things get hectic when her lovable ball of fluff disappears beneath a hole in the floor and won't come out.  The final tale is about an ex-professor turned radical turned nearly pennyless hitman who wanders the streets with his group of trustworthy dogs.  Things change for him when he unknowgly nurses a very dangerous mutt back to health.  Now, these stories may not sound intrigiuing at first, but the strengths lie in the tone, cinematography, acting, and atmosphere.  Give it a chance, and I think everyone can take something positive from the experience.  Of course, this takes us to the WARNING: THIS FILM CONTAINS BLOODY IMAGES OF DOG FIGHTING.  The question is, can you handle this sort of thing?  I was prepared, and it wasn't as bad as I thought, but if you go in expecting Fido and Lassie frolicking in the hills at sunset, you may be in for an unpleasant surprise.  In the form of mauled carcasses.  Yep, quite nasty.  But consider the fact that the animals were trained and not harmed, and that the rest of the movie is excellent, and you should be able to bear it.  Also, this film has many levels, and warrants repeated viewing, thus making it a quality purchase.  BUT--because of the dog fights, I can't just flat out recommend that everyone buys it on a whim.  If you're not sure, RENT IT FIRST.  Otherwise, it's a guranteed positive experience.",1027900800,54,1978,4.568181818181818

1630274,5,B00005N8A9,"the story of a street smart working class boy who falls in love with his brother's wife, a successful fashion model who's having an affair with a married businessman, and a lonely vagrant who wants to contact a daughter he hasn't seen in years. These three characters never interact with each other and their stories are only connected through a terrible car crash that changes their lives for ever. The only thing these people have in common is that they own dogs, and their relationships with their pets are as telling as their relationships with other humans. The film moves from the luxury flats to the slums of Mexico City, demonstrating that human passions have little to do with social and economic circumstances. This is an extremely disturbing and violent film, but it never feels excessive or exploitative. Violence is depicted as ugly and pointless, sometimes fortuitous but never cool or glamorous, and it makes people and animals suffer unnecessarily.
Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu's film is destined to become a classic, it does for contemporary Mexico City (or any other large Latin American city) what Taxi Driver did for mid 70's New York. A solid script, inventive and hyper realistic direction, perfectly timed editing and brilliant performances make Love's a Bitch and extraordinary film, a perfect example of how visceral and moving cinema can really be. This is an intelligent and thought provoking movie that will surely be appreciated by anyone who has grown tired of the seemingly endless flow of escapist offerings released every week.
Finally, dog lovers like myself will be reassured to know that this DVD features a short on how the dog actors were trained and looked after and didn't get hurt or mistreated in any way.",1024444800,11,1743,5.0137931034482754

1630276,5,B00005N8A9,"The reason why this film works so beautifully is that beneath the plot veneer of violence and schemes is a common theme of family and strained relationships that connects all the characters. A man falls in love with his brother's wife and plans to run away with her. A contract killer comes to terms with his past in which he left his wife and daughter for a revolutionary cause. A brother wants to kill his half-brother for money. A man leaves his devoted wife to pursue his love for a model... All these characters and situations are drawn beautifully, without easy caricaturization: all the people and situations in this movie are complex. ""Amores Perros"", aside from its dizzying, frenetic plot and action, is one of the more contemplative films about strains of human and familial relationships, and the loneliness that comes from them. The dialogue is tough, but lyrical, and some of the metaphors are very effective. For example, the female model's dog jumps into a hole in the floor and doesn't surface back up. This not only creates a strange tension, but also reflects the psychological unease that accompanies the relationship between the man and the woman.
""Amores Perros"" is a happy confluence of filmmaker's passion and careful craftsmanship. International cinema is fast catching up, and threatening to surpass American cinema.",1023926400,8,1342,5.04954954954955
1630277,5,B00005N8A9,"""Amores Perros"" is a movie that manages to say some very deep truths about Latin America, potraying it in  myriad ways through characters from the top to the very bottom of the social ladder while at the same time being entertaining. Though the movie is quite long, rarely was I aware of this; I was never bored. And in the midst of all the violence and gritty reality of Mexico City that the movie shows with hardly any compromise, there were still many humorous episodes and dialogues that stood out like gems. Specially in the latter part of the movie, the one that deals with 'Chivo', the guerrillero-turned-hitman.

But as the movie ends, with Chivo and his dog walking away in the midst of an unforgiving wasteland like some pathetic John Wayne, it was hard to forget the terrible reality and oppressive lives potrayed in the first two stories (the movie is roughly made of three parts, based around four different people, whose paths sometimes cross). The wasteland reminds me of a photo I saw once in a review of books about Latin America's social and political problems: a wide angle shot of a parched plain and a blue sky, with nothing in the foreground but a burial cross. A cross just like the many that lay next to roads all across the continent.

To me ""Amores Perros"" marks Latinamerica's (for now, maybe just Mexico's) entrance into the mainstream of world cinema. Before it, attempts to potray the continent's troubles ended in pretentious 'auteur' (read: a m a t e u r) cinema with low production values and ideological or artistical heavy-handedness, the kind that only wins you awards in obscure film festivals and often serves as filler for Cannes and the rest of the European festival circuit. I hope Latinamerican directors get rid of their back issues of Cahiers du Cinema and follow's director Gonzalez Irritu's example. Sigue dandole wey!",1022976000,,1864,4.8006230529595015
1630278,5,B00005N8A9,"I've watched this splendid film more times than I care to admit! It's such a great movie that I don't want to ruin it with plot points or a synopsis, so I'll just say this -- the dog fights are horrible and jarring, but it's worth it. The story of loss, love and (of course) dogs is gritty and doesn't sugarcoat life, but ultimately carries an uplifting message. (It's just hard to find amidst all the bloody dogs.)
And one more thing -- Gael Garcia Bernal is the sexiest actor since, well, nobody's ever been sexy enough to compare him with. Watch for him to be the next big thing, not only in Mexico but in the U.S.  I see him winning an Oscar by 30 (or at least deserving one -- but we all know how the Academy tends to treat racial minorities and foreign actors).",1021939200,7,767,4.217687074829932
1630279,1,B00005N8A9,"I should have known better.  A friend who recommended this movie also loved ""Magnolia"" which is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  ""A symphony of human suffering"" is what he called that one.  Well, for those of us who love symphonies, this movie is, like Magnolia, in the realm of Mahler and Bruckner in length.  Unfortunately, the whole time is spent in ugliness.  There is not a moment of sublimity or beauty.
OK, I will cut the film a break for depicting the desperate and disparate circumstances of people in Mexico.  Its best quality is in showing how the impoverished situation of a young man leads to tragedy for a beautiful young model, then to a kind of redemption for a hardened criminal.  But this thing really needed an editor! There is way too much violence, to begin with.  Dog lovers are likely to walk out or turn it off in the first fifteen minutes.
At close to 150 minutes, it gets tiresome, most especially in the ludicrously illogical story of the model.  To begin with, how likely is it that the floorboard of her luxury apartment is going to collapse?  Then, when a gaping hole appears, are she and her lover really going to leave that as is, when her little (terrier) dog is running around the place?  Anyone who has a terrier knows that they are explorers and hunters.  And when the little guy finally explores the subflooring, is it really believable that his owner is not going to go ballistic until he reappears?  Gimme a break.  I am a dog lover (and terrier owner), and this movie tries to depict love for dogs only in the final segment, but the second segment is totally inconsistent with that.  It would have been easy to just show the dog, now in unfamiliar surroundings, just getting lost.  Maybe even suggest that the model is incapable of loving another human.  We don't even get that.
Important to any film is whether we care about the characters.  Here, it is difficult to say. None of the characters are ideal, and that is one kind of realism.  But it is difficult to understand the motivations of the desperate young men who get into dog-fighting; aren't there a lot of other things they could be doing?  Drug-running, gun-running, pimping?  And we never get to see much in the way of the protagonist's  affection toward the fighting dog who in a way is the center of the story.  Not even a single reservation about entering the dog in one fight after another.  Yet we are supposed to believe that he has profound feelings for his brother's wife and offers her tenderness whereas her husband is an insensitive brute.
Graphic, gratuitous violence among fighting dogs is depicted.  I had to listen on headphones because my little guy was so upset to hear the noise of dogs fighting and suffering.  There was way too much of this.
And that kind of sums up the movie--way too much of everything, including the same old story about how nasty characters, sordid circumstances, greed, lust, selfishness, ruthlessness, and, in the end, regrets and bitterness are everywhere, and that people don't work hard enough in their relationships.
Well, I don't need to be reminded of that.
Do yourself a favor and skip it.",1021161600,13,3153,4.646209386281589

1630281,5,B00005N8A9,"I discovered this film by accident.  It played on my tv like a nightmare getting sideswiped by some small glimmer of hope.  And that's pretty much how it plays once you get to the end.  The director carefully lays down loss and shows how three different characters deal with their loss - the loss of love/innocence for the first character; a loss of love and the ability to walk for a model; and finally, a loss of ""family"" from the final character.  As pointed out, all these characters dynamic changes occur through the use of dogs almost as foils for the other characters to discover something they didn't know about themselves.  The first character, a seemingly innocent and caring person - is driven to violence and greed as he enters the underground world of dogfighting.  A model starts losing her love, her ability to walk, and finally her leg as she tries to find her dog.  Finally, a homeless hitman's symbolic family of dogs is lost to one dog - making him realize the importance of his true family and to learn a new value of life.
Any movie that successfully conveys such and uplifting message from a rather down trodden tale deserves some kudos - but that's not the start of what makes this film so remarkable.  The realism of the film is astounding.  The dogfights and the life shattering car wreck are quite easily some of the most shocking pieces caught on film - as they look so real.  The brilliance of the realism also lies in the attention to detail - the careful painting of Mexican life.  The director's portrait is often dark and tainted - not rose colored.  It is a true depiction of culture that is rarely seen on film.  The first segment of the film especially moved me in its portrayal of culture and ideals as it weaves its way around the streets of Mexico.
Finally, Irritu's use of music also shows a certain flare for making a cinematic marvel.  Tracks by such bands as Moenia and Control Machete are awesome in setting the tone for this rather dark, cinematic marvel.  The music is varying - pretty much the tone of the film.  At one point, I found myself in tears, and at others in shock of the horror.  At some moments, I was even able to laugh a bit.  In the end, however, the whole film left me in awe.  Forget it being an amazing foreign film - this is just an amazing film which has layers of meaning about life while at the same time displays an amazing example of filmaking.",1020556800,3,2414,4.457858769931663

1630294,3,B00005N8A9,"Although ""Amorres Perros"" is a fast-paced, suspensful and well made film overall, its message and central themes get buried under tons of violent debris.  This is a film, universally embraced by critics, that makes me question critics themselves.  Does every film have to bleed and gag from the jugular to be creative or innovative these days?  If so, then ""Amores Perros"" accomplishes the feat spectacularly, with more blood, guts and unnecessary voilence than any film in recent memory.  To be sure, under its red glaze and growling bite lies a story of redemption and destiny that deserves to be told.  Unfortunately, the viewer can rarely focus on those moments, since at every turning point, more gory wretchedness awaits.  The sheer toll  of surivival-of-the-fittest weapons and shattered human dreams weighs the film down, and as it unfolds, don't be surprised to find yourself in an embryonic, empty shell-shocked state  - confused, dazed, and wanting to crawl into a safe, warm place.  I sat through the whole thing, but often wanted to run from the room.
As a dog lover, and a true believer in that species' ability to nurture and heal our human conditions, I was especially angered by the incessant, vicious dog fights (think cockfights or bloody bull fights to formulate a mental picture.)  Bloody, torn animals and bodies are everywhere, symbols of the war that rages among the master class, beings themselves though ripped apart by horrific car accidents, bank robberies, infidelities, a caste-like macho culture, incest, non-stop vulgar exchanges, drunken fistfights, gambling, addictions, and personal redemptions with a high toll.  And that's just half the fun.
To be sure, there are cinematic elements here that rival ""Pulp Fiction"" and other gangsta-classics.  The photography work is creatively sleazy, and the story by and large - with its many intersections both real and imagined - is inspired.  But the overuse of gore and guts sometimes recalls ""Caligula"" or a low-rent ""Carrie"", both of which have far more redeeming qualities than this unique, though severely flawed film.  If you prefer your movies on the extremely violent side, and morose just for the sake of being so, ""Amores Perros"" will keep you glued to the spot.
But a few words of advice - if you're in a bad mood for whatever reason, leave the flick for a sun-shiny day.  Avoid personal dramas or confrontations, attitudes and ex-spouses during and after you see it, and please - please - don't watch it with Spot or Snoopy nearby!

Just when you think that you're watching a Mexican Pulp Fiction the tone changes abruptly for the more contemplative second subplot and changes once again for the third subplot.  I found the film's failure to maintain a consistent tone to be jarring.  Consequently it was hard to see the three subplots as part of an integrated whole, even though they were loosely tied together by a car crash (a conceit which I thought was better carried through in Snatch).

I agree with all the praise it has gotten... it is well deserved, and as a Mexican I am glad to see that this artwork was recognized by people around the world.
I feel the negative reviews I heard are unjustified.  Many of the negative reviews I read were in regards to the violent content of the movie.  It surprises me the way some people think... many animal activists actually believed that dogs were harmed on this film.  I am not sure if this was a complement to the gritty realism of the film (but, hey, I saw Saving Private Ryan and never believed for a second anyone was actually shot on Omaha beach in order to film it), or if it is due to a sort of bias towards a country like Mexico (heck, those third world countries have no laws against those types of brutalities).  Well, the extras on the DVD put those doubts to rest... check it out.

1630303,4,B00005N8A9,"All I want to say is that i tire of everyone comparing this to Pulp Fiction soley based on the notion that it connects dissimiliar lives by one tragic event. I find nothing in common with hip,psuedo-mod hipster dialogue based on cruddy seventies films, with a movie that portrays the harshness of everyday Mexican life. This film explores love in its most harrowing and obsessed forms, Pulp Fiction does not. This film is always very realistic and dramatic. Pulp Fiction, again, is not. I try not to assume anything about anyone, but I'd reckon most of the people who compare this film to Pulp Fiction haven't seen the loads of other films that connect dissimiiar lives by one single event. It has been a common way of exploring lives in film format for some time. And putting that aside, the content of the film has nothing to do with Pulp Fiction. I'd also assume, again reluctantly, that many of the people who reviewed this as comparable to Pulp Fiction have not done much serious reading on Mexican culture. The only reason I am even stating my opinion is because if I had not already seen this film and came here to read reviews to see if it was worth buying I would probally lose interest based on the fact everyone compares it  to Pulp Fiction. To compare these films is a dishonor to both , especially for the fact that this is one of the first high quality films that takes palce in Mexico I have seen in ages. Anyways, check out this movie if you are a fan of graphic film with an intense underlying message of deep love and its fragility told through the eyes of many and not few, and also if you are interested in seeing what most of urban mexico is really like.",1005436800,18,1675,4.438311688311688

1630306,4,B00005N8A9,"Sure, the multiple stories overlapping one another has been employed before.  Yes, the theme of each individual story is not exactly one that has not been used repeatedly.  However, the cohesiveness of this movie is nothing short of incredible.  The ability of the first-time director to pull this off commands an immeasurable respect.
The opening scene immediately grabs your attention and the rest of the movie sustains it.  In the beginning, the movie cuts in and out of each of the different plotlines.  It does enough to keep the viewers interested in all three stories before it has to elaborate on each and make these stories converge again towards the end.  This is crucial and it is executed very well.  Unlike 'Pulp Fiction' which hinges on the suspense as the events unfold, 'Perros' doesn't need to do that as it has three substantial stories that generate enough attention individually.
Another aspect that deserves praise is its thematic consistency.  This requires a very strong script and this one's got what it takes.  How do you conjure up three interesting stories that touch upon love and dogs and tie them together while maintaining such consistency?  A brilliant scriptwriter, an awesome script, and a perfect title.
In many areas 'Traffic' failed (such as its inability to form a movie that is not a sum of all its parts), 'Perros' passes with flying colors.  Soderbergh, eat your heart out. If you like 'Traffic' this one is definitely worth your attention.
The DVD has a lot of extras, such as 'The Making of,' and a few music videos, some that I wish I see more regularly on foreign DVDs.",1005091200,3,1614,4.854014598540146

The three stories that become intertwined, are not only believable but force you to contemplate them.  And you actually feel for all the characters involved.
This is simply a masterpiece of original film-making!  There is quite a bit of violence here, but it has far more meaning and far less glamor than a lot of the violence generated by Hollywood.",1004745600,,558,4.673469387755102
1630308,5,B00005N8A9,"(5+ stars)
If you are weak (lots of dog fights/dog blood in the first 45 minutes) please beware.
This movie is the story of love and dogs, what people are willing to do for love, and how people are divinely punished for their choices in life. In the center of each story, a dog is integral, and that too represents a type of love. Three stories set in Mexico City from three different socioeconomic levels (arguably only two), the lives of the protagonists all meet in an intersection at an accident that radically affects their lives. How each person affected overcomes the impact of the accident is the moral to the story... I won't say more, but I will say that it is a VERY good film... It is very difficult (harrowing is my favorite word) especially in the beginning, and seeing someone's life realistically torn apart by an accident (not LITERALLY, just the injury) but I think the end is worth it, not just for the cinematography that lends the right weight to each element, but also to how the resolution to each story really forces you to think about what happened. I enjoy films that are engaging on that level, and while I may be reading into this (I don't think I am), I think that anyone who appreciates intelligent films will watch this more than once (you can put more pieces to-gether the second time around!)  And the sound track is nice.
I suggest it to anyone who can get past the first half hour/45 minutes. An A+++ film.
P.S.  I know, I just kept thinking about my poor little lovely dog getting torn limb from limb...but when I got home, there he was wagging his tail waiting for me!",1004227200,10,1605,4.474402730375426

1630312,4,B00005N8A9,"This Mexican triptych of interwoven dramas has won many awards, and deserves them all.  It has been hailed as a Latin American Pulp Fiction although the opening scene with a bleeding victim on a car rear seat resembles the beginning of Reservoir Dogs, so perhaps the film is a homage to Tarantino in general.
All the performances are excellent, and if the central story is perhaps less exciting than the outer ones, it certainly lingers in the memory.  The film is shot very much in a documentary style, with the camera probing into the violent underbelly of Mexico Citys subculture and (fleetingly) its more affluent inhabitants.  Although it comes in at well over two hours this film had me gripped until the last frame, and I recommend it thoroughly to lovers of fine cinema.
The first story (which all have a link with dogs) centres on a love triangle in which an unemployed young man loves his hoodlum brothers wife, and enters the brutal world of dog fighting.  In the middle tale a glamorous models life takes a horrific downturn when she is separated from her talisman-like pet dog.  The finale shows a dog-loving assassins life reaching a kind of epiphany when he unwittingly takes in a killer to live among his family.
The threads of all their lives are gathered together in a devastating car crash which forms the films climax.  Among the performances, that of Emilio Echevarria as the vagrant assassin is superb.
The DVD is very fine.  Director Alejandro Inarritu (a fantastic talent), shoots in such a realistic style that he rarely uses artificial lighting, so while the anamorphic transfer is very fine and detailed, do not expect a slick Hollywood production.  He is aiming for a gritty realism, and certainly achieves it.  Occasionally there is a touch of grain in the image but for the most part this is a good transfer of a source print that is itself not the last word in cinematic sophistication.
One could be forgiven for believing that his cast were simply dragged off the street and told to perform on location (perhaps some were:  the streetwise manager of the ghastly dog fighting club gives a performance that is remarkable in its greasy seediness).  The sound is also first rate.",1001980800,10,2207,4.796833773087071
1630313,3,B00005N8A9,"The film is the directorial debut of its director (Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu ) and was chosen as Mexico's selection for consideration for the best Foreign Language Film Oscar for 2000 (and received a nomination). The film tells 3 stories set in Mexico City that all intersect with a car accident, and all show how people are burned by love. The film has solid production values. The 1st, and most compelling, story shows the seedy world of dogfighting. A character discovers his dog has a killer instinct & uses it to earn the money that will allow him to leave town with his brother's wife, with who he is sleeping. This is the strongest section of the film & really manages to portray a side of Mexico we rarely see in films. The film is absolutely raw here, and there aren't a lot of pulled punches in the depiction of the dogfighting. Putting this gritty section 1st definitely works to the film's advantage, as it catches the viewer off guard. As I commented to my friend who was watching with me, ""If the film has the guts to kill DOGS, you know all bets are off!"" This is definitely a film that would face hell if it was made in America.
The 2nd story shows a model who has broken her leg (in the intersecting car accident) and is confined to her new apartment which she recuperates. Unfortunately, her small dog falls in a hole in the hardwood floor that was made while she was moving in. Without her income as a model, she cannot afford to tear up the floor, and she and her lover are forced to listen to the dog whimpering at night, as they imagine it being terrorized by the rats that also live in the hole. This section of the film definitely works as well... the terror is palpable, since we've seen what's happened to the dogs in the 1st 1/3 of the film.
The 3rd story is the film's weakest, but is far from a failure, and it contains the film's best performance. It centers on a homeless ex-guerilla who is contracted by a man who wants to kill his brother... The hitman has other plans however... This section of the film is probably a little too simple-minded for its own good. The film's energy level is high, and its subject matter warrants comparisons to Pulp Fiction. It manages to hold up relatively well in that respect, surprisingly. It's missing a lot of the wit, however, that made Pulp Fiction a classic. In addition, the stories never come together in a way that really enlightens, but that's not to say the film is anything less than entertaining.",1000080000,4,2475,4.477876106194691

AP explores life with its intermittent signs of respect, responsability, and trust; and the most frequent displays of passion, which lacking intimacy, fuels an ever strengthing cycle of decaying interpersonal relationships. Beautiful cinematography and masterful direction, yet; a terrifying, shocking awakening of our consciousness to the realities of our lives.

I think that all children should be forced to watch ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" until they become so desensitized to violence that they become WWF fans. Or maybe not. But violence definitely does have a place in film and, unfortunately, in life. The two films that ""Amores Perros"" is constantly compared to, ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Taxi Driver,"" are both excellent, nay, classic films that prominently feature (""star,"" if you will) violence. But here's why they're better and more tolerable than ""Amores Perros,"" the thunder from down under (down under Texas). ""Pulp Fiction"" is bloody and violent and disrespects life, but it's darned funny. The violence, while central, is not omnipresent and overpowering. In ""Amores Perros,"" there's no let-up, no respite from the horror. After two and a half hours, one tends to get numb and woozy. ""Taxi Driver"" is dark, and not funny, but you can see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. There's a point; the story's good; you feel complete at the end. Here, we're just left wandering, as is the character at the end of the film, along a charred black landscape. And we don't even have a dog.",992390400,7,1357,4.754237288135593
1630322,4,B00005N8A9,"The official line is that this is the Mexican 'Pulp Fiction'.  If we must be lazy, than the true comparison is with Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Magnolia'.  As in that film, the godlessness of the society depicted in the interjecting narratives is contrasted with the godlike powers of the director, who creates patterns, contrivances, accidents at random.
The effect is a conflict between characters struggling to assert themselves (in families, relationships, the society they live in, plots of the film) and external forces constantly buffeting them.
The style is bleached 'Taxi Driver' and its imitators, but the philosophy is the Wim Wenders of 'Paris Texas', especially in the thematically central story of El Chivo, an ex-bourgeois-turned-jailed-Sadinista-turned-assassin, whose quest for his true self necessitates leaving behind the Mexico city that embroils the other characters, the gangsters, confused teens, abused wives, abandoned mothers, harried husbands, paralysed models.",991180800,8,984,5.826388888888889
