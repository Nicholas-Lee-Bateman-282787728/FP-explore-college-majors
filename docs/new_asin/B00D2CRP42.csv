5767445,5,B00D2CRP42,"It's really no mystery that the most popular silent films on DVD are comedies. But to assume that this territory is covered by Chaplin, Keaton, and Harold Lloyd is a big mistake. Even their best work was done during the silent era so clearly we are fascinated - and hugely entertained - by the genre itself. Ben Model has produced this first volume of silent comedy gems from the second tier craftsmen who knew their stuff and were the Laugh meisters of their era. These comedies were quickly made without the time lavished by the stars of the genre. But are these funny? Yes, hugely so!

So far, I've watched three: MARRIAGE SLIPS (1928) with Monte Collins, SHOOTING STRAIGHT (1923) with Paul Parrott, and LOOSE CHANGE (1928) with Jack Duffy. OK, the names Collins, Parrott, and Duffy don't have the same ring as Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd but when you love the silent comedy genre, you can't help liking these films. I'm looking forward to watching the remaining films on the disc, none of which should even be in existence today, hence the title ACCIDENTALLY PRESERVED. We are lucky to have them and luckier still that Ben Model decided to make them available on DVD.

Ben Model the producer wisely delegated the musical accompaniment to Ben Model the musician. This music does exactly what the best silent film music is supposed to do: it compliments the visuals and doesn't compete with them. Technically, this disc is professionally presented in the best tradition of the big boys. I like that fact that we are informed that the films are from 16mm and not the better-looking 35mm format. but the transfers are so professionally handled that the films have a 35mm quality. Highly recommended on all counts!",1371340800,,1712,4.8
5767446,5,B00D2CRP42,"Ben Model did a great job getting these rare silent films from the can to a dvd in your hand. A long process to be sure but well worth it. He also plays a mean piano and organ as the accompanist to these films. If you like silent comedy and have seen everything else in your collection a million times (and how do you have that much time on your hands? Get out of the house once in a while!), then this collection is for you. As for the rest of you, this collection is also for you. And me. Thanks, Ben.",1371168000,,503,3.9411764705882355
5767447,5,B00D2CRP42,"To paraphrase the liner notes, all of the films in this set would never have survived to the current age had it not been for the 'accidental' preservation of them by the marketers of silent movies destined for the home movie market. These entrepreneurs copied their films from the fragile, nitrate celluloid stock, to the relatively new 'safety' film stock, which proved much more stable through the years. This is the only reason we are afforded an opportunity to watch them today. Most of their direct ancestors have been lost to the ravages of time, never to return.

You won't find the 'big-names'; Keaton, Chaplin, etc. in this set - but that's okay, as their films, fortunately, remain more or less complete to the present day. This DVD pays righteous tribute to the clowns wrongfully relegated to almost near obscurity by the general public, which is a shame, because their talents don't deserve to be forgotten.

I'm talking about Wallace Lupino, who along with his brother Lupino Lane, came from a long line of successful entertainers; Monte Collins, comedy writer and performer who graced the screen with his somewhat unconventional looks for over thirty years; Paul Parrott who was just as talented as his own brother Charley Chase (and nearly as often, overlooked); and...well, the list goes on and on. What makes these performers unique, however, is their ability to entertain us, and make us laugh. No mean feat in this world of ours.

The DVD presentation is first rate. The menu system rivals that of anything being released today by the major studios, and the film scores complement the visuals perfectly. Though the ravages of time have left their thumbprint on some of the film elements, the overall quality is very good, in some cases, exceptionally good.

If you like to laugh, buy this set. If you're interested in film history, buy this set. If you're looking for a great DVD bargain, buy this set. You will not be disappointed.

As for me, I'm hoping this is just the first volume of many. It may be a tough act to follow, but Accidentally Preserved, Volume 1 has wet my appetite for great things to come.",1370995200,20,2129,4.806010928961749
5767448,5,B00D2CRP42,"A lot of fun here, films you'll rarely see any other place - or NEVER see any other place. Thanks Ben!!",1370908800,7,103,3.9523809523809526
5767449,5,B00D2CRP42,"Sure, everyone's heard of Chaplin and Keaton, with most non-silent fans recognizing Lloyd. You're no novice, though. You know Langdon, Semon, Arbuckle, Lane, Sterling, Pollard, Chase, Turpin and even Hamilton. But have you ever heard of Wallace Lupino, Jack Lloyd, Monte Collins or Clyde Cook?
Ben Model has taken great care to make some of these actors' work available again, transferring a handful of shorts, giving them appropriate original scores, and putting them out on this new DVD set. I've only watched about a third of the films so far but they're all entertaining and the image quality is variable, sometimes even within the same film. The Lost Laugh, in particular, starts off kind of dubiously but after the first couple minutes gives way to a much clearer image, helping you appreciate the work that went into this set and how bad things could've been if these titles weren't saved when they were. Even being saved and transferred to safety stock, these films COULD have sat in reels, unseen and unused for the next century, but as Model says at his Silent Clowns and Cruel & Unusual Comedy screenings, film exhibition is film preservation.
This set is great for fans of comedy, silent films and film and history in general.
My one (minor) complaint is that there aren't more films in the set, as I know there are tons of silents in dire need of being saved and seen again, but I guess that's what Vol. 2 is for (and Vol. 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8...)",1370736000,3,1471,4.6183206106870225
5767450,4,B00D2CRP42,"""Accidentally Preserved"" is for a specialized taste; but if, like me, you enjoy rummaging through used book stores for the unusual and you enjoy old silent comedies, this is for you. To really appreciate the disk, you should look at the Kickstarter page (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/silentfilm/accidentally-preserved-rare-and-lost-silent-films), which tells the story behind the disc.

The quality of the movies is generally good; this isn't always a given with old silents, and I wondered how they'd be given that the material in this case came through irregular sources, but I was pleased. All but one of the selections are comedies. The personality most likely to be familiar is Koko the Clown, who was in a number of Betty Boop cartoons; here he's in an early Fleischer cartoon from the ""Out of the Inkwell"" series, appearing in some scenes superimposed on live action. If you've seen _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, you might be inclined to cry out, ""It's DIIIIIIIIIIP!!!"" at one point. My favorite selection, at least for the moment, is ""The Lost Laugh,"" a domestic comedy with a husband who manages to keep a sense of humor in spite of lots of things going wrong.

The one non-comedy is ""The House of Wonders,"" a film produced by the Elgin Watch Company that today would be called an infomercial. Even though its purpose is obvious, I learned quite a bit from it about how watches were made around 1930 and got a hint of how tedious factory work must have been then.

Ben Model's accompaniment is appropriate and unobtrusive.

This DVD isn't for everybody, but if you like discovering obscure old movies, I think you'll enjoy it.",1370304000,27,1639,5.014705882352941
5767451,4,B00D2CRP42,"The source material for this DVD-R (I wish it was a pressed DVD) is 16mm prints that were made for the home-use & rental market. Long before VHS made home movie collection a general trend, true film enthusiasts were collecting their favorites on actual SAFETY film. It started in the 1920's with 16mm Kodascopes from Kodak and 16mm & 9.5mm Pathescopes from Pathe, all printed on stable SAFETY film stock.  By 1930 this was the only market for silent films in the now sound dominated theatrical circuit.  These early home movie 16mm SAFETY film prints were often printed directly from the 35mm nitrate negatives, giving them an incredible sharpness for the 16mm format.

Undercrank Productions has given these crisp 16mm prints a Hi-Definition Digital Transfer (probably 2K but it does not specify), and the quality shows in the viewing! This is no cheap ""Alpha Video"" DVD, this is up there with the Kino DVDs. 90% of the time the contrast is perfect, there are a few over exposed shots that I suspect happened as an exposure error during the original printing of the 16mm film.  There will be negative scratches as the original 35mm nitrate negatives are showing their age in the 1930's when these 16mm prints were made.  Consider that those negatives seem to no longer exist, these 16mm reduction prints are the closest we will get to the original camera images.

No DNR was used to clean up the scratches but that is fine as in most cases they are not obtrusive.  When they are it is just a reminder as to how fragile the original negative was in just a few short years of production.  They had no duplicate printing negative in those days, the camera originals were used to make all prints until they wore out.

There is an ever so slight window-boxing to allow people who have their TVs set for over-scan (the factory pre-set) to see the entire picture uncropped.  Those who have their TVs properly set not to overscan will not be bothered by the sliver of black around the image.

***My favorite is Clyde Cook's ""The Misfit"", Clyde is channeling Buster Keaton in this under-rated film.***

Ben Model, the archiver of most of these rare prints, performs the soundtracks to perfection.

Why not 5 stars? Because these are the films that ran at theaters who could not book Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Chase, Laurel or Hardy.  That is not to say that they are bad, some are quite good.  But none of them equal the talents of mentioned masters of comedy.  The only familiar face you will see is that of Max Fleischer's cartoon star Koko the Clown, the only ""A"" picture here. Some others may look familiar, partly because they resemble their more famous brothers.  Paul Parrott bares a close resemblance to his brother who uses the stage name of Charley Chase.  Ida Lupino also looks like Lupino Lane.

Many of these were produced by the poverty-row studio Educational Pictures, an oddly named comedy producer who started out making educational films for schools but ended up making comedies.  Or the low-budget Cristie Comedies distributed by Paramount.

Most of these are ""one-reelers"" which run about 10 minutes. The only exception is the painfully boring industrial film ""The House Of Wonders"" which runs 23 minutes (I only made it through 10 minutes).  It is this industrial film that  prevents me from using the ""PLay All"" function of this DVD.  Your pleasure will be interrupted right in the middle for a 23 minute commercial.  There is the ""Next"" button on your remote to get past this should you choose the ""Play All"" function.  Another reason why I chose to pick & choose the play order is that there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the sequence of the films and I prefer to create my own sequence.

This release just makes you wish that the people who did the ""Cut To The Chase"" Charley Chase DVD had taken the same care to produce a quality image such as this!",1374192000,8,3869,4.68491124260355
5767452,5,B00D2CRP42,"If you're like me, on the lookout for the stuff that's off the beaten track and not readily available in art houses and museums, this DVD is perfect. It's a fascinating compilation of material. Not everything is a standout, but just the thought that these films have been saved and preserved means a lot. And Ben Model, one of the best accompanists around, whom I've had the pleasure of hearing at numerous live performances in NYC, has done a marvelous job of scoring each title. I was a Kickstarter backer of the DVD, and I'm so glad I had a small part in getting this made.",1373241600,2,576,4.443396226415095
5767453,5,B00D2CRP42,"Ben Model, superb composer of silent film scores and enthusiastic comedy historian shares rare films from his personal 16mm print collection on an impeccable disc.  This Undercrank Production highlights a few of the of mostly mustachioed, mostly middle aged men taking pratfalls for the hilarity of the Jazz Age public.  There are no A-listers here (unless you consider Charley Chase's brother Paul Parrott a star) but there are hardworking comedians occasionally reaching the height of inspired comic invention. The fascinating Elgin Watch Company industrial film ""The House of Wonders"" highlights complex watch making processes, and in its illumination of obsolete factory procedures obliterates all I thought I knew about a watch's interior. All those tiny screws fitting inside a thimble!  The surreal Koko the Clown animation is another unusual highlight.  Beautifully transferred, titled and scored, Accidentally Preserved is an excellent addition to any comprehensive silent film comedy DVD collection. On the next release, I'd love to see the one you showed at MoMA, with the baby and the alligator!",1373155200,2,1107,5.5325443786982245
5767454,5,B00D2CRP42,"If you're a silent comedy fan this DVD collection has everything you could want - rare titles, beautiful presentations, and excellent scores. Ben Model has done a fantastic job, and let's hope he follows this one up with many more!",1372982400,2,231,4.8
5767455,5,B00D2CRP42,"ACCIDENTALLY PRESERVED collects nine extremely rare films derived from 16mm prints (in some cases the only known surviving prints) originally made for the home movie market, representing an important film preservation effort. It also allows us to see some of the silent comedians whose work, while lesser known by casual film buffs, is still filled with wonderful comic invention. Highlights for me included THE LOST LAUGH (1928) with Wallace Lupino, and SHOOT STRAIGHT (1923), with Paul Parrott. There's also an interesting industrial film from circa 1931, THE HOUSE OF WONDERS, produced by the Elgin Watch Company. Ben Model both produced the disc as well as providing the music scores for all films included on it. Highly recommended for those interested in early film history and rare silent comedy.",1372118400,3,803,5.28125
5767456,5,B00D2CRP42,"I've been following Ben Model's work for about 5 years now. I've seen him play for such silent classics as ""The Black Pirate"", ""Wings"", and even ""The Birth of A Nation"", but this is by far, his most unique effort. It's always a treat to find something new, or at least something that wasn't previously known about until now. I personally prefer theater organ accompaniment when I watch a silent film, but his piano scores are always good. There was a great deal of passion that went into this set and it shows. I hope there are more volumes to come. Great job, Ben!",1372118400,3,565,4.4423076923076925
5767457,5,B00D2CRP42,"Though I love - and have reviewed many silent film releases such as those from Flicker Alley - I didn't know Ben Model (film archivist and silent film composer) until I covered the wonderful Ernie Kovacs DVD sets released in the last 2-3 years. Ben was involved in that project. Then I heard about this one and it's truly (as another reviewer said) ""a labor of love"".  None (I repeat, NONE) of these nine films has been released on home video before and most are from the only surviving copies. Model created title cards where the originals were destroyed or missing and corrected the film speed. 7 of these films are comedies, one is a cartoon - an ultra-rare Fleischer cartoon - and one is am ""industrial film"" for the Elgin watch company. Model provides the musical accompaniment.

These comedies are different from many others that I've seen in the fact that the ""title card"" are so tongue- in- cheek, that I was laughing at the cleverness. And I guess my favorite is ""Loose Change"" which shows how even silent films could be risque' before the ""Hays code"". The films are all about 10 minutes in length, except for the Elgin one that comes in at 23 minutes.

I received a screener copy so I can't describe the packaging but you can find five pages of detailed liner notes on Model's website ""Accidentally Preserved""
I'll leave it to the silent film experts who have posted reviews already to tell you more but I join them in looking forward to the next volume in what I hope is a series of releases.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5767458,5,B00D2CRP42,"So many films from the silent era survive only in 16mm prints made for the home rental market and some of these are incredibly rare, too. Rather than have these films sitting on a shelf, Ben Model has released nine shorts on this DVD for us all to enjoy, funded by a Kickstarter project. Crisply converted from 16mm to digital, there are seven silent comedies here, plus a film about the Elgin Watch Company and a Koko the Clown cartoon. The Elgin film is fascinating, but not something you'd want to watch very often. The Koko cartoon is very inventive. The 7 comedies are all worthwhile. Okay, the Wallace Lupino, Jack Duffy and Monte Collins shorts are fairly routine, but they all contain some good gags. The Paul Parrott, Clyde Cook, Cliff Bowes and Billy Franey entries are all excellent - I've seen a LOT of silent comedy, but these all contain highly original gags which had me laughing out loud. Some of the films here come from the only known copy, so some damage is inevitable, but everything is very watchable. Presentation is totally professional and the accompaniments on organ and piano are by Ben Model himself. As you would expect from one of the best silent film accompanists in the business, they are superb, supporting the films perfectly and never intruding. This DVD deserves the support of silent film enthusiasts everywhere - it's labelled Volume One, so hopefully there will be more rare gems from the enterprising Mr Model!",1371600000,,1449,4.776892430278885
5767459,5,B00D2CRP42,"This DVD (and since it's emblazoned ""Volume 1"" I'm taking it as a sign of future volumes to follow) is a true labor of love, and is a must-own item for anyone interested in silent comedy or film preservation...or both (I hope!).  Some of the material constitutes truly amazing finds--and one short in particular, WEDDING SLIPS (1928), is a textbook example of how these treasures need to preserved as quickly as possible...it almost didn't make the cut due to advanced decomposition.

Several of the comedies on the collection, in particular THE MISFIT (1924) and CHEER UP (1924), contain sprightly, funny gags as performed by funsters most deserving of a second glance.  The Out of the Inkwell short, MECHANICAL DOLL (1922), also demonstrates just how inventive silent films (in this case, a cartoon) could be.

Kudos to Ben Model and the other individuals who worked hard and demonstrate why they are well-regarded in their chosen field of silent film comedy history and preservation; I heartily recommend this disc!",1371427200,2,1018,5.077844311377246
5767460,5,B00D2CRP42,"It isn't often that one encounters a DVD release that succeeds on all levels, that manages to combine solid scholarship with pure enjoyment, but Ben Model's Accidentally Preserved does just that.

Funded through a successful Kickstarter campaign, Accidentally Preserved offers nine silent films that have survived by way of the 16mm home market, rather than through the preservation efforts of studio or not-for-profit film archives. Seven of the films are edited versions of 1920s slapstick comedies starring such unsung performers as Monte Collins, Paul Parrott, Clyde Cook and Billy Franey; the remaining two films are an early Koko the Clown animation and a two-reel documentary on the Elgin Watch Company. With minor exceptions, the films are in very good-to-excellent condition and provide the viewer with a fascinating look into the types of films ordinary audiences of the time would have seen on a regular basis in their local theaters, and not just the recognized classics of cinema. Aside from that, they are simply enormous fun to watch!

For a detailed discussion of the films themselves, I refer the reader to the Accidentally Preserved website (accidentallypreserved.com), where Steve Massa's solidly researched and well-written notes may be found. No need to duplicate his sterling efforts here.

Great credit must be given to Dino Everett, of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, for his clean, crisp HD mastering of the original 16mm elements, as well as to Marlene Weisman Abadi, for her imaginative logo and package design.

But, of course, the lion's share of honor must go to producer Ben Model, whose project this is. Ben has demonstrated great initiative in not only putting this project together, but in seeing it through to its happy conclusion -- a not inconsiderable feat, given the vagaries of the home market. As always, Ben's musical accompaniment is first-rate, appropriate to the films' pace and content, and a pleasure to listen to on its own merits. His menu design will be little noted by most viewers, but I found it to be elegant and easy to navigate -- a small triumph itself in these days of too-clever screen graphics.

So, congratulations to Ben and his team on a job well done! Buy this DVD now, not just for the simple pleasure of it, but to ensure that similar projects may soon see the light of day. Accidentally Preserved II, anyone?",1371427200,4,2377,5.038167938931298

If I must bring up anything negative, I thought the Elgin short was a bit boring after a while and would rather have had another rare comedy short instead.
But the chance to see a new Koko and Paul Parrott along with finally getting a look at Billy Franey was worth the price AND the 5 stars.

Image quality varies, but all have been reproduced as clearly as possible, and always with excellent contrast and, where missing, nicely reproduced credits and intertitles.  Viewers will differ on personal favorites, but my choices would be the Billy Franey short THE WATER PLUG (familiar gags, but well done), Clyde Cook's THE MISFIT (more familiar gags, again done well), and Paul Parrott's SHOOT STRAIGHT (seemingly the prototype for many Warners cartoons to follow).  The ""Out of the Inkwell"" Fleischer brothers cartoon MECHANICAL DOLL is utterly charming.  The Elgin Watch Company industrial THE HOUSE OF WONDERS, seemed like a curious inclusion, but turned out to be (for me, at least) fascinating viewing, and a sad reminder of our country's once formidable industrial might, long since parceled out to other countries.  This collection isn't for everyone, of course, so those of you with closed minds regarding silent and/or black-and-white films should probably think twice before purchasing.

Ben Model has assembled a collection of prints that may well be the only left in existence. High praise for the Paul Parrott, Clyde Cook, Jack Duffy, and Billy Franey shorts included here.
