8391356,5,B0038L0WF6,"An entertaining, insightful, and educational film of the background story of Pluto.  Tyson is a great host. This show works for all ages. My 10 y.o. has watched it more than 10 times over the past 5 years and she picks up something new each time.  I was really drawn in by the film as I've wondered why Pluto isn't a planet anymore.  I recommend this film for any age or group.  The video can be shown in school or at scouts etc.",1509667200,,429,4.132530120481928
8391357,5,B0038L0WF6,"Nova presents a humorous and yet very thorough discussion of why Pluto is no longer considered to be a planet.  Host Neil deGrasse Tyson covers the tale from all angles, beginning with the history of the planet's discovery, how the public fell in love with it, and how the controversy began and why it ended the way it did.  He talks with a lot of people, including the family of Pluto's discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, people from his hometown, scientists pro and con,and then there are all those letters and emails from the kids that want Pluto's planetary status back.

It's a wonderful presentation and good for the kids to see too.  It shows a slice of culture and a glimpse into scientific controversy told in an entertaining and educational way.

I rather like the category ""dwarf planet"", though the IAU insists that that isn't really a planet.  I disagree.  I like the definition of ""planet"" to include any body with enough gravity to form it into a spherical shape.  We now have 3 different categories of planets:  Jovian (gasbags like giant Jupiter), Terrestrial (rocky planets like Earth) and Dwarf Planets.  Each of them has something to contribute.  One of the objections to Pluto being a planet is the fact that there are moons that are larger; true enough, but consider the fact that Mars, and Earth as well, if put into orbit around Jupiter would be moons.  Jupiter easily has the gravity to hang onto us:  it has 318 times Earth's mass, and Earth has only 81 times the Moon's mass and we're hanging onto it pretty well so far.  As far as the ability to clear its neighborhood of all debris, I'd like to point out that Jupiter is not that far from some of the asteroids -- tiny Hilda is only about a hundred miles in diameter and comes within a little over an astronomical unit of Jupiter.  I don't hold that against Jupiter; it already has a weight problem and if we're going to get rid of asteroids, send them to Mars -- a little terraforming may not be such a bad thing.

The debate will continue but I think Pluto will certainly remain an important object, whatever they call it.

If you want more on the subject, I recommend Dr. Tyson's book ""The Pluto Files: The Rise & Fall of America's Favorite Planet"" (written for a general audience) and Mike Brown's ""How I Killed Pluto and Why it Had it Coming"" which is a little more advanced.  All are very good and this Nova episode is a great way to start the journey.",1439683200,,2430,4.521739130434782
