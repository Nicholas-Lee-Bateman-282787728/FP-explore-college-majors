5555923,1,B00B4ZN4D0,"Can anyone please explain why Ruff & Ready is not being released?
Why didn't Warner Brothers include Ruff & Ready in this set as planned?
Why, Why, WHY?
First we're told that 2 essential cartoons are not being released in the latest Tom & Jerry DVD set and now Ruff & Ready.
Is Ruff having a fight with Ready over royalties?
WHAT'S GOING ON.........?

5555924,2,B00B4ZN4D0,"This will be the final time I pre-order ANYTHING from Warner Brothers.  My reason for purchasing this set for some of the previously unreleased shows-such as ""The Cattanooga Cats"" & ""Abbot & Costello"".

One plus is that most have Original title and credit sequences in tact. The early ones don't have sponsor references.

So if you were after any of those specifically, stay away-they're not on here.

You'd think that maybe I was just shipped a package with one disc missing-but the packaging only holds 2 discs.

5555925,2,B00B4ZN4D0,Ruff and Ready was my favorite show as a kid. Most of the other cartoons I already have in other sets. I'm very disappointed that Ruff and Ready didn't make it. I'd purchase the whole series if it ever came out.,1369094400,9,211,4.170731707317073
5555926,4,B00B4ZN4D0,"I believe that the intent of this collection was to present a chronological history of Hanna-Barbera's TV-output from 1957 through around 1966, when it kind of goes off the rails.  True, Hokey Wolf actually should be down with the YOGI BEAR SHOW segments since it took the place of the YOGI cartoons on HUCKLEBERRY HOUND in 1961, but apart from that everything is representative of the order of release of the H-B series (and the one theatrical cartoon series, LOOPY DE LOOP) through the 1966 shows.  Skipped for 1966 are the second season of SINBAD JR. (following Trans-Artists' first season) and the LAUREL & HARDY cartoons (neither owned by Warner), sad omissions because Sinbad was voiced by Tim Matheson (of JONNY QUEST) and his parrot Salty was played by Mel Blanc, while Laurel and Hardy bore more than a little resemblence to the ABBOTT AND COSTELLO cartoons from the next year. Then in 1967, missing are the YOUNG SAMSON & GOLIATH episodes paired in syndication with SPACE KIDETTES, both segments from MOBY DICK and THE MIGHTY MIGHTOR, FANATSTIC FOUR (Marvel, now owned by Disney), and SHAZZAN.  1968 series that were skipped were the animated segments from BANANA SPLITS ADVENTURE HOUR (as the backlash against super-heroes caused most new H-B series to be derived from literary classics): ARABIAN KNIGHTS, THREE MUSKETEERS and MICRO-VENTURE), THE ADVENTURES OF GULLIVER, WACKY RACES, and the semi-animated NEW ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN.  Other than CATTANOOGA CATS (which is only partially represented in the set, missing the AROUND THE WORLD IN 79 DAYS cartoon), 1969's other missing series are PERILS OF PENELOPE PITSTOP, DASTARDLY AND MUTTLEY IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES, and that little-known series, SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU?  Three 1970 series are skipped to take in FUNKY PHANTOM here, and then another 27 to include 1976's JABBERJAW, neither of which seem terribly pertinent to this collection.

  That said, this compilation does include plenty of segments new to DVD (since the season sets for them have yet to appear), including RUFF & REDDY, QUICK DRAW McGRAW, SUPER SNOOPER & BLABBER MOUSE, AUGIE DOGGIE & DOGGIE DADDY, LOOPY DE LOOP, WALLY GATOR, TOUCHE TURTLE & DUM-DUM, LIPPY THE LION & HARDY HAR-HAR, PETER POTAMUS & SO-SO, BREEZLY BRUIN & SNEEZLY SEAL, YIPPEE, YAPPEE & YAHOOEY, ATOM ANT, SQUIDDLY DIDDLEY, PRECIOUS PUPP, SECRET SQUIRREL, HILLBILLY BEARS, WINSOME WITCH, ABBOTT & COSTELLO, CATTANOOGA CATS, IT'S THE WOLF, MOTORMOUSE & AUTOCAT, FUNKY PHANTOM and JABBERJAW.  (Without looking, I'm not sure if any of the HUCKLEBERRY HOUND segments are from the unreleased second season or not.)

  Arguably, the CATTANOOGA CATS segments that were included have more in common with the earlier H-B style than anything from the '70s (funny animals in 5 to 7-minute segments) but apart from the series Warner Bros. doesn't own, SAMSON & GOLIATH, MOBY DICK, MIGHTY MIGHTOR and SHAZZAN (plus, perhaps, MICRO-VENTURE) would have made a more representative progression of the studio's output.  Had I been in charge, I'd have included the first four of the aforementioned ""super-hero""-type segments here plus the rarely seen hour special, ALICE IN WONDERLAND (OR, WHAT'S A NICE GIRL LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?) from 1966, which would make this a must-buy instead of just something nice to have.  Another possibility would have been the H-B version of Mexico's CANTINFLAS series (circa '65-'67, or later; experts differ) which aired in English as AMIGO & FRIENDS with narration from John Stephenson, but the segments I've seen look a bit more recent (circa '72) so I'm not certain that they fit the era.

  My assumption is that this will be quickly followed by another 25-cartoon sampler covering the late '60s and early '70s (obviously built around SCOOBY-DOO).  I suppose they might go back to include the missing four cartoons from '67, but most of the 1968-forward series share character design by Iwao Takamoto, and thus look a lot different from the earlier Ed Benedict/Jerry Eisenberg/Doug Wildey/Alex Toth-designed first decade, so it's a shame they made the content-decisions they made.  And of course, with most later cartoons lasting a full half-hour each, it could be difficult to wedge 25 of them onto the same number of discs.  Since the series which would appear on that one don't interest me terribly much, that's someone else's problem.",1365811200,6,4378,5.1308016877637135

One of the great things about these DVDs is that they set it up so that there would not be two or more continuous episodes of the the same cartoon. In addition, they are beloved and non-mainstream cartoons ( i.e., Peter Potamus  amd Adam Ant instead of 15 episodes of the Flintsones).My greatest joy in owning these cartoons is that my children will know what true cartoons were like instead of the Japanese imports and knock-offs on TV now that are being fed to them .HB needs to come out with an 80's Saturday morning version ( expand on the current existing one) as most of these are from the 60s and 70s.",1378512000,5,692,4.448818897637795

5555949,4,B00B4ZN4D0,"Warner Home Video just recently released this commemorative anniversary DVD collection, Best of Warner Bros. 25 Cartoon Collection: Hanna-Barbera. Any collection that claims to be the ""best of"" is just like one of those magazine or Internet ""all-time best"" lists. Fans have made their opinions about this collection known elsewhere on the net. No one is going to be completely happy with the selections and they will point out what should or should not be included.

Apparently there were cartoons announced for this set that did make it to the final release. Huckleberry Hound and Yakky Doodle appear on the package but are not represented with episodes. The box does not list the cartoons, making me wonder whether the package had to go to press before the final selections were made. (Because I love these cartoons and I'm nice, I have listed them in detail below.)

My guess is that there were lists of cartoons that might have made the final cut but were eliminated for one reason or another. Thanks to Stu's Show, I know that Capitol and other production music is challenging to license, so you will only see and hear one cartoon with non-HB library music--the first one on the set.

Another consideration is the disparity between what was acceptable in the `60s and the social mores of today. This is a mainstream WB release and does not have a ""for collectors"" disclaimer. Could a young parent sit their kids down to watch this and be assured that there wouldn't be anything that is considered unacceptable?

Let me quote Tami Horiuchi, amazon.com's in-house reviewer, about the first ""Saturday Morning Cartoons"" DVD set: ""While these cartoons are great fun for the adult set, it's interesting that what was considered kids' entertainment from 1961 to 1968 is now deemed unsuitable for children due to things like excessive cartoon violence, dishonesty, animal cruelty, and sexist and chauvinistic behavior.""

Thus, this collection includes an early Flintstones episode in which Fred is jealous but not the ""caveman"" he is in other early shows, Top Cat and the gang at their most warmhearted as they care for a lost baby and so on. There is some violence, gunplay and stereotyping--but you can tell after watching the entire set that a lot of thought went into selecting the cartoons, whether you agree with the choices or not. Which cartoons would appeal to the greatest number of people in 2013, especially those to whom HB cartoons are not as familiar as they are to those of us who grew up adoring them?

Then, there are today's kids, used to explosive theatrical tent-pole movies and more edgy, rapid-fire cartoons on cable. The choices in this set contain space ships, aliens, funny animals, fairy tale characters, giant monsters and ghosts--the sort of thing that plays well to kids today as well as yesterday. I'd like to think that the kids who watch this set would come away with a desire to see more of this stuff.

So I'm not being an apologist so much as a realist. There are some Hanna-Barbera landmarks here (the debuts of several characters, premiere episodes, etc.). 11 of the 25 cartoons, as far as I can tell, are new to DVD. It's not a definitive collection by any means, but I'm glad I bought it.

5555951,3,B00B4ZN4D0,"Let me start out by saying I don't watch HBO or most current shows. It will become clear why I say this. The people at Warner Archive, however, likely do watch HBO, and it's their idea of what TV ought to be. Therefore, WB packages HBO's shows in lavish DVD sets with lots of extras. But they are convinced that the demographics for say, ""classic"" Hanna-Barbera cartoons and old TV shows belong to the lowest price points and are not worth bothering with.

But, thinks Warner Bros, let's throw them a bone. After all, old TV shows launched Nick at Nite, and are the staple of the roaringly successful ME TV free TV, so much so that people are taking back their Comcast boxes and putting up aerials for this one channel. And both USA and Cartoon Network garnered a large and faithful audience whenever they showed HB shows. So the demographic is wrong, and we ought to put these out on DVD (DVD being as old school as the classic cartoon audience). But the Golden Collection DVD sets didn't sell all that well. Never mind that they were almost never in stores, received no advertising support, and some of the best shows never came out in the series. We need a less risky approach that cuts costs (read ""quality""). Enter Warner Archives.

That ancient-sounding name must herald, thinks the reader, the sort of attention to quality that attends Disney Archive DVDs. Think of all the extras HB cartoon discs could hold. A cornucopia of cartoon creativity. But alas, it was not to be. The people at Warner Archive are too busy watching HBO to care about HB. But they did throw us this bone.

But you'd have a sense of deja vu when you got to these cartoons:

Disc one opens with three cartoons from the Quick Draw McGraw Show: ""Dynamite Fright"" (Quick Draw); ""Outer Space Case"" (Snooper and Blabber); ""Growing Growing Gone"" (Augie Doggie).  Great' toons, but where have you seen them before? All three appear on Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s, Vol. 1. There's another episode of Quick Draw: ""Mark of El Kabong"" (Quick Draw); ""Party Pooper Pop"" (Augie Doggie); ""Chilly Chiller"" (Snooper and Blabber). This appeared on SMC 1960s, Vol. 2. The Jetsons' episode is unaccountably ""Rosey the Robot"", which was the pilot and appeared on SMC 1960s, vol. 1. Why, when HB/ WB has released the entire first season of The Jetsons on DVD?

Disc two includes ""The Shocking Electrical Monster"" (Frankenstein Jr.) and ""The Spinner"" (The Impossibles), as well as ""The Heat Thing"" (Space Ghost), all three from SMC 1960s, Vol. 1. From the Peter Potamus Show we get ""Black Bart"", which appeared on SMC 1960s, Vol 2.

The special features are ""Here Comes a Star"" a black and white pre-launch special for The Magilla Gorilla Show, with plugs for its sponsor, Ideal Toys. The trailers are ads for ""More Scooby Doo!"" and a very violent montage of Tom and Jerry.

Slim pickins, Cartoon Fans. What can Warner Archives do? Apparently the giant studio, despite the opening trailer celebrating its 90th anniversary, lacks the clout to collect cartoons. Like all the other cartoon studios, they could simply release their DVDs through Disney's Buena Vista Distribution, which seems to have no problem getting in stores and attracting attention. Then, of course, they could simply hire people who love cartoons and those others can go and work at HBO or whatever they think is the current epitome of pay TV. Just to skew the demographic, I merely note that I won't be watching or buying any HBO shows, but I will be looking for HB DVDs if WB takes the time to put out some good ones.",1371254400,14,4386,5.4208211143695015
5555952,1,B00B4ZN4D0,"I wish I could say this set was the GREAT thing I thought it was going to be BUT someone goofed!  It is a cheap set missing much of the promised content when it was first announced?  I am glad to finally have an ABBOTT & COSTELLO cartoon!  Maybe they will issue the whole series...it is long overdue BUT what happened to the rest of this set?  I have a feeling WB is going to say...it didn't sell, people must not want the old H-B cartoons BUT what we don't want, is people putting these sets together that know nothing about what H-B fans want to see.  A true historian needs to oversee these releases and then things won't get botched, like this set.",1369958400,6,652,4.225806451612903
5555953,1,B00B4ZN4D0,"I pre-ordered this set when it was first listed....AWFUL!  Was really looking forward to RUFF 'N' REDDY !  Shame on WARNER BROS.  I know people that work there and they say the people who are doing these sets, have no clue as to what they are handling and it shows.  Remember THE MAGILLA GORILLA SHOW set?  They left the show titles beginning/end off the set??  Why can't WB treat HANNA-BARBERA with class?  Why don't they hire people that know what they are doing?  I guess they just don't care.  Hopefully, they will release HANNA-BARBERA'S THE ABBOTT & COSTELLO SHOW series...the only RARE cartoon of value on this entire set.",1369699200,15,629,4.697247706422019
5555954,1,B00B4ZN4D0,"How dare Warner Home Video had to mess up this DVD release!

Since Warner has done it again with content changes, avoid getting this at all times! Stick with the Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection on Warner Archive since they mostly release new-to-DVD shows on complete sets.",1369699200,57,2565,4.8919540229885055
5555955,1,B00B4ZN4D0,Very disappointed!!!  Many of the episodes I wanted to see (especially Ruff and Ready) were not on the discs.  Misleading advertising!,1369526400,7,134,5.333333333333333
5555956,1,B00B4ZN4D0,"I was very disappointed when I purchased this set yesterday and noticed that several cartoons were missing from the ones mentioned in Warner Bros's press release. Not very much effort and heart was placed into this compilation from Warner Bros. Hanna-Barbera deserves better than this!!! How can they release an H-B compilation without including their best shows from the 1970s, which was their busiest and most productive decade of work!!! I was also looking forward to seeing the planned episodes of Motormouse & Autocat, It's the Wolf, as well as Funky Phantom and Jabberjaw, which are nowhere to be found on this set. I hate the people at Warner Bros!!!! They have absolutely NO RESPECT for their customers and NO RESPECT for the classics!!! So what else is new?",1369353600,27,766,4.945736434108527
5555957,1,B00B4ZN4D0,"I am very disappointed in the recent release BEST OF WARNER BROS.: HANNA-BARBERA that came out this week. When the set was first announced, we were told that it would have Ruff and Reddy, Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Pixie & Dixie, Yakky Doodle, Lippy the Lion and Wally Gator plus other great H-B cartoons. None of these characters showed up on the set. There are two Quick Draw cartoons, two Augie Doggie cartoons, two Super Snooper cartoons, two Hokey Wolfs but no Huck and Yogi!!!! Huck and Yogi are even on the cover of the set and they are not included at all in the cartoons. The Yogi Bear theme song is there attached to a Snagglepuss cartoon but no Yogi Bear cartoon itself. Huck is my all-time favorite and he is not there. I tried to take the DVD back to Target but they wouldn't take it back because it had been opened. This is false advertising and I am really mad that I wasted my money on this set when it didn't turn out to be what it was supposed to be.",1369267200,88,971,4.282608695652174

8562558,2,B00B4ZN4D0,"I loved watching these old cartoons on boomerang but they stopped showing them so when I saw this set I thought it would  be a nice sampler of all those cartoons and some new ones Id never seen. However I was disappointed in the fact that it isn't The full episodes, its just the short cartoons. For example with the magical gorilla one we get the 5 min cartoon with him but not the whole 22min or so show that also had the other cartoon characters in it which is what upsets me. For $20 this isn't worth it. Its missing so many things. I don't see why they couldn't just do the full episodes.",1529107200,,593,4.156521739130435
8562559,1,B00B4ZN4D0,"Yeah, this must have been dredged up from the bottom of the barrel. As one reviewer aptly wrote, there's not even a Yogi Bear or Huckleberry Hound!  Come on!  They've got Looney Tunes remastered and beautiful from the 30's & 40's that are nice and clear-these are in horrible condition.  It almost looks like someone just randomly went through their junk files and this is the result. Why not give the customer what they want- nice clear remastered renditions of Yogi, Huckleberry, et. al. and do it right. This is just an insult!",1508371200,6,530,4.67741935483871

8562561,5,B00B4ZN4D0,"BEST OF WARNER BROS. 25 CARTOON COLLECTION: HANNA-BARBERA: Although this double disc DVD set offers fourteen toons that have been released on other collections, that still means that fans get eleven not previously available anywhere, including a pair from Hokey Wolf (an animated Sgt. Bilko), a Loopy De Loop (another lupine character, this one with a French accent), and the short lived ink and paint version of Abbott & Costello. Action adventure heroes Jonny Quest and Space Ghost make welcome appearances, contrasting sharply with the kooky critter routines of Snagglepuss, Augie Doggie and Peter Potamus. In a change of pace, Magilla Gorilla offers a music video (Makin' with the Magilla, sung by Little Eva) during its ""back to the beach"" story, and The Hillbilly Bears showcases incomprehensible mumbler Paw Rugg as an unlikely rock star pursued by screaming females. It's a cereal bowl full of nostalgic fun to revisit obscure faves like robot do-gooder Frankenstein Jr., rockers turned supermen The Impossibles, and sawed off swashbuckler Touche Turtle, not to mention the much better known Quick Draw McGraw's Zorro-like alter ego El Kabong. There's no Yogi Bear or Huckleberry Hound here (even though they are pictured on the box)...but with Top Cat, The Flintstones and The Jetsons all on board, there's little for a die hard toonhead to complain about.
