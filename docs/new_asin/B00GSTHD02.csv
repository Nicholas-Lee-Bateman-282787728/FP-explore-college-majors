6108906,4,B00GSTHD02,"I didn't originally write a review of this film because there were so many other good reviews.  The film was a good, empowering, entertaining, inspiring story about a young man who overcame what would normally be insurmountable odds to resume doing what he loved to do despite many discouraging events in his life.  Often, films like this are about someone who achieves the impossible as far as accomplishment.  Here, the effort is as great as in any of these films; but the results, because of the decisions of others, are more realistic.  It shows that though our effort may be to get ourselves where we want to be may be outstandingly successful, the decisions of others may limit the application of our success.  This does not, as it shows here, reduce the greatness of our efforts; but may fall short of our accomplishment goals.  This is an inspiring family movie and I highly recommend its viewing.",1438646400,,905,4.769230769230769
6108907,5,B00GSTHD02,"This is based on a true story.  I caught the movie on BYUTV and purchased the DVD afterwards.

6108971,3,B00GSTHD02,"This is a true to life story that could have been 5 stars.  What went wrong?  The ending is what went wrong.  Cory scores one of two free throws in the final seconds of a runaway win over a visiting team.  The free throws were a result of a giveaway foul by an opposing player. The plot ending was predictable when it became obvious in the middle of the picture that he would not make a full recovery.  This was similar to the movie Rudy except Rudy's contribution to his team was far more significant than Cory's to his team.  Cory handing out towels and bottles of water did not seem like a convincingly big contribution to his team.  Beau Bridges was disappointing as the coach.  He delivered his lines as if he didn't care.  Cory's visit to a small boy that had a similar stroke was one great big cliche.  I just didn't buy in to the fact that making one free throw made a good ending.  Think about the movie ""Remember the Titans"".  Star defensive player Gary Bertier becomes paralyzed.  He never recovered but with a few well written lines he motivated his team.  A narration at the end of the movie said that he went on to play handicaps sports.  This movie doesn't tell you anything significant accomplishments Cory did after he graduated.",1436659200,,1246,4.451327433628318

Unsure whether to recommend for teens who have their lives ahead of them with a great future envisioned with perfect health. I always want to warn these kids of all the dangers and how fast they will grow up and think this is the best time of their lives and so on. However, why bring them down and make them worry any more than they have to? I totter on the line between providing wisdom and letting them find their own way. However, a film like this that demonstrates such a strong will to overcome great challenges both mental and physical is tough to ignore.

I was surprised they included the beautiful sweet girlfriend who abandoned him even before he had a chance to demonstrate his rapid recovery. Bullet dodged but how this girl would be hated if she actually existed in real life. The extent of the lessons learned appeared to be very realistic and the ending was appropriate. Looks like when a big part of you dies another stronger, deeper, emotionally connected you emerges. Great perspective and provides insights for seeking outside professional help to enhance recovery.

High recommend for anyone who knows others experiencing a loss of a former life, how to resort to gratitude for inspiration and overall a wonderful transformation of a tragic event.",1434672000,2,1310,4.787610619469026

This isn't a happily ever after movie, even though it has a happy ending; this young man recovers, but he'll never be the same as he was before the accident--he's a better person.  It is far more believable than many of these ""based on a true story"" movies.  I don't yet have a copy of my own, but I intend to buy one.  There's a reason why you don't find cheap copies of this on eBay.  It's an EXCELLENT movie.",1429747200,,584,4.263636363636364

I had to do this without my husband who died six months before my first operation.  Didn't know I had it in me for I certainly couldn't have imagined being brave without him beside me.  When Cory's first girl friend didn't like the person she had become who couldn't stand beside him and so she dumped him, I was so impressed with his determination in spite of this loss.",1428969600,5,678,4.608333333333333

That internal drive is what pushed his recovery, a remarkable one considering his age at the time of the stroke.

But this movie is a really touching story about a Gettysburg college boy/man overcoming a tremendous unexpected tragedy and working hard to recover. In a world where mediocrity is celebrated I think we really need more real life stories of people who won't settle from average and work hard to do things that others tell them they can't do. Jean Louisa Kelly, Luke Kleintank, Beau Bridges,and of course David Henry and all of the other fantastic actors really put their heart into portraying this story and I know that the directors and producers wanted the story to really reflect the real life events. I saw them talking to Cory and his family during every scene and they were there watching it all happen. And we met Cory and his family and they were very kind people that really make you think about the fact that bad things can happen to anyone and how wonderful it is that they made it through their hardship and came out on top.
