8417714,5,B004749LOQ,"What was left off Drive In Delirium the first volume, you'll more than likely find it here on the Offspring Volume 2.
Great collection of 70's-80's drive-in trailers are fun and at the same time disturbing to watch as you see just what we were watching on our theater screens, from foreign horror to sex films.
I found this set a real curiosity and a worthy addition to my trailer collection.
Like the first set you get another 12 hours of trailers on a 4 disc set.
So if you buy this one with the first set you'll have 24 hours of the good, the bad and the downright offensive.
Warning:
These trailer sets are in no way for viewing by those easily offended as they contain, horror, nudity, bad language and just about every other extreme.

Please Note: This review refers to the Australian set using the same title.",1304899200,,816,4.44
