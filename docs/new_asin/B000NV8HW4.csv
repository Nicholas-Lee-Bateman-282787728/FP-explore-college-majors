 For instance in the timeline I learned a new trick and using macros, and even though there are a few new Compositing App's out there today doesn't make Apple Shake obsolete it is still very powerful and widely used by professionals and newcomers to the Entertainment Industry alike.

 Besides he has been featured in Cinefex Magazine, how can you not be good and be featured in Cinefex Magazine? Overall I liked it and will keep it in my library of Reference, after all an Artist can never have enough reference can they?",1212883200,,711,4.488372093023256
