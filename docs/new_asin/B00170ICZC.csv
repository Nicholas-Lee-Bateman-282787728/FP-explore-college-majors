3165875,4,B00170ICZC,"Here are two really entertaining films from the golden age of gladiator movies. Fury of Hercules stars the physically impressive Brad Harris as the ""son of Zeus"".The script has him joining a group of rebels to liberate a nation from the tyranny of a corrupt ruler. He gets to put his physique to good use wrestling a lion and a man in quite possibly the worst gorilla costume ever seen. Future screen Hercules,Alan Steel plays a villian in this one and he and Harris have two memorable throwdowns in this flick. Vulcan,Son of Jupiter stars Rod Flash Ilush in the title role. This film features more fantasy elements than most movies to be found in this genre and less pure bicep-bending action. The story revolves around the obsession of both gods and men for Venus,who in this film comes across as the Paris Hilton of Olympus. Also included in the film's cast are genre regulars Gordon Mitchell,Bella Cortez and Roger Browne. There is one downside to this disc. The second movie in this package is pretty washed out.",1245974400,,1017,4.719101123595506

8264391,4,B00170ICZC,"In THE FURY OF HERCULES, it's time for Brad Harris to lift, grunt, and toss other grown men like so much pizza dough, as the title human boxcar!  This time out, he saves a queen from a pirouetting pair of ballet assassins! Grateful, the queen takes Hercules into her private chambers, and into her confidence. He soon discovers that she is a tyrannical bossy-boots, enslaving the populace. If she weren't bad enough, her conniving underlings are even worse! Now, wearing a cream colored one-piece / one-shoulder mini-dress for spring, Hercules must free the slaves, but first, he must prove himself through a series of trials. He must battle a lion, and a ratty looking, rather sickly go-rilla, before entering a cage match to the death w/ another muscle man! Soon, our gargantuan hero is moving five-ton slabs of stone, on his way to deliver the downtrodden, all while wearing the latest in red, beach cover-ups! Oh no! A band of marauding, hillbilly cavemen has shown up, making murderous mischief! Can Hercules settle the score? Yes, he goes berserk-ules! Huzzah! Watch at once!...",1500249600,,1084,4.956043956043956

8264398,4,B00170ICZC,I liked the movie. I was concerned because I've never heard of Brad Harris and I wondered if he could pull off playing the role of Hercules. I was pleasantly surprised that he played an excellent role. I would say very close to the inimitable Steve Reeves. The story was typical of the sword and sandal genre and I enjoyed watching it.,1412208000,2,335,4.419354838709677
