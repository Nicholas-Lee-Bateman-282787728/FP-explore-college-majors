One day, their long time friend who is not American citizen but was raised in America is deported to Mexico.  Bored and willing to help out their buddy, two friends find a way to smuggle him back to US (Arizona).  Before long, they have a busines plan on creating a new way of trafficking Mexicans to US - at a profit.

It turns out to be an easy and successful venture, that pays well and pays in cash.  Both men feel they are doing a public service by providing a more humane way of transporting people in the US.  Until one day they realize tht Mexican warlord is unhappy about loosing his business to Gringos.  And that is when the real trouble starts...

Great story, not so good actors and wonderful entertainment.",1243209600,4,948,4.535294117647059
3771280,4,B001QWQJ3I,"A genuinely good film. For the ultra-low budget, the look is commendable. These guys prove that you don't need a huge budget and stars to make a really good movie. You need a well written script and a great story! A couple of ""gasp!"" moments with some clever twists make this film one of the better indie films I've seen in awhile. As a fellow filmmaker, I'm tracking these guys down to find out how they pulled it off.",1242432000,3,419,4.3164556962025316
3771281,4,B001QWQJ3I,Coyote is a movie about 2 guys who start out with a good-hearted reason to help immigrants cross the border but then become greedy.  Surprise ending!,1239667200,3,149,4.730769230769231
3771282,5,B001QWQJ3I,"Set against the beauty of the Sonoran desert, the film depicts two men who hatch a plan that they think will both help immigrants and make them rich.  The film touches on the complexity of immigration but balances it out with the timeless story of men seeking happiness and satisfaction.

Twists and turns in the story were fun and left me guessing until the end.  The cinematography was very beautiful and uniquely captured the stark desert landscape, giving the film a look that was much more polished than most indie films I've seen.  The acting was very naturalistic, a nice counterbalance to the stereotypical portrayals in many mainstream films.  This a great film--highly recommended for a movie night at home!",1237939200,8,717,4.941666666666666
3771283,4,B001QWQJ3I,"What a well-written and thought-out story.  Coyote is an independent film that doesn't look low budget.  It deals with a real and timely subject (human smuggling) without being preachy.  If you're looking for a film with a political statement, this isn't it.  This is a story with a soul.  It's funny, sincere, and tense and frenetic as the story builds.",1237852800,6,354,4.833333333333333

8336696,4,B001QWQJ3I,"i have learned to not judge a movie by its cover. for when i picked this one up at my nearby library and examined it, i had never heard of it nor its actors and anyone else listed on the back. still, i was intrigued enough and thought i was getting a relaxing, silly little indie film with a synopsis that said ""kinder, gentler people smugglers"". I was way off....

Coyote drew me in right away. the cinematography was quite good, and as i lived for about a year in tucson, it made me deeply miss the lush beauty of the sonoran desert. the story,,though a bit implausible, is none the less quite captivating, the budget film effect moments work quite well as they are interspersed throughout the film to capture emotionally interesting scenes and contrast quite well with the sweeping panoramas of this harsh, beautiful country.

the acting overall was good though director brian peterson could have taken a few more acting lessons in his leading role. one cannot always wear many hats equally well.

this is an excellent film overall, a welcome respite from the hollywood hit factory. it inspires me to take more risks on unknown films. more folks should know about these hidden gems!",1451520000,,1185,4.6875

8336699,2,B001QWQJ3I,This movie had me scratching my head.  It was all over the place and never really understood why the characters did what they did.  I wouldn't recommend it.,1395273600,,156,4.535714285714286
8336700,4,B001QWQJ3I,I really liked the movie but it should not be listed as a comedy.  There are funny aspects but there were some funny scenes in Blackhawk Down too and that was no comedy.,1393804800,,169,4.121212121212121
8336701,3,B001QWQJ3I,"This is the type of student film that you make with your friends from the dorm. Despite that, the production values are good considering the lack of money that they most likely had to work with. Also, the desert itself plays a beautiful part in the whole of the project as with ""Breaking Bad."" It tries to be campy going for the ""Cult Classic"" market with all kinds of stilted dialogue, woodenly delivered by ugly actors -- worse than you can believe without seeing it which I wish I had NOT!",1385683200,,492,4.417582417582418
8336702,5,B001QWQJ3I,Hands down one of the best cinematic masterpieces ever made.  It kept me interested from the first moment I delved into the film. Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie from start to finish especially if you are one that is keen on border movies.,1332892800,,255,4.425531914893617
8336703,5,B001QWQJ3I,This movie is unique and will have you at the edge of your seat.  I have shared my copy with several friends and they all loved it.  Brett Spackman is awesome and we look forward to many more movies from him in the future.,1273536000,,222,4.0227272727272725
8336704,5,B001QWQJ3I,"I was so surprised by this film. What a great story! I think it's a must see; a shame it didn't make it to the theater. This will keep you guessing, laughing, crying and on the edge of your seat!",1254096000,,195,3.9
