2062175,5,B00024I3GC,"Asian cinema keeps getting better and I give this movie five stars.  Compared to ""Point of no return"" influenced by the original ""La Femme Nikita"".  Beyond Hypothermia captures the gritty French noir look and feel that ""Point of no return"" couldn't.  By no means is ""Beyond Hypothermia"" a remake of La femme Nikita but it takes the same plot of the lonely female assasin being burnt out on the job then falls for a man that knows nothing about her and this puts everything in jepordy.  What makes this one interesting is the fact that it was shot in a country that has a different spin on it's culture towards women, which would probably explain why this fully independent soldier would fall for a simple modest noodle maker.  The action is top notch as well as the cinematography and the story skips her beginnings (unlike La Femme Nikita) giving her character a more mysteious quality about her.",1167609600,4,897,4.687898089171974

2062177,5,B00024I3GC,"Although the plot of this movie is very familiar
(a lone female assassin finally starts to feel
true emotions when she meets a ""normal"" guy
and then decides that she wants to leave the business)
""Beyond Hypothermia"" sets a high standard for
run-of-the-mill assassin films.  There is a
superb balance between drama and action in
this movie. The dramatic portions never come
across as forced, poorly written melodrama.
The action scenes appear to be even,fluid extensions
of the drama. The cinematography is Oscar quality,
in my opinion. At every turn, there are unique little
elements that grab the eye and hold your attention like something you may seen a
million times but all of a sudden it strikes you as brand new.

This movie was smartly designed and written.
The ending is a pain parade, and that's putting
it lightly. It's extremely violent, but surprisingly, not
saddening. In fact, it's almost refreshing because,
in a way, everyone got exactly what they were
seeking. You'll have to watch the movie to
fully appreciate how this is so.",1119398400,7,1044,4.926136363636363
2062178,3,B00024I3GC,"Beyond Hypothermia is the story of dainty looking hitwoman. She's never led a normal life and is characterized by both her ice cold nerves and a perfect assassin's body that is colder than normal.

And then one day she meets a guy. A regular guy who's not handsome or rich or powerful but is sweet and funny and good. And he owns a noodle shop. He loves her, wants to get her out of her deadly life and is willing to leave his home and business to be with her. He's a regular guy but when his beloved is in trouble he rises to heroism. The audience really comes to like him. This is her one big chance to live happily ever after and she decides to take it.

But of course there's a problem. A bodygaurd who was hired to protect her last hit is after her. He's so implacable about doing his job that he doesn't even spare his father-in-law when it turns out the old man was the one who ordered the hit. Even the death of his wife doesn't slow this dude down. He won't stop tyring to get our heroine and he has the resources of an entire gang to back him up.

The ending of this movie is extremely bloody, violent and surprisingly touching in the way that only a movie made in Korea, Japan or Hong Kong can be. It's very, very good.",1117843200,2,1230,4.116666666666666
2062179,3,B00024I3GC,"I believe this is a Hong Kong/Korean movie but I could be wrong as I didn't properly pay attention to credits.

It's a story about a female assasin who fell in love with a guy who cooked noodles for a living... sort of like La Femme Nikita with an Asian actress and without all the sheen and polish.

Anyhow, what I like about this movie is that it's an okay foreign movie [we don't have to limit ourselves to crappy Hollywood, do we?] Also, the acting in the movie is good enough. The film has a dark and gloomy tone, which I like. Warning: just like many actions, this one has leaky plots and you might want to suspend your sense of disbelief while watching it.

To sum it up, if you need a break from cheap Hollywood actions, go for it. It's not that great but it's not exactly a pain to watch either.",1116028800,,804,4.174193548387096
2062180,4,B00024I3GC,"Beautiful Chien-lien Wu stars in this action-packed movie. A very simple story about a killer who's body heat level is below that of the normal human, this movie is worth seeing for the performance of the main actress.

Chien-Lien shows considerable talent in a difficult role where she must restrain all emotions only to reveal herself at the end where her character discovers empathy and thrust with the help of a man who loves her.

Apart from that, this movie is essentialy a succession of action scenes with spectacular sequences and great artistic direction.",1092355200,4,564,4.98936170212766

8022034,5,B00024I3GC,"This is a superb movie! The action scenes are violent, graphic and REALISTIC. Yes, hurray for cool action sequences that are actually Solidly Realistic!!

Beyond Hypothermia has a good story and an interesting main character. The character features an attractive female assassin, naturally this is appealing but the movie goes deeper than that. It is a drama as well as an action thriller.
It's a very good movie and has allot of what I look for in films.

It does have a very, very brief innappropriate scene(not involving the main character of the movie) which I could have done without but other than that this is a superb, touching and compelling action movie with realistic and violent action that's graphically portrayed.

I won't give the movie away but this movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood ending. This movie, is of course, exponentially better than most of what Hollywood churns out and makes the big bucks on via dumb, tasteless people easily impressed by fancy explosions and big slamb bang action. Down with the mainsteam!

Anyway, this is a superb, excellent good movie.
Highly recommended!!",1259193600,,1111,5.021739130434782
8022035,4,B00024I3GC,"4 of 5 stars for this Hong Kong action movie. To start with, let me say that this is a dubbed into English movie. It appears to have been filmed mostly in Hong Kong with a chunk done in South Korea. When you talk about Hong Kong action movies, you first think of kung fu ""wire-work"" movies. Wrong! This movie has zero kung fu and zero wire scenes. On the other hand, Let the Bullets Fly! The photographic style of this movie is much different than Hollywood; much more ah ah Artistic and may scenes to develop the characters--often without words. You really have to watch this movie carefully to get the full value.

The story is about a woman who is a paid assassin. She is extremely good at her work and is hired often to hit powerful people. Her un-doing is one hit that is successful, but, leaves people who want revenge. There is the start of a romance, but, that is really a way to more fully develop her character and history.

Yes, this is a good movie and is worth watching. Be warned, and be prepared, this ain't no Hollywood movie--it is different and it is good.",1254009600,,1074,4.338308457711443
8022036,5,B00024I3GC,"I discovered this movie on Showtime cable. A professional hitwoman, born with a genetic quirk that leaves her literally cold blooded, guns down a mob boss, only to be pursued by his vengeful bodyguard. Along the way she meets and falls for a lonely food vendor. Shes torn between the life shes always known (killing) and the new chance she can have with the vendor. OH, and lots of bullets fly fly fly, lol. Good lil action piece.",1233100800,3,430,4.5256410256410255
