2169252,1,B00065HKL6,"The This might possibly be, the worst sequel (or prequel) ever made.  Well actually that title could also go to AVP and Jason X.

This movie does nothing to follow the story implied in the original movie or novel.  The fact that William Peter Blatty had no involvement in the script or the movie at all should have been a warning to viewers everywhere.  The original exorcism was suppose to center around an African boy that was possessed.  But no, we have the horrible actress that we all remember from Reign of Fire playing a woman possessed.  Linda Blair did a much better job as a child.

Trust me folks and stay away.  This movie is made from the same crap that has dominated the field of good cinema for the last thirteen years.  Lock your doors, and bold your windows.  If you see this movie, bring a gun so you can shoot yourself before it gets too bad.  This is Renny Harlin's  worst film ever.  This movie is bull s*#t spare yourself the horror of viewing it.",1104969600,8,969,4.376404494382022
2169253,3,B00065HKL6,"Like Roger Ebert (see his review on Paul Shrader's Exorcist: Dominion), I find it fascinating to have two expressions of this prequel story. As with Exorcist III (Legion), this production became a creative tug-of-war between director and studio. The house always wins, as they say in Vegas, and the studio had their way in the end. At issue was the studio's desire to deliver on the implied promise of the Exorcist brand. If you are calling the film ""Exorcist"" and audiences expect something of the original experience, then you've got to deliver on that promise - you've got to have an Exorcism in your finale. This hard reality caught up to William Peter Blatty in the third installment (excellent and recommended), but thankfully for Blatty, it didn't require two firm versions to get there. Blatty acquiesced to the studios, figuring that it's better that HE redo the third act under protest than to quit the film and have someone else make a mess of his work. So, in Exorcist: The Beginning, it is Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger) who is ultimately brought in to rework the prequel into a more intense experience that culminates in a priest vs. devil showdown. In the end, Harlin delivers just that. While much of the sets and situations are similar to Exorcist: Dominion, the production design takes on an edgier, dustier, more shadowy and sinister look and feel. Shrader's film looks cleaner and feels a bit safer in comparison. What we lose in the bargain, however, is the focus on Merrin's arc. Both films move the Merrin character from a place of disillusionment to restored belief, from ""Mr. Merrin"" to ""Father Merrin."" However, we come away from Shrader's prequel with a deeper sense of Merrin's growth. Where Harlin gives us visceral thrills, Shrader wins on character. In the end, I'll take Shrader's because it's the story I find most memorable and satisfying as a result of its more focused characterization. I accept the merits of both (Harlin didn't cheapen the material in his reworking) and I enjoy the exercise of revisiting them as part of a longer Exorcist marathon. If you're a bit of a film student, I recommend you give both prequel versions a chance, too. And I recommend you look up that Ebert article, while you're at it.",1410739200,,2244,4.846354166666667

2169256,2,B00065HKL6,"""Exorcist: the Beginning"" is my least favorite film in the series, partially because it goes for the jugular of the scare factor in the audience (making it the most obvious, manipulative, and unsettling entry in the series). I still like arguing that the original film is not horror so much as it is drama (there is a thin line here, I realize). Harlin's film, however, is all out horror--and if you aren't scared to death by the idea of floating demons and abandoned crypts and hidden underground churches, then you might enjoy following poor Father Merrin into the depths of Hell itself. I love the character--and Skarsgaard does a great job with him (he's the most intelligent element of the production)--and the archaeological aspect of these stories have always made them enjoyable for me. The scene where Merrin finds himself standing in front of the Pazuzu statue in the pits of the buried sacrilegious church (while the bats fly madly about him) is a classic movie image--but no less illogical than most other horror fictions that have no deeper intentions than to shock. The voodoo elements (one frightening scene involving a child's invocation into terror) and the music are pretty good, but this one is probably too creepy (and too crappy) for its own damned good. This one is bloodier (and more violent), with more ""subliminal"" flashes of demonic faces and ghostly activity (yes, there's even Tarot cards here!), and a much more fevered pace than any self-respecting ""Exorcist"" fan should like, and because of these facts I just can't recommend it. There are a few moments, but mostly it is an overdone special effects fiasco that should have embarrassed both Paul Schrader and William Blatty in equal measure. I like these religious-themed occult movies, and sometimes it's right to make this content deeply troubling, but this is one effort that just doesn't have enough of a point to it. I like the buried church, and some of the spookiness, but do not confuse this tripe with the dramatic power held in the original (which, by this time, has been diluted by so much parody and over-exposure, that it's hard to get anyone to take its script as seriously as it should be taken).
The DVD is fine, with a good widescreen transfer and a fine picture presentation, and a good audio commentary track (as a nerd, I tend to look for these extras and try to always find the time to consider them if I can--most commentary tracks are great fun to listen to). It's unfortunate, though, that the series finally had to degenerate into utter chaos and submit itself to crappy CGI effects and horror-studded clichs. If it didn't show signs of video-game mentalities, I might have bumped up its grade a little, but really this is just not possible. D+",1393027200,,2750,4.8160676532769555
2169257,1,B00065HKL6,"Both of these prequels are absolutely worthless pictures, they detract from the brilliance and realism of the first film, which is a superb endeavor. They suffer from an inability to commit to serious script writing, story and funding, what they have created instead is an extremely ""dumb downed"" version that should have never been made at all. It is obvious they were made for the ""MTV generation"", as they do not notice the subtle errors which have been egregiously made. Sub-par acting dominates each of them, stilted corny dialogue, written by the inept writer for the masses, Caleb Carr, douses any suspense at all. The film stock also detracts, as it appears that reality is only an imitation, take for example some shots of a cave, they appear to be well lit and inside a fake set, the church itself resembles a piece of plastic, the statues are styrofoam, and the CGI is offensive to the eye.

The original was actually filmed in Syria in historic ruins, which added to the mystery, you will also notice that nothing is really ""believable"" such as what you found in the films from the 1970's, the faces of actors are clean or have some fake blood or dirt smeared on them and the lighting is too bright. The costuming is even worse, and black workers speaking on equal terms to the whites is only rewriting history to explain the storyline to dumb audiences. Plainly, these are some of the worse films that I have ever been forced to see, they should only be watched for their assumptions about how greed has permeated the film industry.",1392163200,,1545,4.680147058823529

2169262,3,B00065HKL6,"Leslie Nielson entertained audiences with the comical REPOSSESSED in 1990, but if ever there was a spoof on THE EXORCIST, it is in Renny Harlin's prequel THE BEGINNING. After Morgan Creek decided to pull the plug on Paul Schrader's version for putting matter before splatter, they brought on a director who was sure to deliver more action and scares. To that extend, it succeeds, but at what cost?

In THE BEGINNING, Lancaster Merrin, a former priest, is hired to recover an ancient artifact that is believed to be resting in a newly-discovered church buried beneath the sands of East Africa. As the seal to the temple is broken, an evil falls upon the land, and a young boy begins to experience symptoms of demonic possession. With his faith in God restored, Merrin will come face to face with the devil in a final conflict!

THE BEGINNING encompasses everything that is wrong with Hollywood, and demonstrates just how little studio executives know about their audiences. Harlin's version has all of the trademarks of a major studio flopbuster: jump scares, forced sentimentality, over-the-top make-up and effects, and most notorious of all, the twist ending. While it is certainly more fast-paced and unexpected than DOMINION, it fails on almost every other level. Stellan Skarsgrd has become tired of his role as Father Merrin, having already acted out the entire script in the earlier version. The pathetic use of sound design to force audience reactions proves how unscary the film really is. Rather than try anything new, Harlin attempts to recreate the bedroom scene from the original EXORCIST within the confines of the church, only this time, he uses a ridiculous villain that brings only laughs instead of chills. This origin story was better left untold, but in the end, Morgan Creek got exactly what they wanted: a bland, bloody shocker that they could market to the masses.

2169263,5,B00065HKL6,"Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) is a priest that witnessed terrible things in WWII. He has lost his faith. He joins an archaeological dig in Kenya. An ancient Byzantine Christian Church has been found in pristine condition. Under the church a satanic alter is found, and a demon possesses a boy. Father Merrin tries to help the boy and the villagers, but it may take his life in the process.

This is a very good movie. It gives you a look at the famous Father Merrin and his past. The acting, special effects, and screenplay are very good. The film isn't as frightening as the original, but it's very powerful nonetheless. IF you like the original movie then this one will probably make you happy.

2169264,2,B00065HKL6,till this day i haven't found a horror film that tops the original exorcist.you don't need blood and gore to make scary. just give the public a face of scars and their set for life. this movie is not that good but the original was excellent.,1336608000,,241,4.260869565217392
2169265,4,B00065HKL6,"It's a rare treat when two very different versions of the same storyline, are played on the same sets with the same cinematographer, most of the same main actors.  I wish more movies were made this way.  Gives you a broader perspective, to see different versions of the same storyline.  Casting in both versions is superb.  Good ensembles.  Film editing is better in The Beginning;  so too, church murals, pagan temple are more realistic;  but Dominion gives you the breathing space to think over whys.  Story line overall, is better in The Beginning, but it leaves out important gaps, so watch Dominion first.  Of the two, Dominion is less gory, but both have cheesy special effects at the end which frankly cheapen a movie, otherwise believably made.

Real demons aren't like this, either -- except at the bottom-most level ('Satan' is a TITLE meaning LEGAL ADVERSARY, and his talk in Bible, is MORAL, intellectual, cultured, erudite).  The silly-level behavior, and the whole idea of some exorcism ritual, is how we see demons, based on only a few of the many demon passages in Bible.  But a deeper Biblical review reveals that they are much more varied, and no amount of ritual can exorcise anything.  Just as there are thugish or cultured, intellectual humans, so too there are thugish or intellectual, demons.  Common sense would tell you that we are not the top of the food chain, but rather our natures reflect something higher.  Thus such a story, resonates in every culture.

If you want to see such group demonism play live, just watch any gathering of Arab Muslims.  How they can assemble instantly to pulverize some area in Israel, demonstrate, trash an embassy over cartoons, you-name-it.  So such a story, resonates in live history you can see play live, on TV.

Common sense and Bible would also tell you that simple faith in Christ ends a possession.  Repeated use of 1John1:9 lessens or ends, demon influence in a believer.  No amount of canned language, and certainly no ordained priest going through an elaborate and silly set of words in costume, ever does anything to exorcise a demon.  That's just human silliness.  So, ignore that bit when you watch these movies.  Ignore also the idea that the demon depicted, is Satan.  Not his personality, at all.

Still, The Beginning has a broader historical range though smaller budget, to provide a bigger backstory than Dominion, which was shot first.  So watch Dominion first;  The Beginning will then have a better lead-in. The premise of both movies is false, but ignore that, too.  There is such a thing as a demon 'territory', though; and every country has at least one.  Again, because demons vary like people do, they fight with each other, band together, and they have their own pride, as well.  The games they prey upon us are part of their own battles with each other: in a civil war which the Bible covers, beginning in Genesis 1:2.  Every culture on earth tells some version of the same story: we are pawns in an invisible war, and after death we will find out how we fared;  meanwhile, most of us don't take that war seriously, at our own peril.  For the universe didn't get here on its own.  A mindless nature doesn't know aethestics.  Takes intelligence, to appreciate beauty, so intelligence created it.  Nuff said.

Am grateful that Morgan Creek released both versions.  Unique genre, the double-movie-release.  Wish there were more movies done like this.  Wish they'd stop the cheesy demonics, but that's how movies like this make money.  The cheesy quality helps us rationalize demons as unreal.  Too hard to deal with the fact we aren't at the top of the food chain, I guess.

DVD quality is okay, but someone should fire whoever designed the disc menu.  You have to ARROW AROUND to find the different categories, when you hit 'disc menu' on your remote;  the only text showing plainly on the upside-down crucifix is PLAY MOVIE; the advertised extras, don't seem to be on the disc!  You find out that they are, if you CAREFULLY and SLOWLY use the arrows on your remote.  The Special Features MIGHT appear at the bottom of the disc menu screen, if you are lucky enough to see it.  Took me five minutes juggling with the arrows on my remote, to find it.  As for the scene selection submenu, forget it.  Someone was trying to be cute, and it's barely visible, where your cursor is, to select a group of scenes.  Of course, as with so many silly disc menu designs, when you select the special feature of the commentary, the cursor then goes to the obscure name, 'play movie', which does NOT mean to play the movie, but to play your selection.  Honestly, doesn't anyone TEST the design before manufacture?

In the Special Features, Harlin's commentary on the movie while it plays, is interesting; he explains his attempt to back up the original Exorcist movie, his main goal;  he also describes the tight schedule and budget, even being hit by a car -- which could have stopped him from completing the filming.  He explains his philosophy of what to show vs. what to hide, what mistakes he thought he made, etc.  Worth hearing.  Helps one appreciate how difficult it is, to make a movie.

In sum, Dominion is the more thoughtful movie; but The Beginning provides more range for the actors, and a larger backstory, larger action story, too.  So, see Dominion first, then watch The Beginning.",1325808000,,5371,4.748917748917749

2169269,4,B00065HKL6,"The Exorcist: The Beginning did not do well in the critic world. I, being a fan of the first Exorcist, watched it on DVD to see what exactly went wrong. I'm glad I do not agree with the negativ reviews.

As soon as the film started it grabbed my attention, and throughout the whole presentation I was really focused of what was going on.  I can state that this film is more shocking and disturbing than the first one (mainly because of technology's growth) and the story line was not bad at all. Many people want to compare prequels or sequels to its original precedent and that is not fair for the crew. It takes place in different times, different location with a different director. In this movie I nearly shut my eyes in couple of scenes that would have never made into the original Exorcist in 1973 due to its appalling content.

Watch this movie with an open mind and expect to get shocked. It is indeed very grotesque but highly entertaining.",1266451200,,949,4.473988439306359

Unlike that piece of trash part II,it's missing it's signature music and a few more scares. Stellan Skaaarsgard does a fine job as Merrin and it is a good follow up to the first. In all fairness as much as i love the first i do believe Exorcist III LEGION is far superior than the original,this one and part ii. I know most won't agree but III to me stands well on it's own and not just a thrown together sequel. It has truly terrifying moments and incredible acting.

2169272,2,B00065HKL6,"The first Exorcist set a standard for horror film that to this day remains unsurpassed - but that has not kept up and coming directors from trying to overthrow the omnipotent original. Three times now Hollywood has tried to deliver a film equal to or beyond the first, and they always fail. There is something so sinister and evil about the first movie that no one has yet to get a handle on. Exorcist: The Beginning is yet another failure.

Probably because the movie has computer animated jackals in it. Probably because it refers to Nazi atrocities (and we've been in a Nazi deluge for the past ten years, owing to Saving Prv. Ryan, et al.). Probably because it uses such cheap tricks to scare the audience (animals skulking around, doors blowing open without warning and scattering paper around, innocent looking children who prophesy death, things that jump out of nowhere for no reason).

One day a director will arise with the power to make a horror film that annihilates the original Exorcist. Until then, the faithful will just have to wait.",1245801600,3,1050,4.763736263736264

2169274,2,B00065HKL6,"If you were finally looking for a worthy candidate to live up to the original 1973 movie then keep looking. This film is a lot more about cheap shots at startling people than actually bringing out the kind of scare and depth that the first movie gave us. While production values are high and the movie does achieve its goal at scaring its audience it's done at the expense of a good story. The sad thing is there was room to make this a truly engaging movie, but instead they took the low road. Sorry folks.

I got to admit it looks really nice. The settings and landscapes are striking and the imagery is sharp and top notch. Cinematography is beautiful and the props and costumes do give you the illusion of the 1940's timeline. Also the movie does accomplish its goal in the scare department. Sounds effects, music, lighting... they all lend themselves into making this movie a high caliber production... at least on the outside. While all these factors make the movie look good and the first part of the script does set the stage for something very intriguing once you get past all that things start falling apart.

For one the scares they focus on are nothing more than cheap shots. There is no eerie kind of scary here. More like the sneaking up behind someone and saying ""Boo!"" kind. I can't count how many times you see the film try and startle the audience instead of actually frightening them. It's all careful use of sound effects and a music score to queue the ""Boo!"" along with plenty of false alarms. It got old. The cheap shots are also evident on the script itself. You would spend a focused amount of time on someone or something just to have that startled scare at the end. Forget plot development. Most of the movie is just trying to catch you off guard to scare you once again.

The film tries to be interesting but it spends too much time trying to freak you out to actually go anywhere. Ultimately it makes for a lot of senseless actions and events that can't even be explained with the ultra-lame plot twist that, just like the rest of the events, doesn't make sense when you think about it. In other words the story is convoluted, trite and has no method to its madness.

I guess if you like to be scared and don't care how they do it AND don't care if the story behind it is well executed then here you go. I can't help but feel they had a good thing started here and decide to instead mess it all up other than develop a truly engaging (and ultimately scary) movie. The first Exorcist movie is still the best and everything else that has followed only pales in comparison.. including this pretty on the outside and mediocre on the inside prequel.",1204070400,2,2672,4.435845213849287
2169275,2,B00065HKL6,"""The demon is a liar,"" Father Merrin warns us in the original Exorcist. ""He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.""  Unfortunately, the same is true about certain Hollywood producers and directors.  Case in point: Exorcist: The Beginning, directed by Renny Harlin.

It seems the best that can be said about this film by those who prefer it over Paul Schrader's more intellectually honest rendering of the Father Merrin story is that there is better ""continuity.""  This fallacious continuity seems to consist of bringing back the statuette of Pazuzu, the Muslim metalworkers pounding away in Cairo,  the suddenly arrested clock as Merrin pours over sketches of Pazuzu, and a puke-faced possession absurdly and ineptly reminiscent of Linda Blair's performance in the original.  But these examples of ""continuity"" only demonstrate a lack of creativity and artistic credibility on the part of Harlin.  The movie as a whole is a cinematic train-wreck.

This prequel opens up with an ancient battlefield laid strewn with the bodies of Byzantine Christian soldiers.  We are then treated to a CGI'ed pan of thousands of inverted crucifixions across the entire landscape.  Notwithstanding the complete absence of any visible woods from which these crosses could conceivably be constructed, the scene inherently precludes many of the other premises of this film.  If a force of thousands of well-trained, well-equipped soldiers is so easily eviscerated by Satan, then how much more chance can a highly-trained, highly-skilled group of masons and artisans have of constructing the ornate Church of St. Michael to contain him?

Beyond this and many other problems with the story is the glaring failure of Harlin to explore the relationship between Father Merrin and Father Francis (as Schrader aptly does in Dominion with an inversed representation of the relationship between Father Merrin and Father Karras from the first Exorcist).  More than being a mere horror film, The Exorcist explored the journey of faith lost and faith restored as much as it did the triumph of good over evil.  Harlan's film misses the opportunity to portray this and hence does NOT provide key thematic continuity.  By the film's end, Father Merrin may have redonned his clerical garb and eschewed the financial motivation for his assignment, but the way the film moves so haphazardly, its clear that this is more of a gratuitous afterthought.

What else are we provided as evidence of either a severely retarded cinematic vision, the suffocating commercialism of the film industry, or both?  There is Jefferies, our quintessential  white devil; obnoxious, racist, sexist, as physically repulsive as he is in his personal comportment.  A nice touch of ""political correctness"" apparently not sufficed by the belligerence of the British detachment sent to thwart the Turkana from uprising.  Frankly, his presence in the story defies justification. Then, there is the way the role of the Turkana and its Chief Sebituana is fairly well ignored.  They are reduced to two-dimensional ""spear-chuckers.""  Then, there is the ridiculous over-use of animated hyenas and crows throughout the film.  The absurdly melodramatic suicide of Monsieur Bession, whom we find out later is incredibly the husband of Sarah Novak, the Holocaust-suriving Jewish doctor in Derati.  And Sarah's own possession and exorcism so heavily drawing upon the Linda Blair experience that you begin to feel like you're watching Rocky II with its ridiculous regurgitation of its respective original.

Many fans of the first Exorcist believe that, despite its flaws, Harlin's creation is a necessary companion to Schrader's.  Why?  Because Harlin ""fills in"" alot of the ""blanks"" of the Schrader film.  But this presumes that the blanks really exist to begin with or that any person of reasonable intelligence could not fill them in for themselves without having to endure an erratically paced and gratuitously grossed-out fiasco such as this.

Beyond these problems is the script itself.  Much of the dialogue -- especially between Merrin and Semelier, and Francis and Merrin (after Merrin discovers the false graves) -- is forced and contrived.  It serves more to instruct us of the facts rather than to tell a story;  a critical difference between bad writing and good.

Of all involved in the creation of The Beginning, I truly feel sorry for Stellan Skarsgard.  Stellan, who plays Father Merrin in both versions, is a highly talented actor.  It is unfortunate that this version was released in theatres instead of Paul Schrader's.  Only in Dominion are Stellan's skills and talent truly cultivated with a superior story, script, and direction.

Those looking for the proper heir to the Blatty-Friedkin legacy should turn to Paul Schrader's Dominion.  Dominion may have its minor flaws but the story is as coherent as it is intelligent.  Exorcist: The Beginning should be exorcized from the cinematic body and expunged from memory. Amen.",1194134400,2,5008,5.243718592964824

In fact, I still own the famous violet dress Izabella Scorupco(Dr. Sarah)wore in the final showdown with Lankaster. So, I feel the need to explain some things to the public. It's been two years now and I'm very upset with all the bashing this film has taken since it's release on home video/cable. Most of these reviews I've been reading on the internet are not only harsh but very cruel and also very ignorant. One even said they could not believe Izabella as a demon because she is ""too prettty."" Another one wrote they couldn't believe Stellan Skarsgard as the younger Father Merrin beause he is ""too fat"" to have lived long enough to be the old priest in 1973. People like this have no business writting reviews for anyone. I will remind them and all of you that don't already know. This was the only ""Exorcist"" film since the original to go to #1 at the box office. The second film couldn't do it even with Linda Blair. The third film couldn't do it with George C. Scott and Jason Miller. This should tell you something. It was not a great film but it is not that bad. There were many problems for sure, that is why the making of ""Prequel"" came about. Directors, writers and studio heads will not always agree on things. The original director, John Frankenheiemer died and Paul Schrader was brought in to make the film. The studio executives at Morgan Creek (the studio)liked the insightful story-line but felt a ""Exorcist"" film should be more intense and exciting. Renny Harlin was then brought in to give them just that. In the end, I don't blame them. The Exorcist films are horror and shock, not a story of a man and his personal demons for two hours with a bald devil that is more shrink than devil. The fans of the series want to see the priest facing the evil, violent demon and winning. So, with this film we did a bit of both. In the end, you can never re-create and top a great movie no matter what you try. Yet, Exorcist: The Beginning is a good film with some very cleaver idea's here and there.

The noises are a poor substitute for suspense, as all modern movies do.  It's like bracing yourself for the next unexpected smashing of frying pans behind your ears.

2169282,5,B00065HKL6,"In 2004, a fourth installment to THE EXORCIST was released to audiences around the world, for them to feel more terror. This installment is brilliantly and appropriately titled, EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING. This sequel is a prequel showing you Father Lankester Merrin's first encounter with the deadly Evil Spirit before it went on to possess Regan McNeil.

  In the 1940s, LANKESTER MERRIN (played by the brilliant Stellan Skarsgrd) has recently lost his faith in God, and has decided to withdrawl his priesthood. He continues his life as an Archeologist Investigator. He is assigned a new case: to investigate the strange goingson in the city of Kenya, Africa. He travels to Kenya with FATHER FRANCIS (played by James D'Arcy) by his side. They arrive in Kenya, where they meet the beautiful SARAH (played by the beautiful Izabella Scorupco), a nurse working at the local hospital. After meeting Sarah, Lankester meets young JAMES (played by James Bellamy), and his younger brother, JOSEPH (played by Remy Sweeney). Lankester, Father Francis, and Sarah discover that a beautiful church was built in Kenya only to be buried after it was completed. The local Africans continue to dig it up, and with the help of Lankester, investigate why this church was buried when its construction was completed.

  That late afternoon, James and Joseph are playing around in a nearby cave, where hyenas stumble upon James and Joseph, and viciously kill James, where they leave Joseph in shock. Joseph's father takes him to the hospital where Sarah cares for him. Over the course of the next few days, Lankester and Sarah begin seeing things that are more evil than you could ever imagine. They enter the church, which has finally been uncovered, and begin searching for the answers they are in need of. They happen to find the church's huge statued crucifix hung upside down, in the symbol of Satanism. What the Hell is going?

  One night, while taking a shower, Sarah happens to here a noise coming from somewhere inside her house. She continues to search for this mysterious noise, until she finds herself standing in a puddle of blood...coming from her private area. This she has seen after she saw Joseph running by. She goes to check on Joseph, but Joseph is sound asleep. Lankester and Sarah come to the conclusion that Joseph must be suffereing from demonic possession. Later that night is where we find how Lankester lost his faith in God. The German Nazi's had stumbled upon the village where Lankester worked as a priest, captured all the civilians and had Lankester decide which one of the civilians dies.

  The next night, all hell breaks loose, where the British soldiers and the Kenya Africans begin fighting each other, where the soldiers turn on each other, as the Africans do the same, as this was in B.C. Lankester runs to the hospital to grab Sarah and Joseph and take them to saftey from the war and sandstorm, but neither one of them are to be found. Lankester runs to the church and finds Father Francis' dead body. At this moment, Lankester winds up regaining his faith in God, dabs his finger in the spilt Holy water, and uses it to make a sign of the cross on his forehead, which is when he finds Joseph. Joseph is fine, but his is scared to death, for there is someone else that is under demonic possession...Sarah. She, Lankester, and Joseph battle it out, until Lankester succeeds in the exorcism. Sarah is free from the evil spirit, but it left for dead, for once it left her body, Sarah, unfortunately had died. Lankester arrives back from his assignment, and it appears to be that Lankester has gone back to being a priest. Lankester seems to think that this is all over, but he has know idea of what lies ahead, come 1973.

  This is a great film to close the franchise. I was really amazed at how well this film was put together. Yeah, it was not as scary as THE EXORCIST, but this one still gave me the creeps. I just want to point out that, DOMINION-PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST is not an official sequel to the whole franchise. What happened was that this film had gone through three directors. The first one had mysteriously died, where they brought in Paul Schrader as the second director. He directed the entire film, which turned out to be DOMINION-PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST, and then held a screening for it in April of 2003. But it was not received well at all, for Paul had done everything opposite of what was originally wanted by the producers. He was fired and the film was shelved. Renny Harlin (who directed A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4: THE DREAM MASTER) came in as the third director. He changed 85%-90% of Paul Schrader's script and cast. The only actor he kept on board was Stellan Skarsgrd. He shot the film, and it was released in the Summer of 2004. DOMINION-PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST was released on DVD in 2005, so that fans could compare and contrast between EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING and DOMINION-PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST.",1157587200,4,4952,4.735191637630662

Some of the film is well done, but ironically... the strong points to this film are borrowed from the unreleased film ""Dominion.""

The ""Regan"" style possession at the film's conclusion is a guilty pleasure... once again meeting the vulgar, blasphemous, profane, sarcastic, white eyed hag from the original.

But on this theme, the film actualy plagerizes scenes from the orginial! Scenes showing a blacksmith, detailing the movements and mannerisms of psychiatric patients, etc. The copying of the original transcends any typical ""homage.""

Weaknesses of the film include fake looking CGI effects and animals, and a far too powerful demon (Spoiler) who seems to be victorous in the end. Like Exorcist 3, it's actually too depressing.

2169284,1,B00065HKL6,"'Exorcist - The Beginning', leaving its excellent 1973 prequel to one side, and judging it as a movie in its own right, is a blindingly unoriginal and horribly boring movie.

There's Evil in them thar Valleys, I tells ya - or so senses jaded ex-Priest-turned-Archaeologist Lankester Merrin. Reluctantly accepting a commission to examine a newly-unearthed 5th-century Church in a remote African valley, he stumbles upon a buried ancient evil, that disrupts him to his very core and threates the balance between good and evil on Earth.

At least, that's what the plot would have you believe. In actuality, this is as straightforward a suspense/horror hybrid as they come, with a ton of cliches and plenty of piss-poor special effects ruining what little chances the movie had of making a lasting impression.

On the acting front, we have several perfectly competent and - dare I say it - talented actors, struggling with a dull-as-dishwater script. Stellan Skarsgaard is a great physical choice to echo Max Von Sydow's older Merrin, and is himself a great actor - see 'Ronin' and 'City of Ghosts' for proof of this. Ditto Izabella Scorupco, in movies like 'Goldeneye' and 'The Driver' she shows a fluid and adaptable talent, and is usually convincing to watch. Remy Sweeney as the demon-plagued Joseph turns in a pretty good performance, too, and it's refreshing to see a child actor with actual talent. But not one of these characters, never once during the movie, comes across as anything more than a throwaway and two-dimensional cliche. And that's the fault of the lousy screenplay.

Full of moments that we'll all have seen so many times in plenty of other horror movies, the plot and dialogue of 'Exorcist - The Beginning' could belong to any number of movies. There's nothing unique here, nothing special. If you look at what makes the more successful horror movies of recent years memorable - films like 'Ringu', 'Saw', 'What Lies Beneath', 'Blair Witch Project', 'The Others', and so on - you'll see a common trend of well-paced, original storylines, and intelligent, plausible dialogue that builds both character and atmosphere. 'Exorcist - The Beginning' has none of these things, instead relying on such tired and worn-out devices as flashback Nazis, crazy people killing themselves as a precursor to the evil, stupid first-worlders not realising that the natives know what's actually going on, and more ""There's something very wrong here"" moments of revalation than you can shake a stick at.

Things go from bad to worse (or, in this case, boring to unbelievable) with the arrival of the ""special"" effects. Hyenas outlined in blue and some truly awful sandstorm panoramas are matched by the fakeness of the demonic makeup and movement at the end of the picture. Linda Blair's makeup in the original 'Exorcist' looks implausible now, sure, but this movie's effects stink from the get-go.

And Renny Harlin simply isn't a very good director. There's no visual charisma in the direction here; much like the plot and dialogue, the directorial style is a sort of mishmash of the more boring parts of better movies.

Rent it if you're curious, otherwise, just leave it be. This is not a good movie, nor is it even a particularly well-made one. It's flat as a pancake, totally unbelievable and quite, quite boring.",1145664000,6,3318,5.0108892921960075

2169291,2,B00065HKL6,"For those of us who came of age in the 1970s, it is hard to imagine what younger people must think of ""The Exorcist,"" a movie that is so entrenched in its own legend, it's difficult to see it as only a movie.  ""The Exorcist"" is what it is: an effective but ugly film that in its own time was not considered flawless.  Critics were widely divided in their opinions.  Some found it artistic while others considered it to be hollow spectacle.  Either way, it was strongly attached to a tightly conceived novel and crafted in such a way that gave it some power.

What makes ""Exorcist - The Beginning"" so disappointing is the fact that it is attached only to box-office aspirations and has been made by 21st-century standards, which is to say that it insists on resembling a computer game and appealing to a new generation of people used to horror movies that eschew imagination.  The gritty, realistic tone of ""The Exorcist,"" and all the best movies made in the 1970s, has been abandoned for the sake of spectacle with little substance.  The scale feels too enormous, the digital effects are shoddy, the sets and lighting are highly artificial.  It is not altogether awful; it has a few eerie scenes and some well-timed shocks, but there is something pointlessly grim and self-important about it all.  Director Renny Harlin has landed a plum job, but he is not up to the task.  When the actors utter lines lifted directly from ""The Exorcist,"" the smug attempts at homage only point out what this movie is missing.

The overblown climax borders on the ridiculous, but not in a fun way, because the heart of this movie is so dark and insipid fun appears to have been banished from the proceedings.  The victim of possession here sports a creamy smooth pistachio-green make-up on the face, arms, bare legs, everywhere (just why and how a human being would turn such a color seems to be a moot point) and moves about in ways that make Linda Blair's Regan, who merely thrashed about and levitated from a bed, seem like an attentive Sunday School student.  By comparison, the events in the original movie come across like news footage.  More accurately, they are portrayed on a personal scale which this film lacks in spades, despite its stagey attempts to show evil in human terms.

When all is said and done, this version of how Father Merrin supposedly became an exorcist, is so removed from the gist of ""The Exorcist"" it is clear the two films were made in separate centuries.",1140912000,3,2470,4.645977011494253
2169292,2,B00065HKL6,"Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsgrd) is summoned by a collecter of rare antiquities, Semelier (Ben Cross) and asked to find a mysterious statue of the demon Pazuzu in Africa. Once there, Merrin participates in an archeological excavation which unearths a Byzantine church. The mysterious and perfectly preserved temple dates back to a time before Christianity arrived to the region and the evidence suggests it was buried as soon as it was completed. Panic among the townspeople soon follow and evidence of a demonic force gives reason to suspect that something else was unearthed.

The original ""Exorcist"" was greeted with mixed reviews when it was first released during the Christmas season of 1973. However, that did not stop it from becoming an almost instant classic garnering several Oscar nods and praise from film buffs everywhere.

The fate of its sequels on the other hand suffered the exact opposite. The first sequel ""The Heretic"" has been branded by many as the worst sequel in film history. An exaggerated claim but there is no denying that the film is inferior to the original. The second sequel ""Exorcist III"" received poor reviews and lousy box-office returns but has since developed a rather loyal following. ""The Beginning"" critically suffered the same fate. We'll just have to wait and see if time is as kind to this instalment as it was to Blatty's ""Exorcist III"".

Directed by Renny Harlin, ""The Beginning"" is not that bad as a horror film. If you view this with your expectations set low, you may be surprised by it. I also think the film's main problem is having ""Exorcist"" in its title. I think people would have accepted this film and would have been kinder to it had it not been a prequel to one of the greatest horror movies of all times. If judged on its own terms, ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" has a lot to offer the horror film fan; Decent visual effects (less CGI would have been nice though), a good cast, decent make-up effects, some good cinematography, good production values and an interesting storyline. But I guess you can say the same about the first sequel - ""The Heretic"" and we all know how that one turned out. I guess execution is key and it is in the execution where both films lose it and collapse. I did find the demon (or demons) in this film frightening in certain scenes. We see it's grisly work throughout the village but it never really materializes. It also appears to be far more potent than in the previous films. In the original, the malevolent entity almost destroys the spirit of a little girl. Here we see it consume an entire town as well as its people.

The film's biggest disappointment is in its weak and extremely cheesy exorcism scene. Without giving spoilers, the entire climax seemed rushed, broke no new grounds and it seemed like a pathetic attempt to copy the originals style. If shock value was what the film-makers were aiming for, they failed and the end result is a laughable imitation of the original film and the lame, sexual dialogue had no real purpose other than to try to achieve what Friedkin achieved back in 1973. Also disappointing is the unnecessary twist. It has become obvious that none of these movies, from the ""Heretic"" all the way up to ""The Beginning"", bothered in keeping continuity since the characters and timelines do not match up at all making this a very disjointed franchise.

With that said, I found this much maligned prequel to be a somewhat enjoyable night at the theatre. It's better than many of its detractors would have you to believe but it is miles away from being great. It is on par with the equally panned ""The Heretic"" but inferior to Part III which is far more effective in its psychological terror, and this film would have been much better had they not fumbled the all too important climax.

I recommend ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" to the casual horror film fan but it needs to be viewed with an open mind especially if you're a fan of the original film. If not, you will most definitely, religiously hate it.

What he encounters however is pretty much what the viewer would expect: demonic possession, camera trick quick scares, and grisly gore effects.  Where Exorcist: The Beginning falters is it's incoherent story which relies more on shocks than anything else, some pretty lame CGI effects (the CGI generated hyenas are unbelievably laughable), and Harlin's surprisingly uninspired direction.  What little the film has going for it is the casting of Skarsgrd as Merrin, and some great cinematography, but that's it.

Any filmmakers presumptuous enough to make a prequel to what is arguably the most beloved horror film of all time sure as hell better know what they're doing.  Those responsible for ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" most decidedly do not, for this is a trite, tiresome film that never comes even close to duplicating the power and imagination of the 1973 original, settling instead for run-of-the-mill suspense sequences and more devil-on-the-loose clichs than one can shake a crucifix at.

The film is set in Kenya in 1949, where a church has recently been discovered inexplicably buried for 1500 years.  Merrin, a former-Catholic-priest-turned-archaeologist (and the Max Von Sydow character in the original ""Exorcist""), is called in to investigate this perplexing phenomenon (the church is a surprise because apparently Christians didn't send missionaries to that part of the world till many centuries later).  As soon as he arrives there, bizarre occurrences begin to happen - animals act strangely, people disappear without a trace, furniture moves by itself etc. - implying that Satan himself may be alive and well in the vicinity.

Rather than employing either originality or inspiration, ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" instead dutifully trots out all the requisite devil-movie clichs it can lay its dirty little hands on:  the ex-cleric undergoing a crisis of faith, who, nevertheless, finds himself doing battle with forces he no longer believes exist; the original head of the investigation, driven to madness by evil forces, who now spends his time locked up in an insane asylum drawing pictures of devils and demons ad infinitum; the representative from the Vatican whose sole job it is to make the Church look good even if that means engaging in cover-up, deceit and subterfuge.  Director Renny Harlin can't bring any of this to life, mainly because his style is so redolent of the hundreds of other such films that have appeared since the original ""Exorcist.""  The predictable phony scares, the red herring dream sequences, and the electric power going out at the most inopportune moments all combine to make the film little more than a compendium of cheap Satanic thriller cliches.  Even the digitized special effects are generally unconvincing and second-rate (particularly bad are the man-eating hyenas who, ironically, make US laugh instead of the other way around).

As most people probably already know, ""The Beginning"" is actually the SECOND filming of this particular story.  The first, directed by Paul Schrader, was, reportedly, too slow-moving and ""unscary"" for Warner Brothers execs to consider releasing.  They then hired Harlin to completely re-shoot the script, with a couple of different actors in key roles.  I haven't seen the Schrader version (entitled ""Dominion""), but it is generally considered the finer of the two by those who have.  There's a Tinsel Town irony for you:  the poorer version is released instead of the better one, then it bombs at the box office anyway.  Only in Hollywood!",1136073600,4,3018,5.254166666666666

Plot: Having abandoned his faith in God, Father Merrin joins a British Archaeological excavation in Kenya, where an inexplicably pristine Christian Byzantine church has been unearthed- looking as if it had been buried on the day it was completed. But beneath the church, something much older sleeps, waiting to be awoken. As madness swiftly descends upon the Villagers and British soldiers, Merrin watches helplessly as atrocities are commited against an innocent village. atraocities he has seen before and pryaed never to see again. Now he must try and stop this madness he sees and put the evil back where it came from.

Everything takes place many years before the original Exorcist and mainly revolves around the character of Father Merrin from the original movie. I think this takes place thirty years before the original. Anyway, Father Merrin goes to Africa and finds an artifact that relates to demonic possesion within the region. There is more to the story than that but I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. Between this and Dominion, I thought this movie did a better job with the story and intense scenes. Though these intense scenes don't quite match up to the original Exorcist, they still go along with the story. Plus, this version is not as drawn out as Dominion and I thought that the ending was better too. Overall more action and of interests, Exorcist Beginning is the version to see. And yes, you definately want to see this before watching the exorcist movies for the stories in each one follow after the other. As I mentioned in my Dominion review, it is interesting that the same actor who played Merrin played him in this version as well. Also, Exorcist Beginning had better character development than did Dominion.",1132963200,,1216,4.713615023474178
2169300,3,B00065HKL6,"When this prequel came out all the critics hated it and director, Renny Harlin does have a well deserved reputation for making lousy movies but Exorcist-the Begining is not as bad as you may have heard. Actually, Stellan Skarsgrd, the actor playing young Father Merrin is darn good. He really does look and sound like a young Max Von Sydow. The other actors aren't much but they don't have to be. The whole point of the movie is to show how Fr. Merrin got out of his post WWII funk, got back into the saddle and grew up to become the church's number one demon smiter in time to save little Reagan in the Excorcist. On that level the movie succeeds.

Don't sit down in front this thing expecting something great. Don't expect to be frightened or to feel the same way you did when you saw the original because that won't happen. However, if you take this film for what it is-- a B movie then you'll enjoy yourself.",1131321600,,912,4.364705882352941
2169301,3,B00065HKL6,"The main difference here is that the director of this film got a more impassioned performance from Skaarsgard and cast than Paul Schrader. This fails mostly on the throwback reliance on Friedkinesque special effects. Sorry, but we did that already. Maybe on the large screen it came off better, but having watched Schrader's version first, I was convinced that it was the better story of the two. Much goes unexplained here, and in fact this film almost pre-supposes that you've seen Schrader's version for the background. There are huge gaps in why things happen in the sequence they do, and yet elipitical references are amde to film Schrader shot. Quite odd.

On its own merits, everyone looks more involved in the picture. For Skaarsgard, he has a prettier, sexier Rachel to work with. This actress doesn't exude the guilt of the actress in Schrader's film, but she has asmoldering sexuality and a body to match. The reference to the Psycho shower scene comes off effectively. Ben Cross makes a cameo to begin and end the story that would have worked especially well in Schrader's film.

And that's the odd part. Were you to select the better parts of each film, you would have had a really terrific thriller. Where this one falls down is the gore and goofy satanism. I can't imagine that Lucifer is that much of a dweeb.

I watched both on Halloween, copied them onto my hard rive and hope to release my own synthesis in China in the next few weeks. That is the plan, anyway. See you all in Shanghai.",1130803200,,1505,4.6716981132075475
2169302,4,B00065HKL6,"Remy Harlin's version of 'The Exorcist' was supposed to correct the mistakes (real or imaginary) of Schrader's production that was never released to the theater. While this film is quite good I tend to gravitate to Schrader's as the definitive and best of the two. Be that as it may there are a number of sequences in Harlin's film that add some additional and valuable material to the storyline that are missing in the other version.

First, I preferred the opening sequence in this film showing the devastating massacre of a 4th century Christian army being myteriously wiped out in East Africa by an invisible supernatural presence. This perfectly set the tone for what was to follow.

Another positive addition was the image of Pazuzu shown several times. First in the hand of a dying 4th century Catholic priest, again in 1949 in a coffee shop in Cairo, Egypt when Father Merrin is hired to join in the archeological dig in East Africa and finally once more in the strange, demented drawings of Bession (Patrick O'Kane) the archeologist originally in charge of the dig before he went insane after entering the excavated church. These scenes clearly established the Pazuzu imagery and solidly maintained the continuity between this film and the original. Something Schrader's adaptation failed to do.

The majority of the main cast remained the same as the Schrader version except for Father Francis who was now played by James D'Archy and Izabella Scorupco as the villages resident Dr. and potential love interest, Sarah.

If you're a true, hardcore fan of 'The Exorcist' series you'll simply have to buy both versions and pick and choose your favorite scenes.",1130025600,4,1665,4.9784172661870505
2169303,4,B00065HKL6,"""Exorcist: the Beginning"" is that most unexpected of cinematic treasures, a potent, garish, gory, seething peppercorn of pure unadulterated horror, where every sequence, nook and Stygian-dark cranny exudes the stink and sweat of Evil.

It is to producer Morgan Creek's credit, then, that the Power of Cash compelled them to do whatever it took---including sacking the project's initial director Paul Schrader and replacing him with the artistically uneven action film helmer Renny Harlin and effectively reshooting the entire movie---to get this film to market by any means necessary. It is Box office dollars that compel Thee!

Whatever the case, Morgan Creek made a good gambit, and Renny Harlin has brewed up a potent, nasty horror flick, red in tooth and claw, an atmospheric little potboiler brimming with malice and coming across as a kind of deranged concoction of ""Evil Dead"" and ""The English Patient"". From its harrowingly epic on a 5th century killing field to its stoic close in Vatican City, ""Exorcist: the Beginning"" handily surpasses any of the other films in the series in terms of sheer scares and apocalyptic imagery (with the possibly exception of the woefully underrated Exorcist 3)---and it serves the whole dish up with an extra helping of the Red Sauce. Yum!

Harlin's film centers on the Roman Catholic Father Lancaster Merrin (played brilliantly to the last intonation by the incomparably talented Stellan Skarsgard), a bibulous former priest who defrocked himself after a nasty encounter with Nazis made him doubt his faith in God and a sane universe. Like fellow Nazi-hater Indiana Jones, Merrin takes up archeology, and when the film opens in 1949 he has been invited by the British government to an archeological dig in East Africa.

French archeologists have turned up what appears to be a 5th century Christian church, mystifying the Vatican, and driving the chief archeologist into a Nairobi madhouse. Merrin arrives at the spooky clinic on the verge of the site tended by the delicious Sarah (played sweatily by the equally delicious Izabella Scorupko), spelunks around the desecrated fane with Vatican emissary Father Francis (the poised James D'Arcy doing what he can in a terminally thankless role), discovers a decidedly pre-Christian holy site sealed beneath the Christian church, and entirely too late realizes that the Demon Pazuzu has gotten out of its prison to paint the town Red. Literally.

This is no film for the faint-hearted, as all kinds of diabolic nastiness ensues: cannibalistic ravens, sneering Nazis, Stellan Skarsgard chug-a-lugging one whiskey after another, truckloads of open wounds and sores, gratuitous CGI-flies, entomology gone wrong, ample blood and gore and slime, the ugliest-bartender-in-England winner with his Incredible Melting Face who just wants a little lovin' from our hapless heroine, an aboriginal exorcism rite that manages to make Father Merrin's original exorcism look like an Oprah episode, and some of the most ghastly scenes of child brutality I've ever seen---try to watch the hyena-attack without feeling your blood curdle.

Technically the film has some bumps (the CGI flies) but otherwise delivers, with gorgeous cinematography by Vittorio Stiraro (""The Last Emperor"", ""Apocalypse Now""). Harlin's directing is competent, fast-paced, and unintrusive, and he conjures up the soukhs of Cairo, the killing fields of Africa, or the dark places in the Earth where Evil dwells with equal precision. As for the acting, Skarsgard carries the flick as a man riddled with doubts and yet determined to press on; he is backed up by a superlative cast without a single weak performance.

Let me clarify: Exorcist ""the Beginning"" is a terrifying movie, bottom line, and a film that can make this jaded reviewer squirm is potent medicine indeed. The 20-minute finale tries too hard to evoke the possession of the original, falls flat, and thus weakens what could have been an epic battle between Merrin and the Dark, but otherwise the movie creeps and crawls: here director Harlin, against all of the odds, has condensed a potent brew of unrelenting malice and evil---truly evoking the Biblical ""terror that flieth by noonday, the shadow that creepeth by night"".

So saddle up, exorcists: get the pickaxe ready, hoist your Roman Ritual, mix a little whiskey into that Holy Water, and and keep an eye on those very hungry shadows.

The acting and story are really good and there's a big surprise near the end. The only problem I had was a scene with CGI animals but it ends pretty quickly.

2169306,5,B00065HKL6,"I won't speak much of the story plot line.  I just want to add my two cents to state why I think this movie is excellent.

The colorization and lighing of this film are beautiful.  Very rich at times, then dark but with disturbing content at other times.  The music is haunting, and the sound effects often are very scary by themselves.

The casting is excellent.  Every character was perfect for their part.  It seemed that the supporting cast knew the weight of their roles and played with great intensity and purpose, even the children. Stellan Skarsgrd plays his part with old-world class.  With a slight Euro accent, brooding faces betray hints of pain, deep sorrow and guilt, revealing the character Father (Mr.) Merrin as a broken man with a loss of faith and hope.  His flashbacks of horrible memories link together to reveal the story of how Merrin became such a broken, unbelieveing man.

Izabella Scorupco plays a great role of a lovely lady that makes you wonder why such a person would already be living in such a God-forsaken village of extreme poverty and disease.  She gives Merrin a face to ask questions of the village and an ear to reveal more of his own anguish through their frequent evenings of bottles of scotch in a dark, desolate village tavern.  Izabella's acting is superb and also Euro classic.  She was a pleasure to watch.  The local African tribesmen were strong, realistic and very convincing.  When some of them became evil, they were quite scary!

Much of this excellent story is told through illustration and wordless scenes, and it eventually builds to a very tense, disturbing ending.  As Father Merrin moves through the movie making his horrible discoveries of the origins of the evil, at times I felt like I was being pulled along against my better sensibilities.  I felt genuine fear for the Father as he began to explore the deep and terrible origins of this story.

The location is excellent.  Using excellent colorization, the location lends itself to portray a desolate, fearful place where a horrible truth is about to break open, and when it does, you don't want to be there.

After watching this movie, I felt the impression that everything involving this production was done with great care.  The filming was superb, the actors excellent, the progression and direction of the movie, the sound effects--all added up to what I would call a ""sleeping classic.""

This is not the original Exorcist, but a rich classy film that fulfills some questions of the Exorcist's origins.  Take it for face value and don't compare it to the others.  It has a right to stand on it's own.  Oh, and one last note.  I think that Stellan Skarsgrd has not played his greatest role yet.  The guy's screen presence is HUGE.  He is going to do something very big and successful.  I hope you get a chance to enjoy this sleeper.",1123027200,2,2849,4.720081135902637

2169309,5,B00065HKL6,"From what I've heard of the reaction to this one I don't think that too many people - even those who did like it - are going to agree with the above sentiment but that's my personal take on it.  I'm probably one of the few bigtime horror fans who, while I liked the original Exorcist, doesn't consider it to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made (actually, I thought Part III surpassed it) although, having now seen the prequel I may soon go back and rewatch the original, see if maybe there's something I just didn't 'get' when I was relatively new to horror, or something to see in a new light after this one.

Nonetheless, onto the movie at hand: taking place in Africa some decades before the original, ""The Beginning"" chronicles events that were alluded to in the original (more in the book than the movie, if I remember correctly) but never elaborated on.  Stellan Skarsgard as a younger Father Merrin does a great job heading up a terrific ensemble cast, the overall production is great (although there is, admittedly, a bit of a 'choppy' feel to the flow of the film's continuity at times - not a crippling hitch), and the characters feel real.  The evil of the demon Pazuzu (and this isn't a spoiler; it's evident from the movie's opening minutes on) is twofold: the more tangible physical threat of a human possessed by such an entity, with the accompanying beyond-human abilities we see throughout the whole Exorcist series (enhanced strength, telekinetic abilities, the power to contort and twist into all manner of 'impossible' positions without breaking the host body, etc.); and then the 'slippery slope' effect that the demon's mere proximity has on even many of those in its prescence not actuall possessed.  Like a communicable disease it seems to cause those around it to deteriorate on a good/evil level until they're heading down dark and violent paths they most likely would not have normally taken.

As a forewarning, this movie is, like the original, not just frightening and disturbing but truly sick and vile in places; and that's totally appropriate here because they're going for a realistic portrayal of what a demon, regretfully, would really be like if one were to manifest on Earth.  The more visually impressive, more 'some-trace-of-redeeming-qualities' and more awe-inspiring demons inhabiting many horror movies (including some of the greatest ever made) are what their respective films have generally called for; while this Pazuzu, not merely evil but obscenely evil, is just what the ""Exorcist"" series calls for (another example of a great horror movie that really goes to extremes with the depravity and loathesomeness of its demon is ""The Entity"").  The overall vileness of the demon (including much of its spoken lines - again, as with the original) plus certain Really horrific scenes, including one involving a childbirth, may be too much for viewers whose only acquaintance with horror movies is through less brutal, less visceral fare like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Ring"" and ""The Village"" (all great pics by the way) but it's this realistic depiction of raw, uncharismatic evil (balanced nicely by the marshalling of more benign characters and brighter powers for great contrast) that makes the show so scary on multiple levels.

Sidenote/plug - a lot of Exorcist fans have seen all the movies and read the first book but the novel ""The Exorcist III: Legion"" by series creator William Peter Blatty seems less well known.  It's a great book with a lot philosophical stuff and extra weirdness that didn't all make it into the movie version, so fans might want to check it out.",1119657600,2,3626,4.919803600654665

This prequel ain't got nothing on the original, but it still offered a few thrills to get me interested. It seemed like it was incredibly long, and in the end it tries to shock you with a surprise but you really don't even care enough to notice. The characters were weak (unlike the original) and the plot was too reliant on traditional ""suspense"" moments of the horror genre. This movie could have been a lot better I think, especially when it's focused on the (fictional) spot where Lucifer fell from Heaven. The few moments of demonic possession did hold true to the original, which I give the director some credit for, though not much.

2169311,4,B00065HKL6,"I was quite prepared to be less than enthusiastic about this prequel to one of the truly immortal films of all time.  The unfortunate death of John Frankenheimer, the original director, fanned rumors that the whole production was cursed, there's a lot of talk about the original version of this prequel being abandoned by yet another director (Paul Schrader), and I heard almost no one in my circle of acquaintances discussing this film at all after its release.  The whole idea of prequels is also pretty tricky in and of itself, as even the great George Lucas has learned.  I really didn't bring too many expectations of any kind with me into Exorcist: The Beginning, and maybe that's why I was actually quite impressed by what I saw.  Stellan Skarsgard, it must be said, turns in an excellent performance as Father Merrin.  This really is an excellent film and, in my opinion, a worthy prequel to The Exorcist.

Don't go in looking for projectile vomiting and head-spinning; this is not The Exorcist.  There is a surprising amount of depth here for those willing to immerse themselves in the story.  There will be demonic special effects for all those who care only about that kind of thing, but you will have to wait a little longer than you might like to see them.  Exorcist: The Beginning is not really about Lucifer or demonic possession or even exorcism per se; this story is really about Father Merrin and how this great man of the cloth lost and then regained the faith that would later transform him into the man we all know as The Exorcist.  Humanity and faith are always more powerful themes than evil and doubt - less exciting, perhaps, but much more meaningful.

The action here takes place in 1949 in eastern Africa, where a Christian church has recently been unearthed by archaeologists - a Christian church that dates back to a time long before Christianity made its way to that part of the world.  Merrin, then an ex-priest, is charged with aiding the dig and locating an iconic sculpture of a demon's head.  The situation on the ground (which is said to be the spot where Lucifer originally fell after he was cast down from heaven) is less than ideal: local tribesmen are afraid that a great evil will emerge from the buried structure, the British army is wary of a tribal rebellion there, and decay and misery (not to mention flies and less savory insects) seem to engulf everything in the humid atmosphere.  The original leader of the expedition has been consumed by madness, a number of men have disappeared, and Merrin finds scenes of desecration inside the ancient walls of the church (including the proverbial upside-down cross of Jesus).  Soon, a local boy is taken ill after witnessing a traumatic event, begins showing signs of possible demonic possession - and then everything really starts to fall apart around Merrin.  The film may move too slowly for some viewers for the first hour, but I think the director did a wonderful job of building suspense for the showdown we all know is yet to come.  The ancient, remarkably preserved church hides many secrets of a most unsavory nature, and it is here that Merrin's lack of faith in the God he once served is eventually challenged by a manifestation of evil powerful enough to break down the formidable barriers he has placed around his tortured soul.

The reasons for Father Merrin turning his back on God and the church serve as the emotional centerpiece for all that is to come.  It is hard to imagine the Father Merrin we know from The Exorcist having ever abandoned his faith or entertained unholy thoughts, but this prequel makes clear, in the most poignant ways possible, how such a tragedy transpired.  Merrin is a man truly and justifiably haunted by his memories.  It takes a face-to-face meeting with evil incarnate for Merrin to find what he has lost in himself and in his God.  The final confrontation, which comes with something of a twist, is almost anti-climactic, largely because the job is much easier than it should be (very little of the battle is waged on psychological grounds).  The special effects are well-done, but a lot of the R rated material here seems contrived, actually taking something away from the power of the film's story of redemption lost and regained.

This is really quite a dark film, as you might expect, but more so for the psychological and human aspects of the story than for the outwardly demonic manifestations of evil.  There is a significant amount of gore and demonic symbolism in the film, but my reactions to the film were much more internal than external.  Obviously, Exorcist: The Beginning didn't deliver what many Exorcist fans expected of it but that does not make it a bad movie.

Having not seen the original Exorcist, I didn't really know what to expect. I was a little bit apprehensive, because sequels often stink, and prequels are even worse.

Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised with this prequel. It's not going to win any awards or anything, but it was actually pretty good. It was a bit predictible in places, but I, for one, didn't see the ending coming at all.

The extent of the special features, aside from the director's commentary, is an eight minute behind the scenes featurette and the original trailer. It would have been nicer if the behind the scenes featurette had been longer. It would also have been nice to see how some of the make-up effects and special effects were done.

It's overly-busy plots along with lame gorey scenes is a drag and lost a focal point of ""possession"" made so famous and striking by Linda Blair more than 20 years ago.

Stellan Skarsgard is a brilliant actor, and he's the saving grace of this weak film. His portrayal of Father Merrin is impressive. Father Merrin seeks redemption and regain his faith in God while trying to help solve the mystery and curse of the demon in Kenya. So many bizzare and creepy things happen on his mission. There's demon-possessed dogs attacking and eating a boy. A woman gave birth to a dead baby covered in insects and bugs. A troop of locals trying to perform an exorcism on a boy. Then there's the confusing relationship between the female lead Izabella Scorupuco(Sarah) and her husband whose unattractive face was about to turn rotten. All these events are not related directly to the main plot, so it's making it hard to follow it after more than half an hour.

The possessed version of Sarah didn't even looked and feel scary like Linda Blair. Her makeup and expressions were rather hideous. She only looked like Linda Blair's older sister. She even fantasized about making out with Father Merrin!?

I also noticed that Julian Wadham was in a secondary role, but with so little screen time, he's appearance is insignificant. Anyone who had seen The English Patient will remember him.

The movie was too confusing, and exasperating for the first hour, one kept expecting father Merrin to battle the demon, but none of that happened.

The Art in the film especially the cathedral was beautiful, and the casting was wonderful.

2169323,2,B00065HKL6,"Exorcist: The Beginning (Renny Harlin, 2004)

My fellow Americans, we have seen the untamed mess that is Exorcist: The Beginning, and all we can do is wonder what might have been.

Now, John Frankenheimer has not lensed a truly great film in a very long time. William Friedkin has done a bunch better, but was never actually contracted to direct. Paul Schrader's (completed!) version is rumored to be much better (and of the four directors involved, Schrader has actually done the best recent work, with 1997's Affliction), but has yet to see the light of day. One wonders why in the world the producers finally ended up going with mindless action director Renny Harlin, the high points of whose career include The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4, and Cliffhanger.

All that said, Harlin does show in here that he's capable of building atmosphere. Indeed, a good deal of the film absolutely reeks of atmosphere, and had Harlin and co. managed to keep the pace and the tension at those levels, they might have managed a film at least as good as Legion (the vastly underrated third installment in the series). However, such is not to be; Harlin is an action director at heart, and thus, bullets and blood must fly on a regular basis.

A friend of mine has a favorite expression: ""do not [censored] with the Skarsgard."" Truer words may never have been spoken, for Stellan Skarsgard is capable of bringing sublimity to almost any role he plays. (We'll make a shuddering exception for Deep Blue Sea, his previous teaming with Harlin.) Here, he plays Father Merrin, the role immortalized by Max von Sydow in the original film. Merrin, who lost his faith during the war (we find out why in a completely unnecessary repeated flashback), has turned to the twin comforts of alcohol and archaeology. He is approached by Semelier (the always-amusing Ben Cross), a dealer in antiques, to go to a dig in Africa and bring back an icon. (Interestingly, the name Pazuzu is not mentioned at any time during the film.) How Semelier and his backers know that the icon exists is never revealed. On the way down, Merrin meets Major Granville (veteran British actor Julian Wadham; American audiences will probably know him best from The English Patient) and Father Francis (Master and Commander's James D'Arcy), who accompany him to the town outside the site. In said town, he meets the rest of the ragtag crew who make up the movie's core; there's the drunk digger, Jeffries (Guy Ritchie regular Alan Ford); the town's doctor, Sarah (Izabella Scorupco, previously making the screen smolder in Reign of Fire); Chuma, the interpreter (Andrew French, recently of Beyond Borders); and Joseph (Remy Sweeney, in his first film role), son of a local muckety-muck, budding archaeologist, and the happy kid who just cries out to be possessed by Pazuzu, because, you know, that's how these things go.

The acting is an interesting mix of good and atrocious. Skarsgard is, of course, brilliant, and D'Arcy plays his role with the missionary zeal one would expect from a priest just graduated from seminary. Wadham is chilling in his standoffishness, and Sweeney is a kid who's going places. Contrast them with Ford and French, who take to their stereotypes just a bit too well, and Scorupco. I've seen blocks of wood act with more emotion than Scorupco does in this film (in fact, that icon of Pazuzu mentioned in the synopsis is one of them). The script had incredible potential; this much is obvious by the amount of it Harlan managed to get right despite his tendency to throw in action sequences whenever possible. (The final exorcism-- come on, it's not a spoiler, you know there's going to be a final exorcism-- which made the original Exorcist the classic film it is here seems like an outtake from one of the Die Hard movies.) And there are flashes where it lives up to that potential, but only flashes.

Word on the street has it that the DVD version of Schrader's version, which also stars Skarsgard, will be available on DVD sometime this summer. What good there is here makes me anticipate all the more what someone like Paul Schrader could do with the material. This version can be safely skipped, but don't go out of your way to avoid it, especially if you're a fan of Skarsgard. **",1112227200,2,4288,4.787837837837838
2169324,1,B00065HKL6,This movie was amazingly bad.  With all the FX and beautiful scenery at their disposal you would think a workable script might have been somewhere to be seen.  But no.  Quick cuts and a dull plot killed this movie. The original is still the best.,1112054400,4,246,4.4222222222222225

I had the feeling that the last parts of the movie was written within a half hour without much thought. It totally ruined the entire movie. The excorcism was totally corn right off the cob. I thought how utterly rediculous.

It had some gore here and there-a dead baby born with maggots all over it, and there was a kid that got ripped apart by these wild canines.

My gawd it was a bad movie because of the ending. If I would have paid money to watch this in the movie theatre, I would have been extremely angry to have wasted my money and time. I rented the DVD and was entirely disappointed. I felt I lost a few dollars and wasted my time watching this lame movie. If you plan to buy it - well, you were warned.",1112054400,3,824,4.14375
2169326,2,B00065HKL6,"Fifty-three minutes into the film, I realized that aside from there being a Byzantine church built in Kenya some 1500 years before Christianity came to that part of the world, I didn't know what the story was about. I thought about that for a moment, and realized that if not for the The Exorcist, I would not have had a clue as to what to expect.

Here's what I thought the movie had going for it:

* Good visual effects, although the hyenas could have used a little help from Peter Jackson's crew

* The visual effects include the stunning battleground scene in the prologue

* Excellent casting of Skarsgrd as Merrin

* Well thought out logic behind Merrin's decision to leave the church by casting him as a Catholic priest in a Nazi prison camp. ""God is not here today..."" or whatever the Nazi said before blowing a hole in the little girl's head was quite effective. If I had been a priest, it would have been difficult for me to maintain my faith after witnessing the horrors of the Holocaust.

Here are the problems I had with the film:

* While the prologue was impressive, I found it confusing. What was it supposed to represent?  Perhaps I missed something, but reading other reviews from professional critics and people here on Amazon, it seems that most people don't know what to make of that scene.

* The possession was too similar to the possession in the The Exorcist.

* The make-up of the possessed was actually worse than that in the The Exorcist. Thirty years, enormous advances in special effects, and make-up is worse?

* Too much typical horror-schlock that the The Exorcist never relied on. While you certainly don't need make Exorcist: The Beginning exactly as the original was made, certain rules were established in the original (for example, nothing happened unless it was necessary to the story), and those rules should have been employed here.

* An example of something unnecessary to the story was the gruesome birth of a baby covered in maggots. I believe it was said that the baby was stillborn, but I could be wrong. If that was said, then that was incorrect: the baby was screaming it's head off. However, my memory could be incorrect.

* Father D'Arcy left out some *extremely* crucial information. Why did he leave that out? If he hadn't there wouldn't have been a story. That's the worst kind of storytelling.

* There simply wasn't enough of a struggle between Merrin and the demon to ""setup"" the animosity that the demon feels for Merrin in The Exorcist, and Merrin's necessity in the The Exorcist.

* There was a twist in the story that didn't belong. I won't give it away, but everything about it, including Merrin searching for Sarah before entering the cave (why would he need her?) didn't add up.

* In The Exorcist, the demon was a central character of the film. In this film, it was not. We were faced with a mysterious force of evil that was never pinned down until the final sequence, the climax, and even then, without our knowledge of the original, we wouldn't have known what was happening. In the original, I *cared* for Regan, I pitied her suffering. Here, with regard to the evil, I didn't know what it was, so it was impossible to care about it. What was it? What was it trying to do?

There are movies that you see because you're generally interested in the movie. Then there are movies that you see simply because you want to have it in your mind as part of the canon of sequels and prequels. This film fell into the latter cateogory.",1111968000,5,3493,4.572115384615385

The lead in this Mr. Merrin, does a fantastic job and it was a real shame the story seems to wander around and not say much. I wouldn't say it was a wasted performance by Merrin but it certainly outclassed the writing. If you're looking for a movie better than the original... forget it, if you are looking for a movie better than Part II and III and want to learn more about Father Merrin this should be seen.

The acting is good, the atmosphere of the movie truely inspired by the original ""The Excorsist"" -and this is actually not always so ""in common"" to all the various sequels out there as a result of the moneymachine the entertainment-industry indeed is.

The positive as mentioned is the filming, acting, the locations -giving this movie the right and recognizable ""feel"" as contained the 1'st movie. The negative -well, the special effects aren't very special at all. Today you actually expect the movies to at least be stunning visually. Not here. It looks like something made in the 80's, and now I am serious! Luckily there are not many scenes that ""required"" the special treatment of computer, it's mostly psychological. The ironic thing however is that effects in this 2004-production can't be compared to the movie that was made in the early 70's! It takes away two stars, that and the horrible introduction of ""the Demon"". Were the filmakers in a hurry at the end?

A shame because of the otherwise ""worthiness"" of this fourth ""Excorsist"". It is rather creepy, it made me jump several times. But the ""presence"" of the uncovered physical evil at the end as mentioned ruins some of the famous ""feel"" that a worthy sequel requires. It's not the worst I've seen, but disappointing!

I thought it was interesting to see the 'history' of Pazuzu.  You see the small statue in the original movie but there's nothing mentioned of it.

I didn't have high expectations of this movie so I wasn't disappointed.  I actually enjoyed it.  Well.. everything but the birth scene.  Yuck.",1111622400,2,604,4.8431372549019605
2169330,2,B00065HKL6,"Perhaps much like the bulk of the reviewers here, I'm a die-hard fan of the 1973 original 'Exorcist' which contributed to many sleepless nights at my young age.  Each sequel (or, now, prequel) that has emerged has, of course, piqued my interest to witness the progression of the movie series.  Unfortunately, each subsequent movie has not lived up to the brilliance of the first release, and the newest creation ('Exorcist: The Beginning') is no exception.

I was not able to see the new release in the theaters, so I waited for the DVD, all the while avoiding specific reviews which revealed ""spoilers"" of the movie.  However, I had stumbled upon a variety of glances from time to time, most of which spat out negative reviews.  So, I prepared for the worst and expected a disaster.

Interestingly enough, I found myself actually ENJOYING the film about an hour into it!  Up to about that time, it is a well-groomed horror movie with an intriguing plot (despite the AWFUL computerized graphics - more on that later).  The idea that  an ancient church was built over, yet, another ancient church used for human sacrifice and Satanic rituals was downright cool (and scary)!  There were some highly graphic scenes, all which illustrated the hightened tension of the ""emerging evil"" eminating from the African setting.  However, the movie took a tremendous turn for the worse in the awful (shall I say, ludicrous) exorcism finale.  Dominated by bad make-up, a weak demonic voice, and disasterous CGI graphics, the exorcism scene outlines Hollywood's piss-poor attempts to frighten us with bad technology.  It was tasteless, executed poorly and didn't even really make sense in the grand scheme of the movie.

Here's the scoop, folks:  The most frightening part of the original 'Exorcist' is the ""real"" production of that movie.  All stunts were done by hand (or with string), there were no computerized graphics, no sudden ""surprise"" frights, and the most enduring feature is the lack of music throughout the entire movie - THAT's what makes it frightening.  These simple characteristics draw the movie-goers into the movie, as if it's really happening or as you're ""really there.""  Think of any major disaster in history.  Was there a big orchestra playing on TV as we watched the horror unfold on September 11th, 2001?  No, and though music plays a huge part of movies (see ""Tubular Bells"" in the original), proper timing of effects, music, etc...is all a major part of the impact.  This is a big part of what angers me about current horror movies.  Everything is based on the ""big production"" and not what the STORY is about.  As usual, this movie suffers greatly from the current ""scare-them-with-technology"" point of view.

Rumors are swirling around Exorcist fan-sites about the DVD release of Paul Schrader's 1st version of 'Exorcist: The Beginning.'  Apparently, this version is a more intellegent, more accurate depiction of the first encounter of our ol' friend Pazuzu and Father Merrin.  I'll certainly hold out to witness the release of that version.  However, any movie released with two story lines is certainly not befitted to be considered a classic (such as 'The Exorcist' itself).  Wouldn't you say?",1111449600,5,3214,5.024574669187145

I have never directed a movie, though I have written a screenplay, so I guess it is easy for me to be critical; I have no idea how hard it was to tackle this project.  But regardless of that fact, this is one of those movies that just didn't deliver the goods.

First of all, the setting was all wrong.  See, when you are talking about going to a third-world country atmosphere...well...that alone is the scary part.  The key to the success of the first film was that evil came to a young girl's bedroom - a supposed safe environment invaded by the devil.  Not so scary when the viewer sees that same evil in a place where murder, severe disease, and idol worship is an everyday thing.

Secondly, the little boy who is possessed has absolutely NO character development beforehand.  The viewer should get to know the kid first.  It would have been great if we knew more about him than that he likes rocks and is a Christian.  He needed to become someone we really cared about, and not just because he is a young boy.

Thirdly, the final battle scenes between the priest and the devil are in a cave!  That's just boring, boring, boring!  It would have been so much better to have the final fight on a moving train or in the middle of a busy hospital with horrified onlookers seeing bedpans fly around the hallways!

This movie does not deserve five stars.  I can only assume that most of the people giving this film five stars have some kind of intimate connection to this film, because there is absolutely NO WAY a completely objective reviewer would rate this flick a five star film.

I think hardcore fans read too much into the original movie and if the prequel is one iota off they gasp in horror (pun intended).  Here's what I think...  I think it was done quite well.  I couldn't expect more from a prequel.  Why?  Because if you really think about it, when evil comes back for the original movie, it's a much more intense affair.  And you can't expect a prequel to be as intense.  So, in my opinion it makes sense that the second movie would be more in-depth than the first.  I think the director found a delicate balance that may not have otherwise been achieved.  Take into consideration the actors, the excellent set and special effects.  The movie is top-notch from that standpoint.  I think people think just because this movie franchise achieved cult status that everything has to be perfect.

Moreover, when one considers the sequels to the original, this prequel, in comparison, is indeed a worthy complement.

To be sure, some of the horror, blood, and gore can be most disturbing.  But, hey, folks, its a HORROR film...it is supposed to make you recoil in disgust!!!

For one, compared to all the other horror movies that hit the big screen last year, this is really the only scary movie, next to Saw, that saved the entire year of 2004. Everything else sucked or was rated PG-13. Two, compared to the Exorcist sequels, this move stands above all of them. Unlike Exorcist 2 & 3, Exorcist: The Beginning proves to have an interestingly enough storyline that ties in very well with the first film. I just really liked the whole idea of Father Marin losing his faith after witnessing horrors of the Holocaust (""God is not here today, Priest!) and becoming an archeologist. And after he becomes an archeologist years later, he is sent to Africa to investigate a buried church dating back to 1,500 years before Christianity and is also looking for the head of a statue that is supposed to represent an ancient evil. The statue head is none other than the statue head he later uncovers again in The Exorcist. After seeing this, the beginning of the original Exorcist makes more sense, because now we are shown the history of Father Marin and the statue head. I just really liked the whole idea behind this movie overall.

Other than having a strong storyline backing it, I found this movie to be absolutely chilling throughout. There's scenes of hyenas ripping a child apart, suicides, self mutilation, a maggot covered stillborn baby, and more. This movie just absolutely pulses with the evil it tries to portray successfully. I will admit the ending was just a little weak, but this is not the kind of film that is entirely reliant on its ending. The ending didn't squandered the rest of film at all. There's nearly 2 more hours of freakier stuff to get by on before the ending.

Directed by Renny Harlin. Story by William Wisher Jr, Caleb Carr. Screenplay by Alexi Hawley.
Fourth movie released in the series.

  This is the second filmed version of this movie re-filmed with some re-casting after director Paul Schrader's first version, DOMINION: The Prequel to The Exorcist, was filmed and the studio did not like it and shelved it.
  Therefore, they hired director Renny Harlin to film the movie all over again with some cast changes and story changes. Izabella Scorupco, James D'Arcy, Ben Cross and other actors in smaller roles were added to the cast while others were replaced.

Returning for this second version: Stellan Skarsgard, Julian Wadham, Andrew French, Ralph Brown, Antonie Kamerling, Eddie Osei, Israel Oyelumade.

Stellan Skarsgard plays ""Father Lankester Merrin"", originally played by Max von Sydow in The Exorcist (1973) and Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977).

  A young priest with a rosary walks through this field of dead bodies on the ground after a battle of Crusaders had taken place.  He comes across another priest on the ground who is holding an idol of an unholy creature. Suddenly, the dead priest is actually just barely alive and grabs the terrified priest. Then the priest sees hundreds of dead men crucified upside-down on crosses as far as the eye can see.
  Now it is 1949 in Cairo, Egypt. Semelier (Ben Cross), who works for a private collector of antiquities, introduces himself to Father Mirren (Stellen Skarsgard). Mirren tells him it is just ""Mister"". Semelier wants him to uncover a church buried in South Africa. A rare object they believe is inside this Christian church. Merrin goes to the British Army Headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya to meet with Major Granville (Julian Wadham), whom will allow Mirren and Father Francis (James D'Arcy) to join the archeologist dig as his guests. Once there, Mirren arrives at the medical clinic and meets the doctor, Sarah (Izabella Scorupco).
  At the dig, they have already uncovered the dome of the church. Mirren discovers the wall of the church looks brand new for being over 50 years. But why would they bury a church after they built it?
  Mirren enters the church through a hole in the roof of the dome. It is like a temple. What they find inside is evil.

Also in the cast: Alessandro Casula, Matti Ristinen, David Bradley, Alan Ford, Remy Sweeney.

Filmed in Rome, Lazio, Italy. Casablanca, Morocco.

The audio on this film works very well. And when you realise just what they had to work with and in, and how the ""Curse"" affected film production, you just might like this film some more.

Whilst it is not of the same pedigree as the EXORCIST ( or even some of the re-edits), it still works as a fun horror piece.

Skarsgard is primo in his role, and drives the film on many levels.",1110153600,,737,4.154929577464789
2169342,3,B00065HKL6,"The movie didn't hold my attention closely enough in the beginning and later it hurt my understanding of what the heck was going on.  It was just a dull start to the movie, nothing to hook into.

And also the dialogue was awful, not enough of it, and everybody was always whispering so we couldn't hear what was being said.

Overall I would rate it better than Exorcist 2, but not as good as the original, nor the Omen and its sequels.

The star who played the lead was very good toward the end when fighting the possessed one.  I liked him very much and will look for more of his work.",1110153600,,586,4.196428571428571

2169344,3,B00065HKL6,"While I wouldn't call ""Exorcist - The Beginning"" a good movie, I will say that it is very watchable. I think the story behind the making of this film may be more compelling than the story that unfolds in front of the camera, but I still find myself popping this film in every few years, and outside of the original film, this is the ""Exorcist"" movie I've seen most often.

As the film opens see a single priest walking among the dead and wounded following a great battle. The priest seems to be the sole survivor among thousands of dead, quite a few who have been crucified upside down. Flash forward to just after World War II and we meet Lankester Merrin, a former priest who lost his faith after witnessing, and being forced to take part in Nazi cruelty during the war. Merrin is asked to investigate a Church which has been uncovered under the sands of Kenya, a Christian Church which pre-dates Christianity in the region by 500 years. Upon arrival Merrin learns that the local tribes believe the ground and church are cursed. Merrin also meets a young doctor who was held in a Nazi Concentration Camp during the war. As Merrin investigates the church, strange and unusual things begin happening to the people working on the dig, and when a young boy is torn apart, Merrin begins to suspect the church was built to keep something evil at bay, and by opening the church they have set something loose.

This is a very slow film, and oddly paced. I guess that makes sense considering this film is a patchwork version of Paul Schrader's ""Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist"". I am looking forward to watching ""Dominion"" to see where the films are similar and where they differ. The thing with ""The Beginning"" is that it's just good enough that you wish it were much better.

Stellan Skarsgrd puts in really good performance as Father Merrin, and you really wish the script were stronger just to see what he could've done with better material. The CGI is clunky, and not very good. I wish they had taken the time to use practical F/X as I get pulled out of the ""action"" pretty quickly whenever the CGI hyenas appear and during the final showdown.

Overall this is a good film, it doesn't come near the chills of the first film, or the goofy fun of the second, but I think that if you enjoyed part III, which was more of a character study, then you'll like this one too.",1110153600,,2366,4.495348837209303
2169345,3,B00065HKL6,"It has been over three decades since the controversial adaptation of William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist"" frightened movie audiences worldwide and became a historical film phenomenon to be reckoned with. Now, almost fifteen years after the second sequel to the original film,""The Exorcist III"", was released, a different new direction has been chosen for the fourth installment of the demonic series, instead of making a sequel, they opted to create a prequel explaining the origins of the character of Father Merrin, who decades later would exorcise Satan out of teenager Reagan. He went through some very interesting and traumatic experiences before encountering his first meeting with the Devil in Afica in the early 20th century.  The film was originally to be helmed by legendary classic-movie director John Frankenheimer , but he died mysteriously shortly before principal photography commenced. Liam Neeson, who was at the time cast in the leading role as Father Merrin, dropped out of the part due to the tragic death of Mr. Frankenheimer. A new director and leading star, Paul Schrader(Director of 2002's Auto Focus) and Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard(King Arthur),respectively, were hired. After filming wrapped, everything seemed to be in perfect harmony until Warner Brothers Pictures fired Paul Schrader because they thought his version of the picture was dull, boring, and lacked scares. So they shelved his cut of the movie(still hoping to release it into the public eventually) and hired yet another new director, Renny Harlin(Deep Blue Sea) to envision and create a more action-packed, gorier, and more intensely graphic motion picture as opposed to Schrader's more psychological and eerie take on the story. Almost the entire film was reshot with some different actors and the results are apparently astoundingly unlike each other. On August 20th, 2004, Harlin's cut creeped its way into theaters and was welcomed to negative critical feedback, but that did not stop the powerful force from earning the #1 box-office spot for that weekend. It is by no means the terryfing and powerfully shocking fright-machine the original was, mainly because it was mostly concerned with briefly scaring the audience with cheap scares and ludicrous gore effects, mostly showcased by uneffective-looking CGI imagery. The acting and performances are also a little stiff at times, including a romantic angle between Father Merrin and a local doctor who is baffled by the strange happenings surrounding the excavation site were ancient ruins were recently discovered. The romance was not very well deveoped, and it happened too quickly under the circumstances to be believable. But the film also has some strengths going for it, like the grim and morbid atmosphere that creeps full circle during the movie. The cinematography is also well-coordinated, and the opening sequence was memorable and impressive. Add to that some depressive and dark flashbacks, a tight and snappy pace that will assuredly never bore you, and you've got yourself a serviciable althought not entirely memorable entry in the demonic possession horror genre. Recommended for fans of the Exorcist series, loyal viewers of horror and occult movies, and adults looking for an entertaining fright flick to watch on a rainy day. Rated R for strong violence and gore, disturbing images and rituals, and for language including some sexual dialogue.",1110067200,2,3416,5.373134328358209
2169346,3,B00065HKL6,"It's said that the devil is in the details and director Renny Harlin (""Die Hard 2"", ""Cliffhanger"") gets many of the details right in this prequel to ""The Exorcist"". Although it doesn't compare to the original film (nor the third sequel directed by William Peter Blatty), ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" features a number of memorable performances and some startling imagery. While it may lack depth, the film does attempt to create something different and original from the original film and the tepid sequel that followed.  Father Merrin (Stellan Skrsgard) has buried his faith along with a terrible incident from his past. Merrin has been hired by a mysterious man named Semelier (Ben Cross in a cameo appearance) to go to a Kenyan dig. It seems that Semelier feels that Merrin's skills as an archeologist will come in handy in helping a team uncover the mystery of a church dating back a thousand years before any Christian set foot in Kenya. The area seems cursed as the original archeologist has gone insane; the area has a history of plagues and death associated with it. What Merrin uncovers exhumes his faith breathing new life into it but also shakes him to his very core. Accompanied by Father Francis (James D'Arcy) sent by the Vatican as an observer and assisted by Sarah (Izabella Scorupco) a visiting physician , Merrin must uncover the mystery at the heart of this ancient church before disaster strikes.

Featuring a stellar cast, intelligent script by first time screenwriter Alexi Hawley (based on a story by Caleb Carr author of THE ALIENIST and William Wisher co-writer of  ""Terminator 2"") and outstanding cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (""Apocalypse Now"", ""1900"", the TV adaptation of ""Dune""), Harlan's film mixes elements of an ""Indiana Jones"" style adventure film with the atmospheric horror of the original ""The Exorcist"". While the last third of the film ultimately falls apart, ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" begins with much promise and the first hour of the film seems possessed by the energy that drove William Friedkin's original classic film. Like most modern horror films, ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" has its moments of shock but Harlin also manages to generate an feeling of foreboding not unlike that which made ""Alien"" such a memorable film. Although some of the CGI effects are weak (given the film's $50 million budget and the $30 million previously spent on Paul Schrader's shelved version of this film), it's understandable that the effects involving the hyenas aren't quite as convincing as they could be. Then again, it would have behooved Morgan Creek to spent the extra money to make some of the marginal effects better looking.

The DVD release features a fine featurette that manages to skirt the conflict between Morgan Creek Productions and original director Paul Schrader (""Hardcore"" and writer of ""Taxi Driver"" & ""Raging Bull""). Harlin manages to avoid discussion of the version that Schrader directed although about 10% of this film was part of Schrader's original final cut. Evidently when Harlin was brought on board screenwriter Hawley retooled the screenplay dropping a number of characters. The reshoot meant that Harlin had to recast a key role (that of Father Francis played here by James D'Arcy but originally played by actor Gabriel Mann of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Life and Death of David Gale"") and added the character of Sarah. There is a brief mention of John Frankenheimer's involvement (he withdrew from the film just prior to his death in 2002) but nothing is discussed about how Schrader's psychological horror film compared to Harlin's more visceral horror film. Reportedly, Morgan Creek Productions will eventually release Schrader's version of the film as well (with $30 million invested in the first film one would hope so) and the two films would provide a fascinating set of bookends in a boxed set in the Exorcist Quartet. Perhaps we'll see that down the line from Warner Brothers. If so, I'm hoping they'll also remaster William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist III"" and, perhaps, include the director's cut of that film as well. We also get the creepy original theatrical trailer and a fascinating commentary from track from director Harlan.

Although it doesn't quite live up to Friedkin's 1973 classic horror film, ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" offers plenty of thrills and chills and doesn't discredit the franchise like John Boormann's disastrous ""Exorcist II: The Heretic"". Featuring an intelligent script, ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" keeps the audience involved for much of its running time although the film seems to run out of gas before the last third of the film. Harlan and his collaborators have to be given credit for trying a different tact with this prequel and focusing on the most fascinating but mysterious character from the original film. Harlan's slick direction, snappy pacing and keen visual flair keep ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" from lapsing into a predictable rehash of what's come before.",1110067200,3,4976,5.145859085290482
2169347,4,B00065HKL6,"I have to admit that I was pretty skeptical about watching this movie, and have to confess that I never liked the original Exorcist.  I always have bad reviews about these movies because they look false or don't have a real storyline, but this movie really impressed me.  Stellan Skarsgrd gives a strong performance, in my opinion, as Father Merrin, with a good supporting cast to back him up.  Though quite gory at times, the movie keeps you interested, and the end has a nice twist.

Skaarsgard does make a pretty convincing younger version of Father Merrin, some 25 years before the events in the first Exorcist, and like Father Karras, has his own crisis of faith from his WWII days as a priest in Nazi Europe.  As mentioned by others, some of the CGI effects could be better (the hyeanas, the sandstorm), but overall I did enjoy this movie and would recommend it.",1109980800,3,537,4.691489361702128
2169350,3,B00065HKL6,"""The Exorcist"" is one of the monumental horror films in cinematic history and my oldest daughter was required to be in college before I would let her watch it (what they show on television does not count because of the editing and redubbing done to William Friedkin's film).  A prequel certainly could not be any worse than the sequels that have already been perpetrated upon us (being horrified by the idea that Richard Burton would do anything for money is the only crack I will make about those twin abominations).

""The Exorcist: The Beginning"" has a couple of links to the original film.  First there is Lankester Merrin, now played by Stellan Skarsgrd as a former priest turned archeologist.  Then there is the statue of a demon that Merrin found in Iraq in the first film, which appeared behind the possessed Regan.  However, since this film is set primarily in Africa I thought this would be the story of the exorcism that Father Merrin performed that lasted months and damn near killed him.  However, that exorcism happened ten to twelve years before the events in ""The Exorcist"" and this story is set in 1949.  But then when the film shifts from its gruesome prologue showing the aftermath of the slaughter of thousands of Christian troops from the Byzantine Empire to smiths beating metal I thought for sure one of them would turn around and having a milky white eye, just like in the original.  The key point here is that those expecting anything like the original will be disappointed.

The prologue is certainly captivating and suggests that there is some connection between that event and what happens centuries later.  However, at another point in the film it is said that the location is the legendary place where Lucifer fell when he was cast out of Heaven.  Both are intriguing and potentially compatible, but you end up being able to pick and choose your interpretations for why what is happening is happening.  A Byzantine church that should not be there is uncovered in Kenya and Merrin shows up to investigate it, although he is still plagued by personal demons because of a chilling encounter with the Nazis during World War II that led him to turn his back on the Church.

Once he arrives in Kenya, Merrin meets a doctor named Sarah (Izabella Scorupco), a young priest and Father Francis (James D'Arcy).  The pair symbolizes a possible future and a troublesome past for the former priest, and when he makes his first trip inside the buried church and you start thinking this is ""Raiders of the Lost Church,"" strange things start happening and the movie degrades into a case of ""demon, demon, who's got the demon?""  Let me now enumerate this film's primary deadly sins:

1.  Stephen King once made a key distinction between horror, terror and the gross-out.  This film does not have to try and distinguish between the first two because it goes primarily for the gross-out (i.e., the baby).  In terms of horror there is nothing as effective as the film's prologue, which is not a good sign at all, and the computer-generated hyenas are laughable.  ""The Exorcist"" had the most obscene scene in the history of films and the closest thing to that in this one are the flashbacks to Merrin's choice (The movie is R for ""strong violence and gore, disturbing images and rituals, and for language including some sexual dialogue"").

2.  This film overuses misdirection, trying to get you to keep thinking ""A"" when it is really ""B.""  Confusion does not make for either horror or terror.  Even if you do not see the bait and switch coming, it does not make the exorcism any more personal for Merrin.  Either way he has strong feelings about the personal being possessed, albeit for more symbolic reasons for one over the other.

3.  The musical score by Trevor Rabin tries to reinforce the shock of every single attempt to generate a moment of horror in the film.  The results are counterproductive as the music punches moments that are standard horror film attempts to make you jump.  Yes, we all remember the use of ""Tubular Bells"" in ""The Exorcist,"" but the primarily use of sound to affect the movie audience was electronic black, not musical overkill.  Here the music is trying to do the heavy lifting to make up for the inadequacies on screen.

4.  Too much of this film is derivative of the original.  You know (or at least think you know) what is going on in this film because of what you saw in ""The Exorcist.""  This cross-applies to my two point on misdirection, but also stands as an independent reason because the more obvious the reference (or homage, if you are so inclined to be more favorably predisposed to such things) the more it simply underscores how this movie is a pale shadow of the original.

This film was originally shot by Paul Schrader (writer of ""Taxi Driver"" and the script for ""Raging Bull"") and then massively reshot by Renny Harlin (director of ""Die Hard 2,"" ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"").  Rumor has it the Schrader version will be released on DVD, which would certainly make for an interesting future double-feature.  A good film could be made about Lankaster Merrin prior to the events in Georgetown, but this 2004 film is not it.  Cinematgroapher Vittorio Storaro (an Oscar-winner for ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Last Emperor"") makes the scenes look better than they are, but that is not enough help.

The one thing I liked about the film was that when Merrin is confronted with the undeniable manifestation of evil, his faith is restored because proof of the devil is de facto proof of God.  I still remember that in the wake of ""The Exorcist"" a poll revealed that more Americans believed in the devil than believed in God.  At least Merrin learned the right lesson from his experiences.",1109894400,9,5733,4.738911290322581
2169351,3,B00065HKL6,"Exorcist:the Beginning isn't as bad as it I thought it was going to be.  Obviously, no sequel could compare to the original, and of the previous two installments one was decent (Exorcist III...it had some atmosphere) and one was an abomination (Exorcist II).  But I think E:TB manages to strike a few chords here and there and conjures up some definite chills.  The premise is interesting and I think the story isn't bad at all...

So what's my problem with it?  Well if there ever was a movie that showed signs of being a ""rush-job"" or of post-production tinkering, this is one!  In some sequences I felt I was watching a badly dubbed horror film...it is so annoying when the lips don't match the words coming out and it is very evident here.  That is inexcusable for a film with this kind of backing and budget.  Also I felt the CGI effects looked very forced and phony.  The ""possessed-look"" looked far too polished for its own good...Dick Smith's make-up in the original still is superior. There are also a bunch of needless scenes...the butterfly scene comes to mind...what, Lucifer has nothing better to do than make a butterfly crawl out of a soldier's mouth?  C'mon!  Ole Scratch has better things to do, I'm sure.  One of the biggest crimes is that Stellan Skarsgard's performance will probably be overlooked...I really must commend him on his performance...he was a perfect casting for a younger Father Merrin. The imagery and back story of the film do well to set it up as a strong prequel and in spots it did seem gripping, but the overall effect would be blown for me every time I picked up on the film's flaws...

So in final, the parts of it that hit are excellent, but the parts that miss will have you rolling your eyes a bit and wondering, ""Is Hollywood that desperate for a good director?"" I'm available.  Horror is a specialty...

Getting the director of Cliffhanger to do an Exorcist film was not smart.  Amazing how they can cast the perfect Merrin only to completely drop the ball and sign Harlin.

Instead what we have is a horrible story about a priest who left his faith. He goes to Africa as an archeologist that has been paid to find the statue of satan. Gee, think he finds his faith again? The movie looks and sounds good. That's where it ends. I couldn't wait for it to be over. There aren't even chapter stops, coming attractions, or even an original trailer on this DVD.

2169355,2,B00065HKL6,"The year is 1949 when the male protagonist, Merrin (Stellan Skarsgrd), a priest turned archeologist with a habitual drinking problem, is confronted with a situation of a newly discovered church digging in East Africa.  Father Merrin is the same priest that is performed by Max von Sydow in the original film from 1973.  In this prequel the audience gets to witness how Merrin is hired to look for an object by an antiquity firm that handles rare items.  The company believes that Merrin's lost faith will benefit their search for the item, as it will not interfere with any potential moral predicament that any other priest might possess.

Arriving at the dig site leads the audience to follow Merrin on a quest where he discovers a chained inverted crucifix and other symbols of devilish worship.  The audience is also introduced to Sarah (Izabella Scorupco), a medical doctor, and Father Francis (James D'Arcy) among other characters.  There is an immediate ambiance in the air that tells the audience that something is not right with this place, which is expected.  However, this is also where the story begins to lose some of its power as a horror film due to a number of cinematic clichs that begin to turn the wheels of the story.

The audience gets to follow Merrin investigation of the dig site, which leads him to discover a number of weird drawings in the former archeologist Bession's tent.  These drawings are very bizarre, but they also display the item that Merrin has come to retrieve.  Sarah informs Merrin that Bession is committed to St. John's Sanitarium in Nairobi, as he has turned mad.  Merrin's visit to Bession leads him closer to the dark forces that seem to be in the works, as he also receives the Roman Rituals, a book of exorcism from a priest.  Merrin denies the facts that are presented to him, as he states the all horrors of the world are man-made.

As the plot thickens, a nightmare seems to haunt Merrin, as this nightmare has roots in something that once happened to him.  The nightmare returns to him repeatedly, which also depicts what made him leave the priesthood.  This nightmare brings back memories of death and horror he once faced, as he was forced into making a difficult choice.  The nightmare is suppose to induce additional horror, but something does not seem to add up correctly, which must be because of the timing and the way it is presented.

Making horror films is a difficult art, as it requires timing, suspense, and trepidation caused through the visual imagery on the screen.  This timing must help trigger fear in the audience, as it generates a sense of being alive as the adrenaline rushes through the veins.  However, in the many attempts over the years, horror has sought different directions, as splatter and gore seems to seek its sanctuary in disgust and repulsion.  This gory horror can be seen in many new horror films, but these films do not produce the adrenaline rush that the viewers seek.  It is true that observing a severed head causes some level of internal alarm, but the head itself does not generate the anticipated fear that the audience seeks through a horror film. Horror evolves through characters' actions in regards to the situations that must generate suspense in a timely fashion, as it hopes to mesmerize the audience.  Many horror films provide this moment of fear, which keeps the audience on the edge of their seat.  Exorcist: The Beginning opens with such promise, but fails to deliver the moment of an adrenaline thrust through the veins.",1109808000,,3531,4.8

2169357,3,B00065HKL6,"Like so many big studio releases, this film had a lot of weaknesses that needn't have been. I really liked the overall feel of it, for one, as well as the cinematography. The plot device of a Byzantine church found in the middle of Kenya, inexplicably buried, was quite nice, drew me in and held my attention (yes, Christianity *does* have a legacy originating in places other than Rome!). Also, while I'm usually a purist, I liked the plot twist at the end, it didn't bother me that it went against the original storyline detail. What did bother me was the overuse of CGI effects. It seems that they even used it on the face of the possessed! The WWII flashbacks were unconvincing and 1 dimensional to me. And the complete half-assed research consistently annoyed me! They take the time to recreate a Greek Orthodox, Byzantine church, complete with mosaics. But they place an apparently northern European, Roman Catholic monk in the beginning with the decimated Byzantine army. (Although, truth be told, ""Exorcist: the Heretic"" was *the worst* in terms of half assed research. I was offended and I'm not even Ethiopian Orthdox!) And in terms of the exorcism, c'mon, it doesnt take much work to figure out the Roman Ritual; I found ""Lost Souls"" to be more accurate.

But, I will stop complaining. There were several examples of fine acting, particularly Stellan Skarsgrd and Izabella Scorupco. And I was sufficiently creeped out, and there were a few jumpy parts. A worthy successor to the first film, and unfortunately, it shares a few of its weaknesses.

And when most of the negative comments mentioned comparisions to the original 1973 film I had to laugh. The Exorcist (73) is arguably to scariest film of all time. So if you didn't leave your expectations at the door when viewing ""Exorcist - The Beginning"" you only have yourself to blame.

I just wanted to be entertained & scared while watching this film and I was. This is a true horror film, people. All these so called ""horror"" films coming out in droves lately are not truly horror films. They are creepy & have parts where you may or may not jump but this sensation leaves you once you exit the theater or press stop on your DVD player. The Exorcist - The Beginning stays with you. It's a thinking man's horror film.

Perhaps most film goers have become too jaded to appreciate a film like this and that's too bad.

This film slowly builds & builds until the final showdown (which was just absolutely freaky). I refuse to make any comparisions with the original because it would be pointless.

If you like horror movies - I mean really like horror movies and you like to be scared then I recommend you checking this one out.

I'd also like to add that I never thought there was a place for CGI in an Exorcist film but I thought it worked rather well. Some of the more terrifying scenes might have lost some edge without it.

SPOILER OR SORTS BELOW:

Okay, just one more thing. A previous reviewer complained about the story change regarding the exorcism. I'm sorry, but if they would've went with the little african boy it just wouldn't have worked (on film) and probably couldn't be done anyways in these more ""sensitive"" times. And having the female lead the possessed made for a better battle - fighting over the little boy instead of fighting the demon inside the little boy. If the kid was possessed it would've looked kinda funny. Like, oh lookit lil satan runnin around on stubby legs!",1109721600,2,2037,4.519021739130435
2169360,3,B00065HKL6,"I'm glad to see that I wasn't the only one who noticed that they changed the story around. I remember them specifically saying that Father Merrin's first account with exorcism centered around a small african boy. Now, decades later they wanna change the story. I guess they did it for shock value, but they failed at it miserably. I won't say that I hated it, but it could've been better. There were some scenes that can make you a little jumpy or excited, but nothing really over the top scary. I wouldn't buy it though. I watched it once, and that was good enough.",1109548800,,566,4.451923076923077

8038940,2,B00065HKL6,"I MUST begin by saying that I am NOT judging this film based on Friedkin's film.

The whole feel of this film was NOT imposing.  There was no sense of horror,  at all.

The actors were fair enough,  they delivered their lines with enough talent.

I was overtly UN-IMPRESSED with this film,  as a whole.

What I did enjoy:  the commentary by Renny Harlin.  I truly appreciate his attempt to RUSH this film.  10 months to pre/film/post is a daunting task,  I would imagine.

I disagree with some of his choices.  He goes on and on about the cinematographer,  Vittorio Storaro.  The look of the film was just ""fake"" the sets were ""cheap looking"" and the lighting was just awful.  Admittedly,  Harlin had a LOW budget and time constraints.  He should have made the film WAY more simplistic in terms of script and story.  In doing so,  this would have simplified the setting and created a more realistic environment and feel.  He should have also avoided CGI all-together.

""Lankaster Merrin"" seemed like an ""Indiana Jones"" wanna-be with a HUGE chip on his shoulder.  We get it,  he's conflicted over his faith.  PLEASE! This story line has been beat-to-death.  Blattty's ""Merrin"" was written as a GREAT man of faith and this backstory just does NOT jive with the character.

Terrible film,  all around.",1490486400,,1298,4.7207207207207205
8038941,3,B00065HKL6,"Many thanks to  MovieMars for their excellent service!!  We anxiously waited for this DVD to arrive. It arrived yesterday.  The movie was very disappointing with unnecessary scenes etc. It did not meet the expectations of a Stellan Skarsgard movie which usually are very good.  He seemed ill at ease all through the movie. Though it did set the pace for the events shown in the  original The Exorcist, it was  no patch on the  original.
This review pertains only to the movie and not to the Seller.",1478044800,,498,4.655172413793103
