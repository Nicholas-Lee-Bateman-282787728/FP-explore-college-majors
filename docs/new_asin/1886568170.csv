201968,5,1886568170,"Whether you have a good marriage wanting to get better or a terrible marriage hanging on by a thread, this series will give you hope and breathe life into your marriage again.  It is truly one of the best marriage DVD's I've seen.  Paul David Tripp is Right On in his approach, and he is very interesting to listen to, as well.  You won't regret this purchase.  God bless you for working on your most important relationship on earth!!!",1330646400,4,435,4.468354430379747
201969,5,1886568170,"Really exceptional DVD series about how two sinners, living in a fallen world, surrounded by more sinners can have a marriage that is both joyful and honoring to the Lord. Tripp is extremely funny and is often able to make complicated points using work pictures or demonstrations.

If you are a huge fan of Paul Trip's style and past work, you will find many repetitive illustrations so don't hope for all new content. There is (some but not a ton) of overlap between this material and Instruments in the Redeemer's Hands, Relationships a Mess Worth Making and Quest for More.

Even with the overlap, this is enjoyable to watch and extremely helpful. Almost everyone I have met who wasn't familiar with Paul found the material exceptionally helpful, and I am benefiting even watching/leading the discussion a second time.",1302393600,8,821,4.942028985507246
201970,5,1886568170,"I have read several books, attended several conferences, and even taught a few different marriage courses and this is by far the best marriage tool I have come across.  The difference between this one and the rest?  Simple, the others mostly take aim at the sinful behaviors and the need to change them (thank you BF Skinner), while Dr. Tripp uses the Bible in a masterful, straightforward, and entertaining way; taking aim at the heart, and our own self-love and ""Me-centered"" kingdoms.  The course glorfies God and is based on the Scriptures as opposed to integrational, ""psycho-based"" Christian counseling.",1272499200,18,609,5.1313131313131315
7800896,5,1886568170,"We are watching this with our small group while reading the book -- the book and DVD complement each other well and are not exactly the same. Each session is the perfect length and Paul Tripp is a very engaging speaker with excellent, gospel-centered teaching on marriage. The book and talks have made a big impact on my husband and me and our marriage is better because of it. I'm thankful for Tripp's teaching and would recommend to any Christian couple!",1465344000,2,456,4.6419753086419755
7800897,5,1886568170,"Best biblical based marriage counseling EVER!!!!!  Would and have already recommended this to everyone/anyone who wants to improve every relationship you have, not just with your spouse.",1458086400,,186,5.888888888888889

7800899,2,1886568170,"Tripp spends most of the time talking about how sinful we are. Now, I have completed four sessions. I have six left. But, there isn't enough material on putting on Christ, the fruits of the Spirit, etc. I need more material on what to embrace. It has been four weeks of what to lay off.",1413936000,2,286,4.218181818181818

7800901,5,1886568170,"I have personally viewed this many times, and each time I am helped more to see God's way is the best way as I go through marriage.  This DVD is extremely practical as Paul Tripp is real, up close and personal regarding his own marriage! I just purchased this for a wedding gift!!",1401753600,,280,4.283018867924528
7800902,4,1886568170,This is a great addition to any marriage. The truths revealed through God's Word are spoken very clearly by Paul Tripp. This is a must for keeping your marriage healthy,1389052800,,168,4.633333333333334
7800903,5,1886568170,"this is the most biblical and thorough resource on marriage that I have come across, getting to the heart of the issue, our heart, rather than focusing on mere behavior and other symptoms of sin.  EVERY young couple (and old) should watch this.  We use it in our premarital counseling program.",1376006400,2,293,4.7254901960784315
7800904,5,1886568170,"This is a good study for all relationships.  We are watching it as a couple and are studying it in our home group and have bought it for others.  David Paul Tripp has a way of expressing profound truths in a way that every age and gender ""gets it.""  I would highly recommend this for families, couples and everyone.",1374969600,,315,4.305084745762712
7800905,5,1886568170,"Oh my goodness, I can't tell you how amazing Paul Tripp is! My fiance and I went through this series together and TALK ABOUT A GROWING EXPERIENCE! We cried through parts, and it helped to opened our eyes in areas where we have fallen short. I would totally recommend this to ANY married couple, dating or engaged couple. heck, even those who WANT to get married one day should watch this. totally worth every cent. My now husband and I have agreed to try and watch this series once a year.
This series would be especially beneficial to struggling marriages, or relationships.",1357776000,2,575,4.647058823529412
