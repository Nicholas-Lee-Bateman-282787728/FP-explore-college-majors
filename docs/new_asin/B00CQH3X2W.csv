8585037,5,B00CQH3X2W,"This is a nice set for someone who wants to be reminded of retro cartoons without having to sit through an entire series of them. You get one of Clutch Cargo (Air Race) and one episode Space Angel (Visitor from Outer Space). The titles for the Colonel Bleep cartoons are The Ingenious Invention,Exposed,The Ghastly Ghost,Test Of Friendship, and Satellite of Death. The Superman cartoons you get are, TheMad Scientist, The Mechanical Monsters, The Arctic Giant, and Billion Dollar Limited. It's fun if you're over 40!",1368230400,,516,5.08235294117647
