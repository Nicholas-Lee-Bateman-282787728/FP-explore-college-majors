1787059,5,B00006OPKF,"Excellent tape. Highly recommend for anyone who has the basic understanding of Pilates workouts. You can enjoy ~25 minutes of uninterrupted pilates workout to excellent background music. I love it and and have so much fun rolling, stretching and bending to music. Now I am so flexible that I sometimes show off my flexibility skills in front of my friends. You will have a rock hard mid-section in no time. Do yourself a favor and buy this tape. I have told all my friends about this. I love everyting about the tape and so will you.",1102377600,7,533,4.5625
1787060,5,B00006OPKF,"I have 4 pilates videos now and this is by far my favorite. The fact that a full pilates workout is condensed nicely into 20 minutes is fantastic. The instructor saves time by not talking or breaking between exercises during the first run through, and there is just music. If you want detailed instruction there is a second part that goes through the whole routine and explains everything very well. The routine continues to be challenging, but wasn't overly difficult to get started with when I was not in my best shape. I actually look forward to doing this every day instead of having to force myself into it. I highly recommend this video.",1101859200,3,643,4.649122807017544
1787061,5,B00006OPKF,"I bought this DVD after reading everyone else's reviews. I found it challenging at first and extremely fats, since this was my first time trying Pilates. The second section guides you through the whole 20 minute first section of the DVD. Diedre is very pleasant and explains everything thoroughly. I find it to be a great workout for any fitness level. Recommend it highly.",1095984000,4,373,4.84375
1787062,5,B00006OPKF,"I started doing Pilates about three months ago (in addition to my regular yoga and jogging), and got this DVD in a quest for variety after I got bored with the good, but VERY slow paced, intro Pilates discs I had. This routine could be called ""speed Pilates"" and I love it!

 This disc is divided into two sections: a non-stop :20 routine (no instruction, just music and title cues), followed by a detailed run-through with complete instructions for each exercise. The quality of instruction is excellent, and I picked up some good tips that were missing from the other (big-name) Pilates tapes I have.

 I do think this workout can be appropriate for beginners if they start by following the detailed instructions section until they have mastered the basic moves, and don't try to do the non-stop routine right away (and maybe skip a couple of the more challenging moves until they build strength and flexibility). Do what you can, and respect where your body is at, and you'll improve faster than you expect!

 It's also important for beginners (and experienced) to remember that Pilates is all about CONTROL and PRECISION. In the non-stop routine, Niedra does the moves quite quickly. Don't expect to be able to match her pace right away. It's better to do 5 reps with control and precision in the time she does 10, than to rush trying to keep up and get sloppy. The more attention you pay to form, the better your results will be, and soon you'll be moving at a nice tempo right along with Niedra.

 As for RESULTS: I challenged myself to do this routine every morning for 40 days. It's day 38 today, and I definitely see a difference; my honey says I look ""sleeker"" in the hips and thighs. I've lost 2 pounds (without giving up chocolate, wine, or cheese!!) and look like I've lost 5. My waist, abs, and hips are all down an inch, and I've lost a half-inch or so from my thighs and have better muscle tone. My butt is firmer, and even though I've been doing yoga for years, my flexibility is a little better. Since I was in okay shape when I started, I didn't expect to see this much improvement in 5-1/2 weeks.

 What I'm most thrilled about is that I'm trimming down without bulking up. I gave up doing free-weight workouts years ago, because my muscles got too big. I didn't care that it was muscle, not fat; I wanted slimmer, not bigger! This workout is delivering the strong, stretched, firm, toned, sleek thighs and mid-section that I had feared (at age 45) I would never enjoy again. Thanks Niedra! I'm a ""speed Pilates"" fan for life!",1090540800,16,2546,4.5514223194748356
1787063,5,B00006OPKF,"I wouldn't consider this a beginners video. It is challenging, especially because there are no pauses between excercises! Niadra is a great instructor. I love her style, very unique (altough her fiery red hair, her glitzy workout clothes and her bracelet are a bit distracting at times!), and she does take time to explain you each exercise and how to do variations for begginers/ intermediate / advanced levels. Niadra has a killer body! I have several Pilates / Yoga videos, and altough all of the instructors have fit/slim physiques, I think Niadra looks the best.
The production is quite simple, no elaborate sets or lights or decorations. Just Niadra and her mat. But the workout and her instruction overcompensate for this. I would recommend this video for somebody who wants to make their daily Pilates video more challenging.",1080259200,3,833,5.043478260869565
1787064,5,B00006OPKF,"I really enjoy this DVD. I've been into yoga for a while and do aerial circus training once a week. Pilates has always been of interest to me, and I finally got this DVD and gave it a shot. The instructional segment is about 45 minutes long and perfect for beginners, I have back and hip problems but was able to do the moves smoothly within 3 sessions. After a week and a half or so, I switched to the routine and still find myself challenged 3 weeks later. I also got another DVD which is segmented into beginning, intermediate and advanced, and was pleased to find that there are some 'advanced' exercises included in this workout! I doubt I will ever outgrow the routine, though I'm about to the point where I am going to put my own music on.",1077321600,8,746,4.297872340425532
7972320,5,B00006OPKF,"This is my latest addition to my small collection of Pilates DVDs.  I found the workout very challenging in certain sections.  Like other reviewers, I also appreciate the fact that it's an intense yet short exercise program (something I can do every day.)  I really like the instructional part of the DVD.  Niedra explains proper technique and control.  Almost as important (in my opinion) is that she provides exercise modifications for people who may have injuries or aren't super flexible.  I'm really not that flexible (yet!) so I appreciate the modifications.  Awesome work Niedra!",1295568000,,586,5.170212765957447
7972321,5,B00006OPKF,"This is a great 20min workout with optional instructional session that's about 40 minutes. The background is boring, in the instructional session the instructor is informative but could present better- get's irrtitating ""the next move is"" is repeated over and over. However there is no talking during the actual 20min workout- keeps you moving and focused, great one to mix in during the week when low on time- I love doing it after work.",1231718400,,438,4.9324324324324325
7972322,5,B00006OPKF,"I honestly could not believe some of the negative reviews posted about this DVD.  Do yourself a favor and ignore them cause it's the best Pilates at home workout DVD on the market.  I travel a lot and don't have a DVD player in my hotel room, so I plop it into my laptop and follow the routine each morning.  After a while you'll learn them by heart and don't need to look at the screen.  Now I don't even need the DVD cause I know the routine and what works best for me.  The instruction portion is great for beginners and the other portion without instruction (just her going through each exercise, one after the other) is great for intermediate or advanced level.  I tried some other DVD's and hated them all.  They are way too slow and had nothing new to offer.  This DVD is the complete Pilates.  You need nothing else.",1182729600,,824,4.298701298701299
7972323,2,B00006OPKF,"This sounded like such a good idea - one routine with instruction, and one without.  But it doesn't really work.  First of all, the routine with instruction isn't a routine.  She shows things, then explains them, and it's too jerky to get a proper workout, in my opinion.  Whereas say with Stott, she explains as you're working out, and you get your session.

The section without instruction is also badly done, in my opinion.  The names flash on the screen, and that's it.  which means you should be looking at the screen - what's up with that?  We are meant to keep our head and neck in a very specific position in pilates, and craning to look at a screen is not on.  It would have been better if the names were read out - like in Rodney Yee's Yoga for Energy.  Personally I would have liked the names of the exercises followed by the counting of reps.

Lastly, her form is sometimes brilliant and sometimes incredibly bad.  For instance, in the leg circles, her opposing hip is swinging wildly - anyone who understands pilates will know this is a big nono.  Same with the Neck Pull Front - when she hoists herself up, her feet come off the floor - every time.

Anyway, I don't recommend.  Pity",1129593600,5,1196,4.422018348623853
7972324,5,B00006OPKF,"This is a great workout for someone who has already had some exposure to pilates.  Someone who is completely new to pilates may have to watch and then practice the instructional part of the DVD (40 minutes) before they are ready to try the actual workout section (20 minutes).  But I still think someone who is new to pilates, but in fairly good physical condition could use this DVD.  She does explain and demonstrate variations during the instructional part of the DVD, but doesn't use them during the actual workout, so you just have to remember them, if you need them.

Other pilates videos I've used took too long with the instruction and moved too slow through the routine.  I LOVE that this DVD separates the instruction from the actual routine.  Once you know the different exercises and how to do them, you can simply do the routine, 20 minutes, and move on with your day!  You can also use the menu to look at instruction for each individual exercise if you need to review just a few of them.

I have four children; the baby is just two months old.  Once my ab separation was healed I started doing this DVD and I am already feeling energetic, strong and fit.  If you do have children, make sure you do some research and check for an ab separation before you do the video, as some of the exercises could aggravate an ab separation and make it worse.  I wish someone had told me that after baby #3, or #1 for that matter!

The DVD does have a new age flavor to it, and Niedra's outfit is a bit interesting.  The music is, again, a little interesting but it doesn't distract or bother me.  These are very minor points anyway compared with the great workout you get!  I love this DVD and would recommend it to most anyone.",1116547200,5,1729,4.410094637223975
7972325,3,B00006OPKF,"Pilates is about precision, and until you're an expert, you should not attempt to do it quickly. Unfortunately, half of this DVD is the instructor cruising through the entire Pilates routine at light speed. The other half is her step-by-step instruction of the routine, also at light speed. It's too fast to allow you to really focus on the movements and get the most out of the workout. I own a dozen pilates videos, and this was the worst because I was so busy trying to keep up with the instructor (even though I would consider myself an intermediate, so I know the basic moves), that I couldn't attend to my form. Yuck. I was glad my copy skipped so I could return it!",1110412800,3,672,4.42741935483871
7972326,5,B00006OPKF,"If you are completely new to Pilates, I would still recommend Pilates for Dummies - this one might be too difficult for you. But for other Pilates beginners or intermediaters, this video is really among the best I have seen. I should know - I own a good chunk of the Pilates DVD out there. The DVD is free of the useless promotions and extra features, it's simple and to the point. The instructor is a bit new age; some users might see her colorful outfit and bracelet as a distraction. But if you can get past that, she gives you a solid workout with concise instructions. I particularly liked how she demonstrates different approaches to the workout for users with different levels of flexibilities. It will be difficult to outgrow this DVD and get bored with it. I highly recommend you to give it a try if you are serious about Pilates or getting fit.",1109289600,7,854,4.480769230769231
7972327,5,B00006OPKF,"This is the best pilates dvd I own. I got several - including pilates for dummies - to get started. This one explains the technique the best and allows easy movement among all the different exercises in part 2 instructions. I had never done pilates and found I could not learn by doing the movements while watching the instruction. With this DVD, I sat and watched several movements and day and slowing learned all of them. I don't think I would have stuck to learning the movements if not for this DVD. Worth the money.",1105142400,6,520,4.484210526315789
7972328,1,B00006OPKF,"I do not like the format of the DVD at all.  I had taken several Pilates classes before buying this DVD, but I found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end.  Much of Pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times, so with no reminder of what I should be doing in each pose I felt like I was being cheated out of a workout.  I don't think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form, so this DVD will be stored away while I learn the specifics of Pilates elsewhere.",1104192000,2,590,4.157894736842105
7972329,5,B00006OPKF,"I started with Winsor pilates, which is great but sloooow[...]  Winsor moves through the moves with a lot of detail and explanation.  But FIT CHIC is awesome!  There are two parts to this video, the first is the routine which is done with no breaks. She moves from one exercise to the next like a dance, following her choreography.  It is a great intense, twenty minute workout.  Afterward, is the instruction bit, where she explains all the moves, how they should be done, and number of repetitions. It can be intimidating because there are no breaks, and she moves relatively fast but if you want a challenge, and are familiar with pilates, this is a good one.",1102550400,5,662,4.6239316239316235
