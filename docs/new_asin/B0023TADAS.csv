8350003,1,B0023TADAS,"First, let me briefly discuss the movies themselves. Of the four, only ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" is the really bad one. This was one of the ""talkies"" Buster Keaton made after his contract was sold to M-G-M in 1928, and Keaton was the first to disavow the movie's quality. Its main virtue is that much of it was filmed at Keaton's mansion of the time, the famed Italian Villa, so you get a good look at his living quarters.

The three short subjects are not his greatest silent work but are mostly pretty funny. ""Convict 13"" has an escaped convict trade his prison garb with a briefly unconscious Buster, forcing Buster into prison life. ""The Love Nest,"" Keaton's final silent short, has Buster more or less shanghaied to work for a nasty boat captain (Joe Roberts). The best of the trio is ""Neighbors,"" a ""Romeo and Juliet in the slums"" with Buster pining for the girl across the apartment yard. It's funny throughout and has a finale that is eye-popping in its stunt work.

Now, here's the main reason I'm writing this review. I'm the webmaster of a site named ""Not the Keaton Society."" I started this site after being publicly flayed for posting Keaton films on YouTube that have been labeled, all over the Internet, as public domain. Trouble is, the versions I was posting were actually the re-mastered versions of the films that came out in 1995, and those movies are copyrighted.

Since then, I've made it a point to warn people that, just because a movie is an old silent Buster Keaton flick, that doesn't make it automatically public domain. If you visit my site (NotTheKeatonSociety.com), I have an entire page devoted to ways you can tell whether or not a particular movie is PD. Having been stung myself over this issue, I want to warn people about it so they don't get into any possible legal hassle.

I mention all of this because I bought this ""Keaton Collection"" in the belief that the movies on this 2-disc set where indeed the public-domain versions. Sadly, I've watched all of them, only to discover that they are the *re-mastered versions* released in the 1995 DVD set ""The Art of Buster Keaton"" (Kino Video). This means that whoever is putting out this collection is violating copyright law by making money for himself off the re-mastered Kino versions. (This bootlegger didn't even bother to replace the re-mastered films' soundtracks, one of the elements that qualifies these new versions for fresh copyrights.)

I highly advise you not to be a party to this bootlegging process and making yourself an innocent accessory to the crime. You can find the genuine re-mastered versions elsewhere at Amazon.com for prices that are just as reasonable.

The movies themselves are very funny, though.",1322092800,4,2713,4.7987152034261245
