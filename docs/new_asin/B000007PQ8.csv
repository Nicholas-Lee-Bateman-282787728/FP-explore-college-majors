1196658,5,B000007PQ8,"Martha Scott is barely remembered today and even more rarely mentioned when movie buffs talk about their favorite classic film stars. She was something quite special, however, and in this adaption of Bess Streeter Aldrich's novel ""Miss Bishop"" she had her shining moment. Tay Garnett was the helmsman for this wonderful film full of warmth and sentiment, spanning decades in the life of a small town teacher. Despite its scope, there is an intimate feel because of Scott's beautiful restrained performance as the pretty Miss Bishop.

Martha Scott is unforgettable as the young Ella Bishop, full of dreams and enthusiasm for learning. She is the prettiest girl in the new college, Midwestern, and could easily marry the one constant in her life, Sam (William Gargan), if she did not love him so as a friend. When she is part of the first graduating class at Midwestern she sends out many enthusiastic teaching inquiries so she can leave Old River and see life.

But when no responses are forthcoming, she is offered a job teaching freshman english by Professor Corcoran (Edmund Gwenn) at her beloved Midwestern. Ella is young and filled with joy at the prospect of teaching at the very school she has so much affection for, and knows she has many years to marry and see the world. She goes to bat for her students like no other teacher and impacts their lives in a way she will only discover decades later.

Sam remains a constant in her life but she is swept off her feet by someone else and prepares for her wedding with glee, as everything begins to fall into place as it should. But her younger sister Amy is brash and jealous of her beau and sets out to steal him. He is weak and ends up going away with Amy instead but will leave her because there is no real love there. Amy returns home in shame and about to give birth seeking her sister's forgiveness.

Though it is not the family she had dreamed of, Ella raises Amy's baby as her own child when Amy dies giving birth to the baby girl Ella will name Hope. Ella meets and has a romance with the true love of her life, Professor Stevens, as she becomes more and more involved with her teaching. Ella becomes as much a part of Midwestern as the ground it is built on. Their love is real but he is married and his wife refuses to divorce him.

Their deep love is put to the test when he asks Ella to go with him to romantic Italy. Ella knows there can be no family in such an illicit affair and does not want to sully the memory of their love with it. Only many years later will her heart truly be broken when the slim hope of their love is permanently crushed by tragedy.

Lovely Marsha Hunt is Ella's girl Hope. She is the one who will wear the wedding dress meant for Ella in a touching moment. Years later Ella will advise Hope's daughter Gretchen when she has the same choice to make as Ella had concerning a married man. Thanks to Ella, Gretchen will make the right decision and find a true love meant for her as Ella could not.

Ella weathers the changes in her beloved Midwestern and the world itself over the years as she sees WWI and the horseless carriage come to pass. There is love of friends and family but still the bittersweet knowledge of a hope chest full but never used in this warm and wonderful film.

Martha Scott is this entire film, and the sweet and sentimental atmosphere flourishes due to her underplayed performance. I suspect every teacher will love this film, especially those involved with a school which is more than just a building.

The quality of the print used for this Alpha video is very good. The Oscar nominated score from Edward Ward, however, does not sound as good but will do so you can see this heartwarming film at an inexpensive price.

Martha Scott may not be spoken of much today, but will always be remebered by you once you see Cheers for Miss Bishop.",1116374400,40,3856,4.456737588652483

1196660,4,B000007PQ8,"""Cheers For Miss Bishop"" is one of those undiscovered classics that have virtually been ignored.  This film has much of the sentimental flavor of Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life""--which was also  ignored for decades before another generation came along and  ""discovered"" it. Martha Scott's portrayal of Miss Ella Bishop, the  spinster college professor who's eternally unlucky at love, is a thoroughly  convincing performance.  She is surrounded by a great cast of character  actors.  The ending is a bit schmaltsy, but satisfying nonetheless.

1196696,4,B000007PQ8,"This is an old fashioned, heartwarming black and movie about Ella Bishop, a young woman who goes to colleges and becomes a teacher of freshman English at that very same college.

Meanwhile, she lives her life, never marrying, though she has a couple of failed romances. Through it all, she is sustained by Sam, her best friend, who would have married her had she given him the opportunity.

1196781,4,B000007PQ8,"Director Tay Garnett's CHEERS FOR MISS BISHOP (1941) is a finely-crafted costume melodrama with Martha Scott, Edward Gargan, Edmund Gwenn and Sterling Holloway (as a heavily-accented Swedish yardsman). Also with Sidney Blackmer, Marsha Hunt, Rosemary DeCamp (in her film debut), John Archer, Jack Mulhall, Pierre Watkin and John Hamilton.

It's a rare opportunity for Gargan to co-star, also many consider this Scott's best performance.
The story unfolds over 50-plus years as Ella Bishop goes from a young miss to an old maid.
After graduating from Midwestern College, she's hired to teach Freshman English there. Ultimately Ella devotes the rest of her life to her students, ""green ears of corn"" as college president Corcoran (Gwenn) describes them.

Ella's personal life is often sad. Sam Peters, the local grocer, would like to marry her but Ella's affection for him is that of a best friend.

The man she does get engaged to is stolen away by Ella's cousin Amy. The newlyweds leave town, but a year later Amy returns, alone, abandoned and pregnant. She dies in childbirth and Ella raises Amy's daughter, Hope.

Next Ella falls for a fellow professor who's unhappily married to a woman that won't grant him a divorce, so for propriety's sake Ella breaks off with him. She's later shocked to learn that he's been killed in a train accident. She goes on alone, with Sam always nearby, a constant support through life's tribulations.

In the early 1930s and now in her 70s, she is forced to retire. The original Midwestern building is about to be razed for a modern one. Ella is honoree at a banquet with hundreds of her former students in attendance. So many have become prominent professionals: a Nobel prize-winning astronomer, a US senator, an historian, etc., all who laud her influence when they were so young. Throughout this touching ceremony, Sam is there, and the film ends with them alone, repeating words they'd spoken so many years earlier.",1396569600,2,1954,5.0

Miss Bishop is a charming and somewhat sad story.

Bishop is a delightful young woman; educated, enthusiastic, kind, and inspiring. She has a couple of big romances but remains single all her days.

Sam is a wonderful man with a lifelong love for her but he is content to be her good friend, until his last day if need be, in the hopes that she will finally love him and be his.

She spends her life teaching English at a small college, (where she herself got her education) and is very well loved by the students.

1196813,5,B000007PQ8,"Making high-quality movies with integrity like this one would seem right up a world-changing mogul's alley (I'm talking YOU, Oprah!)---because movies are an influence. This particular movie is a goodhearted WELCOMED influence.  Moreover, it honors the intelligence of the audience.

All through the movie, ""Miss Bishop"" maintained self-respecting boundaries (which are different than rigid boundaries, because they're creatively adaptive).  One good example of her self-honoring boundaries was the non-judgmental relationship advice she gave to her great-niece.  Despite unexpected life-changing disappointments, Miss Bishop bore those hardships with grace, moving directly ahead with her life and responsibilities, and refusing to live in the past.

Miss Bishop was also amazingly forgiving.  A good example of her unassailable mercy and kindness was shown several decades later, when her great-great-niece inquired, and Miss Bishop still didn't reveal the reason for owning a wedding gown.  Another admirable quality of hers was that she wasn't too proud to adapt to changes.  Her lifelong best friend seemed to share many of her character qualities, and so it thus made sense that she never stopped supporting that friendship.

The depth of the story line was satisfying, unfolding over several generations, and always  believable.  As for the setting, it was enjoyable to see how the late 1800's era was depicted, and as portrayed, it was charming.

Oprah--or any media figure who wants the world to be a better place!--the world would welcome movies which include the features of this film: a clean story line (free of product placement and/or mindless destruction), highly skilled actors (as versus mere ""big name stars""), characters worth caring about (because they don't defile the term ""human""), self-effacing humor, authentic & well-crafted drama (that never stoops to exploitation), an ethos of integrity (that doesn't slide to the lowest common denominator), and a pace that doesn't assault the senses.

Martha Scott's  protrayal of the life of a teacher from first job through retirement is perfect. Her young enthusiastic teacher on her first day is spot on and every encounter with students and administration rings so true.  It isn't until the very end that she has a chance to see that she has truly ""made a difference"" in the lives of people.  I love this movie!",1245715200,5,497,4.417582417582418
1196827,5,B000007PQ8,"Martha Scott is a revelation in the title role of ""Cheers for Miss Bishop"".  I have only seen Scott as the senior nun in 1975's disaster epic ""Airport 1975"", and I had no idea she was such a talent.  You couldn't really tell from her role in ""Airport 1975"" - it was only a small role, and she was overshadowed by Helen Reddy's singing nun.
In ""Cheers for Miss Bishop"", Scott plays her role from a teenager until she is an old woman, and is never unconvincing for a second.  She owns this movie, and brings such heart and pathos and range to her performance that one can only stand in awe of her skills.  Everyone else is good, but they are merely there to support Scott.  The script is touchingly written, and the sets, music, costumes, and every other aspect of the film are just as they should be.  Definitely for fans of Martha Scott, and for anyone else who is in the mood to discover a forgotten treasure.  Readily available from Alpha Video (through oldies.com)in a nicely-packaged, very affordable version, at only $5.95 plus shipping.",1241740800,6,1042,4.540106951871658
1196828,5,B000007PQ8,"I bought the DVD of this movie primarily as an exercise in nostalgia. It was a mainstay on local Los Angeles television, enabling channels in the early 1950's to stay on the air until their sign-off time of 10pm or so by showing it repeatedly. All told, as a child I must have seen it close to 100 times.

To my surprise, it holds up remarkably well as romantic melodrama. Martha Scott and William Gargan give affecting performances, as do the various actors playing the wide assortment of students influenced through the years by Miss Bishop of Midwestern, a woman unlucky in love, but blessed in her career. If the film has a weakness, I would say it's in the performance of Mary Anderson, whose winking and blinking as a hormonally overactive teen is almost laughably over the top. But this is a minor flaw, one which does not appreciably interfere with the pleasure of seeing this film once again after so many years.",1174608000,2,921,4.615853658536586
1196829,5,B000007PQ8,"This movie is a rarity for people interested in realistic human dramas.  The values of integrity and determination to succeed will seem incomprehensible to viewers under 35, but older viewers will find it refreshing to remember a time when such attitudes were commonplace.

Martha Scott's performance is impressive, since the character she plays goes through every age from teen to ancient.  Edmund Gwenn (Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street) gives a touching performance as the headmaster.  And a host of support players add invaluable touches as various students and friends whom Miss Bishop comes into contact with.

A word about versions.  The so-called Remastered version isn't.  Not only that, but its sound and picture quality are poor and much worse than my videotape version on VHS from AlphaVideo.  I haven't seen the other DVD version, so can't comment on it.  My advice is to buy the VHS, the one with the cover image.",1162598400,14,933,5.0064935064935066
1196830,5,B000007PQ8,"Martha Scott never reached stardom as a Bette Davis or Joan Crawford but she was one of our best actresses nevertheless. I love this movie. It also reminded me of another movie not out on DVD ""Good Morning, Miss Dove"" with Jennifer Jones. Both films salute teachers that inspire their students to be better than themselves.",1161475200,5,323,4.785714285714286
1196831,5,B000007PQ8,"This is one of the best classic chick flicks I've sen in a while. It's heavy on the romance but the main thrust is that a woman can overcome any obstacle in her path if she just stays true to herself. Of course the mainstay of the film is her competing with another woman for the man she loves, but that's incidental to the overall theme of female courage. It's a strong showing from the 1940s and very well preserved.",1153699200,4,418,4.2375
1196832,5,B000007PQ8,"This is the type of 1940s romance film that they don't make anymore. The basic story has been told a billion times but always seems to work. A woman falls in love with a man, but there is competition and the girl has to find a way to keep him while maintaining her pride. I'm not sure why they don't use this basic plot anymore in Holywood, because it always makes for an interesting story. Martha Scott used to be a screen legend, but has been forgotten about lately and this is a good film to remind yourself why she was so famous at the time.",1148256000,3,545,4.150943396226415

1196834,5,B000007PQ8,"""Cheers for Miss Bishop is one classic that no aspiring actress or fan of Martha Scott should miss. It portrays vividly what a person can achieve through sheer determination. Probably what made the movie such a memorable one is the fact that the character she plays resembles her own life of struggle and victory over circumstance that few would face with such grit and courage. I personally would recommend this fabulous Hollywood classic to all young ladies who seem to be groping for a meaning in life.""",1146528000,5,506,4.827586206896552

7905120,5,B000007PQ8,"What a fabulous film. Wish I could see it in color to see the fashions of those times! About 60 years of fashion sped by? Refreshing to see a time when education was the goal and not an endless party as I think entertainment reflects the times. I loved how the older lady guided her young niece to make a life changing decision without lecturing or haranguing. I had a friend like that when I was young, art imitates life. Of course, it was a lot of life squished into ninety minutes but the writer and director did a great job. I didn't feel rushed through most of it.

Leaves a pretty sad taste in your mouth, but otherwise fun to watch and learn how far we've come.  Extra bonus - Sidney Blackmer in a small role.
