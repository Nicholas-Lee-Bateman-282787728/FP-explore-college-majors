3417778,5,B0018O50VG,"The Orange Thief is a must-see movie for anyone who loves thoughtful foreign-language films, great music, a simple tale told masterfully and/or Sicily.  I too saw this at the Milwaukee Film Festival and fell in love with it.  In fact, I had some of the soundtrack in my head (in a good way) for a good while.  I bought it the day it came out and have already watched it twice!",1219708800,25,376,4.267605633802817
3417779,5,B0018O50VG,"Saw this at the 2006 Milwaukee Film Festival where it received a standing ovation. The audience LOVED it, and so did I. Charming, funny, at times philosophical and ultimately emotionally moving, with some great music to boot. Why no film distributors snapped this one up really baffles me. I couldn't wait to see it again and I'm happy it's now available on DVD.",1213488000,25,362,4.761904761904762

3417781,5,B0018O50VG,This is a fabulous movie about things that matter in life.  Too bad the creators of the film were robbed by the industry machine and didn't make a cent.  The acting and photography and editing creates a miracle of a movie.  I watch this at least once a year --when I forget the meaning of life.  You will too.,1429747200,2,309,4.186440677966102

3417786,5,B0018O50VG,Well if you came here to watch an italian movie you're out of luck. This movie is almost exclusively in the sicilian LANGUAGE. This movie is full of great pizzica music and traditional songs like Ciuri ciuri which translates to fiori fiori in italian. This movie is suprisingly sicilian... Its a young guy who is poor and love to live wild and dreams of nothing else but to have a peice of land.. he can't imagine working under a boss. He comes to love to sing in our sicilian traditions. I really cant say enough good things about this movie! The characters are very raw and they remind me of my family and friends... and the main character really reminds me of myself haha. Si voi nu pezzu ri terra e ti piaci cantari nostri cazuni e' nu beddu film. W 'u latruni d'aranci e 'a bedda Sicilia nostra!!,1395705600,5,801,4.382550335570469
3417787,5,B0018O50VG,"I've never seen anything like this before!  This is a movie that I am able to watch more than once.  I do not tend to like ""musicals"", and this is not strictly a musical, but the songs are lovely.  They are almost a character in and of themselves.",1391904000,,247,4.104166666666667
3417788,1,B0018O50VG,I definitely would not recommend purchasing this DVD. The theme of the film could have been made with less profanity and violence.,1374364800,,130,4.954545454545454
3417789,5,B0018O50VG,"I'm astonished this movie did not receive more attention.  The story line is darling and the music nothing short of superb,",1367107200,,123,4.857142857142857
3417790,4,B0018O50VG,"I really enjoy foreign movies, especially Asian flicks and every once and a while I'll try something different. I was attracted by the cover of the DVD, nice color and font, so I decided to try it out. From the moment it started I was sucked in, the thief was great. A guy just looking for a chunk of land he can call his own. The songs are great, especially ""The little donkey,"" which I had to make a copy for myself in my notebook. You'll definitely want to take a trip to Sicily after watching, the film really captures the beauty of the country side. Perfect date film. Enjoy.

3417791,5,B0018O50VG,Just loved this movie. It just reminded me of my trips to Sicilia . Makes me want to go back. The colors and the people are wonderful,1359936000,,133,3.962962962962963
3417792,5,B0018O50VG,Great story.  Very Off Beat and creative. I  thoroughly enjoyed watching this magnificent movie.  I recommend it highly to everyone.  It was also very funny and different.,1359244800,,171,5.222222222222222
3417793,5,B0018O50VG,This is a wonderful movie anyone should watch.  First off THIS IS NOT IN ENGLISH!  Subtitles are a must!  If that doesn't put you off then I cannot recommend this movie enough.  Its a light-hearted movie with delightful music.,1353888000,,226,4.717948717948718
3417794,5,B0018O50VG,"A great script does not require poetry, it requires solid characters and great plot development. If you did not find the poetry in this film, then you must not be able to read subtitles quickly. I thought this movie was so good that I watched it more than 2x. I loved the writers sense of humor. I'm searching for the soundtrack or more information about the songs in the movie. I'll probably buy the movie. BRAVO! Best 13K ever spent!",1346025600,,435,4.45
3417795,2,B0018O50VG,"Im a big fan of foreign films specially Italian films ..but this one is ranked among the very worse I have ever seen .....this film fail to deliver but one message the discontent of the Sicilian population with the current goverment,the lack of oportunities and so on....but half of the film is base on this caracter's ability to get this woman to sing in order to get some land promised by  a murderer named ""Filo Fino"" I could not bare it is that bad. It doesn't develop this film was probably done with a very limited capital and an abundant lack of talent ,it went on and on.....I waited for a turn somewhere in the almost 2 hours but other than he got the girl to sing and sing ,that was about it. Dont buy it. Look at others. Buona Fortuna,MG.",1330473600,,749,4.3120567375886525
3417796,4,B0018O50VG,"In the age of fancy, big budget Hollywood movies it is easy to forget about the beauty of simplicity. Part of what makes this movie so amazing is the circumstances surrounding its production. For example, it cost only around $15k to make, had a crew of non-professional actors, and was shot in a month. Moreover the 3 directors independently filmed a part of the movie, which they then stitched together after determining which scenes to use in the final cut. And they used a SONY HDV video camera to film the entire movie.

The other part of why this movie is good is that it revolves around a simple but compelling plot line. An orphan who becomes an orange thief has a dream to own some land of his own. But the story is not dramatic as one might think; in fact, it's largely comical. There is a raw savage quality to the movie that makes it sweet, beautiful, and satisfying.",1326672000,10,878,4.453416149068323
3417797,2,B0018O50VG,"First of all, some might call this a comedy, or neither a romantic comedy.  It is certainly not funny and not slapstick!  The Orange Thief is Italian story of a thug whose life has been all about stealing oranges from the groves of Italy.  His life has been beatings for stealing fruit, but that's all he does, steal.

Landing in jail, he meets Turrido, a murder, who makes a deal with him to record the music of his girlfriend, Rosalba.  This is his big dream, to have her music recorded.  Therefore, he employs the aid of his jailmate who will soon be released.  Turrido also promises the orange thief a piece of the land the thief has always dreamed of.

It was a challenge to get Rosalba to sing.  He starts playing incorrectly to trick her to sing as she notices he is doing it wrong, and he gets help trying to get her to sing.  He records her, and the jailed guy listened to her, and he was inspired to become a musician.

This group of people living through each others dreams, one helps the other.

What you will see is some beautiful landscapes of the countryside. There is plenty of guitar music here, but it is not memorable.  The film has won some lesser known awards

Additionally, all these 5 star ratings, but no one can tell you what the movie is about!!  Makes me wonder if anybody actually saw this boring film.  ....Rizzo",1290816000,2,1341,4.390243902439025
3417798,5,B0018O50VG,"This film was a delight!  I don't know the story behind the film or the actors but there is a ""homemade"" feel to the film that enhances the story.  I just sent Bread and Tulips to my Italian born and raised mother and this DVD is going into the mailbox next.
P.S. Never try to learn Italian from Orange Thieves! They are not to be trusted.  Even my very own cousins, (who, to the best of my knowledge, paid for all of their citrus)taught me to say horrible things.  It was ok though, I actually did use some of it later in life.
Perhaps someone was looking for ""Rosetta"", not Rosalba?",1279497600,2,584,4.2342342342342345
3417799,1,B0018O50VG,"I can't believe this got so many good reviews.  To each his own I guess.  Neither my husband nor I liked this movie.  I didn't even watch the end as I couldn't stand to waste any more time.  The 'thief' is constantly getting beaten up and seeing his bloody face again and again was too much.  The character seems to have no common sense.  Poetic?  Are you kidding?  A bunch of 'thieves' sitting around a fire saying f--- the government, f--- Italy, etc. etc.  I've seen quite a few Italian movies and this one is at the bottom of my list.  Best Italian movie I've seen recently was ""Ex"" at an Italian Film Festival - Superb.  This one doesn't come close.",1276041600,6,654,4.322314049586777
3417800,5,B0018O50VG,"Not since Cinema Pardiso have I loved Italian Cinema SO much.  Growing up watching movies like Divorce and Marriage Italian Style, you cannot help but fall in love with Italian filmes.  Ironically, this is an Italian Film written by Americans and their love of Italian Cinema is present in every shot and line.  I came across this film by ""accident"" while searching Amazon for new Italian films that I might have missed like The Wedding Director.  And, with the latest Giuseppe Tornatore Baaria a HUGE disappointment, perhaps Giuseppe Tornatore should take note of The Orange Thief.  This film has love, heart, song, and romance in ways that we picture Italian cinema to be.  This film a such a treasure and I am deeply sorry that I never got a chance to experience it in a theater.  Do yourself a favor... fall in love with this movie.... it is a film that you won't soon forget.",1270944000,6,880,4.638709677419355
3417801,5,B0018O50VG,"A delightfully crazy & wacky story in the genre of Roberto Benigni! Off the wall. For those unfamiliar with Roberto Benigni's humor (Jonny Stecchino,Down by Law, Life is Beautiful etc.) think of wacky or films of Woody Allen.  Wonderful scenes of the beautiful countryside of western Sicily. it's a trip you won't want to miss!",1267315200,2,327,4.945454545454545
3417802,2,B0018O50VG,"Aside from the tolerable folk music and occasional pretty scenery, I see nothing to praise.  This is not allegory, not poetry, not even good fantasy.  A bunch of amateurs pretending to be film-makers.  They don't even seem to recognize the difference between an orange and an olive tree.  Save your money.  This is a waste and a big mess.  The film-akers are the real thieves.",1262044800,3,376,4.707692307692308
3417803,5,B0018O50VG,"I love the Orange Thief! It takes a bit to get into, but is well worth it.  It's as beautiful, funny, sad and human as Sicily itself. And could it be that with all its fruit, almonds, olives and ""batches"" (beaches), Sicily is still so poor because, like Rosalba, it shoots itself in the hand? If you have Southern Italian or Sicilian roots, you may see your relatives in some of these characters, or, as I did, in myself.

If you came to this movie for the Italian language, you may be disappointed. There is much Sicilian dialect, so the only recognizable Italian you hear may be that spoken by the prison guard and the tourist - disgraziati!

What ties all together is the music - great Sicilian folk music. I hope this group produces more music, and many, many more movies!",1258934400,28,776,4.450704225352113
3417804,1,B0018O50VG,We bought this Italian movie to help us learn the lanuage. It was nothing less than idiotic.  We found it a waste of time and money.,1258588800,5,132,4.076923076923077
3417805,5,B0018O50VG,"Guerrilla film making at its best.
With a rough story outline and a free-wheeling production approach where everyone was a director, Artie Walinksi, Vinnie Angel, Boogie Dean created an engaging glimpse at life in central Sicily.
The characters are developed and you actually care about them as they all look for and eventually find redemption from their own personal travails.
Watch for Micaela Helvetica Saxer to be the next breakout star.
The camera loves her.",1251676800,6,463,5.1866666666666665

This film is one of my favorites all time, great acting, beautiful story, and great jail scenes. What more could you ask for?

8270178,2,B0018O50VG,"I am a follower of Italian cinema and in particular, material from Sicily. I had good expectations of this movie, but they were not met. It's low budget, yes but that should not necessarily matter, if the writing, acting and cinematography are creative. Unfortunately, it seems like this movie was done by friends in a theater arts class at school. Disappointing.",1490572800,,363,4.967213114754099

8270181,5,B0018O50VG,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It really helps if you have some understanding of the Sicilian culture to appreciate the Sicilian humor and illusions.  Few people know that this film won many awards (in Europe, of course), and was produced in about 3 months using Sony video cameras and no professional actors.  I think there were only 13 actors, non professional, and the total cost of the film was around $10,000.",1464912000,,428,4.68
