4332517,5,B004DIPKZK,"Okay .. I read the reviews here .. They're dead on .. These reviewers describe the performance better than I ever could.  I'm here to talk about the audio - the DTS HD Master audio.

Over the many, many decades I've fought and scratched my way through audio format after format and system component after component doing everything I knew how to bring, accurately, the sound of the concert hall into my living room.  Finally, after all those years of trying, failing, and trying again, along came the SACD.  I've got to tell you, to hear MTT's San Francisco Symphony performances of the complete Mahler series, all in musically accurate SACD multichannel has been for me, finally, audio nirvana.

But I love watching the performances. I have the complete Abbado Lucerne festival Mahler DVD series.  And I can see that Abbado pulls the absolute best out of every one of his musicians .. But seeing isn't enough.  It's been frustrating being able to experience either SACD's great audio .. or .. DVD's video with not-so-great audio.  I've been hoping and praying that the day would come, before my time has come, that technology advances would allow the best of both worlds to merge as one.

And now it has come to pass - fine audio - fine video - fine performance - all in one.  But .. Comparing the Tilson Thomas Mahler 9 SACD with this Abado Mahler 9 Blu-ray disc, both playing simultaneously, switching back and forth from one preamp input to the other, from an audio perspective the nod still has to go with MTT's SACD, but of course the SACD engineers had to concentrate on only audio.  But it was not easy to say the SACD sounded better.  They were very close in sound quality.  I'm truly impressed.  Now we can have it all.  Thank you Accentus.",1304380800,16,1750,4.6
4332518,5,B004DIPKZK,"This is the best performance of the ninth that I ever watched. Extremely ballanced with nothing missing. The sound is very homogenous yet very clear and detailed. The picture is also first rate. Sorry, nothing to complain about. Five stars all the way.",1299974400,4,252,4.883720930232558
4332519,5,B004DIPKZK,"Since the beginning of Claudio Abbado's recording relationship with Mahler back in the early 1970's, it has been abundantly clear that here was a conductor with an extraordinary flair for the style of this at the same time childishly extrovert and emotionally twisted composer, a conductor who understood to perfection how to translate a very peculiar and extensive use of the symphony orchestra into very effective music. In those days I did, I must admit, miss a bit of the neurotic part of Mahler, his schismatic relations to stif (and often hypocritical) Judeo-Christian morality, his at times spasmotically depressive ""Weltanschauung"", and his life-long fear of loss and death. For proper illumination of these facets of the music one had to turn to Leonard Bernstein, the other great Mahlerian of the era, who admittedly, for better and for worse, laid it on a bit thick at times.

I feel bad saying this, but - to me at least - it seems that Abbado's much publicized protracted near-death experience (or maybe it is just age?) has turned his focus elsewhere in Mahler's symphonic output. Since the beginning of the present set of symphonies (recorded on DVD, and now Blu-ray, at the summer festivals in idyllic Lucerne), of which the 8th is now the only one left to be tackled, we have been given an otherworldly beauty combined with dark introspection and the most oppressive - but never caricated - angst, as well as artistically perfect musicianship, and the picture is now complete. On the back of the cover of the 3rd symphony the New York Times is quoted, calling Abbado ""the most respected living conductor"", which, certainly when it comes to Mahler, is an all but inescapable conclusion. I can think of no one who in that field could even scratch his knee caps.

Much has been said and written over the years about soloists and their ability to work constructively with other musicians. I think it was Menahem Pressler, undaunted octogenarian pianist of the Beaux Arts Trio for going on 56 years, who once said that he gave up a career as a soloist because not just the touring activity but also the mindset would damage his work with the trio. He may have been absolutely right at the time, but today it seems soloists are made of a different clay, and I can only say that the handpicked Lucerne Festival Orchestra is an unmitigated joy to both watch and listen to. Like a shoal of sardines the members twist and turn in perfect unison in their sometimes superhuman attempts to give the last drop of their essences for a maestro, who has, in this troupe of extraordinary artists, found a Pretorian guard who will literally lay down their lives to turn every minute shade of his unique insight into reality. I'm not saying that the Berlin Philharmonic didn't try to do the same - or the Vienna ditto, for that matter - but the devotion and the will to sacrifice oneself utterly for the good of the larger purpose, as experienced in these recordings, is little short of incredible.

How fare the music then? Well, I hate to say: ""I lack the words needed for an adequate description"" - for what then is the point of a review, but ... I'm afraid that for once I find that I really do. Compared to his recording of the 9th with the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester back in 2004 (as well as his otherwise marvelous BPO CD-recording of 2002), Abbado is just that much more THERE. In almost every phrase I find things in the music I never heard before, and the suspense and intensity is, for want of a better word, Hitchcock'ian (or is it 'esque?). Gaunt and occasionally teary eyed, Abbado presides over the solemn rites of the tortured soul of Gustav Mahler, and at the end of the unprecedented close to two minutes of dead silence following the last notes of the valedictory Adagio, I sincerely thought: ""OK, now the violins get up and carry the maestro - drooling and cyanotic - off stage like they did Sinopoli; anything less would be an anticlimax"". Not quite yet, though. May whosoever guards the last existing iota of Mahler's genius grant Abbado another decade or two of service to the cause. No better man could conceivably be found!

Every issue in this series of Mahler symphony recordings is a revelation - the 2nd, 6th and 7th in particular. This 9th is an unmissable non-plus-ultra of inspired music-making. Get it now - or, trust me, you'll be the poorer for it.",1298937600,15,4383,4.703125
4332520,5,B004DIPKZK,"This is, strictly speaking, not a review of this stunning performance, but simply an opportunity to add five more stars to the other great reviews. I have seen all of the Lucerne Festival performances under Abbado, and they are all outstanding. But this performance of the 9th is, arguably, the best performance you will ever hear or see.  All of the Abbado performances of Mahler are among the very best in my opinion, but if you get to buy only one, this should be your choice. It deserves ten stars. I think the orchestra and audience would agree. Now, is there any chance we will ever get to hear a performance of Das Lied Von Der Erde from the Master? Let us hope so.",1297123200,11,672,4.419354838709677
4332521,5,B004DIPKZK,"The universe of fans utterly devoted to Abbado's continuing cycle of Mahler with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra needs no recommendation for this performance of the Ninth.  The very astute Andrea Solari predicted, back in September (see his comments to my review of the Mahler 1 release), that the Ninth would appear early in 2011.  I must admit, when he said that, I was skeptical.  But, he was right, and here it is (although I'm puzzled why Amazon right now has a 2-4 week delay in shipping it).  I'm very happy that I didn't have to wait until this fall to get it.  Mr. Solari was also accurate in his comments, where he expressed his belief that the DVD's producers would include the minutes-long silence at the end of the performance, which Mr. Solari witnessed in person.  As Mr. Morrison reports, there is a full 2 1/2 minutes of absolute silence at the end of this performance, and I am incredibly grateful this was not left on the cutting room floor.  We get shots of audience members, many of whom appear moved in ways that defy description; a shot of the principal violist, Wolfram Christ, frozen after performing those extraordinary final four notes of the symphony; and shots of Abbado, as he ever so slowly lowers his left and right arms, and as he struggles to hold back his own tears.  He and the members of the orchestra begin to move, only gradually, after these 2 1/2 minutes, which seems to free the audience to begin their applause, which, appropriately, is thunderous.  Again, as in the Mahler 1 release, we are treated to views of the orchestra members hugging, shaking hands, and congratulating each other, as they begin to leave the stage; and, to a view of Abbado, just a few steps in stage right, with a solo bow and wave to those in the audience still applauding and cheering (this must have been going on for 20 minutes or more).

Perhaps I'm dwelling too much on what we see (and hear) after the music is over.  But it's important to me, especially in these Abbado/Lucerne Mahler performances, which I have been unable to attend in person, and which I wish more than anything in my life I had been able to attend.  I want to share just a fraction of what it might have felt like to be there.  I feel as though I have been on this Mahler journey with Abbado and the orchestra, and the experience is heightened by what I can share at the end, with the audience members who were so extraordinarily fortunate to attend these concerts.  I have probably 15 different recordings, on LP and CD, of Mahler 9.  If I just want the music, I can turn to them.  But if I want an experience to help me imagine what it might have felt like to be there in the audience, I can turn to this DVD.  This is a gift I cherish.

But, considering simply the performance and the interpretation, this one is, in my view, sublime.  The Rondo-Burleske is more manic than I've ever heard before, and in the movement's closing pages, I kept thinking, there's no way they can play faster; well, when they hit the Presto, they were a runaway train--yet, in complete control.  The final measure's three eighth-notes rang through the hall in a way I've not heard yet in these Lucerne releases.  The look on Abbado's face at that moment is priceless.  I wonder if even he has just a slight bit of astonishment at how amazingly this movement's blazing finish came off.  And I loved that there was not much of a pause before heading into the Adagio, which indeed, as some have pointed out, is very, very slow.  My preference is for a very slow Adagio, so I was happy with Abbado's tempos in this performance.  If on another night he had a slightly faster tempo, I'm glad the producers went with this one for their release.

It was nice to see Kolja Blacher and Sabine Meyer return to the orchestra (I wish Albrecht Mayer had also been able to return), and I missed the usual principal horn player (whose name I'm too lazy to look up right now), although the player here was outstanding.  (And many who have been there from the beginning--e.g., Jacques Zoon, Reinhold Friedrich, Natalia Gutman, Wolfram Christ--are happily here).  In addition, there is a bonus feature of a conductor-only camera view of the first movement.

This is yet another--no surprise here--Abbado/Lucerne Mahler release that must be added to the collection of anyone devoted to their performances over the past 8 years.  My deepest thanks to the relatively young Accentus Music and their gifted management and artistic team for bringing this DVD to us so quickly!",1296950400,40,4528,4.595771144278607
4332522,5,B004DIPKZK,"First, let me say that this is a performance ""to die for"". Abbado clearly sees the final adagio as a transition to the hereafter and his treatment of the final pages is as much a spiritual as it is a musical experience. This really needs to be seen, not just heard, to be believed.

It is a relief to report that both the picture and sound quality are superb. On my system, at least, I would say this the best sound so far in the Abbado cycle. This disc is of course produced and mastered by Accentus, not Euroarts, though the production crew is the same as for the previous Abbado recordings from Lucerne.

So, no problems. A MUST for all music lovers - not just Mahler fans.",1296777600,32,676,4.2734375
4332523,5,B004DIPKZK,"This is a special dvd. (I just want to know how Scott Morrison got his copy so early!)The playing is immaculate and the control by Abbado is amazing. Sound is perfect, likewise the video.

HOWEVER. I think I still prefer the earlier Abbado GMJO (Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra) version. I watched it again after twice reviewing this new one. As artistically perfect as the Lucerne group is, the GMJO seem to have more passion, and their collective sonority (especially the strings) is edgier and fuller. Perhaps acoustics played a part. But this group has played this piece many times with other conductors. I think it's more in their blood. Many from the GMJO now play for the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, so there's obviously some carry-over.

I am one who doesn't believe a glorious adagio has to be played at a glacial tempo for it to be moving. The Lucerne adagio is 2 1/2 mins longer than the GMJO - 28.11 vs. 25.41, and to my ears less affecting. For example, listen to the phrase starting at 114.40 on the Lucerne compared with the same one at 108.30 on the GMJO - the latter has more angst. Incidentally, if one goes back to the earliest Mahler 9 recorded by Bruno Walter and the VPO in 1938, Walter whips through the adagio in 18.20 - that's ten minutes faster than the latest Abbado, and with huge tempo variations! The other movements' tempi are similar to these two newer versions. And this old Walter reading, my friends, is more white hot and intense than any I have heard since.

Remember, Walter knew Mahler well, and must have been aware of his tempi preferences. Mahler always worried that future conductors would play his works too slowly, for emotional effect. You run into this a lot also with the Adagietto from #5 and the last movement of #3. For my taste, the GMJO strikes a good middle ground in this #9 Adagio. Incidentally, I did hear from someone who attended the two Lucerne performances that were used to film this release, that the Saturday version was quite a bit faster than the Friday one, which is the one I watched live on the webcast. I wonder which adagio they used for the dvd?

I really liked the first three movements on this latest release - the playing is truly astonishing in its finesse. But if you love Mahler's music as I do (almost 50 years of being spellbound by it) check out both the Abbado/GMJO dvd and the Walter cd (available on Dutton or EMI) for the Adagio - as well as this new one.

Let's hope Abbado's health allows a #8 this year (which I hear is scheduled) and perhaps even a completed #10!",1296518400,11,2550,4.534782608695652
4332524,5,B004DIPKZK,"This performance is unbelievable. The orchestra plays with total committment throughout, and with the greatest virtuosity I can imagine. You will never see more unity of purpose in a performance, nor a greater involvement of every single person on stage. It sounds like the best possible string quartet, but 110 people play.
At the end, the audience moved, and in awe, wait more than TWO minutes to begin applauding. It is a standing ovation, once they have recovered enough to clap.
I have never said anything like this about an orchestral concert. Please see this if you live your life loving music.",1296432000,14,601,4.901960784313726
4332525,5,B004DIPKZK,"Claudio Abbado formed the Lucerne Festival Orchestra in 2003; it is made up of principal orchestral players from all over Europe coupled with a core group of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, themselves mostly alumni of Abbado's Mahler Youth Orchestra, a marvelous ensemble in their own right. Performing as principals are such musicians as violinist Kolja Blacher, violist Wolfram Christ from the Berliner Philharmoniker, cellist Natalia Gutman, and Wiener Philharmoniker double bassist Alois Posch. All four members of the Leipzig String Quartet as well as harpist Marie-Pierre Langlamet are likewise part of the ensemble; wind players include flutist Jacques Zoon, clarinetist Sabine Meyer and her woodwind ensemble, horn player Bruno Schneider, and trumpeter Reinhold Friedrich. So, even though they are, so to speak, a pick-up orchestra, they have been together through eight Festivals and play like a long-standing ensemble of the highest accomplishment. This DVD is one of the several they have made with Maestro Abbado of the symphonies of Gustav Mahler, some of which I've reviewed here: e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-7-Claudio-Abbado-Lucerne-Festival-Orchestra/dp/B000F6YWM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler - Symphony No. 7 / Claudio Abbado, Lucerne Festival Orchestra</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5-Claudio-Abbado-Lucerne-Festival-Orchestra/dp/B00081TXTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler - Symphony No. 5 / Claudio Abbado, Lucerne Festival Orchestra</a>, etc. I've been very impressed with all of them. This performance from the summer of 2010 of Mahler's last-completed numbered symphony, the Ninth, tops the list. This is a simply sensational performance. I had earlier reviewed a DVD of Abbado conducting the Mahler Jugendorchester in the Ninth,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-9-Claudio-Abbado-Gustav-Mahler-Jugendorchester-Accademia-Di-Santa-Cecilia-Rome/dp/B0009JVOIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler - Symphony No. 9 / Claudio Abbado, Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, Accademia Di Santa Cecilia, Rome</a>&nbsp;and raved about it; this one tops that one. In fact, it is, for me, the Ninth of a lifetime.

The Ninth is one of those works which comes to have a special place in the hearts of all who love it. For me, it is the symphony most likely to make me break down in tears at its conclusion. I did that with the earlier DVD and I certainly did it with this performance. The symphony ends as softly as it is possible to play (and to hear) and Abbado doesn't lower his right hand at the end of the symphony for a good two minutes. The audience maintains  a rapt silence until Abbado finally lowers his hand and then they burst into a tumultuous ovation that goes on and on. Fittingly, I must say. One sees, in the audience, tears streaming down several faces. For me (and for many others), this symphony, written not long before Mahler's own death, is his farewell to life and I will admit that because of my advanced age and sometimes fragile health it reminds me in the most beatific fashion of my own mortality. Those final moments convey a peaceful acceptance of the inevitable, for Mahler and for me and, I daresay, for others. I suppose that knowing about Abbado's own health problems adds to the emotion of the performance. The symphony's first and fourth movements are among the greatest slow movements ever written. And they are played as movingly as I've ever heard them.

To sum up, this is a great performance of a great symphony. It is filmed with taste (and includes an option to focus entirely on the conductor, although I prefer the usual visual highlighting of the players as well as the conductor) and the sound recording is excellent. I viewed this DVD in regular format, not Blu-Ray, and was mightily impressed; one can only imagine how the Blu-Ray will look and sound.

I have rarely seen such commitment -- devotion -- of conductor and orchestra musicians to ""realizing"" the score (as Eduard van Beinum used to say). Mahler is reputed to have said something like ""The most important part of the music is not in the notes.""  Abbado and his Lucerne Festival Orchestra forces realized and articulated that part through the music.  Every imaginable human emotion is there. In the final movement, the tenderness, sadness, and at the end perhaps transfiguration are beyond words.  If there is such a place as Eternity beyond the palpable world, Abbado  and his Lucerne Festival Orchestra forces took us there.

4332531,5,B004DIPKZK,"About the quality of the disc: when the disc was prepared, they used the best available format at the time. The format is 80 50. To be able to listen and view this disc I had to update my music system.

There has been a lively discussion as to whether or not this symphony portends Mahler's death or not with some reviewers citing Henry-Louis de la Grange as denying this. de la Grange states, after explaining that the majority of people - among them composers as well as conductors- he states that ""this author has chosen to challenge the established wisdom."" No matter how much I admire de la Grange, I have ""chosen"" (to use his choice of words) to believe what most people believe. My reasons are - I think - better than his poor explanations: my entire musical soul tell me that Symphony 9 is indeed a retrospective view of Mahler's life, ending with his own death.

Further, in a Wagnerian twist, Claudio Abbado ""chose"" to dim the lights exactly at a time when I can ""see"" a group of angels ( the same from the Third?) descending on a dying Mahler to take his soul, when departed, to the God that was waiting for him (obviously the same as in the Third).

Once again this disc places the listener in the middle of the orchestra and in front of Maestro Abbado, where one can see that not only Abbado was several times about to cry but several of the musicians were in a similar state. One can only admire the love the musicians feel for Abbado, reflected in their faces and also in the fact that on many occasions they want him to receive the ovations from the public rather than sharing the moment with a standing orchestra.

I am sure that at this moment and for a long time, Mahler is in deep and light conversations with Maestro Claudio Abbado (R.I.P).

This disc, alongside the set containing Symphonies 1 to 7 by the Lucerne Festival Orchestra is a must for all Mahler's lovers, as this reviewer is.",1392076800,9,1910,4.43019943019943

And to see the beautiful expression on his face in those final bars of the Fourth Movement is unforgettable.

One of the best Mahler 9 is Abbado`s version with Berlin Ph. Thus, Abbado does know how task should be done.
 Mahlers only chamber work is a childish unfinished Piano Quartet.  His symphonies have some delicatesses somewhere, however their general feelings are mostly the human anxiety itself.
  Lucerne Orchestra is a respectable group, but Mahler 9th is not a work acquainted with details over the ""group tissue"".  We could never choose Bruckner or Mahler for a string quartet or octet.
  Abbado's Bruckner 7th with Lucerne is perfect as if he did understand it. With Bruckner he avoided chamber approach.
  This Mahler 9th is good in central movements, less noisy than usually, but the heavy finale lacks pathos, tragedy, emotion, rubbato,and weight.
 One could say it is a new ""view""or ""landscape"" of Mahler,  as we had with Handels Messiah under few ""original"" instruments and voices.
Would my sense of Mahlerian feelings be wrong? Was Mahler light and transparent? I don t believe so.

PORTUGUES: Sou mrbido mahleriano de nascena,ou mesmo de antes. Conheo bastante sobre seus intrpretes. A Nona  a mais triste de suas sinfonias e o adgio final, certamente o mais profundo dos grandes adgios,junto com o da oitava de Bruckner. Uma das melhores verses da Nona  de Abbado com a Filarmnica de Berlin. Assim, Abbado sabe como cumprir a tarefa. As sinfonias de Mahler tem certas delicadezas, porm seu principal sentimento  geralmente a ansiedade humana em si prpria. A Orquestra de Lucerna  um grupo respeitvel, entretanto a Nona de Mahler nunca ser uma obra relacionada com detalhes ""acima"" do tecido orgnico. Nunca poderamos escolher Bruckner ou Mahler para uma reduo a quarteto de cordas. A Stima de Bruckner com ""Lucerna"" est perfeita,como se isto Abbado tivesse entendido. Com Bruckner ele evitou a leitura camerstica.
Esta Nona de Mahler est boa nos movimentos centrais, menos ruidosos que usualmente, mas o pesado final carece de ""patos"", tragdia, emoo, ""rubato"" e gravidade.
Algum poderia dizer que isso  uma nova viso ou ""paisagem"" de mahler, assim como nos tivemos com o Messias de Handel sob poucas vozes e instrumentos""originais"".
  Estaria errado meu senso dos sentimentos mahlerianos? Foi Mahler leve e transparente? Nao creio.

4332537,5,B004DIPKZK,"Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This performance from 2004 is clearly one of great authority and is given with equal authority by Abbado's own creation, the aptly named Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra. This orchestra takes in players of up to 26 years of age drawn from players from the whole of Europe and is the result of annual extensive interviews held by prominent orchestral players in 25 European cities.

The orchestra is widely respected for its technical and musical qualities and has similarities in concept to the Lucerne Festival Orchestra which also recorded the work a little while later. There are, however, significant differences between these two performances and recordings that become apparent right from the start and which are generally maintained throughout.

This slightly earlier performance is markedly more dramatic and forthright with less emphasis on particular soloists and with an inevitably stronger full orchestral presence. The pulse is more strongly forwardly pressing. This can be easily checked at any point but is very noticeable from the start of the 3rd movement, the rondo burlesque, where the burlesque element is more forceful. All of this is delivered with total assurance by the orchestra and absolutely no allowances have to be made for the players' relative youth or lack of long-term experience. It is arguable, of course, that these aspects of the players may have influenced Abbado's approach to the interpretation. Whatever the reason, there is a real choice to be made between the two interpretations.

The recording is very fine indeed and the Blu-ray version is a clear improvement. The camera work is fully involving for the viewer and provides crisp imaging with good colour rendition. The sound is very full and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. It offers a markedly more forward balance than that provided for the Lucerne version. This suits the different interpretation and is a very exciting alternative.

The differences between the performances are very significant in my view. There are two contradictory views on what this music is actually about and it seems to me that Abbado's performance here lays less stress on the death-obsessed views that is currently favoured (as described in the booklet interestingly). This is crucial to one's views of the symphony and to how one might react to these two differing performances.

The following is a fair resume of the opposing camps as regards the content or intentions behind this music:

There are two main competing views as to what this music is about. Mahler, at the time, had just completed two very successful seasons as conductor of The Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic and in his last letters said that he was looking forward to going on tour with the NYPO. In addition he had made considerable progress with his 10th Symphony. None of this suggests a man approaching imminent death and beset by such fears and possible anger as some would have it. On the contrary, it rather suggests a man at the top of his game and looking forward to his future life and continuing success. Indeed, this rather optimistic point of view is the one generally held and put forward by the eminent Mahler authority, Henri-Louis La Grange.

When we consider Mahler's own comments and those of his closest colleagues of the Second Viennese School we find that Mahler himself denied that there was any program to his symphonies and asked that they should be judged simply as pure music.

In addition, Berg described the 9th as `It expresses an extraordinary love of the earth, for Nature'.
Also Schoenberg had this to say ` [The Ninth] contains what may be termed objective, almost dispassionate statements of a beauty which will be perceived only by those who can dispense with visceral warmth and who feel comfortable in a climate of intellectual coldness'

Not a word is mentioned by these three men as regards a focus on death. So where does this leave us when confronted by conductors who insist that this is the work of a man facing imminent death with many strong and negative feelings?

When considering the music itself it is clear that the first movement has many retrospective elements. The second movement, a rustic lndler, becomes distorted and frantic as it progresses. The 3rd movement includes the term `burlesque' in the title which musically simply means a parody. None of these ideas are unique to this one work by Mahler and there are countless other examples in his work of these compositional features. The last movement certainly seems to fragment during its course and finishes very quietly indeed but what else could Mahler to do in order to create compositional balance? He could hardly have ended with yet another quick movement.

To return to Abbado, all one can say is that within his own apparently contrasting concepts of the work he and his two orchestras deliver all that one could imagine possible. I personally have a preference for this earlier performance with the Mahler Youth orchestra as I tend to favour the view that this is not death-obsessed music of a dying man but rather an expression of hope etc. as Berg, Schoenberg, Henri-Louis La Grange suggest and very much the music of a man looking forward to more life. We must remember that Mahler himself denied that there was any program to his symphonies and asked that they should be judged simply as pure music

In summary and in my opinion this is a clear contender for serious consideration for all the reasons as above and should give much pleasure and satisfaction to all purchasers who share either of Abbado's visions of the work. My personal preference, owning both, is for this earlier, less inward and more forwardly dramatic concept.

4332540,5,B004DIPKZK,"I have been waiting for this performance for a while. This score is one of the great documents we have I believe, up there with the 9th of Beethoven, the Matthew Passion and the Haydn Quartets of Mozart. It is a miraculous piece of music and I own every available recording. I have argued with colleagues and friends about the various versions, the relative strengths and weaknesses of Bernstein and Karajan, Barenboim and Boulez, Barbirolli and Gergiev and you name it (Horenstein, Walter etc etc etc.) What a wonderful world it is to have such a work and such great orchestras and conductors regularly playing and recording it. While it was nice to see the young, gifted and fresh faced Mahler Youth Orchestra playing it under Abbado in a DVD released a few years ago, I was disappointed with it. I found the playing good and Abbado's interpretation solid and well organized but something was missing. Compared with the heaven storming Mahler performances happening each summer in Lucerne, and recorded on video, it didn't even compare. After viewing the Lucerne Mahler 6 and Mahler 3 I thought to myself ""I hope to God they document an Abbado Mahler 9 again but with Lucerne! It deserves a performance by that incomparable Festival group conducted by Claudio, their knight with shining baton.""

Well........................here it is. All the reviews would declare it the performance of the ages, the essential, incandescent Mahler 9. The silence at the end for 2 minutes, those extraordinary players, Abbado's knowledge of the score. The beauty, the artistry, the dedication to the text, none of Bernstein's extremes, Rattle's intrusive penchant for detailing everything, Karajan's cold architecture or even Gergiev's wild flights of ""where is he going and where did that come from???"" Just Claudio Abbado performing a score he knows better than any other conductor alive and conducting literally the greatest symphonic players on the planet who would do anything he asks of them.

Is it what all these reviews say it is?? The performance to die for, the be all and end all performance of this piece???

Mmm....I would have to say it almost is. I believe it a performance worth 5 stars, the inner movements in particular wonderful as detail is everything with movement two and three. I disagree strongly with one of the other reviewers here who accuses Abbado of seeming not interested and not ""into it"". That is ridiculous. He has been battling health issues for years and has had to cancel many a performance each year for the past half decade. The man is 77 and had a life and death battle with stomach Cancer. Make no mistake. He is completely immersed in the score and his performance is completely dedicated in every way. There is no doubt that he is giving his all.

The reason I say almost is that while I was impressed with the sound, the playing, the conducting and the all around beauty of this disc and its presentation, far superior to the Youth Orchestra disc as expected, a voice in the back of my head led me to go to my collection and pull out an old document. What is the difference between this wonderful performance and an, iconic, legendary, timeless one. Is it execution?? No. This disc proves that it isn't because there is no better played Mahler 9 on the planet than this and there never will be again. This will be the greatest single performance of the Mahler 9 ever from a notes perspective guaranteed. Is it something else, the ineffable that can't be described???

I had stopped in recent years listening to the Bernstein/Mahler performances. I bought into the adage that they are distended and out of date; over the top and if Mahler were alive when Bernstein were giving those performances he would have had more than a word or two to say about tempo distortions and abusing his directions. It has been these Lucerne performances and some of the more faithful to the letter Abbado-style Mahler performances that have become my go-to discs choices in recent years. My admiration for Abbado, including his new Mozart and Beethoven recordings, knows no bounds.

ALL THAT SAID----today I went back and pulled out an old document. I watched Bernstein's old video of Mahler 9 with the Vienna Philharmonic taped at the Berlin Philharmonie in March of 1971. The video quality is not that good, the sound is middling and yet..........................I must say. That, to me, is the ultimate Mahler's Symphony No. 9!!!! I was just blown away by the intensity of the tempo choices, the rubato, the dynamics, the pacing and the emotion. Absolutely extraordinary on every level.

Yes---The Lucerne Festival Orchestra play this piece as if their life depends on it and the Vienna Phil look like they are shopping for toothpaste.
Yes---The video and audio quality of the new Abbado is as good as it is possible to get with our 21st century technology.
But---just listen to Bernstein's reading of the main ""ewig"" theme from Das Lied that begins the 1st movement and to the return of it twenty minutes later. Listen to the abandon of the third movement. Bernstein's performance is so deep, his understanding of the harmonic rhythm and the underlying musical logic is unrivaled.  We shall not see the like of him again ever. I had completely forgotten. As these moments rushed past I thought, ""this really was a hallowed time in performance history. Bernstein conducting Mahler."" Overblown? I guess so at times but life changing.

The Abbado is wonderful and well nigh perfect. It is so faithful textually. Mahler does NOT ask for a slowing, a rallentando when the ""ewig"" theme returns. He writes, ""Wie von Anfang"" ""Like the beginning"". So........Abbado does not slow down at all at the recapitulation. He is almost dry eyed. Bernstein does slow, not in a smarmy manner, but just so that it is all the more heartbreaking. Would Mahler object? I cannot imagine why he would. At that moment I can't imagine the piece played in a manner more attuned to the emotional reality of the music. I am assuming for Bernstein the ""beginning"" is a recollection that Mahler's music refers to, a beginning that is remembered but is not the same. After 20 minutes of music that fights itself from within Bernstein ushers this section in like no other. In Abbado's hands the moment is lovely and beautiful. In Bernstein's hands the moment is transcendent.

The bottom line is that both versions are magnificent and it could easily be argued that Abbado's is the one to buy if you have to choose one version (it is probably the most letter perfect while also being emotionally moving). For the Mahler 9 lover though I would say ""Buy the Abbado but don't expect it to be the final be all and end all.""

One must say that Abbado surpasses himself in the final movement and really achieves almost a Bernstein level of depth and intensity. It is incredibly moving. That movement assures this is a 5 star DVD. We shall not see the like of the Abbado Lucerne relationship again and it must be appreciated. Still; it must be said that Bernstein's Mahler 9 knows no equal in my mind and the Vienna Video is his finest I think. The Bernstein Live in Berlin/Mahler 9 is a bit messy and the Trombones miss the big climax in the 4th Adagio Movement though that version should be experienced for any Mahler 9 lover. The NY Phil reading is early and good but not close to the Lucerne Abbado in terms of clarity or knowledge of the score. The Concertgebouw Bernstein is a must but a bit distended and extreme. Again: The Vienna video????

Wow. Remarkable!!!

We are lucky to have both these documents quite frankly and I will return to them both and may amend this review again.

4332542,5,B004DIPKZK,"20 August 2010 was a night to be in Lucerne, Switzerland for the annual Lucerne Festival presentation of Claudio Abbado conducting his hand picked Lucerne Festival Orchestra in a definitive performance of the 9th Symphony of Gustav Mahler.  Fortunately for us the evening was captured not only in sound but in visual presence by this extraordinary DVD.  Though there are many fine recordings of the magnificent Mahler 9th symphony - including one by the younger Abbado conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1999 and conduction the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester in 2005 - but this 'experience' is likely not to be repeated, so perfect is it in every aspect.

Abbado, once the movie star handsome young Italian, has matured at age 77 to a rather gaunt but not frail presence.  What fears the audience my have as he appears before the opening of the symphony are immediately dispelled as he delves into the many intricacies and subtleties of this mammoth Mahler opus. Rarely has the architecture of the symphony made such sense: in the hands of other conductors there can be moments of distraction as Mahler begins to apparently stray from his overall concept. This not the case with Abbado as he seems to channel the composer.  Surely the finale Adagio has to be one of those rare instances in music when the world pauses as the movement quietly draws to completion.  The music says it, but the orchestra the maestro and the audience are stunned by the spell of silence that follows.  it is one of the most successful DVD moments of capturing an orchestral concert on film.

4332543,4,B004DIPKZK,"I did not like the video presentation at all. Although produced by many of the same names who did the Euro Arts 1-7 symphonies, this has been released by a different mob, Accentus, and with a very much darker and redder color balance. This makes camera focus more difficult and it shows with so much more of the frame now out of focus. The orchestra are dressed in suits this time and some very casual hippy kit and they just do not look as smart as in the well lit Euro Arts package. Playing and sound are very good but Blu-ray is about viewing as well and this release is greatly inferior in this respect. Pity they did not leave #9 to Euro Arts so we could have had a proper job done in a consistent way.",1310947200,2,707,4.1678832116788325
4332544,3,B004DIPKZK,"Bearing in mind that all reviews are subjective, I still couldn't wait to see and hear this performance of Mahler 9.  As I said in an earlier review, I've never heard a Mahler 9 that I didn't like.  The power, emotion and complexity of the music make pretty much any interpretation interesting, even if it's one you don't agree with.  This performance almost, but not quite, changes my view.
  The concert is visually beautiful.  Color and clarity are amazing,and the sound is very good.  The instrumentalists' faces show great commitment to their task.  But problems with this performance abound, in my opinion.
  I might as well start right up front.  Abbado looks to me as if he is not interested.  Other than an occsional hint of a smile (which I do appreciate.  Many people don't see that there is humor in the 2nd and 3rd movements) he doesn't seem to be giving anything to the music or the musicians, and that is what I feel when I listen to this performance - nothing.  I don't mind so much an interpretation that annoys me or angers me, such as Kurt Masur and the NYPO.  But this is the first Mahler 9 I've ever heard that bores me.  And the high-school histrionics of the 2 minute pause at the end doesn't fool me.  It is not a performance that catches my interest.  I'm not knocking Abbado as a conductor.  As I've said elsewhere, I don't believe in bad interpretations, and, furthermore, his Mahler 1 with the CSO is powerful enough to blow you out of your chair.  But I disagree completely with this performance.  I'm also not thrilled with the audio recording.  The beauty of Mahler is the complexity - the little things going on behind the big themes that add so much.  Too often in this recording, those little things are not audible.
  Okay, time for everyone to answer and tell me how wrong I am.  Like it or not, though, of all the performances of Mahler's Ninth that I have ever heard or own (15 to date) this is the one that I like the least.  NOT dislike, mind you.  Just like it the least.

UPDATE!  This is no longer my least favorite recording of Mahler's Ninth.  Since writing the original review, I've found numerous other recordings either commercially or sometimes through U-tube.  These include versions by Abravnel, Levine, Eschenbach, Walter (yes, I finally broke down and bought this classic recording with the VPO), Ludwig, Norrington, and Tabakov.  I have to say that I like all of them more than Abbado...EXCEPT Roger Norrington's.  I have the greatest respect for all conductors, and I've always  is said that there are no bad interpretations.  However, I can't for the life of me figure out what Norrington had in mind.  Abbado's reading may be, to me, uninspired, but it is at least beautiful.  Norrington's removal of vibrato actually works in a couple of places, adding an unearthly quality to certain passages, but for the most part, I just think it's ugly.  His pacing doesn't really bother me, but the sound is unpleasant...almost like an amateur orchestra tackling this music.  It really doesn't work for me.  I would, however, like to praise, especially, the Eschenbach and the Tabakov recordings.  Eschenbach (found this one on u-tube) is a very good performance, sonically and visually satisfying.  His is a slower paced Mahler 9, but not what you would call leisurely.  It is quite intense.  The most pleasant surprise for me is the Tabakov.  I had never heard of him, or the Sofia Philharmonic, yet this recording moved right up among my favorites.  The recording is good, not the very best, but good enough, and the interpretation is spellbinding.  I think it's a reading that should be heard.",1309478400,17,3644,4.7004754358161644
4332545,5,B004DIPKZK,"First, general comments about the series as a whole.  I concur with almost all previous reviews of Abbado's Mahler series.  I would like to add a few ""non-musical"" remarks.  The quality of the videos (especially in Blu-Ray) are fabulous.  By the way, the problems in some of the earlier copies from Euroarts have been corrected in the new Sym. 1-7 box.  But also, the thougtfullness of the cutting (and sometimes fading) to various musicians throughout the orchestra adds tremendously to your overall enjoyment.

Now, specifically about Sym. 9, I don't recall reading comments anywhere about the lights dimming.  Near the end of the final movement, the auditorium lights are dimmed just slightly.  Combine that with the orchestra playing very slowly and very softly (in itself an incredible display of focused musicianship). The result is a truly transcendent closing experience.  I recommend viewing this performance with close friends, in the evening.",1305331200,8,953,5.3

8425339,5,B004DIPKZK,"Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This performance from 2004 is clearly one of great authority and is given with equal authority by Abbado's own creation, the aptly named Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra. This orchestra takes in players of up to 26 years of age drawn from players from the whole of Europe and is the result of annual extensive interviews held by prominent orchestral players in 25 European cities.

The orchestra is widely respected for its technical and musical qualities and has similarities in concept to the Lucerne Festival Orchestra which also recorded the work a little while later. There are, however, significant differences between these two performances and recordings that become apparent right from the start and which are generally maintained throughout.

This slightly earlier performance is markedly more dramatic and forthright with less emphasis on particular soloists and with an inevitably stronger full orchestral presence. The pulse is more strongly forwardly pressing. This can be easily checked at any point but is very noticeable from the start of the 3rd movement, the rondo burlesque, where the burlesque element is more forceful. All of this is delivered with total assurance by the orchestra and absolutely no allowances have to be made for the players' relative youth or lack of long-term experience. It is arguable, of course, that these aspects of the players may have influenced Abbado's approach to the interpretation. Whatever the reason, there is a real choice to be made between the two interpretations.

The recording is very fine indeed and the Blu-ray version is a clear improvement. The camera work is fully involving for the viewer and provides crisp imaging with good colour rendition. The sound is very full and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. It offers a markedly more forward balance than that provided for the Lucerne version. This suits the different interpretation and is a very exciting alternative.

The differences between the performances are very significant in my view. There are two contradictory views on what this music is actually about and it seems to me that Abbado's performance here lays less stress on the death-obsessed views that are currently favoured (as described in the booklet interestingly). This is crucial to one's views of the symphony and to how one might react to these two differing performances.

The following is a fair resume of the opposing camps as regards the content or intentions behind this music:

There are two main competing views as to what this music is about. Mahler, at the time, had just completed two very successful seasons as conductor of The Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic and in his last letters said that he was looking forward to going on tour with the NYPO. In addition he had made considerable progress with his 10th Symphony. None of this suggests a man approaching imminent death and beset by such fears and possible anger as some would have it. On the contrary, it rather suggests a man at the top of his game and looking forward to his future life and continuing success. Indeed, this rather optimistic point of view is the one generally held and put forward by the eminent Mahler authority, Henri-Louis La Grange.

When we consider Mahler's own comments and those of his closest colleagues of the Second Viennese School we find that Mahler himself denied that there was any program to his symphonies and asked that they should be judged simply as pure music.

In addition, Berg described the 9th as `It expresses an extraordinary love of the earth, for Nature'.
Also Schoenberg had this to say ` [The Ninth] contains what may be termed objective, almost dispassionate statements of a beauty which will be perceived only by those who can dispense with visceral warmth and who feel comfortable in a climate of intellectual coldness'
