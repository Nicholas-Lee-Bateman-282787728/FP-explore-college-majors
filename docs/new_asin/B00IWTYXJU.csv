8645866,5,B00IWTYXJU,An excellent follow on from the series. Although if you had not seen the series a good stand alone movie. Sho Sakurai and Keiko Kitagawa work well together and Kippei Shiina provided the perfect humour. For those interested in J-Drama a must see.,1461369600,,246,4.744186046511628
