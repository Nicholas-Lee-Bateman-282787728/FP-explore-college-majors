8724971,5,B011RO8B30,"I felt compelled to comment on this Australian release of Assault on Precint 13 from Umbrella Entertainment , a simple but great 1976 action movie by John Carpenter. I will skip most of the story which I presume is well known by most readers. Suffice to say, this movie is about a few guys (two police officers and two convicts) who confront a crowd putting a siege to a Police Station when this was about to be closed and moved elsewhere in the city of LA. The movie is well paced, and fully uncut, meaning you have a disturbing scene of a little girl shot down. However, this scene is not gratuitous violence as it unleashes what came afterwards.  By all means, the movie has a superb soundtrack, John carpenters style. The main theme is particularly cool with heavy basses and an electronic style from the 1970s. The score is similar to some Carpenters subsequent projects, including Prince of Darkness, Escape from New York, or They Live.

Before getting this Umbrella Blu-ray release, I owned a Universal, region 2 (PAL) DVD release. I am glad I did it. The HD transfer really is a major improvement with. Darks scenes in particular are seen way better than in my DVD version. Technically, this Umbrella Blu-ray release comes in 16:9 widescreen format, so you see black bars on top and down of the screen. This is a PAL, but region free release, so it should plays in any region A Blu-ray player. Audio comes in English with no subtitles. Extras include an interview with John Carpenter and actor Austin Stocker. The movie runs for 91 minutes, 4 more than my Universal DVD release.",1480723200,,1586,4.640569395017794

John Carpenters, ""Assault on Precinct 13"" is a low budget tense and captivatingly resolute in its delivery. Carpenter's film was loosely based on an update of Rio Bravo. It ranks as a cult action classic and one of the filmmaker's best. It is a complex film, though it is not really about anything more intricate than a chill down the spine. A lot of its unnerving power comes from the kind of inexplicable, almost paranormal happenings, which one expects to find in a horror movie but not in a melodrama of this sort. In fact, there is not much more to the plot than that. This film is all about attitude and atmosphere.

The narrative is of two parts as we see one side of that plot, it has a message; explicitly that violence precipitates violence. It is rather telling that the director seems to disfavor the LAPD. When you contemplate that, the whole chain of events is generated by a combination of triggers. The situation here where by, six, gang members are coldly gunned down by faceless police officers. Then we have the other side of the narrative. This is about a small group of people who find themselves confined to an old run down Police station, which to all intense and purpose is closed and decommissioned. We have a newly qualified CHP police officer (The CHP has patrol jurisdiction over all California highways and can also act as the state police), a couple of secretaries, some prisoners and other civilians  who find themselves besieged in a precinct station on the edge of a rather desolate looking Los Angeles slum. What makes the film so effective is that the attackers seem to be as mindless (or very single minded in their pursuit of an injured man), and relentless, as with zombies  except they are adept at using semi-automatic weapons with silencers.

If the movie is really about anything at all, it is about methods of urban warfare and defense. Mr. Carpenter is an extremely resourceful director whose ability to construct films entirely out of action and movement makes his early work so very riveting, add to this his amazing OST, then is an indie film with steroids.",1459728000,2,2126,4.7196765498652296
