My 3 year old is in love with these characters from the book collection, so it only seemed fitting to also try out the DVDs. Autumn journey is PERFECT for this age group. Gives the child a chance to watch something innocent and age appropriate. She also loves watching Hidden Treasures. I enjoy the series because it is broken into episodes, so it makes it easy to limit how much she watches at a time. My 8 month old seems to enjoy watching Autumn journey as well! The colors are soft and not overly stimulating!",1477958400,,637,4.5

This movie is based off of the book Guess How Much I Love You, a much loved classic bedtime story written by Sam McBartney and illustrated by Anita Jeram.

Guess How Much I Love You: Autumn Stories  is about Little Nutbrown Hare and his friends who go on outings and learn lessons.. They explore and go on adventures such as building a spider web, collecting different things, playing fun games and enjoying themselves. There are many lessons to be learned in these episodes.  Kids can learn about team work, the importance of memory, using their imagination, perseverance and more!

I love all the animation! Autumn Journey is colorful, creative, detailed and it looks like its a water color. The main characters are all drawn with detailed lines and color. The scenery is really pretty. All the trees have bright autumn colored leaves and they even have details in their trunk lines.

My favorite character is Little Nutbrown Hare. He is so adventurous and playful. He loves his friends and helping his dad out. He is kind and a great role model. Little Nutbrown Hare explores the meadow with his friends, Little Grey Squirrel, Little Field Mouse,  Little Red Wood Fox and many more.

It is very sweet how every night Little Nutbrown Hare and Big Nutbrown Hare say how much they love each other. They try to compete with bigger reasons to describe the amount of love they have for each other. Normally stories are about a mom with the child sharing a bond. Here the dad is always there in the adventures telling Little Nutbrown Hare how much he loves him and this is a really nice change. It shows kids that both parents share equal love.

These short episodes are great bedtime stories to watch and enjoy during quiet family time. This movie is relaxing and full of fun plot lines that can help kids calm down and fall asleep. The sweet animation and story lines are perfect for when Mom or Dad are too tired to read a story out loud. I recommend this DVD for ages 3 to 6 and rate it 5 out of 5 stars because it is based on the classic books and is full of valuable lessons, great animation and heartwarming moments.

Big and Little Nutbrown Hare are back with friends Little Grey Squirrel and Little Field Mouse enjoying autumn adventures alongside them! Little Nutbrown Hare and his friends learn about the importance of memories, how to work together, using your imagination & completing tasks properly. They also learn about making priorities and the power of perseverance! The running time of this release is about 75 minutes. Stories on this disc include Spider's Web, The Collection, Autumn Journey, Cloudy Meadow, Autumn Play & Now You See Me. The first episode my 4 year old ever saw of this show was The Collection, and he was instantly hooked. The show, with it's simple but sweet subject matter and illustrations, has the perfect combination to draw in a curious kindergartner. My son enjoyed it so much he has asked for another release in this series for his birthday. If you have a 2-6 year old, I would definitely give this show a try!
