Rodney is a great teacher with good instructions and cueing for the poses and the DVD is very nicely done.

Based on this I will purchase other Rodney DVDs",1222992000,,271,4.0
3035385,5,B000YV1L4E,"I LOVE this video. VERY convenient with the 5, 20 minute workouts! Love it. Very refreshing. Rodney Yee is a great instructor and have loved him for years. He makes everything easy to understand.",1222214400,,195,4.764705882352941
3035386,5,B000YV1L4E,"I completely enjoyed doing these daily workouts.  I like that you can choose what you want to do and they are all less than 30 mins. My two favorites are the hip openers and twists, but they are all great! The scenery is awesome and Rodney's cues are perfect! They are easy enough for a new yogini to do and great for experienced yoginis!  You won't be disappointed with this.",1220313600,,376,4.357142857142857
3035387,5,B000YV1L4E,"I just did the first week of AM Yoga and I thought it was perfect. 20 mins before my morning routine, is just what I need. I can't wait to try the others. He is relaxing but challenging-the setting is beautiful too. I recc. this product.",1220054400,,237,4.173913043478261
3035388,5,B000YV1L4E,"This DVD is awesome, I did the first 20 min set and at the end I thought, that was not really a work out, but I fealt great. The next day, I was so sore, meaning it was a great work out too. love it.",1219104000,5,199,3.4444444444444446
3035389,4,B000YV1L4E,"If you are a procrastinator, busy or new to yoga, this is the best DVD you could possibly purchase to integrate yoga into your life. I'm a procrastinator and, while I always -want- to do yoga, I always find 800 things that need to be done instead. This DVD, though, presents 20-minute yoga sessions to be done in the morning. No more daunting 60 minute commitment. I can have my yoga, coffee and shower within an hour of waking up, causing no interruption to my routine.

The box claims that there is a bonus ""daily deep breathing and meditation guide"" but I can't find it (and I've done all of the sessions, so the bonus isn't like some secret level that gets unlocked when you complete all your missions). My suspicion is that the box is referring to Rodney Yee telling me to breathe as part of the routine instruction and doing relaxation work at the end. I consider that standard, however, and will continue to believe that there is, in fact, no bonus feature as claimed.",1217635200,14,975,4.508474576271187
3035390,5,B000YV1L4E,"We must confess that Rodney Yee is one of our favorite DVD-Yoga-Teachers. This DVD is great for three main reasons: 1) variety of routines = 5, 2) ability to have either detailed instruction or limited instruction, and 3) the routines are NEW. Gaiam has often repackaged routines from their library & so in the past you may have thought you were getting something new to add to your dvd library and you were actually getting something you already had. Very pleased with the purchase.",1216771200,175,483,4.761904761904762
3035391,5,B000YV1L4E,"In this DVD, you can do a different sequence each day of the week.  As I interpret the default order of the choices, they are just right for the five-day workweek:  standing poses to get your motor runnin' first thing Monday morning; backbends on Wednesday (over-the-hump-day) to counteract the effects of slumping over the computer; hip-openers on Friday to open you up after a week of being chair-bound.  The twists (Tuesday) and forward bends (Thursday) are delightful additions and could be done interchangeably.  Take advantage of extra time on the weekends to do more than one of the sequences.

On days that I prefer a more well-rounded morning practice, I do the A.M. portion of the Yee/Walden A.M./P.M. Yoga for beginners CD, then follow it up with a more targeted sequence from Yee's A.M. Yoga for Your Week.  That combination loosens me up and primes me for a more challenging workout later in the day, whether it be yoga, pilates, kickboxing, hiking, whatever.

Oh, and the cinematography is as breathtaking as the music is enchanting.  A delightful experience!",1216080000,189,1073,4.98876404494382
3035392,5,B000YV1L4E,"Rodney Yee's DVDs are all great, but this is my favorite because there are five 20-minute routines - one for each day of the week Monday through Friday. Though they are easy, they are beyond my current fitness level.  Nevertheless, the instructions are clear and I'm never encouraged to do more than I can.  I have never gotten injured while using a Rodney Yee DVD.",1215388800,14,365,4.6
3035393,5,B000YV1L4E,"This yoga dvd follows Gaiam's usual formula - beautiful scenery, voice-over instruction, and soothing background music.  A new feature is the ability to choose between detailed or minimal audio instruction - very nice once you've practiced the routine a few times.  The interview with Rodney Yee gives some good insight into his path toward yoga.  The best part is the routines themselves.  New yoga concepts are presented, not just a re-packaging of  the many titles featuring Rodney Yee that you may have seen and practiced.  He offers advice during the routines that seems small but makes the poses work so much better.
The twists segment is my favorite.",1213228800,258,657,5.037037037037037

3035417,1,B000YV1L4E,"I am done with Rodney Yee videos. Many years ago when I first started with Yoga he was the first DVD I bought and it was a 90-minute session and it was past my ability. Since then I acquired a lot of DVD's including ones that would ease me into Yoga. Now I am at a point I feel comfortable doing more challenging routines and felt like giving Rodney Yee another shot; that was a waste of money. Don't like his instruction, can barely follow him, always full speed ahead, to put it bluntly not to my liking.

I know people recommend his videos all over, but my experience with two of his DVD's were not good ones.",1494806400,,612,4.186440677966102

3035420,5,B000YV1L4E,"Everything about this dvd is superb; Rodney Yee's voice-over provides just enough explicit direction as he demonstrates each pose. Pacing is just right, the amount of material in each section is short enough to fit into a busy person's schedule and still comprehensive enough to be a meaningful experience. Production values are superb; breathtaking Glen Canyon views in the background, subtle, non-intrusive music that adds to the narration. I haven't done Yee's other dvds yet, but could work with this one for some time and gain from it each time.",1489968000,,550,5.122222222222222

It's short enough to fit into my busy schedule but long enough so I can feel the benefits. I tried another DVD but she was rushy, hyper & way too perky.  This is my 2nd purchase of this same DVD (my grandson broke my 1st one) & I also bought one for a friend. Thank you for carrying this, I can't find him in stores.

There are 5 different,, self contained (ie warm up, yoga, meditation/relaxation),  20 minute options: Standing Poses, Forward Bends, Back Bends, Twists and Hips.  It's just the perfect amount of time to get loose before work, and it uses simple poses so anyone can do it without breaking into a sweat and needing a shower.

3035439,4,B000YV1L4E,"I like Rodney Yee's narration - his instructions do well to help correct or improve a pose.  I also like that these are short routines with different focuses for variety (about 20 minutes each, themes of standing poses, twists, back bends, forward bends and hip openers).  I find the poses feeling rushed at times and some of the poses a little difficult for a stiff person like me - not enough warm up in the routine for a few poses but generally good.  I actually prefer this for later in the day not in the a.m. because I'm even stiffer then and more likely to get injured in these poses if I don't do them just right.",1468195200,,621,4.2905982905982905
3035440,5,B000YV1L4E,"One of my favorite dvds by Rodney so far.  5 sessions all 20 minutes each that are split up into focus ie, hip openers, forward bends, standing poses etc.  Very nice to add to my normal 30 general session.",1465776000,,205,4.230769230769231

3035444,5,B000YV1L4E,"This is my go to yoga dvd.  Though the yoga is not advanced, it is just enough sometimes.  The dvd has 5 routines (standing, twists, backband, forward bend and hip openers).  They each run about 20-25 minutes.  Each routine has a specific focus.  I do one of the routines at least once a day and not always in the AM.  Sometime the evening is a perfect time to unwind your body from a busy day.  Depending on how my body feels determines which routine I do.  The routine's audio is a voice over.  Rodney always looks so serene in the routines since he is not distracted by talking.  My first dvd got a scratch so I ordered a replacement.

3035448,4,B000YV1L4E,"I love this DVD!  I use it twice daily, once in the morning and once at night.  Some of the routines are a little difficult for first this in the morning, but they work well at night when I am more pliable.  I'm sure as I continue to work through the practices, I will be able to do them in the mornings more easily.  I really enjoy all Rodney Yee DVDs.",1462147200,,353,3.9295774647887325

Also, this is the second DVD from Gaiam that is missing a workout. This DVD claims there is a bonus meditation and breathing guide, but it is certainly not there. False advertising and very frustrating.",1453248000,,338,4.633333333333334
3035468,3,B000YV1L4E,"I don't have a strong feeling about this DVD. It didn't wow me or underwhelm me. It just is. Be warned, these workouts are definitely not 20 min. They are slightly longer, which needs to be accounted for when doing a morning workout as most of us have somewhere to be. A review I read on here said they were distracted whenever he would say ""buttocks flesh"", which is admittedly a rather odd expression. However, I found the way he said ""legs"" (said like, ""LAAAAY-ggs"") much more distracting since he says it every 4 words. Either way, it works to give me some relaxation and stretching before I start my day. It doesn't make me sweat so that I would need to shower, which is nice, but sometimes I'd like a tougher workout since I'm trying to lose weight.",1452729600,,755,4.438848920863309
3035469,4,B000YV1L4E,"Coming from a background of practicing yoga for about 6 years now - a variety of disciplines and varied lengths of practices, I have come to enjoy what this weekly series has to offer. I do not like classes and love practicing by myself either in my home or outside when weather permits. I follow many podcasts/teachers and I am a fan of Rodney's calm and steady voice and his instructions. He strikes a nice balance between giving you things to think about and the time to do it.

I've done morning yoga for the past year, straight, now. It hasn't been Gaiam or Rodney. And it's mainly been two routines - I would mostly do the same exact one every morning at 5:45am - but it has left me with a narrow vision on my practice and agitated shoulder muscles in my body. They're great routines, full body, TONS of chaturangas. But doing the same one, because I'm VERY particular about my practice, has brought me to a place I don't want to be in.

So several weeks ago I gave these a try. At first, I thought they were very odd and echo what many people have reviewed - they're odd as routines and don't feel too much like they're actually meant for ""just out of bed"" practicing. But I gave them a chance. And I enjoy them. After a full week of doing each specific session, I feel more well-rounded. You can tell they're not just a series of poses for each day as there are counterposes at the end and a gentle wind down into shavasana. They may be subtle to those who are beginners but they're there.

My advice: not the best option for those brand new to yoga; someone who is comfortable and knowledgable of all standard poses. Do the full week and keep your sights on the big picture, not the small one (which I had previously done). Don't nitpick each individual day. Look at all of the specific practices you're doing after a whole week. Also, take the poses easy. Every instructor tells you to go deeper or fold farther - but this is a morning practice and you don't necessarily need to do that. Go easy on your body if you're practicing first thing. And if you feel that Rodney isn't instructing you through AM yoga? Think about how you can make it soft and gentle the next time you hit Play. *Make it* AM yoga for yourself then. Why not, right?

Is it my DVD player or is there a programming problem with this video? Any help will be appreciated.

I prefer routines that incorporate all of these, giving a more full body workout. I don't get how these are specific for the morning, either. His yoga for beginners video is much better for this, and has an ""energizing"" routine (great for the morning); I would recommend that one over this.",1416528000,,466,4.765432098765432

I have been practicing yoga for over 15 years and I think this selection is great for beginners as well as intermediate yogis. Rodney Yee does an excellent job of teaching, keeping you grounded, reminding you to breathe and often cuing with just the right words to give you a visual of what needs to be done to get the pose correct.
I finally got my husband to try yoga with this DVD and I'm purchasing another for a Christmas gift for my mom who I've also converted to the fine art of practicing yoga. Whether you are a seasoned yogi or someone looking to try yoga for the first time, you can't go wrong with Rodney Yee. I also recommend and own Yee/Walden A.M./P.M.

He does not explain the moves well and, since you're in yoga poses, you can't always see what he's doing on the screen so, unless you want to watch and memorize the video first, it's more than a bit frustrating. I've been working out to videos for over 12 years now so I'm not a novice to the general concept or to yoga specifically so I'm speaking from a relative perspective. Denise Austin has much better alternatives as does Gaiam. About the best thing I can say is there's some pretty footage of the western U.S. in the video.

I work a factory job lifting on average 20-40lb bags to a belt and I would ache when I come home. I knew I did not lift correctly due to my entire life up to now of poor posture. So, the pain was disappearing because Rodney taught me how to carry myself correctly, no doctors or physical therapy needed. Truly amazing method and input, so easy to follow. The standing poses were some of the best things I can know. On top of all that, his personality is very earnest, and for me his voice is very familiar and comforting with the slight accent it is like my dad or uncle is talking to me, it just seems right to learn yoga from him ;)",1395532800,5,796,4.044303797468355

There are several great morning workouts depending on what your focus is... stretching, bending, floor exercises, etc. One of the staple yoga workout DVDs for anyone wanting to start or continue your yoga practice at home.",1393804800,,385,4.676470588235294

3035596,4,B000YV1L4E,"I expected to love this but found it just okay.  I do like the different options for audio (full instruction, some instruction, just music).  There wasn't a lot of flow to these poses and there was no delineating of warm up poses or an intro and the rest of the routine.  I can see using these 20-minute routines after going through some sun salutations on my own but for me just doing a few twists or front bends without a more comprehensive practice doesn't feel right.",1392681600,,471,4.453488372093023
3035597,5,B000YV1L4E,I end up feeling like I did way more than 20 minutes at the end of these sessions. Rodney Yee has a great style which is easy to follow and very well stated.,1392163200,,157,3.787878787878788
3035598,1,B000YV1L4E,"I'm not an exercise video fan and never really did Yoga with the video.  If video exercise is your schtick, then this would be fine.  Didn't really care for Yee, either.",1392076800,,169,4.419354838709677

3035601,3,B000YV1L4E,"I am usually a big fan of Rodney Yee's videos as he is good about the mind/body connection where many other yoga teachers.. take a more Western body sculpting.. push student approach which is not what yoga is really about.  AM Yoga for Your week, offers 5 varying routines of practice.

I find that I like to alternate between his AM/PM yoga video which I prefer daily and then maybe a day or two of some of the videos on AM for the week.  I personally really like the hip openers, while some of the forward bend routines might not be right for everyone, esp. older practicers.. it moves a little faster than I like to keep mind/body connected.  I like sun salutations at a much slower pace connecting breath to asanas.  Since these routines are geared for about 20 minutes.. it just feels that Rodney rushes to try get a lot in..

I don't like yoga that feels rushed. Which is why I give it only  3 stars.  But if you are looking for a few new ideas for adding to your routine it might be worth the purchase.

3035603,5,B000YV1L4E,This is a great workout for building flexibility and relieving stress at the beginning or end of the day.  It is nice and short which makes it doable.  I love the hip flexor segment the best as that area is rarely stretched throughout a typical day.,1390176000,,249,4.391304347826087

3035605,5,B000YV1L4E,"This is my favorite yoga tape, ever.  The production quality is great, the setting is beautiful, and Ye gives incredibly fine, detailed instruction that is physically based rather than New-Agey lame.  No mention of opening chakras or self acceptance breathing- just solid, scaffolded poses that are actually effective.  The 5 practices are unique and can be done am or pm.  I like that they are only 20 minutes long, so I can pop one on while waiting for dinner to finish.  I'd like to find a longer practice, too, so I will be buying more of his tapes soon.",1387756800,,558,4.595959595959596

3035607,5,B000YV1L4E,Rodney Yee's Beginner yoga was excellent and this DVD continues the trend.  Each day focuses on 20 minute routines to start off your day right.,1385856000,,143,4.72
3035608,5,B000YV1L4E,Use this video every week.  Rodney Yee gives such clear direction. Perfect for a morning wake up. 5 different practices focusing on different areas.,1384819200,,148,5.166666666666667
3035609,5,B000YV1L4E,Love this DVD. I often give this workout to individuals considering Yoga because the workouts are not difficult and they are short-only 20 minutes each. There are five great workouts on the DVD.,1384646400,,194,4.909090909090909
3035610,4,B000YV1L4E,Very good video with ability to choose which area of the body to work on. Some of the positions are a bit challenging for beginners (like me).,1383696000,,142,4.296296296296297

3035612,3,B000YV1L4E,Old version of AM/PM Yoga was better. More relaxing. Better over-all stretch. If the old one still exists I'd like to find it. I bought another version and it is better than this one but still not like the first.,1383523200,,212,4.325
3035613,5,B000YV1L4E,"Personally I like variety in life and also with my yoga practice.  This collection offers 5 workouts focusing on different areas of the body that can be done daily, in order as suggested in the morning or you can live dangerously and select any one of them you wish any time of day.  Rodney Yee's selections are good for beginners as well as those entering into a more intermediate practice. As always his instruction is clear and consistent which I find to be important if you listen and pay attention, as you know, it takes time to find the correct positions, thus that is why we practice. It's as close to having a physical yoga instructor by your side. In this respect you will receive the benefits of bringing the body, mind and spirit into alignment whatever level you are in.",1383264000,,782,4.539007092198582
3035614,4,B000YV1L4E,"I'm really happy with this DVD. Rodney Yee is a very helpful instructor, and the outdoor setting is calming and inspiring, better than a studio or a garden. I appreciate that each of the five workouts is targeted to specific areas of the body and types of movement, so I can pick and choose depending on how I feel that morning. The variety also makes it much more interesting and challenging; only a few poses get repeated. I like how they're separate and short, but others may wish there was an option for turning them into one long workout. I haven't really enjoyed the hip workout, maybe it's just my body, so that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.",1383091200,,650,4.425

3035616,5,B000YV1L4E,"PROs:
-Has 5 different 20 minute practices.
-Each practice has a specific focus: standing poses, twists, backbends, foreward bends, and hip openers.
-The practices are great for beginner/advanced beginner and intermediate yogis. The poses can be modified for different fitness levels.
-Each practice is well-rounded with thorough warm up time and shavasana/meditation at the end of each practice.
-The flow from one pose to the next is very well choreographed with little in between pose movement.
-The music is PERFECT! This yoga DVD has the most relaxing and inspiring music I have heard on a yoga DVD.
-The setting is stunning. The atmosphere of the wide open desert is breathtaking, awe-inspiring and the perfect thing to wake up to! I feel so inspired doing yoga with this scenery, I feel like I am there in the wide open spaces.
-Rodney Yee gives excellent and highly detailed direction.
-I have had this DVD for about a year and I still use it nearly everyday. I don't always use it in the morning, the practices are good for any time of day. The point is I love it so much I am STILL not tired of it! I have a whole stack of yoga DVDs and this is one that I continue to use very frequently while others just collect dust.
-Rodney gives excellent guided meditations at the end of each practice. Each meditation is different and relates to the specific practice.

CONs:
-Sometimes Rodney's instructions are so detailed that I am not sure what he means. How do I ""release my muscles away from the bone""? Not sure what he means by that.",1381449600,10,1540,4.661764705882353
3035617,2,B000YV1L4E,"This isn't really a work out.  It's very relaxing, and seems to help alleviate some tension in my lower back and hips. AND he always says ""Buttocks Flesh"" in a funny way which breaks my concentration and makes me laugh.  I much prefer the post-natal yoga routine on my Element Pre and Post Natal yoga video - it's much more challenging, yet still relaxing.",1381104000,,356,4.546875
3035618,5,B000YV1L4E,Perfect for a quick workout. More of a beginner yoga session. Keeps me stretched out and limber. Rodney Yee is always excellent,1380672000,,127,4.818181818181818
3035619,5,B000YV1L4E,One of my favorite work outs because we work out different routines for five days and only 20 minutes.  Still like it but probably like Ultimate Power Yoga better.  It is a little bit more challenging.,1380067200,,201,4.555555555555555
3035620,5,B000YV1L4E,I love Rodney Yee - his voice is very calming without putting you to sleep.  Morning program is all 20 minutes each so I can always find time to squeeze it in.,1379894400,,159,3.96875
3035621,5,B000YV1L4E,"I was a total newb when I started this. A complete beginner.

A beautiful start to the day, Rodney is a charismatic and charming male personality which is a rare find for me in this field. Rodney's 'extras' are a rewarding and inspiring watch.

I never felt that he was showing off, nor that I was being tested. A gentle start to the day with complete instruction delivered in voice over style so that he never sounds strained - take notes other Yoga video producers.

There are three audio tracks, the default is 'Beginner' in which all manoeuvres and how you should be feeling, constant feedback reassuring the correct positioning and most importantly - breathing.

Finally, I must mention the dramatically beautiful setting, high quality direction and editing, fantastically appropriate musical score and the most superbly thought out day by day breakdown of a highly complex subject.

I have never written a serious review on Amazon, I felt compelled.

Thank you Rodney et al.

One negative - I have this automatically play on my computer each morning and the 'Gaiam' logo sound is too loud.",1379808000,,1095,4.886486486486486
3035622,5,B000YV1L4E,I use this DVD almost daily.  The sessions are only 20 minutes so i do a pre-video stretch and my post video meditation.  It has such an excellent variety of yoga series and each one very effective if only just 20 minutes.  Rodney Yee's voice is very easy to follow and listen to; very clear and succinct.  Highly recommended for all levels of yoga.,1379721600,,349,4.40625

The instruction is clear, the pace is appropriate and easy to follow, and the voice, background music and nature-based surroundings are calming. In contrast to Beginner's Yoga DVD, this one is not littered with promos, so you can get directly to the point and pick your favorite routine without having to watch long ads of sports equipment beforehand. I find that the routines complement each other and provide different challenges for every day of the work week.

I ordered this dvd after borrowing the A.M/P.M. Yoga (with Yee and Walden)... I wanted something that I could practice each day of the work week without getting bored. This yoga routine is perfect for the work week. There are five sequences, each 20 minutes long. If you are familiar with Gaiam this dvd follows the same set-up as the other Yee dvd's, beautiful settings, calming music, and voice-over instructions. An added bonus to this dvd is that you can set up the audio as minimal instruction further allowing you to meditate and focus on the poses.

I would consider myself a beginner in Yoga and I found this program to be perfect by itself or combine with other Yee dvd's.",1374537600,2,779,4.36551724137931

The workouts are just the right amount of effort for us non-morning people. Back Bends (Wednesday) is probably the toughest, but each session only lasts 20 minutes, and ends with Relaxation pose to put you in the right frame of mind to start your day.

I would highly recommend these, especially if you are new to waking up and working out first thing. After years of trying and failing to get up and moving in the morning, I think we've finally found something that ""stuck"".",1360108800,4,677,4.408

3035669,5,B000YV1L4E,"I've been doing yoga for years, but have struggled to do it regularly, on a consistent basis.  Most yoga classes and DVDs are 45-60 minutes long.  And I think that's great if you have that time available; I unfortunately cannot commit to that long of a session every day at this point in my life.  Maybe down the road.

Rodney Yee is by far my fav DVD instructor.  He's obviously quite flexible & accomplished being an instructor, but he emphasizes to not push yourself too hard, listen to your body.  Pushing too hard is something alot of people do when beginning yoga to try and keep up with the instructor, so I really appreciate that he says throughout all 5 of the workouts to do what feels right for your body.

I also love that, although it's a concise 20-minute yoga session, you feel like you've been in a regular 60 minute class, as far as the benefits you reap.

I highly recommend this for beginner's, those with injuries, anyone who can't commit to a daily 60-min yoga practice but still wants to practice, or anyone really!  I'll definitely be purchasing more of Rodney Yee's yoga DVDs.",1358380800,,1100,4.543147208121828

For example, there are backbends, but they are all together, and to get any standing moves you have to go back to the menu and choose it.  If you are looking for an all around (floor to standing) workout this is not the DVD for you.  Also Rodney is a pretzel and doesn't show any modifications to the moves, and I in general found this DVD very difficult to follow.",1357084800,6,515,4.224489795918367

I started to gain weight so me and my friends who were also mothers, formed our circle of Yoga. We had allotted one hour each day to meet up and do Yoga. I was assigned to come up with the instructional DVD. When I searched Amazon, I came across this A.M. yoga for your week.

It was my first time to do yoga but all my other friends had tried. They also loved the DVD. They said that the routines were much different from the other DVDs that they had. All in all, the routines were extremely flexible and new.

I highly recommend this Yoga DVD.",1356652800,,714,4.056737588652482

Each specifies which body part it will be emphasizing in the workout  Like hips, back, etc. Provides a nice variety and very good instructions on what you should be feeling(stretching) and when.

Not a bad thing at all...just don't think you can do all of these poses on day 1 of your yoga practice.,1351382400,,379,3.935064935064935

I no longer have to twist/turn trying to see what moves are being performed. His cuing is amazing and I understand what my body is supposed to be doing. I've had chronic back pain over the last few months which physical therapists have contributed to my hip flexors. I find the Forward Bend and Hip Openers an excellent remedy to combat some of this pain I have been experiencing (PT got too expensive!). My only wish is that the programs were longer. So, I ordered a collection of his Power Yoga that is due to be here tomorrow! Can't wait and am so thankful I stumbled across this Yoga instructor.",1341878400,,725,4.5

3035692,5,B000YV1L4E,"This is a wonderful yoga DVD, as are most of Rodney Yee's.  I suppose if you were a very advanced yogi, this would be too basic for you, but for anyone in the beginner to intermediate range, it's a lovely way to wake up your body if you only have a short amount of time to practice in the morning.  I've been practicing yoga for about 2-3 years now, and find that I can move deeper into the poses on days when I wake up feeling limber and vivacious, or can just follow the basics on mornings when that's not the case.  Each of the 5 workouts is quick, about 20-25 minutes, and feels like just enough of a means to wake up my body and clear my mind for the day to come.  For the price (think I paid $5.98), it can't be beat!  Rodney's voice is soothing yet encouraging; just what a non-morning person like me needs first thing.",1336608000,3,826,4.105590062111801
3035693,5,B000YV1L4E,"I've had this DVD for awhile and never written a review for Amazon. I felt this deserves my first review. This is a great teaching tool for anyone wanting or needing to get into yoga.
I was in martial arts for 30 years. You would think a martial artist wouldn't need yoga- WRONG! I was tight in my hips and low back. I have knee, hamstring and shoulder problems all stemming from years of abuse, accidents, and the ""I'll never die"" syndrom. Yoga has helped in all these. I have tried some other peoples' DVD's and keep coming back to Rodney Yee.
Although Rodney has longer DVD's I like the 20 minute sessions in the morning. They help the day get off to a good start. They will show you your weak areas and bound up areas. Rodney talks you through the moves in a calm, never hurried way. After doing them a few times, you don't even have to watch it. Just listen to him and the calm background music.
The only thing that would have helped me more is doing yoga sooner in my life.
I would also suggest getting some knowledge about and purchasing a foam roller.
The two go hand in hand at my house.
EDIT- Apparently I was wrong on never having written a review. I forgot I wrote one for some speakers- duh- sorry.",1335312000,19,1211,4.269565217391304
3035694,5,B000YV1L4E,"I love this DVD so much that I'm debating buying a second copy since I'm always annoyed when I'm at work and mine is at home or vice versa. Most of my DVDs that have multi workouts only have 2 or 3 at the most that I like. I really love 5 for 5 of these. I especially love the hip opener segment as I can't find any other short programs that focus on hip openers. I usually play this DVD at noon time at work when I don't have time for a class or a long workout but I can always grab 20-25 minutes. On the lucky days I get to do 2 for 45 minutes.

At home I generally will pick other longer and harder DVDs, but I still find I want this one whenever I'm in the mood for another 20 minutes of something specific like twists or standing poses or backbends or hip openers. I'd rate this DVD as advanced beginner or lower intermediate.

This is typical Rodney Yee -- beautiful scenery, his very soothing voice, no unnecessary chatter, good suggestions for improving the pose just a tad and very logical sequences on the poses. I love that I rarely even need to look at the screen now. I can just listen and know exactly what to do as his cueing is so excellent.

I wish I could find another teacher I like this much so I could buy all of his/her DVDs too. I think I have all but 2 of Yee's as I so love his style.",1335052800,11,1309,3.96958174904943

I have been using it for a month. I have already seen very significant improvement. I have averaged five days of use per week. I very much appreciate the different focus of the five sessions. I have no comparison points, but strongly recommend this dvd and yoga in  general. I can only imagine the benefits after doing the yoga for six months.",1332028800,,537,4.702127659574468

The camera angles weren't that helpful and often too close to see how the poses were being formed. The 20 minute segments were just the right length for a morning session. I found navigating between the different workouts a bit of a trial. Maybe I just have a duff disc. He has an amazing body, is very fit and I got the impression this was more about him than about me. The location was wonderful and made me think about booking a holiday but as for improving my yoga - well........Maybe I'm being harsh and should probably give another one a chance.

IF YOU NEVER DID YOGA then this is the right video, otherwise you're better off with ANYTHING else. It isn't a workout or a yoga session, its a series of 20mn poses in which the instructor goes over the details for each pose.

3035699,3,B000YV1L4E,"Hey folks, don't get me wrong, I love Rodney Yee, but if you are relatively new to yoga this video is probably not for you.  I am not a raw beginner, I know a lot of poses, have attended a few classes, etc. I got this video because I have used Rodney's AM/PM Yoga for Beginners with Patricia Walden.  I only ever did the A.M. portion with Rodney as I personally find Patricia annoying.  However, the section that I did was actually a bit too easy for me.  So, I went on the hunt for something else.

This video appealed to me partly because it's for 5 days of the week, the workouts are pretty short (I like to do yoga and then something else or vice versa), I liked that it focused on part of the body each day, and it said GENTLE ENOUGH FOR BEGINNERS.  I find this to be a big fatty lie.  As other reviewers have noted, particularly for the morning, it's fairly intense.  There is no warm-up or meditation, it launches straight into the practice.  Part of the reason I do yoga is because my flexibility is terrible.  This video moves quite quickly, and while I do enjoy a challenge, I need to know modifications on poses. This video offers no modifications - except periodically to tell you you can use a strap which I usually knew already anyway.  Fortunately, I have Rodney Yee's book 'Moving Towards Balance' which shoes poses and their variations so I could pause and look stuff up.  However, had this not been the case I probably would have given up on the video.

Also, the backbend section of the video - I could easily see someone hurting themselves with this if their abdominal muscles are not strong enough to adequately support their back.

I give this 3 stars largely for just the kind of false advertising.  I just don't think it's a good choice for a lot of beginners.  I think if I was further along in my practice I would probably enjoy it.",1329264000,7,1858,4.357558139534884

This is perfect in so many ways. 1-5 different routines, each focusing on a different aspect; 2-20 minutes; 3-ends with relaxation and meditation; 4-Great scenery and a QUIET ease into the day; 5-BEST of all Rodney's quiet, unobtrusive, guidance that is so specific-and clear-you get the nuances one would normally only receive one-on-one in a class. Guess I need to add a 6th-RESULTS.

It is very meditative and he challenges you to think of your practice in a new way, for example, breathe into your low back.  I've been using this for over a year and I still love it.  It makes a wonderful gift.  I was trying to buy it tonight at Target for a friend but they didn't have it.  :(  It is also a great value with 5 workouts.

If you are looking for a full routine, this is not the video to choose. For me with work and time constraints, it became increasingly difficult to fit yoga.

The workouts themselves have a great variety.  I am no yogi, but I find them a great way to start a day that I know is going to be stressful.  Each workout has its challenging pieces, but with repetition it is interesting to see your body become more skillful in the poses that at one time were difficult or impossible.",1318032000,2,623,4.421052631578948
3035712,5,B000YV1L4E,"I had bought Rodney Yee's Yoga for beginners, and I was skeptical at first. It is perfect! I have a so much going on in my life (working full time, school part time, wedding planning, plus other misc. events) and I was looking for yoga that calmed my mind and my body that did not take forever to complete. Losing weight is the secondary benefit. I bought the A.M. yoga because there are 5 exercises on it, all focusing on different poses/exercises. All five are broken up so you can do different exercises on different days if you so choose, or all in one day. I am not very flexible (yet) but this really helps. After I do any one of these exercises I feel ready to take on the day and I can even fit this into my hectic schedule (no more than 25 minutes for any of them). The only thing I recommend is if you are new to yoga, research some of the poses first and find poses that you are able to do were you can get the most out of the workout without straining yourself. If you are looking to lose weight fast, I do not recommend this to you. Some of the poses are simple for a person who has been practicing yoga for quite sometime and is looking for a little more of a challenge. But if you are starting out, like me, and you are just looking for a little peace in your morning routine, this is something I would recommend to anybody.",1317945600,4,1339,4.134099616858237
3035713,5,B000YV1L4E,"The obvious disclaimer in reviewing yoga DVDs is the style of yoga and level of difficulty will vary so widely amongst users.

I have 4 of Rodney's discs and my favorite by far is ""A.M. Yoga."" Five very nice vinyassa style practices, all 20-minute each which happens to be perfect for me. I know GAIAM is naturally into marketing and trying to come up with new incarnations of Rodney Yee discs, but frankly I would love another disc EXACTLY like ""A.M. Yoga."" While sequels may not always work in Hollywood, I think it would work with ""A.M. Yoga."" There are MANY other Rodney Yee discs for people who want something else, but GAIAM should consider another discs of Rodney Yee himself filmed in a beautiful setting doing 20-minute vinyassa practices.",1317168000,,748,4.753846153846154

They don't tell you that some videos require props - like a block for the hip openers for example.
The part I like the least is Rodney Yee's spiel in the beginning. It's distracting: corny, preachy, and poorly lit.
In contrast, the yoga itself is filmed beautifully with breathtaking scenery.

Add to that Rodney Yee's wonderful calm voice and serene visage, and you leave the work out feeling both tranquil and invigorated.  I am not an advanced yoga practitioner, but I have been doing yoga for several years so don't consider myself a beginner.

My muscles became so tight that I began to look like Quasimodo.  It was like a little demon bit into my shoulder and neck.  So I got physical therapy, which helped but is painful.
  O.K. I've hiked out in Utah and Arizona so I got this DVD.  After a week of doing the yoga I didn't have to schedule my painful physical therapy sessions.  No more quasimodo.

Rodney Yee DVD's are how I started my home practice and I continue to use his products and expand my yoga practice in the Iyengar method of yoga. I purchased this DVD to help develop a morning practice and have it provide variety. Every practice on the DVD is fantastic for each morning. Since practicing to this about a month ago, I have just felt better each and every day. The practices are not complex or difficult, but provide a great vehicle through which to open your body in different ways. I like how the five different practices are sequenced to start easy and then build to allow you to wake up, so to speak. Then after work I will practice to his Yoga Conditioning for Athletes or Strength Building Yoga. Great for any beginner or intermediate level yogi if you are looking for something to provide a great start to your day and/or add some different variety to your home practice.",1304208000,5,938,4.459302325581396
3035721,4,B000YV1L4E,"This DVD in essence contains five short (around 20 minute each) routines, each focusing on a different type of activity. There are standing, twists, backbends, forward, and hip openers. They are meant to be quick morning routines for the times you don't have more time for a more in depth yoga session. In addition you get an interview with Rodney Yee and the ability to change the vocal track from full to abbreviated.

The routines were fairly easy, a good way to start a day. The backgrounds in western canyons were quite lovely.

I do enjoy Rodney Yee a lot, so that was a plus.

On the downside, first, there's a forced intro discussion that you have to skip past every single time you play the DVD. That's just silly. That could have been in there as an option on the main menu if you wanted to see it. There's no reason to watch that every single time you want to do a workout.

Next, the routines don't warn you up front what you'll need for it. You're going along, enjoying the routine, and suddenly he pulls out a strap! If you weren't ready, you have to pause and run and get one. He does that with a block as well.

He doesn't mirror you - what you see on the screen is the opposite of what you yourself are doing. While that doesn't matter for the more basic poses like tree pose, when he gets into the twists that makes things quite challenging. I would much rather have seen him mirror me.

I like that at the end when he goes into ""relaxation pose"" (he won't call it Corpse Pose) that the music is quiet and then stays that way as the DVD goes around to the main menu again. With some DVDs you're laying there relaxing and then the DVD pops to energetic music which ruins the mood.

I wish he'd done a more full job of describing some poses though. Even in the ""verbose"" version he is brief in helping you get into a position and it can be challenging to figure out exactly what he is looking for. Of course the brief version of the soundtrack is even worse :) By then you better have the routines memorized.

Well recommended, but it'd be nice for them to tweak this a bit to work out some of the minor issues.",1303084800,4,2127,4.260545905707196
3035722,5,B000YV1L4E,"This has turned out to be my favorite yoga DVD--I often use it in the mornings when I don't have a lot of time before I go to work.  The routines do move fast, so sometimes I pause the DVD and hold poses a little longer or do some yin poses after these routines are over.  There are 5 different routines---standing poses, forward bends, twists ,back bends and hip openers.  The backbend one is my least favorite.  Overall, well done and routines that I will use over and over again to jump start my morning.  It might be a good idea to do a little warm up before getting started because Rodney does just jump right in and he moves pretty fast.",1301788800,,643,4.237704918032787
3035723,5,B000YV1L4E,"I never feel as good for the rest of the day as I do after finishing one of these five 30-minute  sessions. Ideal for an advanced beginner/intermediate practice, Yee's insightful commentaries---almost as if he knows when you're forgetting to breathe, clenching your jaw, or pushing too hard with a hand in a twist---make it seem at times like you're in a class with an attentive teacher who offers minor corrections to improve your poses and help you get more out of them. When finished, I feel simultaneously at ease and invigorated to face the day. I hope Yee is working on a Volume II, since rotating through the five ""episodes"" goes by pretty quickly, and as much as I enjoy doing them, every day now for several months, I'd be happy for the next level that pushes a bit further.

This DVD is exceptional for me in that 1) I feel wrung out of all toxins after each session, 2) the routines feel especially well structured leaving a special sense of wholeness and stability after moving through the sequenced poses Yee has choreographed, 3) the landscape of Arizona's red canyon is exquisite and nourishing for the eyes/soul/spirit during the practice, 4) the pacing and focus/grounding seems especially perfected among all his DVD practices. Each section is about 20 minutes and focuses on an entirely different pose type, yet after doing just one section your entire body feels well balanced and stabilized. Eventually, I will begin doing multiple segments at one sitting, but the idea is to work through all throughout the week so by week end each focus has been really worked. It's a great plan, transformative, should be part of preventative health programs everywhere. I mix it with Rodney Yee's Meditation DVD, which takes the bite out of urban living. I actually got up more than two hours earlier this morning to do his practice, since his intro requests you go to bed earlier and wake earlier and start each day with his practice. I'm feeling like that plan is an excellent program for long-term inner peace and productivity! Many Many Thanks, Rodney Yee!!",1296691200,3,1427,5.0
3035737,5,B000YV1L4E,"I started doing yoga watching a free Rodney Yee video on my cable company's OnDemand channel.  I stuck with it for several weeks, gradually increased my flexibility, and as long as I did it 2-3 times per week I never had back trouble.  That is really saying something, since I routinely throw out my back.  I don't know the exact reason why this works but it really does.  So after trying a live yoga class for a while, I had to go back to video since the only time I can work out is at 6am and none of the yoga studios where I live are open then.  So I bought A.M. Yoga because Rodney had been good to me and it turns out the Twists segment was the one from OnDemand -- SCORE!  I think all 5 of these roughly 20mn segments are good and I usually combine 2 in a row for a full morning workout.  One bonus feature: you can switch the audio setting to Minimum Commentary, which strips out all of the stuff about the ""sacrum"" (whatever that is), etc. and basically just tells you which pose to move to while you groove to the new age soundtrack.  Doing this makes you realize how long Rodney makes you hold each pose and helped me concentrate more.
The DVD's interview with Rodney is actually kind of funny because he talks about how his Chinese dad didn't think highly of his gymnast/ballerina/yoga instructor son's chosen profession until the son started making more money than the rest of the family.

Fortunately, I've just found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Core-Cross-Train/dp/B000YV1L44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga - Core Cross Train</a>, which addresses the missing element of ""AM Yoga for Your Week.""

AM Yoga contains five short workouts (around 25 minutes) suitable to do at home in the morning before you go to work. This is the only reliable time I have to exercise, and I simply don't have time for a 60 to 90 minute workout. Each of the five workouts focuses on one aspect of flexiblity, and each contains a secondary emphasis on strength using isometric exercises. The first is standing poses (for overall flexibility and balance), the second is forward bends (flexbility in your hamstrings and back), the third is for flexibility in the hips, the fourth is backbends to open your shoulders & upper back & chest, and the fifth is twists (looser movement).

Taken together, these five workouts are almost (oh-so-close) to being ballanced. But after doing these AM Yoga workouts most mornings for about 6-months (yes, really!), I noticed that while most of my body felt better and more flexible, my upper back still felt relatively tense and inflexible and often tense by the end of the day. Intermediate workouts (e.g., focusing on the plow or headstand) focus on the right area, but there is a large jump in flexibility from AM Yoga to a headstand.

It was so hard to live with the everyday pains and aches to the point that I was beginning to believe that it was all in my head and that I am crazy. After finally discovering that I had pelvic floor muscle spasm i was at last started on the right physical therapy exercises and massage. My physical therapist recommended Rodney Yee's AM yoga. Section five of the DVD is the pelvic openers part- I just can't find the words to describe how much great help it has provided me along with my PT exercises.

3035773,4,B000YV1L4E,"You won't find many surprises in these five 20-minute yoga sequences, just solid sequencing of bedrock poses--not a bad thing in my book. The pace of each practice is moderate, with medium length holds of poses (a possible exception is the repeated cycles within the hip opener sequence, which some may find a bit quick). Despite the short time frame and leisurely pace, each sequence manages to pack a surprisingly good selection of asanas within its particular theme: standing poses, twists, backbends, forward bends, or hip openers. The standing sequence is fairly standard, but each of the other series is more creative. Twist incorporates reclining, standing, and seated twists. The backbend sequence is dynamic and graceful. The forward bend sequence includes both standing and seated asanas. The hip opener series works repetitively and progressively. Sequences can be strung together for a longer practice, but only manually. The music is pleasant and unobtrusive, mostly wind instruments with some drums. The scenery is typical Gaiam-beautiful.

I don't notice anything especially ""A.M."" about the sequences--they can each be done at any time. If anything, all but the more fluid backbend sequence could use a warm up, so time permitting, I do a few sun salutations first, or start with backbends when linking multiple sequences. The ""full instruction"" audio track assumes some knowledge of the asanas, and consists mostly of cues for moving between postures and helpful alignment reminders within each pose. There is also a ""minimal instruction"" audio track that is nice once the sequence is familiar. Some asanas reappear in a number of sequences, allowing for increased familiarity and progress over time. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Spanish language audio track as well, well translated and cued in a pleasant voice that matched Rodney Yee's own rather nicely.

Overall, this is a decent addition to my yoga library, which I use mostly for quick fixes, lazy days, or as a stretch or cool down after a workout. I am an early intermediate yoga practitioner, but can see this being of use to most levels of practitioners, from slightly advanced beginners (those with basic familiarity of the asanas) on.

TWISTS: Reclined Mountain, Reclined Bent Knee Single Leg Twist, Reclined Bent Knee Double Leg Twist, Reclined Single Leg Stretch, Down Dog, Standing Forward Bend, Single Bent Legged Down Dog Twist, Crescent Lunge, Standing Forward Bend, Cobbler's Pose Forward Bend, Seated Wide Angle Forward Bend, Simple Cross-legged Twist, Sage Twist, Half Fish Twist, Cobra, Relaxation.

I was expecting to have 5 days worth of yoga rotines.

A few weeks after surgery I bought the excellent ""am & pm stretch"" with Madeleine Lewis and finally feel ready to step it up a notch.  If you've never ever done yoga before this might not be the best DVD to start with (take a class) but it's not too advanced even for a gimp like me.  I like the variety and that each segment feels like a complete practice ending with relaxation pose.  These aren't really flow practices; each pose is held for a good few seconds which helps me a lot, and Rodney's voiceover instructions add remarkable insight into the pose.  You can also choose minimal instruction if you prefer.  He seems a lot more relaxed here than in earlier DVDs and gives an interesting interview.  You'll need a mat, block, strap, and bolster or folded blanket but aren't told which until you're into the routine.  An entire segment can be completed in under a half hour, including turning on the TV, navigating the menus, and unfolding/refolding your mat.  Highly recommended.",1249689600,6,1101,4.658031088082901

(that means there are 5 routines) I like the fact that they can be done one session at a time OR I double, even triple them up and do really long sessions.

Rodney doesn't tell you how to modify the positions if you can't get into them though but they are all fairly basic even for a home yogi like me!,1240531200,3,477,4.053191489361702

My only criticism is that neither the box nor the dvd warns you that you will need minor pieces of equipment.  The very first time I settled in for the second session, I was surprised in the middle of the routine when Rodney pulls out a strap and acts as if I should have known that this was required.  I'd have preferred to have been told before the routine began like on the Wii My Fitness Coach which I love, or at least on the box so I could have the materials ready.

This DVD features five all new (not re-worked from other workouts) 20-25 minute long routines. As stated in the title they are meant to be done in the ""AM"" I however did the routines at night. Usually before I went to bed as a way to unwind at the end of the day. This worked especially well because each workout has a short relaxation segment at the end.

This is also wonderful for people like myself who don't have a lot of time or struggle to get motivated for a one hour workout. Everyone can find 20 minutes somewhere in their day to join Rodney in Glen Canyon Arizona, on a beautiful sunny day for a little Yoga.

DVD includes five 20-25 minute workouts. Full or Minimal instruction (great feature)
Standing poses, Twists, Backbends, Forward Bends, Hip Openers.

3035794,5,B000YV1L4E,"Rodney Yee has had some hits and some misses in his yoga DVDs but mostly the former, in my book. Despite the occasional DVD that did not work, I think of him as a wonderful teacher, in fact he is one of my favorites.

I don't like philosophy mixed in with physical yoga. Because of the mind+body aspect of the origins of yoga, often a new age talk track accompanies the physical yoga on DVDs. The issue with this is that every teacher of yoga has their own interpretation of the philosophy behind yoga and frequently this seems, at least to me, very different from my own readings and interpretation. So although I think yoga is holistic, I don't find yoga DVDs of physical asana practice the best medium to impart simultaneous spiritual/philosophical ideology.

One of the reasons I like Rodney Yee is that he sticks to physical yoga. His talk track is form and alignment cues. Yee usually has a minimalist instruction style that is best suited for those who have some prior experience of yoga and want a DVD to follow along but not to really ""learn"" yoga asana. Another reason I like Yee is that his yoga is ""classic"" and yet features interesting combinations.

AM Yoga for your Week is a bit of a departure from Yee's minimal talk track style. He provides extensive and wonderfully helpful cues. Despite some years of yoga practise I discovered help with some sticky points from his cues in my forward bends. Full marks to the DVD for cueing. It should work well for beginners and beyond as its audience.

Before I ordered the DVD I had read that each 20 minute session had a separate focus - twists, backbends, forward bends, standing poses, hip openers. I typically do longer sessions of yoga with a bit of everything for what I consider a balanced practise. Forward bends are effective counter poses to backbends and so on. I wondered how separating the focus would work. I find it works very well as put together by Yee. Yee sets up with prep work before getting into the deeper poses and finishes with asanas that work as effective counter poses although they are not the typical choices. Doing 20 minutes with a specific focus each day is working as well for me as doing a long session twice a week that incorporates all the categories.

This DVD is particularly useful to busy people who cross train and want to do yoga apart from other forms of exercise like strength training and cardio. The 20 minute format is easy to tag on after another workout or as an independant yoga session in the morning if you do some other stuff in the evening.

The special feature of an intervew with Yee was enjoyable. I have often worndered what attracted him to Yoga since he says so little in his other DVDs. Hearing him explain in his sincere and understated style was good. He seems to have a good sense of humor.",1237420800,5,2812,4.547430830039525
3035795,5,B000YV1L4E,"Rodney Yee is the perfect instructor. Even on video, his instructions on how to get into the poses are easy to follow. That is most important in yoga. Great video!",1236643200,,163,4.466666666666667
3035796,5,B000YV1L4E,"I do yoga regularly, with Yoga for Regular Guys being my main choice.

3035809,5,B000YV1L4E,"Rodney Yee, a veteran yoga instructor as well as the featured instructor of many yoga videos and DVDs, has recently released this new offering, AM Yoga for Your Week.  The intent was to provide five 20-minute practices (but note that the actual practice times vary from 22-26 minutes) which could be used during busy weekday mornings to get the day off to a good start.  In reality, these five excellent yoga sessions, each of which has a different focus, are appropriate for use at ANY time of the day.  Although each individual practice revolves around a specific body area/group of postures, each are well-rounded, stand-alone yoga sessions.  I have described the five practices briefly below.

STANDING, 22.5 minutes
Standing postures include standing forward bend, tree, triangle, side angle pose, warrior 1, and warrior 2; standing forward bend is performed in-between some of these poses.  The standing poses conclude with chair and wide-legged standing forward bend before moving to the floor for hero and then finishing in relaxation pose.  Yee offers some particularly nice form pointers while holding the standing poses.

TWISTS, 26 minutes
This practice opens with a series of reclined twists (one of which uses a strap).  Yee then transitions to standing with down dog and standing forward bend for revolved prayer twist and crazy dog.  Coming back to seated in cobbler's pose, he performs a twist in wide-legged seated pose and two variations on Sage 3 posture.  This practice finishes with half Lord of the fishes, cobra, and relaxation pose.

BACK BENDS, 25 minutes
Yee starts here by rolling two blankets together to create a bolster for under the upper back; he lies over this for a gentle lying backbend.  Coming to standing, he moves through a variation on sun salutations which include standing backbend, chair, down dog, warrior 2, side angle, warrior 1, and crescent lunge.  He then moves to the floor for cobra, bow, and camel.  After finishing with the backbending work, Yee nicely stretches out the body with cobbler's pose, simple seated twist, reclined leg stretch (using a strap if needed); he finished with relaxation pose.

FORWARD BENDS, 24 minutes
This practice begins in a reclined position for a series of moves that felt more like hip openers than forward bends:  reclined leg stretch (using a strap if needed), happy babies pose, and thread-the-needle.  Next Yee gradually transitions to standing through child's pose, down dog, standing forward bend, wide angle standing forward bend, and 3-legged down dog.  Coming back to the floor for seated forward bends, he performs a simple cross-legged forward bend, head-to-knee pose, full seated forward bend, cobbler's forward bend, and wide-legged forward bend, finishing with a brief rest and then relaxation pose.  To my surprise, this segment was probably my favorite, as it had a great mix of postures.

HIP OPENERS, 26 minutes
This segment uses a yoga block.  It starts with a seated opening vinyasa in which Yee flows from staff pose to cobbler's to wide-legged seated pose, gradually speeding this up and also adding half-boat pose.  He next does a simple cross-legged forward bend before incorporating the block.  Keeping one leg stretched straight out in front, he first rests the other knee on the block, then brings the knee out to the side at a right angle.  He also uses the block for cobbler's pose with the block between the feet.  Additional postures which follow include pigeon, revolved crescent lunge, double pigeon, half Lord of the fishes, wide-legged seated forward bend, and cobbler's forward bend.  The practice concludes with lightning pose, hero's pose on the block, and relaxation.

Despite Yee's long history of making yoga videos, he has still managed to offer something that feels fresh and new here.  As always, his cueing is impeccable (although mirrored cueing would be even better!), and he offers wonderful form pointers which help you to get into the postures more deeply.  Although I wouldn't recommend this DVD for those brand-new to yoga (Yee doesn't give quite that level of instruction), more experienced beginners and beyond should do fine.  In conclusion, the practices are amazing, the instructor is extremely skilled, and the scenery is breathtaking--what's not to like?  Highly recommended!",1231977600,153,4319,5.160919540229885
3035810,5,B000YV1L4E,"I've never been a fan of Rodney Yee's DVD's as I preferred more flowing type of yoga (like Shiva Rea) but I really love this one. It has 5 excellent 20-25 minute yoga practices that concentrate on different poses : standing , twists , backbends , forward bends and hip openers. every practice feels complete even though it's barely 25 minutes , each one ends with shavasana. Rodney Yee has great and detailed instruction , the scenery is beautiful and the music is good , now it's my most used DVD and it's a great as add ons to other workouts or for days you don't feel like working out but want a little stretching after a long day.

3035811,5,B000YV1L4E,Excellent video that offers a lot of helpful comments throughout the various poses. For those of us new to yoga it is a great way to learn and for those with experience I suspect it offers useful reminders about self-awareness in the poses. I've recommended it to several fellow runners looking to balance their running routines.,1229385600,,329,4.892857142857143
3035812,3,B000YV1L4E,"Well the scenery is beautiful, but I wasn't thrilled with the presentation. I thought it would be 5 mini-sessions modeled after Gaiam's ""AM & PM yoga dvd"" that I love and recommend to everyone. That DVD had a 20 minute full body session that warmed you up, had great hip openers, back bends, twists, etc and had a bit of meditation at the end. I thought this DVD would be like that one, having a warm up and a meditation for each, but focusing on different areas/stretches each day. It's not. When you start, say, the ""hip openers"" selection, Rodney Yee is already warmed up and going super fast for someone who just woke up (it is AM yoga after all, and I get up at 4:45 AM) then he slows down later but by then you are all frazzled and trying to keep up and the whole idea of starting your day with some tranquility and a nice little stretch is out the window. The stretch is there, but I am recovering from an injury so I need the warm up so that I don't re-injure myself. I guess I could do a warm up before the DVD, but I bought the DVD for this purpose so I guess I'm a little disappointed... Plus, they say it is 5 - 20 minute sessions, but they are closer to 30 minutes each, which is nice to get more than you expected, but not when you're trying to get out the door on time! I guess I'm back to the same routine from ""AM & PM yoga"" every day w/ Rodney.",1228694400,174,1362,4.048148148148148
3035813,3,B000YV1L4E,"The workout/yoga segments in this DVD are organized in a way that is very odd (and not very good).  From the Main Menu, you can choose:  Standing Poses OR  Twisting poses OR back-bends, etc.  Each segment lasts about 20 minutes.  To go from one 20-minute segment to another, you have to go back to main menu and select a different set of poses.

There is no ""combined workout"" or option to do an integrated workout/session.  There are also no segments longer than 20 minutes.  So if you want some variety and/or a longer session, this DVD will not really help you.  I found this approach to organizing the sessions to be very odd, and not conducive to a well-rounded, seamless morning workout.

If I had know this was how they did this DVD, I would not have bought it, and unfortunately, I cannot say I recommend this DVD.",1227916800,14,822,4.493243243243243

I look forward to it each morning, and if I miss it in the morning I hurry home from work and do it at night instead. I am buying yoga sets and this DVD for all my friends for Christmas. 20-25 minutes is just the right amount of time for me. However, I don't have much to compare it to other than some hour long BORING classes at the gym.",1227916800,,414,3.8255813953488373
3035815,4,B000YV1L4E,"I got this DVD as a gift.  At first I wasn't very excited about it.  I usually do longer yoga DVD's in the morning.  I feel guilty when I do my 35 minute routine instead of my 50 minute routine, I was concerned that the 20 minute Rodney Yee routine wouldn't be enough.  But I do yoga every morning and I also do aerobic at night.  So some mornings I am fatigued and I need to do a shorter routine.  These are perfect.  I alternate between the routines and I am always so surprised that I get the kind of work out I do in twenty minutes.  The routines are slow and Rodney Yee's voice is very soothing.  You relax yourself into these stretches and you don't even realize that you are working as hard as you are.  When you finish you can really feel the limberness and strech from the routine.

The scenery is beautiful, The voice over is soothing and easy to understand and it gives you plenty of warning before you change positions, The routines are not difficult, but they are effective.  I would reccomend this as a good addition to other routines that you already do. I would not use this as my only source of exercise.",1226275200,,1121,4.260663507109005

I really like that each segment focuses on a different group of yoga poses--forward bends, back bends, twists, etc.  Rodney Yee's voice is soothing and his vocal guidance during a pose helps me to be sure I am getting the most out of it.

The practices are perfect for my mornings - they wake me up better than coffee and after doing them, I feel stretched, relaxed and ready to start my day. The poses are not particularly difficult, which I think is important for a morning practice when you're still quite stiff and uncoordinated, increasing the risk of injuring yourself. 5 individual programs will prevent me from getting bored.

3035818,5,B000YV1L4E,"Normally I do this in the afternoon - perhaps a yogic faux pas? Or maybe just defiance...

My favorites are ... Hip Openers, then Twists, and once in awhile Backbends.  So I tend to do only those three and skip the Forward Bends & Standing Poses - I'm kinda lazy - plus I get enough of them when I do Yoga for Athletes (also by Rodney Yee) - I alternate between that DVD and this one but I'm looking to branch out and try another instructor too! At this point I don't have a whole lot of yoga experience but I love this DVD & would highly recommend it for toning, stretching, etc.  I always end up sweating at least a little!",1223424000,,625,4.10655737704918

3269886,4,B000YV1L4E,"If you are a procrastinator, busy or new to yoga, this is the best DVD you could possibly purchase to integrate yoga into your life. I'm a procrastinator and, while I always -want- to do yoga, I always find 800 things that need to be done instead. This DVD, though, presents 20-minute yoga sessions to be done in the morning. No more daunting 60 minute commitment. I can have my yoga, coffee and shower within an hour of waking up, causing no interruption to my routine.

The box claims that there is a bonus ""daily deep breathing and meditation guide"" but I can't find it (and I've done all of the sessions, so the bonus isn't like some secret level that gets unlocked when you complete all your missions). My suspicion is that the box is referring to Rodney Yee telling me to breathe as part of the routine instruction and doing relaxation work at the end.

3269888,5,B000YV1L4E,"In this DVD, you can do a different sequence each day of the week.  As I interpret the default order of the choices, they are just right for the five-day workweek:  standing poses to get your motor runnin' first thing Monday morning; backbends on Wednesday (over-the-hump-day) to counteract the effects of slumping over the computer; hip-openers on Friday to open you up after a week of being chair-bound.  The twists (Tuesday) and forward bends (Thursday) are delightful additions and could be done interchangeably.  Take advantage of extra time on the weekends to do more than one of the sequences.

On days that I prefer a more well-rounded morning practice, I do the A.M. portion of the Yee/Walden A.M./P.M. Yoga for beginners CD, then follow it up with a more targeted sequence from Yee's A.M. Yoga for Your Week.  That combination loosens me up and primes me for a more challenging workout later in the day, whether it be yoga, pilates, kickboxing, hiking, whatever.

Since then I acquired a lot of DVD's including ones that would ease me into Yoga. Now I am at a point I feel comfortable doing more challenging routines and felt like giving Rodney Yee another shot; that was a waste of money. Don't like his instruction, can barely follow him, always full speed ahead, to put it bluntly not to my liking.

I also like that these are short routines with different focuses for variety (about 20 minutes each, themes of standing poses, twists, back bends, forward bends and hip openers).  I find the poses feeling rushed at times and some of the poses a little difficult for a stiff person like me - not enough warm up in the routine for a few poses but generally good.  I actually prefer this for later in the day not in the a.m. because I'm even stiffer then and more likely to get injured in these poses if I don't do them just right.",1468195200,,621,4.2905982905982905

They each run about 20-25 minutes.  Each routine has a specific focus.  I do one of the routines at least once a day and not always in the AM.  Sometime the evening is a perfect time to unwind your body from a busy day.  Depending on how my body feels determines which routine I do.  The routine's audio is a voice over.

They are slightly longer, which needs to be accounted for when doing a morning workout as most of us have somewhere to be. A review I read on here said they were distracted whenever he would say ""buttocks flesh"", which is admittedly a rather odd expression. However, I found the way he said ""legs"" (said like, ""LAAAAY-ggs"") much more distracting since he says it every 4 words. Either way, it works to give me some relaxation and stretching before I start my day. It doesn't make me sweat so that I would need to shower, which is nice, but sometimes I'd like a tougher workout since I'm trying to lose weight.",1452729600,,755,4.438848920863309
3269966,4,B000YV1L4E,"Coming from a background of practicing yoga for about 6 years now - a variety of disciplines and varied lengths of practices, I have come to enjoy what this weekly series has to offer. I do not like classes and love practicing by myself either in my home or outside when weather permits. I follow many podcasts/teachers and I am a fan of Rodney's calm and steady voice and his instructions. He strikes a nice balance between giving you things to think about and the time to do it.

I've done morning yoga for the past year, straight, now. It hasn't been Gaiam or Rodney. And it's mainly been two routines - I would mostly do the same exact one every morning at 5:45am - but it has left me with a narrow vision on my practice and agitated shoulder muscles in my body. They're great routines, full body, TONS of chaturangas. But doing the same one, because I'm VERY particular about my practice, has brought me to a place I don't want to be in.

So several weeks ago I gave these a try. At first, I thought they were very odd and echo what many people have reviewed - they're odd as routines and don't feel too much like they're actually meant for ""just out of bed"" practicing. But I gave them a chance. And I enjoy them. After a full week of doing each specific session, I feel more well-rounded. You can tell they're not just a series of poses for each day as there are counterposes at the end and a gentle wind down into shavasana. They may be subtle to those who are beginners but they're there.

My advice: not the best option for those brand new to yoga; someone who is comfortable and knowledgable of all standard poses. Do the full week and keep your sights on the big picture, not the small one (which I had previously done). Don't nitpick each individual day. Look at all of the specific practices you're doing after a whole week. Also, take the poses easy. Every instructor tells you to go deeper or fold farther - but this is a morning practice and you don't necessarily need to do that. Go easy on your body if you're practicing first thing. And if you feel that Rodney isn't instructing you through AM yoga? Think about how you can make it soft and gentle the next time you hit Play. *Make it* AM yoga for yourself then. Why not, right?

In the forward bend routine when he routinely throws that leg up and pulls it straight into the air, some of us may need a little help there Rodney.

3270049,3,B000YV1L4E,"I love Rodney Yee's videos, my problem with this one is that the five practices are divided by pose styles: standing poses, twists, back bends, forward bends, and hip openers. I prefer routines that incorporate all of these, giving a more full body workout. I don't get how these are specific for the morning, either. His yoga for beginners video is much better for this, and has an ""energizing"" routine (great for the morning); I would recommend that one over this.",1416528000,,466,4.765432098765432

My favorite thing is that the practices are only 20 minutes long--I have young children and have had 2 babies since getting the DVD so this fits perfectly with my life. I have been practicing yoga for over 15 years and I think this selection is great for beginners as well as intermediate yogis. Rodney Yee does an excellent job of teaching, keeping you grounded, reminding you to breathe and often cuing with just the right words to give you a visual of what needs to be done to get the pose correct.
I finally got my husband to try yoga with this DVD and I'm purchasing another for a Christmas gift for my mom who I've also converted to the fine art of practicing yoga. Whether you are a seasoned yogi or someone looking to try yoga for the first time, you can't go wrong with Rodney Yee. I also recommend and own Yee/Walden A.M./P.M.

He does not explain the moves well and, since you're in yoga poses, you can't always see what he's doing on the screen so, unless you want to watch and memorize the video first, it's more than a bit frustrating. I've been working out to videos for over 12 years now so I'm not a novice to the general concept or to yoga specifically so I'm speaking from a relative perspective. Denise Austin has much better alternatives as does Gaiam. About the best thing I can say is there's some pretty footage of the western U.S. in the video.

I work a factory job lifting on average 20-40lb bags to a belt and I would ache when I come home. I knew I did not lift correctly due to my entire life up to now of poor posture. So, the pain was disappearing because Rodney taught me how to carry myself correctly, no doctors or physical therapy needed. Truly amazing method and input, so easy to follow. The standing poses were some of the best things I can know. On top of all that, his personality is very earnest, and for me his voice is very familiar and comforting with the slight accent it is like my dad or uncle is talking to me, it just seems right to learn yoga from him ;)",1395532800,5,796,4.044303797468355

There wasn't a lot of flow to these poses and there was no delineating of warm up poses or an intro and the rest of the routine.  I can see using these 20-minute routines after going through some sun salutations on my own but for me just doing a few twists or front bends without a more comprehensive practice doesn't feel right.",1392681600,,471,4.453488372093023

3270098,3,B000YV1L4E,"I am usually a big fan of Rodney Yee's videos as he is good about the mind/body connection where many other yoga teachers.. take a more Western body sculpting.. push student approach which is not what yoga is really about.  AM Yoga for Your week, offers 5 varying routines of practice.

I find that I like to alternate between his AM/PM yoga video which I prefer daily and then maybe a day or two of some of the videos on AM for the week.  I personally really like the hip openers, while some of the forward bend routines might not be right for everyone, esp. older practicers.. it moves a little faster than I like to keep mind/body connected.  I like sun salutations at a much slower pace connecting breath to asanas.  Since these routines are geared for about 20 minutes.. it just feels that Rodney rushes to try get a lot in..

I don't like yoga that feels rushed. Which is why I give it only  3 stars.  But if you are looking for a few new ideas for adding to your routine it might be worth the purchase.

No mention of opening chakras or self acceptance breathing- just solid, scaffolded poses that are actually effective.  The 5 practices are unique and can be done am or pm.

3270104,5,B000YV1L4E,Rodney Yee's Beginner yoga was excellent and this DVD continues the trend.  Each day focuses on 20 minute routines to start off your day right.,1385856000,,143,4.72
3270105,5,B000YV1L4E,Use this video every week.  Rodney Yee gives such clear direction. Perfect for a morning wake up. 5 different practices focusing on different areas.,1384819200,,148,5.166666666666667
3270106,5,B000YV1L4E,Love this DVD. I often give this workout to individuals considering Yoga because the workouts are not difficult and they are short-only 20 minutes each. There are five great workouts on the DVD.,1384646400,,194,4.909090909090909
3270107,4,B000YV1L4E,Very good video with ability to choose which area of the body to work on. Some of the positions are a bit challenging for beginners (like me).,1383696000,,142,4.296296296296297

3270109,3,B000YV1L4E,Old version of AM/PM Yoga was better. More relaxing. Better over-all stretch. If the old one still exists I'd like to find it. I bought another version and it is better than this one but still not like the first.,1383523200,,212,4.325
3270110,5,B000YV1L4E,"Personally I like variety in life and also with my yoga practice.  This collection offers 5 workouts focusing on different areas of the body that can be done daily, in order as suggested in the morning or you can live dangerously and select any one of them you wish any time of day.  Rodney Yee's selections are good for beginners as well as those entering into a more intermediate practice. As always his instruction is clear and consistent which I find to be important if you listen and pay attention, as you know, it takes time to find the correct positions, thus that is why we practice. It's as close to having a physical yoga instructor by your side. In this respect you will receive the benefits of bringing the body, mind and spirit into alignment whatever level you are in.",1383264000,,782,4.539007092198582
3270111,4,B000YV1L4E,"I'm really happy with this DVD. Rodney Yee is a very helpful instructor, and the outdoor setting is calming and inspiring, better than a studio or a garden. I appreciate that each of the five workouts is targeted to specific areas of the body and types of movement, so I can pick and choose depending on how I feel that morning. The variety also makes it much more interesting and challenging; only a few poses get repeated. I like how they're separate and short, but others may wish there was an option for turning them into one long workout. I haven't really enjoyed the hip workout, maybe it's just my body, so that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.",1383091200,,650,4.425

3270113,5,B000YV1L4E,"PROs:
-Has 5 different 20 minute practices.
-Each practice has a specific focus: standing poses, twists, backbends, foreward bends, and hip openers.
-The practices are great for beginner/advanced beginner and intermediate yogis. The poses can be modified for different fitness levels.
-Each practice is well-rounded with thorough warm up time and shavasana/meditation at the end of each practice.
-The flow from one pose to the next is very well choreographed with little in between pose movement.
-The music is PERFECT! This yoga DVD has the most relaxing and inspiring music I have heard on a yoga DVD.
-The setting is stunning. The atmosphere of the wide open desert is breathtaking, awe-inspiring and the perfect thing to wake up to! I feel so inspired doing yoga with this scenery, I feel like I am there in the wide open spaces.
-Rodney Yee gives excellent and highly detailed direction.
-I have had this DVD for about a year and I still use it nearly everyday. I don't always use it in the morning, the practices are good for any time of day. The point is I love it so much I am STILL not tired of it! I have a whole stack of yoga DVDs and this is one that I continue to use very frequently while others just collect dust.
-Rodney gives excellent guided meditations at the end of each practice. Each meditation is different and relates to the specific practice.

CONs:
-Sometimes Rodney's instructions are so detailed that I am not sure what he means. How do I ""release my muscles away from the bone""? Not sure what he means by that.",1381449600,10,1540,4.661764705882353
3270114,2,B000YV1L4E,"This isn't really a work out.  It's very relaxing, and seems to help alleviate some tension in my lower back and hips. AND he always says ""Buttocks Flesh"" in a funny way which breaks my concentration and makes me laugh.  I much prefer the post-natal yoga routine on my Element Pre and Post Natal yoga video - it's much more challenging, yet still relaxing.",1381104000,,356,4.546875
3270115,5,B000YV1L4E,Perfect for a quick workout. More of a beginner yoga session. Keeps me stretched out and limber. Rodney Yee is always excellent,1380672000,,127,4.818181818181818
3270116,5,B000YV1L4E,One of my favorite work outs because we work out different routines for five days and only 20 minutes.  Still like it but probably like Ultimate Power Yoga better.  It is a little bit more challenging.,1380067200,,201,4.555555555555555
3270117,5,B000YV1L4E,I love Rodney Yee - his voice is very calming without putting you to sleep.  Morning program is all 20 minutes each so I can always find time to squeeze it in.,1379894400,,159,3.96875
3270118,5,B000YV1L4E,"I was a total newb when I started this. A complete beginner.

A beautiful start to the day, Rodney is a charismatic and charming male personality which is a rare find for me in this field. Rodney's 'extras' are a rewarding and inspiring watch.

I never felt that he was showing off, nor that I was being tested. A gentle start to the day with complete instruction delivered in voice over style so that he never sounds strained - take notes other Yoga video producers.

There are three audio tracks, the default is 'Beginner' in which all manoeuvres and how you should be feeling, constant feedback reassuring the correct positioning and most importantly - breathing.

Finally, I must mention the dramatically beautiful setting, high quality direction and editing, fantastically appropriate musical score and the most superbly thought out day by day breakdown of a highly complex subject.

I have never written a serious review on Amazon, I felt compelled.

Thank you Rodney et al.

One negative - I have this automatically play on my computer each morning and the 'Gaiam' logo sound is too loud.",1379808000,,1095,4.886486486486486
3270119,5,B000YV1L4E,I use this DVD almost daily.  The sessions are only 20 minutes so i do a pre-video stretch and my post video meditation.  It has such an excellent variety of yoga series and each one very effective if only just 20 minutes.  Rodney Yee's voice is very easy to follow and listen to; very clear and succinct.  Highly recommended for all levels of yoga.,1379721600,,349,4.40625

The instruction is clear, the pace is appropriate and easy to follow, and the voice, background music and nature-based surroundings are calming. In contrast to Beginner's Yoga DVD, this one is not littered with promos, so you can get directly to the point and pick your favorite routine without having to watch long ads of sports equipment beforehand.

I ordered this dvd after borrowing the A.M/P.M. Yoga (with Yee and Walden)... I wanted something that I could practice each day of the work week without getting bored. This yoga routine is perfect for the work week. There are five sequences, each 20 minutes long. If you are familiar with Gaiam this dvd follows the same set-up as the other Yee dvd's, beautiful settings, calming music, and voice-over instructions. An added bonus to this dvd is that you can set up the audio as minimal instruction further allowing you to meditate and focus on the poses.

I would consider myself a beginner in Yoga and I found this program to be perfect by itself or combine with other Yee dvd's.",1374537600,2,779,4.36551724137931

The workouts are just the right amount of effort for us non-morning people. Back Bends (Wednesday) is probably the toughest, but each session only lasts 20 minutes, and ends with Relaxation pose to put you in the right frame of mind to start your day.

I would highly recommend these, especially if you are new to waking up and working out first thing. After years of trying and failing to get up and moving in the morning, I think we've finally found something that ""stuck"".",1360108800,4,677,4.408

And I think that's great if you have that time available; I unfortunately cannot commit to that long of a session every day at this point in my life.  Maybe down the road.

Rodney Yee is by far my fav DVD instructor.  He's obviously quite flexible & accomplished being an instructor, but he emphasizes to not push yourself too hard, listen to your body.  Pushing too hard is something alot of people do when beginning yoga to try and keep up with the instructor, so I really appreciate that he says throughout all 5 of the workouts to do what feels right for your body.

I also love that, although it's a concise 20-minute yoga session, you feel like you've been in a regular 60 minute class, as far as the benefits you reap.

I highly recommend this for beginner's, those with injuries, anyone who can't commit to a daily 60-min yoga practice but still wants to practice, or anyone really!  I'll definitely be purchasing more of Rodney Yee's yoga DVDs.",1358380800,,1100,4.543147208121828

I started to gain weight so me and my friends who were also mothers, formed our circle of Yoga. We had allotted one hour each day to meet up and do Yoga. I was assigned to come up with the instructional DVD. When I searched Amazon, I came across this A.M. yoga for your week.

It was my first time to do yoga but all my other friends had tried. They also loved the DVD. They said that the routines were much different from the other DVDs that they had. All in all, the routines were extremely flexible and new.

I highly recommend this Yoga DVD.",1356652800,,714,4.056737588652482

Each specifies which body part it will be emphasizing in the workout  Like hips, back, etc. Provides a nice variety and very good instructions on what you should be feeling(stretching) and when.

I no longer have to twist/turn trying to see what moves are being performed. His cuing is amazing and I understand what my body is supposed to be doing. I've had chronic back pain over the last few months which physical therapists have contributed to my hip flexors. I find the Forward Bend and Hip Openers an excellent remedy to combat some of this pain I have been experiencing (PT got too expensive!). My only wish is that the programs were longer. So, I ordered a collection of his Power Yoga that is due to be here tomorrow! Can't wait and am so thankful I stumbled across this Yoga instructor.",1341878400,,725,4.5

3270189,5,B000YV1L4E,"This is a wonderful yoga DVD, as are most of Rodney Yee's.  I suppose if you were a very advanced yogi, this would be too basic for you, but for anyone in the beginner to intermediate range, it's a lovely way to wake up your body if you only have a short amount of time to practice in the morning.  I've been practicing yoga for about 2-3 years now, and find that I can move deeper into the poses on days when I wake up feeling limber and vivacious, or can just follow the basics on mornings when that's not the case.  Each of the 5 workouts is quick, about 20-25 minutes, and feels like just enough of a means to wake up my body and clear my mind for the day to come.  For the price (think I paid $5.98), it can't be beat!  Rodney's voice is soothing yet encouraging; just what a non-morning person like me needs first thing.",1336608000,3,826,4.105590062111801
3270190,5,B000YV1L4E,"I've had this DVD for awhile and never written a review for Amazon. I felt this deserves my first review. This is a great teaching tool for anyone wanting or needing to get into yoga.
I was in martial arts for 30 years. You would think a martial artist wouldn't need yoga- WRONG! I was tight in my hips and low back. I have knee, hamstring and shoulder problems all stemming from years of abuse, accidents, and the ""I'll never die"" syndrom. Yoga has helped in all these. I have tried some other peoples' DVD's and keep coming back to Rodney Yee.
Although Rodney has longer DVD's I like the 20 minute sessions in the morning. They help the day get off to a good start. They will show you your weak areas and bound up areas. Rodney talks you through the moves in a calm, never hurried way. After doing them a few times, you don't even have to watch it. Just listen to him and the calm background music.
The only thing that would have helped me more is doing yoga sooner in my life.
I would also suggest getting some knowledge about and purchasing a foam roller.
The two go hand in hand at my house.
EDIT- Apparently I was wrong on never having written a review. I forgot I wrote one for some speakers- duh- sorry.",1335312000,19,1211,4.269565217391304
3270191,5,B000YV1L4E,"I love this DVD so much that I'm debating buying a second copy since I'm always annoyed when I'm at work and mine is at home or vice versa. Most of my DVDs that have multi workouts only have 2 or 3 at the most that I like. I really love 5 for 5 of these. I especially love the hip opener segment as I can't find any other short programs that focus on hip openers. I usually play this DVD at noon time at work when I don't have time for a class or a long workout but I can always grab 20-25 minutes. On the lucky days I get to do 2 for 45 minutes.

At home I generally will pick other longer and harder DVDs, but I still find I want this one whenever I'm in the mood for another 20 minutes of something specific like twists or standing poses or backbends or hip openers. I'd rate this DVD as advanced beginner or lower intermediate.

This is typical Rodney Yee -- beautiful scenery, his very soothing voice, no unnecessary chatter, good suggestions for improving the pose just a tad and very logical sequences on the poses. I love that I rarely even need to look at the screen now. I can just listen and know exactly what to do as his cueing is so excellent.

I wish I could find another teacher I like this much so I could buy all of his/her DVDs too. I think I have all but 2 of Yee's as I so love his style.",1335052800,11,1309,3.96958174904943

I have been using it for a month. I have already seen very significant improvement. I have averaged five days of use per week. I very much appreciate the different focus of the five sessions. I have no comparison points, but strongly recommend this dvd and yoga in  general. I can only imagine the benefits after doing the yoga for six months.",1332028800,,537,4.702127659574468

The camera angles weren't that helpful and often too close to see how the poses were being formed. The 20 minute segments were just the right length for a morning session. I found navigating between the different workouts a bit of a trial. Maybe I just have a duff disc. He has an amazing body, is very fit and I got the impression this was more about him than about me. The location was wonderful and made me think about booking a holiday but as for improving my yoga - well........Maybe I'm being harsh and should probably give another one a chance.

IF YOU NEVER DID YOGA then this is the right video, otherwise you're better off with ANYTHING else. It isn't a workout or a yoga session, its a series of 20mn poses in which the instructor goes over the details for each pose. I guess if you ever did Brian Kest's yoga there is very little to follow up. :(",1331424000,6,416,4.346153846153846

3270196,3,B000YV1L4E,"Hey folks, don't get me wrong, I love Rodney Yee, but if you are relatively new to yoga this video is probably not for you.  I am not a raw beginner, I know a lot of poses, have attended a few classes, etc. I got this video because I have used Rodney's AM/PM Yoga for Beginners with Patricia Walden.  I only ever did the A.M. portion with Rodney as I personally find Patricia annoying.  However, the section that I did was actually a bit too easy for me.  So, I went on the hunt for something else.

This video appealed to me partly because it's for 5 days of the week, the workouts are pretty short (I like to do yoga and then something else or vice versa), I liked that it focused on part of the body each day, and it said GENTLE ENOUGH FOR BEGINNERS.  I find this to be a big fatty lie.  As other reviewers have noted, particularly for the morning, it's fairly intense.  There is no warm-up or meditation, it launches straight into the practice.  Part of the reason I do yoga is because my flexibility is terrible.  This video moves quite quickly, and while I do enjoy a challenge, I need to know modifications on poses. This video offers no modifications - except periodically to tell you you can use a strap which I usually knew already anyway.  Fortunately, I have Rodney Yee's book 'Moving Towards Balance' which shoes poses and their variations so I could pause and look stuff up.  However, had this not been the case I probably would have given up on the video.

Also, the backbend section of the video - I could easily see someone hurting themselves with this if their abdominal muscles are not strong enough to adequately support their back.

I give this 3 stars largely for just the kind of false advertising.  I just don't think it's a good choice for a lot of beginners.  I think if I was further along in my practice I would probably enjoy it.",1329264000,7,1858,4.357558139534884
3270197,3,B000YV1L4E,Rodney Yee's A.M. Yoga is a terrific DVD but after my third try at getting an unflawed DVD I'm going to settle for 4 out of 5 of the workouts.

This is perfect in so many ways. 1-5 different routines, each focusing on a different aspect; 2-20 minutes; 3-ends with relaxation and meditation; 4-Great scenery and a QUIET ease into the day; 5-BEST of all Rodney's quiet, unobtrusive, guidance that is so specific-and clear-you get the nuances one would normally only receive one-on-one in a class. Guess I need to add a 6th-RESULTS.

It is very meditative and he challenges you to think of your practice in a new way, for example, breathe into your low back.  I've been using this for over a year and I still love it.  It makes a wonderful gift.  I was trying to buy it tonight at Target for a friend but they didn't have it.  :(  It is also a great value with 5 workouts.

If you are looking for a full routine, this is not the video to choose. For me with work and time constraints, it became increasingly difficult to fit yoga.

The production values in the DVD are second to none - the music, visuals, and Rodney's voice are all captured beautifully.

The workouts themselves have a great variety.  I am no yogi, but I find them a great way to start a day that I know is going to be stressful.

I have a so much going on in my life (working full time, school part time, wedding planning, plus other misc. events) and I was looking for yoga that calmed my mind and my body that did not take forever to complete. Losing weight is the secondary benefit. I bought the A.M. yoga because there are 5 exercises on it, all focusing on different poses/exercises. All five are broken up so you can do different exercises on different days if you so choose, or all in one day. I am not very flexible (yet) but this really helps. After I do any one of these exercises I feel ready to take on the day and I can even fit this into my hectic schedule (no more than 25 minutes for any of them). The only thing I recommend is if you are new to yoga, research some of the poses first and find poses that you are able to do were you can get the most out of the workout without straining yourself. If you are looking to lose weight fast, I do not recommend this to you. Some of the poses are simple for a person who has been practicing yoga for quite sometime and is looking for a little more of a challenge. But if you are starting out, like me, and you are just looking for a little peace in your morning routine, this is something I would recommend to anybody.",1317945600,4,1339,4.134099616858237

I know GAIAM is naturally into marketing and trying to come up with new incarnations of Rodney Yee discs, but frankly I would love another disc EXACTLY like ""A.M. Yoga."" While sequels may not always work in Hollywood, I think it would work with ""A.M. Yoga."" There are MANY other Rodney Yee discs for people who want something else, but GAIAM should consider another discs of Rodney Yee himself filmed in a beautiful setting doing 20-minute vinyassa practices.",1317168000,,748,4.753846153846154

3270217,5,B000YV1L4E,"I am a serious yogi for about 20 months now. Rodney Yee DVD's are how I started my home practice and I continue to use his products and expand my yoga practice in the Iyengar method of yoga. I purchased this DVD to help develop a morning practice and have it provide variety. Every practice on the DVD is fantastic for each morning. Since practicing to this about a month ago, I have just felt better each and every day. The practices are not complex or difficult, but provide a great vehicle through which to open your body in different ways. I like how the five different practices are sequenced to start easy and then build to allow you to wake up, so to speak. Then after work I will practice to his Yoga Conditioning for Athletes or Strength Building Yoga. Great for any beginner or intermediate level yogi if you are looking for something to provide a great start to your day and/or add some different variety to your home practice.",1304208000,5,938,4.459302325581396
3270218,4,B000YV1L4E,"This DVD in essence contains five short (around 20 minute each) routines, each focusing on a different type of activity. There are standing, twists, backbends, forward, and hip openers. They are meant to be quick morning routines for the times you don't have more time for a more in depth yoga session. In addition you get an interview with Rodney Yee and the ability to change the vocal track from full to abbreviated.

The routines were fairly easy, a good way to start a day. The backgrounds in western canyons were quite lovely.

I do enjoy Rodney Yee a lot, so that was a plus.

On the downside, first, there's a forced intro discussion that you have to skip past every single time you play the DVD. That's just silly. That could have been in there as an option on the main menu if you wanted to see it. There's no reason to watch that every single time you want to do a workout.

Next, the routines don't warn you up front what you'll need for it. You're going along, enjoying the routine, and suddenly he pulls out a strap! If you weren't ready, you have to pause and run and get one. He does that with a block as well.

He doesn't mirror you - what you see on the screen is the opposite of what you yourself are doing. While that doesn't matter for the more basic poses like tree pose, when he gets into the twists that makes things quite challenging. I would much rather have seen him mirror me.

I like that at the end when he goes into ""relaxation pose"" (he won't call it Corpse Pose) that the music is quiet and then stays that way as the DVD goes around to the main menu again. With some DVDs you're laying there relaxing and then the DVD pops to energetic music which ruins the mood.

I wish he'd done a more full job of describing some poses though. Even in the ""verbose"" version he is brief in helping you get into a position and it can be challenging to figure out exactly what he is looking for. Of course the brief version of the soundtrack is even worse :) By then you better have the routines memorized.

Well recommended, but it'd be nice for them to tweak this a bit to work out some of the minor issues.",1303084800,4,2127,4.260545905707196
3270219,5,B000YV1L4E,"This has turned out to be my favorite yoga DVD--I often use it in the mornings when I don't have a lot of time before I go to work.  The routines do move fast, so sometimes I pause the DVD and hold poses a little longer or do some yin poses after these routines are over.  There are 5 different routines---standing poses, forward bends, twists ,back bends and hip openers.  The backbend one is my least favorite.  Overall, well done and routines that I will use over and over again to jump start my morning.  It might be a good idea to do a little warm up before getting started because Rodney does just jump right in and he moves pretty fast.",1301788800,,643,4.237704918032787

Ideal for an advanced beginner/intermediate practice, Yee's insightful commentaries---almost as if he knows when you're forgetting to breathe, clenching your jaw, or pushing too hard with a hand in a twist---make it seem at times like you're in a class with an attentive teacher who offers minor corrections to improve your poses and help you get more out of them. When finished, I feel simultaneously at ease and invigorated to face the day. I hope Yee is working on a Volume II, since rotating through the five ""episodes"" goes by pretty quickly, and as much as I enjoy doing them, every day now for several months, I'd be happy for the next level that pushes a bit further.

3270233,5,B000YV1L4E,"I have been practicing yoga with/without Rodnee Yee (DVDs..) for over a decade. I always love his calm, no-nonsense, organic approach to yoga. This DVD is exceptional for me in that 1) I feel wrung out of all toxins after each session, 2) the routines feel especially well structured leaving a special sense of wholeness and stability after moving through the sequenced poses Yee has choreographed, 3) the landscape of Arizona's red canyon is exquisite and nourishing for the eyes/soul/spirit during the practice, 4) the pacing and focus/grounding seems especially perfected among all his DVD practices. Each section is about 20 minutes and focuses on an entirely different pose type, yet after doing just one section your entire body feels well balanced and stabilized. Eventually, I will begin doing multiple segments at one sitting, but the idea is to work through all throughout the week so by week end each focus has been really worked. It's a great plan, transformative, should be part of preventative health programs everywhere. I mix it with Rodney Yee's Meditation DVD, which takes the bite out of urban living. I actually got up more than two hours earlier this morning to do his practice, since his intro requests you go to bed earlier and wake earlier and start each day with his practice. I'm feeling like that plan is an excellent program for long-term inner peace and productivity! Many Many Thanks, Rodney Yee!!",1296691200,3,1427,5.0
3270234,5,B000YV1L4E,"I started doing yoga watching a free Rodney Yee video on my cable company's OnDemand channel.  I stuck with it for several weeks, gradually increased my flexibility, and as long as I did it 2-3 times per week I never had back trouble.  That is really saying something, since I routinely throw out my back.  I don't know the exact reason why this works but it really does.  So after trying a live yoga class for a while, I had to go back to video since the only time I can work out is at 6am and none of the yoga studios where I live are open then.  So I bought A.M. Yoga because Rodney had been good to me and it turns out the Twists segment was the one from OnDemand -- SCORE!  I think all 5 of these roughly 20mn segments are good and I usually combine 2 in a row for a full morning workout.  One bonus feature: you can switch the audio setting to Minimum Commentary, which strips out all of the stuff about the ""sacrum"" (whatever that is), etc. and basically just tells you which pose to move to while you groove to the new age soundtrack.  Doing this makes you realize how long Rodney makes you hold each pose and helped me concentrate more.
The DVD's interview with Rodney is actually kind of funny because he talks about how his Chinese dad didn't think highly of his gymnast/ballerina/yoga instructor son's chosen profession until the son started making more money than the rest of the family.

Fortunately, I've just found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Core-Cross-Train/dp/B000YV1L44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga - Core Cross Train</a>, which addresses the missing element of ""AM Yoga for Your Week.""

AM Yoga contains five short workouts (around 25 minutes) suitable to do at home in the morning before you go to work. This is the only reliable time I have to exercise, and I simply don't have time for a 60 to 90 minute workout. Each of the five workouts focuses on one aspect of flexiblity, and each contains a secondary emphasis on strength using isometric exercises. The first is standing poses (for overall flexibility and balance), the second is forward bends (flexbility in your hamstrings and back), the third is for flexibility in the hips, the fourth is backbends to open your shoulders & upper back & chest, and the fifth is twists (looser movement).

Taken together, these five workouts are almost (oh-so-close) to being ballanced. But after doing these AM Yoga workouts most mornings for about 6-months (yes, really!), I noticed that while most of my body felt better and more flexible, my upper back still felt relatively tense and inflexible and often tense by the end of the day. Intermediate workouts (e.g., focusing on the plow or headstand) focus on the right area, but there is a large jump in flexibility from AM Yoga to a headstand.  The missing element is present in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Core-Cross-Train/dp/B000YV1L44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga - Core Cross Train</a>.

It was so hard to live with the everyday pains and aches to the point that I was beginning to believe that it was all in my head and that I am crazy. After finally discovering that I had pelvic floor muscle spasm i was at last started on the right physical therapy exercises and massage. My physical therapist recommended Rodney Yee's AM yoga. Section five of the DVD is the pelvic openers part- I just can't find the words to describe how much great help it has provided me along with my PT exercises. I could feel a huge difference with the pelvic relaxation as well as a spurt of energy that lasts with me for a few hours.

3270270,4,B000YV1L4E,"You won't find many surprises in these five 20-minute yoga sequences, just solid sequencing of bedrock poses--not a bad thing in my book. The pace of each practice is moderate, with medium length holds of poses (a possible exception is the repeated cycles within the hip opener sequence, which some may find a bit quick). Despite the short time frame and leisurely pace, each sequence manages to pack a surprisingly good selection of asanas within its particular theme: standing poses, twists, backbends, forward bends, or hip openers. The standing sequence is fairly standard, but each of the other series is more creative. Twist incorporates reclining, standing, and seated twists. The backbend sequence is dynamic and graceful. The forward bend sequence includes both standing and seated asanas. The hip opener series works repetitively and progressively. Sequences can be strung together for a longer practice, but only manually. The music is pleasant and unobtrusive, mostly wind instruments with some drums. The scenery is typical Gaiam-beautiful.

I don't notice anything especially ""A.M."" about the sequences--they can each be done at any time. If anything, all but the more fluid backbend sequence could use a warm up, so time permitting, I do a few sun salutations first, or start with backbends when linking multiple sequences. The ""full instruction"" audio track assumes some knowledge of the asanas, and consists mostly of cues for moving between postures and helpful alignment reminders within each pose. There is also a ""minimal instruction"" audio track that is nice once the sequence is familiar. Some asanas reappear in a number of sequences, allowing for increased familiarity and progress over time. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Spanish language audio track as well, well translated and cued in a pleasant voice that matched Rodney Yee's own rather nicely.

Overall, this is a decent addition to my yoga library, which I use mostly for quick fixes, lazy days, or as a stretch or cool down after a workout. I am an early intermediate yoga practitioner, but can see this being of use to most levels of practitioners, from slightly advanced beginners (those with basic familiarity of the asanas) on.

3270290,4,B000YV1L4E,"I've done a lot of Yoga DVDs over the years and I'm always looking for something new but I keep coming back to Rodney Yee. Easy to follow instruction, beautiful scenery, soothing music and a great workout. How can you go wrong?

This DVD features five all new (not re-worked from other workouts) 20-25 minute long routines. As stated in the title they are meant to be done in the ""AM"" I however did the routines at night. Usually before I went to bed as a way to unwind at the end of the day. This worked especially well because each workout has a short relaxation segment at the end.

This is also wonderful for people like myself who don't have a lot of time or struggle to get motivated for a one hour workout. Everyone can find 20 minutes somewhere in their day to join Rodney in Glen Canyon Arizona, on a beautiful sunny day for a little Yoga.

DVD includes five 20-25 minute workouts. Full or Minimal instruction (great feature)
Standing poses, Twists, Backbends, Forward Bends, Hip Openers.
A 10 minute interview with Yee.
Namaste.",1237766400,,1038,4.540106951871658
3270291,5,B000YV1L4E,"Rodney Yee has had some hits and some misses in his yoga DVDs but mostly the former, in my book. Despite the occasional DVD that did not work, I think of him as a wonderful teacher, in fact he is one of my favorites.

I don't like philosophy mixed in with physical yoga. Because of the mind+body aspect of the origins of yoga, often a new age talk track accompanies the physical yoga on DVDs. The issue with this is that every teacher of yoga has their own interpretation of the philosophy behind yoga and frequently this seems, at least to me, very different from my own readings and interpretation. So although I think yoga is holistic, I don't find yoga DVDs of physical asana practice the best medium to impart simultaneous spiritual/philosophical ideology.

One of the reasons I like Rodney Yee is that he sticks to physical yoga. His talk track is form and alignment cues. Yee usually has a minimalist instruction style that is best suited for those who have some prior experience of yoga and want a DVD to follow along but not to really ""learn"" yoga asana. Another reason I like Yee is that his yoga is ""classic"" and yet features interesting combinations.

AM Yoga for your Week is a bit of a departure from Yee's minimal talk track style. He provides extensive and wonderfully helpful cues. Despite some years of yoga practise I discovered help with some sticky points from his cues in my forward bends. Full marks to the DVD for cueing. It should work well for beginners and beyond as its audience.

Before I ordered the DVD I had read that each 20 minute session had a separate focus - twists, backbends, forward bends, standing poses, hip openers. I typically do longer sessions of yoga with a bit of everything for what I consider a balanced practise. Forward bends are effective counter poses to backbends and so on. I wondered how separating the focus would work. I find it works very well as put together by Yee. Yee sets up with prep work before getting into the deeper poses and finishes with asanas that work as effective counter poses although they are not the typical choices. Doing 20 minutes with a specific focus each day is working as well for me as doing a long session twice a week that incorporates all the categories.

This DVD is particularly useful to busy people who cross train and want to do yoga apart from other forms of exercise like strength training and cardio. The 20 minute format is easy to tag on after another workout or as an independant yoga session in the morning if you do some other stuff in the evening.

The special feature of an intervew with Yee was enjoyable. I have often worndered what attracted him to Yoga since he says so little in his other DVDs. Hearing him explain in his sincere and understated style was good. He seems to have a good sense of humor.",1237420800,5,2812,4.547430830039525
3270292,5,B000YV1L4E,"Rodney Yee is the perfect instructor. Even on video, his instructions on how to get into the poses are easy to follow. That is most important in yoga. Great video!",1236643200,,163,4.466666666666667
3270293,5,B000YV1L4E,"I do yoga regularly, with Yoga for Regular Guys being my main choice. However, some mornings, I prefer to move into the day with more relaxed moves, and this DVD is very good for that. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, this isn't really enough to stand alone as your workout, but to get your sleepy self moving in the morning, it's an excellent choice.",1233360000,,360,4.553846153846154

3270306,5,B000YV1L4E,"Rodney Yee, a veteran yoga instructor as well as the featured instructor of many yoga videos and DVDs, has recently released this new offering, AM Yoga for Your Week.  The intent was to provide five 20-minute practices (but note that the actual practice times vary from 22-26 minutes) which could be used during busy weekday mornings to get the day off to a good start.  In reality, these five excellent yoga sessions, each of which has a different focus, are appropriate for use at ANY time of the day.  Although each individual practice revolves around a specific body area/group of postures, each are well-rounded, stand-alone yoga sessions.  I have described the five practices briefly below.

STANDING, 22.5 minutes
Standing postures include standing forward bend, tree, triangle, side angle pose, warrior 1, and warrior 2; standing forward bend is performed in-between some of these poses.  The standing poses conclude with chair and wide-legged standing forward bend before moving to the floor for hero and then finishing in relaxation pose.  Yee offers some particularly nice form pointers while holding the standing poses.

TWISTS, 26 minutes
This practice opens with a series of reclined twists (one of which uses a strap).  Yee then transitions to standing with down dog and standing forward bend for revolved prayer twist and crazy dog.  Coming back to seated in cobbler's pose, he performs a twist in wide-legged seated pose and two variations on Sage 3 posture.  This practice finishes with half Lord of the fishes, cobra, and relaxation pose.

BACK BENDS, 25 minutes
Yee starts here by rolling two blankets together to create a bolster for under the upper back; he lies over this for a gentle lying backbend.  Coming to standing, he moves through a variation on sun salutations which include standing backbend, chair, down dog, warrior 2, side angle, warrior 1, and crescent lunge.  He then moves to the floor for cobra, bow, and camel.  After finishing with the backbending work, Yee nicely stretches out the body with cobbler's pose, simple seated twist, reclined leg stretch (using a strap if needed); he finished with relaxation pose.

FORWARD BENDS, 24 minutes
This practice begins in a reclined position for a series of moves that felt more like hip openers than forward bends:  reclined leg stretch (using a strap if needed), happy babies pose, and thread-the-needle.  Next Yee gradually transitions to standing through child's pose, down dog, standing forward bend, wide angle standing forward bend, and 3-legged down dog.  Coming back to the floor for seated forward bends, he performs a simple cross-legged forward bend, head-to-knee pose, full seated forward bend, cobbler's forward bend, and wide-legged forward bend, finishing with a brief rest and then relaxation pose.  To my surprise, this segment was probably my favorite, as it had a great mix of postures.

HIP OPENERS, 26 minutes
This segment uses a yoga block.  It starts with a seated opening vinyasa in which Yee flows from staff pose to cobbler's to wide-legged seated pose, gradually speeding this up and also adding half-boat pose.  He next does a simple cross-legged forward bend before incorporating the block.  Keeping one leg stretched straight out in front, he first rests the other knee on the block, then brings the knee out to the side at a right angle.  He also uses the block for cobbler's pose with the block between the feet.  Additional postures which follow include pigeon, revolved crescent lunge, double pigeon, half Lord of the fishes, wide-legged seated forward bend, and cobbler's forward bend.  The practice concludes with lightning pose, hero's pose on the block, and relaxation.

Despite Yee's long history of making yoga videos, he has still managed to offer something that feels fresh and new here.  As always, his cueing is impeccable (although mirrored cueing would be even better!), and he offers wonderful form pointers which help you to get into the postures more deeply.  Although I wouldn't recommend this DVD for those brand-new to yoga (Yee doesn't give quite that level of instruction), more experienced beginners and beyond should do fine.  In conclusion, the practices are amazing, the instructor is extremely skilled, and the scenery is breathtaking--what's not to like?  Highly recommended!",1231977600,153,4319,5.160919540229885
3270307,5,B000YV1L4E,"I've never been a fan of Rodney Yee's DVD's as I preferred more flowing type of yoga (like Shiva Rea) but I really love this one. It has 5 excellent 20-25 minute yoga practices that concentrate on different poses : standing , twists , backbends , forward bends and hip openers. every practice feels complete even though it's barely 25 minutes , each one ends with shavasana. Rodney Yee has great and detailed instruction , the scenery is beautiful and the music is good , now it's my most used DVD and it's a great as add ons to other workouts or for days you don't feel like working out but want a little stretching after a long day. Highly recommended.",1230940800,6,654,4.413223140495868
3270308,5,B000YV1L4E,Excellent video that offers a lot of helpful comments throughout the various poses. For those of us new to yoga it is a great way to learn and for those with experience I suspect it offers useful reminders about self-awareness in the poses. I've recommended it to several fellow runners looking to balance their running routines.,1229385600,,329,4.892857142857143
3270309,3,B000YV1L4E,"Well the scenery is beautiful, but I wasn't thrilled with the presentation. I thought it would be 5 mini-sessions modeled after Gaiam's ""AM & PM yoga dvd"" that I love and recommend to everyone. That DVD had a 20 minute full body session that warmed you up, had great hip openers, back bends, twists, etc and had a bit of meditation at the end. I thought this DVD would be like that one, having a warm up and a meditation for each, but focusing on different areas/stretches each day. It's not. When you start, say, the ""hip openers"" selection, Rodney Yee is already warmed up and going super fast for someone who just woke up (it is AM yoga after all, and I get up at 4:45 AM) then he slows down later but by then you are all frazzled and trying to keep up and the whole idea of starting your day with some tranquility and a nice little stretch is out the window. The stretch is there, but I am recovering from an injury so I need the warm up so that I don't re-injure myself. I guess I could do a warm up before the DVD, but I bought the DVD for this purpose so I guess I'm a little disappointed... Plus, they say it is 5 - 20 minute sessions, but they are closer to 30 minutes each, which is nice to get more than you expected, but not when you're trying to get out the door on time! I guess I'm back to the same routine from ""AM & PM yoga"" every day w/ Rodney.",1228694400,174,1362,4.048148148148148
3270310,3,B000YV1L4E,"The workout/yoga segments in this DVD are organized in a way that is very odd (and not very good).  From the Main Menu, you can choose:  Standing Poses OR  Twisting poses OR back-bends, etc.  Each segment lasts about 20 minutes.  To go from one 20-minute segment to another, you have to go back to main menu and select a different set of poses.

There is no ""combined workout"" or option to do an integrated workout/session.  There are also no segments longer than 20 minutes.  So if you want some variety and/or a longer session, this DVD will not really help you.  I found this approach to organizing the sessions to be very odd, and not conducive to a well-rounded, seamless morning workout.

If I had know this was how they did this DVD, I would not have bought it, and unfortunately, I cannot say I recommend this DVD.",1227916800,14,822,4.493243243243243
3270311,5,B000YV1L4E,"I am new to yoga. After four weeks using this DVD each day, I feel AMAZING! I look forward to it each morning, and if I miss it in the morning I hurry home from work and do it at night instead. I am buying yoga sets and this DVD for all my friends for Christmas. 20-25 minutes is just the right amount of time for me. However, I don't have much to compare it to other than some hour long BORING classes at the gym.",1227916800,,414,3.8255813953488373
3270312,4,B000YV1L4E,"I got this DVD as a gift.  At first I wasn't very excited about it.  I usually do longer yoga DVD's in the morning.  I feel guilty when I do my 35 minute routine instead of my 50 minute routine, I was concerned that the 20 minute Rodney Yee routine wouldn't be enough.  But I do yoga every morning and I also do aerobic at night.  So some mornings I am fatigued and I need to do a shorter routine.  These are perfect.  I alternate between the routines and I am always so surprised that I get the kind of work out I do in twenty minutes.  The routines are slow and Rodney Yee's voice is very soothing.  You relax yourself into these stretches and you don't even realize that you are working as hard as you are.  When you finish you can really feel the limberness and strech from the routine.

The scenery is beautiful, The voice over is soothing and easy to understand and it gives you plenty of warning before you change positions, The routines are not difficult, but they are effective.  I would reccomend this as a good addition to other routines that you already do. I would not use this as my only source of exercise.",1226275200,,1121,4.260663507109005

Yoga for Your Week"", fits the bill pefectly for me.  It gives me a good workout that's challenging enough, in an amount of time that fits my evening schedule.  I really like that each segment focuses on a different group of yoga poses--forward bends, back bends, twists, etc.  Rodney Yee's voice is soothing and his vocal guidance during a pose helps me to be sure I am getting the most out of it.

The practices are perfect for my mornings - they wake me up better than coffee and after doing them, I feel stretched, relaxed and ready to start my day. The poses are not particularly difficult, which I think is important for a morning practice when you're still quite stiff and uncoordinated, increasing the risk of injuring yourself. 5 individual programs will prevent me from getting bored.
Highly recommended!",1224028800,5,584,4.679611650485437
3270315,5,B000YV1L4E,"Normally I do this in the afternoon - perhaps a yogic faux pas? Or maybe just defiance...

My favorites are ... Hip Openers, then Twists, and once in awhile Backbends.  So I tend to do only those three and skip the Forward Bends & Standing Poses - I'm kinda lazy - plus I get enough of them when I do Yoga for Athletes (also by Rodney Yee) - I alternate between that DVD and this one but I'm looking to branch out and try another instructor too! At this point I don't have a whole lot of yoga experience but I love this DVD & would highly recommend it for toning, stretching, etc.  I always end up sweating at least a little!",1223424000,,625,4.10655737704918

His voice while soothing commands attention, and the video is shot in a beautiful location.  Once again, I actually look forward to getting up every day and doing Yoga with Rodney Yee.
Years ago, I  misplaced my  AM PM Yoga CD.  I started using misc. Instructor/Vendor Yoga CD's on hand. Some were better than others, but none were great.  Yoga became a chore, I lost interest and quit doing home Yoga altogether.
Last summer, someone mentioned Rodney YEE AM PM Yoga. My heart lept.  I remembered how I enjoyed his CD.  Rodney Yee AM Yoga is the perfect workout for me. I bought the original AM PM Yoga, and  AM YOGA for Your Week.  I look forward to doing this simple  robust workout every day.  Thank you Rodney Yee",1502236800,2,877,4.503184713375796
