This performance is one of the best you'll hear.  Considering it's from 1987, the picture and sound are quiet impressive.  Abbado (conducting without the score) and the Wiener Philharmoniker bring out all the colors of this amazing score and all the soloists all do very well with their singing and acting.  At this price, go for it!",1484524800,,473,4.802469135802469
