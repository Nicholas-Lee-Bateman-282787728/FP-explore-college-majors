8308354,3,B001HB5O2U,"I am a huge fan of the American Daredevil Icon, Evel Knievel and try to support all Evel DVD releases. However, I feel a bit ripped off by EVEL KNIEVEL'S GREATEST HITS. It is just a less than 30 minute assemblage of clips from the fantastic EVEL KNIEVEL: LAST OF THE GLADIATORS full length documentary at nearly the same price!!! I recommend passing on GREATEST HITS and highly recommend LAST OF THE GLADIATORS.",1246233600,3,411,4.6438356164383565
