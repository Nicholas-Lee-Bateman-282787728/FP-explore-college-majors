8700248,5,B00T4K0ZNE,"Love this series!  It's a laugh-out-loud series that stays fresh.  There are so many classic scenes in this series, such as when Lynda Bellingham sings ""Oklahoma"".  PLEASE release on DVD playable in the US (along with the ""Second Thought"" series)!  I would buy it in a heartbeat.",1467417600,,279,4.872340425531915
