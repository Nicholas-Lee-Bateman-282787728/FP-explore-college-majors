2154355,3,B000301YQ6,"althoug i think Manfred Manns Earth Band is a 6 star rating band i will give them only three on this concert DVD.

If you are a fan its a must to have this but the sound quality and possibly monitor problems in the beginning gives the wiever, who in this case have been to the concert when they visited norway and think they had a much better and much more recordable gig (and a much more entusiastic crowd in front of the stage)a slow start. BUT the band gives a ""stupendous"" second half and i am going to watch the DVD over and over again, reexperying the fantastic experience it is to watch a fantastic band live.

I hope they will do norway in 2006. (missing Cris Thompsons voice)",1127347200,4,684,4.253846153846154
2154356,5,B000301YQ6,"Recntly got this disc and what a pleasant surprise. Not a weak moment on the disc. As I said in my Roxy Music review, this should be required viewing for all, especially those who go in for the flavor of the minute groups. If the Outkasts or Ushers can put together a show that comes anywhere near this after being in the business over 40 years, it will be a miracle. Mick Rogers and Noel McCallas vocals are flawless, the musicianship is incredible. If ther has ever been a greater interpreter of songs that make the songs his own other than Manfred I'de like to here it. Shelter From the Storm, Castles Burning (A Neil Young song),Angelz at my Gate, Blinded by the Light, and Redemption Song, will have you mesmerized. Threst are just as good. This Moscow crowd must have felt like the luckiest people on earth to see this show.
Manfred's keyboard playing is extraorrdinary, hopefully some more performances come to light. A disc of the 2006 tour would be lovely, although anything would be welcome. I have followed all his musical incarnations since 1964, and there doesn't seem to be any looking back.
Do yourself a favour, and get this disc.",1112400000,8,1146,4.622549019607843
2154357,3,B000301YQ6,"As cool as it is finally getting to see the Earth Band perform (I've never had an opportunity to see them live here in Texas), it is quite disconcerting to watch this DVD because the video is not properly synched up with the sound.  Drumsticks in the air while you hear drum hits, mouths closed when you hear singing, etc.  Maybe this is because the DVD was produced in Russia....who knows.  Aside from that, the song selection is good and Manfred appears to be ageless (still wearing the leather hat from '73).",1108166400,4,511,4.532608695652174

8035525,2,B000301YQ6,"Question for other readers -- did your copy have an obvious sound / video match problem?  My copy seems to have a half-second mismatch on the sound track  vs. video track.

Also, the main Amazon product info says released 2005 -- but my copy (via a z-shop vendor) says copyright 2003.  It is a DVD 9 release but works on my drive.

Sounds like maybe an earlier (Russian) release of the same concert?

Just curious -- is there anyone who has both versions to see if the sound matching was corrected on the other (later) release?",1248652800,,527,4.4375

8035527,2,B000301YQ6,"If there was a way to unsync the two sides of your brain so that you can put a delay between what you see and what you hear, then this would be a great DVD. How in the world could this DVD be released when the audio is sooooo out of whack?

The last reviewer is right on when he says that there is a 1 second difference between watching a snare drum being hit and hearing it a second later. While watching this terrible sync, you try to put it back to normal with your brain, but it doesn't work. As much as this concert LOOKS good..and SOUNDS good..these two qualities TOGETHER add up to one broken DVD.",1140912000,3,604,4.07563025210084
8035528,3,B000301YQ6,"OK, first off: BIG MMEB fan. Even going back to my grade school days with ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy,"" my middle school days with ""The Mighty Quinn,"" and my college years when Manfred re-emerged as a formidable progressive rock musician, I've loved this guy all the way. While not in the same league as keyboardists like Chick Corea, Keith Emerson or Lyle Mays, the man does a great job tickling the ivories. When I ran across this DVD in the concert section at Netflix, I couldn't WAIT to see it. Now, this being just my humble opinion, for me it's a good news/bad news situation. The good news is, it's not terrible. The bad news is, it's not fantastic. That's why I'd strongly advise renting this before sinking any purchasing dollars into it.

A few other people here have mentioned the problems with the sound, and they're right...not the greatest live sound, but certainly not the worst I've ever heard. For ME, the problem was the band and the selection & execution of the songs themselves. Again, bear in mind, it wasn't a horrible performance (or I wouldn't be wasting my time bashing it here, like so many of the 1-star-reviewer nerds love to do)...it's just that there was so much MORE that could have been done with this show. Maybe this was something outside of Manfred's control, in which case, it's cool & I understand. But a few more musicians onstage would have been just the ticket for me. I think the 2 greatest albums MMEB ever did were SOLAR FIRE and THE GOOD EARTH...arguably 2 of the more memorable albums from the mid-70's heyday of classic British/European progressive rock. What I loved about those two albums was the almost Phil Spector-like ""wall of sound"" that came roaring out of my speakers when I'd play songs like ""Father of Day, Father of Night"" or especially ""Give Me the Good Earth."" These were songs that, when played at an appropriately earth-rendering volume, grabbed you by your lapels and demanded that you LISTEN UP. They were, for me, right up there with the best tracks by Floyd, Yes, ELP, King Crimson, and Peter Gabriel-era Genesis. When MMEB made the decision to do this show in Moscow, I honestly think it would have behooved them to bring along at least an extra guitarist and keyboard player...because when we're finally treated to hearing Mick sing ""Father of Day..."", it just doesn't come across with that mind-numbing WALLOP the studio version did...and listening to the 5 musicians onstage doing their best to give it justice, it seemed to me that just a little more instrumentation would have fleshed it out and REALLY knocked those Moscovites for a loop. And while I was glad for the inclusion of their version of the Boss's ""Blinded By the Light"" (which initially had to grow on me, as did their version of ""Spirit In the Night""), I really wish the show had been a little more on the 70's side and included more tracks from the 2 classic albums I mentioned earlier. (The closing track on ""The Good Earth,"" a reprise of ""Earth Hymn,"" is one of my all-time favorite prog-rock tracks...to have heard this song performed live would have been a godsend.)

But that's just me, folks. Like I said, it's not an AWFUL concert, and for MMEB completists, it's definitely worth a watch. My advice remains, though...rent it first & then make your decision about whether to buy it. You might be thankful. As for MMEB's future, I've noticed allusions to them touring in 2006...I hope this is true. If they make it out my way, I'll be first in line for a ticket.",1135641600,8,3496,4.655339805825243
