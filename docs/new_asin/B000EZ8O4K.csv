8115943,5,B000EZ8O4K,"Met Jackie when we were living in England in the late 70s. We became familiar with her book ""Chasing the Dragon"" not long afterwards, so it was a pleasant surprise to find this at Amazon.
A few years ago while visiting Hong Kong we found that her books are also available locally, comforting to know that her story is also accepted where it all happened.
We fully recommend her books.",1370044800,,384,4.5
8115944,5,B000EZ8O4K,"Jackie Pullinger's amazing story of her life's work with the drug addicts, prostitutes, and Triad gangs in Hong Kong. Amazing testimonies of Holy Spirit powered miraculous deliverance from opium and heroin addiction. Some through instantaneous deliverance, others through painless ""cold turkey"" as God set them free.

One of the most powerful DVDs you will ever watch - with first hand testimonies of this awesome work of God through one person who desired to be used by God.

8115945,5,B000EZ8O4K,"Jude writes in the New Testament that if we pray in the Holy Spirit we shall keep ourselves in the Love of God.
This story of Jackie Pullinger and her fellow believers is like the Bible being lived out as it should be.
The viewer will learn if they have ears to hear, that the key that starts the engine of God's power is speaking in the heavenly language given by the Holy Spirit.
When  miss Pullinger began doing this daily for a short time the drug addicts she was desperate to reach for Jesus began to respond to the message. People began getting born again and delivered from drug addiction by God's power.
If you are a doubter, watch it, you will be challenged.
If you are a believer, watch it it will encourage you no end!",1271203200,2,729,4.282608695652174
8115946,5,B000EZ8O4K,"Although the Walled City has now gone, this documentary is invaluable both as an historic record of one Christian woman's courage in God's hands being made a tool of His power to change lives, and an impetus to ""go thou and do likewise"". It is one thing to know about the Good Samaritan, it is quite another to be one. Watch as lives are changed and those recently redeemed grasp the idea of saving others in the same - or even more wretched - condition as they themselves once were. What an encouragement to get out of the armchair and DO something!
My only complaint about this DVD is that I wish it had been longer.......",1224460800,3,624,4.387931034482759
