8368707,5,B002F0ZYOK,"This is a fun collection for anyone who remembers early TV kids show that involved an audience of kids and a host. Often these shows were live and on a small budget, giving them a cozy sense that is missing from today's television. There's the classic Howdy Doody in 2 episodes, complete with the Peanut Gallery, which was the nickname for the audience of kids. One forgets just how crude a puppet Howdy Doody was, no effort is made to obscure the strings. Clowns were a lot more important back in the 50s. Not only is there Clarabell from Howdy Doody, but then there are clowns on The Super Circus Show, and then there is an obscure show called The Magic Clown, who frankly is kind of creepy looking but he does magic tricks with the youngsters in the audience while chronically advertising Bonomo Turkish Taffy. Heck, the kids in the audience are eating the Taffy during the show! The very rare show -Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney- also has an episode here. This was a great puppet show which had Mr Wincell, the voice of Tigger , the Banana Splits, and countless others, doing the voices for Jerry and his goofy pal Knucklehead Smiff! Also included is Diver Dan, which was more of a filmed studio product of the early 60s involving our diving hero, a mermaid, and a bunch of talking puppet fish, very cute. There's also an episode of Superman with George Reeves and some wonderful cartoons. Everything is in black and white except the cartoons. At any rate, if you're from the baby boom generation, you'll enjoy this trip down memory lane.",1246060800,9,1544,4.5978260869565215
