8637131,5,B00HXEWG1C,"I don't want to get into too much detail about the movie itself but there are bad guys galore in it with maybe 3 not so bad guys and they are the ones you pull for. I absolutely loved the acting, the humor, the story and the pace of this movie. The 2 assassins Vertabrae and Viscera are terrific. Bloody and violent and the fight scenes are great. did I mention the performances were all terrific? If you are a fan of Japanese movies...this is a must have.",1403827200,2,456,4.193181818181818
