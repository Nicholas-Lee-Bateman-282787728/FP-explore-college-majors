7990126,4,B000098ZSN,It was a fun classic. It was nice to see Johnny Weissmuller and Buster Krabbe the first two original Tarzan and both Olympic Gold Medalist in a movie together. The supporting cast was great and the story well enough. I enjoyed it and would watch it again.,1477612800,,255,4.446808510638298
7990127,2,B000098ZSN,Confused plotting.,1474848000,,18,8.5
7990128,2,B000098ZSN,"I first heard of this movie in Gabe Essoe's excellent book ""Tarzan of the Movies "".  Essoe dismissed it as ""weak in story and direction"".  After seeing it, I have agree.  Unless you are a big Johnny Weismuller  fan don't waste the money.",1473638400,,237,4.441860465116279
7990129,3,B000098ZSN,JW Tarzan fan just as well acted,1472947200,,32,3.7142857142857144
7990130,4,B000098ZSN,"The acting was surprisingly bad and the story line was pretty lame. Swamp fire was one of Weissmuller's forgettable movies. It supposedly took place in Louisiana but most of the action was on a Hollywood sound stage. Even his swimming was underwhelming. He did fight a 10 ft rubber alligator and won easily. 4 stars just for the effort and a chance to see JW again in a non-Tarzan role, although he didn't speak any better than when he was king of the apes.",1468540800,,457,4.4523809523809526
7990131,4,B000098ZSN,"Husband really liked this movie. He is a collector of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies, so this was a great surprise.  Fast shipping as well.",1367193600,,145,4.8
