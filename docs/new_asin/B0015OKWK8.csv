still has a pulse (albeit ever so slightly)!",1215561600,3,267,4.36
3146688,1,B0015OKWK8,"I have a feeling with this cast and production crew I will get lambasted - but I feel nothing but sadness and disappointment as a business owner in how this film was so miserable and not recommendable.

We have Dennis Hopper, Charlize, Nick Stahl, Woody, and AnnaSophia - arguably one of the most prolific young actresses today - in a film produced by Charlize herself! But we also have a script and overall disgust of mutual gratification (the DVD docu is filled with so many accolades about how ""everyone is God"" complex it was sickening) that no one felt they had to act.

The story revolves around a mother who abandons her child onto her brother - who in turn decide to visit the ignored patriarch of their family. In this process we see a blend of horrible filming (the continuous pan wide to close shots made it feel like a Lifetime movie), and a script that got so irritating that you felt uncomfortable watching. At 34:20 into the film the characters had become so drab that Woody's entrance as his Kingpin character felt like a breath of relief. Once Dennis Hopper was introduced - their was another feeling of hope - but that was killed immediately by the need to make him unlikeable and unbelievable. Emotional impact moments felt contrived, and when the music started feeling like a Disney channel special, I was frustrated beyond belief.

Matthew St Patrick from Six Feet Under (who was excellent in that HBO series) gave the only believable performance in this film and he is not even credited. One artistic bonus I will give this film is the scene with Anna wearing roller skates, a pink fur coat, and Paris Hilton sunglasses  dancing in swimming pool...sounds confusing but I think that is where the filmmakers were. This story was supposed to be in California - but it was snowing in Canada while they were filming so they incorporated that, which was even more confusing.

It will be a film forgotten in short order - and I hold nothing against Charlize as she is incredible. Her other production credits include an Oscar film - Monster - so I know she will continue to do great things.",1215129600,12,2105,4.647849462365591

Nick Stahl (James) is brilliant as the troubled, abused,  guilt-ridden, sad, just by his eyes, (think Carnivale) younger brother to Charlize Theron's character(Joleen).  Who is brittle, angry, bitter and just confused as to where she wants to go in life, without dragging her daughter down, played by Anna-Sophia Robb (Tara). Robb steals the movie with her hurt, and abandonment she feels but represses it. She is very cold towards her mother in the beginning. By the end of the film, the relationship that she's developed with James, she is a stronger young girl and is determined not to make the mistakes that Joleen has made.",1376784000,2,788,4.917293233082707

3146696,5,B0015OKWK8,"...and worth watching more than once. The acting is superb throughout, but the gritty performance by young AnnaSophia Robb as Tara is what carries this movie.

This is an edited version of my original review, and contains spoilers, so read no further if you haven't yet seen the film.

'Sleepwalking' opens with Tara and her ditzy, emotionally fragile mom Joleen losing the roof over their heads when Joleen's boyfriend is arrested for growing pot. Joleen's brother James (Nick Stahl) is a nice guy with a drab apartment and a dead-end job he is often late or absent to. When Joleen shows up in the middle of the night with Tara in tow he takes them in, and it is not the first such upheavel in Tara's young life.

Tara's relationship with her mom is summed up nicely in a scene that occurs their first night staying with James...Tara is being understandably sullen, and Joleen snaps ""This is not the kind of s*** I need fom you right now, Tara!"" Tara's reply is classic: ""So what kind of s*** do you need, Mom?""

One morning Joleen is gone with no explanation - save for a letter promising to return for Tara's birthday - thus leaving Tara and James to fend for themselves...Tara pleads with James to help her search for her mother, and he finally gives in, calling in sick to work...His attendance issues ultimately get James fired, and social services puts Tara in foster care...James, facing eviction himself and with Tara gone, crashes in the basement of a buddy from his old job, played by Woody Harrelson.

Tara's birthday arrives, but no Joleen...James buys her a present and takes her out, and when the time comes to return Tara to her foster home, she refuses to go back, and the two hit the road.

They stay in various motels, posing as father and daughter, and this leads to one of my favorite scenes: The one mentioned by a previous reviewer in which Tara skates around the indoor motel pool and onto the diving board...She dives in fully-dressed and skate-dances on the bottom of the pool, while two younger boys watch in astonishment. Later she and James check out, and Tara, noticing the two boys nearby, leaves her skates for them.

I will not divulge any more of what happens, as others on here have already done so...My only complaint with the ending is that James (now a fugitive) has driven himself out of Tara's life, his fate unknown, while Tara ends up back with her unreliable mother.

But then again, isn't that typical of real life?",1361145600,,2459,4.623853211009174
3146697,5,B0015OKWK8,"This movie is one of the more drama filled flicks that I have watched over the years. That being said, this movies brings different elements into each scene which makes it more interesting to watch. Annasophia Robb does a perfect job at her difficult role. Nick Stahl and Charlize Theron show true emotion into their scenes as well which definitely draws you into the film.
Overall, I thought this movie was worth the buy and had a lot of things realistically that I could relate to. If you enjoy watching movies that end in a twist and are keeping you at the edge of your seat, then I would recommend this movie.",1357344000,,613,4.482142857142857

3146699,4,B0015OKWK8,"Everyone shines in this story of a girl who understandably hates her life since she has a screwy mother, an unreliable uncle, and a hateful grandfather to deal with.  It takes a lot of trauma and one death before things finally turn around.",1343174400,,240,4.5813953488372094
3146700,4,B0015OKWK8,"intense family drama of broken people from broken homes.  If as a child you lived through the divorce of your parents, or neglect, or abuse, or abandonment, you will surely relate to the events in this movie.

really a movie about a brother and his sister and her daughter, a triangle of despair and dysfunction. They are trying to live day to day and survive.  The young daughter character is caught in the middle between an absent mother and a uncle who doesn't know a thing about parenting or taking care of someone else.

when the uncle gets fired from his job and evicted from his apartment, he and his neice hit the road to start a new life.  Soon though, cash runs low, and they are forced to go to the uncle's father's ranch for food and shelter.  There, old childhood memories re-surface. Charlize Theron is great playing a very emotionally unstable impulsive character.  Stahl is convincing as a down on his luck construction worker living from day-to-day.  Dennis Hopper's chracter is devilishly nasty and violent.

Great actors in this:  Charlize Theron, Nick Stahl, Woody Harrelson, Dennis Hopper, and young new-comer AnnaSophia Robb (who is amazing in this difficult role), as well as the always excellent Callum Keith Rennie (who is in too few scenes).

3146701,2,B0015OKWK8,Maybe not the best review because I didn't actually watch the full thing. I fell asleep and didn't even know where in the movie when I tried to watch it again the next day.,1316131200,,172,4.088235294117647
3146702,3,B0015OKWK8,"You hate to take shots at a film like ""Sleepwalking"", which was obviously a labor of love for producer Charlize Theron, who called in a lot of favors and assembled a first-rate cast and crew to make this film.  But as Yogi Berra once said: ""If you don't know where you are going, you'll probably end up someplace else"".  Apparently there was so much self-delusion going into the project that no one grasped the slow motion train wreck that this film would become after a very promising first 30 minutes.

If nothing else ""Sleepwalking"" illustrates that the constraining factor limiting the supply of ""good"" films is in the pre-production area, where producers must grasp at straws in a field of totally lame scripts in the hope that a lot of hard work in the production and post-production phases can make something out of nothing.

""Sleepwalking"" could be described as a sanitized version of Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"" (2005).  Both films are about a young person dealing with an especially traumatic childhood environment and there are a lot of production design similarities.  But ""Sleepwalking"" trades ""Tideland's"" American Gothic ""Alice in Wonderland"" quality for a somewhat muddled but very sincere and gritty redemption theme.

This effectively eliminates ""Tideland's"" off-kilter fans as likely viewers and leaves one wondering who might find the last hour of the film worthwhile viewing.  Maybe longtime fans of Joni Mtichell's ""Blue"" album could tap into it during periods of sedation. Mitchell's comments about her album fit quite nicely into a discussion of  ""Sleepwalking"":  ""The Blue album, there's hardly a dishonest note in the vocals. At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defenses there either.""

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1281312000,,2014,4.92603550295858
3146703,2,B0015OKWK8,"Big stars in this downbeat tale, but it never takes off. The depressing stuff is piled on so thick, I actually laughed: not a good sign. Charlize Theron, Woody Harrelson and Dennis Hopper just can't rescue this oddly lame picture. The 13-yr-old girl who stars has one expression: blank. Boring.",1260748800,,294,4.9
3146704,4,B0015OKWK8,"This film is a very sad and hard look at a family that has fallen apart.  With the mother gone, the uncle out of work and floundering, and the niece AWOL from the state home, you see the backgound that they came from.  They flee, only to confront themselves.

The father, a cruel brute, is seen as the key to everyone's failures.  His farm is depressing in its loneliness and cold, with hard work the only thing to do.  Instead of counsel, he decides to take advantage of their situation, which leads to consequences worse than imaginable.

It is not fun to watch, but the power of the drama and acting are undeniable.

Recommended as an excellent art indie film.",1259712000,,663,4.475
3146705,5,B0015OKWK8,"I completely dig this flick. It was emotionally exhausting but real. This is the side to life that most are lucky enough not to have to live with or see. In the days now of feel good movies and happy endings, this really cut to the chase that not every movie is given a happy ending. For the end of this movie, I wasn't real thrilled with where it ended off with either as some have so eloquently mentioned, however the meat of the story was just outstanding to me. I loved it so much I bought it. I think it's not a movie for some but for me, I found it to be exceptional.",1257897600,,573,3.991304347826087
3146706,4,B0015OKWK8,"""Sleepwalking"" starts off a bit like ""Frozen River,"" focused on a single mother struggling to make ends meet in rural America (though it was actually filmed in Saskatchewan).  But the movie quickly veers off in another direction, shifting that focus onto her 13-year-old daughter, Tara, and her younger brother, James (the girl's uncle), who are suddenly forced  to rely on one another for comfort and support when Joleen temporarily bows out of the picture.

When her boyfriend is arrested for growing marijuana, Jolene (Carlize Theron) and Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) are forced to move in with James (Nick Stahl), a soft-spoken, good-hearted fellow in his 20s who is two months behind in his rent and who barely scrapes by on what he makes at his low-paying construction job.  Soon, Joleen has split the scene, James has lost his job, and social services has taken Tara to live in a foster-care facility.  So James and Tara decide to head out onto the open highway, stopping off at roadside diners and motels, and staying one step ahead of the authorities who are in pursuit of them.

""Sleepwalking"" is one of those gritty, slice-of-life dramas that sympathetically and accurately depicts what life is like for the working poor.  It is rife with authentic details and rich in small town atmosphere.  Director William Mahr and cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchia really know how to extract the essence of a locale for mood and effect, making the bleak landscape and stark setting integral elements in the drama - an effect greatly enhanced by Christopher Young`s rich and evocative acoustic-flavored score.  Superb, naturalistic performances by the three lead actors make us truly care about the people they are portraying and the things that are happening to them.

""Sleepwalking"" is not without its flaws, however.  For one thing, the movie undercuts some of its carefully crafted verisimilitude with its casting of ""name"" actors in a few of the key secondary roles - primarily, Woody Harrelson as James' friend and work buddy, and an over-reaching Dennis Hopper as Joleen and James' abusive dad.  These parts would have been more effective had they been played by less-familiar actors (though I do realize that, without such star power attached to the project, a movie like ""Sleepwalking"" might never have gotten made in the first place).  More seriously, the otherwise excellent screenplay by Zac Stanford falls apart a bit in the final third, resorting to stereotyping and hokey melodrama when it most needs to stay true to its characters and their situations.

Still, despite the patness, ""Sleepwalking"" is a quietly powerful, richly atmospheric tale of a group of troubled but essentially decent people struggling, despite their all-too-human weaknesses, to make their way in the world.",1250985600,,2787,5.1371681415929205
3146707,4,B0015OKWK8,"I really enjoy this movie although the pace is slow. I like Tara and James very much. James is really good in the movies(although he is stupid when he is confront his dad!). It broke my heart when I saw Tara was beaten by her grandfather.
Overall the film is really good and I would rate 5 stars originally. But the scene that Tara smoke is not comfortable to me. How come the film director made the young actress(only 12 years old!) to smoke? And I don't think this scene is really important to the film. So I rate this film 4 stars only.",1250380800,,539,4.1923076923076925
3146708,5,B0015OKWK8,"Perhaps the intensity of this film was easier to take on the small screen than it was in the theater. I thought it was well acted and flowed well from beginning to end. The characters moved both geographically and developmentally which helped to keep my interest. The ending was bizare, but believable given the twisted upbringing of the brother; a mixture of good and bad. The heart is a place which is large enough to house a fearful mixture of both pure love and pure hate, and who can say which will have supremisy in the end? His journey is not over by a long shot. I can see this showing up in the future on tv. It should hit a chord with almost every age group; the struggle we all have to make sense of the world, the unfortunate situations in which we all find ourselves at times, and the emotions those situations invoke in us.",1250121600,4,837,4.337579617834395
3146709,3,B0015OKWK8,"Joleen (Charlize Theron) is a woman with a nasty mouth who seems to want to make good choices, but because she's hanging onto past hurts, she makes one bad choice after the next. It's obvious that she loves her daughter, but since she's so lost she just doesn't know how to be a good mother. Her brother James (Nick Stahl) is a sweetheart - a cool, calm, collected, good-hearted man who just can't seem to get his life together. Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) is stuck between her Mom and Uncle James. She's an unhappy little lady with no real choices.
This movie was much different than what I expected. After watching the preview, I thought James and Tara were going to escape their troubles, start over and be happy with their new lives. But what they do is go from a bad situation to one much worse. James' father (Dennis Hopper) is an evil man who cares nothing about his family. Once he was introduced I could see why Joleen was so troubled, why she was so desperate for a man's love and especially why she had that nasty mouth. I also understood why James was like a scared little boy in a man's body.
I cannot say I enjoyed this movie, but I won't say that I totally disliked it. I felt for Joleen, James and Tara, I will say that. Their story was so sad, but there was a bit of hope in the end.

3146710,4,B0015OKWK8,"Set in bleak midwinter Canada, the mood of this picture matches the impression the setting leaves with the viewer. It's a film you'll either like (no one could ever love it) or hate. There will probably few people who will find a middle ground with it. The acting is very good. Young AnnaSophia Robb is striking in the role of the abandoned girl on the run with her loser uncle, well played by Nick Stahl. All the character actors are superb, but be ready for a somber evening when you watch it. Your heart will break when the Dennis Hopper character starts slapping little AnnaSophia around. Hard to tell what the point of the film is, actually, but if you like to get your emotions stirred up, this one will do it for you. The scene where Tara (Robb) roller skates around the pool, then jumps off the diving board in her clothes and then twirls on her skates at the bottom of the pool is really bizarre, and in its strange way, unforgettable.",1239148800,,944,4.431034482758621

The instability of her home life creates a hard edge, but the love she has felt gives her heart.  Nick Stahl who was in ""Sin City"" & ""In the Bedroom"" also turns in an amazing textured performance as the brother/uncle who is called upon to care for others, even though he has trouble looking after himself.  Oscar-winner Charlize Theron (""Monster"" - 2003) produced the film.  In the DVD extras, we learn how they shot in Canada with temperatures below freezing.  As Joleen, Theron is the mother who survives on the kindness of men.  The scene where Joleen is looking at her dressy bar blouse, the only thing hanging in James' closet, shows vulnerability.  Woody Harrelson plays James' work buddy.  Dennis Hopper blows the roof off as the hard-nosed father who abuses those close to him.  This film was a labor of love, too serious for a box office blockbuster.  However, the depth and humanity of the characters made for a haunting cinematic experience.

3146713,3,B0015OKWK8,"I like this movie.  I think I would've REALLY liked it if they didn't stick with the ending that they did.

We have Tara whose mother just ups and goes away leaving her with her Uncle James.  James, while a ""good"" guy, can't seem to get his act together and ends up getting fired from his job.  James is then deemed unfit to care for Tara and she ends up in an orphange.  After staying there for a time, James takes her out for her birthday and he never returns her.  They end up taking a road trip to the farm where James and Tara's mother grew up, only to find his father to be a ruthless... well, whatever explative you want to use here.

This is where I became somewhat removed from the movie.  There is a scene where the father (played by Dennis Hopper) starts physically beating on Tara after having beat James for a bit.  James, finally standing up to his dad and standing up for himself, takes a shovel to his father, thus rescuing Tara.  I have no problem with James' decision to hit his father to prevent harm from coming to Tara, but what he did next is where I start to disconnect with the movie.

I think I would've enjoyed the movie much more if the ending had dealt with the complex emotions and decisions Tara would've been faced with of having to return to the mother who abandonded her versus wanting to stay with James who took care of her, and loved her, in a way her mother never did.

Yet another good movie spoiled by unnecessary violence and the consequences of said violence.",1229644800,,1500,4.298932384341637

3146715,5,B0015OKWK8,"There's no doubt that I'm unlike many teenage boys out there today. Rather than hitting theaters for the hottest action-packed thrillers, I seem to be drawn to indie films of this nature. Here's a storyline that you don't see very often. Not getting into a summary, the film was extremely well produced and the acting was phenomenal. The viewer understands Stahl's innocent confusion and Theron's deep insecurities. For AnnaSophia Robb, you can be assured that this is a side of her the public has not yet seen. Skeptical of how persuasive her performance would be, the young actress doesn't disappoint as she proves that she can be just as gritty and dark as she was fun, perky, and easy to love in Walt Disney's, ""Bridge to Terabithia."" The actors could not have done a better job. I laughed at every intentional corny joke and chocked up right on point. The film takes a realistic look at how screwed up life can be with just the right amount of redemption to keep you going. Be warned, however, if you're the type that needs closure and/or a happy ending, this probably isn't the film for you. Though the storyline takes on a slower pace at certain points in the film, you realize that it is necessary in ensuring that the tone is kept at an appropriate level, right where it should be. Nevertheless, you'll walk away speechless. The cinematography is incredible--the entire film appeared raw and unfiltered. Juxtaposed with a captivating score, the emotion will somehow find its way leaping off the screen and hitting you in all the right places, at the right moments. There was possibly one major song in the film (which was repeated during the end credits) that seemed to be the perfect fit. And though I know a film is never 100% perfect, I personally don't think it could get any better. ""Sleepwalking,"" is sure to wake you up--definitely a movie worth seeing.

3146717,3,B0015OKWK8,"Jolene (Charlize theron) is a horrible mother with an addictive personality and bad daddy-issues.  She seemingly loves her daughter Tara (AnnaSophia Robb), but lacks the capacity to care for her appropriately.  Instead, she's more concerned with dressing up, going out whoring, and finding the next one-night stand.  Essentially, she's an unfinanced prostitute.  When she runs on hard times, she turns to her kind-hearted brother James (Nick Stahl).  Despite his meager living conditions, he has a good heart and takes his relatives in as guests.

Unexpectedly, Jolene cowardly and irresponsibly abandons her daughter and brother with a letter and a few dollars.  The letter states that she'll soon be back, but neither her brother nor her daughter have much faith.  When they both shirk their responsibilities - Nick misses work and Tara misses school - to search for Jolene, their lack of luck leads to a change in life.

James loses his job due to his constant tardiness, and the already difficult situation with his niece becomes even more unsteady.  Soon thereafter, Tara is taken to social services, James sells all his possessions and gets evicted from his apartment, and both feel that their lives are spiraling out of control.  Luckily for James, he has a loser friend Randall (Woody Harrelson) with a basement and an air mattress.  With a shared desire to find something better, James leaves the dark basement and gets Tara - freshly rescued from social services.  At first the trip is a mystery to Tara, but she soom learns that the two are venturing towards refuge with the abusive, estranged father (Dennis Hopper) James and Jolene left behind.  Things haven't changed on their childhood farm, and the abuse continues anew.  Quite often an abused child returns with not only issues, but also a score to settle.  The drama, battle of wills, and tension boils over, as a potentially explosive relatioship comes to fruition.

In the end a strong cast is somewhat ruined by a slow pace and weak performances and a lack of resolution.  Theron is absent half of the movie, and when she is on screen she's unconvincing as a troubled, irresponsible mother.  The promise of Sleep Walking is highly unfulfilled, and it'll end up in a $5 bargain bin in the very near future.",1217116800,3,2276,4.95778364116095
3146718,3,B0015OKWK8,"New director William Maher and writer Zac Stanford previously worked together in THE CHUMSCRUBBER and the similarity of vision is apparent in SLEEPWALKING: both films deal with the empty shells of hollow people aimlessly seeking connection in a world that has become foreign territory. It is a dark, cold, brooding film that somehow manages to maintain our attention with the hope that the gloomy tunnel though which the characters are passing will have a semblance of light at the end.

Joleen (Charlize Theron) is the inadequate, loving-but-inconstant mother of twelve-year-old Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) whose reckless an aimless life leads to constant moving and lack of roots.  Evicted form her latest residence Joleen and Tara move in with Joleen's younger brother  James (Nick Stahl) whose similarly aimless life is defined by a trashy apartment and a mindless construction work job. Tara is sullen, disappointed in her mother's erratic, irresponsible behavior, and when Joleen once again takes off 'on a new idea', Tara is left with James - trying to figure out an existence for survival.  James loses his job due to absenteeism, takes up residence in the filthy basement of his nerdy co-worker Randall (Woody Harelson), while the town cop (Mathew St. Patrick) reluctantly places Tara in a foster home to await the return of Joleen. Tara prefers life with James to her 'imprisonment' and the two take off on a road trip, seeking some degree of happiness and love in a world gone berserk. When James runs out of money, he heads to his old home farm for refuge, an unlikely endpoint as his and Joleen's  childhood was warped by their abusive farmer father (Dennis Hopper).  The return to the farm, James hopes, will provide connection to Tara's past, but instead it results in a tragedy that ultimately moves Tara back to her 'home' and to Joleen, while James drives off into the unknown future, finally awakened from his sleepwalking through life.

The film is as bleak as the flat and snowy countryside (the film was shot in Canada's winter) and that countryside reflects the desperate loneliness of the characters.  The small cast offers solid portrayals with the work of Nick Stahl being the standout performance.  Theron, Robb, Harelson, Hopper, and Deborra-Lee Furness (in a small but poignant role) make the best of a shaky script.  This is a mood piece and can become depressing if the viewer expects resolution of the sad and empty lives the characters lead. But there is a haunting quality to the look of the film that stays with the viewer, especially in the mystery in the eyes of the character James as he drives into an unknown but awakened future.

3381185,1,B0015OKWK8,"I have a feeling with this cast and production crew I will get lambasted - but I feel nothing but sadness and disappointment as a business owner in how this film was so miserable and not recommendable.

We have Dennis Hopper, Charlize, Nick Stahl, Woody, and AnnaSophia - arguably one of the most prolific young actresses today - in a film produced by Charlize herself! But we also have a script and overall disgust of mutual gratification (the DVD docu is filled with so many accolades about how ""everyone is God"" complex it was sickening) that no one felt they had to act.

The story revolves around a mother who abandons her child onto her brother - who in turn decide to visit the ignored patriarch of their family. In this process we see a blend of horrible filming (the continuous pan wide to close shots made it feel like a Lifetime movie), and a script that got so irritating that you felt uncomfortable watching. At 34:20 into the film the characters had become so drab that Woody's entrance as his Kingpin character felt like a breath of relief. Once Dennis Hopper was introduced - their was another feeling of hope - but that was killed immediately by the need to make him unlikeable and unbelievable. Emotional impact moments felt contrived, and when the music started feeling like a Disney channel special, I was frustrated beyond belief.

Matthew St Patrick from Six Feet Under (who was excellent in that HBO series) gave the only believable performance in this film and he is not even credited. One artistic bonus I will give this film is the scene with Anna wearing roller skates, a pink fur coat, and Paris Hilton sunglasses  dancing in swimming pool...sounds confusing but I think that is where the filmmakers were. This story was supposed to be in California - but it was snowing in Canada while they were filming so they incorporated that, which was even more confusing.

It will be a film forgotten in short order - and I hold nothing against Charlize as she is incredible. Her other production credits include an Oscar film - Monster - so I know she will continue to do great things.",1215129600,12,2105,4.647849462365591

3381193,5,B0015OKWK8,"...and worth watching more than once. The acting is superb throughout, but the gritty performance by young AnnaSophia Robb as Tara is what carries this movie.

This is an edited version of my original review, and contains spoilers, so read no further if you haven't yet seen the film.

'Sleepwalking' opens with Tara and her ditzy, emotionally fragile mom Joleen losing the roof over their heads when Joleen's boyfriend is arrested for growing pot. Joleen's brother James (Nick Stahl) is a nice guy with a drab apartment and a dead-end job he is often late or absent to. When Joleen shows up in the middle of the night with Tara in tow he takes them in, and it is not the first such upheavel in Tara's young life.

Tara's relationship with her mom is summed up nicely in a scene that occurs their first night staying with James...Tara is being understandably sullen, and Joleen snaps ""This is not the kind of s*** I need fom you right now, Tara!"" Tara's reply is classic: ""So what kind of s*** do you need, Mom?""

One morning Joleen is gone with no explanation - save for a letter promising to return for Tara's birthday - thus leaving Tara and James to fend for themselves...Tara pleads with James to help her search for her mother, and he finally gives in, calling in sick to work...His attendance issues ultimately get James fired, and social services puts Tara in foster care...James, facing eviction himself and with Tara gone, crashes in the basement of a buddy from his old job, played by Woody Harrelson.

Tara's birthday arrives, but no Joleen...James buys her a present and takes her out, and when the time comes to return Tara to her foster home, she refuses to go back, and the two hit the road.

They stay in various motels, posing as father and daughter, and this leads to one of my favorite scenes: The one mentioned by a previous reviewer in which Tara skates around the indoor motel pool and onto the diving board...She dives in fully-dressed and skate-dances on the bottom of the pool, while two younger boys watch in astonishment. Later she and James check out, and Tara, noticing the two boys nearby, leaves her skates for them.

I will not divulge any more of what happens, as others on here have already done so...My only complaint with the ending is that James (now a fugitive) has driven himself out of Tara's life, his fate unknown, while Tara ends up back with her unreliable mother.

But then again, isn't that typical of real life?",1361145600,,2459,4.623853211009174

really a movie about a brother and his sister and her daughter, a triangle of despair and dysfunction. They are trying to live day to day and survive.  The young daughter character is caught in the middle between an absent mother and a uncle who doesn't know a thing about parenting or taking care of someone else.

when the uncle gets fired from his job and evicted from his apartment, he and his neice hit the road to start a new life.  Soon though, cash runs low, and they are forced to go to the uncle's father's ranch for food and shelter.  There, old childhood memories re-surface. Charlize Theron is great playing a very emotionally unstable impulsive character.  Stahl is convincing as a down on his luck construction worker living from day-to-day.  Dennis Hopper's chracter is devilishly nasty and violent.

Great actors in this:  Charlize Theron, Nick Stahl, Woody Harrelson, Dennis Hopper, and young new-comer AnnaSophia Robb (who is amazing in this difficult role), as well as the always excellent Callum Keith Rennie (who is in too few scenes).

3381199,3,B0015OKWK8,"You hate to take shots at a film like ""Sleepwalking"", which was obviously a labor of love for producer Charlize Theron, who called in a lot of favors and assembled a first-rate cast and crew to make this film.  But as Yogi Berra once said: ""If you don't know where you are going, you'll probably end up someplace else"".  Apparently there was so much self-delusion going into the project that no one grasped the slow motion train wreck that this film would become after a very promising first 30 minutes.

If nothing else ""Sleepwalking"" illustrates that the constraining factor limiting the supply of ""good"" films is in the pre-production area, where producers must grasp at straws in a field of totally lame scripts in the hope that a lot of hard work in the production and post-production phases can make something out of nothing.

""Sleepwalking"" could be described as a sanitized version of Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"" (2005).  Both films are about a young person dealing with an especially traumatic childhood environment and there are a lot of production design similarities.  But ""Sleepwalking"" trades ""Tideland's"" American Gothic ""Alice in Wonderland"" quality for a somewhat muddled but very sincere and gritty redemption theme.

This effectively eliminates ""Tideland's"" off-kilter fans as likely viewers and leaves one wondering who might find the last hour of the film worthwhile viewing.  Maybe longtime fans of Joni Mtichell's ""Blue"" album could tap into it during periods of sedation. Mitchell's comments about her album fit quite nicely into a discussion of  ""Sleepwalking"":  ""The Blue album, there's hardly a dishonest note in the vocals. At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defenses there either.""

The father, a cruel brute, is seen as the key to everyone's failures.  His farm is depressing in its loneliness and cold, with hard work the only thing to do.  Instead of counsel, he decides to take advantage of their situation, which leads to consequences worse than imaginable.

3381203,4,B0015OKWK8,"""Sleepwalking"" starts off a bit like ""Frozen River,"" focused on a single mother struggling to make ends meet in rural America (though it was actually filmed in Saskatchewan).  But the movie quickly veers off in another direction, shifting that focus onto her 13-year-old daughter, Tara, and her younger brother, James (the girl's uncle), who are suddenly forced  to rely on one another for comfort and support when Joleen temporarily bows out of the picture.

When her boyfriend is arrested for growing marijuana, Jolene (Carlize Theron) and Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) are forced to move in with James (Nick Stahl), a soft-spoken, good-hearted fellow in his 20s who is two months behind in his rent and who barely scrapes by on what he makes at his low-paying construction job.  Soon, Joleen has split the scene, James has lost his job, and social services has taken Tara to live in a foster-care facility.  So James and Tara decide to head out onto the open highway, stopping off at roadside diners and motels, and staying one step ahead of the authorities who are in pursuit of them.

""Sleepwalking"" is one of those gritty, slice-of-life dramas that sympathetically and accurately depicts what life is like for the working poor.  It is rife with authentic details and rich in small town atmosphere.  Director William Mahr and cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchia really know how to extract the essence of a locale for mood and effect, making the bleak landscape and stark setting integral elements in the drama - an effect greatly enhanced by Christopher Young`s rich and evocative acoustic-flavored score.  Superb, naturalistic performances by the three lead actors make us truly care about the people they are portraying and the things that are happening to them.

""Sleepwalking"" is not without its flaws, however.  For one thing, the movie undercuts some of its carefully crafted verisimilitude with its casting of ""name"" actors in a few of the key secondary roles - primarily, Woody Harrelson as James' friend and work buddy, and an over-reaching Dennis Hopper as Joleen and James' abusive dad.  These parts would have been more effective had they been played by less-familiar actors (though I do realize that, without such star power attached to the project, a movie like ""Sleepwalking"" might never have gotten made in the first place).  More seriously, the otherwise excellent screenplay by Zac Stanford falls apart a bit in the final third, resorting to stereotyping and hokey melodrama when it most needs to stay true to its characters and their situations.

Still, despite the patness, ""Sleepwalking"" is a quietly powerful, richly atmospheric tale of a group of troubled but essentially decent people struggling, despite their all-too-human weaknesses, to make their way in the world.",1250985600,,2787,5.1371681415929205

Overall the film is really good and I would rate 5 stars originally. But the scene that Tara smoke is not comfortable to me. How come the film director made the young actress(only 12 years old!) to smoke? And I don't think this scene is really important to the film.

The ending was bizare, but believable given the twisted upbringing of the brother; a mixture of good and bad. The heart is a place which is large enough to house a fearful mixture of both pure love and pure hate, and who can say which will have supremisy in the end? His journey is not over by a long shot. I can see this showing up in the future on tv. It should hit a chord with almost every age group; the struggle we all have to make sense of the world, the unfortunate situations in which we all find ourselves at times, and the emotions those situations invoke in us.",1250121600,4,837,4.337579617834395

Her brother James (Nick Stahl) is a sweetheart - a cool, calm, collected, good-hearted man who just can't seem to get his life together. Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) is stuck between her Mom and Uncle James. She's an unhappy little lady with no real choices.
This movie was much different than what I expected. After watching the preview, I thought James and Tara were going to escape their troubles, start over and be happy with their new lives. But what they do is go from a bad situation to one much worse. James' father (Dennis Hopper) is an evil man who cares nothing about his family. Once he was introduced I could see why Joleen was so troubled, why she was so desperate for a man's love and especially why she had that nasty mouth. I also understood why James was like a scared little boy in a man's body.
I cannot say I enjoyed this movie, but I won't say that I totally disliked it. I felt for Joleen, James and Tara, I will say that. Their story was so sad, but there was a bit of hope in the end.

All the character actors are superb, but be ready for a somber evening when you watch it. Your heart will break when the Dennis Hopper character starts slapping little AnnaSophia around.

We have Tara whose mother just ups and goes away leaving her with her Uncle James.  James, while a ""good"" guy, can't seem to get his act together and ends up getting fired from his job.  James is then deemed unfit to care for Tara and she ends up in an orphange.  After staying there for a time, James takes her out for her birthday and he never returns her.  They end up taking a road trip to the farm where James and Tara's mother grew up, only to find his father to be a ruthless... well, whatever explative you want to use here.

This is where I became somewhat removed from the movie.  There is a scene where the father (played by Dennis Hopper) starts physically beating on Tara after having beat James for a bit.  James, finally standing up to his dad and standing up for himself, takes a shovel to his father, thus rescuing Tara.  I have no problem with James' decision to hit his father to prevent harm from coming to Tara, but what he did next is where I start to disconnect with the movie.

I think I would've enjoyed the movie much more if the ending had dealt with the complex emotions and decisions Tara would've been faced with of having to return to the mother who abandonded her versus wanting to stay with James who took care of her, and loved her, in a way her mother never did.

Rather than hitting theaters for the hottest action-packed thrillers, I seem to be drawn to indie films of this nature. Here's a storyline that you don't see very often. Not getting into a summary, the film was extremely well produced and the acting was phenomenal. The viewer understands Stahl's innocent confusion and Theron's deep insecurities. For AnnaSophia Robb, you can be assured that this is a side of her the public has not yet seen. Skeptical of how persuasive her performance would be, the young actress doesn't disappoint as she proves that she can be just as gritty and dark as she was fun, perky, and easy to love in Walt Disney's, ""Bridge to Terabithia."" The actors could not have done a better job. I laughed at every intentional corny joke and chocked up right on point. The film takes a realistic look at how screwed up life can be with just the right amount of redemption to keep you going. Be warned, however, if you're the type that needs closure and/or a happy ending, this probably isn't the film for you. Though the storyline takes on a slower pace at certain points in the film, you realize that it is necessary in ensuring that the tone is kept at an appropriate level, right where it should be. Nevertheless, you'll walk away speechless. The cinematography is incredible--the entire film appeared raw and unfiltered. Juxtaposed with a captivating score, the emotion will somehow find its way leaping off the screen and hitting you in all the right places, at the right moments.

She seemingly loves her daughter Tara (AnnaSophia Robb), but lacks the capacity to care for her appropriately.  Instead, she's more concerned with dressing up, going out whoring, and finding the next one-night stand.  Essentially, she's an unfinanced prostitute.  When she runs on hard times, she turns to her kind-hearted brother James (Nick Stahl).  Despite his meager living conditions, he has a good heart and takes his relatives in as guests.

Unexpectedly, Jolene cowardly and irresponsibly abandons her daughter and brother with a letter and a few dollars.  The letter states that she'll soon be back, but neither her brother nor her daughter have much faith.  When they both shirk their responsibilities - Nick misses work and Tara misses school - to search for Jolene, their lack of luck leads to a change in life.

James loses his job due to his constant tardiness, and the already difficult situation with his niece becomes even more unsteady.  Soon thereafter, Tara is taken to social services, James sells all his possessions and gets evicted from his apartment, and both feel that their lives are spiraling out of control.  Luckily for James, he has a loser friend Randall (Woody Harrelson) with a basement and an air mattress.  With a shared desire to find something better, James leaves the dark basement and gets Tara - freshly rescued from social services.  At first the trip is a mystery to Tara, but she soom learns that the two are venturing towards refuge with the abusive, estranged father (Dennis Hopper) James and Jolene left behind.  Things haven't changed on their childhood farm, and the abuse continues anew.  Quite often an abused child returns with not only issues, but also a score to settle.  The drama, battle of wills, and tension boils over, as a potentially explosive relatioship comes to fruition.

In the end a strong cast is somewhat ruined by a slow pace and weak performances and a lack of resolution.  Theron is absent half of the movie, and when she is on screen she's unconvincing as a troubled, irresponsible mother.  The promise of Sleep Walking is highly unfulfilled, and it'll end up in a $5 bargain bin in the very near future.",1217116800,3,2276,4.95778364116095
3381215,3,B0015OKWK8,"New director William Maher and writer Zac Stanford previously worked together in THE CHUMSCRUBBER and the similarity of vision is apparent in SLEEPWALKING: both films deal with the empty shells of hollow people aimlessly seeking connection in a world that has become foreign territory. It is a dark, cold, brooding film that somehow manages to maintain our attention with the hope that the gloomy tunnel though which the characters are passing will have a semblance of light at the end.

Joleen (Charlize Theron) is the inadequate, loving-but-inconstant mother of twelve-year-old Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) whose reckless an aimless life leads to constant moving and lack of roots.  Evicted form her latest residence Joleen and Tara move in with Joleen's younger brother  James (Nick Stahl) whose similarly aimless life is defined by a trashy apartment and a mindless construction work job. Tara is sullen, disappointed in her mother's erratic, irresponsible behavior, and when Joleen once again takes off 'on a new idea', Tara is left with James - trying to figure out an existence for survival.  James loses his job due to absenteeism, takes up residence in the filthy basement of his nerdy co-worker Randall (Woody Harelson), while the town cop (Mathew St. Patrick) reluctantly places Tara in a foster home to await the return of Joleen. Tara prefers life with James to her 'imprisonment' and the two take off on a road trip, seeking some degree of happiness and love in a world gone berserk. When James runs out of money, he heads to his old home farm for refuge, an unlikely endpoint as his and Joleen's  childhood was warped by their abusive farmer father (Dennis Hopper).  The return to the farm, James hopes, will provide connection to Tara's past, but instead it results in a tragedy that ultimately moves Tara back to her 'home' and to Joleen, while James drives off into the unknown future, finally awakened from his sleepwalking through life.

The film is as bleak as the flat and snowy countryside (the film was shot in Canada's winter) and that countryside reflects the desperate loneliness of the characters.  The small cast offers solid portrayals with the work of Nick Stahl being the standout performance.  Theron, Robb, Harelson, Hopper, and Deborra-Lee Furness (in a small but poignant role) make the best of a shaky script.  This is a mood piece and can become depressing if the viewer expects resolution of the sad and empty lives the characters lead. But there is a haunting quality to the look of the film that stays with the viewer, especially in the mystery in the eyes of the character James as he drives into an unknown but awakened future.
