8616342,3,B00FKGSEV6,"Isabel (Jemma Dallender) and her cameraman Will (Elliot Jordan) head off to a remote apartment complex called ""The Estate"", ""Project"" or ""Community."" They take the bus. They are to meet Mr. Lowman (Ellis Day) only to find out he had died. Instead they film an eerie group of kids eager to show them stuff, like dead animals.

The film draws you in during the first 30 minutes or so. What is going on? Who are those guys watching in the car? What about the weed? What happens at night? Then there is the older kid on a bicycle looking like he came right out of ""Better off Dead.""

Once we start to get past the mystery, the film goes downhill and at an hour into the feature it has gone from stellar to run of the mill. I loved the creepy kids and the Berryman looking guy, but it needed something more.
