8538958,3,B009AZSULW,"This Blu-Ray is like some of my former girlfriends:  hours of teasing with the eventual realization that teasing is all you are going to get.  There is great potential here with modern aircraft, skilled and knowledgeable flight crews, and great African scenery, but none of it is used to its potential.

Ethiopian has an interesting fleet with two 737 types, 757, 767, 777, 787, MD11 and three types of propeller aircraft, but all we get here is the 737-700 and -800, and the Q-400.

Lots of too long briefings that don't really add to anything except the length of the disc.  No significant views of the African terrain, especially as we encounter interesting weather conditions around Kilimanjaro.  Many of the cockpit views are filmed such that the reflections from the cockpit interfere with our visuals, particularly when they try to show us the in house Ethiopian Air software on their laptops, it's basically unreadable.

Just Planes also tries the trick they used before of putting two views, external and cockpit, on the screen at the same time, which I find unwatchable.  When they are not doing that, they are switching back and forth between views so quickly that you are teased into unhappiness.

A Blu-Ray of great unrealized potential.  I bet that we could make two better videos out of the video they filmed and didn't use than they did out of the one video they did make.  In other words, Just Planes continues on their path of trying to figure out how to make a good Blu-Ray (they knew how to make a good 1.5 to 2 hour DVD, but 3:40 on a Blu-Ray is harder to do right).  This is not one of their better efforts.",1355184000,2,1629,4.618055555555555
