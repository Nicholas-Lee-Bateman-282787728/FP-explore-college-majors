8378418,5,B002R6IIZO,"This is a truly great, riveting documentary that explores the lives and plight of polar bears vis a vis climate change/global warming(in this case, the melting of the polar ice cap). It is clearly a labor of love and utmost concern, and the footage is phenomenal. The setting is Wrangel Island, a large polar bear breeding ground in the Arctic. It is amazing and humbling that the 2 explorers/scientists/cinematographers were able to get so close to the many wild bears that ventured into their geographical area where their research shack and grounds are located. Watch them fend off some of the more curious adult bears that they encounter with nothing more than a hearty shout, a large stick, and their dog! They also encounter an orphaned cub, who struggles to survive since it's mother was killed. The hungry cub often walks right up to the men and wants to stay close to them as well, for food and comfort! Just amazing!",1294358400,10,926,4.75776397515528
