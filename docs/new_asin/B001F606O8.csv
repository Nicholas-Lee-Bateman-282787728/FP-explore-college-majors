8301068,4,B001F606O8,"The film transfers are good and I was happy with the selection of films. My only dissappointment was that the color film ""To The Fair"" (1965) is in black and white on this DVD.",1262217600,4,176,4.205882352941177
8301069,5,B001F606O8,"I remember seeing the 1964 NY World's Fair as a kid. Back then it seemed like nothing was impossible and we really were heading for a future that looked a lot like the Jetsons. This was totally reinforced by the Fair, with it's sleek buildings, it's various visions of tomorrow, many of which can be seen in this collection of films. Also amazing are the films of Coney Island's adventure parks, which is nothing like today. I guess the future isn't what it was, but what a lovely bunch of memories...",1245024000,4,501,4.516483516483516
8301070,5,B001F606O8,"This is a wonderful collection. It is an important record of the way America played, and the way America envisioned tomorrow. It's amazing that the NY world's fair only lasted 2 years, the effort to create it is astounding. Then there's Coney Island, a wonder in it's time. I remember these things fondly. It will amaze those who have never seen these wonders as well. Disney's Epcot owes much to the 1964 NY World's Fair.",1232409600,7,422,4.64
