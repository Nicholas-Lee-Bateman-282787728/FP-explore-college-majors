8357719,1,B0029DG032,"I rented this DVD on Netflix and it is wonderful.  However, the product sent to me was a CD soundtrack, not a DVD.  I have a multisystem DVD and TV that handles U.S. and European specs.  I sent the product back to mailer with request to have my money returned.  There is no sign of that having happened.
