8554884,5,B00ANSYRAS,"This is the prefect film for me since I love to visit New York City as a tourist and I have been studying French for years. What could be better than a French film about French tourists in New York City? Half of the dialog is in English and there are English subtitles so you will have no problem understanding the action. New York City is shown in all this glory in this movie. There are even some scenes in Brooklyn.

The soundtrack is also great and includes a cover version of Rod Stewart's ""Young Turks"".",1380844800,,509,4.302083333333333
