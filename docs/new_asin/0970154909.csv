7794157,3,0970154909,"We found the low energy and tense presentation in the beginning to be off-putting. The general overview and history sections felt unhelpful. The camera angles and switches from close to distant in annoying ways. Nonetheless, once the discussion of each individual type began, we felt more engaged and interested. We would use this second half to give students an interesting and useful overview of the nine types.",1268697600,2,413,5.17910447761194

7794159,5,0970154909,"Easy to understand, professionally presented, and illustrating what  affects our actions and behavior, this reviewer found the Enneagram on  video to be a new, powerful tool for self-discovery and psychological  transformation. A nine-pointed star within a circle is a practical model  for uniting ancient wisdom of the soul with proven scientific  principles.
Applying these teachings in our everyday affairs will provide  a high-powered impact on communications with others resulting in better  relationships with family, friends, and in the workplace.
The Enneagram  symbol begins with an ancient concept of an empty circle symbolizing soul,  spirit, and the manifestation potential. Points of an equilateral triangle  wilthin a circle represent the trinity of our feeling, thinking, and  instinctive centers. Inclusion of a hexagram with a triangle provides  currents or paths to correspondences for the development or regression of  each of nine personality types.
""Discover Yourself with the  Enneagram...a Beginners Guide"" is eighty-four minutes of exciting,  useful knowledge for self-transformation, personal freedom, better  communications and relationships, and is highly recommended.
