8676004,3,B00N3BYOOG,"I received this as a gift for Christmas. This is a five DVD set that comes packaged in a box (front cover has the shown picture) which has a DVD case with double sided disc sleeves inside holding the discs. One of these sleeves was purple instead of the normal white/clear and while the others attach to a hook inside the box, this one is free floating and falls out if I'm not careful opening the DVD case. The box itself is as shown but this is a cardboard box which covers the actual DVD case. The DVD case is completely white with no distinguishing features. In other words, if you want to just keep the DVD case on the shelf you will have no idea what is in it. You will have to keep the box and remove and replace it when you watch.
All of the DVDs played properly in my North American DVD player and the quality of the video on my 32"" flatscreen was good. When played on my TV there was a black box all around the outside of the picture making it smaller than my actual TV screen. It wasn't really a bother but it was there and there was no option on the DVD to change aspect ratios, though I suspect I could have done so by messing with my TV menu if it had really bothered me.
The DVDs are all set up for Chinese viewing. You will have to change the language and subtitles with every disc to Korean and English respectively. The opening title sequence which shows the credits with actors names and several scenes from the show has no music when played in the Korean version while the Chinese does, though it is quiet. Also, one of my favourite scenes with Cheon Song Yi singing to Bruno Mars' ""Marry You"" was changed to her dancing to the drama's own song ""My Love From The Star"" by Younha. Not the same message... I wonder if it was a copyright issue.
The subtitles were generally good. Some typos were noted throughout. There are some places where the subtitles do not keep up with the character's speech and it is clear some text is missing. This is especially noticeable in one of the later car scenes with Cheon Song Yi and Lee Hee Kyung. It also seems some text has been simplified or left out to keep the subtitles cleaner, simpler and slower as many characters will talk for long periods of time with only one sentenced subtitled. There was use of minor swear words in this translation which I was not thrilled with. I understand that there are swearing equivalents but would much prefer the translation ""son of a dog"" which is the literal translation to an equivalent level English swear word. The one instance of a major swear word had the first two letters of the word with dashes marking the un-shown letters and the suffix following. The use of some words during translation also made me feel like Cheon Song Yi got smarter near the end of the DVD because her subtitled vocabulary became much broader and significantly less crass, though this could be due to her hating less and loving more. I understand there is difficulty in matching tone while balancing accuracy in translation but this was noticeable for me.
There are no special features on any of the discs and the extra ending of the drama with the house and the swing are not included in this version. In fact there are no options at all besides the language and subtitle choice. The chapters in each DVD consist only of each episode so if you need to get to the middle of episode 5 you can quickly skip to this episode but will then have to fast forward to the spot you want.
Overall, I am moderately happy with this DVD. I love this show and cannot say enough about it. It is worth it to me just to own a copy in case my streaming sites remove it. My grade above is a reflection on the DVD itself rather than the show, which I would give 5 stars. If you are considering buying this, it is a basic version of this very excellent show and most people who are not perfectionists will probably be happy with it.",1451692800,,3890,4.322845417236662
8676005,5,B00N3BYOOG,"This television  show which is 21 episode  long, is a beautifully  acted both leads won major awards for acting . This show broke records for it popularity  all over Asia but is Korean filmed and made. Kim Soo Hyun is wonderful as a 400 year Alien  that is trapped on earth after missing his ship home.  He spend these 400 years working and waiting for a chance to get back home, he lives on earth but he doesn't  connect fully with anyone after a early tragedy. Then as earth and his star are again in line to allow him to return to his world after 400 year he has only 3 month left he meets a beautiful actress that moves next door to him. This a love story with a twist it exceptional  from beginning to end.",1438387200,3,711,4.138686131386861
8676006,5,B00N3BYOOG,"One of the best K-dramas I've ever watched, and I've watched plenty.  I recommend this wonderful story to anyone!",1416614400,3,113,4.947368421052632
8676007,5,B00N3BYOOG,"This was a complete waste of money (lots of money at that). My Love From the Stars is probably my favorite K-drama so I basically wanted to buy a trophy that I could also lend out to let people watch if they were interested, but this case is a joke. I wouldn't lend this out to anybody. Honestly, I'm probably going to get a refund or just throw it away. This set is a cheap cardboard box you have to physically pull apart at the top to get to the cheaper plain white case, that appears to be in no way related to this show or DVDs in general, only to open to see the discs in cheap mismatched general soft DVD/CD covers that are partially secured inside. I'm really thinking this may be a scam and actually wonder if I should report this. It's extremely hard to believe that the Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) would want to be associated in any way to a product this cheap and poorly put together. The show itself is amazing. Definitely watch it if you're at all interested. You can watch it for free (with ads though) on dramafever.com / viki.com / hulu.com / and probably youtube.com .

Update - I don't think this particular product was a scam. It was my misunderstanding on my side. Also Amazon and the seller where both great to work with. I still wouldn't buy this version. It's a pathetically cheap product for an extremely high price. It's really tough to see the difference between versions (no help from the pictures or descriptions unfortunately), but it looks like there is this version and a nicer deluxe version.",1410912000,4,1528,4.457142857142857
