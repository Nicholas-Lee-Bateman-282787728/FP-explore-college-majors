8245970,4,B0012GVKYG,Product (DVD) arrived early and in great condition. Have not actually viewed either of these movies yet so a review by me at this point would be entirely inaccurate. Product was packaged very well and not difficult at all to get open.,1397865600,,234,4.595238095238095
8245971,3,B0012GVKYG,"Randal Malone's character gets axed (yeah, I went there) in the first movie but returns as a ghost to haunt the Lizzie Borden-possessed chick with an axe to grind. Formulative and tired script still manages to entertain due to crisp camerawork and keeping most of the action in and around the stylish setpiece of a house that has appeared in at least ten of Sterling Pictures's movies; the plot is simple, crazy girl (possessed by Lizzie Borden) murders her doc, escapes the nuthouse and goes back to college to lure stupid pretty people to their deaths...standard slasher fare and worth at least one look. Lots of blood and a large dose of ham.",1349568000,,645,4.716814159292035
