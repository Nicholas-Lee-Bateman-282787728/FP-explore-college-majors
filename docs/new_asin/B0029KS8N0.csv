8357855,5,B0029KS8N0,"A beautiful film, ""Casque d'Or"" refuses to be cataloged as a tale at the edge of melodrama and opts for tragedy in a poetic tone rarely expressed with so much visual and verbal economy. The story is set during the ""belle poque,"" between prostitutes and ""Apaches"" (name given to marginal Parisians in late 19th century and early 20th century), based on a real case occurred in 1902, a love triangle between a streetwalker and two ruffians, played by a radiant Simone Signoret as the prostitute Marie (nicknamed ""Casque d'Or"" for her blonde mane), Serge Reggiani as the carpenter she falls in love with, and Claude Dauphin as a ruthless ruler of pimps and wine dealer. The story evolves with violent effusions and moments of intense lyricism, expressed through beautiful black & white images and characterizations where gestures and glances shine with precision - especially Simone Signoret's eyes, as when she says goodbye to her future lover in a ballroom next to the river. Jacques Becker turned it into a masterpiece, so by the late 1950s he was not targeted by the attacks of the ""nouvelle vague"" rebels (Chabrol, Truffaut, Godard et al). It is good to remember that these young men, although they made good films, quite often made unfair judgments of the cinema of old masters, as Carn, Clouzot or Duvivier... because they wanted to make cinema and the industry did not give them entrance. I do not know if Carn, Clouzot or Duvivier, who made ""cinma de papa"" (pejorative term coined by Truffaut) had any fault, but some of the films that were rejected are far from being despicable productions. In any case, Becker did two more great works, ""Hands Off the Loot"" in 1954 with Jean Gabin and Dora Doll, and in 1960 his last film, ""The Hole"" (Le trou), a classic drama about a jailbreak. ""Casque d'Or"" is absolutely recommended.",1487462400,,1829,4.828025477707007
8357856,5,B0029KS8N0,"Wonderfully filmed and acted story of tragic love amidst the French underworld at the turn of the 20th century.

The complex, layered relationships, and subtle manipulations and interplay between the characters show the hallmark of all Jacques Becker's work, an interest in the subtle details of human behavior and emotion, instead of grand, sweeping, complex plots.

Both romantic and cynical, and filmed without any attempt to create a clich 'period' look, this brings an air of reality and immediacy to a story that in other hands seem familiar, maudlin, or trite.

While the Criterion was an excellent DVD transfer when released (2005), and can usually be had used for a reasonable price, the new UK blu-ray is a notable step up in picture quality, IF you can play a region B locked disc.",1324684800,,792,4.93984962406015
