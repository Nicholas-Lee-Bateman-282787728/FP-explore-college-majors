8145024,3,B000ICM5TE,"1st off I love Mystic force..but what I don't like is how they skiped so many good episodes!

I got this dvd with vol#3 as well and was shocked at how crappy there treating the dvd relase of this great show.

2nd off the dvd menu is the same one they used the past 2 times..with the same music and everything...the same layout....and its just getting old.

I could live with that but when I played the episodes I was madder than any bad guy on this show! They skiped the episode where madison gets turned to stone,and the 2-parter ""Stanger within"" where Vieda becomes a vampire!(WHY!?) And vol#3's order makes no sence at all..Daggeron just pops out of nowhere on the Bonus episode... and I'm sure there is more skiped episodes I just cant think of them at the moment.

I hope the next volume has the episodes that they skiped.(Maybe they want vol. 4 to be about the Blue and Pink rangers and make a vol. just for them.) Thats fine with me, But I would have like to seen all the episodes in order.",1164931200,6,997,4.315508021390374
8145025,3,B000ICM5TE,"this DVD is a whirlind of action, lessons, and new ranger weapons. In the first episode  Rock solid  Nick is responsible for Madison's turning to stone. However their making up unlocks the brand new titan Megazord! In  Whispering Voices  Koragg summons Red Ranger for a showdown on the beach. however the battle leads to Koragg's capture of the Megazord's combining power! And in  Legendary Catastros  Nick is trapped in a dark dimension with Koragg's Zord-like horse. However Nick ends up combining with him to become the  Centaurus Pheonix Megazord  only to lose him and regain the Titan Megazord combining power. I recommend this DVD to anyone starting power rangers fan",1158451200,2,673,5.054545454545455
