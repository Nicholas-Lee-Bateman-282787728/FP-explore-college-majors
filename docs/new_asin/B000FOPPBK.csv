2578362,5,B000FOPPBK,Item arrived in a speedy manner.  Excellant condition.  Would order form seller again.,1267142400,,86,5.538461538461538
2578363,1,B000FOPPBK,Simply put this is not a good release to get.  Over the top plays fine but Demolition Man is defective and only has a version that plays with the audio director commentary always on with no option to turn it off.  It's too bad it was manufactured with this defect.  So if a different release of Demolition Man is avaliable go buy it because this commentary only version is very annoying poorly made disfunctioning dvd with a messed up menu layout.,1230681600,,447,4.493827160493828
2578364,5,B000FOPPBK,"I love Over the top, a oldie but goodie.",1181692800,,40,3.5555555555555554
2578365,4,B000FOPPBK,"Ignore the other review about some guy talking over the movie. This film has a commentary track in addition to the movie soundtrack & the guy didn't know how to turn off the 2nd track.

Demolition Man is great. Haven't seen Over The Top yet but I'm sure I'll enjoy it. Oh & this is a flipper disc with one movie per side of the disc.",1179446400,11,333,4.045454545454546
2578366,1,B000FOPPBK,"Demolition Man was bad. It wasn't like the movie should be. You had someone explaining everything through the whole movie and could not hear the actors. That ruined the movie. I wanted the movie to replace my old VHS, but I can't now with that crap I bought.",1162598400,3,258,4.395833333333333
2578377,5,B000FOPPBK,Two great movies. Demolition Man is incredible and Over the Top is even better. This is the best four dollars I ever spent.,1370908800,,123,4.391304347826087
2578378,4,B000FOPPBK,Good action pack. I bought this movie to get Over the Top. Demolition Man was a good bonus. Over the Top deals about Father and Son relationships. It reminds me of my childhood. Demolition man is a futuristic movie. If you have read the book 1984 this movie reminds me of it.,1367539200,,275,4.3076923076923075
2578379,4,B000FOPPBK,"One of the bargain DVDs I picked up last week was an ""Action Double Feature"" with two  Sylvester Stallone movies: ""Demolition Man"" and ""Over The Top."" Well, I haven't seen a Sylvester Stallone movie in over three decades. I quit going to them because of the poor acting, but I went back here for another try because I perceived the DVD to be a bargain at five bucks. It was worth while. The acting was still bad, but it was bad in a funny sort of way. Maybe I'm mellowing.

In ""Demolition Man"" we view a futuristic Southern California city called San Angeles which includes everything  from Santa Barbara through San Diego. There's a lot of funny things in it like automatic graffiti-making equipment. It's funny. Also, the inhabitants are ticketed for using foul language and Stallone picks up quit a bundle of tickets. The so-called Demolition Man lives up to his name, that's for certain. In general, the humor is sophomoric, but I got a few good chuckles.

""Over the Top is the better movie, in my opinion. It still has poor acting, but carries a sort of rolling humor with it that makes you chuckle with the scenes. For a really funny episode, linger over the Neanderthals participating in the World  Championship of Arm Wrestling. I've never witnessed such a collection of knuckle walkers in the same room. In any case, this movie had less death and destruction and was a touching little story, involving a small boy, that any father will probably appreciate. Little boys will like it too. I'd say this one is much more ""family friendly"" if that's of any concern.

This is a worthwhile double-feature DVD. It's not deep, but it's fun entertainment. I'd give it a good four stars. Enjoy the viewing.

2578384,1,B000FOPPBK,"well I love all of Stallone's movies, would have loved Demolition man but it had commentary throughout the entire thing! U can't watch and listen to a movie with that crap in your way! Over the top played fine however! great movie! one star for demolition man not being able to hear and watch!",1287446400,,293,4.444444444444445
2578385,5,B000FOPPBK,"Today is September 9th, 2010. I recieved this two pack in the mail today. I mainly bought it for ""Over the Top"" but ""Demolition Man"" was a nice bonus. I had read from other reviews on here that there is audio commentary from the director that you can't get to cut off on ""Demolition Man"". I decided to buy it anyway and see if I could figure it out. I figured even if I didn't eh, it was still cheaper to get ""Over the Top"" in this pack then by itself. Well, if you're having issues with it don't worry. Don't bother with the special features menu. You can't get it off there. All you need to do is just start the movie and hit the ""audio"" button on your dvd remote control. That's it!! Works perfectly for me now. Leave a message here if it worked for you as well!",1283990400,,765,4.072847682119205
