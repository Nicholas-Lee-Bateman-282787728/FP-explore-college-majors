1379869,5,B00004Z30F,"JUST FANTASTIC , A GREAT DVD A must for all drummers",1021593600,2,52,3.8181818181818183
1379870,5,B00004Z30F,"Let's face it, people buy this video because Colaiuta's on it. Jimbo does some cool ostenato stuff, playing a rhumba clave with his left foot and soloing over it, but his drums sound horrible.  Billy Ward sounds good, but he doesn't do enough playing.  He does a really cool thing where he plays with just his hands (without sticks), but only does it for about thirty seconds.

Now we come to Vinnie.  What can you say?  The guy's the best drummer in the world.  A buddy of mine thinks he's not really ""on"" in this video, but he's still absolutely amazing.  Vinnie on a bad day is still awesome.  He and his band play for over twenty minutes and, considering the lack of footage of him, it's well worth it.  If Vinnie comes out with an instructional video, it will top the charts.",1014076800,3,780,4.398601398601398
1379871,5,B00004Z30F,"this video was well produced...an excellent group of in dividuals put together for some great performances...highlights are Akira Jimbo and his fusion of electronic and acoustic drum elements. He really seemed to be having a great time back there!  Billy ward, who i have never seen or heard, really had some great conceptual ideas and groove theory based on feel.  Hilary Jones played some nice pieces topped by an impressive solo.  She showed an ability to build a piece with nuance and strength.  What can i possibly say about Vinnie...any footage of vinnie on tape is welcomed in my opinion....there isn't enough of it...he plays 3 selections with Karizma..and goes into some explanation of his ideas.  This seems tough for him, I mean trying to explain his concepts to us mere mortals is a task to big even for him. Among his peers vinnie still shows that he is the man...! well done hudson music!  also thanks amazon for getting me my tape so quickly........",970531200,7,964,4.8121212121212125

7928001,4,B00004Z30F,"I bought this for the Yellow Matter Custard section as history-wise, this was (MD2000) the very first concert Neal Morse played after leaving his band, ""Spock's Beard"". I'm sure it contains excellent drumming sections but since I'm not a drummer I can't comment on that but this really is good value for money and contains good footage!.",1406246400,,337,4.9298245614035086

7928004,5,B00004Z30F,"This by far is one of the best drumming dvd's I have ever seen!  There is some of the best preforming artist's in the world of drumming today on these dvd's.  The Hip Pickles was a great suprise to see on the discs.  Drum line playing is one of my favorite styles of playing.  I would recomend these discs to any one who loves playing, watching, and listening to the art of drumm playing

7928005,2,B00004Z30F,"first thing is, this DVD is based on the VHS version of the same festival, so the sound/visual quality is just fine,

and about the performance, i don't think that's as good as other MD Fest, drummers on the show are all great drummers, i know, Vinnie, Horacio, Paul, they are all great on their own, and Dave is so good with Slayer, but when he come to soloing, that's a different story, and for Don, well....  he's a legend, but how he is related to a ""best-drummers-on-the-planet"" show, i can't understand, and i'l like to see Akira playing with Casiopeia other than his electronic toys, he's play so much better in a band......",1100304000,3,631,4.526315789473684
7928006,4,B00004Z30F,"The first thing I noticed was the big differences between the quality of drummers. I define quality by, creativity, technique and speed. Some drummers on this video doesn't have the creativity and speed and some are not as technical. Funny to see was that they edited the video in a way that you can see ""Don Brewer"" first, whom is constantly covering himself by saying that he isn't a technical drummer (Well he lacks everything) and after Don Brewer comes Horacio ""El Negro"" Hernandez. The contrast between these two is so very big, that you can really laugh about good old Don, with all respect (but man, what the hell are you doing in a famous festival, go back to you garage).
I really like Akiro Jimbo on this DVD, he's a very technical drummer and I can listen to him for hours, because he's also a very creative drummer. He's combining electrical drums with acoustic, which gives a good show. Vinnie Colaiuta is a perfect drummer, though a bit ""overmature"" with all respect. The music they make on this DVD is very complicated, but very good!
The DVD is of good quality, both video and sound, though it's too bad it isn't 16:9 or widescreen. And I miss ""Dave weckl"" and ""Dennis Chambers""! Though it was nice to see other drummers who I didn't know, who are quite good. Hilary Jones is also pretty good, I like female drummers..  somehow they are very attractive :)",1050537600,4,1372,4.5772357723577235
7928007,5,B00004Z30F,"Before I viewed the DVD I knew the participants would be terrific, but I wasn't really expecting much from the production of the video. As it turns out I was wrong about the production and pleasantly surprised by how well produced this video is.  The sound and picture quality are both suberb and it features revealing camera angles and thoughtful editing.
For those of us who could not attend the festival, it is a great way to see what you missed.  For those who did attend it's good way to recall a great show.  My only complaint is that they don't appear to be producing a video for any of the other MD festivals.  Too bad for all of us who can't see these in person.",1036022400,,671,4.301587301587301
