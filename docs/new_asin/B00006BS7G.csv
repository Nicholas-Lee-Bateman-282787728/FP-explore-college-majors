7966815,1,B00006BS7G,"I got this movie a few years ago because I collect Joe Lara movies. He was best in Gunsmoke Last Apache and American Cyborg. Star Fire Mutiny was a complete bomb. It was utter space junk.

I had to watch this movie several times to get the point and to be honest, I never really quite got it other than the usual psycho wanting something. There was wooden acting, no recognizable script, and Joe was mercifully 'unconscous' during most of it. Now that really rubbed me the wrong way. Joe looks so tough but he got knocked out for the most of the film so there was no point because I got it to see him. I also wasn't too thrilled seeing him for a second movie with short hair.  Joe looks his best in his trademark long hair and thank goodness since this movie was made he's grown his hair back.

The end intrigued me where Joe has that blond as his wife and a kid on that planet that they're starting over on. Gee, really wish Joe would get married and have kids. They would be so good looking.",1302307200,,993,4.18848167539267
7966816,2,B00006BS7G,"All the people on Earth are in cryogenic suspension in a big spaceship orbiting the planet (the atmosphere is screwed up or something), except for some prison convicts who are still on the planet's surface.  Some of them get free and make their way to the cryo-ship, where they start blowing things up.  This seemed like it wanted to be a steamy T&A movie like some of Simandl's other stuff, but all we get is a couple of blink-and-you'll-miss-it topless shots.  Without a load of nudity, there's really no reason to see this.  The plot is ridiculous, the acting is poor, the comic relief characters made me groan, and there's just nothing of interest going on.  Oh, people run around and do stuff, I just didn't care if they lived or died really.  The ending is just plain bonkers.  Special effects are slightly better than I'd expect from a low budget Czechoslovakian sci-fi film.  The characters were likable enough I suppose, but the plot couldn't really be taken seriously enough to actually feel for them.

Overall, skip it.",1153353600,4,1030,4.741573033707865
