8340586,5,B001T471HQ,"This program was better than I expected. I was glued to my seat for the entire 4 hours. The re-enactments and interviews almost put you right there in Tehran in 1979 & 1980. The program that I thought was the most interesting of all was the episode about the rescue mission. This episode alone is worth the entire amount. The vintage footage was also very good along with the commentaries from the author, hostages, hostage takers, and military members.",1250208000,,453,4.746835443037975
