7901026,5,8372009880,"This is Visconti's last movie and, in my opinion, the best.  It is simply unforgettable.  The relationship between the husband and wife in the movie is complex and finely nuanced.  The wife, at least intitally, seems to be the victim of an insensitive and almost cruel husband. In the end, when he learns that she also had a lover, we may think that he got his comeuppance, but it is not as simple as that. One can never tell for sure if the wife re-embraces the husband for the sake of the child, or because she never stopped loving him.  When the tragedy struck, perhaps she did not know either.  But that's how human relationships can be.  The acting is simply superb.  Laura Antonelli is exquisite.",1188950400,3,702,4.523809523809524
