8025352,1,B0002B54Y4,Very unsatisfied. Copy was poor. I have older movies in my collection that were of far better quality that came out during the same year. Rating copy of movie one star.,1447286400,,168,4.451612903225806

8025354,2,B0002B54Y4,The movie would be worth 3 or 4 stars but the version that Amazon has is pan and scan and looks like it was transfered from an ep speed vhs tape. I wish Amazon would do a better job of quality control on the martial arts films available on prime.,1385769600,2,246,3.94
8025355,1,B0002B54Y4,"I purchased this dvd only to be disappointed to find out
that it is not the original Street Gangs of Hong Kong movie.
What is inside is a movie called, ""Street Gangs of Hong Kong: The Delinquent.
Some of the original cast members are in it, but it is not the movie
that you want to see. Although the movie poster is authentic, you will be
disappointed.",1355961600,3,352,4.268656716417911
8025356,1,B0002B54Y4,When I went online to purchase this movie.  The title was right as well the description and who was starring in this movie.  But when I received the martial art movie it had the right title but the wrong actors.,1326067200,4,211,4.25
8025357,1,B0002B54Y4,Dont be fooled by the title.  This is a complete rip off.  Some one put the title on a completely different movie and tried to pass it off as the original.  Buyer beware.,1290556800,7,170,4.090909090909091
8025358,1,B0002B54Y4,"Buyer beware! Not the correct movie. Movie box cover is the correct movie, but the movie itself is incorrect. I have been looking for this movie in dvd for years and I got suckered into buying the last 2 releases at amazon and both are not the correct movie. I have a vhs copy of the correct movie and I saw it in the theater in the early 70s. If you enjoy 70s martial arts movies, you will like this one if you ever get a chance to see the correct one. Actually had a good story and acting and good fight scenes for an actor who never became famous.",1227571200,10,550,4.009090909090909
