8640855,1,B00ICPPN3E,"When I ordered this disc, there was no mention of ""sequential 3D"" in the description.  I just got the disc (after waiting more than a month) and am depressed to find that this is not a 3D Blu Ray, is letterboxed in a 4:3 format, has non-removable sub-titles, and has no purpose for existing other than to collect money from the hopeful few waiting to have those hopes dashed.",1395792000,12,375,4.434782608695652
8640856,1,B00ICPPN3E,"The movie was not in Blu-Ray 3D but merely copied onto a Blu-Ray disc. It could have fit on a regular DVD, which I already owned.
The movie itself was in sequential 3D, which is nothing like the Blu-Ray 3D presently offered by the major studious. You cannot watch the movie in 3D using either progressive or active glasses. Again, this presentation in is sequential 3D.
The quality of the movie itself was so poor, that it was worthless in the first place. A Blu-Ray disc was simply the medium used to transfer the movie on to and that was a great waste of space.",1395360000,13,563,4.371428571428571
