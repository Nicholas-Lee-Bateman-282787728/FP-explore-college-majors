I have shown this DVD to teachers I have now and they remember either showing these films in their classrooms back in the day or they recolllect having been shown these films by their teachers in the 60's.

I did recieve a defective DVD at first. I contacted the seller through Amazon and they were very courteous and quick to send send me a replacement
copy which plays very nicely.",1316044800,,560,4.544554455445544
