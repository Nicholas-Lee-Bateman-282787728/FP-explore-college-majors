6248647,5,B00I3V92I4,"This is a great movie for a first time director/writer.  It has three short horror movies, wrapped into a larger movie.  The movie was well done, writing was also good.  The special effects were awesome.  Hopefully, this newbie director/writer puts out more movies.  It's always good to see someone else produce a horror movie instead of the same people.  As a matter of fact, I purchased several ""Dead on Appraisal""  DVDs for family and friends who enjoy a good horror.",1398902400,,470,4.8
6248648,4,B00I3V92I4,"When I first saw the cover for DEAD ON APPRAISAL, I knew I was in for a treat.  It immediately reminded me of an 80s cult-classic that I absolutely love: TERROR VISION.  And just like that gloriously gory throwback film, DEAD ON APPRAISAL does not disappoint in the least.  Crammed full of dark humor, gore, and scares, this is one low-budget gem that every horror fan needs to own.

As I mentioned, this is a low-budget picturebut the production team does a stellar job with the money.  IMDB estimates the films budget at $15,000, which would probably be pretty close.  But a good part of this is spent on special effects, and the result is a wildly entertaining gore-fest that will have you cheering as the chunks of flesh fly!

DEAD ON APPRAISAL is shot fairly well and the overall presence of the film onscreen is good.  My sole complaint about the cinematography is the lighting; there are several scenes that are not lit well enough to see what is happening.  A good example of this is in Father Land, when Robbie is looking at the book in his room.  We cannot see what he is looking at, although I assume it is something integral to the story.

The acting is not bad, about par for a low-budget film.  But there are a couple of performances that stick out.  Zack Fahey does a great job in his duel roles as Jerry and Freddie.  Likewise, James Howell shines as Robbies father in the Father Land segment.

But the special effects and the crazy stories win me over for this film.  DEAD ON APPRAISAL has some eye-popping gore that you simply must see to appreciate.  Each segment in the anthology shines in this aspect.  In The Morning After, my favorite scene showcases a mans head that is torn open from the top of his jaw on up.  Gore is an art form, and the special effects crew for this film have mastered it.

The puppets used in the final segment, Freddie and the Goblins, are kinda hokey, but they actually work for this film.  This is especially true once the carnage starts.  I won't go into great detail because you have to see it to appreciate itbut take my advice, and check it out.

DEAD ON APPRAISAL won't be for everyone, but gore-hounds and fans of campy horror should definitely check it out.  I loved it, and Im glad I have it in my film library.  I recommend giving it a look if you can stomach it.  If you can, its certainly a sight to behold.  The film hits store shelves tomorrow.",1396828800,7,2406,4.409090909090909
6248649,1,B00I3V92I4,"John Dante (Mike Pfaff) is a real estate agent attempting to sell a cursed house in this Brain Damage ""Creepshow"" style production. The house provides a common element for 3 separate tales. The first tale involves an alien insect infecting humans during a home break-in. The second episode involves a PTSD victim. The third is about a death metal band who hallucinates goblins, or whatever they were.

The film utilizes colored filters for many of the monster/special effect scenes. The props consist of rubber masks and gallons of fake blood. The film attempts to go after the cheese, but had difficulty making simple puns. The dialogue and acting were both bad.

Not a good rental. Watch at your own risk.

8638938,3,B00I3V92I4,"Dead On Apraisal takes the kitschy that only puppets and over-the-top gore effects can give and twists it with three dark, entertaining nightmares held together by a nice, piece that weaves the anthology together. Considering the whole film takes place in the same home, this anthology creates a nice angle to keep the film from seeming too cheap or hokey. It is kitschy, as I stated before but in a good way that somehow doesnt become boring.

The Morning After is a total tribute to the outrageously fun b-movies of old with some Tales From The Crypt flamboyance thrown in. Father Land goes a little darker and turns the tone of the anthology to a more serious level. Freddy And The Goblins manages to recapture the fun, upbeat tone of the Dead On Appraisal . The wrap-around, and glue is to this anthology is Closing Costs which has an almost Tales From The Darkside feel. It is melodramatic, surreal and our guide through these twisted tales.

The selling point for this is the fun, outrageous gimmicks the special effects bring to the table. Dead On Appraisal won't satisfy the hardcore, serious horror fan but those looking for something that is an easy-to-watch. It is a lighthearted flick filled with cheap, entertaining effects that the ""junk food"" horror fan will dig this. I did, and I didn't think I was gonna like it in the beginning.",1431129600,2,1347,4.727659574468085
8638939,1,B00I3V92I4,"""Dead on Appraisal"" is a boring but gory three part anthology film featuring a terrible script centered on a trite concept, poor acting, and ridiculously bad special effects. Given the budget I suppose it's a wonder there are any effects in the movie, but couldn't they have had fewer better effects rather than a lot of repetitive laughable ones?

The premise is that a beleaguered real estate agent is trying to unload a house with a horrible past. It's clearly haunted and everyone who lives there ends up dealing with grisly death. There is a lot of gore, but it isn't very realistic, and is even less coherent (the exploding soldier scene in ""Father Land"" is particularly annoying.) In the first part, ""The Morning After,"" we meet a lot of people we don't like and see a major entomological disaster of the highest magnitude. It only gets worse from there. Part two, ""Father Land,"" features an Iraq war veteran suffering from PTSD coming to the house to live with his father. It does not go well. This is probably the best acted of the three episodes, but the lighting is so dark it's sometimes hard to see key onscreen elements. As mentioned earlier, the explosively psychotic conclusion is open to interpretation and is just plain annoying. The worst episode of the three is ""Freddie and the Goblins"" about a heavy metal band that occupy the house until mayhem once again strikes. Note: the segue into this one is especially awkward, involving that old standby ""one year earlier...."" This actually makes the timeline a bit hard to follow if you stop and think about such things, particularly in light of the conversation about how long the house has been listed for sale at the end of the film. The music video scenes in part three are nearly unwatchable (and the soundtrack of the film in general is grating at best.)

In a stunning concept, the real estate agent's girlfriend ultimately tries to sell the house by putting on a...wait for it...knife show (ponder) at the end, opening the door to a final and bloody climax amongst a lot of loopy special effects, that, hilariously, involves confusing a demon with a squirrel. I love that this poor salesman is so involved with his (apparently) only listing that he worries day and night about selling this house instead of taking a more sensible approach and washing his hands of it and finding some better properties to peddle. The DVD contains two trailers and two unenlightening behind the scenes featurettes: watch for the sincere pontification on the craft of filmmaking! No, really!

""Dead on Appraisal"" is a gory frightfest. People who love pointless gore with little rational thinking might enjoy it I suppose, but I would expect that, like me, most viewers will quickly grow annoyed by and tired of the characters, the generally poor acting, the premise stretching, and particularly the creepy puppets.",1428624000,4,2868,4.848979591836735
