4890919,5,B005TK0WG8,I just love the pictures and updated sound quality from Bluray movies that were transfered from either VHS or older DVD's and so will YOU!!!!,1354579200,,141,4.68
4890920,1,B005TK0WG8,"Worse movie ever, there is a part of the movie that you can see a white camera that is at the end on the movie, poor budget etc don't buy it",1353196800,,140,3.5483870967741935
4890921,2,B005TK0WG8,"I will never watch this movie again.  This is drivel that is worse than much of what the sci-fi channel puts out.  It is simply bad.  Now I'll be the first to admit that you can enjoy a good bad movie.  And some people will enjoy this movie along those lines alone.  There are some funny quips (not moments, mind you, but quips) that the characters make (because just about everyone is a comedian in this movie) throughout the film.  Most are of the groan inducing varieties but there are a few chucklers such as when Olaf, the brutish and dim sidekick to Mathayus our hero, cracks wise about Mathayus' neatly groomed quaf and then says while Mathayus fights flirtatiously with heroine Silda, ""Man, I don't know who's hair is prettier!""  From the wild overacting of Ron Perlman as horse-faced King Horus (man, that dude has a chin!) to Billy Zane's goth-inspired King Talus, no line of dialogue is left unchewed.  This is camp that was filmed to be camp and appeal to guys...mostly between the ages of 12-16.  They'll probably like it and truth to tell it's also pretty tame despite the scenes of death and carnage on the battlefield (none of it is gruesome though the scenes where elephants are lying strewn around with spears poking out of them might bother some).  For adults...well, go back to ""The Mummy"" to enjoy some truly good camp.",1342051200,,1340,4.616033755274262

4890923,3,B005TK0WG8,Number 1 was very good. Number 2 was good. Number 3 is okay. Number 3 completes the trio. I am not sure a fourth would help the saga. All good things eventually come to and end...,1332547200,2,179,4.0
4890924,5,B005TK0WG8,this is a great move i would recamend to any one also amazon speedy service is out standing this is a action packed film and a great story !!!,1329523200,4,142,3.9310344827586206
4890925,1,B005TK0WG8,"This has to be the worst film of my collection.  The acting is so wooden, the stunts are anything but thrilling.  The dialogue is so wooden and cheap, that the writers should be beaten with thier manuscripts.  I have always been a fan of Ron Perlman's, but this time, no way. this isn't even a ""B"" movie, more like an ""F"" for faailure.",1328918400,,335,4.285714285714286
4890926,5,B005TK0WG8,"A little campy but all in all, its alot like the first film. It's more of a comedy and safe for kids to watch. Better than most movies out there. Thats why I give it five stars.",1327363200,3,177,3.810810810810811
4890927,1,B005TK0WG8,"I have a soft spot for the Mummy's sequels and spin offs.  But this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Don't get me wrong,the director and cast tried their best with an obviously low budget to make a decent movie. But they failed.

Therefore we ended up with a movie full of crappy acting, crappy story, low budget and sadly no redeeming point whatsoever. Let be put it this way, I would rather be stung three times by a deadly scorpion than to have to see this movie ever again.",1327017600,4,489,4.191489361702128
4890928,1,B005TK0WG8,"I've followed and enjoyed ""The Mummy""series.""The Scorpion King""was part of that series. It worked well with ""The Rock""Dwayne Johnson in the title role. The film that came out of ""The Mummy""series and co-starred Kelly Hu,was another great film. But,it seems that Hollywood now tries to drag out a good series,by sequelling a film to death. The directors of these attempts to retell the story fall incredibly short. Though,the actors are note worthy like Billy Zane and Ron Perlman,whose past films have greatly entertained us,they can't save this sinking ship of a movie. I think the film industry is desparate for a hit,and hasn't had one for a long time. If you want more bang for your buck,skip this film,and buy ""Cowboys and Aliens""",1326240000,4,735,4.983739837398374

4890931,5,B005TK0WG8,"Great  Movie!  One of the best movies in the Scorpion King franchise.  The Ron P. is fantastic and adds a lot of flare to the movie.  This movie could not be better and the characters really play their roles quite well.  Several years ago, the actors were B rated actors.  Now, they are active members in their own franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy.  But this movie and enjoy the Action!",1439683200,,393,4.450704225352113

4890943,4,B005TK0WG8,"I do not do video or music reviews because it is a matter of taste and seldom anything more.
I do review 3-D but that is a technological opinion and is subjective only to fact.
The reason I am commenting on this Blu-Ray is that this is also a Techno issue. I have never had this issue before but it is an issue. I have Panasonic 3-D equipment and my TV is a 60 inch Plasma so when I take a break I stop not pause a film. You cannot do that with this Blu-Ray because it will just start over again and it is a pain.
So I subtracted a star for the Techno Genius that wrote the program.",1409961600,,582,3.8583333333333334

4890946,5,B005TK0WG8,"Just saying, if you like this type of movie, you will like it. Billy Zane as the bad leader taking over all, with a good looking hair piece. Ron Perlman as the kind of good king doing what you'd expect, trying to take over all since his brother and an ally are all killed. The only problem, the Rock isn't in it.",1394323200,,312,4.048387096774194

8486266,5,B005TK0WG8,"Mathayus is a warrior from the Akkadian Empire trained into the Order of the Black Scorpion. There are a few glaring historical mistakes during the series, such as the Akkadian Empire ended around 2300 BC yet the lands between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers is described as 'desert' but back then it was rich grasslands, a bread basket, the Cradle of Civilization; it wasn't until the end of the Bronze Age which was about 1200 BC that the area of modern day Iraq began to turn to desert. Also, throughout the series we see Roman Armor and Medieval castles. We also see sword designs which would never survive in battle and armor which is totally fantastic. But all that aside, the series is not half bad although it must be considered a B-Movie series including skimpy outfits and sometimes cheesy lines. They fight scenes are pretty good. There is no frontal nudity although there are some suggestive dialog and situations.

The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior is the origin-story of Mathayus, the protaganist of the series. His co-star is a tom boyish kick butt girl and there is also another hard fighting character that is a goddess of love and war featured in the story. Mathayus' father is murdered by Black Magic and Mathayus sets out to revenge his father's death, traveling to the Underworld to retrieve a magic sword to kill his nemesis.

The Scorpion King stars The Rock and is the only film he appears in. An evil king is trying to take over the world, and doing quite nicely as he is using a sorceress who can foresee the future to tell him when to attack. A unit of Scorpion Warriors are hired as mercs to stop the evil King.

The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption stars Victor Webster as Mathayus after he loses his Wife and Kingdom. In this movie Mathayus goes to India and fights a guy who summons three dead heroes to aide him in conquering all of India. Mathayus teams up with a The Cobra who is fighting a guerrilla war against the bad guy. Again there are two tough female fighters in this movie with great fight scenes between them.

The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power again stars Victor Webster as Mathayus. In this movie our hero teams up with a displaced Princess and her crazy tinkerer father to over throw a power mad King and reinstate the rightful line onto the throne of a European mountain kingdom. This one has the most laughs in it.",1525478400,,2377,4.546728971962617
