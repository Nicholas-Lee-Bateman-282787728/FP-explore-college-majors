7222274,2,B00YIZWIRQ,"Lacking the merits of an engaging documentary, it fails to hold ones attention for long.  It's also marred by the very poor camera work. Minus depth it becomes a journey of tedium to the end, watching an elderly women spending her time shopping warrants at most a 10 minute TV segment, rather than a full length documentary at 80 minutes.

It feels like it was recorded over the course of a week or two, edited and released.

Wait for it to come out on Netflix or elsewhere if you're interested.",1439683200,6,495,4.477777777777778

7222548,2,B00YIZWIRQ,"I was a bit frustrated with this movie because it was too focused on IRIS - sort of an all about me movie.  Basically she is a shopholic that has an eye for quality and apparently could afford anything she likes.  Her style was too loud, prints and colors clashing (in my opinion).  I was impressed with her vintage clothing collection.  It makes one think about saving some special pieces during your lifetime..  To me, Iris was born under a lucky star and in my world, few folks are that fortunate.  I didn't care for her remark about pretty girls - thought it was cynical.  I wished the movie could have given me a good feeling message or gave me some inspiration but it left me thinking that I just watched a movie about a lady that could buy and do anything she wanted through life and benefited greatly from it. .",1445817600,2,819,4.348684210526316

It was also fun to watch her put together different pieces and create a ""statement"" that actually worked. Not something I would necessarily wear myself but the different elements came together like pieces of a puzzle to create a whole picture. In other words, the lady is an artist with an artist's eye and it is a joy to watch her do her thing and listen to her share her wisdom.",1445299200,3,504,4.372340425531915

I'm not really into fashion, myself, but I do find it interesting watching and listening to people who are. I guess it's an art form I appreciate, but am totally inept at engaging in myself. Despite my fashion aloofness, I found this story engaging. Iris is interesting and would capture my attention even if she were talking about shoelaces. Her story seems ordinary until you realize that her talented eye for design took her on a journey from being an unassuming interior designer to a featured artist at the Metropolitan Museum.  Her grass roots appeal engages viewers from the fashion illerates to those who actually know something of her art. I'm glad I saw this documentary.",1445126400,3,817,4.835714285714285

7222585,4,B00YIZWIRQ,"Here we see a documentary about the life of Iris Apfel and her husband who turns a 100 in the film. In England we might describe her as an eccentric. Her background was in interior design with a number of 'A' list wealthy clients and she traveled the world looking for inspiration and interior design objects/items. She certainly had a good eye for colour, textiles, prints and a love of ethnic items and big statement jewelry. Over her many years in the business she has acquired an astounding collection of textiles, furniture and art items (we see her trying to downsize) while also developing her own inimitable style, incredible knowledge and ideas that naturally lend themselves to the visual fashion and art world. She also likes a bargain and we see her bartering down prices with retailers. She also comes across as quite humble and astounded that at 93 years of age the world of fashion and art is so interested in her. Age cannot wither her, as she continues to work encouraging people not to be sheep and to take an individual approach to beauty, life, art, fashion and style. Iris is a leader and never a follower of fashion.

As part of the extras on the DVD Iris is interviewed by the fashion journalist Lisa Armstrong in front of a studio audience. While it is interesting, it is also an example on how not to conduct an interview and demonstrates the importance and need for proper preparation by the producer and interviewer. We see Iris almost having to be carried onto the stage in the most undignified manner and then struggling to hear what is said. Then both Lisa and Iris have hand help microphones, and Lisa keeps shoving Iris's hand held microphone into Iris's face as she is talking, so the audience can hear her. Frequently Lisa appears distracted and not fully engaged in the interview as she consults her written notes placed on a coffee table.",1444003200,8,1874,4.678787878787879
7222586,5,B00YIZWIRQ,"Inspiring, artistic, colorful film, Iris, is the story of a highly successful interior designer and collector whose hoard of one-of-a-kind, unique jewelry and clothing was recently discovered and was the subject of a show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  A buzzy, break-out success, Iris' show and fame continued to grow with interviews, a jewelry line, and articles in fashion mags that propelled her to fame even at 80 years old.  Called a ""rare bird of fashion,"" Iris dances to her own beat, lives her own, colorful life, and continues to inspire others in the world of art, fashion, and design.

A great ride for audiences who like fashion, clothing, art, design, eccentricity, New York City, free spirits, and sassy old women.

It does not outline her background, accomplishments, education, influences, history...etc.  She seems more like a rich hoarder of clothing, jewelry and gaudy interior ephemera than anything of substance.  The camera work, as noted by other viewers, is not very good, and the film does seem rather full of the tedium of following her around while she either shops or goes through her overstuffed apartments and storage warehouses.  She does have rather a fun eccentric flair, but it does not sustain the boring minutes spent watching shopping and digging around in closets that are poorly lit and out of focus.  Who is Iris really?  This film does not really shed light on anything but a superficial glimpse into her dimly lit wardrobe.",1441497600,2,817,4.884057971014493

The whole theater was cracking up - Iris is queen of the one-liners.  And of course there's the clothes, the jewelry, the savvy shopping, and how she stores her clothes and eventually donates them to museums.  All the details you want to know about.  But underlying her public life is her deep and abiding love for her 100-year-old husband and his love for her.  Well he adores her, and why not?  In addition to her honesty and candor, this is the aspect of her life that touched me most.  What a woman.  What a life.  What a joy she was to watch.
