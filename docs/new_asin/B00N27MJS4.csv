8675793,5,B00N27MJS4,"I loved Tyler Labine in Reaper, and T & D vs Evil, as well as, other shows. This show is really good, but like so many good ones these days, I doubt there will be a second season. This show is kind of in the vein of Reaper and Bored to Death, but even though I loved it, I would much rather see a continuation of Reaper than a second season of Deadbeat. But since that will never happen, I will follow Tyler Labine in what ever he choses to pursue next.

Now I must finish my Sock-Sam-and Ben muffin. They're nutritious and delicious...
