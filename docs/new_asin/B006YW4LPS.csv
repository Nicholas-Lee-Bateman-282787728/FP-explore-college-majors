8506617,4,B006YW4LPS,"This is one of the best ""historical"" martial arts movies I've ever seen. But the description is misleading in that it says ""language: English"", implying that the audio track is English dubbed. That is not the case. It is subtitled in English, but then again so is the less expensive version of this DVD. Had I known this, I would have ordered the one that costs $9.95 instead paying $25 for the exact same DVD.",1518220800,,410,4.48

My black belts and I found it very enjoyable!
In fact, they recommended it to me and I found it to be both historically educational and a good karate movie.",1507852800,,208,4.358974358974359

8506620,5,B006YW4LPS,"I've been a martial artist for about 40 years and have watched a lot of martial arts movies always hoping to find one that's good.... a rare thing.  This movie is one of those rarities, the real thing.  The karate is the real thing, real karate, real karateka.  I recommend it highly.",1244419200,,284,4.423076923076923
8506621,5,B006YW4LPS,"I learned about this movie by reading a wado-karate forum thread.
When I saw the trailer on youtube I was sure. This movie is different.
After watching it:
The movie shows karateka from Goju and Shotokan schools training real techniques and kata. There is a storyline that makes some sense, the images are beautiful and the fighting scenes are nice and well choreographed. It has a few typical karate clichs (which I enjoyed) and is sober and well balanced. A real joy to watch.
Maybe not a Kurosawa but still, anyone who loved Sanjuro Sugata (Judo) will also love this movie. One to watch!

I like 'em, and this is a very good martial arts movie.

The production values are great (I saw it with subtitles, so I don't know how well the translation to English version works).

There are multiple themes, including the appropriate use of violence (how bad do the bad guys have to be before you get to hit them?), exactly what purpose do martial arts serve in the context of the real world, and how does moral authority stack up against bad guys with guns?

This is also a movie that does homage to Star Wars (which did homage to the Kurosawa movies) and The Quiet Man, as well as The Magnificent Seven (which was itself homage to  Seven Samuri).

There is a bunch of focus on ""the words of Sensei"", sort of as a Zen Koan, but ultimately, there is no good analysis of the position of violence in social interaction, or when it's appropriate to use violence.

Summary: this is a movie. There are plot lines, many of which remain unresolved. There is some pretty cinematography.

But the movie, while beautiful, falls slightly short of what it should have been, if all the plot lines had been resolved.

I'm still giving it five stars because the cinematography was great, the marital arts sequences were beautiful (all the actors who performed as Sensei's students were in fact legit advanced black belts, one of them in Shotokan Karate), the music was scene-appropriate, and the scenes themselves, taken one by one, were all fully popcorn worthy.",1229731200,2,1577,4.664259927797834
