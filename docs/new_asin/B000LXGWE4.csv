Unperfect and flawed, Cagle exhibits  a mastery of filmmaking like no other film producer I know. Here he takes nothing and turns it into something. Microbudgeted at less than $1,000, this film stand at the top of my all time favorites. This film was put together by the team of Kenya Cagle & Sherman Jones. Jones who I understand was Cagle's mentor is the lead the director on the film and does an awesome job bringing this story to life. He understands performance and many scenes seem bigger than life as we see a relationship destroyed before our eyes. A family that has been together for years finds itself being torn apart once the biological father is released from prison and wants to participate in his children lives. I highly recommend this film!",1402185600,,856,4.863013698630137
8165077,5,B000LXGWE4,"Powerful acting, powerful story. Father Dad is one of the best independent films out there. James Anthony Jackson stars oppostie Kevin O'Driscal as they fight for the love of the beautiful Leila Velez. Precious Parham Cagle & Tajah Parham Cagle star as two sisters torn between the love of their real father versus the love of their step father. They are dragged into the marital conflict. It is a good movie written by a best seller author and a husband wife team. Andre Shanks, Kenyae Cagle and Jermaine Gabrial round out the cast. You do not want to miss what hapens when these young people walk in on Melyssah Mevour as her character attempts to abuse one of their friends!!!",1388102400,,679,4.666666666666667
