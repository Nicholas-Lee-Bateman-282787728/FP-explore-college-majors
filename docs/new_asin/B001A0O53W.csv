3445140,5,B001A0O53W,"I think this price MUST be some kind of mistake. It's for sell for one fifth the price elsewhere, RIGHT NOW.  I found the short version on my cable on demand, and the work out is fantastic. Lots of fun, too.",1231286400,,207,4.048780487804878
3445141,5,B001A0O53W,"I love cardioke! It's fun, motivating, and easy to do. It's a great exercise to do with family or friends. Im not sure why the dvd is so high, but if you decide to pay, its worth every penny.",1229212800,,191,3.923076923076923
3445142,5,B001A0O53W,"I have quite a few dance workout dvd programs and I have to say this is one of my favorites.  The more I did this, the more fun it became. You will learn songs and dances (which are easy to learn). I also like to take this along when I visit my relatives and we'll do some of the dances (which you can select individually) The children and adults enjoy this. Hope there's more to come from Billy and Sharon.  Recieved one dvd. I paid a much lower price for this. There's young people as well as older people included on the dvd.",1225670400,,528,4.116504854368932
3445143,5,B001A0O53W,"The first time I saw this workout was on DEMAND, it is a great video
I was also looking to buy this dvd, the cheapest I found it was on
exercisetv.
Amazon you really have to lower the price for this dvd, everyone
knows this dvd does not sell for the prices that are on here.",1281830400,,274,3.9107142857142856
3445144,3,B001A0O53W,"Thankfully I purchased a used copy for $34, but even for that price I was a little disappointed.  It is a fun and a moderate workout, but not much different than my old Jane Fonda or Richard Simmons videos, which I love and still use to this day.

I guess for the ""new"" price, I expected something unbelievably great! I recently joined a Zumba class once a week, which is so much better than this Cardioke.

Thank you.",1274054400,,418,4.333333333333333
3445145,5,B001A0O53W,"I want to buy Sharon Blanks song at the end of the workout. I am not sure of the title, I think it may be ""You Are Enough"" Anyone know where I can buy it?
Much thanks",1267920000,,166,3.5135135135135136
3445146,5,B001A0O53W,"I stumbled upon this workout on Comcast on demand also.  I loved the workout so much I purchased a copy of the DVD at [...] for about $[...] (after coupon).  I have never had a workout DVD that motivated me to ""just do it"" like the Cardioke workout.  It's fun, super easy to follow, high energy...just makes me want to sing and dance all day.  I don't even mind singing to the oldies...lol.  If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced, variety workout, you can't go wrong with this DVD.  AWESOME workout!!!

As for the people who are selling this DVD on Amazon.com for $[...] and up, you should be ashamed of yourselves and I'm really surprised that Amazon.com is allowing you all to do this.  It's just wrong...not to mention that now some people are blaming Amazon.com, Billy Jr. & Sharon Blanks for your um...GREED :>).  Just plain wrong!",1252886400,3,838,4.570469798657718
3445147,5,B001A0O53W,"I LOVE THE WORKOUT AND WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEPLACE TO PURCHASE IT, I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN A PRICE THIS MUCH SO I SEARCH AND SEARCH AND FOUND WHERE YOU CAN PURCHASE THIS FOR 15.99 EXERCISE TV.COM HAS IT FOR 15.99 PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE IM SURE YOU CAN COME UP WITH HUNDREDS OF IDEAS TO SPEND IT.

3445148,5,B001A0O53W,"Great DVD, DON'T BUY IT HERE. THis listing for $151.00 has to be a joke. It can be purchased all over the web for less than $20.00",1239408000,,130,3.8518518518518516
3445149,5,B001A0O53W,"I came across this workout on Comcast ON DEMAND. Its one of the most fun workouts I've ever done. Its easy, and it really does make you sweat. You almost forget how hard you're working because you are having so much fun. However, I think the selling strategy for this video is a complete rip-off. Its completely insane to list this DVD for $151.00 when its only $19.99 on the exericse TV website. But ironically as soon as the video becomes available its on back already order.  And while you are waiting for it to come off back order, COMCAST has pulled it from ON DEMAND. Its a terrible thing to do to the same customers that put money in your pocket in the first place. I'm very disappointed that Amazon would participate in such disrespect towards its customers, especially in this economy. If they are not careful, CARDIOKE will lose its fanbase before it even has a chance to be successful. I would never pay this much for a video... so I will be waiting until it becomes available, and if it doesn't, they will lose my money and I will move on to the next best workout video.",1236556800,25,1082,4.41
3445150,4,B001A0O53W,"I love the sample workout on comcast exercise on demand, but the price here is too high!  It's only $19.99 on excercisetv.tv, but it's on back order.  Maybe the demand is driving the price up?  Love the workout, but will wait for the price to drop a little first.  I'll stick to The Firm until then.",1235347200,2,299,4.285714285714286
3445151,4,B001A0O53W,I have been doing the cardioke program for about a month and I wanted to write about it and praise it!  At times you may feel slightly dorky but it is so much fun you won't care.  Plus I have lost 8 pounds in the first month and dropped a dress size.  I feel much firmer in my thighs also.  I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!,1233878400,4,327,3.909090909090909
3445152,5,B001A0O53W,"As everyone said this is a very high price.
But I've worked out to this with my mom and we had a BLAST!!!! I love how it's not all skinny people and that it has people of all ages, shapes and sizes. It's hard to exercise to a video when everyone is a size 0 to a size 4. It makes it discouraging! Not everyone is built the same :)
But I give this video 5 stars, and the price needs to be adjusted. Seriously!

8275766,5,B001A0O53W,For the first time I found a product that makes me wanna get up and exercise. Terrific video with a positive message about the way you should feel about yourself. I have already started recommending this video to friends.,1341014400,,221,4.6923076923076925
8275767,4,B001A0O53W,"I found this work out on Exercise TV on Demand and I loved it. I wasn't too sure about the concept of singing and working out, but I love it. I have been doing this work out for almost a year now. I am not one who sticks with an exercise program for very long. I am now 5 months pregnant and find that with some modification to the higher intensity moves, it still works. Billy is friendly and encouraging. It's good to see the back up people are of all shapes, sizes, and ages. The routines are easy enough to follow along. My mom is in great shape and she found it to be challenging. I would say skip buying it from an Amazon seller. Exercise TV has it for way cheaper.",1307923200,,671,4.052631578947368
8275768,5,B001A0O53W,"When I saw the previews of this I felt that wow I have to get this.  I did not purchase it from Amazon as I felt people were charging way too much, but I do not want to waste anymore time discussing that.  I bought it and I do not have any regrets.  It is so much fun and it does not feel like you are working out.  It is like you are dancing and just having fun with your buddies.",1297209600,,381,3.6666666666666665
