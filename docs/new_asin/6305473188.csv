7889945,5,6305473188,"Made when Hollywood was largely committed to providing escapism for audiences gripped by the Great Depression, King Vidor's OUR DAILY BREAD (UA,1934) was a radical departure in its honest, down to earth depiction of America's dismal economic situation. Undismayed by the studios' rejection of his film, director Vidor mortgaged his home and borrowed money to get it made. This ""never say die"" determination behind its making only seems fitting for a film whose premise is about that very same spirit.

Written by Vidor, OUR DAILY BREAD tells the story of a dispossessed urban couple who decide to try their luck at farming by organizing a co-operative community of tradesmen, all committed to establishing a livelihood of self-sufficiency off the land. Karen Morley and Tom Keene give heartfelt performances in the lead roles, with apt support from John Qualen as a Swede - a character he specialized in, Barbara Pepper as a brassy blonde, and Addison Richards as an escaped con who makes a noble sacrifice to benefit the cause.

The film exhibits the general attitude of most Americans who felt betrayed by politicians and business magnates whom they viewed as being directly responsible for the economic crisis. It also delivers a message of hope that, with mutual effort and determination, any obstacle can be overcome. When viewed within the context of its times, OUR DAILY BREAD can be better appreciated as being instrumental in lifting the spirits of a generation fallen on hard times. Propaganda or not, they needed a film like this. The final sequence in which workers are digging an irrigation ditch and the water is unleashed, racing down toward a parched cornfield, is one of the most exhilarating cinematic moments of all time.

Because straightforward, socially conscious films were considered taboo by the major studios, Vidor had difficulty getting OUR DAILY BREAD released. Charlie Chaplin, a close friend of Vidor's and co-founder of United Artists, saw the film's merits and insisted that the studio release it. Even so, the opening date was delayed until after California's race for governor, since it was felt that the election may be swayed in favor of Democratic candidate Upton Sinclair, whose policies reflected the socialist leanings of Vidor's film.

Over the years, OUR DAILY BREAD has had lousy distribution with dupey prints flooding the public domain circuit. The last word in quality on this classic title is Image Entertainment's DVD which came out first in 1999, and was re-issued in 2005. The source used for the transfer was King Vidor's personal 35mm print. Produced by David Shepard, this edition is absolutely immaculate. I've only known OUR DAILY BREAD via washed out PBS-TV broadcasts and Alpha's no better DVD from '04. Upon viewing Image's copy, it's as if my eyes were fully opened and I could appreciate a film I've always loved even more. The audio likewise is crystal clear, with dialog registering at a comfortable level. Alfred Newman's stirring score, so helpful to the film's emotional impact, is served well by this restoration. Included is King Vidor's prologue in which the director relates what inspired him to make the film.

For extras there's six short, insightful Depression era documentaries - CALIFORNIA ELECTION NEWS #1 and #2 (1934), THE PLOW THAT BROKE THE PLAINS (1936), THE RIVER (1937), POWER AND THE LAND (1940) and THE NEW FRONTIER (1934).

A landmark of its kind, OUR DAILY BREAD seems to echo a re-newed relevance as we try to cope with the current economic slump. As a chronicle of an important period in American history, this film compilation is indispensible, and I give it my highest recommendation.",1369958400,,3675,5.096345514950166
7889946,2,6305473188,"I've read several books on the Great Depression, and the experience of doing so was far superior to the films contained on this DVD. The feature film, 'Our Daily Bread,' was particularly disappointing, presenting a fictional, romanticized, and highly unrealistic view in which individuals unable to feed themselves from one day to the next and their families magically become able to do so when they form a commune on a farm somehow made available for the main protagonist's use. Wood, horses, tractors, and seed magically appear, as well as plenty of food while they await a first crop. The 'Dust Bowl' - doesn't even exist.

'The Plow that Broke the Plains' told how enormous increases in acreage under cultivation helped begin the Dust Bowl. No mention, however, of the labor-saving practice of shallow plowing using 'one-way' plows instead of the deeper 'Lister plows;' however, it did show how shallow the furrows were - unable to trap blown dust. Dust storm scenes were shown, but viewers were not given any overall information on the number of years, number of dust storms/year, or how the market for wheat collapsed from $2.00/bushel during WWII when Russian suppliers were cut off from the market, down to less than 25 cents (less than the cost of production) in 1930 after Russian supplies returned to the market, government price setting ceased, nor the impact on farmers' ability to pay off loans for land and equipment.

The two political short films covered the efforts of conservatives to smear Sinclair Lewis' campaign for governor of California - lots of ideology.",1361577600,,1581,5.030534351145038
7889947,5,6305473188,"This DVD has the movie ""The Plow that Broke the Plains"" of which Ken Burns used almost every frame of in his movie ""The Dust Bowl"". Here it is all in one piece. But there are may other other great films on this DVD. ""Our Daily Bread"" is unbeliveable considering the time it was made. And there are several movies made by the US government during the Great Depression that are worthwhile for their historical value.",1357603200,,414,4.4605263157894735

There are a number of films on the disc many of them famous, a few not so famous but they all capture the Depression through  fine story telling and acting.

When looking back we see that our current hardships are not as bad as that of the former generations and gives us the strength to overcome these hardships of today.""  We have more social programs today, we can connect through the internet and we know what is happening throughout the United States, we don't have to travel unknowingly to find work to support our families.

7889950,4,6305473188,"(3 1/2 *'s) `Films of the Great Depression' isn't (or aren't if each are considered separately) great cinema, but it is a fascinating archive for a quaint time in American history when everything was far more difficult and dear than today.  `Our Daily Bread' is the only feature with actual actors, and the rest are mostly government supplied documentaries on New Deal programs and their before and after resonance in people's live during the Depression.  `The River' shows commerce and livelihoods as their effected by the Tennessee Valley Authority (or TVA), and `The Power of the Land' demonstrates how government programs enabled rural residents to hook up with electricity and make their lives easier.  `The California Election News' is distinctive.  While the issues aren't laid out before the viewer, the participants answers are revealing enough to fill in the gaps.  An interviewer asks people of several walks of life whom they're voting for in the governor's election.  The interviewees state their preference and why they'd vote for a certain candidate. 'Our Daily Bread' showcases a fairy tale of sorts about a community coming together to share work and possessions while overcoming pernicious poverty and drought.  While the acting isn't great, one could imagine Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland filling the leading roles nicely instead.

It's understandable the praise that's been heaped upon `Films of the Great Depression'.  It's an interesting piece of time travel that documents a difficult time in America.",1185753600,3,1525,5.2946058091286305
7889951,5,6305473188,"If you're interested in getting this excellent compilation of films about the Great Depression, then please note that Image Entertainment re-released this DVD in late 2005.  The cover is slightly different, featuring a still photo of two children from ""The River.""  For some reason, Image hasn't been on the ball lately, and many e-tailers (including Amazon) continue to list this title -- as well as the silent documentaries ""Grass"" and ""Chang"" -- as out of print.  It isn't.  You can still find it here occasionally and with e-tailers who specialize in rare and hard-to-find DVDs (like Facets).  There's no reason to pay more than $30 for this title unless you want the OOP 1st issue.

The movies themselves:  As John Marr points out in his review below, ""Our Daily Bread"" is a little dated and corny in its story and acting, but it's still a fine movie made by a superb American director, King Vidor.  Vidor made this movie independently -- hence some of the non-professional actors.  But it's well-crafted and features an astonishing and now-classic irrigation sequence at the climax.  The other films vary in quality, but all of them are historically important.  ""The New Frontier"" is a short piece of fluff news about the kind of cooperative community that inspired ""Our Daily Bread.""  The two California newsreels are infamous for having used professional actors and not ""average joes""; historians think that these propoganda pieces helped defeat the left-wing Upton Sinclair during his gubernatorial bid in 1934.  (The first newsreel is actually quite subtle, but the second is pretty transparent.)  More artistically interesting are the three documentaries:  Pare Lorentz's ""Plow that Broke the Plains"" and ""The River"" and Joris Ivens' ""Power and the Land.""  These docus used to be part of the standard curriculum in film classes, and they're excellent examples of montage (juxtaposing different images to create a sense of connection between two seemingly distinct events/ideas).  ""The Plow that Broke the Plains"" famously connects the Dust Bowl of the 1930s to WWI, when farmers were encouraged to cultivate all their land for the war effort rather than leave any portions fallow.  Personally, I prefer Ivens' ""Power and the Land"" -- he humanizes/personalizes his story by focusing on one (very photogenic) Ohio family.

As for the DVD:  Quality varies quite a bit here, too.  The centerpiece, ""Our Daily Bread,"" is superb.  Film preservationist David Shepard bought Vidor's private copy of this film -- even though the movie had fallen into public domain -- just to conduct a high-quality restoration.  In my opinion, Shepard's work on ""Our Daily Bread"" ranks as one of his finest achievements.  It's clearly superior to all other (and cheaper) editions of this movie.  The shorter pieces are OK.  Fortunately, all but ""The New Frontier"" were transferred progressively, so even though they aren't in the best of shape, they look quite good on high resolution monitors.

Overall, this DVD is a real gem for movie buffs and especially for fans of King Vidor or historic documentaries.  Although it may be hard to find the 2005 re-release, it's well worth your while.  (And shame on Image Entertainment for not marketing this title more aggressively.)",1136764800,36,3260,5.132827324478178

7889953,4,6305473188,"I apologize to those who read my previous (and only) review of this DVD. It was about the ""same time"", but wrong DVD! I meant to refer to ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime."" This documentary IS great! Not to say that ""Our Daily Bread"" is not. I mixed the two DVD casettes, and for hopefully obvious reasons,and gave the rave to the wrong product, as well as my statement about the Mississippi flood. Mea culpa.
Our Daily Bread is ... however. The film is somewhat dated and moralistic, but the (socialistic)solution-ending is wonderful. Value-added clips from other Depression movies and archived newsreel footage make it a worthwhile choice for those interested in King Vidor and all those elements mostly forgotten, about the Great Depression.  Buy them both!

7889954,5,6305473188,"There are very few movies I chose to see again and again, and fewer still when it comes to documentaries. However this film is filled with wonderful period pieces -- mostly carefully chosen newsreel and movie clips -- that weave a woeful tale of the Depression. Strangely enough,the film is almost exhilarating, showing the courage and perseverance of individual Americans as well as the country as they faced the 1929 Crash and struggled through the grim thirties. There are dozens of carefully chosen movie clips using characters portrayed by Cagney,Bogart,etc., as well as many other lesser known actors and films dealing with very real issues of survival. I bought this DVD three years ago. When I went to purchase it for a friend I was surprised to see that no one had reviewed it!  It deserves five stars and a much wider audience. (There is a short film, ""The River"", about the 1937 Mississippi flood, which by itself is worth the price of the DVD.)",1014681600,25,956,4.793939393939394
