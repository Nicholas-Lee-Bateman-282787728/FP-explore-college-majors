8590891,4,B00BG4RNCW,"This is a set by echo bridge home entertainment. The movies on this set aren't the best low budget disaster movies, but they work. For $8 this set was worth it to me. One note to point out however is that the vudu digital code doesn't work anymore. It expired on 12/31/2013. Had to figure that out myself but it will be helpful to you guys looking at this set. The quality of the movies... Meh. You can get sometimes up to 18 mbps, but is usually 10 mbps average, a little bit above your average DVD nowadays. In some scenes, the ""fuzz"" is so bad that it looks like you're 15 miles away from an old analog tv station watching it live. Nostalgic, but not wanted on a blu ray. The DVD version gets you 3-4 mbps average. Thanks for reading and I hope this review helps in your decision to purchase this set or not.",1444521600,,811,4.171974522292993
