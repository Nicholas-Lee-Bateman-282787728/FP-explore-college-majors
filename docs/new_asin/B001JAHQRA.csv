3655676,5,B001JAHQRA,"Love the love boat and so do my nine year old twin daughters!  Please release an entire season at a time!  This half a season thing is nuts!  I will be retiring before i get all the seasons at this rate!  Speed up and lets pretend we are in the year 2011.  Oh, i am sorry ""WE ARE""!  Please speed up the process!  Waiting anxiously in Ky!",1298851200,6,337,3.9402985074626864
3655677,5,B001JAHQRA,The Love Boat and Fantasy Island are two of my favorite shows of all time. Waiting for them to be released on DVD has been frustrating in the least. I have an idea. Why not release them in digital format so that those of us that want them can get them? You could also provide them in a burn on demand format. That way you are seeing almost complete profit and those of us that love these shows can get our hands on them. Just a thought.,1294185600,2,436,4.022988505747127
3655678,5,B001JAHQRA,If I wait any longer The Love Boat is going to sink! Why do you make your customers buy in bits and pieces? ...and then the wait time for each Season and Volume is too long!,1293321600,3,173,3.8333333333333335
3655679,5,B001JAHQRA,I am getting tire of waiting also.  I see many series released that did not run any where near as long as the love boat.  What is the hold up?,1285459200,6,142,3.7
3655680,5,B001JAHQRA,"What is the holdup for releasing the Season 3 DVD for Love Boat?  I love this show, please give us more info on why there is such a long delay.  Waiting!",1276214400,7,153,3.903225806451613
3655681,5,B001JAHQRA,"The Love Boat was one of the best television shows from the late 70's early 80's. WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG TO RELEASE SEASON 3 AND THE REST OF THE SEASONS? And please, when you do release them release the full season, not half seasons! We Love Boat fans have been waiting too long for this! I went through the same thing with ""The Facts of Life"" and finally I have just received season 4. Hurry up and get ""The Love Boat"" out of the dock and into our DVD players!",1272931200,76,461,4.076923076923077
3655682,5,B001JAHQRA,"Believe it or not, my grandchildren love this show just as much as the rest of the family.  Good fun!  I bought Seasons 1 & 2 and am anxiously awaiting Season 3.  Why is it so difficult to release this season??  Please let's get this copy soon.",1270512000,53,244,4.127659574468085
3655683,5,B001JAHQRA,"Come on already!  Enough is enough.  I'm tired of you guys nickel and diming us to death to purchase half a season at a time...and then decide that it isn't worth your while to release the rest of the seasons.  Perhaps if you released full seasons at a time like most other releases, you would see the return you hope to see!

I am very disappointed with this company, and hope another company will be sold the rights to produce these DVD's responsibly!",1270252800,89,453,4.421686746987952
3655684,5,B001JAHQRA,"Love Boat, Season Three, was fantastic.  It's unfortunate, I can't give more details, because it was a long time ago when I saw it.

PLEASE CBS - SELL US LOVE BOAT SEASON THREE.  Don't you want to make money?  There are so many of us wanting Season Three.  I promise I'll buy several copies.  You have such a large number of people on your payroll, while we teachers languish with larger and larger classrooms.  We need Love Boat.  Can't one person simply find a way to release on DVD's?  Even I know how to burn a DVD....

If there are legal/copyright problems - please, have a press release, pretty please.",1266710400,18,608,4.445454545454545

3655814,4,B001JAHQRA,"My husband and I have watched all of seasons 1 & 2. Where is Season 3, for Pete's sake? If one is unable to take a real cruise and is not free to pursue a new romance, then the Love Boat series helps us to at least live vicariously.",1365033600,4,232,3.7551020408163267
3655815,5,B001JAHQRA,"What does it take to get this company to release more seasons of the Love Boat. It's nice being able to watch a good show with your family and kids without having to worry whether you have to monitor the content. This is a great show which a whole new generation is beginning to know. Start selling season 3, enough already!",1353024000,3,324,4.327868852459017
3655816,5,B001JAHQRA,"I'm not writing this just for ""The Love Boat"", but for many TV Shows as well. I understand that if certain TV shows don't get the expected sales, the studios have no reason to continue making the DVD's. But isn't there some other way of determining how many consumers will buy the show. Like, put the entire series on DVD, rather than this season by season nonsense? I also understand it's costly to make DVD's (not to mention all the copies that have to be made). But even if it is costly, the entire series should be put on DVD, at least for fans of the show, if not the general public. I don't think it's fair to fans of these shows to not finish putting them on DVD, just because no one else wants to buy any (or any more) seasons. And if a show doesn't finish its DVD releases, then it's just a waste of discs, not to mention time and effort. Fortunately, for some TV shows that have Unfinished business on DVD, the rest of the seasons have at least been available online (such as Shout Factory!, for example). Anyway, the rest of the ""Love Boat"" series (sans a couple of episodes) can be viewed on You Tube, fortunately.",1348012800,,1126,4.316037735849057
3655817,5,B001JAHQRA,"This was on from 1977-1986 but they have ONLY released 2 broken  up seasons! WHY? Release complete seasons PLEASE! There are enough people that would buy it IF they would release it! We loved this show, they don't make decent shows anymore so we buy all the old shows we loved to watch.",1347667200,,286,4.39622641509434
3655818,5,B001JAHQRA,"I am sick an tired of buying these t.v. series, that I loved growing up and would love to see again and let my children watch. Only to find out that the companies that own the rights to these t.v. shows, won't release the entire series like they promised. I now have several incomplete t.v. series in my collection (C.H.i. P.s, Facts of Life, Fame and Love Boat), and I absolutly hate it. If the company would like to see if they would sell, why not have a pre-order of the ""complete"" series and see and release them that way first, then release them individually after that. Makes more sense, that way they don't lose any money for unwanted dvd's not purchased.",1345334400,,662,4.434426229508197
3655819,5,B001JAHQRA,Release it soon. I've taken to reading behind the scenes cruise ship stories to satisfy the craving for more. But the fans are asking and I've joined the queue.,1339286400,,160,4.551724137931035
3655820,5,B001JAHQRA,"Oh Come on! Fair is fair I absolutely love this show, where can I get the rest of it I have season 1 and 2 but would kill for the rest of it!!!! Definately nasty to only realease half of it!!!!",1337126400,,193,3.731707317073171
3655821,5,B001JAHQRA,"Please, is one of my favorite series. I have been waiting for over two years, can someone explain why they haven't put the rest of the seasons out yet?",1335830400,2,151,4.241379310344827
3655861,5,B001JAHQRA,I absolutely adore this series. I snapped up the first two seasons and have even been watching any re-runs i can find.  PLEEESE..  surely there is sufficient audience to buy season three and onwards?  for heaven's sake they have already released season two of Fantasy Island. Please release this. It is fun for all the family,1334966400,,325,4.767857142857143
3655862,5,B001JAHQRA,"Fine. I give up, Paramount. You want to release season three as two separate half-seasons? Okay with me.

You want to charge more for each half than most other shows of that era cost for the full season (and sometimes the complete series)? Go right ahead. I won't mind.

Heck, you can release season three as individual, single episode discs for all I care. And charge me out the wazoo if you want. If that's what's holding you back, then go right ahead.

Whatever it takes. Just RELEASE SEASON THREE already! Please?

It's not like we're asking for some obscure, niche show like ""Holmes and Yo Yo"" or ""Cop Rock"". This is ""The Love Boat"" we're talking about. It's a pop-culture juggernaut that ran for nine seasons.

Nine seasons, fer-cryin-out-loud!

(Well, maybe you don't have to be in a big rush to release those last few seasons, but still, is the third one too much to ask for?)

Right now, with a few clicks on Amazon, I can buy season three of ""Three's Company"", or ""The Dukes of Hazzard"", or ""The Jeffersons"", or ""Little House on the Prairie"", or even ""The Greatest American Hero"". Are we to believe that ""The Love Boat"" doesn't deserve a place in this pantheon?

Is it money? Is that it? Do you just not have the budget to produce this release? Because I've got a few bucks you could borrow. Or maybe we could all hold a bake sale or a charity car wash or something? Just swallow your pride, Paramount, and let me know. Nothing to be ashamed of.",1328659200,21,1455,4.464150943396226
3655863,5,B001JAHQRA,"With all the crap on tv these days, I've been playing The Love Boat for my kids instead.  It's such a fun uplifting funny show without all the cussing and porn that's shown on primetime tv or the commercials these days.  My kids love The Love Boat, even the grown up kids.  After all this time, it's fresh and entertaining.  Please release the rest of them!",1326931200,16,357,4.363636363636363
3655864,5,B001JAHQRA,"I've been waiting for Season 3, and am very disappointed to hear that they won't be putting the rest of the seasons of Love Boat on DVD!  I have been checking regularly to see when it is available!  C'mon folks!  Get it together!  There ARE people out here who WANT to spend money on this series!  And please, please, please.....sell it in full seasons!  What's up with this half season ****?

3655867,5,B001JAHQRA,I have to join the chorus and agree....when will Season 3 be released?  It is so frustrating to wait for a show to finally be put on DVD and they have to wait YEARS in between seasons.  I love this show and would like to finally see all of the episodes!!  Hurry up!,1308096000,15,265,3.9622641509433962
3655868,5,B001JAHQRA,"I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE KEPT ME SO INTERESTED AND GLUED TO THESE OLD TELEVISION SHOWS IS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE SO WATCHABLE. NOW YOU TAKE LOVE BOAT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CREW TOOK A CRUISE SOMEWHERE FUN, INTERESTING, AND ENTERTAINING ALL THE TIME. THAT WAS THEN LACED WITH ROMANCE, EXCITEMENT AND ADVENTURE. SOME FOLKS FOUND LOVE. AND SOME FOUND THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE. BUT ALL IN ALL, IT WAS ALWAYS A GREAT TRIP. OF COURSE WE FANS KNOW IT WAS MOSTLY FANTASY ENCOURAGED ON WITH THAT OPENING THEME SONG: ""THE LOVE BOAT,"" SANG BY JACK JONES. THANKS TO THE LOVE BOAT, I AM NOW A HUGE FAN OF JACK JONES. THE THING I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS WHAT IS PARAMOUNT WAITING FOR? WHY DON'T THEY RELEASED THE REST OF THE SEASONS? I GUESS UNLIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD, THEY MUST NOT WANT OR NEED ANY MONEY. BECAUSE I CAN JUST ABOUT GUARANTEE THAT IF THEY RELEASED IT TOMORROW, LOVE BOAT FANS WOULD BE RIGHT THERE WITH CASH AND CREDIT CARDS IN HAND TO GET THEIR LONG AWAITED COPY. COME ON PARAMOUNT, DO THE RIGHT THING BY THE LOVE BOAT FANS. RELEASE THE REST OF THE SERIES SOON.",1307059200,3,1067,4.34
3655869,5,B001JAHQRA,"Please finish putting out the Love Boat catalog! Paramount, if you wait too long, there will be no one left who even REMEMBERS the show, let alone would pay good money to buy it on DVD.
Give us our kitsch! We want the Love Boat! We are willing to PAY you for it- tell THAT to the music industry and see what THEY say! Take the money, and release the Love Boat!

8312498,5,B001JAHQRA,I grew up watching the series and now I would love to rematch them. I already have both vol. 1 & 2 of each season and would love to have all the rest of them. Please CBS release the remaining seasons. You would probably make a killing if you sell the entire season in one volume instead of two.

I've seen less popular old shows get their seasons released... why not shows as huge as Love Boat and Fantasy Island?? Hell, you can even make 'em MOD!!! DVD-R's are better than nothing! Some of the best seasons have yet to be released too... it's a shame.",1400630400,3,437,4.265060240963855

8312503,5,B001JAHQRA,"I purchased seasons 1 and 2 on a whim.  I happened to see them on the shelf at Wal-Mart one day when looking at movies.  I remembered my parents watching the show when I was a kid and it spurred good memories.  I purchased both seasons that day.  My husband and I both really love the show!  We watch it often.  We do not understand why additional seasons are not being released on DVD.  What gives??  This is a GOOD show.  It has a charm and a sweetness to it.  Yes, like all retro television shows, it's a little bit corny.  But corny is good!  This world could seriously use a little more corny!  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE unlock the vaults and give us the rest of the show!!",1382486400,3,673,4.1640625
