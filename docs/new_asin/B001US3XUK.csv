3803722,5,B001US3XUK,"Charming, funny and heartwarming. I recommend watching the episodes in order and all the way through to the end. I won't say anything about the plot. If you enjoy anime, then add this to your collection and enjoy every minute.",1225670400,,226,4.675
3803723,5,B001US3XUK,Like a lot of good anime it starts out slow and confusing but really clears up by the middle episodes where it jumps to it's true epic status. Beautiful story. This DVD set is worth it.,1224806400,,185,4.166666666666667
3803724,3,B001US3XUK,"First off, squeezing a 26-episode show on 3 DVDs is murder to video quality. That being said, it's not bad.
I think there are enough reviews of this show on the web, so I think I'll add my bit of salt to the ""bootleg"" discussion.

This looks a lot like the Malay version of the series I bought, which seems perfectly legal, as it had all regulation office stickers on it. And I got it from a brand-new shopping mall, mind.
20 bucks does not mean bootleg. In some countries of the world, 20 bucks are A LOT of money. It makes no sense to market anime which nobody can afford.
However, I have my doubts about the legality of selling this version on amazon ....",1207008000,2,658,4.222222222222222
3803725,5,B001US3XUK,"I got this set for the bootleg, quality is good, here is how to identify a good price and a bad price,
89.00 and then some for the Amazon priced licensed ones, and 20.00 for bootleg, do the math, bootleg is the outcome of over priced anime. the 3 disc makes more sense too, as the folks who do the licensed one do 6 to 7 disk to rip us off. All these anti bootleg anime been seeing on Amazon is sad, I guess everyone outthere is fine with paying upwards of 200.00 for anime, oh wait, they just download it now for free, because bootleg is bad. Just read anmie insider, to find out how well its going with the high priced anmie, like I said, bootleg happens.",1205971200,2,657,4.10077519379845
3803726,1,B001US3XUK,"Remember people, here is how to identify bootlegs:

1. Region: All Regions (or Region 0.) If you see this, most likely it's a bootleg. The official USA version is Region 1 (R1)!

2. No. of discs: bootlegs usually have 3 discs, which are of low quality compared to R1's 6 or 7 DVDs.

3. Cheap prices that are too good to be true. In this case, ask the seller about the product's region code.

4. Seller descriptions: ""Import"" or ""different cover...blah blah blah."" Bootleg is bootleg, don't try to sugarcoat it.

As for the show itself. To sum up in one word: fantastic. Great animation, character designs, story, music, English voice acting, and most importantly, great replayability. 5/5",1191456000,17,688,4.796610169491525
3803727,5,B001US3XUK,Rarely does a studio knock it out of the park after prior failures. It's a tale of people who live in this artificial hour glass world. They have an ongoing war between the people who live on the top and the ones who live on the bottom. The third power is a micro nation that controls the middle territory. Behind the scenes they have been fueling the war. This is mostly told through the prospective of two letter carriers who get involved in this struggle to save their world from the guild.,1458518400,,493,4.369565217391305
3803728,5,B001US3XUK,"I really liked the dynamic characters.  There were a few over dramatic parts, but done with great humor, so for a Japanese Anime, very well done!

The art is one of my favorite aspect of this series.  I also really like steampunk-type stuff, and while this does not match this genre perfectly, it does a pretty good job at fitting the bill.",1457049600,,340,4.451612903225806

There was one problem however, the third disk had an area where the video began to have read problems and eventually stopped altogether. it was fixed by washing the disk (just wiping it with a cloth didn't work). This makes me wonder if my copy was a prior return. This is the only reason why I did not award this item a 5 star rating.",1422835200,,439,4.238095238095238

3803755,5,B001US3XUK,"This is a rather cute little show, it has a good cast dynamic and the characters rather than speaking in the same room at each other, actually seem to speak with each other which is an issue in even block buster anime's. There is some very good animation, and its hard to pick out scenes where they are still framing or using stationary objects and characters, it's rather tastefully done.

The story itself is pretty good, there's a lot of fridge logic if you dig deep, but the story up front and center does its duty... You can't help but feel it really needed to be explored a bit more and have some more time to do what it wanted! But I guess it does give it a very quick pacing, mixed with some very slow moments that would just benefit from more exposition on the world they live in... There are some amazing settings and set pieces that just are never explained and could have used a couple extra episodes!

Whoever said too much of a good thing was a dink.",1412726400,,964,4.291208791208791

Excellent combination of 3d and hand drawn elements.  Richer that most anime, not at all wooden or flat, but dimensional and broad ranging with believable vistas and excellent atmospheres.  The costuming and prop design is so unique and unusually detailed.  I really enjoyed the steampunk aesthetic of this series.  Story line was really quite good.",1408838400,,523,4.942528735632184

Two orphans struggling to survive as air couriers in a war torn world in which nothing is ever as it seems. When they enter a race with other couriers, an accident pulls them into a much bigger conflict that they thought possible. Filled with a cast of interesting and unique characters, awkward situations, witty dialogue, and amazing airships, this is one series that comes close to having something for everyone. From temper tantrums to hair raising midair hairpin turns, the action and comedy really sets this series apart from anything else in this genre.

This is one series you will want to watch to its very end, as it keeps you on the edge of your set. This is action and adventure at its finest.",1396569600,,792,4.577464788732394

To enjoy this show you just have to except these things and move on. What I think makes this show good is the suspense and adventure. The show does a good job of making you keep guessing what exile is and other questions that the show gives the viewer. The adventure of this story makes you just fill good, which I really liked, and you could really root for the characters.",1393977600,,537,4.2745098039215685
3803765,1,B001US3XUK,"Being an anime fan for quite a while now, I don't like wasting my time or hard earned cash when purchasing anime series, movies, or OVA. Therefore, It stands to reason that I wouldn't like this show. I stopped watching this series after four episodes because I simply never connected with any of the characters, themes, or the half baked world that gets haphazardly presented throughout. To put it simply, none of it was convincing or compelling in any way.

The animation was not bad and the steam-punk designs were nice, but the CG was, when compared with other titles released around the same time, not great. The larger set piece battles were awkwardly set up, absurdly carried out, and downright painful to watch. If your thinking of buying this, I would recommend watching the first few episodes online first. You might come to the same conclusion and save money for a better series.",1393891200,5,889,4.7727272727272725

I loved it from start to finish.  The sets and props are fantastic.  The characters are unbelievably believable and endearing, and the story and plot is enduring.

There was one episode that seemed a bit discombobulated, but I just let it run and figured stuff out - well worth the cost of admission.

People should check this out as soon as you can afford it> Netflix has a crappy collection of anime that's mostly not worth your time so purchasing has its ups on that! The steam punk feel of this anime is definitely a stand alone. the Second Season of this anime is terrible don't buy it Stream it you'll save a lot of money for it too!

3803770,5,B001US3XUK,"I've seen a lot of anime, but Last Exile is my clear favorite.  The animation is excellent, the characters are compelling, and the mix of old and new technologies gives the story a gritty, nostalgic feel.  If you have a hard time digesting how very different technologies coexist, all is explained eventually.  The music is equally excellent.  Last Exile is to anime what The Lord of the Rings is to fantasy films: It sets the bar so high that it may never be reached by another film.",1389052800,,484,4.528735632183908

Parts of this storyline would fit well as a Square Enix ""Final Fantasy"" plot; it has a similar feel in following a small team of friends from daily struggles all the way through a world-rocking exposition of secret powers.  It even has a chocobo racing episode.  It's also got a little bit of the feel of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steamboy/dp/B0041KY3V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steamboy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-in-the-Sky/dp/B002ZTQVHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle in the Sky</a>.

Looks like 2 sides fighting for limited resources and both have possession of flight due to flying fortresses/battleships from a 3rd party, that is not really neutral, but controls progress of the other 2 by design.  A boy and a girl struggle their way through life with each other to one day follow in the footsteps of their father's to beat the Grand Stream.

3803781,3,B001US3XUK,"Last Exile is one of those shows with an amazing premise, some strong characters, good action, and an interesting lore and world for a story to take place in. Anime is a genra for strong imaginations, and Last Exile has that in spades, from the world the series is set in to the weapons of war which its nations use. So why only three stars? By all appearances LE  has all the trappings of a great show, and has gathered quite the following, and for good reason. Dont let my rating fool you, this is a good show which a lot of people will enjoy. Its not one of those clearly overrated pieces of trash which I love to bash into (looking at you Elfen Lied) but it does have its share of flaws which, to me, held the show back considerably from living up to its full potential.

The premise is quite simple, deceptively so even. There are few animes out there which have managed to grab my attention so early, yet lose it so quickly. Dusis and Anatore, two powerful superpowers who dominate what little land is left inhabitable on the planets surface, are at war. To open the series viewers are treated to a gripping opening scene of two fleets of enormous flying battle ships sailing side by side, as teams of worthless riflemen fire at one another from ship to ship. Right off the bat the idiocy of the politics in this world are brought to light (and I mean that as a compliment); the riflemen on board serve no useful purpose, they cant sink the enemy ship, they are never used for boarding either, are simply forgotten about after their numbers start to dwindle. They really are not good for anything except catching bullets, yet the captains of these enormous battleships insist on sacrificing them by the hundreds in order to fulfill a sense of chivalry, and obey the rules of war as it were. We are thrust into the boots of one lonely foot soldier, huddling afraid in the bowls of the ship as they prepare to open the doors and march out into the line of fire. It is a truly harrowing setting that reminded me not only of the battle formations made famous by Napoleon, but also of the charges across no mans land in WWI. The riflemen fighting all know that their chances of survival are slim, and they know how pointless their sacrifice really is, but they march into the line of fire anyway prepared to give their lives away. It presents a very antiwar message, while also treating audiences to a very beautiful battle scene. Of all the things Last Exile got right, the opening is high amongst them.

Then there are our two main characters, Clause and Lavi who are two orphaned children whove taken up Vanship piloting as a means to support themselves  (a Vanship being a sort of airplane with anti-gravity technology of the same kind the battleships use). Of all the characters in the show, early Lavi is my favorite (and theres a big difference between early Lavi and late Lavi). Shes a confident, strong, take charge type of characters with a very close relationship to her best friend, Clause. The reason I liked her most I guess is because out of all of them she seemed the most believable. Whereas other characters go around doing stupid things to save girls in distress Lavi early on makes it clear she wants nothing to do with the dangerous missions Clause gets them into. This may seem selfish to some, but its also the most realistic portrayal in the series. Why should she want to risk her life for a mission she cares nothing about, or people shes never met? No one else seems to have a problem with doing just that, so Lavis reluctance stood out in stark contrast to the sometimes baffling illogical decisions some of the characters make. But more on that later.

While taking part of a race in their home town Lavi and Clause unwittingly rescue a young girl name Ai (at least that was her name in the sub I watched) and become mixed in with a plot to destroy The Guild, an almost supernaturally powerful organization which controls the technology to all flight.  After an all too brief battle with a Guild starship (literally planes that look like stars) they end up on the legendary Battleship Sylivanna captioned by the personality less Captain Alex, his love struck second in command Sophia, and his head fighter pilot the emotionally unbalanced Tatiana and her (supposedly) lesbian lover. Okay, that last part isn't really said outright, but it did give me that vibe. When Clause and Lavi deliver Ai to the Sylivanna, which was their mission from the start, Clause for some reason suddenly distrusts the crew and decides Ai needs rescuing.

And this, in my opinion, is where the show starts to fall apart. See, Clause from the very beginning has no reason to think Ai is in any danger, or that she needs rescuing. In fact the Sylivanna crew just saved Ai from being killed, and were taking her on board their ship for protection. Sure, one of the men handles her kind of roughly, but hes quickly scolded by the Captain for doing so. Despite doing exactly it was he was supposed to do, IE delivering this girl to the Sylivanna, Clause now thinks it a good idea to risk his life, and the life of his best friend, to rescue a girl he hardly knows from the very people hed risked his life to deliver her to. For no reason.

Its these kinds of lapses in logic that really hold the show back. Characters have little to no motivation to do half of what they do (especially Clause). Whats more, their goals and what little motivations they do have are in a state of constant flux, changing from episode to episode. For instance Moran, the rifle man from the beginning of the show, decides after the opening battle to quit his job as a rifleman. This makes sense considering the dire circumstances under which we were introduced to this character. However when they make him a mechanic on the Sylivanna all he does is reminisce about the good old days when he served as a rifleman before actually going back to the job hed made such a big deal about leaving.  Why does he want to go back? What is so terrible about being a mechanic on a ship where his captain doesnt useless sacrifice his men? The people he works with are all really cool people, his commanders are descent, and theres very little danger compared to his previous job. So whats the problem, Moran?

Now lets use Clause as another example. First he wants to bring Ai to the Sylivanna, but then he wants to rescue her from it. Then he doesnt want to rescue her, he wants to keep her safe. But then its not about keeping her safe anymore, its about seeing whats in these skies or some other nonsense like that. Whats the end result of all this? Characters who have no idea what they are doing, why they are doing it, or what they wish to accomplish.  This is the main problem with the show.

Now to touch on what the show does well. The lore and backstory to Last Exile is really quite interesting. It does a really good job in creating a mystery for the viewers to try to piece together with what little info is given us. What is Exile? What does it do? Hoe does Ai play into all this? How is it that the Guild manages to hold such a stranglehold on the world? Last Exile does not reveal too much too early, which gives us the satisfaction of piecing the mystery together as we go along. But the real treats are the battle scenes. Fleets of huge floating battleships flying through the clouds as they fire their enormous cannons at one another. The battles in this series are some of the best Ive seen. If only the show had more battle scenes and less bipolar characters I might be able to justify a higher rating. I also found the tech to be extremely fun. Its a steampunk show, so you already know the general idea, but they use it in such inventive ways (such as a giant listening device that acts like a sonar).

The animation, though passible, is nothing to write home about. Its really quite dull and colorless. A lot of browns, blacks, greys, more grey, dark grey, white, greyish brown, you get the idea. A little more color might have helped to liven things up a little bit. The music as well I found underwhelming. There are times I found the music to be quite inappropriate for the scene, in fact, and in other cases it was simply too loud. Its not very often that the music actually manages to detract from the overall experience, but I found this the case for Last Exile.

So whats the final verdict? Though I can fully understand why people love this show so much, personally I didn't find it to be all that impressive.  The world was interesting, the battles were awesome, and the tech was inventive, but the most important aspect of any story, the characters, just didn't resonate with me. They were too bipolar, too wishy washy, too prone to doing dangerous things for unexplained reasons. The pacing was also quite dull; I honestly think they could have made this into a 13 episode series and it would have been the better for it. There weren't 26 episodes worth of story to tell, so it just seemed to drag at times.

Will I recommend you see it? You betcha. Its a classic anime series which I think most fans of the genra owe it to themselves to see at least once. Will I recommend that you buy it? Well for that the answer is no, especially at the inflated prices anime DVDs go for. Its a good show with many high points and positives that many people will find enjoyable.  I personally didnt, but that does not mean you will not.

3803785,4,B001US3XUK,"Two nations, Anatoray and Disith have been engaged in a war for over ten years, overseen by ""the Guild,"" a technologically advanced nation serving as referee, or so it seems.

Claus and Lavie are two vanship pilots in Anatoray, working as messengers. They are pulled aboard the ""Kill'em All"" Silvana, the most l fearsome airship in all of the world, to protect a mysterious child named Alvis. Their new mission will uncover the truth about their world.

Jhonny Yong Bosch plays Claus, using his young boy voice (Renton from Eureka 7), and Kari Wahlgren is Lavie (Haruko from FLCL). Crispin Freeman (Togusa from GitS:S.A.C.) is Alex Rowe, captain of the Silvana. And we have Tai and Izzy from Digimon, Joshua Seth and Mona Marshal, playing the tag alongs from the Guild. It's a little distracting to hear all these voices that I recognize from someplace else, but they quickly blend into their roles. Except, Izzy and Tai. Sorry, Izzy and Tai.

Overall, it's a good series with some captivating drama that I enjoyed sitting through. But there are some problems I had that prevent me from giving it a perfect score. First thing you'll notice is that the airships are CG. Not just in the action shots, every time you see a vanship, it's clearly CG even when they're parked. They don't blend the two art styles perfectly, so when they overlap, sometimes they can look awkward. It's clear they chose to animate the ships using CG to make the airship battles look better (and they succeeded), but they must have cut some corners in the animation. There's one burly mechanic who doesn't look quite right from episode to episode. The characters eyes have irises, and you can spot a few that weren't drawn right, making it look like they're looking in the wrong direction. But that might be just nitpicking.

Secondly, but most damning, the Guild are terrible villains. Boring, uninteresting, boilerplate, opulent villains. They are bad guys, because they're bad guys, and they're bad guys, because they're bad guys. They are the weakest link, in this otherwise, excellent series. All of the Good Guys, really make up for these boring bad guys. I love watching them win, more than watching those guys lose.

Thirdly, I don't like the drama in the middle of the series involving Tatiana. Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but I don't like what it implies. And I'm happy they dropped it a few episodes later. I might be straight up wrong though.

Also, there's no extras on these DVDs at all. Not even trailers. The Menu is only ""Play All"" ""Episodes"" and ""Set Up."" Weird. Most dvds usually pack some extras like clean opening and closing song, and trailers, but here there's nothing.

Even though I'm not giving it a perfect score, I did enjoy it and I do recommend it for anyone looking for some drama and airship battles. I give it 4-out-of-5 Stars.",1356134400,,2834,4.759674134419552

Story/Universe

The story is about 2 kids who make deliveries by ""van ship,"" which is similar to a speeder from Star Wars Episode 6.  It has some of the flavors from Miyazaki's Porco Rosso (the flying and air combat), some of the flavors from Castle In the Sky and Howl's Moving Castle (just the kind of gritty machinery and slightly magical way the ships are powered and such).  I also got a little bit of the Firefly and Star Trek vibe from it as well.  Don't get me wrong, the story is completely unrelated and different from all of those titles, but it's got a little bit of the flavor of all of those, wrapped up into a unique Anime experience.

Animation

The animation and art style are really great.  I really loved the concept of the flying ships, and how they do battle.  The animation is really great, and the art really gets you immersed into the fictional world.

Sound/picture/etc.

I haven't really gotten a chance to play all of them on my surround sound system, but overall I think it's good.  I may update this later after I've re-watched all of the series.

Overall

If you like steam punk, anime, high fantasy, you are really going to like this series.  The characters are really likable (I really liked the main captain of the main ship that the story is built around).  I really hope that, at some point, this is remastered and re-done on Blu-ray.  Overall, an excellent story; very much worth owning (especially for the price I got it for, ~$21.00), I highly recommend it.",1352419200,,1679,4.41042345276873

It's basically the 1950's hotrod culture. Instead of hotrods, there are Van Ships. The Van Ships are two person, anti-gravity flying machines that look like classic muscle cars.

I don't understand how anyone could give this series two stars. I'll bet they also go into a Starbucks, ask for a Caramel Apple Cider, then complain that it tastes like Caramel.  This is ANIME. It's not classic literature. It's there to entertain, and Last Exile does just that.  Each episode has plenty of action, sub-plots and intrigue. I have no idea why they chose such a lousy image for the case of the DVD - Lavie handing Claus his lunch? Idiotic.

It's been years since I last watched it and still I've never seen anything remotely close to it in terms of originality.  ""1 boy has 4 hot girls"" series are everywhere, ""Girls with guns"" aren't new, and ""Giant robot"" anime come a dime-a-dozen.

Life in this alternate reality is hard for the two main characters, who live life on the poor side of the spectrum.  However, their skills and teamwork propel them into a huge worldwide struggle for survival and independence.

This was the first series (that I watched) which incorporated 3-D work, from ""Gonzo,"" who is now a major source of 3-D effects for many series.  It's very nice work, the harmony of 2-D and 3-D was pretty much perfect.

It's a nice anime.  There's not a lot of blood at all, it's not meant to be gory.  ""Good"" language.  Not meant to follow the many anime out there that emphasize boobs on girls and stereotypical anime stuff like that.  Anyone can enjoy it.  I'm already watching season 2 and some of the characters from the first are there.  Which ones?  You'll have to buy this series first to find out  :)

If you STILL haven't seen this anime, and are looking for something fresh and different from the hundreds of anime out there, I don't think you'll regret getting this.

3803793,5,B001US3XUK,"First let me say that I am new to writing reviews so please bear with me.  I will not be giving plot synopses or list characters.  I also do not give 5 star reviews lightly.  As of now there are only a handful of series and a few more anime movies that I would give 5 stars, and I love anime.  I own a sizable anime collection (more than 300 discs and a few VHS) and have watch them all at least once.  I have also rented several other anime series.

All that said, this is one of the 4 or 5 best anime series I have seen. I keep coming back to this series over and over.  If you enjoy anime for more than the chance to see panties flash, over sized breasts bounce, noses bleed and geeks getting smothered by babes, this may be for you.  Mind you I do enjoy some of those types of shows and own several.  This however is everything that great sci-fi anime is supposed to be.  The animation, music and dub are excellent.  The main story is great and the sub plots both compelling and supportive of the main plot line.  There are many top notch characters for you to love and hate and some who make you feel both ways before the show is over.  There is more than one character who appear to be either weak, unfeeling or even evil who redeems his/herself in the end.  I will warn you that everyone you may come to care about reach the end safely, but that's true of most good sci-fi.  While there's no real fan service, some mild language and sci-fi violence may make it inappropriate for young children.

Using the same voice actors over and over again in English dubs makes anime seem more one-dimensional...and even if these aren't the same actors as in other series, they speak in a similar way.

The plot is overly complicated when it doesn't need to be and war/death/violence/shelling can stop for minutes at a time when characters need to speak without interruption.  The war itself has no real logic or purpose to it that is developed; it's simply there to add tension and drama.  The over-reliance and repetition of the word ""chivalry"" grows stale after the first episode...which is fine, because it stops being a plot point after the first episode.

3803801,4,B001US3XUK,"I discovered this series on Netflix and after watching it there I really wanted the DVD's. I don't do this for many animes but I really enjoyed this one. I'm not sure what one reviewer is talking about when he says that the aerial combat makes no sense. If you keep in mind that this is basically old sailing/steam ship tactics with similar weapons used aerially, the battle sequences make perfect sense. It's the old chivalric code style of battle which makes no sense to our modern minds but is historically accurate. Granted, some of the vanship maneuvers are not quite right, such as the Immelman turn, which is a half loop with a half roll at the top, but I can forgive that since most folks wouldn't know that anyway. Half the time the Immelman turn is incorrectly shown as a Hammerhead stall or stall turn.
I found the story entertaining and engaging and the character development adequate. I do agree with one reviewer that the ending seemed a bit rushed and there are still some loose ends when all is said and done. but overall, I recommend this anime.

3803802,2,B001US3XUK,"I would like to preface this review by noting that I greatly enjoy watching anime.  There's something wonderfully unique about its combination of stylized animation, teen-to-adult thematic content, character-driven action, and unorthodox world-creation that I have found compelling for over a decade of my life.  I have already watched the bulk of mainstream animes, series like Dragon Ball Z and Bleach and Neon Genesis Evangelion, in addition to some less popular titles, and was looking for something else to sink my teeth into--possibly something more mature or more artfully constructed.  Weighing in at four-and-a-half stars on amazon, Last Exile seemed like an appealing choice: reviewers have praised it for its subtlety, its pacing, and its rich quasi-steam punk aesthetic.

In retrospect, I'm totally baffled by their reactions.  This show is sub-par at best.

One of my major issues with the series was its lack of quality animation or memorable action sequences.  To be sure, the art itself is actually quite good, but it's also incredibly sparse.  There are barely any movements on the part of drawn characters or objects, and the show includes only one single fight sequence that isn't almost 100% computer generated.  You might think it would be axiomatic that an anime should contain some robust animation, but Last Exile never delivers on this count.  The CG ship-based combat is alright, but hardly qualifies as impressive, and these sequences are seriously hindered by a lack of coherent battle mechanics.  What I mean by this is that, when writers create some kind of unusual military situation--in this case, air combat with vanships and larger flying warships--there needs to be a real logic to the way the fighting works, or there can be no meaningful dramatic tension.  The novels Mistborn and, to a lesser extent, Ender's Game, are outstanding examples of this principle: they both introduced novel combat situations that were otherworldly, but still had clearly defined limits and properties that drove the action forward.  The same cannot be said for Last Exile, in which sky vehicles whirr around unpredictably, executing new moves or forgetting about weapons or redefining rules as they go.

Of course, art and action are not totally essential elements--their mediocrity could be forgiven if the storyline of the series was clever or deep or immersive enough to compensate.  It is not.  Instead, the plot of Last Exile feels consistently disjointed and poorly-thought-out.  In an early episode, for example, several of the protagonists angrily denounce chivalry in a seemingly revolutionary moment; but then, for the remainder of the series, chivalry is rarely mentioned and never seems to have any serious impact on the narrative, or even on the culture of their world.  In another exemplary case, multiple female characters express romantic interest in the (early- to mid-pubescent?) main character, Claus, but their feelings are never resolved or even acknowledged later on.  And major questions, like ""What exactly is the Grand Stream that the main characters want to navigate?"" or ""Where did 'The Guild' get its power from to begin with?"" or ""What caused the changing weather patterns that are threatening to destroy the planet?"" remain permanently unanswered.  To me, though, the low point of the series' storyline was the final episode, when I realized that the incredibly-unresolved plot was about to wrap itself up--going straight from the middle of a climactic battle to a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion--in the span of about ten minutes.

Last Exile isn't totally devoid of narrative coherency or closure.  But it's close.

In the final analysis, I'm left wondering just why it is that so many people think so highly of this show.  Absent good animation or a solid plot, it's just not clear what I'm supposed to be enjoying about Last Exile.  The characters lack passion and complexity (although I did enjoy Lord Dio's antics), and the world itself doesn't feel especially fleshed-out (What do ordinary people do here, anyway?  What do they create or sell?  What are their values, their myths, their pleasures, their conflicts?).  If you're looking for a good anime, there's a long list of them that you need to experience before you even start thinking about this title: watch Death Note, watch Cowboy Beebop, watch Escaflowne or Outlaw Star or Fullmetal Alchemist.

The story had a very nice start and all the characters were enjoyable. In these adult years of our lives, we rarely live out our dreams, but Claus and Lavie definitely enjoy doing courier missions. Claus can be stubborn, but he always tries to help people, the best he can. Also, I actually liked how the lip syncing was right. Now, let me get this straight, the first time I saw this show was on Netflix and I enjoyed it there, but there was a big problem, which was the fact that the audio did not match what I was seeing. That kind of was a bad impression on me, but thankfully, the dub was not like this on the DVD release. Many anime also seem to only have character movement, but I saw birds flying around and even the waves of strong wind move, not something that is encountered a lot in Japanese animation. The start of the story was interesting, the DVD had better audio timing than the Netflix stream, and the movement of the wind could be seen.

I cannot say that there is a whole lot I dislike, but one thing in particular did stand out as a bit annoying. That particular item is something than comes between the episodes. No, it is not the little things for commerical interruptions, which happen during the episodes. This problem occurs after every few episodes and that is the picture of a girl sitting somewhere and a thing that says, ""See You on the Next Flight."" This appears on every episode that is divisible by four on the first three discs and every three episodes on the last disc, of the four disc set. Okay, this makes sense for the old individual sets from Pioneer (now Geneon), but there are 6-7 episodes on every disc of this set. This makes absolutely no sense as the end of the DVD has not been reached on any disc, with the exception of the third disc, which contains episode 20. It's like they just took all the individual DVDs and combined them into four without doing work on anything, but making sure that audio was good. Doing this kind of thing makes people think that the end of the DVD has been reached, when it has not. However, this does not take down the quality of the show in my book, just the DVD release of it. There should not be anything that suggest the end of the DVD before the final episode of the disc.

Despite the fact that it makes a person think the end of the DVD has been reached, watching this series on DVD was definitely much better than watching it on Netflix. I would recommend people try this series out. It is not for everyone, but if you like to fly, you will enjoy it more.",1311552000,13,2976,4.320214669051879
3803807,4,B001US3XUK,"Love it, or hate it. This show has a quite large fan following and there has even been a second series done.

This is not the complete series. The complete series would include the new Silver Wing episodes which just finished airing in Japan. Both have their good parts and bad. The original show sets the stage for everything, from story to the world itself.

The story is not just a simple same old tried and true story. It has many branching arcs and some very tense moments with characters. The only downside of it is they try to cram too much into this series. The episodes in the second half can get a bit packed. There is also some problems with the film making when scenes seem to be cut for commercials at odd points. Perhaps this is a problem with the English version.

The dub itself isn't super. You'll want to watch this in Japanese for full effect. Characters are much deeper in the native language than in English. They add to a very rich world design with a lot of grand ideas. But it won't be for everyone. Some are going to find things confusing. Especially in the second half of the show.

This may be the only real downside for Exile is the weakness in the second half. So much coming together at once and events happening quicker just make it seem that the story is coming off the rails. It needed more episodes to really expand smoother.

Those curious about the second series, I'll give you a brief glimpse. It takes place on Earth, instead of this other world. The characters are changed with an emphasis on a mostly all female cast. The story itself is slightly better in some ways than the original. Large warship battles happen more often. But if you've seen other all female heroine anime, you know the flow of it. There are constant attempts to lay down arms and just attain peace. The strength of Silver Wing seems to wain by the end as it descends into predictability by the female cast. Really, it gets very distracting switching between dark undertones and love everyone speeches which seem to do nothing. But despite that, it is still worth a watch if only to see more of the Exile universe from a different angle.

Be sure to see this series first because there are some character crossover in Silver Wing and you will appreciate it more if you know the characters from the original Last Exile.

Personally, there are things I like with Exile and things I find so-so. If you are on the edge, I recommend a rental or maybe view some episodes online. Its decent enough for that.",1308787200,,2511,4.46943231441048
3803808,5,B001US3XUK,"Last Exile is one of those series that is very hard to rate. To my mind, this is one of the best steam punk series around, though I do have a few issues with some of the plot development.

Range Murata's (Blue Submarine 6) art and character designs are fantastic (if you haven't seen his work, do look for some of his art books) and present a visually stunning setting. Everything from clothing, to ships, to towns, cities, mountains and clouds are visually compelling.

The characters are all memorable from the Silvana's maintenance crew all the way up the Alex the enigmatic and vindictive captain. Klaus and Lavi make for a wonderful duo as Klaus' kind, even-keel nature mixes well with Lavi's rambunctious spunk and insecurity. And Tatiana Wisla may be one of my favorite anime characters ever (be still my heart!). There are too many to list, and each comes across as more than the sum of their 2D parts.

Honestly, the only gripes that I have with the series are that (1) Dio's arc is woefully unsatisfactory given the dramatic way it is built up and developed and (2) the wrap up of the story is just a little too fast. There are so many complex and interesting subplots that this was, to some extent, inevitable. But, that doesn't change the fact of it.

Those caveats aside, this series is a must (what ever form you view it in...I am not good at technical comparisons) for any anime or steam punk fan, and honestly would be enjoyable for just about any viewer.",1308441600,31,1471,4.5606060606060606

Some people may find that frustrating, but I really enjoyed how everything- the characters, the places, even the structure of the world itself- were all treated as part of the story and the experience, not just facts to be rattled off or simplified to be easily understood.  There is more to everything in this anime then meets the eye, some of which is explained as the story goes on, some of which is not.  Piecing things together as the series went on was a large part of the fun of this show.  Very notably, I was satisfied with the ending, something that I can rarely say about an anime series.  It was fulfilling, but not tell-all.

As for characters, there's Steve Blum (Spike Spiegel), Beau Billingslea (Jet), and Skip Stellrecht (Vicious). In fact, the Blum and Stellrecht's characters coincidentally share a little rivalry in the plot. Kinda like in Cowboy Bebop...hint, hint).

Overall, great storyline, action, and characters. The dialogue is not complex but simple enough to emit the strong emotions and points across. Everything is also progressively revealed, so there's a bit of mystery.",1301616000,,824,5.4296875

The storyline doesn't really make much sense, seems forced, is poorly explained at best, and does not flow logically.  The computer generated graphics look very impressive as far as the models of the aircraft go, but the movements of the models are jerking and unrealistic.  Semi-important details are inconsistent, for example the characters refer to their aircraft needing acceleration to take off, but than you see the same aircraft hovering in place (might be a small detail, but lazy as far as the writers go).  Several of the characters (and there are many) are not fleshed out very well and seem mostly to be there just to fill time.  The show ends in a sudden and bizarre way that is only loosely related to the actual plot.  It seems the creators of the show tried to carry it on graphics and computer animation alone, but even that was not executed very well.  I have seen far worse anime, but than I have seen much much better too.  For anyone looking for a really good series, I do not recommend Last Exile.",1297382400,2,1098,4.623711340206185
3803823,5,B001US3XUK,"Ignore the negative reviews that say this series is too slow, too long or too cliched ""Japanese style"". They seem to either forget or be unaware that the majority of Anime, including this one, is NOT written by westerners for westerners but rather it is written by Japanese authors for Japanese audiences and thus is based on their own cultural concepts and mythos. For obvious reasons, those are going to be quite different from our own.

We are fortunate that there are companies that strive to translate these wonderful works into English and bring them to western audiences otherwise we'd never have the opportunity to enjoy so many excellent series.  It also gives you a glimpse of a different cultural point of view, especially when dealing with concepts of honor and self-sacrifice.

Last Exile is a fantastic and sometimes subtle series in terms of artistic execution as well as character and plot development, all of which is subtly amplified by a wonderful musical score.

Do some research and you'll find out that this series contains a powerful story, riveting music, and beautiful art that is true to Gonzo's style. But the beauty of this product is not even the series itself, but instead the fantastic way in which Funimation has displayed it. I was really unsure about what would happen to a lot of good series after the collapse of Geneon, but obviously I had nothing to worry about. The collection comes with two slim-pack DVD's with two discs per case, each displaying amazing concept art as well as detailing the episodes in a creative way which complements the series. This series--and even the packaging--completely blows me away. Definitely a fantastic collection and great buy. Keep up the good work, Funimation!",1294012800,2,844,4.787671232876712
3803825,5,B001US3XUK,"Gonzo created this series for their 10th anniversary.  It is set in the future, on a distant planet (not really a spoiler - but knowing such makes the series make a LOT more sense).  In it, folks pilot vanships to deliver messages around the globe.  The Anatoray are the folks we follow.  They are at war with the Disith.  But we see early on that the conflict is being instigated and managed by The Guild.  And The Guild features my favorite group of megalomaniac villains in all anime history.  Delphine is just ROTTEN!

Claus and Lavi are lifelong friends, they end up chancing upon a mysterious youth during a message run.  Against better judgement, they save the girl, Alvis and end up in a fight for their lives.  Turns out that saving Alvis was the right thing to do.  Of course now everyone is after them.  They end up getting kidnapped by pirates on board the Silvna battleship.  And so the story goes onward towards periodic confrontations with the Silvana, the Anatoray, the Disith, and The Guild.

I really enjoyed the semi-steam-punk style of this series.  It bears a bit in common with northern Europe from World War One and up to the early WW2 years.  There is also a high emphasis on air travel instead of land travel.  The reason being the terrain and remoteness of settlements.

There is a great bit of mystery in the series as well.  Who are the Disith?  What is in the Grand Stream?  What's on the other side of the Grand Stream?  What happened to Claus and Lavi's dads?  What is up with Dio (crazy fool)?  Could Alex Roh really be a cucumber?  (since he's always as cool as a... get it?).

This is a lot of anime fun for the price.  It isn't as complex as, say, Ergo Proxy; nor is it as up front enjoyable and deep as Fullmetal Alchemist (which had twice the episodes).  Instead it is a solid, moving, and riveting anime series with a deep story, interesting characters, and lots of action and suspense.  It crosses the lines of styles, so it is tough to put it into one category.

Recommended for fans of Eureka Seven, Fullmetal Alchemist, Shangri-La, Final Fantasy (though this is way better), and pretty much any steam punk or retro future anime series.  Well worth the modest asking price in my humble opinion.",1292025600,,2235,4.526315789473684
3803826,3,B001US3XUK,"The Review:
For reasons(rant) below, I found Last Exile series to be interesting, yet less enjoyable than I had hoped. Regardless, I really loved the unique blend of ideas, fluid animation and personable characters of the series. It's kind of a Steamboy meets Castles in the Sky tale. I even enjoyed the progression of the episodes, up until the last few, when the narrative became hard to follow and cliche in parts.

The Rant:
I've seen my fair share of anime over the years and have noticed two continual themes in many of the shows. First, that preserving honor takes presidence over all else, usually leading to needless acts of death or sacrifice. Second, at the heart of every plot, most of the characters have a severe lack of communication.(Or is it excessive politeness?) This in turn amplifies the problem until it can only be resolved through ""honorable"" acts of death or sacrifice. It is these overused plot devices that drive me crazy, making the story feel less believable and sincere, even if it adds conflict and furthers the plot along.",1286236800,2,1054,4.823204419889502

The characters are surprisingly deep - yes, I will agree with some of the reviewers that the English voice actors for a few characters seem slightly off (I did not expect several people to sound as they did), but this does not affect their stories much - and the action scenes are very well done.  The music is good - the intro song is strangely catchy, and the episode ending music is great - and I personally liked the art style very much.  It seems almost minimalistic, but after watching a few episodes over again, you realize how much depth the background really contains.

Overall, I highly recommend this series.  The plot is interesting, the design is fantastic, and the characters are engaging.",1281312000,,862,4.535483870967742
3803830,4,B001US3XUK,"This anime is beautiful to look at. That is the first thing I will say about it because I'm sure that that is the first thing you will notice about it, and is what will probably keep you watching for the first half.

Last Exile is a story about two orphans, Claus and Lavie, who make a living as couriers. In the land they live in, people move around in the sky more than they do water or land, and the two fly an aircraft known as a vanship. All is normal in their lives until one day, during a vanship race in their home town (think star wars), a foreign vanship cuts off their path and crashes into the forest below. Claus, the pilot, decides that they should go down to make sure the people in the vanship were all right. When they get there they see that the pilot has been shot, but is still alive, and there is a dead person in the back seat holding a small sleeping girl. The pilot tells them that an enemy faction, The Guild, is after this young girl and asks the two to see his mission through to the end and escort the girl to safety. The Guild is an advanced race of people who have superior technology and almost silently rule the people below them. Of course the pair accept the mission and take the girl. This leads the two to eventually come on board a ship called the Silvana and on that ship, they will face wars with others and ultimately battle The Guild's control over them by attempting to prevent their awakening of a powerful and unknown entity known as `exile'.

The first half of this anime bored me to tears. I'd heard so many rave reviews I couldn't believe that it could possibly be as bad as I initially perceived it to be... so forced myself to watch episode after episode. The beginning is king of pointless and disorienting. We see Claus and Lavie living life as usual, doing a mission or two, fighting in a race, but there was nothing that really drew me into the plot or care about the characters until around the twelfth episode. The story up until that point was kind of like the middle of an anime... boring and just filling up space. And at that point the audience doesn't have enough emotional history with the characters to care. I was so bored I spent more of the time picking out character flaws. Lavie is completely useless for most of the series. This is actually stated in the show by one of the other characters. For a majority of the first half of the show all she does is whine and yell. She continues to do this in the second half, but not as much because she is not in as many episodes. I felt that they could have done so much more with her character, there was so much potential there.

The show was not all bad though. As I said, the second half was much better than the first and I would say that the ending makes up for the pain of having the watch the build up. The flashbacks helped, as did the actual purpose given to the character's existence. The war inspired many emotional and political problems for the characters, and the characters were a defined a little bit better for the viewer. The Guild reminded me of the blue giants in the animated film Fantastic Planet, for those who have seen the film, both in how they acted and how they treated the people. The end of the anime was the very best part for me.  I don't know why exactly, but as I watched Claus and Lavie flying over that field with Claus' overtone and the music in the background, I got this nostalgic sort of feeling. Kind of like the feeling I get after watching a Miazaki film, a feeling of endless possibility... but I have no idea how as I don't think I liked the show that much to have developed such feelings about it's final moments. But it is as it is I suppose.

The animation in this anime is absolutely stunning. It is one of the most beautiful animes I've seen artistically speaking. In regards to the scenery anyway. One of the funny things about this anime is that even though the landscape is so well drawn.. for some reason the characters can look very amateurishly drawn at times. There will be a stunning scene with some sort of aircraft or landscape or room and is so amazing that it will have you sighing in awe, but two seconds later there will be a scene with one of the characters positioned awkwardly or drawn with an arm or leg too skinny. Just in general I feel that the artists put so much effort into the world the story takes place in that they sort of just drew the characters in last-minute like `oh ya this story actually revolves around people... we should draw some'. Claus and Lavie we see the most of because the show is about them, and Claus I'm fine with, I feel that his look suits the artwork surrounding him. Lavie, on the other hand, I do not like one bit. There is so little detail in her features that her face is literally a circle with huge `anime eyes' and a big mouth. While the other characters are drawn seriously, like the characters of a drama, Lavie is drawn like the heroine of a high school romantic comedy... you expect her to go chibi any second. And since this is not a romantic comedy, and Lavie does not even serve as a comic relief in this story, her look is completely out of place and always takes me out of the whimsical mood the scenery has so beautifully created for me. Most of the other characters could also be drawn better, but Lavie is where they so obviously slacked or guessed wrong... I'm not sure which. And her haircut doesn't help.

I have mixed feelings about the anime, but for each negative point I have, there is a positive one to combat it. Overall I would say that it is indeed worth the watch, and you will probably enjoy it immensely at some point. The question is how much are you willing to put up with to find what you might intensely like?",1280534400,,5756,4.290708371665134
3803831,5,B001US3XUK,"Imagine a world divided into two warring nations, full of airborne warships, political tangles, and a mysterious riddle that will decide all their fates.

""Last Exile: The Complete Series"" is full of all these things, filled with glorious CGI, likable characters and some truly brilliant plot twists near the end. The plot becomes kind of knotted up in the last lap of the series, but it's still a beautifully rendered story about love, friendship and occasionally revenge -- and it's rendered in such beautiful animation that it simply sweeps you away.

Vanship pilot Claus Valca and his buddy Lavie Head are in the middle of a race when they encounter a mystery pilot being chased by a Guild star-ship. His cargo: a little girl named Alvis.

Unfortunately, getting Alvis safely to the rendezvous is no easy task -- especially when the ship picking her up turns out to be the legendary, deadly Silvana. But Claus and Lavie don't want their new friend to be alone and frightened, so they manage to make their way onto the Silvana, and end up becoming part of its crew. Of course, the head vanship pilot Tatiana Wisla isn't too happy about that.

And life aboard the Silvana is anything but boring for the two teenagers. Claus and Lavie take part in a vast vanship race, a battle with the overblown Goliath, a rebellion against the Emperor, and a crash landing in the middle of the desert. And Claus has caught the interest of the whimsical Dio of the Guild -- the younger brother of the cold-hearted, calculating Delphine.

What's more, the Silvana's journey is somehow wrapped up in the mysteries of the Grand Stream, a search for revenge by the Silvana's captain, the secrets of the Mysteria, and the very future of their world. What is Exile, and where will it lead?

""Last Exile"" is one of those series that blurs the lines of genre and style -- it feels like a more ethereal brand of steampunk, complete with Victorian trappings and advanced airships. It's full of glowing light, vast expanses of cloads and flowing cities, and beautiful mountainous landscapes and clouds that could have come straight from a Hayao Miyazaki movie. Not to mention some brilliant airborne battles.

The many subplots of the series unspool gradually throughout each episode, twining together as the plot goes on -- such as Alex's vendetta, the plans of the villain Delphine, and the mysterious Grand Stream that seems to be central to the mysteries of Prester. The dialogue is rather run-of-the-mill, but the carefully-drawn world (complete with water shortages and a fictional fuel called ""claudia"") make up for that, as well as the tangled political clashes that stretch from one episode to the next.

The last few episodes are a bit of a mindbender. The plot becomes a bit tangled up, before twisting into a startling revelation about the world of Prester -- which admittedly, while carefully foreshadowed, is quite a surprise when it's revealed.

Claus and Lavie make a likable pair of protagonists -- he's mellow, sweet and rather laid-back, while she's fiery and easily upset (""This is OUR vanship, and YOU can't touch it!""), so they end up playing well off each other. And the supporting cast is a pretty solid one, with a ride range of personalities and plenty of likable minor characters (like the mechanics). Among the standouts: the melancholy and mysterious Alex Rowe, Alvis, the whimsical and tragic Dio, and vanship pilot Tatiana (who develops a crush on Claus).

""Last Exile: The Complete Series"" has a few odd twists, but it's a solid and atmospheric anime series that glides slowly to a rather startling conclusion.",1279411200,3,3617,4.885807504078303
3803832,5,B001US3XUK,"Last Exile is a fun anime series, and though it might not have a high re-watch value, its extremely enjoyable while it lasts.

Studio Gonzo has made some of my favorite anime, and Last Exile proves the studio is capable of making movie-quality material. Everything from the music to the special effects is crafted neatly, and as a result the series shines on many occasions.

Story: 9/10
-The story isn't perfect, and some of it isn't new, but its still quite epic and at times very touching. The pacing is great and each episode does a good job at establishing characters and moving along the plot. I won't tell what the story is about because surprise works well with this series.

Characters: 10/10
-The main 2 characters are good people, but I found myself falling in love with everyone else. Especially the bad guys. In Last Exile and enemy is The Guild, a large group of people that resemble a mix of government and religion. (Some might view this as controversial, but its not too edgy). Anyways, I liked the Guild best, especially the two main bad guys Luciolla and Dio (weird names). They're sexy, stylish and mysterious, but they're human in the sense that they have feelings and come to realize consequences.

In fact, every character in the series is well-rounded and awfully realistic. Perhaps this category is where the show truly shines.

Art: 9/10
-I've seen better, but its still good. The quality of animation hardly changes, which is a very good thing. Some might describe this type of animation as ""steampunk"".

Music: 9/10
-Fun, and it does it's job at creating tension when needed. The opening song might be one of the best I've heard.

English Dub: 7/10
-This might be the worst part of the show. For the most part everyone does a good job. But then some characters simply begin to grate on your ears over time, especially the main girl character, Lavie. She's loud, screams and cries often, and is just not fun to listen to. Still, the dub is good for the most part. I love Lord Dio's voice!

Overall: 9/10
-A great entry from Studio Gonzo, Last Exile tells a memorable story with plenty of twists and turns, intriguing characters, and exciting action sequences; the perfect anime series for that lazy afternoon. Its fun while it lasts, but some might not care to watch it again and again. Still, I loved it and am glad to own it.

Rating: TV-14
-Accurate rating. Its basically PG-13. There is some swearing, and violence tends to be bloody. There is also some brief nudity, including mild fan-service (focus on the female breasts) and one scene where a guild member is bathing. She splashes water in the air, and the camera zooms out, but the water is preventing us from seeing much. Also, some of the characters are gay.

3803834,5,B001US3XUK,"There's not a lot we all want to watch together, middle aged and elementary schoolers at the same time.

This fit the bill, however. Partly because the middle aged folks are anime fans, sure, but partly because Last Exile is a heck of a lot better imagined, written, directed, and produced than most anime available in English.

Some of the dub was stilted - probably due as much to the conventions of anime writing and direction as to the voice talent. I liked watching it in Japanese, as well, but not everyone likes subtitles.

The story's pace is good, with a good balance of action, drama, dialogue, tasty visuals, etc. The characters are rendered as 2-d, with 3-d CG animated mecha (don't worry - no giant robots in this one, if you're tired of them). The animation failed to impress me at a half dozen spots in the movie, but the overall quality was really high.

The slim dvd case is pretty easy to use, but the pins are delicate, so don't bend it. Pretty case art and kind of a cool package design overall add to the fun.

The adult themes are so light here my very young child had no problems, and neither did we. There are a few kisses, and there is a little blood, but people aren't shot onscreen.

The only things I can think of that might bother some people are an effeminate male character (but in context, our cultural cues are all wrong) and the creepy behavior of the villain. It doesn't last long, and everyone watching knows who the villain is.

You might find yourself with true feelings towards each and every one, from distaste to perhaps hatred for those of the Guild, to parental encouragement for Claus and Lavie.  In my opinion, it is everything you could wish for in a television series, be it anime or live action.",1270598400,2,597,4.813725490196078

3803837,4,B001US3XUK,"Anything with the name Range Murata attached to it is an instant lure for me.  One of the most talented people working in the world of Japanese manga, his art-magazine series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robot/dp/1897376758/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robot</a>&nbsp;is always full of the most stunning and unique images.  His work in anime is rare and always worth checking out.

""Last Exile"" reunites Range Murata with the four-episode OVA&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Submarine-No-6/dp/B000NVT0PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Submarine, No. 6</a>&nbsp;team of Studio Gonzo and director Koichi Chigira (Brave Story).  ""Blue Submarine No. 6"" was hailed as Japan's first ""CG Anime"" although more truthfully it blended both 3-D computer graphics with traditional technology.  Whereas ""Blue Submarine No. 6"" was adapted from a 1967 manga series by Satoru Ozawa, ""Last Exile"" is an original story created as a celebration of Studio Gonzo's tenth anniversary.

The world of Prester sits in the Golden Age of Aviation, where swift two-seater Vanships flit their way in and out of the spaces left between the mighty flying battleships that pound each other with cannon broadsides.  The two nations Anatoray and Disith face off in eternal conflict obeying rules of chivalrous combat laid down and enforced by the technologically advanced Guild.

Two vanship couriers, Lavie Head and Claus Valca, get caught up in this world when they accept the job to deliver a message to Duke Mad-thane of Anatoray's military.  Escaping from the battle, the two discover a small child named Alvis E. Hamilton who they take charge of.  Alivis is being hunted by everyone, and so the three are forced to take refuge in the undefeated rouge vessel of outlaw Alex Row. Row himself is a mystery, at first appearing to be little more than a successful pirate but soon revealed to be tracking down the rumored four Mysteria where are said to be keys to the greater mystery of something known only as Exile.

It took me awhile to get into ""Last Exile.""  The first several episodes are pure set-up, leading us into the world of Prester, of vanships and air battles.  The focus is heavily on Claus and Lavie, touching little on the politics that will later come to dominate the series.  It is not until the third episode, when Alvis E. Hamilton makes her appearance, that the story starts to deepen, and several more episodes while I was fully hooked. The first mention of the ""Exile"" that the series takes its name from does not even appear until around episode ten, well into the second disk in the series.

From the box cover and synopsis, I was expecting something along the lines of Miyazaki's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-in-the-Sky/dp/B002ZTQVHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle in the Sky</a>, but instead I got an updated world of Matsumoto Leiji's dramatic space opera universe of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Harlock/dp/B000059HAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Harlock</a>.  This is not a bad thing, as I love political space opera, but ""Last Exile"" is definitely not the light and fluffy series I was expecting.

Like ""Blue Submarine No. 6,"" ""Last Exile"" merges computer animated 3D with traditional 2D animation.  This also reminded me of Matsumoto Leiji, who uses a similar tactic of 3D animation for his ships and 2D for his characters.  I always find this combination jarring unless it is down flawlessly, and it is not flawless here.  But fortunately this style settles down after the first few episodes.

Aside from the slow start, once ""Last Exile"" gets going it is a fantastic series.  Range Murata's unique designs are brought to life beautifully, and it is clear that he spent quite a bit of time on the detail of each character.  Some of the Steam Punk influences are incredible, like the musketeers lining the deck of the flying battleships and using steam-powered muskets while fighting and dying in strict formation.  The vanships themselves take a bit of getting used to, as no such vehicle could every truly fly, but their speed and sleekness soon takes over any awkwardness of design.

Funimation's collection of ""Last Exile"" is perfect, with the entire twenty-six episode series put on four disks packed in two slimline cases.  This release is not part of their Viridian Collection, but offers the same value for an affordable price.",1267401600,3,4543,5.566860465116279

Animes with a truly satisfying ending are few and far between. Fortunately, Last Exile broke out of the mediocre ending mold.

The epilogue aside, this anime had a refreshing focus on character development - these were characters in which you could actually get attached to and had realistic reactions to events in the series. The voices (not talking about dubbed) fit their personality and each added an interesting perspective to the series.

Many series recently have focused primarily on action and explosions with little emphasis on plot...this trend did not stem from Last Exile. While there is action and battle scenes, there is a focus on plot and mystique which is enough to keep the viewer interested all the way through the whole series. Best of all...there are no filler episodes.

I would say that if you have no interest in the series by episode 5, then it's not an anime for you...but most people are hooked before 5.

 Visually this is a thing of beauty because of the CGI, the animation itself is well done. Yet it is the blend of the two that makes it stand out in my mind. The story line moves ahead at a good pace and you get so many very well developed characters. Take for instance Dio, whom was my favorite sub character, although he did not have the biggest part he added so much more to the story.
 This story is about a teenage boy and girl who have lost everything except each other and their Van Ship. They start out as air delivery messengers and are happy with that then they deliver a message that brings them into the problems of war. From that point on you are meeting new characters that bring new problems.

3803850,4,B001US3XUK,"Last Exile is one of those anime series that's been floating around for a few years now that I repeatedly made mental notes of considering while shopping.  With commercials and trailers that hinted to some kind of early-avionics days adventure, it looked interesting enough but always seemed to get passed by for some flashy-boxed mecha OVA or gritty, modern-day set series.  Now that Funimation has picked up the Geneon property in its entirety, my days of putting off Last Exile have finally come to an end and let me just start by saying I should not have wasted so much time getting into this anime gem.  But before I get too far ahead of myself, let's take a moment to discuss the packaging and physical presentation.

Last Exile the Complete Series consists of 26 episodes across 4 discs and comes packaged in a stylish cardboard slipcase containing a pair of thin packs.  The artwork is stunningly appropriate, with a purposely-weathered look that includes the yellowing of the parchment and near-black & white quality to the portraits.  Faded images of the pilots, decked out in their antiquated flight gear, standing proudly before their weathered open-cockpit aircraft have a look about them that just nails the look and feel of the early 1900s.

Coming in at a total runtime of 625 minutes, Last Exile wears a very conservative TV14 rating.  This is nearly general audience material with a slight hint of adult undertones (war and aerial combat) but the show contains no real violence, suggestive content, or foul language worth parental concern.  Like real wars, some characters (even beloved by the end) do lose their lives to the cause.  However, Last Exile is never graphic in its portrayal of death nor does it glorify themes of violence.

Language options are solid with the original Japanese dialog perfectly preserved (English subtitle option) and an English dub that can truly be called worthy of the incredible scope presented within.

Last Exile is the product of the revered Gonzo Studios and made its broadcast debut over Japanese airwaves back in 2003.  I mentioned earlier that the artwork (and show itself) go a long way to accurately portray what we consider the early days of humanity's aviation experience (think barnstormers from The Golden Age (1918-1939)), however the events presented take place entirely in a fictitious world called Prester and while the culture habiting this world appears nearly identical to that of our own early 1900s, there is more to the story than what initially appears.

The planet's surface-dwellers are basically divided into two factions:  The Anatoray and the Disith.  The Anatoray most closely resemble our definition of modern society (so much so in fact that our main two protagonists happen to be members of this group) while the Disith, though similar, are a bit more primitive in nature (think fighting with spears and shields).

However the two feuding nations quickly discover that they share a common bigger threat in the form of the vastly technologically superior elf-like alien race orbiting the planet known as the Guild.  Separating the aliens' massive battleships from the people living below is a patch of never-ending nasty weather called the Grand Stream.  I should also mention that it is this violent storm that keeps the surface-dwellers living in perpetual darkness with the minimal of natural resources (including clean water).

The core of the story is told from the perspective of a pair of orphaned teenagers who make a living as courriers from the cockpit of their deceased fathers' beat-up vanship (this would be the equivalent to our old biplanes).  However gasoline engines and massive wings to create lift are foregone in this world in favor of a concept called the Claudia engine, which somehow operates on a system of pressurized blue-glowing fluid.

The story really picks up when our appropriately likable duo (Claus and Lavi) end up taking on a mission to deliver a little girl named Alvis to the captain of a warship called the Silvana.

Fans of my reviews may have noticed that I strive to not give away too much of the plot in my critiques because, after all, if you already know the entire story, what's the purpose of bothering with the show?  Instead I like to draw comparisons to other works to establish a sense of what makes the series worth viewing.  That said, Last Exile could best be described as a blend of Star Wars, a Tom Clancy novel, and maybe even a slight touch of cultural intricacy found in Star Trek.  Now I realize that sounds like a lot of space-movie comparisons but make no mistake, Last Exile borrows only from the better traits of these titles.  There are moments of vanship racing that really ring of the pod race sequence in Episode One, The Phantom Menace.  There is no shortage of military strategizing on an absolute grand (and quite flawless) scope throughout.  There's a bit of romance and comedy spread across an absolutely massive cast that is surprisingly easy to keep separate.

Pacing is just spectacular once you establish the slightly slow-going rhythm of the first few episodes.  However the show's greatest strength lies in its presentation:  Subtleties such as lighting and sounds are consistent and often subliminally establish mood more effectively than many big-budget Hollywood feature films.

Gonzo's reputation as being one of the premiere anime studios comes through in this work in the form of flawless shifting of scale throughout the story arc.  In other words, the story starts out a small, personal tale of a pair of children struggling to find their place in the world, expands to portray an unthinkably massive war for survival between a planet and its invaders, then tightens to become a personal affair in the end.  There is an air of confidence in Gonzo's pacing and presentation that simply invites viewers to let go and trust in their ability to tell their tale and in this case, that faith pays dividends.

Last Exile is a simply stunning anime work that starts to reveal its charm visually but continues to dazzle by doing nearly everything right; pacing, scope, sound work, story depth, science integration, nail biting action, lovable cast, it's all here and done to perfection as only a seasoned studio like Gonzo could pull off.

This is must-see anime in the purest sense of the concept and kudos to Funimation for refusing to allow such a well-constructed title to slip through the cracks.",1241913600,73,6463,4.961966604823748
3803851,4,B001US3XUK,"Imagine a world divided into two warring nations, full of airborne warships, political tangles, and a mysterious riddle that will decide all their fates.

""Last Exile: The Complete Series"" is full of all these things, filled with glorious CGI, likable characters and some truly brilliant plot twists near the end. The plot becomes kind of knotted up in the last lap of the series, but it's still a beautifully rendered story about love, friendship and occasionally revenge -- and it's rendered in such beautiful animation that it simply sweeps you away.

Vanship pilot Claus Valca and his buddy Lavie Head are in the middle of a race when they encounter a mystery pilot being chased by a Guild star-ship. His cargo: a little girl named Alvis.

Unfortunately, getting Alvis safely to the rendezvous is no easy task -- especially when the ship picking her up turns out to be the legendary, deadly Silvana. But Claus and Lavie don't want their new friend to be alone and frightened, so they manage to make their way onto the Silvana, and end up becoming part of its crew. Of course, the head vanship pilot Tatiana Wisla isn't too happy about that.

And life aboard the Silvana is anything but boring for the two teenagers. Claus and Lavie take part in a vast vanship race, a battle with the overblown Goliath, a rebellion against the Emperor, and a crash landing in the middle of the desert. And Claus has caught the interest of the whimsical Dio of the Guild -- the younger brother of the cold-hearted, calculating Delphine.

What's more, the Silvana's journey is somehow wrapped up in the mysteries of the Grand Stream, a search for revenge by the Silvana's captain, the secrets of the Mysteria, and the very future of their world. What is Exile, and where will it lead?

""Last Exile"" is one of those series that blurs the lines of genre and style -- it feels like a more ethereal brand of steampunk, complete with Victorian trappings and advanced airships. It's full of glowing light, vast expanses of cloads and flowing cities, and beautiful mountainous landscapes and clouds that could have come straight from a Hayao Miyazaki movie. Not to mention some brilliant airborne battles.

The many subplots of the series unspool gradually throughout each episode, twining together as the plot goes on -- such as Alex's vendetta, the plans of the villain Delphine, and the mysterious Grand Stream that seems to be central to the mysteries of Prester. The dialogue is rather run-of-the-mill, but the carefully-drawn world (complete with water shortages and a fictional fuel called ""claudia"") make up for that, as well as the tangled political clashes that stretch from one episode to the next.

The last few episodes are a bit of a mindbender. The plot becomes a bit tangled up, before twisting into a startling revelation about the world of Prester -- which admittedly, while carefully foreshadowed, is quite a surprise when it's revealed.

Claus and Lavie make a likable pair of protagonists -- he's mellow, sweet and rather laid-back, while she's fiery and easily upset (""This is OUR vanship, and YOU can't touch it!""), so they end up playing well off each other. And the supporting cast is a pretty solid one, with a ride range of personalities and plenty of likable minor characters (like the mechanics). Among the standouts: the melancholy and mysterious Alex Rowe, Alvis, the whimsical and tragic Dio, and vanship pilot Tatiana (who develops a crush on Claus).

""Last Exile: The Complete Series"" has a few odd twists, but it's a solid and atmospheric anime series that glides slowly to a rather startling conclusion.",1239580800,2,3617,4.885807504078303

8344893,5,B001US3XUK,"In the steampunk world of Prester, torn by endless war refereed by the Guild between two old and bitter enemies, Anatoray and Disith, separated by a belt of turbulence known as the Grand Stream, two 15-year-olds, Claus Valca and Lavie Head, orphans of another set of vanship pilots who died trying to cross the Grand Stream, survive as vanship couriers and racers with the dream of someday outdoing their fathers, until a dying vanship pilot asks them to take over a mysterious mission involving delivering a mysterious ""package"", 11-year-old girl Alvis E. Hamilton, to the equally mysterious Alexander Row, captain of the infamous ""Kill 'Em All"" Sylvana, a flying battleship carrier allegedly under their government's control.  After succeeding in doing so, despite violent interference by the Guild, Claus and Lavie decide to stay put on board the Sylvana in order to watch over Al.  Thus begins an intricate mystery and struggle which Al's self-appointed protectors must figure out and survive.

This was an amazing ride, a grand adventure as Claus and Lavie gradually prove themselves to the Sylvana's captain and crew as the various interlocking schemes come to light and unravel.  In particular I was struck by how perfectly all the characters lived or died so that I didn't have a single complaint, though some careful attention must be paid to both the audio and visual at the end in order to see it all.

Defects?  Well, even though a lot of information you can look up elsewhere was left out, I was again astonished by how perfectly what was left balanced out.  You will likely be tempted to read more later, but every important thing was mentioned in the English dub.  Astonishing!

8344896,4,B001US3XUK,"For as long as human beings have existed, we have prided ourselves in being a species of innovation and success, and out successes have led us to imagine reaching more prestigious accomplishments than before; eventually, our dreams not surprisingly ventured into the skies. Since the dawn of time, humans gazed upward at the birds gliding under the clouds and we desperately desired to soar as well. In ancient Greece, one of the most enduring myths from that time is the tale of Icarus, who attempted escaping prison with his father by donning a pair of wings. In Italy during the Renaissance, the famous Leonardo da Vinci crafted elaborate designs for aviation but hid them for years, fearing that influential people would have corrupt uses for them. In the 1800s, an African-American folk tale surfaced throughout the Deep South titled All Gods Chillun Had Wings, which revolved around black slaves floating away from the oppressive white owners and returning to their homeland Africa. All of these ideas and more eventually culminated in the Wright Brothers inventing the first airplane during the early 1900s. This creation served as the catalyst for films like Porco Rosso, Red Tails, and (of course) Soul Plane. However, before the 2000s, there were no anime series representing that category. Then, in the spring of 2003, the world was introduced to a 26-episode series known as Last Exile, the 10th anniversary product of Studio Gonzo, humankinds ultimate celebration of our adventures in the sky.

 Established on the Earth-like planet called Prester are two vastly different nations (Anatoray and Disith), locked in a neverending war of chivalry, elitism, and death in order to attain control of the skies. Fully immersed into this Cold War parallel (with Anatorays guys in blue being the USA and Disiths soldiers in red coats being, of course, the Soviet Union) is a mysterious cult-ish organization known as the Guild, headed by the infamous Maestro Delphine, who supplies advanced airplanes, funds, and weaponry to both Anatoray and Disith, who both countries regard with intense suspicion, and who represent the corrupt companies that have bought into, promoted, and benefited from war over the centuries. Like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (what I consider to be the animes anime), Exiles background is inspired by the apex of the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s/early 1900s, its genre heavily leaning towards the retrofuturistic dieselpunk. This ultimately helps the series inject a lovably throwback feel to it, and this influence flows into other aspects of Exile, like the animation.

 More often than not, anime series tend to rely on computer graphics (CG for short) in order to make their characters and backgrounds look more realistic than the creators can on their own. More often than not, the creators completely shoot themselves in the foot in the animation category because the CG looks and feels utterly out-of-place in their series. However, Last Exile is among the rare series that manage to not only display picture-perfect CG but also to flawlessly integrate it into the animation. It is so smoothly blended into Exile that, for the most part, the CG use isn't blatantly obvious. Among the most apparent CG uses in Exile is during in-battle aerial attacks, where it is used to emphasize the whispery blue and gray explosion smoke. In every scene, theres a faded tint present in the animation that causes this series to feel seasoned but appear brand-new; this tint also contributes to strengthening Exiles aforementioned throwback feel. The impact of Last Exiles animation on the series overall, already brilliantly jaw-dropping as it is, increases when it journeys into the cinematic. In episode 13, the sound of gunfire is used to guide the transition from one dramatic still shot to another. Theres a stunning scene in episode 18, where blood-red rose petals are slowly drifting from the sky to signal the beginning of Maestro Delphines active involvement in the series. In episode 22, theres beautifully back lighting of Delphines face as she presents herself in front of her followers. This scene emanates a strong hint of majestic malevolence thanks to the haunting, mysterious chimes that are showcased here, which leads to another aspect Last Exile excels at: its soundtrack.

 The conventional method of producing an anime soundtrack is giving one person the authority to decide what fits and what doesnt, what sounds complement the series and what doesnt, and what the musics tone will be overall. For Cowboy Bebop, it was Yoko Kanno. For Gurren Lagann, it was Taku Iwasaki. For Afro Samurai, it was Robert Diggs (aka The RZA). The implied consensus is that more than one person composing an anime OST is a recipe for disaster. However, Last Exile has three people lording over the soundtrack (the call themselves Dolce Triade) and it still manages to be spectacular. First of all, the theme song (Shuntara Okinos Cloud Age Symphony), and ending theme (Hitomi Kuroishis Over the Sky) are both phenomenally performed and composed. This show absorbs you into it and makes you feel like you're in the sky with its excellent, atmospheric soundtrack. During fights, its mostly grandiose, Hans Zimmer-esque orchestral music used to craft a gung-ho mood; only in the most action-packed sequences are passionate violin solos in attendance. A vague presence of somber jazz is occasionally woven into the soundtrack while complex compositions of piano and drums appear in Exiles more relaxed scenes. The soundtrack wouldve been my favorite aspect of this series, if not for the characters.

The success or failure of this operations hinges on the efforts of the entire crew,  Sophia Forrester (episode 19)

 Unlike a lot of anime series, Last Exiles cast is, for the most part, one filled with real people, with real emotions, with real aspirations, and with real idiosyncrasies. The characters relationships and interactions with each other is the crme de la crme of this series. The All-Star voiceover crew that contribute their talents to Last Exile help immensely with the characterization overall, big names like Steve Blum, Michelle Ruff, Crispin Freeman, and Johnny Yong Bosch dropping by here. As a result, more than a few characters are able to establish themselves as unforgettable figures in Exile. Dio Eraclea is Exiles comic relief, a wildly unpredictable eccentric often in a playful mood (Lucciola, Dios absurdly quiet companion, serves as a stark contrast to this free spirit) but later on his sanity spirals downward until his former self is completely gone. Mullen is a soldier in the Anatoray/Disith War and, while he wouldve been forgettable in any other anime, he shines as a particularly immortal supporting character; Mullen is the embodiment of the Everyday Man with a purpose in life that helps drive the series forward. Lavie Head is one of the two protagonists of this series (Claus Valca is the other; Ill get to him later), the heart and soul of Last Exile. At the start of the series, Lavie can be best described as a fiery soul (extremely common among animes other red-headed chicks), a mechanic of exuberance and passion yet hardened by the very personal effects of the War. As Last Exile progresses, Lavies enthusiasm mellows out, revealing a character thats more self-reflective and soft-hearted than before (She occasionally dips her toes into philosophy). From beginning to end, Lavie is among the series most likable characters (as well as one of my favorites). Maestro Delphine is the antagonist of Exile; she is the aforementioned ruler of the Guild, utterly unquestioned in her authority, single-minded in her elitist worldview. In her role as Delphine, Karen Strassman delivers her distinctly soft and sexy whisper of a voice yet theres a razor-sharp coldness to her gentleness that hasn't been present in any of her previous voiceovers. In whats arguably the greatest performance of her career, Strassman strides into her role, emphasizing the mystique, the snobbery, and the sadism that serve as this characters most defining traits. There are more than a few unexplained aspects involving Delphine; however, she is still an enjoyably arrogant villainess but unfortunately not the most unforgettable character. Maestro Delphine, instead, will have to settle for second place, surpassed only by my favorite character: the man, the myth, and the legend, Alex Freaking Row.

If I don't come into this willing to sink him, then I won't be able to defeat Alex Row,  Vincent Alzay (Episode 12)

 In a series for which characterization is a calling card, Alex Row stands out. In a series celebrating the virtues of the spectacular, Alex Row stands out. In a medium that glorifies the dark and brooding, Alex Row stands out. He is the fearsome captain of the infamous Silvana, a man whose name is regarded with uneasy respect due to his unrivaled in-battle accomplishments; it is also due to his personality essentially being a complex jigsaw puzzle. Row is a man of mystery whose all-black character design causes him to appear as a nightmarish specter when blended into the shadows. Like a ghost, Row doesnt walk but glides, vanishing from sight almost immediately after he materializes. With the aid of his blank, almost serene visage, Rows bored yet ice-cold gaze causes more than a few characters to wilt in intimidation; he simply obliterates people with his stare. Unlike the punch-drunk brawlers that have for years invaded the anime world, the sophisticated Silvana captain is a man of strategy, often planning much farther ahead of his opponents, sparing no sentimental notions in his pursuit of victory (Of course, he is also an excellent chess player on the side). When not in battle, Row keeps to himself, a liquor bottle at his side, contemplating his past and drowning his woes in alcohol in order to avoid confessing his sins of long ago. Throughout the duration of Exile, Row is concealing a heartbreaking backstory involving Delphine and is harboring a deep-seated hatred for her. In his epic years-long quest for revenge, Row cruelly pushes away anyone attempting to get close to him (occasionally, this includes Sophia, the person who cares about him the most). Row has effectively sealed his true feelings in a cage inside his heart (like Paul D in Toni Morrisons Beloved) while maintaining an exterior of morally questionable motives, withering remarks, and unsettling coldness. At some point in this series, I was no longer a member of the Alex Row Fan Club. Dont get me wrong; he was still a well-written character and an intriguing one at that. You respected Row but Im not sure you truly sympathized with him. Ultimately, it was easy to assume that he was establishing a legacy as an unsatisfying character, and that he would have no further involvement in Exile. What happened? Late in the series (episode 21 of 26, in fact), Delphine and her Guild capture the Silvana and are searching around the ship for the captain. They eventually give up and are just about to depart the Silvana when Alex Freaking Row materializes out of nowhere, rapidly firing bullet after bullet at the attacking Guild members with a pair of gunknives. (Like, who does that?). After this magnificent comeback, Delphine imprisons and poisons Row, slowly decomposing his body away by the second. As before, I held my doubts that Row would re-emerge into the spotlight but, in the end, he does it in such a thrilling and climatic fashion that the whole sequence is a spoiler I won't ruin. The message, as always: don't underestimate Alex Freaking Row. He is a Byronic Hero of epic proportions, voyaging across the skies for redemption. He is a man of 007-esque coolness (In one scene, Row even steals an immortal line from GoldenEye while talking to Sophia as he says, Its [revenge] is what keeps me alive,) but is more than capable of unleashing raw outbursts of fury. He is a warrior of almost-mythical formidability but displays strokes of vulnerability more often than not. He is, above all else, what all anime antiheroes should aspire to be, the Batman of this medium. Its no wonder that the brain trust behind Last Exile originally intended for Alex Freaking Row to be the main character.

Then, what caused this same brain trust to ultimately choose Claus Valca over Row?

Up in these skies, I was nothing but a spectator,  Claus Valca (episode 25)

 During Claus first experience inside the Guilds lair, he refers to the zomibified Dio as an empty, soulless shell. Claus evaluation of Dio is deliciously ironic in that Dio 2.0 isn't the only blank slate in Exile. Its downright shocking that, in a series overflowing with realistic, well-written characters, the protagonist is yet another walking clich, yet another subpar self-insert leading man. Watching Claus, who receives the most screen time by far, trek through Last Exile is a thoroughly frustrating experience for several reasons. This guy has one job to do, to one-up his dead daddy by crossing a particularly treacherous section of the sky known as the Grand Stream, but for a lengthy stretch of the series couldn't manage that without getting sidetracked. First, Claus wants to protect a shy loli named Alvis (entrusted to him and Lavie early on), who by the way is secured on the Silvana (often dubbed the safest place in the world). (Alvis doesnt need protecting, you idiot!) Then, Claus decides to forsake his lifelong mission while claiming the Silvana as his residence in order to know whats going on in the skies, a truly brainless move that made me and Lavie pissed off. (You can do that while looking for the Grand Stream!) As you can probably tell, Ive been irritated at Claus existence virtually from the start but what marginal sympathy I held for him was utterly expunged in episodes 14 to 16 or as I like to label it the Harem King Arc. From the very beginning, Lavie and Gale (the Silvanas homosexual mechanic) have obviously had a thing for Claus. Then, he suddenly becomes the object of sexual obsession for the kuudere pilot Tatiana. To top it all off, Claus receives a kiss from none other than a princess (Seriously, when did this guy become Mr. Steal Your Girl?). Its pathetic that a series as phenomenal as this attempts convincing you that this forgettable, monotonous, almost-robotic kid with the personality of a stuffed animal is actually a ladies man. More than anything else, what causes the Harem King Arc to embody the very worst of this classic is that its never discussed, mentioned, or referenced again. It pains me to criticize Claus Valca like this because his voice actor is the legendary Johnny Yong Bosch (the same man who wonderfully exuded an easygoing faade while masking a volatile whirlwind of fear, sorrow, and indignation in his role as Triguns Vash the Stampede), and I expected Bosch to dominate here like he did in Trigun but that never happened. Speaking of disappointment, the grand finale of Last Exile can be best described as rushed. There are several unintroduced plot elements that just sucker-punch you without warning, leaving the finales events to feel thrown together. In this episode, a beloved character dies needlessly and pathetically (though I heard he somehow re-emerges for the sequel) while another fan favorite, this one tragically killed, abruptly pops in during the time skip alive and well (Seeing this guys grinning face rise from the cornfield almost gave me a heart attack). In spite of my thoughts on Claus and the series finale, Last Exile still earns my respect for exploring a unique genre in anime, for thriving as the rare series that didn't originate from a manga, and for an excellent representation of the joys of aviation.",1471219200,,15756,5.036823935558113
