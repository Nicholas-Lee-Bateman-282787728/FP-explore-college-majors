5105113,4,B007R5A1KU,"AS an avid Mets fan who worships the team through the highs and many lows, it baffles me how the organization can omit not one but TWO of their World Series MVPs (Donn Clendenon, 1969 and Ray Knight, 1986) from the Mets Museum.  The team has only two world championships, both of which would not have been won if not for the accomplishments of their Most Valuable Players.  But again, it's the METS we're talking about, who seem to do everything ass-backwards.  The DVD is great, giving kudos to almost every player who wore the uniform.  Ray Knight is given credit, but Donn Clendenon has been left out.  I'll never understand how a team lauds their two world series victories but yet doesn't give credit to the man who played a HUGE part in their winning their first ring, first baseman Donn Clendenon.  Like Gary Carter in 1986, Clendenon was indeed the missing piece of their championship puzzle.",1355788800,2,900,4.6645569620253164

8521184,3,B007R5A1KU,"It's just that the highlights of each player was too short. For example, one quick highlight of Ho Jo and he hits a home run right handed? Ehhhhh...any older Mets fan is irked by that",1367712000,,183,4.257142857142857

Thank you!

8521187,5,B007R5A1KU,Good list.  Fun to watch.  Don't agree with all of the choices and the order but all in all it is very well done.  Met fans will enjoy it!,1359244800,,138,3.689655172413793
8521188,5,B007R5A1KU,"This was a very good DVD. Avid Mets fans will enjoy it very much. Main program is the same as the SportsNet New York (SNY) hour-long show on TV. However, the DVD contains some extra material (segment on Dave Mlicki's shutout in first Subway series game ever, for instance). There is also some ""bonus"" material of great moments like last inning of 1969 World Series from the NBC TV coverage, for example. Well worth the price if you are a big Mets fan like me. One note however - this is also contained as one DVD in the Mets 50th Anniversary 10 DVD set (extra & bonus materials also).",1357689600,,584,4.36697247706422
