7910542,2,B00000ICGP,"1.) Kendo Stick Hardcore Match: Brian Knobs w/Jimmy Hart vs Hak w/Chastity

A good Hardcore opening match for the night. Sandman had recently came down from ECW to WCW to do some work in the company under the name Hak. Tons of weapons were brought out in this one; a ladder, a chair, trash can, trash can lid, and of course kendo sticks. Hak gets the victory over Brian after a head shot with the kendo stick. Hugh Morrus jumps Hak after the match and piledrives Hak as well as moonsaults him on a ladder.

2.) Mikey Whipwreck vs Van Hammer

Just like Sandman, Whipwreck was another ECW alumni, doing a short stint in WCW. Basic but decent match. Van Hammer wins via pinfall after a Cobra Clutch Slam on Whipwreck

3.) Disco Inferno vs Buff Bagwell

Awesome match from these two. Seeing this match makes me realize that Bagwell and Disco were two underrated wrestlers from WCW. Bagwell hits the Blockbuster on Disco for the win

4.) Curt Hennig and Bobby Duncum Jr vs Konnan and Rey Mysterio

Everything about this feud was stupid. This whole match happened over a feud about whether rap or country was the better song genre. Seriously? Stuff like this really made me hate WCW. Was this WCW or high school band class? Wasn't interested in the match, Master P's bodyguard of the No Limit Soldiers attacks Duncum Jr while the ref's back was turned. Mysterio capitalizes with a slingshot leg drop on Duncum Jr for the win. Duncum Jr attacks Mysterio after the match and hog ties Mysterio while Konnan is forced to watch

5.) The Cat vs Horace Hogan

Boring match. The Cat gets the win after Sonny Onoo interfered and put something on The Cat's shoe and Cat sidekicked Horace for the win

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Ric Flair w/Asya and Arn Anderson vs Rowdy Roddy Piper - Winner becomes President of WCW

The build-up for this feud was really good. Piper had a problem with Flair running WCW and tried to overthrow his position of power and enlisted the aid of Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko to help him do it. The match ends on a DQ when Buff Bagwell interferes and attacks Ric Flair. And in a typical WCW swerve, we see Piper turn on Bagwell at the end of the match, and he, Flair, and Bagwell all beat down on Bagwell

7.) Falls Count Anywhere Match: Rick Steiner vs Sting

A great match put on by Sting and Steiner. Lots of back and forth action offered up in this match and was very enjoyable to watch. However, the greatness of this match is ruined with the crappy B.S. ending when Sting is attacked backstage by a pack of vicious dogs. Just a horrible ending to a great match. Then again, WCW is infamous for ruining great matches with stupid booked endings

8.) WCW Tag Team Championship Match: DDP and Kanyon w/Bam Bam Bigelow vs Chris Benoit and Saturn (c)

Amazing match, hands down, no questions asked. This match was excellent in terms of athleticism, wrestling, and excitement. After a rather lackluster night, this match really picked the PPV up. DDP and Kanyon get the win after Bigelow and DDP hit Benoit with a Double Diamond Cutter after the referee was distracted by Dean Malenko who came to the ring to assist Saturn

9.) WCW World Championship Match: Macho Man Randy Savage w/Gorgeous George, Madusa, and Miss Madness vs Kevin Nash (c)

This feud was based off of Randy Savage developing a new dark persona and having his sights set on the WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Kevin Nash. Leading up to the PPV, Savage trapped Nash inside of a limo where an unknown person in a hummer, rammed into the limo 3 times. I don't know what WCW's obsession was with limos getting destroyed and hummers running into limos. They'd done that story at least 3 or 5 times in their history and it was just one of the many things they ran to the ground. The main event itself was too short. It didn't even last 15 minutes. Which it should have or even 20. The match ends on a DQ when Sid Vicious returns to WCW and attacks Nash with a powerbomb.

Overall: Not the best Great American Bash PPV WCW had to offer. Aside from 2 or 3 matches, this PPV was a bummer. All the other matches were either boring, had a stupid build-up or had a stupid ending. And of course, the matches that did have great build-up were ruined with bad endings (with the exception of the Tag Team match). I've seen better Great American Bash PPVs",1404432000,,5119,5.4562737642585555
7910543,3,B00000ICGP,"The Brian Knobbs-Hak hardcore match was not great but pretty good. The Hammer-Mikey Whipwreck,Buff Bagwell-Disco Inferno, & the Ernest Miller-Horace Hogan matches were all just fillers. The bout between The No Limit Solders(Konnan & Rey Misterio Jr) against The West Texas Rednecks(Curt Henning & Bobby Duncum Jr) was pretty one-sided and mainly focusing on Rey & Curt too much. The Ric Flair-Roddy Piper match for full control of WCW while not a good match, it was still a entertaining at times. The Falls Count Anywhere match between Rick Steiner & Sting was a solid brawl with a scary ending to boot. The world tag team title match between The Jeresy Triad(DDP & Kanyon) & the team of Chris Beniot & Perry Saturn was pretty solid for a tag bout. The Kevin Nash-Randy Savage world title match was a pretty good brawl ruined by a DQ ending. I give this event a 6 out of 10.",1280016000,,874,4.645161290322581

7910545,2,B00000ICGP,"Unlike my other recent ""flashback"" WCW reviews, this isn't an old event I found...I only found 1 match on another tape because this card was so awful that I still remember it almost a decade later.  Normally I do a match by match review for these events but I'm not going to waste my time repeating the same thing over & over again.  This was a one match PPV & that match was the World Tag Team Titles with Chris Benoit & Perry Saturn vs. the ""Jersey Triad"" in DDP & Kanyon with Bam Bam Bigelow who at that time were using the old ""Freebird"" rule in that any 2 out of 3 members of the team could be wrestling.  It was just great wrestling that you expect out of all four involved in the ring.  The rest of the card however ranged from boring fillers (Van Hammer/Mikey Whipwreck, Ernest Miller/Horace Hogan, Buff Bagwell/Disco Infernio) to just average/passable matches (Hak/Brian Knobbs was the same hardcore weapons match you've seen 2-3 times a week at that time so it was nothing special, Konnan/Mysterio vs. Hennig/Duncam starting the ""Rap Is Crap"" angle with rapper Master P).  The rest of the matches fall under the catagory of just awful booking like Sting vs. Rick Steiner were having a solid match before the ending with dogs attacking ""Sting"" (you can clearly see that it was a stunt double with a wig on) in a pointless angle that was killed off & forgotten about the next night on Nitro, Flair & Piper having a poorly executed brawl that resulted in them joining forces in the end when Bagwell accidently got Piper disqualified, and the main event being real short & was just there to set up the return of Sid Vicious to side with Randy Savage.  This wasn't on the level of awful like the 1991 edition (there wasn't one good match on that card) of the Bash but this was right on the level of how the PPV was once WWE's SmackDown brand took it over where it was a one/two match show.  Avoid this at all cost because the only reason this got two stars was the outstanding WCW Tag Team Title match, the hardcore match, and Sting vs. Rick Steiner before the ending.",1219449600,,2073,4.425196850393701
7910546,3,B00000ICGP,"This ppv was a typical average WCW show. Which weren't as bad as some people will tell you. Some WCW ppv's stunk and some were alright. This was an example of an alright one.

Hardcore Hak(Sandman)v.s Brian Knobbs- Alot of trashcan lid shots to the head. An average hardcore match that stays in the ring. 6/10

Van Hammer v.s Mikey Whipwreck- Filler match but still an ok one. Whipwreck takes some hard bumps. 6.5/10

Buff Bagwell v.s Disco Inferno- I love Buff! The match is pritty good. But it could have been better 7.5/10

Curt Henning and Bobby Duncam jr v.s Rey Mysterio and Konnan- Master P sits at ring side and his no limit soldiers get involved. Kind of a slow match and Rey is kept grounded. 7/10

The Cat v.s Horace Hogan- The Cat is funny with his promo before the match. The match however was a dud 3/10

Ric Flair v.s Roddy Piper for control of WCW- Huge swerve at the end of the match. An ok match if it had happend 5-10 years earlier it would have been a classic. 7/10

Sting v.s Rick Steiner falls count anywhere- A good match. The ending is sooooo fake though. You will see what I mean!!! But an overall good match. 8/10

DDP and Kanyon v.s Chris Bennoit and Perry Saturn for the WCW tag team championships- Slightly overated, however still a good match. 8/10

Kevin Nash v.s Randy Savage for the WCW World Title- Stinker of a main event. As many WCW main events were this was kept too short. In my opinion main events should be 20 -30 mins long. Not 10 or 15. Nice surprise return though! 7/10",1119916800,3,1513,4.336879432624113
7910547,4,B00000ICGP,"The Undercard suffered a lot on this one. Bagwell/Disco was ok, Sting/Steiner was horrible,Piper/Flair had the match of the night. It was good to see Sid come Back but why didn't they have him come out at the Previous Pay-Per-View Slamboree?The other good match was the Tag Team Title Bout.",998956800,,290,4.82
7910548,1,B00000ICGP,"I truly think that this is the worst pay per view I have ever seen.  Three of the biggest matches, including the main event, ended in either a disqualification or no contest.  The return of Sid was awesome, but the  fact that he ruined the main event is horrible. The only two matches I  enjoyed watching were the hardcore match between Knobbs and Hak, and the  Tag Team Title match between The Triad and Saturn and Benoit.  Also on the  pay per view were martches that shouldn't even be on Saturday Night, like  Horace vs. The Cat, and Mikey Whipwreck vs. Van Hammer.  This is why I feel  this is one of the worst pay per views ever and i strongly urge you to not  buy it.",956793600,3,673,4.2204724409448815
7910549,3,B00000ICGP,"I thought the ppv was pretty good. Sting vs. Rick Steiner was good but ended kind of stupid. The tag team title match was awesome with Saturn & Benoit vs. New Jersey Triad. I thought the three stupidest matches of  the night was Mikey Whipwreck vs. Van Hammer, The Cat vs. Horace, Buff  Bagwell vs. Disco Inferno. Loved the return of Sid in the title match,  AWESOME!  Hak vs. Knobbs was a pretty good match as well. Pretty good pay  per view but I have seen better.",943747200,,466,4.310344827586207
