5563272,5,B00B8PRDHE,"Great energy, wonderful songs, and an absolutely ALL STAR BAND! And it was recorded at the Ryman Auditorium. Can't get much better. Happy 72nd birthday Ringo, and best wishes for MANY more!",1364601600,9,189,4.9375
5563273,5,B00B8PRDHE,"SWEET! I happen to live in Nashville and before this show at the historic Ryman Auditorium, Ringo was at the downtown Nashville Hard Rock cafe to celebrate his birthday and do his annual ""Peace & Love"" wish for the world. Extra cool because it just happens to be my birthday as well. (Oh, and I'm a drummer too). I filmed the whole event and edited it down to this 4:32 video, which includes a spontaneous rendition of ""Give Peace A Chance"". Also, I was holding up a sign that said ""It's My Birthday Too, YEAH!"" Ringo pointed, read the sign aloud... and wished ME a ""Happy Birthday, Brother!""!! And it's all on video.
[...]
While I did not get a ticket for the show, I was honored to sit in the production truck during the filming and got to watch Ringo sing ""Boys"" and ""Yellow Submarine"" on the multi-angle monitor. Certainly one of the coolest birthdays I ever had! Bloody-hell, a BEATLE wished ME a happy birthday!",1362614400,30,917,4.497005988023952

5563281,5,B00B8PRDHE,Ringo has surrounded himself with the best of the best.. Ringo is at the top of his game and there is not a better singing guitarist on the planet than Steve Lukather. Gregg Rollie was the best singer and keyboardist for Santana and Journey. Greg Bissonette is a stellar rhythm machine and a blast to watch play. Todd Rundgren is always awesome and Richard Page as well as Mark Rivera are two fantastic musicians.  The guests were a blast. I recommend this to any Beatle fan or fans of any of the others. The music is excellent...,1444608000,,530,4.463917525773196

5563285,4,B00B8PRDHE,"I have never been  huge fan of Ringo or most of his songs . . .if he were not an ex-Beatle he would just be another so-so artist. But, his band he tours with ROCKS!!
Steve Lukather is very well known among rock fans that pay attention and any guitarist that aspires to one day be good probably studies his chops already. Richard Page can still sing like crazy and some folks will be surprised when they see who was a big part of the great sound that the band Santana put out (Greg Rolie). And of course Joe Walsh is always a tremendous treat.",1436400000,,542,4.161904761904762

5563289,4,B00B8PRDHE,"overall, a great concert with some outstanding musicians. Steve Lukather, Greg Rollie, Todd Rundgren, and Richard Page are all from major successful bands. Gregg Bissonette is a killer drummer, I can see why he's in demand as a session expert. Biggest surprise to me was Mark Rivera, multi-instrumentalist I'd heard (Billy Joel) but never knew his name. He's so much more than a sax player.
Not many singers can hit the high parts in Rossanna (Toto) but he nails it outright. Luke and all the guys look like they are having a complete blast playing together and doing each other's songs spot on.
I respect Ringo and all the many drummers he inspired to learn to play. The Beatles invasion changed my life as well as many others.
There are some good songs on here that he penned, and he still seems to have the ""gift."" I'm not a big fan of his music, but I am very grateful that he had the vision to put on this show. Greatly enjoyed it, highly recommended for Toto, Santana, Todd, and Mr Mr fans. And of course Ringo fans. Excellent performances all. By the way, this was mixed exceptionally well, sounds great.",1430611200,,1111,4.56
5563290,5,B00B8PRDHE,"The Ryman concert has some of the best video performances. When a venue is designed for music and the recording is done by pros the results are much better. Assuming you are a Ringo-All Starr Band fan, you will be happy you bought this.",1428883200,,236,4.386363636363637

Better than all the remaining 3 Beatles ever thought of being in their day, especially Preppy Sir Paul! Ringo has been practicing. Long ways from the little 5-piece drum set when I had the pleasure of seeing him live in 1964 at Tulane U. I earned $78 a month as an Airman 3rd Class in the USAF. Spent $5 for a concert ticket! Saved the stub all these years.
Richard Page still has a great voice in 2012!",1406592000,,483,4.377777777777778
5563299,3,B00B8PRDHE,"I love the sound quality. I love the performances. I love the cast of musicians. What I don't love is thinking I was buying a 16:9 DVD when what they did is take a 4:3 regular screen and stretch it out, making everybody look short and fat, and circles become oblong. It says 16:9 on the box cover. But, it's just 4:3 stretched out. It's just horrible that UMe did this to an otherwise fantastic DVD. I am SO upset that I will never buy another UMe product again.",1406419200,,462,4.202247191011236

5563303,5,B00B8PRDHE,I initially bought this DVD to see Steve Lukather do his (Toto) thing which he did and I was totally pleased!!! Todd Rundgren was also great as was Gregg Rolie (Santana) and Richard Page (Mr. Mister). Pumped through a good sound system this makes for a great party video as they all play their hits!!!,1397779200,,301,4.490909090909091
5563304,5,B00B8PRDHE,"This is going to sound corny as hell but here goes.  ""Ringo at the Ryman"" is simply one of my all time favorite DVDs.  That so many top rate musicians and singers could come together and create such great and happy music just stuns me.  Just watching the DVD is a happy experience as it is clear that the musicians are having a great time.  As for the music, there are passages that are just so beautiful and perfect that it literally brings tears to my eyes.

After purchasing it, I purchased additional copies for my son, daughter and step-daughter for Christmas gifts thinking and believing that if they like this album half as much as I do then it would be one of the best Christmas gifts I could give.

I love this DVD.  Buy it and feel happy.",1397779200,,748,4.3
5563305,5,B00B8PRDHE,This is from Nashville 2012. I was born in Nashville. I had to have it. I love it! This is my third DVD  of Ringo in concert. I saw the Beatles in Memphis in 1966. I saw Paul on the U.S.A. tour. I can not wait to see Ring in 2014.,1396915200,,230,3.5098039215686274

5563309,5,B00B8PRDHE,"We saw Ringo's All-Star concert live at Mohegan Sun, CT just 2 weeks prior to this recording of ""Ringo at the Ryman"". It was a magical night and I was blown away by the performance. Having this DVD allows me to relive the magic at home!  We wondered how old he was during the CT concert, knowing he must be 70+. The Ryman concert was actually taped on his 72nd birthday!! He ""gets by with a little help from his friends!""",1389657600,,421,4.197530864197531

5563311,4,B00B8PRDHE,"I would have given this dvd 5 stars if it weren't for the intermittantly annoying dropouts of the subwoofer audio channel which another reviewer also had complained about. Apparently they get around this flaw by only declaring it to be a 2-channel stereo mix, but the sub channel exists and does decode.  I don't understand why they released it that way.  Fix the sub audio channel and this would be a 5 Star purchase!",1389052800,,418,4.635135135135135
5563312,5,B00B8PRDHE,I went to a live show out on Long Island and enjoyed it. This tape brought back those wonderful memories that only Ringo can recreate.,1388620800,,134,4.4
5563313,5,B00B8PRDHE,"This may be the best music concert DVD I have, and I have many.  It ain't easy to say that because while I was waiting for it to arrive in the mail, I viewed ""The Concert for Bangladesh"" & ""The Concert for George"" the night before, so I had fresh ""dream"" performances on my mind.  But, this is 2014, and technology, plus current changes in music performance techniques makes one have higher standards in performance expectations of such presentations.

Who are these guys that Ringo, and his team, recruited for this tour?  Gregg Rolie? Richard Page? Steve Lukather?  I had not heard of these guys, but I knew about the bands they had been in, and the song titles certainly rang familiar bells in my mind.  Also, Ringo concerts have been very enjoyable in the past with guys doing great songs that I was really pleased to have in my library.  Ain't no point in renting them, because I find myself wanting to watch them repeatedly.  So I ordered this show.

MAN! That Richard Page can sing in the stratosphere!  He was the guy that sang that ""Broken Wings"" song with the great chord changes.  When he steps in the help out with the TOTO classics, the magic explodes!  The Lukather guy is a brilliant lead guitar player with current guitar methods, and equipment that just blew me away over  & over, even on the Ringo classic songs!  They open with an updated version of the ""Matchbox"" chestnut that may be the best version of that tune I have ever heard. The Rolie guy is a Santana veteran, and they do those great standards so well that those songs make the DVD worth having just for to have wonderful versions of ""Evil Ways"" and ""Black Magic Woman"" alone.  Watching Lukather & Rolie work together with the excellent Bissonette on drums leaves me speechless.

I ain't no Todd Rundgren fan really, but his version of ""Love is the Answer"" is just so good that I had to watch it twice immediately.  Rundgren is a veteran, and he adds to any band, but he almost is superficial to this lineup.

This band has muscle, power, and they play LOUD!  The show just has that wonderful ""strong"" feel that you would expect at a Journey, or Foreigner concert, unlike most of Ringo's prior shows.  His earlier concerts are often very good, but this show is a whole other thing.  You just want to play it as loud as you can to get all this wonderful bass, drum, and guitar sound.  When they play ""Hold the Line"" you just want it to never end, ...that is one GOOD song!!

Ringo draws a varied audience including a lot of young kids; so he has to do ""Yellow Submarine"", etc. for them.  But I would like him to explore some other ideas, like maybe doing some Harrison and Lennon songs that he could sing. He can deliver vocally a lot better than most expect these days.  In fact, he is the glue that makes this kind of show work!  Watching him play the drums on those Toto classics reveals just how good a musician he really is.

Now one might protest that he could not do Harrison songs because those numbers often have sitar, and other exotic instruments incorporated within the sound.  Well that Rivera guy who stands in the back is about as talented as McCartney when it comes to playing other instruments.  That guy can play ANYTHING, and sing like Mickey Thomas (Starship) when it is needed!

Ringo just gets better, and better as a master of ceremony.  It is his stage, and when Vince Gill, and Paisley come out at the end; Ringo is still the star out there.  He may be 72 years old, but you have to just take his word for it, because he moves & sings like a forty year old on stage.

If you like Pop/ROCK music - DON'T miss this concert! (And go see Lukather, Page, & Rolie any chance you get!)",1388534400,,3682,4.407407407407407
5563314,4,B00B8PRDHE,"Ringo and his friends always made  good concerts, this one is not an exception..the the repertoir is different from the predecesors....... Is for beatle fans......!",1386547200,,164,5.56
5563315,5,B00B8PRDHE,"Better and better than expected, great Ringo songs, and great songs of the other members of the All Starr Band, I was at the show in Lima and was the same than this DVD except little changes, highly recoomended",1385683200,,210,4.410256410256411
5563316,5,B00B8PRDHE,"This is the best programmed All Starr band so far. The surprise is the bassist, part of Mister Mister who is surprisingly moving, Todd Rundgren does his thing well as do the rest of the band.",1384819200,,191,4.333333333333333

Still, the sound is very good, but on my system, it sounds better to turn off my Dolby Pro Logic and play it conventional stereo w/o any attempt by the receiver to play w/ making it something it isn't.

The band is outstanding and I highly recommend this one, just like all the other Ringo All Starr concerts.",1370044800,4,540,4.36

5563347,5,B00B8PRDHE,"I ordered this DVD because I've always wanted to see Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band, regardless of which version was on tour.  Most of the reviews were good, a couple were so-so and one was really bad, but I bought it anyway.  I love this concert at the Ryman.  One of the reviews said that the band members were just ""going thru the motions"".  I couldn't disagree more.  I think the sound quality is terrific, the band, in my opinion, seems to really go after it hard.  It's obvious they're having fun, and the crowd was on fire.  If I had one complaint, it would be that Ringo didn't do ""You're sixteen"", but he had a new CD to plug and did a couple songs from that.  One I though was pretty good, one I wasn't nuts about.  I love this concert and watched it again this weekend.  Loved Todd Rungren, Greg Rolie from Santana, Steve Lukather of Toto, Richard Page of Mister Mister, Mark Rivera, the sax player & percussionist, Greg Bissonette and Richard Page, the drummer and bass player, they were all terrific.

Unfortunately the tour did not venture anyplace close enough for us to get to the show, so I was absolutely thrilled when I found my way to this DVD.  I've only watched it once so far, but I enjoyed it so much that I really can't wait to watch it again.  The entire band was made up of front men, all heavyweights.  You could tell that they all loved the experience of playing together very much, and that they all loved and respected each other as artists.  I can only imagine what a thrill it must have been to be a member of the band.  A thrill that was definitely shared by all in attendance and even those who were not in attendance who could only watch it on DVD...  I love a good concert video, and this one is a new favorite for me.  The song selections were excellent, most of which are very likely to be the best ""live"" renditions that you will ever see or hear.  I sure hope that Ringo keeps doing this every summer.",1367539200,,1099,4.1415094339622645

Not only did we get to see Ringo perform some of his greatest hits, we also saw a bit of rock history with the assortment of fine musicians who brought their own songs from the past with them. It was like we put a few bucks in a really good juke box and just hit play! This DVD captured the whole thing and we can't get enough of it. Its great to see all of these guys still playing great music, together! We plan to see every All Starr tour that Ringo puts together.",1367366400,,565,3.8793103448275863

But this concert, filmed at Nashville's historic Ryman Auditorium on July 7, 2012 - Ringo's 72nd birthday - is the best All-Starr concert yet.  Not only does it feature Ringo perennials such as saxist Mark Rivera and drummer Gregg Bissonette, plus All-Starr alumnus Todd Rundgren, the lineup is incredible - Gregg Rolie of Santana and Journey, Steve Lukather of Toto, Richard Page of Mr. Mister, and a special guest appearance from Ringo's brother-in-law Joe Walsh (who is married to Barbara Bach Starkey's sister).  All of the artists perform their classic hits from the '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s, and Ringo opens the show with Carl Perkins' ""Matchbox"" from the Beatle days, and does two songs (""Wings"" and ""Anthem"") from his latest CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ringo-2012-Amazon-com-Exclusive-CD-DVD-Version/dp/B006OHJT5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ringo 2012 [Amazon.com Exclusive CD+DVD Version</a>].  You'll also hear Ringo perennials such as ""Photograph,"" ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""I Wanna Be Your Man,"" John Lennon's ""I'm The Greatest"" (""Now I'm only 72, and all I wanna do is boogaloo!""), ""It Don't Come Easy,""  and ""Act Naturally.""  For the finale, ""With A Little Help From My Friends/Give Peace A Chance,"" the All-Starr cast is joined by Joe Walsh's daughter Lucy, and several Nashville guest stars, including Brendan Benson, Kix Brooks, former Roundhead Gary Burr, Vince Gill (where was wife Amy Grant?), Brad Paisley, and former All-Starrs Felix Cavaliere (The Rascals) and Richard Marx.

Unlike previous Ringo All-Starr concerts, no audio CD was issued this time, only the DVD.  It's just as well, because this concert deserves to be seen, not just heard.

Now, if Universal would put out a DVD of Ringo's 70th birthday concert, filmed on July 7, 2010 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, which features Paul McCartney's spine-tingling performance of The Beatles' ""Birthday,"" which came as a total surprise to Ringo.

5563370,5,B00B8PRDHE,This captures the essence of a great night. There were so many highlights it's hard to know where to start. The Joe Walsh Special guest apperance is great & the Lukather/Rolie combination on the Santana songs are fantastic. Ringo is the ultimate host & the ending with all the Special Guests is EPIC! It was great to see Luke & Vince Gill having a BLAST at the end. Luke was all smiles the entire night. It was also cool being there seeing a wide variety of people enjoying themselves at the show. It was an AMAZING night as it was Ringo's 72nd Birthday at the Historic Ryman.,1364860800,11,576,4.392523364485982
5563371,5,B00B8PRDHE,"I've had the pleasure of attending every single All Starr Band tour since 1989, seeing each line up, hearing the great songs, and have collected every CD and DVD release from them. Further, I was privileged to have attended this very show at the Ryman in July of 2012.

That said, I can tell you this might well be the best band he's ever taken out. Sure, some of the earlier casts may have had more ""marquee"" names, and arguably even stronger catalogs to draw upon for the set list. But as a BAND - musicians playing cohesively and creatively - this group was the strongest. With prior ensembles that have had some of the great guitar players of the classic rock era (Randy Bachman, Nils Lofgren, Joe Walsh, Dave Edmunds, Peter Frampton, Rick Derringer and many others), Steve Lukather standing right up there and even surpassing them really says something. His playing - especially on the Santana songs sung by Gregg Rolie - is awe inspiring. Cross coverage on the vocal spots, most notably by Mark Rivera, further underscores how tight and polished these guys were. The mid-show guest appearance of Joe Walsh (""All Starr Band, Class of '89 ... and '93"" - sic, it was '92) is an added treat.

Of the several dozen shows I've seen by the various Ringo/ASB lineups over the years, this one was in the top two or three (right up there with another birthday show - his 70th, when Sir Paul joined in the proceedings).

Absolutely the finest DVD (so far) from Ringo's travelling roadshow.",1364860800,30,1484,4.634980988593156
5563372,5,B00B8PRDHE,"This was the second and best time that I had seen Ringo Starr's All Star Band (my first was with Edgar Winter, Billy Squire, Colin Hay, and Gary Wright). Just four days before this one was filmed, I drove 250 miles to see this lineup in Tuscaloosa, so this serves as a quasi-souvenir of that show. My main reason for driving that far was that I am a big fan of Todd Rundgren and Greg Rolie, and was looking forward to seeing both of them on stage together with Steve Lukather of Toto to boot. Ringo's brother-in-law Joe Walsh did not show up in Alabama, but almost steals the show in this one.

This was beautifully filmed and all of the musicians were having an absolute blast playing. This is the kind of DVD to be watched in a small party of long time friends and fans of The Beatles, Todd, Santana, and Toto. For me, the highlight is the Santana material with Steve Lukather on guitar. When Todd does Bang On The Drum All Day, notice that everyone is deliberately off key on vocals, because as Todd has said on previous tours, ""Now for some foolishness"". Enjoy this one!",1364774400,23,1074,4.37
