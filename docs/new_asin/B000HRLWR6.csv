8140857,5,B000HRLWR6,"It was Franois Truffaut who famously said, To put it bluntly [] there [is] a certain incompatibility between the terms cinema and Britain Well, no firmer refutation of this arrant nonsense can be found anywhere than in this superb box of 11 classic films from the celebrated pair Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The films all look absolutely terrific, are perfectly transferred and presented in two compact plastic boxes contained within a single well-designed cardboard container. Quite simply, this set is a mandatory acquisition for anyone who cares about film, especially at its absurdly cheap current price.

Powell and Pressburger collaborated on 22 films in all including 1 short (The Volunteer [1943]) and 2 as producers only (The Silver Fleet [1942] and The End of the River [1947]). That means this box contains 11 of their 19 features. Missing are The Spy in Black (1939), Contraband (1940), One of Our Aircraft is Missing (1942), The Small Back Room (1949), Gone to Earth (1950), The Elusive Pimpernel (1950), OhRosalinda!! (1955), and The Boy Who Turned Yellow (1972). Gloriously present though is the bulk of their best work produced between 1943 (The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp) and 1948 (The Red Shoes). The 4 films present here which lie outside this timeframe are perhaps less good (The Tales of Hoffmann a shining exception), but they are all well worth looking at nevertheless. 9 of the films were made under the umbrella of The Archers, the production company Powell and Pressburger set up to ensure complete creative freedom. The remaining 2 are 49th Parallel (made for Alexander Korda) and Theyre a Weird Mob made much later in Australia with Pressburger writing under the pseudonym Richard Imrie. This might seem an eccentric oddity on first watch, but even this rewards close viewing.

Now, how does one characterize the eclectic, extraordinary explosion of different elements contained within these wonderful films? Powell and Pressburger defy the apparatus of auteur criticism purely through the intensely collaborative nature of their work. Generally Pressburger would come up with the original story and then they would both work on the script (never in the same room). They would both act as producers, but Powell would do most of the directing with Pressburger always present on the studio floor in case of sudden re-writes. Pressburger would preside over the editing (his training as a violinist in Hungary helped him there) while Powell the showman would deal with the promotional side. Filmmaking is always a collaborative process of course, but where we can look into the personal lives of directors such as Mizoguchi Kenji, Robert Bresson, Andrey Tarkovsky and Carl Th. Dreyer and hook onto intensely personal themes that their films pursue closely, often obsessively, we search in vain for any such unifying worldview which we can ascribe to The Archers. Powell did make some films without Pressburger which revealed a lot about himself (The Edge of the World [1937] and Peeping Tom [1960] are two of them), but theres nothing in their joint ventures which suggests any kind of deep thematic consistency which lends itself to easy auteurist reduction. No wonder Truffaut (celebrated critic of Cahier du Cinma, the magazine responsible for the development of auteurism) dismissed them out of hand!

Despite the way The Archers appear to resist pigeon-holing, perhaps we can detect certain patterns that appear in their work. Just keeping to the films in this box we can break them down into groups. Clearly 49th Parallel, The Battle of the River Plate and Ill Met at Moonlight are all propaganda war films designed to boost the war effort and further rapprochement across international boundaries with lashings of the old stiff upper lip. All three are well made, well above average for their type, but they lack the idiosyncratic stylized passion for life which sears through the best of The Archers work. The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann (we could also add OhRosalinda!!, not included here) are about the relationship between life and the stage and are extraordinary riots of Romantic colour and emotion. A Canterbury Tale and I Know Where Im Going! are primarily I think romantic celebrations of the British countryside, the rolling hills of Kent in the former and the wild Scottish Highlands of the latter replete with stories of lovers finding each other across a nature which seethes with a mystical cultural heritage. The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and A Matter of Life and Death (in addition to the use of the same words in their titles) are in different ways historical love stories, the former cast as a story of lost love, but friendship gained; the latter cast as love found, lost and then found again across the great divide which showcases a kind of historical pageant set within the cosmos of time and space. Black Narcissus stands alone in this box, but Id pair it with the much later Peeping Tom, both stories being intensely Freudian and centered to extraordinary effect on sexual repression/obsession. In the first the subject is women cast as nuns in eternal denial of the real world from which they are in flight, while in the second the subject is the filmmaker (and film viewer) himself cast as pathologist psychotically obsessed with capturing (and watching) extreme pain and cruelty on film.

The one thing that exists in all these films, the one thematic which resonates the strongest for me, is a central dichotomy between reality and fantasy with the two constantly blended together in a fascinating variety of situations likewise built out of binary opposite combinations. In the world of The Archers at their best reality is often as fantastical as fantasy is realistic and we are never totally sure where we are and what exactly we are looking at. The most obvious illustration of this is A Matter of Life and Death where fantasy (Heaven) is depicted in b/w while reality (Earth) is depicted in glorious Technicolor where ones expectations would lead us to expect the opposite - where we expect to find reality we find fantasy and vice versa. In Black Narcissus the fantasy lies in the nuns in denial attempting to establish a convent in a harem (theres a binary opposite if ever there was one!) on top of a Himalayan mountain while the reality lies in the recollections of their repressed pasts brought back to them by the presence of the phallic Mr. Dean. Conversely, the reality of the convent is fantasy shot replete with stylized sets while their fantasies (their past recollections) are given the lush Gainsborough film treatment redolent of idealized reality. In The Red Shoes reality starts off as the real world of impresarios, ballet dancers and musicians with fantasy firmly fixed on stage for the performances, but as the love triangle escalates, the stage (the fantasy) becomes the reality for all three, or is it that reality becomes the fantasy? The reality of both A Canterbury Tale and I Know Where Im Going! has characters scurrying across the countryside in search of love only to bump into fantasy in the shape of something else entirely which makes them aware of the spirituality that surrounds them as the land literally comes alive with the ghosts of a rich national heritage. The fantastical lies embedded within the realistic just as the realistic disseminates the fantastic. When The Archers are at their best, this blend of reality and fantasy is intoxicating and sweeps all before it in a delicious and entirely irresistible torrent of delirious emotion. This is heightened by the extraordinarily rich visual textures offered by fantastic sets, lighting and exquisite use of colour. Nobody took to Technicolor as quickly as The Archers, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, A matter of Life and Death and Black Narcissus constituting the first truly great films made in the medium. Over 70 years on, in many ways their achievements still wait to be surpassed.

The main contextualizing event that hovers over most of the films here is World War Two and this taken together with the international flavour of the partnership (Pressburger was an Hungarian emigre) leads into another key Archers ingredient which also extends this binary contrast through highly literate scripts underlining and contrasting national stereotypes to endlessly fascinating (and often hilarious) degrees. In 49th Parallel stranded German U-boat sailors are contrasted with representatives of all the allies from the British, French, Canadian and American characters they meet as they traverse a continent. The Battle of the River Plate and Ill Met By Moonlight also contrasts Germans (distinguishing good Germans from the Nazis) with the British soldiers, demonstrating that absolute respect on both sides of the war will prevail as if war were a game of cricket. The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is centrally about a friendship between officers, one British and the other German, the latter stealing the love of the former, but with the friendship enduring nevertheless. In 1943 The Archers dared to show a good German much to Churchills chagrin, but history has shown who was right in the end. English/Scottish rivalry informs I Know Where Im Going! while playful banter between an English Land Girl, an English officer and an American army sergeant forms the background of A Canterbury Tale. Russia (a ballet impresario) vies with England (a composer) for the hand of an English rose (a prima donna) in The Red Shoes while A Matter of Life and Death features a veritable United Nations debate in Heaven with Anglo-American relations vying with Anglo-French relations for importance in a script riddled with hilarious jokes at every nations expense. The Black Narcissus of the films title is a perfume bought in a London Army & Navy Store by an Indian Prince who causes ruptures in (and causes the closure of) the convent when he runs off with a servant girl, an Anglo-Indian international relationship not destined for success (Indian Independence two years later probably wasn't coincidental!). Finally, Theyre a Weird Mob spends most of the time sending up Pommy-Ozzie relations with the central character an Italian immigrant fresh off the boat from Napoli and due for pratfalls galore in a lively series of visual and verbal gags. As bizarre and quaintly eccentric as anything in The Archers canon, the film sums up a career-long obsession with exploding national stereotypes.

Theres no doubting that at the base of every successful Archers production is a superb script, witty, imaginative, highly literary and bursting with life. This fundamental ingredient can be adduced to Powell and Pressburger alone. We must also acknowledge J. Arthur Rank and his influential chain of cinemas who assured them absolute artistic freedom. This was especially apparent when Rank stood firm against the government who tried to prevent The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp being shown. Rank sent the bureaucrats packing and opened the door to the masterpieces that followed. These films deployed the talents of many people who appeared repeatedly for The Archers. Freddy Young, Erwin Hillier, Jack Cardiff and Christopher Challis all shot two or more films for them. In fact Challis shot all of them from The Small Back Room on. Other omnipresent names are Alfred Junge and Hein Heckroth who were production designers on everything from Blimp through to OhRosalinda! Then theres the composer Brian Easdale who did the memorable music for both Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes while David Lean and Reginald Mills provided the bulk of the editing (especially Mills). The same actors also appear repeatedly and members of this stock company included Esmond Knight, Cyril Cusack, Ralph Richardson, David Farrar, Googie Withers, Marius Goring, Pamela Brown, Laurence Olivier, Roger Livesey, John Laurie, Anton Walbrook, Conrad Veidt, Deborah Kerr, Eric Portman, Finlay Currie, Kathleen Byron, Lonide Massine, Robert Helpmann and Valerie Hobson. Yes, The Archers was truly a collaborative enterprise, one that was unique in the history of film and one which we will never see the likes of again.

8140858,5,B000HRLWR6,"As fine a collection of British movies as you'll find, here are all the great classics from the Archers, the matchless directing/writing team of Powell and Pressburger. A round dozen films, each of them a gem of the skill and craft of film-making, each of them distinctive and exceptional in its look, its content and its style.

What was it that made Powell and Pressburger so special? It would be easy to dismiss films like A Canterbury Tale or I Know Where I'm Going as dated sentimental tosh. Yet they are both anything but - moving, involving, strong on characterisation, visually stunning and evoking an intense sense of place (Rural Kent in the former, the Western Isles in the latter). 49th Parallel? Just blatant propaganda! But then there are those stunning Canadian landscapes, the moving characterisations superbly acted by Anton Walbrook, Leslie Howard and, at the other extreme, Eric Portman. Are Ill Met by Moonlight and Battle of the River Plate just a couple more British War Movies, typical of their period? No, both take a different slant on their reality-based material. In Plate, for example, the big battle scene is over before 2/3 of the film is done and yet the potentially anticlimactic scenes in Montevideo harbour and the final scuttling of the pocket battleship are just as exciting, just as fulfilling an ending as any shoot-`em-up finale. What's Black Narcissus but a high-camp melodrama about nuns going potty with sexual frustration in the Himalayas? No, as a study of women isolated by climate, culture and celibacy as well as topography, it's masterly. (OK, Kathleen Byron in scarlet dress, a slash of lipstick across her mouth and rolling eyes is a bit OTT - but I wouldn't swap her for the world.)

Are these, then just comfortably and quintessentially British films? The truth is that there is much that is technically groundbreaking about their work. Kubrick's famous time-travelling jumpcut from bone to spaceship in 2001 was there a quarter of a century earlier in the cut from hawk to Spitfire in A Canterbury Tale. The integration of music and dance with narrative in The Red Shoes paved the way for much of Gene Kelly's best work, not least an American in Paris. Long before the days of CGI Powell and his technical team were conjuring magic on celluloid. Think of A Matter of Life and Death with its endless stairway to heaven or the amphitheatre court which is actually the Andromeda nebula - as well as all the tricks with colour, with freeze-frames and so on. The Himalayas of Black Narcissus are a glorious tribute to the masters of glass-painting and backdrops, to the imagination of set designers, to the physical skills of cameramen working with false-perspectives where an inch or two wrong on the camera can ruin the illusion - all shot on the soundstages of Pinewood!

They also brought out the best in their actors. One of Niven's finest pieces of acting (at least before Separate Tables) in Matter of Life and Death: the endearingly human Roger Livesey in I Know Where I'm Going, Matter of Life and Death, but most of all as the wonderfully real, deep, touching Candy in Colonel Blimp. Anton Walbrook, too, touchingly proud then frail in that film as well as the strong Amish leader of 49th Parallel and the driven impresario in The Red Shoes. Eric Portman, so capable of conveying the ambiguities of Colpeper as well as the certainties of a Nazi U-boat captain. Leslie Howard, Wendy Hiller, Deborah Kerr, Peter Finch, Marius Goring, Raymond Massey and so many others produced some of their best work under Powell's demanding direction.

No wonder the likes of Scorsese, de Palma and the rest rate Powell & Pressburger so highly and learnt so much from them. These elusive, tantalising, moving, talented men are worthy testimony to British movie-making at its best. My only gripe is that there wasn't room for The Small Back Room and especially Peeping Tom in this collection.",1287964800,10,3932,4.881736526946108
8140859,5,B000HRLWR6,"I have to confess that I have only seen most of the films. I really hate to put them in any category as they are actually in one of their own.  This is one of those times that you really want the whole set and do not care if the cost more or less as a set.

Emeric Pressburger was born on 05 December 1902, Miskolc, Austria-Hungary (now Hungary.) He was Educated at the Universities of Prague and Stuttgart.

Michael Latham Powell was born 30 September 1905, Bekesbourne, Kent, England, UK. He was educated at Kings School, Canterbury & Dulwich College.

Be sure to read my individual reviews for the various movies.  My personal favorite is ""I Know Where I'm Going!""

Be sure to add ""The Edge of the World"" (1938) Director: Michael Powell to this collection. There are good movies but this set is the core.

You need multi-region PAL/NTSC DVD player they are quite inexpensive nowadays and can expand your movie world. I am holding out for a time on the multi-region Blu-ray players for a little while.",1267920000,3,1003,4.538888888888889
