6612028,5,B00N5B5B3M,"Writer/Director Ira Sachs and writer Mauricio Zacharias have teamed together before (`Keep the Lights On') and have an understanding about same sex relationships. They have gathered a group of sensitive actors and address issues very much in the news today and do so in a manner that respects individuality and the universal problem of aging.

After nearly four decades together as partners, artist Ben (John Lithgow) and musician and music teacher George (Alfred Molina) get married in an idyllic wedding ceremony in lower Manhattan. But when George loses his teaching job in the parochial school because the Catholic Church cannot tolerate openly gay faculty, the couple must sell their apartment and - victims of the relentless New York City real estate market - temporarily live apart until they can find an affordable new home. While George moves in with two gay cops - Ted (Cheyenne Jackson) and Roberto (Manny Perez) who live down stairs, Ben lands in Brooklyn with his film director nephew (Darren Burrows), his author wife (Marisa Tomei), their temperamental teenage son Joey (Charlie Tahan) - with whom Ben shares a bunk bed - and his ever present friend Vlad (Eric Tabach). While struggling with the pain of separation, Ben and George are further challenged by the intergenerational tensions and capricious family dynamics of their new living arrangements. The influence George has on Joey's maturation is especially touching in the closing moments.

This is a strong work, gentle, understated, tender and beautifully acted film, but there is a serious problem with the sound track: the ever present piano music (mostly Chopin and well played)  as well as the ambient noise of New York covers the quiet dialogue, making us miss some of the exquisite lines the script offers. Still, this is a film that addresses the problems of same sex couples aging and the still present prejudices that hamper living a comfortable life.

6612029,3,B00N5B5B3M,"I give this film three stars for the splendid acting performances and for the good intentions. Basically, this is a modern remake of Leo McCarey's exquisite film, Make Way for Tomorrow, from 1937. In the earlier Depression-era film, an elderly couple loses their home and is separated from one another, each going to live with one of their grown, thankless children. In this version, it's a gay couple. One loses his job due to religious bigotry, and, consequently, they lose their home and are forced to stay in separate places, either with family or friends. (New York City's overpriced housing takes the place of the Depression in terms of a lack in rental space.) In short, the basic plot is the same.

The difference is that in the earlier film, McCarey stayed relentlessly focused on the aged couple and their timeless love for one another, whatever adversity each character faced. The result was emotionally devastating for period audiences. The sadness of this couple's condition hurt, initially, the film's box office. But since its first release, it has become an unqualified classic.

In this modern remake, the major focus on the central couple is sadly lacking. The writer and director are continually sidetracked into concentrating on secondary characters and their various problems. By not remaining fixated on this central couple at all times, the overall impact is sadly blunted by the movie's end.

Just to watch Alfred Molina and John Lithgow is worthy of a rental, but all ensemble performances deserve praise, which is a compliment to the director. The problems are within the screenplay itself.

As a postscript, I would add, who came with that horribly innocuous title?",1421366400,39,1692,5.075539568345324

6612031,1,B00N5B5B3M,"Based on the strength of the iTunes trailer and the 94& on Rotten Tomatoes, I bought this movie expecting a wonderful film with poignant and humorous moments adding up to a movie along the lines of the The Hundred Foot Journey or The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

Unfortunately, what we saw was a sweetly innocuous beginning with the marriage of Ben and George after being an unmarried gay couple for 39 years.  Set off from this spark of happiness is a slow (and I mean SLOW) moving, smoldering dung pile that just gets worse and worse.  Ben and George are the most likable characters in this movie and their moments together are the best 8 minutes in the movie; leaving another 90 minutes of pointless, miserable s***ty moments in the lives of people we don't care about or like...

The ending leaves more questions than answers and at the end; I wished I would have spent the time watching any other movie  but this one.  Horrible.",1420848000,13,933,4.590361445783133

6612079,4,B00N5B5B3M,"I fell in love with this movie for a number of reasons; because it's shot in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn and makes both areas look so lovely; the soft piano music of Chopin and Beethoven; and just because both John Lithgow and Alfred Molina did an amazing job portraying two old and mellow personalities who have been together for so long that their love just seems natural. (I'll admit a personal bias; my husband and I agree that I'm like Molina's character and he is like Lithgow, even though we're straight, and not quite as old yet.) There is the issue of Molina's character getting fired from teaching music at the Catholic school where he was known and accepted as a gay man (because marrying a man is a line he should not cross, apparently), yet he expresses so little anger at this injustice; more a sense of weary resignation.  It sets the plot in motion where the couple must live apart until they find a new apartment they can afford, and so we learn about their various friends and family members and their various quirks.  It shows a world where same-sex marriage is simply a normal part of life (except in some communities), but more importantly it shows what love and commitment look like after a long time has already gone by.  Simply beautiful.",1463788800,,1263,4.604444444444445

The church finds out and well....you see the rest. They have to sell their apartment since Alfred is unemployed and John is 72 years old. They have to stay with family and friends and separately still while they try to find a place. Why 4 stars? well, why not move out of NYC it is pricey. The end?

6612102,4,B00N5B5B3M,"The tone of Ira Sachs's movie remains resolutely liberal, as it calls for a ""live and let live"" attitude in a society which, despite its apparent freedom, nonetheless discriminates against certain people.

Long-time partners Ben Hull (John Lithgow), and George Garea (Alfred Molina) decide to marry after thirty-nine years of living together.  The ceremony is a happy one, but immediately leads to trouble as George is dismissed from his post at a local Catholic school as a music teacher.  Lacking sufficient funds to pay New York's ruinous taxes, the couple are forced out of their apartment after twenty years, and forced to live a nomadic existence.  Ben moves in with his nephew Eliot (Darren Burrows) and family, while George shacks up with friendly next-door neighbor Ted (Cheyenne Jackson).  The remainder of the film portrays the couple's struggle to survive under difficult, if not impossible circumstances.

Stylistically speaking, LOVE IS STRANGE is an elegaic movie, full of long takes focusing on the protagonists' expressions as they realize the shortcomings of their new lives.  The soundtrack with its plangent rendering of Chopin's piano music, reinforces the mood: in one sequence we see George giving a private lesson to one of his music students, and trying desperately to keep the tears back as he listens to her playing one of the Preludes.  Sachs's camera remains focused on his face, with occasional cuts to the young girl playing, and through this strategy we understand just how affecting music can actually be.

On the other hand Sachs celebrates the elderly couple's strength as they manage to overcome adversity and enjoy the pleasures of the moment, such as listening to a classical recital.  The camera zooms in on them listening, and their hands slowly meet in a mutual celebration of physical as well as emotional pleasure.  Another sequence, taking place in a diner at nighttime, shows the couple bidding farewell to one another; the camera shows them walking down the street together during a glorious sunset, their hands linked together; and subsequently cuts to an understated scene where they embrace.  This is the last time we see Ben alive - from then on George has to live the life of a singleton in a newly-rented apartment.

Molina and Lithgow give memorable performances - each gesture, or movement of the eyes signaling their longing for one another.  The other real star of this film is Christos Voudouris's camera, which photographs some wonderful New York landscapes in late summer and autumn; the skyscrapers towering into cloudless skies; the tree-lined streets offering oases of calm from the bustle of the main avenues; and the tracking shots of iconic sites such as the Metropolitan Museum.  From such moments we can understand precisely why George and Ben do not want to leave the center of the city, even though they have been offered temporary - and comfortable - accommodation in Poughkeepsie, two and a half hours' bus-ride away.

LOVE IS STRANGE might be at heart a sentimental movie, but remains memorable nonetheless - not only for the quality of the performances, but also for Sachs's cleverly understated direction.",1439769600,2,3179,5.119922630560929
6612103,5,B00N5B5B3M,"Lithgow can play anything.....He is the most versatile actor working today.  How he goes from ""Third Rock from the Sun"" to the serial killer in the ""Dexter"" mini-series to this astounds me.  His conviction and believability in this role is amazing.
Alfred Molina also surprised me.  I never saw him playing this type of role. I found him attractive and compelling.
The end of the movie was somewhat strange and anticlimactic for me.  I wanted them both to be happy, and live a while longer. But alas, relationships end sometimes because we physically give out.  When we're done....we're done.  End of story.",1439164800,3,607,4.901960784313726

It was a very strong character driven film with wonderful actors in the parts, but the director chose to leave out big chunks of the film.  Maybe others will disagree and it is not that we did not like the movie at all.  We just felt that there was too much left out.

The film only hints at political messages about homosexuality and the catholic Church or the economic safety net or rent in NYC. At the heart of this is simply couple who love each other and face trials spending time apart in a changing world.

They play Ben and George a gay couple who, after living together for nigh on forty years, decide to tie the knot. George though works for a faith school and once the Bishop hears of it he loses his job.

The couple can then no longer afford their Manhattan apartment and so have to ask their friends if they can live with them until they get sorted. However, we all know that hell is other people and even the people we love can be great only for a short time.

This is a very warm film, there are some lovely scenes, and Lithgow is, as always eminently excellent. The story though is a simple and gentle one and so that may give this film a feeling of being a bit light weight for some, but for me I often like a simple film. It is also a film that needs the `reveal' for impact and as such is not one that many will want to see too many times, as such will be one that is probably best to rent - either way you chose this is still one that fans of either Molina or Lithgow will be pleased to have seen.",1434672000,,1101,3.9107142857142856

6612200,4,B00N5B5B3M,"""Love is Strange"", co-written and directed by Ira Sachs (""Married Life"" & ""Keep the Lights On""), is the story of two gay men living in New York. When George  (Alfred Molina) and Ben (John Lithgow) marry, a loss of a job forces them to give up their apartment and separate until they can get back on their feet.

At first the viewer may come to expect the director to fall back on the usual tricks to gain sympathy. Yet soon into it, almost immediately (the day after the wedding), the viewer discovers that Sachs prefers reality to stapple Hollywood storytelling.

There are problems with ""Love is Strange"". The pacing  is slow, and often one feels like asking Sachs an obvious question, such as: Why don't the friends of Ben and George simply help them find a place of their own to live? In addition certain mysterious characters (such as Vlad) have been carelessly introduced into the film and start to create false impressions and expectations.

The soundtrack of ""Love is Strange"" is equally puzzling. It is dominated by Chopin preludes and waltzes. The effect, once played in the background is not the same as traditional music in film, which generally sets mood and develops pacing. Instead, and this why it works, it hangs in the background and is more like the unrelated rambles of George's state of mind.

One of the great strengths of this film, however, is that it never sentimentalizes or plays on the viewers emotional response. Early on we see George is fired from his job at a Catholic school for making his marriage to Ben public. Even after Ben writes to the families of his students, we get no clumsy attempt at justice. Rather like life George walks away from his employment with far more grace and Christian love than his employer has dealt to him. Ben is equally portrayed without any of the bitterness or irony that might be expected. There is a delightful scene between Ben and Kate (Marisa Tomei) in which Ben keeps prattling on while  Kate is trying to finish a book that she is writing. And like all characters in the film we get the feeling Sachs is saying to us: ""What did you expect? A happy ending?""

The reality of Sachs' approach turns ""Love is Strange"" into a sweet, if not redeeming story. While there are minor flaws to be found, it would be a greater loss to focus on them. Like life itself, no one hangs about to explain it.",1426550400,,2361,4.59144893111639

6612202,3,B00N5B5B3M,"Two of filmdom's best actors, John Lithgow and Alfred Molina, star in this heartfelt drama of a gay couple of 39 years finally getting a chance to marry in New York.  While all seems to be well, George (Molina) is a musical instructor at a Catholic school.  And while the school's principal, Father Raymond (John Cullum), the staff, the parents and the students are all aware of George's gender preference and living arrangement, the formality of the recent coupling results in his getting fired after 12 years.  So now they have to make ends meet with private tutoring and Ben's (Lithgow) social security.  It isn't enough so the men ask if they can move in with relatives.

Ben moves in with his nephew, Elliot (Darren E. Burrows), his wife (Marisa Tomei) and their teen son, Joey (Charlie Tahan).  This is NYC so everything is small.  Ben actually bunks in Joey's room.  Yeah, he's not happy.  Nor is Kate (Tomei) who is a stay-at-home novelist.  George finds a home with his nephew, Ted (Cheyenne Jackson) and his gay partner, Roberto (Manny Perez).  They are both cops who like to party in their home.  And although, they accept George, they don't alter anything about their lifestyle.

Both Ben and especially George are uncomfortable and unhappy.  Not only are they apart for the first time, they feel they are intruding.  Unfortunately that's about it as a story line.  Lithgow and Molina are terrific as they try to forge a new life apart.  But I kept wondering why George isn't more aggressive in looking for a new job.  And while they don't want to leave the vibrancy of the city, they were both welcome at Ben's niece's house in upstate Poughkeepsie.

There really isn't much of a story here, other than to highlight a social injustice and provide a stage for some fine performances.  The film is somewhat saved by a tangential story involving Joey and his friendship with a Russian emigree named Vlad (Eric Tabach).  Joey has a nice scene at the end of the film that almost makes the whole movie worthwhile.  Otherwise, I found the film trying to find a purpose.

The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While there is nothing offensive about the look of the film, it does appear flaccid most of the time.  There are a few scenes shot from the rooftop where Ben paints a portrait of Vlad with the city in the background that is very sharp and colorful.  I didn't watch the DVD version of this movie, but I would guess that this Blu ray isn't a big step up.  The audio track comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it is fine if unspectacular.  Not surprising as this is a dialog centric film.  Again nothing noteworthy for or against.  It is clear and accurate but you won't find much going on in the surrounds.  Subtitles are available in French and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with writer/director Ira Sachs, Lithgow and Molina, a ""making of"" short, a Q & A with the actors and director, a trailer and the usual previews (Sony).",1426464000,,3003,4.618147448015123

It really tells the story of moving in with people who don't really want you around.

This film was never labeled as a comedy, and despite some humorous moments regarding simple human foibles, it is a sad, melancholic tale of an older couple in love, faced with a family dilemma. I haven't seen a film lately about so many loving characters that was so depressing.

6612330,4,B00N5B5B3M,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

In my opinion, one of writer/director Ira Sach's goals in bringing us his films, is to emphasize that most gay people are part of the mainstream--that a person's sexuality should have nothing to do with his worth as a human being. Indeed, Sach's protagonists, Ben and George, in his new touching feature, ""Love Is Strange,"" are the epitome of pillars of the community. The middle-aged couple have been together for 39 years and now we see them at the beginning of the film, loved by a coterie of friends and family, at their wedding.

Ironically, it's the decision to get married, that leads to the complications of film's second act. George, a vocal teacher, was tolerated at the parochial school where he was employed for many years. But the public nature of the marriage did not sit well with the archdiocese who discreetly ordered his termination.

Without the second income, Ben and George are forced to sell their apartment. Since they only lived there for about five years, they had little equity to begin with. After a co-op ""flip tax,"" taxes and other charges, the couple is left with about $17,000, hardly enough to afford purchasing a big enough apartment to live in. Now they're forced to split up while waiting to find a next to impossible low income apartment or get on a waiting list for elderly applicants.

Ben moves in with his nephew Eliot, his wife Kate and teenage son, Joey. George moves in downstairs with two younger gay police officers. George's story is not as compellingly drawn--his main problem is trying to tolerate the younger hosts' penchants for late night parties.

Ben's sojourn at the nephew's is much more interesting. He clashes with Kate, who has trouble with his desire to chat while she's attempting to finish her next novel. More dramatic is the clash with Joey, who becomes resentful when Ben begins using his best friend Vlad as a model for his next painting, up on the roof. Things come to a head when Joey accuses Ben of being ""so gay."" Ben, in his wisdom, doesn't take it personally--recognizing that it's the immature comment coming from a teenager placed in a stressful situation.

Andrew O'Hehir, writing in ""Salon,"" cogently observes that Ben and George still have much to offer despite being interlopers: ""I would argue that the true subject of ""Love Is Strange"" is the way Ben and George, even faced with an upsetting and unexpected life crisis, can still serve as mentors and role models to all the younger people around them, even when the younger people barely notice them, or find them irritating. It isn't always, or even usually, the big moments that change our lives, the ones we consciously pay attention to as they happen."" When Ben asks Joey while lying in their respective bunk beds, whether he's ever loved anyone, he helps the confused teenager focus on what eventually will be a factor in his recovery from teenage rebellion and alienation.

O'Hehir notes a similar mentoring quality to George's interactions with younger people: ""the entire film hinges on a scene when George listens to a young female student play a Chopin nocturne. She plays it once, he offers some critical feedback, and she plays it again. We can tell from George's response that he has been captured by the music and goes through his own private reflection, his own transports of joy or grief. We never know what he's feeling and thinking, but in the most important sense we don't need to - what Chopin's music, and Sachs' film, is making us feel and think is what matters.""

Nathalie Atkinson, of ""The Globe and Mail,"" finds Sachs' oeuvre to be ""quietly observational - the film's emotional power coming from its rich but unshowy performances, like George...standing in the kitchen sipping soup while yet another party rages in his makeshift bedroom before traveling in a rainstorm to seek brief but necessary solace with Ben.""

After the deep despair at the end of the second act where Ben and George see no end to their separation, the third act, where George meets a man who has a low income apartment available--this represents the road back to equilibrium.

Nonetheless, Sachs saves his most powerful moment for the denouement. Instead of building up to Ben's death, he shows the aftermath. We're past the tears and have arrived at acceptance, as George wistfully speaks of Ben to a now chastened Joey who we see last with his new girlfriend--the very person Ben counseled Joey to seek out earlier.

Sachs has now entered the mainstream with a film about a gay couple where the focus is hardly about their sexuality but rather an all encompassing humanity. Lithgow and Molina are perfect as the beleaguered couple who appear as multi-dimensional characters. ""Love Is Strange"" is low-key but pretty much a gem all the same.",1424476800,13,4810,4.839416058394161

Suddenly you are transformed to a different time with no reason.  What upset me the most was the ending.  I won't give it away for other moviegoers but it appears that one of the leads had another gig and vanished from the story.  The conclusion of the movie is unrewarding and confusing.

I was puzzled, too, by the amount of time and focus spent upon the peripheral characters, many of whom had no clear purpose or relevant roles to play in the lives of these two men or in the progression of the story itself; the gay male couple and the sister who lived upstate, for instance, were merely distractions.  One of the major storylines, involving the grand-nephew, was also a bit muddled in its intent and focus.  I relished the scenes between the two men but they were few and far between and, although I found it worth watching, I'm more disappointed than not that it didn't realize its massive potential.",1423440000,,768,4.708955223880597
6612372,4,B00N5B5B3M,"LOVE IS STRANGE is an interesting film, and one that will probably turn off a lot of viewers once they know what the concept is, but I thought it was a sweet portrayal of an aging couple who just happen to be gay. Alfred Molina and John Lithgow play Ben and George, a recently married couple who have been partners for 39 years. However, once Ben's employer finds out about his marriage (he is the music teacher at a Catholic school), he loses his job and the couple are forced to sell their apartment because they can't afford it anymore. In the meantime while they look for a new apartment, they have to live separately with family and friends. And therein lies the trouble: they haven't been apart in all those years of living together, and the film explores how it affects them emotionally as well as the people they stay with.

 While watching this I tried to keep the title at the front of my mind at all times, but I still don't know quite how it might strictly apply. The closest thing I can come up with is George's nephew's family, who George ends up staying with. On the one hand, you have this aging couple who haven't been apart a day in their lives together who are now forced to be apart through circumstance; but then you have George's nephew and his wife who live in the same house with their son, and yet each of them feels separated from the other by the way they live their lives. George's nephew is a film producer who has long days away from home, while his wife (played by Marisa Tomei) is a writer who spends most of her time at home trying to write. And on top of that, their son keeps to himself a lot and spends most of his time with Vlad, his only friend at school. The general sense, or message, I got from the film is that it takes losing something to appreciate its true value.

Still, whatever it was all supposed to add up to I thought that the performances were excellent. I haven't seen John Lithgow and Alfred Molina this good in years, and they were very believable as a couple who had been together for so long. Marisa Tomei also did great work as George's nephew's wife. I should also mention the soundtrack composed mostly of Chopin, which I really loved. My favorite piece was the ""Raindrop"" prelude which plays a few times during the film, and my favorite use of it was during a private piano lesson that Ben gives to one of his students. I also appreciated the nods to Ben's religious faith, which never came into conflict with his personal life. Last, but not least, the cinematography and cityscape shots were extremely beautiful.

 Still, there is one thing which lessens the film's impact in my opinion, and it has to do with the film's ending (of which I won't spoil the details). All I will say is that it feels more like an epilogue in the sense that there is a time jump (and something else) which came completely out of nowhere. It almost felt like they weren't quite sure how to wrap up the film, so they jumped ahead in an effort to give the story some closure. I didn't hate the ending, but I felt that maybe a different ending would have been just as good, possibly better. Still, I liked the film overall. It was a sweet indie drama that felt like a slice of life. On a side note, it kind of makes me never want to live in New York.",1423440000,3,3289,4.3241491085899515
6612373,5,B00N5B5B3M,"The beauty of a film like Love is Strange is that it says so much without appearing to say a whole lot.  I know that that sounds, off the bat, like a criticism of sorts, but it really isnt.  This is a film that rests very easy, never forcing any of the films narrative themes, but gently coaxing from them so much depth that we don't even realize what it is we are taking in, but we are taking it in.  While our focal point is centered on the unfair situation that newlyweds Ben and George find themselves in, so many little, subtle things are floating around the surface and popping up for our interpretation and contemplation.

Prejudice, aging, respect, infidelity, economy, grief; all of these things are explored in subtle ways, sometimes in just a passing comment, but are fully represented when considering the context.

Love is Strange (which by the way is a confused film title, since it says nothing about the film itself), tells the story of same-sex partners Ben and George, and opens on the day of their marriage.  Theyve been together for a VERY long time, but are finally able to legalize their bond.  Unfortunately, legalizing their love has brought George to an uncomfortable spot with his employer, a Christian School that has strict rules about the image of their teachers (hes a piano teacher).  Despite knowing full well about Georges relationship with Ben, having a wedding placed the school in a position where they felt the need to let him go.  Now, this happy couple finds themselves financially strapped, and with the rising cost of housing in New York they are at a loss for where to go.  They settle on the decision to live separately, Ben moving in with his nephew and his family, and George sleeping on a friends couch.  Separation is bad enough, but living with other people poses its own set of hardships.

A story like Love is Strange moves briskly, and with no real seeming purpose, but it is in all the little details that the purpose of the film is firmly implanted.  In the way that Bens family tends to take him for granted, or the way that Ben feels a need to defend his nephews son, or the way that George subtly deflects temptation, or the way that Ben and George nonchalantly discuss previous indiscretions; all of this background noise (because, its never given center attention) completes a picture of life and love in all of its stages.

And the ensemble is just beautiful, with Lithgow and Molina turning into such rich and honest portraits of these men, and the rest of the cast, most notably Marisa Tomei (one of the greatest character actresses working today, or ever) rounding out a very natural and impressionable ensemble.

Some have balked that the lack of central focus on Ben and George TOGETHER has dampened the impact of the film, especially the finale, but for me it was the way the focus was spread throughout the entire family that this films finale found its sharpest impact.  The film, by spreading the focus, delivers a real insightful look at the way the elderly are regarded and nearly disregarded in the same breath, and the way that respect can be lost without reason and then slowly developed, almost unbeknownst to us and not until its too late.  Yes, this is about an unwavering love between two people (and yes, this deals with prejudice and the debilitating economy) but the ending note is the lasting impression made by the development of family and what that really means.",1423180800,,3446,4.678807947019868

SPOLIER: I think the part where Lithgow reveals the serial cheating takes away from their romance and love story.

I'm not sorry I watched, but found it rather boring and inconsequential. The background music, mostly Chopin, was soporific and occasionally interfered.

6612395,3,B00N5B5B3M,"Here we have a long-time couple, 40 years, who finally get married. Problem is, George, who is teaching at a Catholic school, is fired as a result. The school always knew he was gay, but his marriage is a public declaration and they can't keep him on the payroll. The first thing that happens is that they are forced to sell their apartment. Unexpected fees and service charges leave them with far less money than they expect.

Director Ira Sachs working from a script he co-wrote with Mauricio Zacharias (""Keep the Lights On"") shows us the turbulent results of a life-altering event like this when a couple is no longer young.

His cast includes:
  * Alfred Molina (""Chocolat"") is George, suddenly unemployed, now dependent for any income from a few music students. Housing in New York City being what it is, some neighbors, a couple of policemen, offer to put him up on their couch (they don't have room for two).
  * John Lithgow (""Interstellar"") is Ben, a moderately successful painter who has his work in a few galleries. He opts to room with his nephew and his family in Brooklyn. He gets a bottom bunk.
  * Marisa Tomei (""Spare Parts"") gives by far the most nuanced performance. As Kate, an author married to Ben's nephew, she shows marvelously controlled exasperation: she is trying to finish her next book but Ben blithely interrupts her over and over.
  * Charlie Tahan (""Blue Jasmine"") Joey has to share his bedroom with his dad's Uncle Ben and finds the loss of privacy infuriating.
  * Cheyenne Jackson (""Beyond the Candelabra"") Ted is half of the couple who offers their couch to George. Watch him try to explain ""Game of Thrones"" to George.

Of course, our two lead actors, each married for decades, bring a personal authenticity to their roles that other actors would only hope for. My major problem is with the script: It just feels too contrived. Of course there are moments, as I mentioned earlier, Marisa Tomei is wonderful, but this one left me strangely unmoved.",1422316800,,1984,4.732558139534884

6612403,4,B00N5B5B3M,"Ira Sachs' Love Is Strange focuses on George and Ben (played by Alfred Molina and John Lithgow, respectively), a same-sex couple of 39 years. George is a music teacher at a Catholic school in Manhattan and despite his sexuality being well-known and accepted by his students and colleagues, his archdiocese fires him from the program once he and Ben decide to tie the knot. The film concerns the aftermath of the archdiocese's decision and how the couple learns to cope with financial instability--and more importantly, time apart after decades of being so close.

Sachs' film is so moving and so touching in its depiction of how relationships can evolve and devolve, even after several decades. It's completely rooted in the issues of our time, but the sense of social consciousness here never feels sermonizing or political. It's a small film, but a smart and subtle one as well, bolstered considerably by the lead performances. The film is not perfect; some of the supporting characters are not as well-developed as they perhaps could have been, and a subplot involving stolen books is completely superfluous, but when the film works (which it does fairly consistently), it really works and manages to be moving without ever feeling manipulative or false.",1421712000,,1257,5.072463768115942
