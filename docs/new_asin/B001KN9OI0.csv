8315481,2,B001KN9OI0,"I can only assume that each person's body has a very individual response to gout. My trial and error approach using diet to treat gout has led me to being a reluctant vegetarian, often vegan. This book offed recipes that I wouldn't dream of eating with gout and some that I wouldn't eat at anytime. For example making margarine out of canola oil and butter! Canola oil is not good for us to begin with. Perhaps the info in the book is merely out of date. Too bad as I was hoping for inspiration.",1454284800,,495,4.276595744680851
