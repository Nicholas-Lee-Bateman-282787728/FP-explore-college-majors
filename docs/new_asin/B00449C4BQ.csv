4260298,3,B00449C4BQ,"There are scenes I love: some of the dog training, one dog helping another, dogs recovering the loot, the English bulldog, gasoline at ~37 cents a gallon, the final ending. And scenes I don't like that are very disturbing: dogs attacking/biting people, dogs and children being whipped with leash. Although the doberman breed was unfairly characterized, it was ultimately shown that the breed is not as described. The dobermans, the boy, the dobermans, the English bulldog, the dobermans, I would watch it again, and again just to see my favorite scenes if I could remove the violent ones I find so objectionable. The story lines have great potential for, as I say in the review title, a 'Disney' movie. These movies are not for children, but they could have been.",1300838400,5,763,4.876923076923077

4260300,5,B00449C4BQ,The DVD's are in good shape. This is an old film and the people's mouth and the words are right together in sync.  What I am most pleased with is one of the DVD's would not play and it was not difficult to contact Amazon and I was given clear directions as to how to proceed.  My return order was processed quickly and i was refunded my return postage.  It was easy to do business with them.,1299628800,2,391,4.0519480519480515

I knew that Doberman dogs were very intelligent, but these movies showed me that they really are very intelligent!  Mind you, not because of the stories we see in the movies, but because of the training of these animals that was required to accomplish these productions! These movies are a testament to these fine intelligent animals and their abilities to perform in hectic movie settings!  Enjoy the films!",1513036800,3,532,4.824175824175824

4260384,3,B00449C4BQ,"In many ways, these are rather BAD movies.  First off, the acting in both the original and the sequel can be rather stiff.  Secondly, if I were a parent today, I might not want my kids seeing a movie that has one-night stands and other less child-friendly attitudes towards the reading of porno magazines (""Oui"" is being read by one of the crooks in ""The Amazing Dobermans"").  The main reason I was somewhat disappointed by this movie was simple:  Too much time spent on people, not enough time spent on the dogs.

When the focus is on the dogs and the humans who love and handle them, much of the film is as good as I remember from when I was a 7-year-old boy.  When the film focuses on the humans, I recall how parents were uneasy about this movie from the start.  Someone on this board suggested that the movie might be ripe for a Disney remake.  I'm intrigued and curious as to what should or might be cleaned-up.  The plot has to be about dogs being trained for a heist (not, normally, an ethical thing to do): the first film is about a bank heist; the second is about the stealing of illegal campaign funds.  There's much potential, but as the originals show, there are many ways to mess it up.  Still, I have a fondness for these films.  Amazingly, a fine and more-than-competent Alan Silvestri did the music for both.  He latter did the music for ""Forrest Gump"" and many other good soundtracks.

4260386,2,B00449C4BQ,"""The doggonist gang that the world had ever seen...""

At dinner one night, my father-in-law saw a Doberman on TV and asked if I had ever seen the movie where Dobermans rob a bank. I hadn't...but knew from that description alone that I had to track it down.

It was released in 1972, directed by Byron Chudnow. Chudnow only directed four movies in his career...The Doberman Gang, The Daring Dobermans, The Amazing Dobermans, and Alex and the Doberman Gang. Pretty safe to say that this guy had an unhealthy obsession with these dogs. It stars TV journeyman actor Byron Mabe, Hal Reed and Julie Parrish, none of whom you've ever heard of.

The story revolves around an ex-con named Eddie and his desire to rob a bank without the element of 'human error' once a bank job goes wrong. To do this, he and a dog trainer snag a pack of Dobermans and train them to rob a bank using whistles. Sound crazy? It is. It really is.

The premise of this movie sounds a bit better than it actually is. What we actually get is about 10 minutes of set up, an hour of dog training, and a ten minute heist. A bunch of character decisions make no sense, none more than the fact that Eddie is about the least careful criminal one could be. He pulls a waitress that he's known for one night into the job because...well...sex, and when the dog trainer threatens to bolt, he basically lets him. He flat out deserves to get caught. At least the 70's music is 'groovy', featuring a song about the dogs that just classic(ly bad).

I cannot recommend seeing The Doberman Gang. The only thing redeeming about this thing is the music and watching a bulldog try to run the doberman course.",1421712000,,1656,4.452145214521452

4260412,4,B00449C4BQ,"Who doesn't remember these two 70's cult TV movies. As a little girl I always gravitated towards the beautiful doberman pincher,and I remember every time these movies were on tv, my mom always knew where I was. As an adult now, and still have the love for dogs, I also have  strong feelings for a really good movie along with great acting, these movies  don't have either. The stories are really out of left field. The actors clearly were expelled from acting class,if attended at all. With all this being said, the dogs are unbelievably amazing. Everyone dog lover or not have an appreciation for a well trained dog. Also every DVD collector has at least a handful of cult classic movies,and they probably are not on any Oscar or Emmy list. But  they have always been your favorites, fun to watch,that's why we have them. These two movies are no different. Every movie buff at one time or more root for the bad guy, in this case the bad guys are bank robbing dobermans,in the second movie it picks right up where everyone is trying to catch these dobermans with satchel full of $$$ . I apologize for this review, reviewing these dvd's has me reminiscing about tv viewing as a child. WOW am I old. I have said before that movie reviews is always a very personal opinion. Everyone's taste is different. Anyone who does enjoy these types of 70's movies might also be interested in the movie ""TRAPPED"" about a divorced father trapped in a department store at night with 5 or 6 trained guard dogs,starring James Brolin.

4260414,3,B00449C4BQ,"Shipment was fast and timely, but there was a problem with the first movie (""The Doberman Gang""): at ~ 8:30 minutes into the movie, it freezes and can't be reset without ejecting the disc.  I have no less than four dedicated (ie not on a pc) DVD players in the house, and the disc froze in exactly the same spot on each one of them.  The second movie, ""The Daring Dobermans"" played fine. Therefore, I give the functional disc a ""5"" and the dysfunctional one a ""0"" with an average of 2.5, rounding up for the fast shipping!",1393200000,,522,4.316326530612245

4260448,4,B00449C4BQ,"I bought this movie recently because it caused me to adore Dobermans back when I was 12 years old during the 1970's when this movie came out.  Since then, I have had a Doberman in my entire life to date.  If you like Dobermans or maybe even just dogs, you will enjoy the Doberman Gang in spite of it being a 1970's film.  The Daring Dobermans is much of the same, but the script is not written as well.  My 8 year old son truly enjoyed both movies.  The movie shows how intelligent and obedient Dobermans are; unfortunately, it also provides the false allusion Dobermans are vicious and will turn on owners thus a false reputation which the breed has had to prove not to be true over the years.  Did you know Dobi's are rated #4 on the intelligence list for dogs?",1344384000,4,763,4.300699300699301

4260450,1,B00449C4BQ,"I got this double feature for my boyfriend as a stocking stuffer. Boy oh boy, did we have a laugh over these... The movies are boring and ugly, reminiscent of everything that the '70s pooped out, and should not be taken seriously. The only redeeming feature of the features are the fact that they include Dobermans, but I wish there was more barkin' and less larkin' because both ""films"" make me want to chase my tail in frustration.",1331424000,,433,4.564102564102564
4260451,5,B00449C4BQ,"I am a Doberman Breeder in Washington State, and I think that this movie shows how capable these WONDERFUL creatures are. Although, Dobermans aren't as mean as they are made out to be in the movie, This is definitely one of my favorite Doberman movies!

The dog training scenes were awesome and the way one dog stopped to help another was amazing.  The writer really did a good job in coming up with a new and unique way to rob a bank using the dogs.  These movies would be a good candidate for a modern remake.,1314662400,5,397,4.116883116883117
4260458,5,B00449C4BQ,"Wow!! Finally! The Doberman Gang and The Daring Dobermans are on DVD, and together in one package! Tired of the old VHS tapes from the '80s? Get this great package. The only downside to this two disc release is: it is not ""pressed "" from Warner Brothers. It was made by Warner Brothers and burned on a DVD-R (the purple bottom gives it away) and contains no documentaries on the making of these two films. That is a minor quibble, since I have been waiting years for these to be released on a digital format (DVD) and in anamorphic widescreen (1.78) for the first time on home video.
The quality of the prints are pretty good for early '70s films. Still don't know if ""burning"" or ""pressing"" would help with the video looking amazing. After watching poor versions of these over the years, this DVD set IS a sight for sore eyes! Why these films aren't made like regular DVDs with special features is beyond me. They don't make G-rated action movies like these anymore! Got this for about $15 and to me, that's a steal for this double feature. May be corny for some, for me it brings me back to why I like movies in the first place.",1313625600,17,1130,4.385714285714286

I am 47 now and seen the Dobermans when I was kid,so I got this movie for my son and yet we all settled in and watched it. Fun movie and the entire family can watch it.

If you own a Doberman it will be even better as Dobes are very smart and not the mean dog they are made out to be.
