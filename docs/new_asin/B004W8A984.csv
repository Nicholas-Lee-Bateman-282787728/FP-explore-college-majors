8471826,5,B004W8A984,"This is a very comprehensive set of dvds on the story of El Bulli, the trend-setting restaurant north of Barcelona. A lot of interesting documentary footage, interviews with the original owners and some of the many chefs who worked there. It is in Spanish, but it is region free so should play on most dvd players and computers. The restaurant closed at the end of 2011, though it may be back in some form in a couple of years. Ferran Adria and company (and others of course) revolutionized restaurant dining both in terms of food and presentation and the influence of El Bulli has been felt worldwide. While you will probably not be able to eat at the restaurant (Ferran is talking about reopening as a kind of food institute and not a restaurant per se), there are many restaurants in the US carrying on the experimental dining which began here.",1329436800,,847,4.6158940397351
