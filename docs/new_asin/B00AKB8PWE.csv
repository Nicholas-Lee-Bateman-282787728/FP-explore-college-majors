5445103,4,B00AKB8PWE,"Hello,

  I enjoyed watching this movie. It has lots of exciting good action. I enjoy Bruce Lee movies. Great to see a movie filmed in Asia.",1397001600,,140,4.3076923076923075
5445104,1,B00AKB8PWE,"Cannot believe Shout! Factory would do injustice to Bruce Lee and his fans. The two films on this disc only have English (5.1 or 2.0) and NO Cantonese language!! Maybe most people like watching people's mouths move and the words don't follow the mouths, but I don't! Cannot believe it does not state English dub on the cover. Most foreign films are offered in their original language (at least as one of the choices). This is worse than I remember growing up and watching Kung Fu Theater on TV. At least get the dubbing half right. You get sounds inserted when they shouldn't be there! Laughably bad!! Even the sound effects are bad. These look to be the same prints from years ago in the Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (except the soundtracks). This is horrible, to say the least. Ten bucks gone to waste! Wonder if the blu ray imports are as bad? His Hong Kong films need to stay just that. Foreign films. Why do Americans have to ruin a good thing? I will stick with my old DVDs that are in their original languages until something better comes along.",1367280000,9,1053,4.518324607329843
5445105,2,B00AKB8PWE,Great movies but I really don't see the reason to release them once again on DVD. And I personally don't like this cheap two on one dvd thing. Fans here in north America have been waiting for the release of the Bruce Lee movies on blu ray for years. I purchased the Japanese Bruce Lee blu rays released by paramount pictures & the picture is great compared to dvd & considering their age. The latest Japanese blu rays released 2012/11/09 have English soundtracks (no English subtitles) & are region A same as north America.,1365206400,3,523,4.574468085106383

5445117,1,B00AKB8PWE,"This DVD was a waste of money. The picture quality is bad, but the sound quality is truly awful. It's so terrible that I tried to turn on subtitles because I couldn't hear the dialog well enough to follow the story. But there are no subtitles! No subtitles, no bonus features, awful picture quality and terrible sound quality.

The movies are actually pretty good. Watching Bruce Lee is fun and his charisma is undeniable. I will buy better versions of these movies. But save yourself the money and skip this DVD set. It's not even worth giving away.",1503360000,2,550,4.612244897959184
5445118,1,B00AKB8PWE,There is added background music that wasn't in the original  and it is a distraction.  I can't enjoy this copy.  Sending it back.,1502323200,2,129,4.521739130434782

5445123,5,B00AKB8PWE,"Bruce Lee was the greatest! These are the two movies that brought him world wide notoriety and recognized him as the ""master"" of martial arts.  No matter what people testify as to his cause of death, I question his untimely death. There have been too many lies given for the deaths of many people and I do not listen to the lies of the media. Too many people profited from his death and then there was the untimely death of his son, Brandon.",1491177600,,441,4.313253012048193
5445124,4,B00AKB8PWE,"Bruce Lee took his philosophy and unique brand of martial arts to the world through Hong Kong theatre and became an international action superstar with these two films!

5445178,2,B00AKB8PWE,"The English audio track sounds way too cheep and terrible. I watch the first 30 minutes of ""The Big Boss"", before I stopped the DVD, because the sound effects that they added really stand out from the rest of the film. They make the movie look too cheesy. If only they could release the original Mandarin Chinese version on DVD, with no added sound effects, just completely unaltered. Dose anybody know if there's a DVD or Blu-Ray release with the original Mandarin Chinese mono track?",1437782400,,485,4.7176470588235295
