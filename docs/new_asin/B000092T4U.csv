7988683,5,B000092T4U,I like David Morse and he was perfect for this roll. This movie makes you stop and think about the sacrifices a priest makes to help others.,1353801600,,140,4.222222222222222
7988684,4,B000092T4U,"This movie has such an ""indie"" feel.  David Morse is a chameleon and does a fantastic job with his work, no matter what the part.  Gives a realistic view of the priest and the city.  I gravitate towards this type of movie as opposed to the ""normal"" Hollywood type.  Photography was excellent; it really set the mood.  The movie was thought-provoking and I enjoyed it.",1254960000,2,367,4.584615384615384
7988685,5,B000092T4U,"I can relate to this sort of spiritual man--see this!  I don't care if you are religious, spiritual or otherwise...find your heart.",1210204800,,131,4.954545454545454
7988686,5,B000092T4U,"I love this movie. I love its flow.
The everyday life and struggle of a priest in the urban ghetto and his resulting doubts about faith are portrayed with fine humor and in rather an unobtrusive manner. There is no exaggerated drama here. It's the ordinariness that leaves a deep impression.
David Morse in the part of the priest is brilliant of course. His performance alone makes watching ""Diary ..."" worthwhile.",1203206400,5,414,4.845070422535211

7988688,5,B000092T4U,"Few movies attack, I mean literally attack, the heart as much as this.  Toward the end I had pushed myself deep in the couch.  Not as much in comfort, but in trying to get away from the work and struggle this man faced and recognizing the work he did was not as extraordinary as one might believe.

David Morse in his understated, simplistic, utterly powerful portrayal reminded me that McNamee's acts were the most basic responsibilities of the Christian faith.

This movie will cause a reexamination of priorities.  Please don't watch it without looking inside yourself.",1131321600,5,572,4.916666666666667
