4483019,5,B004VLONA2,"I bought this movie to help my then-8th grade son with a school project on John Muir. We were both very impressed with the thoroughness of the storytelling and the cinematography.  Since then, I have used the film to introduce 5th graders to John Muir. It has been well worth the money spent.",1361923200,2,292,4.509433962264151
4483020,4,B004VLONA2,"It was an in-depth look at the life of John Muir, who was an amazing man and did so much for conservation efforts in the US.",1355184000,,124,3.8076923076923075
4483021,5,B004VLONA2,"This is an excellent ""documentary"" about the life and accomplishments of John Muir, one of the most important people in the conservation movement. This is not a pure documentary, but rather an enactment based on his history.",1354060800,,224,5.081081081081081
4483022,5,B004VLONA2,This is defiantly for someone whom is a nature lover or whom really enjoys learning about the laws of nature or history. John Muir is the BEST one to learn and enjoy this quest from -- he is long gone now however he will always be remembered as father Sequoia.,1351468800,,260,4.22
4483023,5,B004VLONA2,"This DVD is the perfect addition to the video library of anyone who cherishes our environment and National Parks.  It is inspiring to learn about a man who was concerned about preserving the natural beauty of our country without going to ""wacko"" extremes to do it.  This gentle man, foreign born, lived in and loved this country by example. Having watched Ken Burns ""National Parks"" series on PBS and learning about John Muir, gave this DVD instant credibility. John Muir was on to something and when we Americans learn what he said and did, you can't help but say, ""I'm for that too!"" And, I am - enjoy this DVD with your family, it's a real colorful treat for everyone.",1327881600,7,671,4.583333333333333
4483024,5,B004VLONA2,"This is an enlightening DVD.  It could not possibly delve as deep as a book, but in the time-frame alloted, it sure covers a lot of territory. I've been a lifelong John Muir fan, yet I learned some interesting details about his life in this DVD that I had not previously known.  The filming itself is beautiful, and the actor chosen to play Muir looks so much like the man himself that one cannot help but be awed.  I recommend this addition to the video library of anyone who honors the works of Muir and/or who is a lover of nature.  For a deeper study, I recommend the book ""The Wilderness World of John Muir.""",1321315200,13,613,4.304347826086956
4483025,5,B004VLONA2,"As a John Muir fan, I bought the DVD without question and watched it almost as soon as I received it.  It will not disappoint, very well put together. I was very impressed, was glad to add it to my collection.",1316563200,8,209,4.097560975609756

8443534,4,B004VLONA2,"I enjoyed this book a lot.  Just the feeling of being there, remembering my own trips to Yosemite & experiencing what John Muir experienced was very interesting.  I just wish I knew the names of more of the plants he talks about.  I always wondered if he encountered any Grizzly bears in Yosemite.  He did!",1476144000,,306,4.509090909090909
8443535,5,B004VLONA2,"This biographical presentation is also a syllabus of America's development from coast to coast. Though a somewhat amateurish production,
it has a pervasive sweetness that evokes interest in the USA's 'natural' metamorphosis. Muir's compelling devotion to nature has preserved
much of the wonders we treasure. Would recommend for family viewing.",1470096000,,344,5.9

8443542,5,B004VLONA2,"Much like the man, this documentary was informative, beautiful, and inspiring. The locations shown for the reenactments make it easy to understand Muir's passion and respect for nature, and his desire for others to connect with it as he did. What a great debt we owe to him and other kindred spirits for seeing wild areas of the U.S. preserved through the creation of our national parks, and the video has a nice section explaining the role others like Robert Underwood Johnson and Theodore Roosevelt shared in this.

The film covers Muir's life from childhood to the end, explains how each phase prepared him for the next, points out the influences of the people in his life, and ultimately culminates in the legacy Muir left behind.

With its coverage of the Hetch Hetchy Valley damming, the documentary touches on the fight against commodification and exploitation of nature, which continues today. In spite of this setback, Muir's story is an inspiring one of hope and a beautiful example of how one man can influence the character of a country.

Narration, acting, scenery, presentation- all top notch. Watching this was a fantastic way to spend the evening.",1374364800,2,1163,4.953846153846154
