7902561,4,B000003K8P,"This is one of my favourite Klingon episodes from any of the Star Trek series.  The show gives some great insight into the Klingon culture.  Suspecting that Gowron, leader of the Klingon empire is a Changling, Sisko, Odo, Chief O'Brien and Worf go undercover to expose him and terminate his control by whatever means possible.  Prior to leaving DS9, Sisko, Odo, and O'Brien are transformed into Klingons by the skills of cosmetic reconstruction and venture off to embrace their destiny.  I do wish this was on single issue DVD rather than VHS but it is still good.",1265155200,,564,4.783505154639175
7902562,3,B000003K8P,"First of all, this is a good Klingon episode, and really gives some insight into the Klingon culture. Unfortunately, there are a few inconsistencies that really punch holes in the episode. First, Worf is a part of the infiltration team. Worf?! Any Klingon that has the slightest sense of current events in the galaxy would've been able to recognize him in an instant, even without the little goatee. The writers thought it would make sense to include Worf, since he's Klingon, and it does at first, but if one takes into account how he sided with the Federation in ""The Way of the Warrior"" Worf makes a very poor choice for this mission. He could've easily taught Sisko and the others how to act like Klingons aboard the station. Secondly, the Martok changeling seems to recognize O'brien out of the four. Why O'brien?? True, there may have been brief meetings between the two in the past, but would it not have made more sense for Odo to be the first person the changeling recognizes? Or Worf for that matter? Finally, at the end, Odo tries to warn the others about Martok while fighting with the changeling. Odo is actually able to hold off the shapeshifter by wrestling with him and throwing him against the wall a few times. In fact, Odo is actually able to somehow escape the changeling before the fighting starts to try to warn Sisko and the others. Didn't the changeling have Odo at gunpoint? And isn't Odo a humanoid now? And hasn't it been proven that changelings have far greater strength than normal humanoids? Yet Odo seems to give the changeling a good whipping. Finally, the changeling acts like a changeling and throws Odo down and whips out his arm to strangle him. Why didn't the changeling just break Odo's neck? And if he were a truly resourceful changeling, why didn't he just throw himself up into the vents in the ceiling before being shot by the disruptors, like the changeling did in ""The Adversary""? All in all, this episode is a fair one, brought down by plot holes due to writer amnesia involving past events in the series.",1090195200,,2050,4.650137741046832
7902563,4,B000003K8P,"Klingons are fun.  And whenever an episode of Star Trek focuses on Klingons, we know we are in for a great ride (""The Sword of Kahless"" not withstanding)!
Odo is convinced that Chancellor Gowron, leader of the Klingon Empire, is a changeling.  Odo, Sisko, Worf and O'Brien set out to reveal the truth by disguising themselves as Klingons.  It is highly entertaining to see our heroes try to make it as Klingons.  Oddly enough, Sisko seems the most at ease as a Klingon, not Worf.  Worf, being an outcast (for the second time--does this guy want to fit in?!?), is in greater peril, though.
I admit it, part of the charm of this episode is seeing Colm Meaney (O'Brien), Rene Auberjonois (Odo) and Avery Brooks (Sisko) dressed up as Klingons.  Odo and O'Brien, as Klingons, look extremely dorky.  But Sisko--my oh my!  Does he wear that Klingon make-up well!
Their is an interesting plot twist at the end of the episode.  It seems Odo's information about a changeling disguised as Chancellor Gowron was only half right...
Anyway, this is a good, solid episode.  It isn't essential for Klingon lovers, but it comes close.",991267200,,1117,4.740932642487047
7902564,2,B000003K8P,"This was the first episode of the terrible season five of Deep Space Nine which featured Sisko, O'Brien and Odo dressed up as Klingon's and trying to  infiltrate the Klingon homeworld (does this remind you of the Next Gen  episdoe Reunification or what?) and expose Gowron as a Changeling. The plot  is slow and clumsy, and although the ending is revealing this is not what  you come to expect from a season opener. No action. Everone goes home happy  but a pointless war between the Klingon's and Starfleet still remains at  the end of it the simple question is WHY? Hell Sisko and crew practically  save the Klingon Empire in this episode but nothing comes out of it. Any  way, terrible, buy Way of the Warrior or Call to Arms!",966729600,,729,4.553846153846154
7902565,5,B000003K8P,"Apocalypse Rising is another of the great Klingon episodes. This episode has Sisko, Worf, O'Brien and Odo posing as Klingon Warriors about to be inducted into ""The Order of the BatleH."" They are on a convert  mission to try and expose Chancellor Gowron as a Changling. This episode  generates tension and intrique as our heroes try to expose Gowron and are  discovered for who they really are.  One of the best episodes of DS9 and  the beginning of a great story arc that carries through until the end of  the series.",964224000,2,517,4.626373626373627
