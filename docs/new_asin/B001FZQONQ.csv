3589711,5,B001FZQONQ,"MONTEVERDI'S ""FABLE IN MUSIC"" DISPLAYS THE POWER OF MUSIC!
Even after three centuries, the music of Claudio Monteverdi glows with the passionate genius of a musical prophet.  He was far ahead of his day in his conception of music as a dramatic, expressive art, and in the realization of that conception. The score of 'L'Orfeo', first printed in 1609, records the event of its first performance at the Mantuan court in 1607. A unique aspect of the score is its wealth of information about the deployment of the 'continuo orchestra'.  It is this combination - the human voice of Orfeo and the 'heavenly lyre' which accompanies him- which established opera as an art form that continues to fascinate us today. But beyond the enchantments of Orfeo's 'heavenly lyre', is the immediacy and truth of his human voice that rivets our attention and moves our hearts.

The opera begins with the character La Musica, the allegorical embodiment of music, presents herself to the princely company and announces a drama in which the power of music will occupy the center of the stage; it is the story of Orpheus, who conquered the Underworld with his lyre and his singing.  As this 'fable in music'(as Monteverdi called it) unfolds, we are exposed to the whole gamut of human emotions, from the most euphoric to the most dejected, presented in musical language that is perhaps closer to impassioned speech than recitative has ever been, before or since.

The story of Orpheus has been done and redone by many composers through the centuries, although it remains essentially the same; Orfeo's beloved Euridice dies and Orpheus goes into the Underworld to find her. He is escorted there by La Speranza (Hope), who leaves him at the gates of the Underworld to be met by Charon, the boatman who ferries him, (albeit while sleeping) across the river to the realm of Pluto, where he pleads for Euridice's life.  Moved by the singer's Lament, Proserpine, Pluto's wife, convinces Pluto to allow Orpheus to take Euridice back, but with the stipulation that if he looks back at her,she will return to Death. (what a silly stipulation!).  And, of course he looks back and he loses her permanently. But in this version Monteverdi chooses to have Apollo, the father of Orpheus,  come down and invite his son to ascend with him into Heaven, where he will know joy and peace forever.  Not bad, I say! (I like Gluck's verson better, in which Orpheus gets another chance and he succeeds in getting her back.)

The main cast of singers are:  Orfeo (John Mark Ainsley), Euridice (Jaunita Lascarro), La Messagiera (Brigitte Balleys), Apollo (Russel Smythe), La Musica (David Cordier), La Speranza (Michael Chance), and Caronte (Mario Luperi).  All acquit themselves skillfully with good characterizations, but why not, they are mostly all experienced in this genre.  The accompanying instrumtal group Tragicomedia, also experienced in this area of music, perform neatly and accurately.  The choral group Concerto Palatine provide spirited choral renditions throughout the opera.

Intense and refined performances by an inspired cast, led by a profound and commanding John Mark Ainsley as the legendary tragic musician, are sustained with fluent ease and obvious affection by the ensemble under the direction of Stephen Stubbs.

The beautifully styled, evocative stage production, rich with Pierre Audi's trademark, symbolism (I personally love his staging!), accentuates the solemn serenity of Monteverdi's most famous work to create a moving and timeless audio-visual experience.

Sung in Italian with English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Dutch subtitles.  There is an illustrated synopsis, cast gallery, introduction to the opera,and interviews with Stephen Stubbs, Pierre Audi and John Mark Ainsley.",1241222400,33,3776,5.1927512355848435
3589712,5,B001FZQONQ,"This production of L'Orfeo is set in the ducal palace of Mantua, where the opera was first staged in 1607.  You might think of it as 21st century traditional.  Although less static and stage-bound than the classic Harnoncourt version, it hews closely to the original story and settings.  Director Pier Luigi Pizzi trusts Monteverdi's conception and feels no need to update it, although he adds some modern touches.  The result is what Fanfare's reviewer calls ""the best stage set, the best costumes, the best lighting, and the best camerawork"" seen in this opera.  (The shift in Act 3 to largely black costumes, which another Amazon reviewer questions, clearly reflects the change in location from earth to the underworld.)

William Christie provides superb direction to his period band, Les Arts Florissants, and an excellent cast.  Dietrich Henschel is a fine Orfeo.  Maria Grazia Schiavo shines in the three roles of Euridice, La Musica, and Prosperpina.  And the other cast members are strong as well.

L'Orfeo is generally referred to as the first true opera.  This fine DVD demonstrates how it has lost none of its appeal over more than 400 years.  It is one of the best available recordings of a baroque opera -- or of any opera.",1302825600,3,1236,4.917874396135265
3589713,5,B001FZQONQ,"This great production takes us back to the baroque and it is a great pleasure to see the first opera ever. The singers, the costumes, the music and the extraordinary Jordi Savall gave away one of the best performances I've ever seen.",1287964800,4,233,4.571428571428571
3589714,5,B001FZQONQ,"It's appropriate that what is often considered the first opera - or at least the first opera that we can recognise as being more closely associated with the form of the opera as it is widely known today - is a composition in praise of Orpheus and his golden lyre.  Written in 1607, bringing together music and drama into an integrated form for the first time, Monteverdi's L'Orfeo seems to delight in the very essence of the resultant new artform that has been created, the alchemy of music, drama and exquisite singing achieving an almost transcendentally beautiful balance and harmony.

Dealing moreover with the legendary subject of Orpheus, Monteverdi's opera finds a perfect subject to demonstrate the power of the artform, one that can take in subjects as large as life, death, love and art and truly do justice to their importance in the lives of ordinary people.  Set in the meadows, hills and woodlands of Thrace, life is simple but hard for the workers in the fields, but Orpheus through his music is able to transform the misery of the people into a thing of beauty.  But he ""who once made sighs his food and tears his drink"", has since discovered happiness in his love for Eurydice.  The happiness is short-lived however, as Eurydice is bitten by a snake and dies.  Grief-stricken, Orpheus descends to the underworld, to bargain with Charon, cross the River Styx and claim her back from Hades for the living.

A mythological subject, there is poetry and wisdom scattered throughout the gorgeous libretto, warning mortals not to ""put your faith in fleeting fragile joy that is so soon gone"" observing how often in life ""we are lifted high only to be cast down"".  The music (the story appropriately is introduced by the muse Music herself) and the singing all combining to give the subject and tragedy the necessary emotional depth.  The 1997 production recorded here makes good use of the vast stage of the Muziektheater in Amsterdam, Pierre Audi's staging at the same time simple but effective.  The tone of the period instruments and singing are impeccable, John Mark Ainsley's voice conveying the warmth, lyricism, charm and beauty that you would expect Orpheus to possess.

Released on DVD by Opus Arte as a 2-disc set, the 16:9 enhanced image is excellent, even in the dim lighting showing detail only slightly less impressive than a HD presentation.  There are two audio tracks.  The DTS 5.1 is a little echoing, although it does give the opera an appropriate cathedral quality, but the PCM stereo track seems to my ears to have much better depth and clarity.  Neither can do much about the sometimes heavy clumping that is made by figures striding across the stage, but this is a minor irritation.  The extras are brief but useful, including a Synopsis and a 16 minute introduction that looks behind the scenes at the production and the instruments used.",1282608000,8,2872,4.844580777096114
3589715,5,B001FZQONQ,"What a show!  This thing called ""opera"" might just catch on if performers take this kind of attitude towards it.  This DVD more than any other demonstrates the difference between ""historically informed"" and ""academician dictated"".

Deflo's production is genius.

Savall... what can you say.  Brilliant musician, leader, scholar, and showman.",1279065600,2,341,5.74
3589716,5,B001FZQONQ,"This is the first of the several Monteverdi opera productions on DVD that I purchased to familiarize myself with this pioneer of opera. Since I cannot compare it with others, for that reason, I write only of my response as an untutored opera viewer to others similarly situated.
It is a static performance. Considerable emotion is contained within the confines of ritualistically defined motion. Seemingly it is traditional-style in which song and music expresses towering feeling with limited externalization in gesture.
Scenic design was simple but an extremely effective complement to song and physical expression. Lighting was also quite first rate, creating a suitable mood for a drama of love found, love struggled for, love lost. Costume, too, enhanced the traditional mode while creating a flow of color and intensification of setting effectively enhancing the patterns within which the action took place. No question but that I found the staging design and interaction with the performers physical presence quite first rate.
While limited in physicality, the actor-singers seemed to me to be giving us an excellent version of what Monteverdi might mean to us today. High marks were earned by all the singers, with the lead providing strong underpinnings, to understanding Orfeo's character. Supporting players were no less impressive. Simply as a personal, not objective comment, I found the bass voice of the character guarding the entrance to Hell, particularly appealing. This was a bass which hit those deeper regions without a tremor.
In sum, I cannot say that you will like this production, but it does seem to me a very good way to experience an extremely important work and to explore the profound message the composer sought to communicate.",1269388800,8,1758,5.259786476868327
3589717,5,B001FZQONQ,This DVD is a wonderful production and highly recommended to those people who love early music and in particular the Savall family and orcchestra of talented musicians.,1261612800,3,168,5.2592592592592595
3589718,3,B001FZQONQ,"Just a different opinion here;concerning to singing this production is really disapointing in comparison to others Orfeos options available. Henschel,a singer I always like a lot,great singing from Bach to Strauss,gives here a really rough and unpleasant leader role`s portrait;no poetry or delicacy at all,just a huge deception to watch his gross performance. That Messagiera is a so completely terrible actress that seems to me a old fashioned soap opera TV decaying lady since her very first bars to time she leaves the stage;it was such a relief that Monteverdi stopped the part at that point but unfortunally her poor sense of taste returns like La Speranza;however I agree her singing works better here since mezzos can be more impressive than countertenors on this part. Proserpina/Musica has a childish voice to compete to powerful Bernarda Fink or even Juanita Lascarro on previous dvds. Despite all this weak cast,it was a huge pleasure to eyes and ears to see the musicians most of time on this production;I enjoy and loved that a lot. Set and costumes are just ok(beautiful Caronte`s boat),except that so poor Apolo;maybe financial crisis ruined Madri Royal Theatre;no shoes and a beggar`s red bath towel just to the God of the Sun,the worse Apolo voice I ever heard. IMHO,in case you are looking for a first class Orfeo,you must to go to John Mark Ainsley/Netherlands Opera,best rendition so far,or the older Harnoncourt`s lavish production.",1260835200,5,1454,5.165254237288136
3589719,4,B001FZQONQ,"I want to apologize, in advance, for this lengthy review.  I normally try to keep things a bit more concise but I have several issues with the production and I'm hoping someone far more erudite than myself will help me out. That said, there's always a great many positive things to be said about any project that involves William Christie and this is certainly no exception.  This production of Monterverdi's L'Orfeo (a co-production between Teatro Real Madrid and La Fenice) is in many ways typical of the metamorphosis (some might say decimation) baroque opera is currently experiencing around the world but mainly in Europe; productions somewhat ambiguous as to what they ultimately wish to be.  I'll break down the review into two sections:  Production and performance.  With respect to the former - there are some aspects that work rather well, including a very dramatic opening of the Prologue, with the entire set rising up from the center of the stage; a deliberately paced ascent accompanied by the rolling of drums, then the soft, warm glow of torches bathing everything around it in orange.  Like a mammoth dollhouse, the set expands and unfolds, revealing staircases and arched corridors, and we find ourselves in an elegant courtyard (supposedly the Ducal Palace of Mantua), Les Sacqueboutiers de Toulouse center stage playing the Toccata that serves as the prelude to the opera.  Musica enters and the spectacle begins and it does so in fine fashion.  The costumes are an elegant but simple variation of 17th century interpretation of ancient Greek attire; not overly fussy with garments in solid colors and everyone barefoot.  The orchestra, including Christie, in turn, are dressed in late 16th, early 17th century attire.  Dark colors and ruffled collars.  I loved the contrast and it certainly created a sense of time and place.  The orchestra is visible throughout the entire performance and was something that I felt worked very well, indeed.  I'm not familiar with the Teatro Real's stage, so I'm not certain if the stage was divided in two, with the rear portion elevated to create the illusion or if the orchestra pit was simply raised, not that it even matters.  It was a clever concept that paid off  in spades.  So far, so good.  This is the case for the first two acts.  Acts 3, 4 and 5 take on a more contemporary feel that left me somewhat perplexed.  Orfeo descends into the underworld to try to win back his beloved Euridice.  Everyone is now dressed in contemporary black attire (orchestra included).  In fact, Orfeo looks like he's been dressed by Ermenegildo Zegna; however, still barefooted.  Odd but no biggie.  Caronte stands atop not a barge, ferry or other water vessel but rather a large wagon, pale bodies surrounding him and propping himself up with, guess what, an oar!  It's an illogical step in direction.  Caronte departs and the spirits enter and they're covered in sheer white sheets from head to toe.  It's jarring not to mention a bit comical.  There's some choreography involved but it doesn't amount to much.  No doubt both director and designer were striving for innovation but what they ended up with was really something so uninspired that it verged on the insipid.  Enter Pluto and Proserpina, the former atop a four poster bed and the latter joins him soon thereafter.  Mythology tells us they're married but what's the purpose of the bed?  Is it to emphasize the human in the divine and imply that theirs is a relationship with a carnal aspect?  Perhaps, who knows but I found it another useless dramatic device.  Needless to state that among the spirits is Euridice and when Orfeo reneges on his promise to Proserpina and pulls off the veil to reveal his beloved, it's so anticlimactic that it renders the moment downright dull.  The final act finds us back at the Mantuan court, with Apollo, in modified period costume, asking his son, Orfeo, to join him in blessed, immortal life in Heaven.  The opera ends with much rejoicing  with the chorus and dancers jumping about barefooted in their fitting black garments.  There are even a couple of dancers who attempt to channel the late, great MJ and moonwalk across the stage (rather poorly mind you), more reveling and then the stage goes black.  When it was over, I didn't know what to think.  I wasn't even sure of what it was I had seen.  I don't mind modern dress productions of baroque operas (or any opera for that matter) but this seemed to want to straddle both the conservative and the modern without doing justice to either.  It over reached and didn't really say much.  Now on to the performances.  Absolutely no complaints.  Christie's direction was taut, dramatic and wholly convincing.  It was elegant and controlled.  His love of and respect for the score was evident at every moment and his band, Les Arts Florissants, responded accordingly.  Dietrich Henschel's Orfeo was a thing of dignified beauty.  He  knows this character well and seemingly sympathizes with him.  The same is true of Maria Grazia Schiavo's Euridice (and Proserpina/Musica).  Sonia Prima's facial expression can seem a bit overwrought but her dramatic instincts and vocal delivery were wonderful.  Luigi di Donato's Caronte was a bit a on the light side and therefore lacking in menace but he delivered a nuanced and elegant performance as Caronte.  Agustin Prunell-Friend's Apollo is a work in progress.  Though musically correct, it was a somewhat insecure voice lacking in focus and refinement.  The Pluto of Antonio Abete was of the tried and true variety considering that he sang mostly prostrate.  The minor roles were sung beautifully.  Special mention goes to countertenors Xavier Sabata and Cyril Auvity, who were excellent. The chorus was spot on and was hampered only at times by the ill conceived costumes and direction of Pier Luigi Pizzi.  From a musical perspective, this L'Orfeo is very special, indeed; however, from a visual point of view, it's a mixed bag of equal parts of good and bad.  I don't think anyone will take offense to Mr. Pizzi's ideas but I also don't think he has done much to elevate the work to new heights.",1259712000,9,6139,4.89815712900097
3589720,5,B001FZQONQ,"A nice performance, and you can turn off captions.

I used to do homework to Helmut Krebs' Arkiv version long ago (recently rereleased on CD), and more or less know every note.  Some of the note digressions here are actually interesting ones, eg. lute bridges, etc.

The video gives a from to what had just been regular music until now.

This is actually the only opera I like; although it's more early music than opera.",1252540800,,420,4.56
3589721,5,B001FZQONQ,"I am so sick and tired of baroque operas, performed by crackerjack period orchestras and stellar singers, married to ridiculous modernist and postmodernist stagings. Am I the only one who can't abide the disjunct? Baroque opera (recitative-aria-recitative-aria with the occasional duet, dance, or chorus) works because the music is designed to be paired with lavish stagings and opulent costumes. The theatrical aesthetic paradigm of the 17th and 18th centuries was one of whimsy, of fantasy, of color and ""suspension of disbelief.""
So tremendous kudos to the present production for its colorful and appropriately whimsical staging and costuming -- the mythological Greeks *look* like mythological Greeks, not, oh, Vietnam War combatants or Bronx junkies.

And the music?  Maestro Savall has produced another winner. The orchestra is as fine as it ever is under his direction, and the vocal cast is without fault -- the weakest link may in fact be Caronte, whose tone is a bit shallow and whose full-face mask muffles some of the fine basso writing Monteverdi provided.

Highly recommended.",1250640000,29,1090,5.362573099415204

One reviewer thinks these singers  do not have great voicers; and wonders about people who admire this performance. How long have they been seeing opera and how many great voices have they heard?  For me the answer is since 1957 and the first ""great"" voices I remember hearing were those of M. Delmonico, R. Tebaldi and L Warren in Othello.  I don't remember how many there have been since then.  More recently it seems to me that  seeing a new production always carries the risk of what we might see on the stage (e.g. Wotan as a Wall Street banker) and worse to come.

I regret this purchase and do not recommend it unless you're new to opera and can't tell a mediocre voice from an outstanding one.

8303248,5,B001FZQONQ,"... this review would be a lot simpler to write. There'd be nothing negative to say. Scarcely even a quibble about singers or orchestra. Musically, this is as 'big' and exuberant a performance as historical insight could allow.  William Christie's ""Les Arts Florissants"" includes the usual contingent of bowed strings, flutes and dulcian, but the basso continuo features three theorbos, viola da gamba, violone, organ/harpsichord/regal, a very prominent harp, and the rare lirone (a bowed instrument with a plethora of strings), and there are percussionists in the pit as well. Then, on stage and in the pit there are the five trombones and two cornetti/trumpets of Les Sacqueboutiers de Toulouse! The chorus, who are sometimes of the cast of shepherds/spirits and sometimes galants of the Mantuan court observing the opera from onstage seats, includes 18 singers! That's a humongous musical assemblage, one that would have been extravagant at any occasion in 17th Century Italy, and one that would be unmanageable for a lesser conductor than Christie. Any orchestration of ""Orfeo"" requires a lot of extrapolation and speculation, and most productions choose discretion as the better part of valor. But it's positively THRILLING to hear Monteverdi's music rendered MAGNIFICENT by such a virtuosic orchestra.

And the singers in the roles of the drama? Also superb, and superbly recorded! Maria Grazia Schiavo sings three roles: La Musica in the prologue, Euridice, and Proserpina. If you know the opera well, you'll realize that Euridice is the smallest role of the three. Schiavo brings a different affect to all three personae, being gorgeously warm as La Musica and plaintive as Poserpina. Sonia Prina sings both La Messaggera and La Speranza, with the best of her low register most impressive in the latter role. The four shepherds, roles that w provided the musical highlights in some older Orfeo productions, are slightly overshadowed in this extravaganza of instruments, but they're certainly still delightful. Basso Luigi De Donato is gloriously orotund as Charonte, and Basso Antonio Abete is as grim and stern, both in presence and in voice, as the role of Plutone demands.

But the whole show depends on one singer, Orfeo, who sings nearly half of the whole libretto. Baritone Dietrich Henschel will, I suspect, attract some divided opinions from listeners. Viewers will have no problem admiring his stage presence; he's a manly, resolute Orfeo who fails himself at that one crucial moment. His vocal timbre, however, may not please all; his voice is more dramatic than beautiful, dare I say more German than Italian? The contrast is startling when Apollo descends to the stage in the final scene; Agustin Prunell-Friend has the lyrical 'sprezzatura' tenor timbre that Monteverdi virtually invented in his music. Henschel's artistry is in his technique, his astounding control of breathing and phrasing, of dynamics and variety of timbres, and his confident, consummate ornamentation. The musical highlight of this production is Henschel's singing of Orfeo's plea for the pity of Charonte. Much of what you will hear is 'improvisatory', not improvised on  the spot of course but not straightforwardly notated in any source. Henschel draws the most delicacy and elegance his voice can produce from his trills and 'goat trills', his diminutions and arpeggiaturas. In effect, he slows the whole robust, celebratory opera down to a single passionate outcry. To put it in slang, ""he goes about as far as he can go.""

Now for the staging: Honestly, there are two stagings -- Prologue and Acts 1/2 before intermission and Acts3/4/5 after -- and whether the starkly different concepts of the two make dramatic sense will totally depend on the viewers willingness to accept such a contrast. The first half is costumed and acted as a historical recreation of a performance in the courtyard of a late Renaissance palazzo. It's a rowdy, colorful wedding party, with a permeable line between the singers and their aristocratic patrons, who sit on stage. The orchestra is also costumed -- Bill Christie wears a ruff! -- and in full view, and dramatis personae move freely from stage to pit. Opera-lovers who prefer 'traditional' visual grandeur will adore this first half of the production.

After that intermission, however, the orchestra returns in somber black street clothing, Orfeo appears in the same bluntly modern garb, and the whole staging turns abstract and somewhat modernistic. Charonte's ferry is a boat on a wagon, loaded with 'naked' corpses en route to Hades. Proserpina pleads for Orfeo in her nightgown to a Plutone also in bed clothes, in a bed center-stage. The spirits of the dead are draped in simple white sheets, like kids playing ghosts for Halloween. Whether it's the visual 'let down' of this staging, or the musical let down of the fourth act after the passionate intensity of Orfeo's extended heart-rending in act three, acts four and five seem, to me anyway, oddly sketchy and anti-climactic.

There are no less than five DVDs of Orfeo on the market these days. And who can complain about such an embarrassment of riches! The oldest production, Harnoncourt's, has the virtue of being the pioneering achievement in staging early Baroque opera for a modern audience; it's lavish to the point of distraction, but musically it's painfully crude. The singing is awkward, often poorly tuned, and uninformed in its ornamentation. The orchestra is 'primitive' by current standards. The Barcelona production, conducted by Jordi Savall, has assorted problems that add up to my dissatisfaction. The Rene Jacobs version must have been quite splendid in the theater but it's poorly filmed. The production from Amsterdam -- stage-directed by Pierre Audi and musically directed by Stephen Stubbs -- is so markedly different from this newer production that it might be a separate opera entirely. Where this Madrid production is half spectacle and half symbolist minimalism, the Amsterdam staging is consistently spare, pellucid, spiritualized, timeless and mythic. The musical forces are far smaller -- just the delicate continuo of 'Tragicomedia' and the restrained elegance of ""Concerto Palatino"" on cornetti and trombones. Frankly, I relished the mythic serenity of the Amsterdam Orfeo, and I miss that conceptual unity in this splendid but inchoate Madrid production. Here's an possible insight: I thought, while watching it, that the Madrid Orfeo had included portions of the opera left out from the Amsterdam production, i.e. that it was longer. In fact, the Madrid DVD runs only 113 minutes, while the Amsterdam DVD is 140 minutes. I'll need to peek at the score, but subjectively I wonder whether the sketchiness of Madrid's Act Four could be a result of cuts.

Bottom Line? You'll be more than glad to have both productions, Madrid/Christie and Amsterdam/Stubbs.",1317254400,5,6883,5.23956442831216
