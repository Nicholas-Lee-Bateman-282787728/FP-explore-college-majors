8663850,5,B00L5KOSJI,"Unlike the first reviewer, I actually watched the DVD (several times actually).  This DVD is hands down the best instructional film I've ever seen on the Lo Shu ""Magic Square.""  The instructor, Shane, takes a topic that is usually presented as mystical and mysterious and teaches it in an easy to understand fashion.  He links the square with the trigrams from the I-Ching to present a fully functional diagnostic and healing system.  I've been using the material from the film and I can testify that it's incredibly powerful.  I can't wait for Volume 3!",1426723200,,554,4.851063829787234
