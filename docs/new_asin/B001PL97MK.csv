8333650,4,B001PL97MK,This is a historically interesting time in europe when scores were being settled and bad choices were coming home to roost. While i found it difficult to sympathise with the main characters as people it does illustrate the less than sqeaky clean dispensation of justice at the end of the war when victims needed to punish those who had lorded it over them during the fascist era. Therefore the film was a very interesting depiction of these times and the  issue of justice vs expediency. A worthwhile if slightly depressing movie,1408924800,,529,4.813186813186813
8333651,5,B001PL97MK,"I have love all the other Giordana movies you can find. The neorealistic feel of the movie makes one think about the greats like DeSica, Passolini, Rossellini, the greats of Italian movie making. Then one realizes that along with Nanni Moretti here is another great modern Italian filmmaker that doesn't bend reality and rules to make a fluffy film. The filmmaker's observing of Italian
history in his various movies inspires a new neorealism that is polished and greatly executed.",1338854400,,481,5.10126582278481
