7373556,3,B013TYXUSM,"I grew up watching the Classic Doctor Who from the 1970's with Tom Baker, Peter Davison, &  Sylvester McCoy during the early to mid 1980's with my mom on Local PBS on Sunday Nights
So I'm not trashing this Blu-Ray 3-D to be mean, rude or a troll
I'm a legit real Doctor Who Fan (Classic, and the Re-Boo)
The season 8 ending epic first go with Peter Capaldi as the new Doctor is a beautiful disaster
Mostly due to the unbalanced writing of show runner Steven Moffat
Since he has taken the helm he has got major hate though out the years from many hardcore Dr Who Fans
Which i never picked up on until this season started to wind down

This two part season closer Dark Water & Death in Heaven is a brilliant idea that never fully lives up to it's potential
and if you didn't watch the complete season from the start most of it woun't make much sense to you
Jenna Coleman is a great fit in every possible way even though there was no real point in writing the character of
Danny Pink he was only created as a plot device and to build up to this two part finally to  sacrifice as a Cyberman  and that's stupid and lazy and I understand why so many fans loath Steven Moffat!  Cause he doesn't care what the fans think he's ego is bigger then the Tardis.
Peter Capaldi picks up where Matt Smith left off dare i say it he's much better
He might look like a older gentleman but, his performance is really interesting at times you'd think he was a toddler or a teenager
(He's a New but, very old Dr. he a combination of  Tom Baker, David Tennant,  Christopher Eccleston, William Hartnell)
All the actors and actress do a bang-up job through-out the season 8 it's just the poor writing in areas that make me scratch my head!
The Idea behind all this is straight-up brilliant......
It dealt with death is there a after life? Is there a soul? is there a heaven?
But, instead of dragging out this very cool idea they just let it slip out of there hands and made it a cheap typical sci fi nonsense
Missy played by(Michelle Gomez) who's been collecting various dead (aliens, robots, etc. from the start of the season) which you wouldn't know if you only view this stand alone release is The Doctor's longtime friend turned  nemesis  The Master!!!
Awesome casting Michelle is hands down perfect and brings so much to the character in the short time you have her on screen!
A great example the writing sucks there should've been some kind of strange love thing between the two because it would make more sense
The two balance each other out logically (but, why do that it might make sense!)
The heaven idea was a old Scooby Doo plot the master seen on tv and mixed it up with dead souls and cybermen
Visually this was just flat out cool having Cybermen clawing out of Graves (But, this was done in a little film called Return of the Living Dead) So it's Not in any way original but, it very good for british sci-fi
The master  along with her cybermen pose kills a lot of military people
The Dr. and Claire figure out the solution they must sacrifice good old Danny Pink who is now one of the  killing machine better known as a Cyberman
Keep in mind he was killed before the two-part finally (but, you don't know that if you watch the stand alone release)
Danny dies but, The Master (Michelle Gomez) is also killed off seriously!
A 5 star villain that clicked finally the right way without being to over the top and actually having the right amount of chemistry with the Hero
is killed of! After 50 years we finally get the proper version of The Master and they killer her off
Jesus....................
Then you get the grand finally The Dr. meeting bloody Santa Claus  (with a complete Back to the future rip-off ending)
Let me break the news to all the little boys and girls That last Dr Who X-mas Special was horrid beyond belief
the X-Mas special makes this look like Citizen Kane
but, that's another story....................
I in no way hate this season but, this two part finally was a massive let down when you compare all the  Big Over the top Season Finale  we have got since the re-boot
it's just very plain and lacking in many ways so many great ideas wasted and having someone  like Michelle Gomez get used and thrown out is just in poor taste

I can't help but, wonder if this is a cheap cash crab by slapping 3D on it people will double dip
I'll openly admit it I'm a little curious but, the price is a bit, high

I'd hope they at least edit this the proper way where all the plot holes are fixed and it's a straight 2hr. 3-D Film
I never heard this was shot in 3D so was the 3D in Post
The Epic Dr. Who The Day of The Doctor was a real 3D Film so that was legit this I'm not buying I think it's a marketing gimmick
If this at some point goes on sale for $14.99 I'll without a doubt snatch it up to check out the 3D effects",1440979200,,4820,4.2733260153677275
7373557,5,B013TYXUSM,"A fun story for Doctor Who fans to enjoy. I am shocked to see this story as a ""stand alone"" disc because the entire series 8 of this show sets up this finale better than just this story,I think. Unless, as a ""Whovian"", you don't care and you love it anyway. At least you'll get to the answer to the question,""Who's Missy?"" faster this way!",1440633600,3,339,4.230769230769231

7373566,3,B013TYXUSM,"Dr Who is Dr Who, so what can I say?  You are either a fan or not.  So as a Whovian, one might rate it as a 4, or 5 star.  Basically I purchased this Blu Ray for the 3D.  For the most part the 3D appears to be synthesized (as it is).  The 3D effects seem to be overdone in a number of scenes and caused some vision distress.  Native (camera) 3D would have been much better.  All I can say is to suggest to the producers: Next time turn down the 3D and place the reference plane better.",1460592000,2,485,3.79
7373567,4,B013TYXUSM,"Great story and the 3D is ok.  The Day of the Doctor has better 3D but they shot that for 3D.  This I think they just rendered the 3D to sell more Blu-rays.  But, it was still entertaining.",1454112000,2,189,3.9210526315789473
7373568,4,B013TYXUSM,"The 3D effects were remarkable consisering the budget. The release loses a star for me as the interview was a little like a typical Hollywood new release interview. The questions were hardly challenging and I think Wil Weaton's years of attending conventions have shaped hs technique which came across as a fan-boy who was a little too fawning and didn't have any searching questions. Certainly nothing to compare with the bonus content on the ""classic"" Dr. Who releases. Overall, worth a punt but why wasn't it included in the complete season box? Mind you, i should complain, at least it got released in the states, there's no sign of it coming out on this side of the water. BBC Video have dropped the ball (again).",1453680000,5,718,4.752
7373569,4,B013TYXUSM,"The real reason to buy this is the mini episode ""The Doctor's Meditation""!!!!
Also the special feature with Wil Wheaton interviewing Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman was pretty cool.

I was dissapointed that you could only buy it as a combo pack because I wanted the DVD.
When is the Industry going to figure out that there's still a huge percentage of the market that prefers DVD over Blu-Ray because DVDs can still play when they're scratched?",1453593600,,444,4.766233766233766

7373573,4,B013TYXUSM,"My wife and I saw this in the theater and thoroughly enjoyed it, and now I get the same experience at home.  This is one of the Doctor's most dramatic and touching stories, and it looks fantastic in big screen 3D (you have to see the opening titles in 3D to really appreciate them).  Underlying all the action and suspense (it is still a monster story) is a well-written exploration of love's deeper meanings.  Best line: ""Do you think that I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference?""

However, I must agree with Raymond Bradshaw's review, in that the bleak ending left us with a sense of crushing disappointment, and I felt sorry for those in the theater who didn't know the rest of the story.  I can't fathom why this edition doesn't include the end credits scene where Santa cuts in with ""You know it can't end like that!""  It's the following episode ""Last Christmas"" that really resolves the Clara & Danny story (while also introducing the creepiest monsters since the weeping angels).  Be sure to see at least this scene after watching Death in Heaven:

7373576,4,B013TYXUSM,I gave it 4 out of 5 because of it being  Dr Who and good story and in 3D which has not been released in the UK were Dr Who is made by BBC TV .  I took off one star as the story was not made in true 3D and this does mean that some scenes just don't work for 3D. Also we in the UK  don't have advertising on BBC videos / DVD / CD / Blue ray .  Back to the story and about two enmies of the Dr  1) Missey / Master  2) Cybermen. ......,1447286400,2,432,3.313131313131313

7373581,4,B013TYXUSM,Warning there is a 3d copy included but you have to have an all region 3d player in order to access it as it is a region 2 copy.  Other than that it is an entertaining Dr. Who adventure.  I'm not too crazy about the change in the cyberman.  Now all they have to do is touch you to turn you into a cyberman which doesn't make sense to me but other than that its fine.,1445990400,5,366,3.789473684210526

7373586,3,B013TYXUSM,"I give this only 3 ratings for the sad reverse-engineering the BBC did on this great season ending, 2-parter (of season 8).  I did not see it in theaters as I could not bring myself to pay for something I had already seen and was not shot in true 3D. I did get it for the extras, which include a behind the scenes with Capaldi, Coleman and Gomez.  Also included is the short prequel scene to the first episode of Season 9.  This doesn't mean these will not show up in the Season 9 box set, but for now, they are both on this disc.  It comes with the episodes in both 3D and non-3D.",1442966400,7,581,4.026086956521739
7373587,1,B013TYXUSM,"Doctor Who Dark Water Death in Heaven
 I Have a few words for Steven Moffat. Sir you have managed to alienate one Doctor Who's greatest supporters over these many years....My Wife, and I must say after viewing the fathom theaters event tonight. I am afraid I must agree with her feelings.

The stories have become far to dark, and violent. You have managed to suck ALL of the fun out of the series. Too the point she said ""After this I will NOT be watching"" I for one will view the new series, but I will NOT be buying the DVD / Blu-Ray's as I have in the past. Sir you and your staff have a lot to answer for.

I must give this episode only 1 star out 5. Owing to the crushing disappointment",1442448000,4,692,4.111111111111111
8728814,5,B013TYXUSM,I highly recommend buying this blu ray even if you don't have a 3D TV. I was not a fan of these two episodes in their broadcast for and felt the ending was made too light hearted taking away from the pain you see between the Doctor and Clara. This version combines the two episodes into a film/omnibus and complete gets rid of the christmas scene that interrupts the credits. Giving it the exact mood setting that it should've ended on.,1513123200,,436,4.395061728395062
