3687224,1,B001LMAKKG,"First off the series is amazing as the manga, the anime is to full of fillers that lend you nothing to the real experience. I started buying the box sets and had gotten all the way up to ""boxset"" 7 then i just stopped buying. They release each boxset with fewer and fewer dvds/episodes originally you got 5 dvds in the first few boxsets at around 20 episodes or so each. Now its 3 discs with last i looked 11 episodes FOR THE EXACT SAME PRICE. Yes boxset 1 was 39.99 day 1 this if you don't catch it during there random sales is 49.99!?! Really half the content but same money. I don't blame amazon or any individual seller its the VIZ media group who set the prices originally plus considering 11 episodes a boxset i give up on buying anymore this season and have started to sell mine so i don't get irritated about having an incomplete series.

No thanks just find it online to watch, if ya wanna be ripped off each season then buy it.",1323993600,4,937,4.23463687150838
3687225,5,B001LMAKKG,Bleach Uncut Box Set 10;  My son loves the series and it is something we can enjoy together.  As with the rest of the series well worth the purchase even if it is getting a bit pricey.,1323820800,3,184,3.945945945945946
3687226,5,B001LMAKKG,First I'm amazed that the other two reviews are crapy reviews that only tell you that this has Ichigo v Grimmjow. THIS BOX SET HAS 8 OTHER EPISODES THAN ICHIGO V GRIMMJOW. First it's the end of Uryu v arrarcar 106 then Chad v arrarcar 107. These fights are a nice look at non-espada (or former) arrarcars and seeing deeper how Azien set up his arrarcar army almost to insult the demoted espadas. Then after that Renji and later Uryu v Szayelaporro. After Uryu and Renji defeat Szayel The main show of Ichigo v Grimmjow begins. Out of all the fights in Bleach this is one of my faveroites. Compared to Ichigo v Ulquiorra which is too long or Ichigo v Azein which is too short. This fight is a nice length 3 episodes and I also belive this: If Ichigo and Grimmjow were both human in the world of the living they might be good friends. That is way off topic and I know that. For those who didn't know what episode were in this box set(because the other review were sooooo helpful) I hoped this let you know more than Ichigo v Grimjow and I highly recomend this.,1320969600,13,1058,4.295
3687227,5,B001LMAKKG,"Even if you have not been introduced to Bleach, this fight is worth watching.  Ichigo Kurosaki [Substitute Soul Reaper] vs. Grimmjow Jaegerjaques [Arrancar Number 6] - 'Nuff said.",1315872000,,179,5.392857142857143
3687228,5,B001LMAKKG,I can't wait to watch this next bleach DVD set I know It's going to be one of the greatest because Ichigo fight's Grimmjow one last time that's something I'm lokoking foward to watching.,1313971200,3,186,4.5

3687351,5,B001LMAKKG,Season 2 is among the best of Bleach and this set does it justice.  Now release Season 3 already!,1493078400,,97,4.105263157894737
3687352,5,B001LMAKKG,"I am a fan of this series and am excited to see it on Blu-ray because it is awesome. Streaming doesn't work so well in the country where I reside because the WiFi sucks, so I get the various series I like on disc just so I don't have to wait five hours to watch a thirty minute episode. Bleach is one of those mainstream anime series that I was told to avoid, but of course I decided to read it, and then watch it because I don't listen to anyone when it comes to anime. A person can like the mainstream and still like obscure. Bleach is one that I recommend for anyone who likes some action along with seeing fun characters fight fallen people in monster form.

I did notice that many people complained that this series didn't make the episodes fit the widescreen television sets. I am the opposite. I prefer it the way it was originally made. My biggest issue with One Piece is they did adjust it to make it fit the screen and it cuts off part of the original work, much like when a theatre movie was formatted to fit the screen. I say leave it alone. So I am happy with how Bleach was turned hi-def and preserved how it originally aired.

Any fan of Bleach, who hasn't already spent a year's pay on the regular DVDs should get the discs! They are awesome!",1492905600,2,1258,4.194214876033058
3687353,5,B001LMAKKG,"It contains 27 episodes coming up to about $1.77 CAD an episode. The quality of the subtitles is not great, but having the option to watch it in the intended, original audio is nice. Though this set ends in the middle of a season it has a lot of thrilling episodes and the story begins to pick up. If you don't have this series in another format already I highly recommend this version.",1492214400,,386,4.301369863013699
3687354,4,B001LMAKKG,"I would of gave this a 5 out of 5, but it deserve a 4 out of 5 because the price just keeping it from being a 5 out of 5. It's in HD alright, however all the episodes that comes in this Boxset is not worth $39.99. Only if this Boxset had the full Soul Society and all in HD than it's worth this price. All I'm saying is wait for a price drop for this or wait for it to go on sell. It stops where Ichigo & Rukia Big Brother about to fight. Which is really disappointing, but whatever. That's all I have to say for this. I already have this Boxset to.",1491609600,3,549,3.7413793103448274

3687607,4,B001LMAKKG,"This series is enjoyable but I think the writer or writers or being idiots.  They are prolonging the story.  Which after a while becomes boring.  So far it hasn't lost my attention yet.  Narotu Shippuden is probably a great story for manga, but as far as morons writing the show prolonging the story.  Been watching that a while.  After finally getting close to the conclusion of that story it just boring.  They kept building up to the story til just became not a surprise infact it took effort just to watch the show cause it lost its enjoyment.  They want more money so they put useless fillers destroying the story.  Anyway I got off subject.  This series so far is good but is starting to drag.",1389830400,,699,4.476190476190476

3687611,4,B001LMAKKG,In this box set the famous battle between Grimmjow and Ichigo both begins and concludes. It is an epic fast passed battle that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The only reason why this is only 4 stars is that I still wish the box sets would go back to the original set of at least 8 disks. Other than that great edition to anyone's Bleach collection.,1376352000,,357,4.114285714285714

3687613,1,B001LMAKKG,"I gave this box set one star because, I hate this anime now. When it first arrived, I loved watching it. One thing I liked are some of the characters. A second thing I liked are some of the openings and endings. A third thing I liked are some of the Arrancar Encyclopedia. One thing I disliked is how there's supposed to be a battle, but the characters talk too much. Another thing I disliked is the battles are so boring. A third thing I disliked is Grimmjow's final move during his third fight with Ichigo. I feel like it could have been better (if the anime was better.)

3687637,5,B001LMAKKG,"Well there is not much I can say about this anime that u can't just go read about on ur own but I'll do my beast. ^_^'
Ok boy can see ghosts, some ghosts eat other ghosts so there r other ghosts that stop the bad ghosts from eating the good ones, boy meets girl good ghost that gives him the power to become like her so that he can fight the bad ghosts.
I know that the bad ghosts r call something and r a little different than just ghosts and that the ones I'm calling good ghosts r called something else also.
I'm just trying to make it simple here ok. ^_^
I really do love this anime just don't want to go into great detail on what is what when someone just wants to know the basics of what they maybe buying even though if ur looking for a anime u most likely already know what ur looking for or buying if ur here.
