8301699,4,B001FB4YZ0,"I believe this is the same documentary known as The JFK Conspiracy (1978) and The Killing of President Kennedy, New Revelations 20 Years Later (1983). Produced by Anthony Summers. Executive producers: M.G. Hollo, David Osterlund for Syndicast Services.

It's very valuable for many rare interviews.

Malcolm Thompson examines the backyard photos of Oswald and explains that they are composites. John Sherman Cooper reveals doubts about the single bullet theory. Jesse Curry expresses the opinion that the head shot may have come from the front. Assistant D.A. William Alexander says that Oswald under interrogation seemed to have been prepared and rehearsed for questioning.

Gerry Patrick Hemming says he suspected Oswald was working for Naval Intelligence. Richard Sprague of the HSCA raises suspicions about how easily Oswald returned from the USSR. Senator Richard Schweiker wonders how Oswald got his Russian wife out of the USSR so easily. Carlos Bringuier remains convinced that Castro was behind the assassination. Ted Sorensen says that to his knowledge, the Kennedy brothers did not know about the plots to kill Castro. Burt Griffin blames the CIA for not telling the Warren Commission about the plots to kill Castro. William Gaudet talks about his receiving a visa at the same time as Oswald. Antonio Veciana talks about efforts to link Oswald with Castro agents, and the Maurice Bishop-Oswald link. Fidel Castro is interviewed. Sylvia Odio is interviewed on camera with only her shadow visible. Robert McKeown talks about his relations with Ruby.",1424563200,,1558,5.377049180327869
8301700,5,B001FB4YZ0,A classic 1979 BBC Documentary about the JFK murder.  The producers slant is towards the Cubans did it.  Valuable program for researchers to own because of the rare interviews done with Anti Castro Cubans.,1419033600,,205,5.0
8301701,3,B001FB4YZ0,"Compared to other documentaries that I have seen on the Kennedy assassination, I would rate this one as mediocre. It doesn't cover the information as thoroughly nor as in-depth as others that I have seen. If you are only going to have one documentary on this topic, this is not the one to own.
You would be better of with ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"". Even with it's banned last three chapters, it is still the best JFK documentary ever made.",1354752000,,442,4.469135802469136
