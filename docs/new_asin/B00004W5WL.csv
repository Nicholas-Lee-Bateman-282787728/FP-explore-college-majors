1362276,5,B00004W5WL,"This DVD has completed my conversion. All my life I have been used to Berlioz's Damnation of Faust as a concert work, and I have had no particular view as to whether it would be suitable for staging. The stage-production here is controversial and even provocative, but it has left me in no doubt at all that the work does not reveal its full stature and significance unless it is enacted. That Berlioz was a maverick I take to be a truism. Here is one of the deepest and most searching parables surely in all literature. Goethe's Faust is not a tragic hero in the Shakespearian sense, with a tragic failing leading to his downfall and death. He is a type of all mankind, embodying the maxim that Stapledon enunciated as Find your calling...or be damned. He is full of ennui, Weltschmerz and general alienation and dissatisfaction. He is not evil or corrupt, but he has hidden the talent that is death to hide, and he is largely a lost soul before Mephistopheles sees an easy prey and unerringly completes the process until all that is needed is his final signature, quickly and casually provided.
Heard and not seen, Berlioz's Faust is largely a lyrical work. There are intermittent `effects' indeed, and the final ride to the abyss seems to me one of the most thrilling in all music, understated as only a master of hyperbole and overstatement would know how to do; but an astonishing amount of the score is `absolute' music more notable for melody than for overt drama and consisting in large part of instrumental interludes and songs. Now stage the work and see what happens. The music is transformed into a sublime commentary and magnification as the tragedy unfolds with neither haste nor delay. I took in the staging in an impressionistic way, not an analytical one. Were the strange milk-churns that Faust and the others carried on their backs their souls, their selves, or what were they? They were a burden and load of some kind. Faust starts dressed in pure white and progressively dons black clothing like Mephistopheles. I felt no need to `understand' it in any detail, as I had my work cut out to get some better understanding of whole overall theme.
The musical direction impressed me favourably. I suspect that in a concert performance I might have found the tempi erring on the slow side, but even there that would be a good fault, and of course a concert performance is precisely what this is not. Paul Groves has a very innocent face, not my usual idea of Faust but not an ineffective or inappropriate one either. My first impression, with ears accustomed to Gedda in the part, was that his vocal timbre was on the light side, but it is a very attractive voice purely as a voice, he certainly does not lack power or show any sense of strain, and apart from one grisly undershoot in his duet with Marguerite he convinced me. Marguerite herself is the formidable Vesselina Kasarova and as you would expect hers is an intense rather than a tranquil reading of the part. Again not my usual idea of how to do it, but that is a matter of my temperament and habituation, not any attempt at objective assessment. Mephistopheles is the no less formidable Willard White, and to my eyes and ears he IS the part, very effectively lit at his first appearance and dominating the light-toned Groves in a way that I found just right.
This is far more of a work for grown-ups than I had ever suspected. The quirkiness that I have always tended to associate with Berlioz simply vanishes in this production. It is quite clear that not everyone will react favourably to the sets or to the production generally. I can only say that I would not have expected myself to either, but I did.",1069200000,18,3683,4.615853658536586
1362277,4,B00004W5WL,"The Faust Legend is heady stuff, arising from the heart of medieval Gothic culture.  No wonder it exercised such a strong effect on Goethe and on the opera composers (such as Gounod) who made settings of his dramatic poem.  Among these, Berlioz comes closest to Goethe in his understanding of the tale - not a maudlin love-story as in Gounod's setting but a depiction of demonism, intoxication, and shameless seduction as responses to boredom and mortality.  ""La Damnation de Faust"" (1846) elaborates Berlioz's earlier ""Huit Scenes de Faust"" (1828); the composer described it not as an opera but as a ""Lgende dramatique.""  For more than a century producers considered it unstageable; but in recent decades advances in stagecraft have solved most of the problems.  The performance preserved on the Arthaus DVD comes from the 1999 Salzburg Festival.  The company is a Spanish one, La Fura dels Baus.  The cast is vocally unexceptionable, with a fine Mephistopheles in Willard White, a decent Faust in Paul Groves, and a slightly overwrought but still plausible ingnue (Margarethe) in Vesselina Kasarova.  It's stage-director Alex Olle's visual conception that raises questions.  Maybe I'm reactionary, but I see ""La Damnation de Faust"" in Gothic terms; not necessarily as Gustave Dor saw it in his famous illustrations for Goethe's Part I (although that would be fine with me), but as close and stony in its setting, with architecture in the ogival style.  An expressionist mise-en-scene in the style of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" would be appropriate, too.  What La Fura dels Baus gives us, however, is a highly abstract, skeletal-industrial realization full of incomprehensible and seemingly arbitrary touches.  Faust, for example, wears what looks like a patient's uniform from a mental asylum; so does everyone else, except Mephistopheles, who appears to shop at Wilson's House of Leather and Suede.  Why is Faust (along with the chorus) lugging a milk-can on his back?  Why does Mephisto hand Faust a black leather loafer just before he takes him to see Margarethe for the first time?  What are the bizarre objects that look like rejected props from a sci-fi flick that the chorus shuffles around the stage?  The large tower just right of center-scene is supposed to represent an alchemist's oven, or alembic.  The action is supposed to be taking place ""inside Faust's mind.""  Yeah, but Faust had a Gothic mind, not a hackneyed post-modern one.  I felt the same moderate indignation that Peter Konwitschny's ""Tristan und Isolde"" inspired in me when it turned the ship in Wagner's Act I into a cruise-liner, and tarted up the scene in cream-whites with splashes of primary blue and red totally inappropriate to the darkness of the tale.  The eccentricity of the staging in this ""Damnation"" is a pity, since DVD is obviously THE medium for recorded opera; and because the performance is musically meritorious.  (It's not on the level of the criterion-setting Colin Davis readings, old or new, but it's good.)  Opera is as much stagecraft as it is music; so SEEING it is half the experience.  Even a materially limited staging, like those preserved on the videotapes of the Glyndebourne opera, can be fascinating to watch.  Bergman's ""Magic Flute"" and Syberberg's ""Parsifal"" are exemplary.  I'd like to see a less avant-garde mounting of Berlioz's compelling ""Legend.""  (There must be one, in some television archive somewhere.)  Even so, the added visual dimension makes the Arthaus DVD worth acquiring, especially if one were curious about Berlioz and did not already own a recording of ""La Damnation.""  The documentation is good, but buyers will have to content themselves with synopses of the plot rather than with a libretto.  This is not so much a problem, however, as viewers can select subtitles in a variety of languages, including the original French.  Recommended with the various qualms and qualifications stipulated above.",1040601600,24,3938,5.14622641509434
1362278,5,B00004W5WL,"Between the trinatron cylinder occupying the center of the stage to the faux rubber/leather costumes of the performers one can deduce that this is indeed a Euro-kink production of Berlioz' most melodic and underrated Symphony/Opera.
But despite the bizzare treatment, it works. In fact it works very well.
In fact the only complaint I have is the conductors insistance on playing certain pieces particularly slow....a bit of a nusance. But all in all a disc well worth the price.
Best of all is to see the interpretation of Berlioz' incredible music visually. While it dispenses with the stereotypical romantic visuals of flowers, forests, stone clad homes, wide reaching vistas. The music supplies these elements in the sublimely minimalist production. The music afterall is meant to suggest the emotional romantic canvas that our hero Faust exhists in. The minimalist production supports Fausts individual crisis. Creating a somewhat Terry Gilliam ""Brazil"" like approach to his struggle and eventual demise.
Watch and enjoy. You may need to view it a couple of times. But it is worth it.",1018396800,10,1089,5.228571428571429
1362279,5,B00004W5WL,"I have known this work most of my (long) life and often speculated with friends about how best to stage it; back in the day there were almost no stagings to see.  We pretty much concluded that only a special effects film could do it justice!  However, in this DVD my wife and I found thrills aplenty and must take issue with most of the negative criticism here and elsewhere; the shift is apparently to some kind of post-industrial hell, fair enough.  But the problem always has been to provide stage action during long stretches of music since there are no original stage directions and much space to fill.  I found this phantasmagoric blend of monumental sets and video projections to be absorbing, thought-provoking, and ultimately thrilling.  I feel that the usual Berliozian drug-induced fantasies with universal themes leave the field open to a broad range of interpretations, this as valid as any.  I do agree that I have heard better musical interpretations (get the original Munch/BSO recording) but that did not seriously spoil the overall pleasureable experience.  I was looking for a stunner of a visual experience in this and was not disappointed.",1013817600,10,1160,4.948453608247423
1362280,4,B00004W5WL,"I agree largely with other reviewers regarding the stage sets which can be bizarre. But I personally find the choreography  intriging, powerfully symbolic. One reviewer pointed out the various symbolic subjects used such as using milk bottles carrying Faust's psychic , his clothes changing to dark jacket that matches Mephisto's, meaning that he is gradually being drawn to hell. If I have not known that the music was not originally for staging I would have thought the Damnation of Faust was an opera because it  works so well as a stage performance.
True, there are silly moments when the dancers  never appear during the ballet music. They never ride on horses and scenary described in the lyrics does not match the stage. But the visual effects on the cylinder furnace,especially when Faust  fell to Hell and the scene where some ugly devils were shown doing some rock climbing  (yes I think stunt men were used, including one for Faust as he fell into Hell). The use of a gigantic cylinder as a furnace to make/ or recycle souls is relly interesting, though I wonder how much it costs to stage it together with the special effects, and I wonder how much the audience can see because singers are often hidden somewhere in the cylinder. Indeed I wonder how the sound projects out of the cylinder when the singers sing from inside, especially when there is a scene in which Faust is trapped inside a narrow transparent tube as he continues to sing. No problems when seeing this DVD, as the vocals are well projected and recorded, though they are too forwardly balanced (the orchestra seems to have been at the backgraound, and if I adjust the volume so the orhcestra is loud enough, vocal seems too loud).  Orchestra playing is fine though the Hungarian March is strangely quiet and tame (not wild at all) Perhaps the orchestra was not warm up and it seems true that as the performance moves on, the orchestra sounds better and louder.  Singers are all great, and how can one not admire the solo sung by a boy in the choir during the Epilogue. Everone look appropriate for their age. Some may prefer a more delicate, more FRENCH Marguerite than Kasarova, who though looks attractive and sings with great expression sounds at times too powerful, like a Wagnerian Heroine. All in all, a great achievement in bringing this Legende Dramatique vividly on stage. A must for those fascinated with modern/symbolic staging rather some boring traditional mountains, grassland and ancient costumes etc.  Woudl be a five star if they can fix the balance with the orchestra",997488000,4,2564,4.8113636363636365
1362281,1,B00004W5WL,"The German orchestra play this rhythmically vibrant, linear, melodically sprung score as if it was Beethoven or Brahms.  It plods, four square, without the fire and thrust of Berlioz' most transcendent score. (Yes, arguable I know.)  Avoid this performance; the visuals add nothing, but the good news is neither do they detract from a yawning orchestral ""missing of the point"" and almost total failure to communicate the unique Berlioz profundity and panache.  If I seem overly harsh, it is only because I wanted to embrace it so enthusiastically.  Stick to the Colin Davis Phillips CD recording.  Even the Kent Nagano is well done for the most part, although his singers are inferior to Davis's.",996105600,16,696,5.0701754385964914
1362282,4,B00004W5WL,"I was eagerly looking forward to La Damnation de Faust recorded at the 1999 Salzberg Festival.  All indications pointed to a rousing Berlioz event, and musically it was not disappointing at all.  Regretably in this case the symbolism overrides the plot, and there is nothing left to appreciate but the music.  People in white costumes, playing soccer?  The same people moving some indiscript machine around the stage to represent the war machine in the ""Hungarian March""? A bald red-headed Mephisto?  No dancing in the ballets?  In places I closed my eyes and just listened.  A decade ago I saw a similar ""Damnation of Faust"" presented by a Philadelphia opera company, and it was just as mind numbing and illogical as this production.  When the Faust story cannot stand on its own, without this constant re-interpretation it will cease to be a classic, and that will never happen. There's nothing wrong with symbolism, unless it gets in the way of the story.  Why can't the story be ""symbolic friendly"" without jerking Faust out of the middle ages into some nebulous environment where it is impossible for the tale to unfolded as it was written?  Berlioz never intended this version of Faust to be presented as a staged opera.  On his first trip to London the empressario Julien, made an offer for him to convert it into an opera, but that fell through. He would have obviously changed some things had he done so.  The technical problems presented by ""La Damnation de Faust"", especially the Ride to the Abyss make it very difficult to stage effectively, although the Salzberg production did a fair job technically, utilizing a large cylinder where some of the action took place.  However, my suggestion is that until someone can do it right, leave the piece alone.  The human mind is still the best stage for this remarkable work.  The singing was very good, the orchestra played the piece the way Berlioz should be played, and the sound was excellent.  And a big plus is the 5.1 Dolby Digital  - that alone is worth the price of the DVD. My only quibble with the sound was in the Hungarian March where the bass drum representing distant cannon fire was barely audible.  I rate this version 4 stars for the music and the sound. You might find the staging amusing; just don't let it distract you from the music.",970790400,34,2310,4.7325
1362283,4,B00004W5WL,"There is a word currently used in the world of opera, Eurotrash, which  means an absurd ""concept"" staging of an opera in which symbolism  runs riot, all too often at the expense of the drama and of the acting, let  alone the singing. At first, I said Here We Go Again when I began to view  the Arthaus Musik DVD edition of Berlioz' <La Damnation de Faust>  (10011 018), giving us the 1999 Saltzburger Festspiele production.
  First all the negative elements.
  The stage contains a gigantic  transparent cylinder in and around which most of the action takes place.  The backdrop consists of three tiers of arches. The chorus is dressed  throughout in loose fitting white outfits that make them look like bakers  and they are forever carrying on their backs what looks like the old  fashioned milk containers used on dairy farms. (They are supposed to be the  holders of man's psyches, you learn if you read the notes.)
  Faust is  similarly dressed but little by little, he keeps replacing his garments  with black pieces identical to Mephisto's. (The two sides of man's  personality, you see.) Marguerite has to settle for the same black evening  gown throughout. (She has always been devilish? With such symbolism, who  can tell?)
  The peasants who should be dancing on the green, according  to what they themselves are singing, are wearing smoked glasses to see an  eclipse of the sun, while later a small group is kicking around a soccer  ball to show jollity. During the Hungarian March, we have the same  whiteclad chorus forming a procession with those milk jugs, during the  Ballet of the Sylphs, we have Mephisto slowly crossing the stage and not a  dancer in sight, and during the Ballet of the Will-o'-the-Wisps we have  those same jugs acting as flashlights but again no dancing.
  The result  of all this is that we lose any feeling that these are real people (even  the Devil should come over as a personality and not a symbol), much to the  detriment of the drama.
  The subtitles often play free and loose with  the French text, usually elaborating a simple French phrase into something  more poetical, now and then introducing a slang word like ""savvy""  (for ""style de savant""). And one has to wince when the gray  haired Mephisto (Willard White, a black singer) iss described by the chorus  as pale and red haired.
  The opening and closing titles indicate that  this video should be shown with letterbox formatting. Also, the booklet's  numbering of the tracks is one less than your player will show on the  readout.
  Now for the good aspects.
  Computer-generated images  are often projected onto the cylinder to stunning visual effect. We  actually see horses during the Ride to Hell sequence (although Faust and  Mephisto remain stationary.  Faust's fall into the abyss looks quite real,  although I wonder what the audience saw from their seats. Marguerite's song  about the King of Thule and his goblet seems to take place inside an  immense goblet that dissolves at the end of the song, again to great  effect.
  The singing was first rate, if the acting was not. Paul  Groves' voice was just right for both Faust's lyrical moments and his  dramatic ones. Willard White was a very imposing looking Mephisto and  managed to be appropriately mocking in his serenade. His voice was almost  drowned out only in the Hell sequence in which the orchestra was too loud  for a good balance. Vesselina Kasarova sang a sympathetic Marguerite and  really tried acting during her two great solos, only to be defeated by  having to sing from the cylinder. The close-ups unkindly accentuated the  perspiration in which all three were bathed.
  The singing of the chorus  was mostly very good, considering they were not allowed to move while  vocalizing, and only during the first part of the Easter Hymn were they  almost inaudible. Sylvian Cambreling lead his Staatskapelle Berlin with  energy and now and then with the delicate nuance that this score  demands.
  It is, after all, the only ""Damnation"" on video;  but I hope some day for a more traditional treatment.",966297600,70,4080,4.832361516034985
1362312,5,B00004W5WL,"I have nothing but praise for everyone connected with this production.  The Chicago Symphony and Chorus, and Sir George are all at the top of their games, and the soloists are superb.  I also thought the video production quality was first-rate, although I can sympathize with the reviewer who would have liked to see more emphasis on the brass section.

I love Berlioz, who is in my opinion often under-rated by both critics and music lovers.  I should think that performances like this one would help create a lot more Berlioz lovers.

By the way, my thanks to the authors of the excellent reviews that came before mine, and convinced me to buy this DVD.  It will bring me countless hours of pleasure.",1253750400,10,702,4.666666666666667
1362313,5,B00004W5WL,"Berlioz's Masterpiece is -unfortunately- neglected by the big opera houses world wide. That is too bad. In my opinion its musical and dramatic content is on par with any of the composer's -more popular- contemporaries. I found this production absolutely fascinating and enjoyable. Great voices, acting and what an artful staging!! I recommend this DVD to every opera lover.

1362314,1,B00004W5WL,"UGH! Another terrible purchase. WHY oh WHY do these modern staging fanatics get their way with period operas? Just as Boris Godunov was ruined by grotesque modern costumes and staging, Berlioz' ""La Damnation de Faust"" is virtually unrecognizable due to hideous staging and costumes from a mental institution.

When will the producers of DVD's learn this sort of trash has no appeal for many classical music / opera lovers?

The storyline of this opera in particular is almost impossible to follow due to the wretched distractions in bizarre stage design, costumes, and stage direction. Without the sound one would never guess what was going on.

Speaking of the sound, I find the performance itself quite lacking. It's dull at best and in competition with the horrible images on screen the music loses the battle.

BOYCOTT ALL SUCH MODERN STAGE PRODUCTIONS OF OPERA!",1250380800,9,866,5.077464788732394
1362315,2,B00004W5WL,I recently saw a staged version of the damnation en direct from the Met in HD at a local cinema. No comparaison possible! I had to force myself to stay awake listening to the concert version on that cd; I had to hold my breath during the staged version!,1228176000,5,253,4.183673469387755
1362316,5,B00004W5WL,"This production, apart from being a quite satisfying performance of the musical piece, has excellent dramatic presentation.  The soloists perform as they sing, with facial expression, emotional intensity and interaction that almost transports them to an imaginary theatrical set provided by the musical imagery. Kind of like radio dramas, but with some visual support.  This facet of the presentation is showcased by a well crafted videography that is relentlessly capturing the strongest musical and dramatic moments with well timed shot sequences.  A real tribute to the true intent of the composer.

Kudos to the excellent camera crew for this live production.",1210636800,15,663,5.534653465346534
1362317,3,B00004W5WL,"I gave this DVD a positive review because it is beautiful music, it's great to see Sir Georg & Co. go at it, and it is certainly interesting to know what happens in this work outside of the ""Hungarinan March"". However, as a Tuba Player, I have to warn others, who, like me, may be wishing to observe our forefather Arnold Jacobs in action. All who fall into this category will surely be disappointed as not only does the camera seem to deliberately avoid the low brass, and specifically the chair with whoever is playing tuba in it (for the record, all photography directors hired for these gigs need to be taken aside at some point and shown the basics of score reading), but there is no audible presence from the Tuba at all (whomever it might actually be ;-).

1362318,2,B00004W5WL,"I'm going to be brief, and not say what I really feel about the staging of this production.  After reading several reviews, it's quite obvious that many people have a great appreciation for this modern, minimalist style of production.  In the end, that depends entirely on the viewer's tastes.  I will say that I can not see it as an appropriate aesthetic match to the style and beauty of Berlioz' music.  There are certain genres of music that work very well with bizarre, stark, cumbersome staging.  Most of them date from or after the late romantic period (i.e. late 1800s), when extreme freedom of musical form was able to complement similar freedom in visual form.  Wagner's Ring Cycle, Berg's and Janacek's operas, Puccini's Turandot are a few examples that come to mind.

Take most baroque, classical, or not-late-romantic [in this case, 1846] works and try to thrust that kind of avant-garde design upon them and you end up with a ludicrous clash between the music/characters/drama and sets/costumes/staging.  This Salzburg production of ""Damnation"" wasn't trashy or unduly ugly -- but it just doesn't fit.  Enough said about that.

Musically, the majority of the performance was beautiful.  Paul Groves and Willard White, as Faust and Mephistopheles, sang -- and acted -- with distinction; dedicated performances by talented young singers.  However, I was terribly disappointed with mezzo-soprano Vasselina Kasarova, especially after reading so many positive reviews of her recordings.  No major complaints about the voice itself, but what she does with it -- awkward, unmusical phrasing and some of the most eccentric acting I've ever seen.  Her Marguerite comes off as an affected society heiress, full of big-toothed smiles, instead of a sincere, love-struck maiden.  Her big aria, ""D'amour, l'ardente flamme"" which is sung after she is abandoned by Faust, almost always moves me to tears, but this version was a let-down.  Then again, her skin-tight black latex costume (!) and the staging itself may very well have contributed to this kind of portrayal.

Orchestra and chorus very fine, conducting of a high caliber.  But when I think of how profoundly moving a really good performance of this work can be, I am indeed moved -- to give this video only 2 stars.",1189641600,5,2274,5.1
1362319,5,B00004W5WL,"My husband and I have watched this DVD several times, with each viewing increasing our understanding of Berlioz' moving and powerful work. We were preparing ourselves to see ""The Damnation of Faust"" presented by the San Francisco Symphony, which also featured the wonderful baritone Willard White as Mephistopheles. The set was outstanding, spare yet beautiful; the gleaming tower and stark wall form the perfect backdrop for the chorus and soloists.  I am so glad to find this for sale, as we borrowed it from the library. Now it will be part of our own collection. I recommend it wholeheartedly!",1178496000,3,597,5.03030303030303
1362320,5,B00004W5WL,"Hector Berlioz (1803-1869) was a revolutionary composer but the nature of his musical upheaval isn't clear until one takes a few facts into consideration. Between 1789 and 1820 France was in a state of perpetual tumult that left her literature and arts in stasis; while from across the channel, young English poets contemplated the French Revolution and new poetic impulses were born. Wordsworth's Preface to his Lyrical Ballads in 1801 is the epochal statement of 19th Century English Romanticism. France still stagnated. The following two facts are stunning: not a single play by Shakespeare was successfully presented in France for the two centuries from his death in 1616 until Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet played at the Odeon theatre in Paris in 1827. Included in the audience of jubilant young Romantics was an enthralled Hector Berlioz. And the music of Beethoven was scarcely known in France until Francois Antoine Habeneck was placed in charge of reorganizing the Conservatory Concerts and presented the first performance of the Eroica Symphony in 1828. Attending that concert was the same soon-to-be ex-medical student, Hector Berlioz. That same year, Berlioz created his arch-Romantic Symphonie fantastique, revolutionizing musical syntax. That he created it ex nihilo in a relatively barren French cultural landscape makes his achievement all the more stupendous. Yet it also contained the seeds for the attendant difficulties and failures of his subsequent work, including La Damnation de Faust. The ground simply had not been properly sown to bear the fruit of Berlioz's genius!

Berlioz had cast Goethe's Faust, in its Gerard de Nerval translation, into 8 dramatic scenes as a youthful enterprise in 1828 which he then sent to Goethe upon its completion. When Goethe failed to respond, not even acknowledging receipt of the manuscript, Berlioz withdrew the work and destroyed it. Thus the matter lay until the winter of 1845/46. Berlioz, while on a tour of Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Silesia, was inspired by Hungarian music to throw himself into a new composition: La Damnation de Faust. He wrote the piece on-the-fly as he traveled. It had its premiere in November 1846 at the Comic Opera in Paris. Conceived not as an opera but, as he described it, a ""Legende dramatique en quatre parties"". Parisians did not know what to make of it and stayed away in droves. The second performance was similarly sparsely attended. Berlioz was so disappointed that he wrote no large scale secular works for the rest of his life. Faust was particularly manhandled in Germany by Goethe's self-appointed protectors. It did not matter that this Faust was freely adapted from Goethe's text. Berlioz's temerity in appropriating the great man's ideas was an egregious sin, sufficient grounds for condemnation, leaving the work unplayed in Germany for years despite admirers such as Liszt. Thus was Berlioz's masterpiece thrust upon a venomous world.

This DVD is a live recording of a performance during the 1989 Promenade Concert season at the Royal Albert Hall marking the start of Sir Georg Solti's farewell tour as conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. As such, a valedictory atmosphere prevails amongst performers and audience, heightening the already emotionally charged expectations surrounding this comparatively infrequent staging of the Faust. Even were this not being recorded, I suspect the performers would have been keen to deliver a taut, dramatic, technically flawless reading of Berlioz's ""dramatic legend"". That is precisely what they do deliver. The Chicago Symphony players profess their admiration and respect for Sir Georg by filling the hallowed Albert Hall with a nearly perfect performance. The Orchestra has never sounded more energetic, yet plays the more sedate passages with delicacy and taste. The horns and winds are particularly fine, playing with power and precision. The strings have a silky sheen reminiscent of the Philadelphia Orchestra under Ormandy, yet play Berlioz's more sardonic pages with bite and grit. Solti molded this Orchestra into a world class organization over the years and they prove it here. The Chicago Symphony Chorus under Chorus Master Margaret Hillis is superb. The Chorus of the Westminster Cathedral under James O'Donnell is similarly brilliant, lending a lovely melting sweetness to the slightly more brazen Chicago voices. Together, their sound is stupendous during Choral outbursts that must be heard to be believed. These massed voices are worth the price of admission!

The four soloists are all at their peak on this recording. Marguerite is sung by mezzo-soprano Anne-Sofie von Otter who is wonderful in the role. Her voice is pliant yet dark, hinting at evil's seduction of a pure soul. Perfect casting. Faust is New Zealand tenor Keith Lewis, who lends the role dignity amidst demonic turmoil. His singing is excellent, acting convincingly with his voice, showing terror or defiance with equal expertise. Mephistopheles is sung by Jose van Dam. Bravado, cunning and guile are all portrayed by his singing. English singer Peter Rose is Brander with a sonorous bass. Solti conducts brilliantly. I have only a minor quibble, preferring even greater ferocity in some of the climactic moments. As I say, it is a minor point. The performance is superb overall. I enjoyed it immensely and was often quite moved by both the work and the atmosphere surrounding this performance. The extensive applause at the end had many in the audience in tears.

This DVD is recorded in color with a full screen image and a 4:3 aspect ratio. The Region Code is NTSC 0 Worldwide. The menu languages are German, French, English and Spanish. Subtitles are in the same 4 languages. The sound format is PCM stereo which is clear and vivid, lending nice presence to the live recording. The running time of this disc is 134 minutes. There are no extras other than an excellent 32 page booklet in English, French and German.

This is a superb DVD of a rarely performed work. I strongly recommend it to everyone but especially lovers of Choral singing and Romantic Orchestral music. This is the recording to help you acquire a taste for Berlioz if this composer has eluded you until now.

1362321,1,B00004W5WL,"I recently bought this DVD and it is very disappointing in just about any way I can think of.  Before I would have thought it impossible to make a boring DVD of Damnation but they did it.  The singers are uninteresting and hammy, often looking into nothingness with vacant looks of ____ (insert shock, love, awe, horror, or embarassment).  Average pitch and diction.  The English subtitles are adequate.  The tempi are all slower than normal, managing to lose all excitement.  The opening scene through the march is leaden and the ride to hell ambles along at a walk.  The live recording has all the technical warmth of an amateur performace recorded in a barn.  The less said about the setting the better.  The graphics and images have little resemblance to the music.  Especially bad is the ride to hell.  (and to hell it should go!) Repeated clumsy CGI of a horse and a piston.  A horse and pistion when the Berlioz calls for bats, nightbirds, a hideous beast, skeletons, clouds, an army of demons and a rain of blood.  Heady stuff but you get a horse and piston with Faust and Mephistofeles standing above the fray pointing at nothing.
Goodwill, here it comes.
The rattling sound from Montemart is Berlioz rolling over in his grave.",1084838400,16,1236,4.693023255813953
7924870,5,B00004W5WL,"Berlioz' version of the centuries-old Faust drama covers much of the ground in the most famous of all accounts, that of Goethe, but the great German romantic poet, finishing his poetic play decades after he started it, has Faust saved in the next-to-last act, and devotes his final act to the translation of Faust heavenward, cheered on by choirs of angels, heavenly children, other saved souls, earth-bound holy men and New Testament women.  The immortal Faust moving swiftly up the spiritual layers of heaven is reunited with the now immortal Gretchen.  By far the best musical rendering of this is the long second movement of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 9 -- and it is always a concert piece.  Berlioz' Damnation of Faust
also works best as a concert piece rather than a staged opera, and that is what we have in this superb performance by Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony on tour in the capacious and splendid Royal Albert Hall, London.  The Chicago Symphony Choir tagged along with the
orchestra, and has excellent reinforcement from English choristers including some children.  Berlioz' brilliant scoring and Jose van Dam's superb singing drive home the fact that, in this version, the devil wins Faust's soul.  But not Gretchen's! The other soloists sustain the high standards of this glorious performance, and if one feels sorry for Faust, one can always take consolation by reverting to the Mahler 8th.",1473206400,,1416,5.004255319148936
7924871,4,B00004W5WL,"Hector Berlioz is a highly original and interesting composer and his music deserves being heard attentively and repeatedly. La damnation de Faust, subtitled ""Lgende dramatique en quatre parties"", is rather in the nature of an oratorio, and is often played in this format (cf. the brilliant 1989 performance conducted by Solti, starring Anne Sofie von Otter, Keith Lewis and Jos Van DamArtHaus 102 123). However, in the 1999 Salzburg festival, La Fura del Baus, justly celebrated for iits rich and resourceful scenic imagery, managed to stage it as an opera of sorts. The complex score is beaitifully played by the Staatskapelle Berlin conducted by Cambreling, and the singers White, Kasarova, and Groves do a wonderful job. The staging is quite arbitrary but I must admit that I liked it. I object though to the publisher's sordid omission of French subtitles, which non-French speakers like me need to follow the text being sung.",1389830400,,930,5.125

7924873,1,B00004W5WL,"I don't like La Damnation of Faust, a composition that glorifies one of the most corrupt institutions in the world, which relies on belief instead of science for its world view. The belief in angels and devils, heaven and hell, and an afterlife is pure fabrication. The Roman Catholic church is run by men and the nuns have little or no say about how the church is run. Many nuns are leaving the church as a result.
And finally, thousands of Catholic priests have molested young boys and  girls. Instead of protecting the children, the priests are moved to other parishes and protected and are not removed from the priesthood. Unlike many Protestant churches, most important decisions are made in Rome.
I have worked in a number of countries in Central America, where it is generally admitted that many priests share a household with a woman and their children.

7924875,5,B00004W5WL,"This was the second of two recorded versions of ""The Damnation of Faust"" by Hector Berlioz.  The first was a digial lp/cd recording from 1981.  This performance was a televised production at London's Royal Albert Hall.
It's almost a shame that he didn't stage it at his old stomping grounds, Covent Garden, as an operatic production--which it most certainly can be. The orchestral performance in the 1981 recording was crisper and more colorful--although the CSO plays brilliantly here as well.  Still, I prefer the the 1981 version of the famous Rakozy (Hungarian) march. Chicago's classical music station plays the 1981 CSO version of the Rakozy march when it's honoring Berlioz's birthday.  It has a little more color and bounce while this version sounds a tad flatter and slower.  While the sound is phenomenal, I did miss some of the spacious acoustical reverberation in the Royal Albert Hall that I have detected in taped radio broadcasts from the CSO in this venue. However, it was a wise idea to stage the Westminister Cathedral Chorus slightly off stage since their brief appearance at the end is meant for a heavenly, ethereal effect.  I attended the Chicago performance that preceded this European presentation and the off-stage singing was too distant.  I believe the soloists Solti selected were better suited for this taped televised production. Jose van Dam reprises his role as Mephistopheles.  The rest of the cast is superb.  I detect a strong European flavor to it in that everyone's French diction and accent are spot on.",1319155200,5,1541,5.035433070866142

7924878,5,B00004W5WL,"Make that ""singing French"", though tenor Paul Grove's pronunciation of franais is the weakest part of his excellent vocal technique. But there's something culturally implausible about a French Faust, as there would be about a German Cyrano or an Italian Peer Gynt. None of the several French and Italian operas based on Goethe's ""Faust"" make much effort to portray the title character as the Promethean hero pursuing transcendental knowledge; instead he's merely a narcissistic fool and seducer, doomed to perdition for his one moment of bad conscience, while Margarethe achieves salvation by the innocent fidelity of her love. That's the outcome of Berlioz's semi-opera 'La Damnation de Faust"". For a professed atheist, Berlioz celebrates Margarethe's redemption in solemn Marian Catholic fashion!

But coherence was not the forte of Hector Berlioz ( 1803-1869), either as a librettist or as a composer, nor was it his objective. Ecstasy was. Consuming passion was. The score of The damnation of Faust is an inchoate phantasmagoria, more an orchestral/choral poem than a drama for the stage, a melange of symphonic overtures, Goliardic drinking songs, marches, village dances, Latin prayers and satanic chants in an incomprehensible language. It's also very exciting music. The duet between Faust and Margarethe in the third scene is luscious, and Margarethe's lovelorn solo in the fourth scene is exquisite.  Paul Grove sings Faust as well, I think, as the role could possibly be sung, and Vessalina Kasarova soars musically in the role of Margarethe. Basso Willard White doesn't quite reach their level vocally, but his devilish demeanor and demonic stage presence carries the water emotionally for the whole production.

Berlioz reportedly shaped most of the libretto himself, drawing from the French translation of Goethe by Gerard de Nerval. It does the music little justice. I'd wager that if a listener didn't know the Goethean tale of Faust fairly well, he/she would have not the slightest idea what was happening on stage. Even for those who know the legend, or the poetic drama in German by Goethe, or the play in English by Kit Marlowe will find this libretto flimsy and reductionist. Of course, as in many great and famous operas, it's only the music that matters.

Coherence takes a serious hit, however, in the staging at the Salzburger Festspiele, recorded on this DVD. An almost fatal hit. I nearly shut the whole thing down in the first scene, I was so far from 'engaged' by the sets and dramaturgy. It seemed painfully clear that the 'narrative' being enacted had no connection whatever to the words being sung. In fact, I paused the DVD and read the synopsis in the notes ... and found myself utterly confounded! The 'plot' of the synopsis explicitly reconstructed the Faust legend as a kind of cocktail shaking of souls! And even so, I couldn't honestly find much congruence between the actions on stage and the symbolic excesses of the synopsis. The production, in short is truly wretched, a whole lot of pretentious 'son et lumiere' of the sort even American tourists would gag at. And yet....

...and yet, as one previous reviewer has already stated, ""it grew on me"". Or rather, I grew inured to its banality and let myself enjoy the superb singing and the eccentric brilliance of the music. Would a CD be just as good? Perhaps. It would depend on your attention span.",1275696000,,3392,5.05
7924879,5,B00004W5WL,"The opening scene didn't look promising, as Faust did not look like one expects Faust to appear.  But the performance improved all the way to the end.
