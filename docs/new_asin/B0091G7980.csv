5241681,5,B0091G7980,"this film sets an amazing dark mood, similar to TAXI DRIVER or DRIVE and never lets go.  one of the things that i see indies fail to do again and again is to get tone right... and this one excels at it.  from start to finish i was riveted by the world.  i have never seen boston like this in a movie before.

there are great performances, amazing photography.  this is better than most hollywood thriller/action/crime movies that i see, by a long shot.",1353196800,3,452,4.333333333333333
5241682,5,B0091G7980,"This movie was amazing, especially the performance of Nico Stone. It gave a very authentic representation of Boston. Highly recommended!",1353110400,3,136,5.85
5241683,2,B0091G7980,"Waste of my time. The trailer makes this seem almost like an action flick -- far from it. The ending was a total disappointment, as if the director couldn't make up his mind how to end it and leaves the viewer to their own ending. I never had any feeling for any of the characters in this movie; they deserved whatever their lot in life had become.",1353110400,2,348,4.208955223880597
5241684,5,B0091G7980,"Booster is a truly fantastic Indy suspense flick with a little something different!

Well directed,beautifully shot, with great performances from ""Non-Actors.""

Boston is of course a great city for this kind of movie, and one has to but point the camera at the city to increase production value, but the director here chose a few vantage points and establishing shots that painted a little different picture of our fair city.

Of course, the addition Seymour Cassel (a muse of Cassavettes)gives this flick plenty of ""Street Cred,"" but the most standout performance by far was the brother Sean, played by Brian Mcgrail. His character is the lynchpin of the whole thing, and although he didn't have much time on screen, he has the REAL brooding intensity that millions of actors have been trying to fake since Brando. I have the feeling the director and the cast are all going to do well, but I think McGrail is one to watch--",1352764800,2,924,4.79874213836478
5241705,5,B0091G7980,"I loved this movie. It was beautifully filmed with a unique and entertaining story line. Performances by Nico Stone and Adam DuPaul in particular were outstanding, it is hard to believe that neither are professional actors. Matt Ruskin did a great job on the script, the filming and the casting. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone considering watching it.",1354838400,,364,5.083333333333333
5241706,5,B0091G7980,"The cinematography in this movie floored me. It was so beautiful and well shot it almost needed no dialogue. The acting was incredible, especially since many actors did not have a lot of experience. The total standout was newcomer Adam DuPaul, who was tough and realistic and as always, utterly sexy. :)",1354838400,,303,4.846153846153846
5241707,5,B0091G7980,"""Booster"" represents the dilemma of many young people today: the conflicts between survival needs, family loyalties, and the ethical imperative of the individual. As the world around us degenerates, and the stresses in our society increase, this story will have an ever greater resonance.",1354406400,,288,5.568181818181818
5241708,5,B0091G7980,"most films lack the ability to depict the authenticity and gritty nature of life,
""booster"" glides closer to the truth of a people and a place, more than most,
a very engaging slice of life effort from mr ruskin",1354320000,2,211,4.435897435897436
5241709,5,B0091G7980,"Matt Ruskin is a director to look out for. Booster is a gritty, suspenseful movie with a lot of heart. Really well acted and just extremely enjoyable. A must watch.",1354147200,2,164,4.5
5241710,5,B0091G7980,"This film stands out from it peers in the emergent Boston crime drama genre. In fact to put it in the same category as The Town and The Departed is doing it a disservice. It is not violence that carries the narrative here, it is the realism and complexities of its characters, especially Nico Stone and Adam Dupual. Stone, the anti-hero-hero must negotiate his debt to his family and his own criminal identity, which is not a sexy dilemma, but I find it far more attractive than the muscle flexing that goes on in most crime movies. There is also a creeping rhythm to the whole thing, which some may find to be a flaw, but it really carries the suspense, and sense that as a viewer, you are witnessing, and at the same time feeling the brooding internal struggle of the main character",1353715200,,784,4.451388888888889
5241711,5,B0091G7980,"I was lucky enough to see this film at the Boston Film Festival. It is one of the best movies I have seen all year. Nico Stone's portrayal of Simon, a small-time shoplifter, caught in an impossible dilemma, is quietly intense. He uses body language and minimal means to convey a young man trapped by a conflict between his obligation to family and his essential morality. The director Matt Ruskin, uses a tight, yet almost documentary style, to build the claustrophobic world that Simon has to negotiate. Amazing that an essentially simple and quiet film with no flash-bangs got its hooks so deeply into me. I cared a great deal about what was going to happen to Simon.",1353628800,4,669,4.677966101694915
5241712,5,B0091G7980,"Being from Boston, I loved it. Especially the unexpected ending. For a low budget independent film made with mostly non-actors, this film more than holds it's own and should have had a wider release. Hopefully more people will be able to see it now that it's widely available online. I look forward to seeing what the cast and writers will come up with next.",1353369600,2,358,4.609375
5241713,5,B0091G7980,"I was lucky enough to catch this film @ SXSW this year.  A strong and powerful story about the extreme decisions some are forced to make between family and self.  Extremely well told and directed by Matt Ruskin and bravo to the cast especially Nico Stone.  I look forward to more films by the members of this group, for sure!!!!",1353196800,2,328,4.433333333333334
5241714,5,B0091G7980,"I thought the morals values that people discover in their own lives can be challenging.
It was enlightening to see a young man go through the sequences of deciding the best
route to take. Fabulous actors, direction and crew!",1353196800,4,224,4.769230769230769

8534104,5,B0091G7980,"I had the good fortune of seeing ""Booster"" at the Boston Film Festival. I was looking forward to seeing the movie for over a year and it did not disappoint me. It was a quiet, contemplative journey into the mind of a young man with a big dilemma. The actors were spot on with their portrayal of their characters. Nico Stone was intense as the main character ""Simon"". Adam DuPaul was dynamic and did an extremely convincing  portrayal of the small time criminal middle man ""Paul"". His gritty, no holds barred acting, brought the screen to life, a perfect balance to Nico's quiet, brooding demeanor. Bravo to these two first time actors Adam and Nico. Nice cast of supporting characters too. I'll definitely buy this movie, so I can watch it a few more times. Can't wait to see more from these actors. Two thumbs up to Boston boys Adam DuPaul and Nico Stone.",1370390400,,856,4.558441558441558
8534105,1,B0091G7980,"I got sucked into renting this, I was actually angry at the end for wasting my $ 4.00 on this garbage.  It was really poor.  Kept waiting for it to pick up all the way to the end.",1357171200,,179,3.6842105263157894
8534106,1,B0091G7980,"Sorry guys, but the most, not all, but the most of the reviews here are fake, template written posted every 2 days by accounts that never posted before. It's a shame, shame on the producer and shame on Amazon for letting this happen.

Giving it 1 start just for that fact alone.",1356912000,5,278,4.346153846153846
8534107,5,B0091G7980,"What a relief to see a movie set in Boston that doesn't overwhelm you with terrible attempts to recreate the accent, gratuitous cops and robbers action scenes, or shot after shot of Harvard Yard. ""Booster"" is moving, rhythmic, beautifully shot, and full of characters you can empathize with. Newcomers Nico Stone and Adam DuPaul were strong, and the addition of Seymour Cassel to the cast was a stroke of genius and/or luck for this ""little movie that could"". Highly recommended.",1355356800,2,479,5.0
8534108,5,B0091G7980,"A very beautiful sensitive story set against the gritty, edgy criminal scene of south Boston.

Guys and girls will like this film!",1355270400,,130,4.909090909090909
8534109,5,B0091G7980,You feel as if there was just a camera crew following these people. I like how its not an over the top Boston bank robbery movie. This feels like something that could actually happen.,1355097600,2,183,4.411764705882353
8534110,4,B0091G7980,"Well-written and full of gritty realism, this film is an excellent first time out for director Matt Ruskin and first-time actors Nico Stone and Adam DuPaul, among others. It's impressive to watch it and realize that these guys are just getting started. Just don't look for any shoot-outs or car chases--it's built instead around a moral dilemma and how an average person wrestles with that. Definitely look for more from this crew.",1355097600,2,431,5.0
8534111,5,B0091G7980,"This film was gritty, gripping and suspenseful.  The performances by the ""non-actors"" was much better than expected.
