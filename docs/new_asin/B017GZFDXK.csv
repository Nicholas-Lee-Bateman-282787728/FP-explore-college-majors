So says a top-ranking political consultant (paraphrasing anarchist Emma Goldman), when the consultant is sent to a war-torn country in South America to fine tune a faltering election. Director David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"") is working from an R-rated script (smoking and language) by Peter Straughan (""The Debt"") which in turn is based on Rachel Boynton's documentary by the same name.

Problem is, our heroine's long-term nemesis shows up with a conflicting goal. Trouble ensues.... As a political junkie, I got a huge kick out of all their dirty tricks.

  * Ann Dowd (""Masters of Sex"") Nell is the recruiter who convinces Jane to once again, enter the fray. Nell has connections....
  * Billy Bob Thornton (""The Judge"") Pat Candy has a history with Jane and doesn't hesitate to use it. This actor plays loathsome perfectly.
  * Anthony Mackie (""Avengers"") Ben is Jane's right-hand man, but sometimes the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing... Jane's strategies are out of left field and break all the rules.
  * Zoe Kazan (""Olive Kitteridge"") LeBlanc is the ultimate researcher. She's also multi lingual...what a treasure!

7504712,2,B017GZFDXK,"If there's any political insight to be found in David Gordon Green's razor thin Our Brand is Crisis, it's that American political campaigns are pretty awful, especially when they're in other countries. Not that this will come as news to anyone who has had to endure a Donald Trump or Ben Carson stump speech lately, but the campaigns are all about instilling as much fear into the voters as possible. Who cares what the candidate actually stands for? So how does that work when those tactics are applied to foreign elections? Like a bland, unfunny political movie that has been focus grouped to death, apparently.

Based loosely on Rachel Boynton's stellar award-winning documentary, Our Brand is Crisis is all about the dirty tactics waged by one American marketing firm during the Bolivian presidential election. Once again taking on the role of ""savior to brown people everywhere"" is Sandra Bullock as Jane Bodine, a strategist whose nickname ""Calamity Jane"" has been well-earned. After a series of major defeats she hit rock bottom and retired completely off the political grid, content in solitude and pottery projects. But that's before she's convinced to return and help lead the flagging campaign of Mitt Romney-esque Bolivian presidential candidate Pedro Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida). An ex-President who sold out the people to corporations, Castillo trails his opponent by 28 points largely because nobody trusts him.

So why would Bodine come back to bat for such a losing team? Because it gives her a chance to exact revenge on her greatest rival, Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton), who was hired by Castillo's opponent. Bodine and Candy are known for their dirty, totally immoral ""win at any costs"" tactics, but the simplified screenplay by Peter Straughan (Frank, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) draws a clear good guy vs. bad guy line in the sand. It's an approach he takes towards the entire story, perhaps in an effort to make the film as palatable to audiences as possible.

The thing is Our Brand is Crisis should be a very complex story about American interference in foreign elections, but it's just...not. Instead it's like Green used this as an opportunity to reconcile his somewhat schizophrenic career. This is the same guy who directed downbeat indie dramas such as George Washington and All the Real Girls before embracing R-rated low-brow comedies like The Sitter and Your Highness. While there are a few insightful moments in Our Brand is Crisis, mostly involving Castillo as he tries to be more than the corrupt politician he's been pegged to be, too much of the film is wildly out of sync tonally. There's a weird bus chase along a perilous roadway that comes out of nowhere, and a party/drug montage that might have been lifted straight from Pineapple Express, which Green also directed. Speaking of montages, they are too frequently used here as short hand for the desires of the Bolivian people, who don't come across particularly well here. It's like the Americans had to come in to teach them about their own government.

Bullock, Hollywood's go-to gal for a good ""white savior"" role, acquits herself nicely as the feisty, Sun Tzu-quoting Bodine.  Her role had originally been intended for a male actor, but producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov decided to go in a different direction, apparently so there could be some sexual tension or something. The rest of the cast don't fare as well. Mackie, Dowd, Scoot McNairy, and Zoe Kazan have little to do but play off of Bullock, while Thornton snivels his way through a role clearly based on top Democratic strategist James Carville.

The biggest problem with Our Brand is Crisis is that it's stuck in the limbo between being a serious political drama and a mainstream studio effort. This is best exemplified by the finale; an empty, crowd-pleasing gesture that feels like it was written by focus groups. There's a ton of great talent and a savvier political movie might have made good use of them, but instead the documentary remains the best telling of this particular story.",1448323200,8,4057,4.976401179941003
7504713,3,B017GZFDXK,"""Our Brand Is Crisis"" (2015 release; 107 min.) brings the story of ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine (played by Sandra Bullock). As the movie opens, Jane is discussed by a couple of campaigners who are driving up North to meet her, and we learn that Jane has been away from politics for 6 years and lost the previous four campaigns she was involved in. Yet they are desperate enough to convince her to come aboard. The candidate? A Senator in Bolivia who is down by 28 points. On top of that, the leader in the polls has hired how own US campaign consultant (played by Billy Bob Thornton). At this point we're 15 minute into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments, as noted in the movie's opening credits, the movie is ""suggested by the documentary by Rachel Boynton"" (from 2005). The movie is directed by David Gordon Green, best known fir ""Joe"" and ""Pineapple Express"". While the 2005 documentary was a riveting look at how American-style politics might (or might not) work in a place like Bolivia, the 2015 movie version cannot make up its mind whether to be a comedy, a satire or a drama. It has some elements of all three but in the end it isn't funny enough (even though there are a couple of very funny moments), or biting enough to resonate. The movie is saved by Sandra Bullock, who oozes charm and charisma, and Billy Bob Thornton, as his rival. The scenes in which they directly interact are stellar. Snarls Thornton to Bullock: ""when you play long enough with the monsters, you become a monster"", ha! The movie also lacks a surprising amount of character development. Do we really know all that much more about 'Calamity' Jane at the end of the movie? .

""Our Brand Is Crisis"" opened nationwide the weekend before this, and even though I had my doubts that it could live up to the original documentary, I nevertheless decided to check it out. The Saturday matin&eacute;e screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was nicely attended, somewhat to my surprise to be honest. If you haven't seen the 2005 documentary of the same name, I would strongly encourage you to check that out before you see this. Even though the facts in the documentary are now 13 years old, it remains a must-see film about politics and campaigning. The 2015 fictional version is not a must-see, but it makes for an interesting exercise to compare the documentary against the fictional version.",1446940800,10,2484,4.630385487528344

Calamity Jane Bodine is one of those characters you can love right away. She takes no prisoners, died her own thing, fights with her candidate when they do not follow her orders. Her candidate has the fight of his career, and is restless, thinks he knows what is best. However, Bodine knows this is a tough fight ahead with her opponent, Billy Bob Thornton. Who looks and acts like a recent political strategist, James Carville. He is a dirty player and in Bolivia all vets are off. The end of the campaign is surprising, but we needed it.

The acting and script are first rate, but the film bogged down and did not have as much oomph as needed.

7504753,3,B017GZFDXK,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Our Brand is Crisis is based on the 2005 documentary of the same name, which followed the participation of James Carville's consulting firm in the 2002 Bolivian campaign for president. Here, Sandra Bullock plays Jane Bodine, a fictionalized version of Carville, called out of semi- retirement, following a declining career as a campaign manager. Like Carville, she accepts the challenge to manage the presidential campaign of Pedro Castillo, a former president who leans to the right on the political spectrum. Bodine's nemesis, Pat Candy (portrayed as deeply cynical in Billy Bob Thornton's performance) represents the populist candidate, Rivera, who is way ahead at the beginning of the campaign in a three-way race.

Sandra Bullock is a little better here in some of her previous comic roles (e.g. The Proposal, The Heat), as the initially burnt out Bodine, only engaging in her usual pratfalls (this time it's throwing up all over the place after arriving in Bolivia), at the beginning of the film, and later settling down as a determined strategist, who eventually outfoxes her aforementioned nemesis, Pat Candy.

How far will Bodine go in manipulating the public's view of Castillo? This is essentially what keeps our interest as the narrative progresses to the climaxthe results of the campaign for president. First Bodine notes that Castillo, with his flat demeanor, is unable to make a personal connection to the electorate. Eventually she softens him up so that he appears to be more emotionally accessible. The team concludes that Castillo must sell the idea to the Bolivian people that the country is in a ""crisis,"" and Castillo is just the man to fix the dire problems facing the country.

Bodine urges Castillo to adopt smear tactics against his opponent but the high-minded candidate refuses. It's only after Rivera smears Castillo regarding a long-ago extra-marital affair that Castillo relents and allows Bodine to adopt similar tactics. One of those strategies involves publicizing a photo of Rivera, with a Nazi war criminal, standing in the background.

Perhaps the most dramatic moment in the film occurs when rocks are thrown at Castillo's campaign bus, forcing it to stop in a small town, where angry indigenous people are protesting the possibility that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) may be allowed into the country. Castillo gets out of the bus and confronts the protesterspromising that the IMF will not be accepted without a referendum.

There is also a sub-plot involving Eduardo, a campaign volunteer, who feels connected to Castillo, since a photo was taken of him and the former president on the earlier campaign trail, when he was a child. Eduardo's family members don't share his enthusiasm for Castillo and castigate him for his allegiance to the right-wing candidate.

As the film's antagonist, Pat Candy has little screen time, and his confrontations with Bodine mainly amount to a series of conversations that are well-written but don't raise any stakes. The most dramatic of these interactions between the two campaign managers occurs when Bodine tricks Candy into having his candidate reference a quotation attributed to Goebbels, Hitler's vile propaganda minister.

When Castillo finally wins the election by the slimmest of margins, he goes back on his promise to hold a referendum on the IMF, alienating even Eduardo, one of his most ardent supporters. And Bodine, after informing Eduardo that she wasn't responsible for Castillo's deception regarding his campaign promise, later joins him in an unlikely show of solidarity with the people she worked against during the campaign.

Our Brand is Crisis is thoroughly watchable despite a dearth of big dramatic moments and a significant antagonist that propels the action forward. It has been said that the film lost money because it was inaccurately billed as a comedy. Maybe so, but this dramedy is worth at least one look.",1472256000,,3964,5.210361067503925

this.  Of course, the indirect references to the USA elections are obvious, although people
in the USA do not demonstrate in mass any longer for true political goals
The only common theme that exists worldwide, and maybe is one that the creators of the
film wanted intentionally people to think off, are the ever willing politicians to do things other
than what the people want (they are children after all) and the ever present security forces that
we try to subdue the cooperation of the people.

Eerily, watching Our Brand Is Crisis had me wondering how the movie may have parallels in American society and the relation to media coverage.

7504795,3,B017GZFDXK,"Like numerous films before it, this one adds various elements of political satire, humanistic drama, and rise of the underdog along with basic comedy into a shaker.  What spills out is a not totally successful story.  Sandra Bullock plays Jane Bodine, a fictional character based on real life events provided in Rachel Boyntons documentary from 2005.  In her professional life she was a not always successful political campaign manager.  It led her to a graduate course in the 12 Step Program and a reclusive life in wilds of Idaho (or Montana or somewhere hard to get to).

Shes called upon to join the campaign of a man running for the presidency of Bolivia.  Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) is well down in the polls which is led by a candidate managed by Janes political enemy Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton).  Jane reluctantly accepts the assignment based on the revenge factor.  Candy has always out maneuvered her in campaigns and may have had a hand in her bouts with alcoholism and depression.  Once in Bolivia, Castillo slowly picks up steam fueled by the language of crisis permeating the government.  I was surprised no one came out with red baseball hats shouting Lets make Bolivia great again.

The bitter byplay between Calamity Jane and Candy is often fun to watch as are some of the dirty tricks each play on the other.  The film seems to fall apart once Jane follows one of her local campaign workers nicknamed Eddie (Reynaldo Pacheco) home to find how he and his 2 brothers live a life of poverty and repression which is not uncharacteristic in the country.  This softness seems to detract from the satirical meanness I thought the film was going for.  We do learn that Bolivia has adopted numerous elements of American politics.  That is, dirty tricks, lies, deception, manipulation and corruption.

The Blu ray comes with 1080p video resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Surprisingly, the movie is shot on film but it is so well resolved, it could pass for digital.  It looks great, with excellent color rendition and excellent detail.  An easy demonstration can be found from the opulent home where Castillo resides to the slum conditions that Eddie inhabits.  The audio options includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also excellent.  The mix includes some nice surround effects of various street scenes as well as a terrific race between 2 buses negotiating a mountain road.  The musical score is very good as well and comes through with excellent fidelity.  Dialog is well placed and easily understood.  Subtitles come in Portuguese, Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include an 11 minute piece on Bullocks character and the redemptive arc that drives the story.  There are also a couple of trailers.",1462752000,2,2741,4.891540130151844

I was quite surprised to find myself hooked and even more surprised when it was over as I realized that I liked it enough I would watch it again - maybe even more than once. I am a cynic when it comes to politics, having been worn down by the bread and circus act here in the USA so I was not surprised at all by what was portrayed in this film and a little (pleasantly) surprised that 'Hollywood' was allowed to put that much TRUTH into one of their productions. This is probably an independent film - so perhaps that is why.  The film was thoughtful, thought-provoking, and filmed in an edgy / gritty style that I think was meant to capture the feeling of the small South American country election that was it's subject matter.

I t is good to see Sandra not always being cutesy even if she is cute. She is finally playing her age.

Billy Bob Thornton id just being himself and it is difficult to tell where he stops and his character starts.

Joaquim de Almeida is an excellent and very believable actor.  See him again as Francisco d'Anconia in Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Gault.

Here's the thing: we didn't care about any of this. The acting all around was okay, but no character endeared himself/herself to us. We were not given an opportunity to care if Senator Castillo makes a good running against opponents. Of course, we see that Jane's strategy works and yet, we still didn't care. Even Pat Candy's interruptions to Jane's plans do not sway us. We just didn't care.

With all the problems the United States has, why, in the world would, we care about an election in Bolovia, especially since this was not a true story? And even if this was a true story (there was no indication on the DVD that this was a true story or some-such) we still didn't care. Why indeed.

A bunch of people telling you what you want to hear so they can get elected and the electorate being held back from learning the truth by spin masters for hire.
I do have to admit that I probably would give most anything Sandra Bullock appears in a rating of four or higher unless the supporting cast really screws the movie up.",1457568000,2,398,4.25

7504913,3,B017GZFDXK,"When I look at a film and I am asked to rate it I think back to what stands out the most. Was it the characters that where fleshed out so much that I wasn't reminded or thinking in anyway of other characters an actor might have played in the past. Was it the story line, something new and refreshing, something that is ""based on"" to historical fact or an event but runs so close to the actual event that your not taken for a fool. Perhaps it was just so entertaining that you sat back and enjoyed yourself for the hour and half or so that it took to watch it that you really didn't care about all the other. This film just slightly missed on all of the above.

Sandra Bullock's character was good, but I could see more than once another past character of hers coming to mind during a scene. Same with Billy Bob Thornton, he seemed to have rolled quite a few of his characters into this performance. As I am sitting here writing this I remember there actual names, but for the life of me I can't remember the characters names. It should be the opposite, or at the very least I should remember the character's names.  What I do remember is at times a clunky version of many films or bits of films put together. How many movies start from the point of view of a character being asked a question in an interview and you are transported ""back in time"" to the very beginning where it all started. How many times have you had two characters spar back in forth in a dark comedy sort of way, or someone having to be persuaded out of retirement to comes save the day, or they had melt down and went into hiding away from everything and you have shots of a car driving through what seems like endless landscape to find them. How many times....how many times. That is what this film is. A bunch of scenes from other movies mushed together into this story. A bunch of characters from past roles of the actors mushed into this film. It's an ok film, but I feel like I have seen it all before including the ending.",1456876800,,1999,4.230366492146596

7504917,3,B017GZFDXK,"I didn't really have high expectations with this movie after reading a variety of reviews but I didn't think this was as bad as some reviews I read.  On the other hand, I wouldnt call this a great movie either.  In a lot of ways this is a typical political drama but there are no real surprises here as the movie is very predictable with a rather mediocre conclusion.  To me this movies director couldn't make up their mind on what this movie was supposed to be as it tries at times to be a drama and other times a comedy.  It really doesnt do either particularly well as the comedy portions are few with really the highlights being between Bullock and Thornton in the second half of the movie.  Those two actors really saved the movie for me as the story was definitely not very well written with a rather mundane plot.  There are long stretches of really monotonous dialogue that does little to move the movie along and the movie to me felt too long even though it was only 1 hour and 47 minutes.  Unfortunately, the lack of a clear direction in what the movie was trying to be and a weakly written story cripple the chemistry between Bullock and Thornton and make this a rather mediocre movie.

7504941,4,B017GZFDXK,"Director David Gordon Green has absorbed the story (screenplay by Peter Straughan based on Rachel Boyntons documentary) and in addition to creating a tense film about political corruption in Bolivia, he places before the public the corrupt tricky shenanigans inherent in US politics that we are watching daily on television and other sources of media manipulation as the contenders for presidential candidate throw even more crude moments our way. It is well-timed film  if only people will take the time to watch it.

The plot is well summarized: In 2002, Bolivian politician Pedro Gallo hires American James Carville's political consulting firm, Greenberg Carville Shrum, to help him win the 2002 Bolivian presidential election. GCS brings in Jane Bodine (Sandra Bullock) to manage the campaign in Bolivia. Battling her arch nemesis, the opposition's political consultant Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton), Bodine successfully uses American political campaign strategies to lead Gallo (Joaquim de Almeida) to victory against Victor Rivera (Louis Arcella). The depths to which these manipulators stoop are at first surprising until we realize that politics is a game run by media writers and crisis managers and money. Then we feel privy to the rotten side of political campaigns and realize we are all watching it live at this moment.

An eye opener  or is it? The performances by Bullock, Thornton, and de Almeida are excellent as are those by the supporting cast, which includes Anthony Mackie, Ann Dowd, Dominic Flores, and impressive newcomer Reynaldo Pacheco.

Worthy of your attention if you can tolerate the undressing of politics. Grady Harp, February 16",1456531200,,1661,5.3486590038314175

7505020,2,B017GZFDXK,"Our Brand Is Crisis is about a right-wing Bolivian presidential candidate failing badly in the polls who enlists the aid of an American management team, led by burned-out strategist Calamity Jane Bodine (Sandra Bullock). In self-imposed retirement following a scandal, Jane is coaxed back into the game for the chance to beat her professional nemesis, Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton), now working for the opposition, and to restore her reputation.

Director David Gordon Green attempts to mix political drama and broad comedy  an attempt that comes up short. Though based on a 2005 documentary of the same name, it rings terribly false. Not even the considerable star power of Bullock and Thornton could save it. Though both actors do their best, they are working with an uninspired script and never appear comfortable in their roles. Bullock, in particular, seems sometimes to be channeling Meryl Streep, other times Lucille Ball. For the first half hour, her character wallows in self-pity, which becomes irritating pretty fast.

The story is the key problem. Americans managing a South American election isn't exactly a plot that will have audiences flocking. And theres not enough to distinguish the film and motivate audiences to get on board. Effective supporting performances by Anthony Mackie, Joaquin de Almeida, and Reynaldo Pacheco are not enough to raise the overall quality of the picture.

The only bonus extra on the Blu-ray release is the featurette Sandra Bullock: A Role Like No Other, which chronicles Bullocks challenge to the filmmakers to change the films lead role from male to female and her collaboration with director Green to develop the character.",1454112000,,1674,5.235074626865671
7505021,4,B017GZFDXK,"""If you fight with monsters for too long, you become a monster."" Jane (Bullock) is a political consultant who has took herself out of the game. When she is hired by a presidential candidate in Bolivia she is on the fence, until she sees Pat Candy (Thornton), a rival that has beaten her over and over again. As hard as she tries not to, Jane falls further and further into negativity and as her and Candy battle it out only one outcome is possible. I really loved this movie, but I am also a political science major so I may be a little biased. The movie actually shows what I think is probably exactly what goes on behind the scenes. The most revealing thing is that both consultants never once thought about if the candidate they are helping should be in charge. That is scary and most likely exactly how it actually is. I really enjoyed this a lot, but again though, I am a political science major and the movie was very political. Overall, very good and I recommend it, but may not be for everyone. I give it a high B+.",1454112000,,1023,4.305699481865285

7505024,5,B017GZFDXK,"The film claims to be ""inspired by true events"" but is closer to a work of total fiction and is designed to make us look at our own candidates in an election year who claim there is a crisis and they are the only ones who can fix it.

The movie is entertaining as the quirky and unorthodox  Jane Bodine (Sandra Bullock) is hired by a Bolivian senator in a presidential bid. Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) is ""not trustworthy, not likable, stuck up little a-hole."" He also has a smirk and connections to the IMF. Bodine takes on the job because her opponent is managed by Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) a master strategist who has beaten Bodine on several occasions.

Castiilo's lack of charm is changed into being a forceful individual who can get the job done in what is now a ""time of crisis.""  Bodine has a history with Candy as the campaign becomes personal. This is an interesting behind the scenes view of campaigns filled with humor and universal political themes.

Good job Bullock.
