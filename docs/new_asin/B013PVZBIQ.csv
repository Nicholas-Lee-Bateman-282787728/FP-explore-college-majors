7370508,4,B013PVZBIQ,"Not the Edge of Seventeen but Drown!

This is a tough film to watch, but I couldn't peel myself away from it. Definitely makes you think. You will either identify with Len or appreciate that you don't. Everyone has their demons and struggles but you only know your own. Worth watching but it's yet another film offered free elsewhere.",1450656000,3,334,4.661016949152542
7370509,5,B013PVZBIQ,"Len is top dog at his surf club; he is the winner of everything and an alpha male with attitude. His mates are all macho grand standing rugger bugger types who tick all the relevant clich boxes and expect him to do likewise. He is also a top life saver and has a penchant for Budgie smugglers. His best mate is called Meat in reference to him being overly endowed in the trouser department and is a simple soul who does what Len tells him.

Then new kid turns up and saves a life on his first day and then starts to steal Lens thunder. This is Phil  Jack Mathews of Neighbours fame. Phil is also gay and on a drunken night out things come to a head  no pun intended. Len is jealous of and apparently both attracted and repelled by this new man. The problem is the old adage of in vino veritas hangs true  but not everyone can accept their truths.

Now this is just excellent; Matt Levett as Len is exceptional as the troubled sports star and brings a menace to the screen that is tempered by the fear and loathing that make up his complex character. As Quentin Crisp said some roughs are pretty queer and some queers are pretty rough this can certainly be applied to Len. The use of editing is brilliant and adds to the immediacy of the whole piece. There is a constant throb of homo eroticism that intermingles with the ordinariness of what is actually happening and juxtaposes all the emotions that the players are going through.

The cinematography is truly brilliant too and that is by Dean Francis who co-edited; so I hope to see more good stuff from him. Please don't get me wrong, this is a hard watch in places and is painfully visceral when it needs to be; but I really appreciate cinema that pushes the boundaries  can illicit emotion and leaves you feeling that you have seen something special  absolutely recommended.",1445040000,15,1829,4.4226190476190474

7370515,5,B013PVZBIQ,"Incredible movement in time for those who have experienced actions against themselves for simply being who they are.  I have not experienced such.  However, I have rescued friends who have.  Many people who act out against those who prefer the same sex prefer the same sex themselves.  However, they are unable to accept their feelings.  Many are to the point of mental death because of society within their family.  The preceding mention of society does not include society outside of their family.  I'll end my comment at this time.",1457222400,,534,4.932584269662922

7370518,3,B013PVZBIQ,"Dark disturbing drama about a man who cannot live with who he is deep down and another man tormented for how he lives his life. This film is sad and scary at times and not for the weak of heart. Good acting with a very attractive cast this movie is all about Len and Phil and the lives they lead. One man who comes from a very homophobic background and is fighting who he is and putting up a front filled with heavy drinking and violence the other is just leading his life and having to survive the brutality that is this prestigious Australian swim club.

I actually had to look up the ending online as it was a little confusing but it explained everything and then everything made sense to me.
Nice movie, sometimes the dialogue is a little hard to understand and the scenes sometimes hard to watch but a good movie none the less.",1455494400,3,832,4.2993630573248405
7370519,3,B013PVZBIQ,"The film is well made, but has an unbalanced soundtrack (background noise is louder than dialogue for instance).

7370523,4,B013PVZBIQ,"This highly awarded LGBT film festival movie is remotely reminiscent of A Star Is Born theme where one who was at the top of their profession and falls from grace while another ascends to the coveted top position.  Yet this story is set in the world of a tight-knit, super-macho Australian lifeguard club where two Alpha male protagonists compete in physical contests and psychological game of wills.  Right away we see long reigning lifeguard, Len, played superbly by Matt Levett get dethroned by handsome jock and somewhat closeted but newly coupled lifeguard, Phil (Jack Matthews).  Len begrudgingly invites winner Phil for a celebration night out with fellow mates that ultimately ends up in personal revelations and tragic disaster.  This final incident is cinematically intercut with flashbacks and character backstories that includes supporting male leads who affects their lives, namely boyfriend Tom (Sam Anderson) and lifeguard best buddy 'Meat' (out actor, Harry Cook).  A defeated Len is consumed with deep rage and both longings and loathing for another man by his fantasies to the point of homophobic bullying and masochistic behavior.  Conversely, unapologetic co-protagonist, Phil subtly and subversively exposes Len's conflicted homosexual yearnings.  At first viewing the lead character's behavior may seem overboard and exaggerated and therefore this story can easily be dismissed as thematic retread.  Also for me Aussie accents were always difficult to understand.  But after switching on the subtitles it brought me clarity to the mental complexities to these visually stunning yet flawed characters.  To add, my major problem with Drown was the close adherence to the original stage play dialogue.  It definitely needed some rewrites and tightening up for film.  That being said, initially this is not an easy film to sit through.  However, the depth of the story can be better appreciated if viewed with patience, particularly with subtitles on as the layered plot artfully unfolds and progresses...most of all the manly visuals do not disappoint!  A Special Features cinematic discussion on the making of Drown is included and worth watching.",1452643200,6,2167,5.429850746268657

7370525,1,B013PVZBIQ,Stupidest movie I've ever seen.  The ridiculous drama because one guy can't face the fact that he is attracted to another guy.  So he stares a lot drinks a lot and fights a lot and wants to kill and bury the guy he is attracted to cause he can't face the fact that he likes men?!?!  STUPID!  Way over the top silly.  In this day and age to get that worked up over a same sex attraction and attempt to bury someone alive over it....ridiculous in the extreme.  Waste of your time.,1452124800,4,478,4.141304347826087
7370526,1,B013PVZBIQ,"Wow.  What a waste.  A good cast, beautiful art direction and cinematography WASTED on a EXTREMELY dated story line.  This is NOT ORIGINAL in the least.  Just a surf-recasting of the self-loathing closet case into extreme brutal bondage abuse.  Ugh.  Just tired of this crap.  Vito Russo was writing about this forty years ago and it's depressing to know that so much capital and talent is wasted on these kinds of stories.",1451865600,6,423,4.791666666666667

This movie is a perfect example of how self loathing, crazy, bullying closeted homo psychos are made by their fathers, they are not born this way. Show me a homophobic bully & I'll show you how daddy made him that way.

I watched this because of a HGSANTOS music video depicting a gay couple in this story. The gay couple could have been left out of this freak show.",1515369600,,505,4.315789473684211

8728490,3,B013PVZBIQ,"Drown is a 2015 Australian LGBT drama directed by Dean Francis, who also contribute to the screenplay of the film. Other screenplay credits go to Stephen Davis, as the movie is also based on a play Davis wrote. The movie tried to go the Indiegogo route, but it appears the crowdfunding effort had not been successful at the time.

The movie focuses on the world of competitive Surf Lifesaving and its current champion, Len (Matt Levett). But things change when the younger Phil (Jack Matthews) arrives at the club and starts to make waves within the group. It's clear that he;s going to be a contender in future competitions, and this clearly upsets Len to some degree. It is also revealed that Phil is gay, which presents another potential complication for things.

But over time Len's feelings of competitiveness and jealousy also lead to some confusing moments when he seems to be developing feelings of some sort for Phil. But once Phil finally takes the championship at the annual surf competition, this somehow pushes Len over the edge. Thus he and his buddy Meat (Harry Cook) decides to take Phil out for drinks together to celebrate the victory. But things take a sinister turn as Len starts to vent his frustrations in an increasingly physical manner with Meat oddly helpless to stop him.

Drown was designed to be a movie about bullying and it decided to address this in a highly dynamic but sometimes confusing sequencing that has you as the viewing gets different parts of the story and seemingly random intervals. I'm sure there's potentially some greater relevance for why which part went where, but I think it's still fair to say that things could have been handled in a tighter, slightly more linear manner.

But as you get all the pieces, you will walk away with the ingredients for a rather complete story. You'll see bits of Len's past and you'll witness moments of his history that may explain his need to assert himself through bullying. You'll see some of Phil's life with his boyfriend and how he got caught up in everything. And ultimately you'll see the chain of events that led to the tragic night for the three of them.

Meat is sadly that character who just can't say no to his friend. We repeatedly see him as part of the action but not necessarily one with his own agency in things. He's there but he's not. He mostly follows what Len has to say, as is the case with many bullies who are alpha-type individuals who gather weaker followers to bolster themselves.

As much as I felt some of the acting in the more mundane bits felt a little flat and awkward at times, I have to give credit to what the actors had to go through for the more serious and intense parts of the story. There's no way any of that could have been easy and I even just acting through the events could have been at least a little disturbing and potentially traumatizing. But the team behind this movie had a serious message to deliver and they managed this with quite the heavy story indeed.

I guess that's my only problem with this movie - at times it feels too heavy or something along those lines. The director gives you little to no rest with all the tension in the film. And this is especially true since events are not told in sequence - so we are repeatedly brought back to the ""present"" of the movie, which is that one big bender and the final scene on the beach. And as much as the early bits about the beach were already heavy, it actually gets worse as you get into the second half of the film. We're talking some really serious stuff.

Drown is certainly a movie with a somewhat heavy-handed message, but they were well-intentioned and I think they quite adequately achieved their goals here. Sure we all could have used some relief, but that might have impacted the overall tone of things.",1472947200,,3805,4.568914956011731
8728491,4,B013PVZBIQ,"Great acting, amazing cinematography, excellent storyline. Plus its has a thrill of a ride that I like in a film. Keep you on the edge of your sofa!",1470009600,,148,4.321428571428571
