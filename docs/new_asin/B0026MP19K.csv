8353239,1,B0026MP19K,"Maybe 15-20 minutes in, I muted and went to bed. Scroungy old women reeking of desperation to relive their misspent youth (should have been enough, but I just had to keep trying to find something redeemable, didn't I?)-- gah. From what I can gather, said youth was spent staring at a spinning laundry basket under which sat a hundred watt light bulb. I was just beginning to wonder what had them so excited when I was uncomfortably presented with one of these scroungy woman  moaning pleasurarably... her formidable, seventy-something bulk shuddering at the mere sight of it (uh...... >ew!<).

Inventor interview is pseudo-scientifically hilarious: ""Something-something-something-eh-neurobiology. Something-something-something-eh-ehhhhh-sciency-stuff-and-thangs"". This guy is batspit crazy. As a student of the sciences I was laughing with the disillusioned lab guy who, building the thing according to spec, was flabbergasted as to the point of it.
 ""Ahhhhh I see"" he declares condescendingly ""You close your EYES"". Then he looks at somebody off camera with an expression of complete disgust.
I'm with ya, brother.
The music was painfully attempting recreate how it feels when you actually DO take the brown acid, and the  William Burroughs relationship slant was icky. Overall, I leave the thing thinking that the only thing worse than wanna-be avante garde hucksters is ancient, looks like it's stinky, rehashed wanna be avant garde hucksters. You'll find more culture watching streamed episodes of Family Guy for a good twelve hours straight.
This was gross.",1450137600,,1562,5.523012552301255

8353243,3,B0026MP19K,"Brion Gysin was an artist in Beat circles who created a remarkable kind of strobe light that can cause hallucinations. The Dreamachine, as the device came to be known, is experienced with the eyes closed, and its 8-13Hz oscillation is said to resonate with the brain's alpha waves. Though the curious drugless high made a big splash with some of the 1960s counterculture (John Lennon is said to have used one often), it never broke through to wider society. FLicKeR is Nik Sheehan's 2008 documentary on the machine and its inventor.

Sheehan presents the machine's impact through extensive interviews, and a lot more public figures out there have used this obscure device then I would have thought: Lee Renaldo of Sonic Youth, socialite Leila Hadley Luce, Marianne Faithfull, Genesis P-Orridge, DJ Spooky, Kenneth Anger, John Giorno, Iggy Pop, Ira Cohen, and French philosopher Catherine Cl&eacute;ment. Neurologist Bastiaan ter Meulen gives a scientific background for the machine's effects. There is archival footage of Gysin and William S. Burroughs. Of course one cannot have first-hand experience of the Dreamachine from a documenty, but there are some visual effects meant to give an idea of the colourful visions it creates.

There is plenty of background on Gysin's life as an artist, how the machine was invented, why it was never successfully marketed (it can cause epilepsy in those prone to it!), and how artists in the decades since have made their own from mimeographed step-by-step instructions.

The documentary does run overlong and at one point Genesis P-Orridge seems to take over with his/her own ideas of art distinct from Gysin, and then there is a digression on the medieval Islamic sect of the assassins (with a major factual error). At 75 minutes, it could have easily been edited down to one hour without losing anything. Furthermore, twenty wingwangs is a bit much for a single documentary of this length. Gysin was a fascinating artist, but this documentary might be better left to those unusually passionate about the Beats or the Sixties counterculture.",1401062400,3,2083,5.1386430678466075
