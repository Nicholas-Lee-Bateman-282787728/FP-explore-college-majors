8563866,2,B00B81NS40,"This film was a complete waste of 5.00! Yes, I am serious it wasn't worth five dollars. This film could have been much better if they would have done a straight up documentary featuring the girl's stories, training and dieting regimes, and more background on the sport and Master Toddy .

 However, the cheesy writing and the inevitable cheesy acting that came with it were hard to endure. The music in the film was loud and annoying and the cock-fighting scene was cruel and unnecessary! The girls were beautiful and definitely athletes especially Gina, but I found them less beautiful as the film drug on due to their enjoyment of cruel sports like cock-fighting and their somewhat insensitive attitude to the poor women in Thailand .

 The Americans dominated every person they fought. I find this hard to believe, but then again it wasn't a documentary it was a film/documentary. It would have been better to either make a film or make a documentary .The combination was awful! I was hoping this would be more like Pumping Iron 2: The Woman--which I definitely recommend! This film ultimately blew big time!",1431993600,5,1111,4.831578947368421
8563867,5,B00B81NS40,"This is a great movie with some scenes of boxing, but was kind of slow sometimes and would have been helped if it was produced with a bigger budget like some of Gina Carano's other great films, including Into the Blood and Haywire, both of which were awesome movies. Overall, though, this movie is worth watching at least once, especially for Gina Carano fans.",1419465600,4,360,4.640625
