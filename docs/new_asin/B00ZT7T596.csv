8720862,3,B00ZT7T596,"Despite it being a type of ""misery"" movie, it didn't fall into laziness. The writing was okay, it definitely could have had some better dialog. The acting was amazing, totally believable, which i didn't think at first. Also it's not technically a slasher, unless i'm just used to copious amounts of horror violence, and this had some  brutal moments, but i wouldn't classify is slasher.
It basically about a girl, Ana, who wants to make some money to go on a graduation celebration trip. So her on again off again boyfriend sees an ad for a babysitter wanted. So Ana goes, and discovers it's not a typical babysitting job, for one it's not a child. I basically re-stated everything amazon/any reviewer says.
I do want to say from a filming standpoint, it is beautiful, every camera angle was thought out, the lighting is perfect! . That sounds really weird to say, but it was a well-filmed movie, i just wish the writing was better, the ending was a complete let-down, but that is up to you.",1454803200,2,991,4.630681818181818

8720867,4,B00ZT7T596,"""Para Elisa"" is a pretty stereotypical nightmare scenario that is very familiar to most horror fans. It is kind of a ""fly in the spider web"" situation. The lead character, Ana, is a typical college kid looking for a job. Unfortunately this leads her into the clutches of a house of horrors. The characters are developed nicely, the killers more so than the poor Ana. They are cliches of archetypes found in numerous horror films, and thrillers, but Fernandez does an amazing job at keeping the story interesting enough to pull you into the film, and connect with the characters. The cinematography is a key factor in this ability to give ""Para Elisa"" the right amount of macabre to keep you on edge.

The special effects are not all that inventive, or gut-wrenching. The suggestive nature of the act that puts these effects into play, however, are very gut-wrenching. The true visceral nightmare that makes ""Para Elisa"" work is the way that Fernandez makes us relate to the traumatic situation that Ana is in, and the horrors she endures at the hands of a truly deranged Elisa-the real Antagonist of the movie. The torture/kill scenes never really get gory, or visceral enough for me personally. Not that they are any less effective in telling the story, I just would have really fell in love with ""Para Elisa"" had the actual horror elements been captured on camera, and forced me to endure the visual carnage and brutality. I just wish that Juanra Fernandez would have embraced a bit more splatter-gore with this one.

Overall ""Para Elisa"" is a nice, well produced horror film. It is a worthy film for any horror fan to enjoy- and in my personal opinion, this one is one of the better import horrors that I have seen in a while. A word of caution-the scenes that don't deal with Ana and Elisa do drag the energy of ""Para Elisa"" down some, not much but it is noticeable. And even though the characters are just the right amount of tortured and the right amount of psychotic, they are redundant in the horrorsphere so not all who watch the movie will be pleased. I for one liked it enough to recommend it.",1442102400,5,2104,4.622994652406417
8720868,3,B00ZT7T596,"Man, this movie really boils my blood. First, everything about it was so well done; great performances by the entire cast, nice practical effects, insane story that is interesting and unique...and then it ends. Literally, you have a movie that's running time is 115 minutes, and it's a roller coaster from beginning to end, and then....that's it? The ending was so unsatisfying, that it ruins the effectiveness of the rest of the film. I mean, why make such an interesting movie that is so intense to have it end in a whimper? Did they run out of money? Were the actors replaced? Were people really dying so they couldn't film an actual ending? I mean, it makes no conceivable sense! Watch this movie as solely an exercise in futility; you will be just as angry at the end as I was.",1442016000,7,782,4.553191489361702
8720869,4,B00ZT7T596,"Awesome movie ! I think this movie was well done , it did kept me  on my seat with suspense & wondering what is gonna happen & how will end ....
