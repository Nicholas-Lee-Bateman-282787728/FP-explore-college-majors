778093,5,6304074743,"After licensing restrictions forced Chow Yun-Fat fans to look to Hong Kong for these 2 fine films, the gods of DVD have finally smiled and given us  the nod.  For the uninitiated, these 2 movies are quite possibly Chow  Yun-Fat's 2 best.  In my opinion, if you would have added A Better  Tomorrow, you would have had the trifecta.  But this is properly a John Woo  box set, and rightfully so, as he has much to do with the movies' huge  success, acclaim, and popularity.  Do yourself a favor and don't judge Woo  from his American efforts (FaceOff, Mission Impossible 2), use these 2 fine  films as the real yardstick and you will not be disappointed.
If you are  looking to get into Hong Kong cinema, or just want a change from the  typical bloated Hollywood fare, then I would highly recommend getting this  box set.  Both the acting (CYF) and the filmmaking (JW) are top notch.  Not  to mention the event of merely being able to obtain them for a reasonable  price.",966384000,4,968,4.497109826589595
778094,5,6304074743,"When I heard that ""The Killer""  and ""Hard Boiled""  were finally going to be reissued, I was jumping for joy.  Finally  Criterion sold or lost the rights.  I was all set to pre order these two  movies separately when I came up on this boxed set.  You can have two GREAT  Hong Kong action films for under $40!  This is simply a great deal.  If  you want to know more about the films, search for them on Amazon, they have  been discussed separately.  But trust me, this is a deal that is too good  to pass up!",965952000,2,506,4.082474226804123
778095,5,6304074743,"Hard Boiled is one of (if not THE) best action movie ever.  Woo's gunfights are like some kind of lethal, but beautiful, dance, especially the opening scene in the teahouse; I've yet to see a better action scene.  The Killer is a little more dramatic, but no less good for it.  I love the  way that Woo interweaves violence and religion, the last shootout in the  church is cool (this was probably the inspiration for the standoff in  Face/Off).  Of course, how could I forget Chow Yun Fat?  He is the man, and  although he is often typecast as the ""killer with a conscince"" I  haven't gotten tired of it (even in Anna and the King, he was a bad-a**).  If you thought Face/Off and Misson Impossible 2 were cool, The Killer and  Hard Boiled blows them away.",960768000,4,756,4.398550724637682
778157,5,6304074743,"This is an excellent, affordable deuce of John Woo classics.  They are an interesting pair, showing different facets of John Woo's directorial style.  While primarily known for his action,  I find John Woo more compelling for his ability to weave a good story and compelling characters into action scenes.  This is what separates his movies from the American equivalent.
""The Killer"" is a story driven, personal, Shakespearian epic of honor and loyalty.  Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee are flip sides of a coin, one a cop, the other a paid killer, who find themselves drawn into an unavoidable admiration for each other.  The violence in this film is poetic rather than gratuitous.  The ending is personal and the deaths are meaningful.  I find this to be the superior film.
""Hard Boiled"" is the counterbalance to ""The Killer.""  It is sheer, over the top violence. Shotguns fire the famous ""John Woo Bullets"" that  explode upon impact.  Sub machine guns never run out of ammo.  In this film, Chow Yun Fat is the hard boiled policeman and  Tony Leung Chiu Wai is an undercover agent that may have gone too far.  Like ""The Killer,""  these two dangerous characters gain a grudging respect for each other.  Unlike the ""The Killer,""  ""Hard Boiled"" finds it's big finish in a Hollywood style extravaganza of blood and bullets on a major scale.
Again, this is a really great package with interesting commentary and a few features.  Who knew that John Woo's films are influenced by the American musical?  I recommend ""A Better Tomorrow"" to follow up this great set.",982540800,7,1553,4.8143939393939394
778158,5,6304074743,"If you're into action movies and, especially Hong Kong action films starring the kickass Chow Yun Fat, then this set is for you. The video and audio are both really excellent, and it is probably the best two versions of these films released over here in the US to date, in my opinion, in terms of overall value and quality. The films are just great, especially the Killer, my favorite John Woo film to date. It's well worth the money, and you get two quality DVDs for a relatively low price. Definitely give this one a go.",974678400,2,522,4.391752577319588
778159,5,6304074743,"I don't understand this at all. While I know that these are the greatest action movies made so far on film, the sound transfer is mono.
It won't deter the action, or your appreciation of John Woo's genius. But if you do want the DVD Dolby 5.1, surround sound versions, you need to find the MEI AH Laser Company copies of these films.
There is no commentary, just the film itself. But the video transfer has the same quality.

778160,4,6304074743,"I won't get into a movie review, but I though I should say something about the DVDs.  Each disc is not full of extras but what is there ranks up in quality with most DVDs.  The main problem with the discs is the sound and film quality.  Voices are muted compared to the background sound.  The film is definitely not digitally remastered as can be noticed in the beginning of the films, where there are noticeable scratches.  Maybe the master was low quality, I don't know.  For me, the defects became less noticeable as I was drawn into the story.  Bottom line:  I thought they were worth the price, but if the defects will bother you (because we expect the highest quality from a DVD) then wait and hope for another release.",971481600,,725,4.4393939393939394

778163,5,6304074743,"True masterpieces of the action genre, John Woo's early stuff is definitely going to be his best. With this action packed, operatic like  film, Woo seriously manages to stage some of the coolest action sequences  ever caught on film. As with all Woo films, there is always the well done  characterization with Yun-Fat as the sympathetic hitman in The Killer and  good guy cop in Hard Boiled. Standouts are at the end of the films with  some really illustrative shootouts.",968716800,,471,4.8375
778164,5,6304074743,"If you have heard much talk about Woo's movies, but you have yet to  experience any for yourself, then these two movies are *BY FAR* the best  examples of his work you could wish for.
For the uninitiated, John Woo's  movies always bear the same credentials, and these two are no exception:  Non-Stop, masterfully realized action, and a terrible script that could  have fallen from Satan's very backside:
DIALOGUE TAKEN FROM HARD BOILED  -""It's a paper Crane.  I make one every time I kill somebody.  What do  you think, should I make you one?"" -""No Thanks."" - etc  etc.
What his Movies lack in script-polish and the like, they more than  make up for in the dream-like directing, and astoundingly intense  cinematography.
The Killer's bizarre, and often surreal action sequences,  will leave you begging for more of the same, yet, if you're new to Woo's  wonderous blend of traditional storyline coupled with truly jaw-dropping  action sequences, you may doubt his credentials somewhat.  From the opening  scene in the Yun Fat's hideaway Church, to the terrible Mickey Mouse gags,  right through to the bizarre combination of Japanese love songs playing  along to some rather gruesome gunfights; The Killer is a must-own.  It's a  fine example of Woo's work prior to Hard Boiled, which is a good thing,  because...
Hard Boiled is simply the Action fans' Action movie.  It  doesn't get any better than this.  From the moment the opening credits  begin, you know the guy holding the Tequila (being ""slammed"" in  close-up)is hard as nails. The action simply doesn't stop.  Ever. And it's  the kind of action that keeps you rooted to your seat.  When Yun Fat's  character, Tequila, isn't busy being involved in spectacular shoot-outs,  he's either back at HQ arguing with the Super in true 'loose-cannon cop'  fashion, or he's pistol-whipping Triad bosses. The finale itself clocks in  at almost an hour in length!
If you've seen Van Damme in Hard Target, and  Travolta & Cage in Face-Off, you still haven't seen and understood  exactly why he is the proclaimed god of action the industry says he is.  Simply put, Hard Target and Face-Off are Hollywood-diluted and simply pale  when sat aside The Killer and Hard Boiled. This is Woo at his finest.",968716800,5,2242,4.89572192513369
778165,5,6304074743,"These WOO classics stunningly mix violence and cinematic excellence into an end result that'll blow you away. Their BPM levels are the highest ever, and they each played an integral role in bringing Director John Woo into the mainstream. These are two of the films that made him!
Having only been available on DVD for a short time in the early days of the format, these new productions are dual language (Cantonese and English) and feature brand new commentary by Mr. Woo.
IF you are an action fan, this is a great two film set that will leave you wondering why most action films are really so boring.

7861332,5,6304074743,John Woo and Chow Yun-fat are incredible in these two masterpieces of HK Chinese action movies. Unequalled action scenes in a non-stop sequence of breathtaking scenes. Makes Western remakes seem slow and stodgy in comparison. Great storylines and acting throughout (with a good dose of humour as Woo takes on small roles with gusto!).

7861334,5,6304074743,"""Give a man a gun and he is a hero. Give him two and he is God""

Nothing can quite prepare you for the amount of bullets that are used in this film - all done to an impeccable action style that has still not been beat. If there was ever a Guinness Book of Records for the ""Most bullets shot in a film"" John Woo's Hard Boiled would be first place for a very long time. It is a terrible shame that this director has only been toned-down by Hollywood. There is not a hope that he would be allowed to do what he has done here with Hong Kong actors to the Hollywood cream of the crop. It seems that it is okay to have a Hong Kong Asian to shoot the hell out of everything but this same action when applied to Western culture would only shock and shame. The same can be said for the star of Hard Boiled - Chow Yun-Fat (Crouch Tiger, Hidden Dragon) who since moving to the West has fired less bullets in all his Hollywood films put together than he does in the first five minutes of this film. Does that really matter? In many ways - Yes it does. Unlike THEIR Hollywood films the gun violence here is not gratuitous. It is artistic and warrented. No one can come away from this film to say that have seen unjustified and unnecessary amounts of actions. It is all integral to the style and plot of this movie. Yes, innocent people do get mowed down in a hail of hot lead and yes the violence is bloody, but is that not what gun violence is? Here you see exactly what guns do to people. Forget Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" - The true message of gun control is right here! The plot is even about the dangers of gun smuggling!

One thing for sure is that there is more gratuitous gun violence in most Hollywood productions than there is here. Here we have a hard boiled cop who is assigned to tracking down gun smugglers. He is a hard boiled cop because he knows how to use his guns. His superiors are using him to fight fire with fire. The action gets going from the word go as the hard boiled cop busts a gun dealing operation. His buddy cops and innocent people get killed in the process. He then goes to extract some revenge and put the big gun runners out of business - only problem is there are literally thousands of them he must cut down. Cue unrelenting battle sequences from start to finish all done in excellent style and slow-mo. You have not seen anything like Hard Boiled before, nor will you again. The ending in the hospital is like DIE HARD with ten thousand times more suspense.

Hard Boiled is also a wonderfully acted movie with excellent first rate action direction. The story is also coherent and good, especially for an Asian production. This is every action fans wet dream. Believe me if you have not seen Hard Boiled then it is about time that you did.

Majestic Filmmaking, not to mention John Woo's greatest film. This is the stuff of Legend with an action hero to root for.",1103328000,7,2901,4.259528130671506

7861336,5,6304074743,"I don't understand the other reviewer.  The Killer is, with Die Hard, the best and most influential action movie of the 1980s, period.  Sure, the budget is visibly tighter, but there's more energy and drama in here than just about any action flick ever made!
Hard-Boiled was made later and is essentially just a setup for a one-hour-long shootout -- which is great!  It has some of the best-designed (and bloodiest) action scenes ever made, but it's not perfect.

7861338,5,6304074743,"If there is one thing that can be said about this double set of John Woo is that it represents the two faces of his story telling: action/drama(The Killer) and all-out-action(Hard-Boiled). Both are exceptional pieces of work and should be checked out by any fan of action movies, which just makes this an even better buy.
Both display the man's crafts hard at work. The Killer works more around building stronger character relationships where as Hard Boiled is just go-for-broke-shoot-many-people-as-possible cinema(phew!). Both work effectively(esspecially in the action department) because of John Woo's directing and cinematagraphy. He minipulates the camera durring the action to stunningly create involving action. Where as most action movies use just cut-away shoot outs, The Killer and Hard Boiled feature frantically moving cameras to keep the action, well, action. His use of symbolism within the movies help add another layer of depth to keep it from just another superficial affair(though its still not exactly thought provoking). Simply put, The Killer and Hard Boiled show a man at the top of his game. My only complaint is the fact that Mission Impossible 2(yuck)is his reference movie. Other than that, this is a must for any fan of the Woo, film noir, action, or just movies in general.",1014508800,2,1302,5.23444976076555
7861339,5,6304074743,"When the Beastie Boys claim that they've ""got more action than my man John Woo"", they're making quite a claim. These two videos are classic Woo, before he came to Hollywood. Put that disastrous MI:2 out of your head. This is the real stuff. In any one action scene in either of these movies, more bullets are fired than in any other action movie's duration. This is balletic violence at its best. It's where Chow Yun Fat (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - Li Mu Bai) first got his recognition. Not only are the action scenes incredible, but the story and characterization are good, too. The only painful thing (other than that suffered by the actors) is the voice dubbing. If a subtitled version is offered, get that. It's not like you're going to be able to take your eyes off the screen.",1001289600,,788,4.556338028169014
7861340,5,6304074743,"If you like action you need to own these. quite simply these are the two greatest action films ever made. nothing arnold made can ever compare to these. Chow Yun-Fat makes arnold, stallone, van dame etc. look like a bunch of little girls. He is truly one of the 5 coolest actors alive today. the others being Nic Cage, Travola, Bruce Willis. These two movies are amazing. THe Killer is the story of a man trying to escape from his life while his new boss trys to kill him. he befriends a police officer and the two become close. Great cinematogrophy here. Woo puts up lots of beautifull and haunting images. especially slow motion death scenes. Great shootouts. Yun Fat is the coolest hitman ever. Danny Lee does well as his cop friend. The Mexican stand-off was perfected in this film, though no shots were actually fired. The final gun battle in the church is over the top, outrageous and amazing. truly brilliant. plus you get to see a statue of the virgin mary get blown up!! how cool is that. Btw the hitman in the killer does speak at one point but stays silent the rest. if you want a silent killer watch "" A better Tomorrow 2"". The ending is truly satisfying and quiet suprising. Hardboiled is the better movie though. GREATEST ACTION FILM EVER. could rival Saving Private Ryan in body count. considering spr was a war movie thats pretty amazing. Chow yun fat gives his second coolest peformance, his first coolest being in A Better TOmoorow 2. Leung almost steals the show as the under cover cop. THe plot is that Chows partner gets killed in a shootout so Chow vows to bring down Johnny Wong, the gun dealer. So basically its chow vs. hundreds of gangsters. hardly seems fair....for the gangsters that is. this movie has the greatest action scenes ever. the opener is stunning. stair cases. birds. toothpic. awesome. Many other cool sequences leading up to final gun battle in hospital. Greatest shootout ever filmed. 30 minutes of sheer action. beats out the conclusion to saving private ryan. totally intense action. truly amazing movie. if you like action you have to own these two.",989020800,,2095,4.664864864864865

The Killer has a better story but Hardboiled is a much better film overall. Both are 5 star films. The Killer has great gritty action that takes place on a beach, apartment, night club etc. The Church scene is one of the top 5 shootouts ever filmed. it will blow u away, in addition to about 50 bad guys. The ending is one of the most un-hollywood ever filmed and will bring tough guys to the verge of tears. Great movie that will prepare u for Hardboiled. Hardboiled is WOo's apex. Chow and Lung are amazing and cool. This is woos highpoint. This movie has action in such quantity that i never though possble. shootouts in tea houses, wharhouses, boats etc. THe hospital fineale is THE GREATEST SHOOTOUT EVER.
