7882708,3,6305086850,"I am a big fan of Abbott and Costello, but this title is not one of their best films.  Later this summer the superior ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN is slated for DVD release, and I hope it is a better  reproduction.  What is the point of releasing these old titles on DVD if  there are no extras?  MCA/Universal is very bad at this.  At least the old  box set laser discs of A&C films had the trailers included.  A complete  filmography would be nice.  Another reviewer mentioned this release was  supposed to be in widescreen, but that is doubtful because it was not a  widescreen film when it was released in theatres almost 50 years ago.  MCA/Universal, though, is notorious for being cavalier with their video  releases and making mistakes.  Read the liner notes put out by the studio  for this title, and you'll see that they misdescribe events and get  character names wrong.  They also identify a fish as a crab!  Abbott and  Costello may have been low budget but their pertformances and routines were  quality.  Their films made a lot of money for the studio when the studio  needed it, and I would expect the studio to have greater respect for the  boys.",962236800,5,1171,4.572815533980583
