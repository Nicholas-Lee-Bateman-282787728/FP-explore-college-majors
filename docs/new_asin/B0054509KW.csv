8456221,1,B0054509KW,"Di Di Hollywood(2011) is a tacky soap opera!  It's about a barmaid from Spain who wants to be a movie star in Hollywood. She's willing to do unpleasant things. I laughed my butt off when the Maria character got run over by a car! ""My Maria...got crushed by a car...""  The female lead has no charisma! What is Peter Coyote doing in this movie? This is an R rated film. There is nudity in it. This dumb, vapid movie is a waste of time!",1521331200,,433,4.142857142857143

8456227,2,B0054509KW,"In the beginning, the film was boring, annoying and unbelievable, then it just dragged on and on.  There could have been a story there, but not here.  None of the characters were developed and were all very one-dimensional.  The acting was poor as well.  What a disappointment!",1370995200,,277,4.829787234042553
