4531690,1,B0052W9U0C,"If you have bought ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You? The Complete 1st and 2nd Season"" and the ""Best of The New Scooby-Doo Movies"" or ""Scooby-Doo and the Harlem Globetrotters"" don't be a sucker and buy this cause they got a new cover. This is WB way of trying to get more money off people cause they hope no one will think about looking at the back or paying too close attention to what's on the back. The episodes on this come from one of the 2 series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. ""Hassle in the Castle"" and ""Go Away Ghost Ship"" come from ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You"" and ""The Ghostly Creep from the Deep"" is from ""Best of The Scooby-Doo Movies"" and ""Scooby-Doo and the Harlem Globetrotters"". So if you got any of these DVD sets I first mentioned don't buy this and if you don't buy the season stuff instead of wasting your money on volumes or this 3 episode thing, especially if you're a Scooby fan. Happy shopping.",1314489600,57,916,4.3313953488372094

4531718,1,B0052W9U0C,"I fell prey to this DVD in the store, when my young son saw it and said ""YO HO"" I simply looked at the cover and OK'd it (never again). The cover makes it look like a movie, but it's just 3 episodes. Episodes that are on other Scooby Doo DVD sets (That we already own) at that. Also, it should have been titled ""Ghosts"" and not ""Pirates"", All 3 of the episode are about Ghosts, and the first episode doesn't even take place on sea or boat, let alone have pirates in it. I am very displeased with this deliberately misleading, lack of pirate Scooby Doo ""video"".",1338336000,3,560,4.194444444444445
8454554,3,B0052W9U0C,"Scooby Doo and the gang from the Mystery Van are in three 29 minutes episodes entitled ""Hassle in the Castle;"" ""Go Away Ghost Ship;"" and ""The Ghostly Creep from the Deep"" with their special guests, the Harlem Globetrotters. Scooby Doo and the gang are back to solve mysteries and get a Scooby snack.

You won't get any special features here. These are the original episodes from the series in the late sixties. Still, they're enjoyable for kids and adults alike if you want a great escape.",1516147200,,489,4.686046511627907
