8273463,5,B0019D1YCA,"For me, as someone who has attempted MX racing and been an enthusiast since seeing the Europeans appear at Pepperell Massachusetts in 1969, Bob Hannah demonstrates the true level of character that was necessary for him to reach the pinnacle of success in the sport.  As he mentions in an interview, he would have been a fighter pilot if he'd been born in a different time.  He is a great example of the level of personal vision, self importance, and self creation needed for a person of his background and time to become so dominant as a racer and as a fan favorite.  He was a ""flying ace"" in every sense of the term!",1373328000,,617,4.394736842105263

8273465,5,B0019D1YCA,"If you like motocross, you'll like this series from the Speed Channel.  I particularly liked the Bob Hannah installment.  I've been trying to get a copy of it since before they made them available on dvd.  Hannah is one of the more colorful riders of that era......to quote one of his competitors in the film, ""Bob made arrogance cool!""",1282608000,,336,4.661016949152542

8273467,5,B0019D1YCA,"I am 43 and have loved motocross since i was a kid, so obviously Hannah is one of my favorites. I still have an XR400.  I loved the dvd. They did a great job with the history and interviews and footage, and it is several hours long.  It is pricey but well worth it and highly recommended!!",1235001600,3,289,4.052631578947368
