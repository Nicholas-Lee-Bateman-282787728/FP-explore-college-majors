3984994,5,B002TMI2A2,"Greetings,

Let me clarify some cool details which make this DVD a unique, one-of-a-kind, must-have:

- The ""base version"" of the Transformers 2 movie was released in 2.4:1 screen format.  What this means is that similar to most recent ""blockbuster"" movies, the image retains large black bars on the top and bottom of the screen, even on widescreen HDTVs, which have a top-to-side screen ratio of 16:9 (or 1.78:1 if you reduce the fraction).  These movies aren't designed to fill the screen on a regular HDTV (kind of annoying).

- This ""Big Screen Edition"" of Transformers 2 tries something only done once before on either DVD or Blu-Ray releases (Dark Knight) - about 10 minutes of the movie was actually shot using super-resolution IMAX film stock, so those original images are captured on 1.33:1 (i.e. 4:3, the old almost-square TV top-to-side ratio), then cropped to only use a portion of that for the original release.  For major scenes in this DVD, however, a larger portion of the IMAX film was used, enough to completely fill a 1.78:1 HDTV widescreen.  These ""Big Screen"" images are larger, show more information (from the IMAX film stock) and are superior resolution in any format. So if you're watching on a standard HDTV screen, the black bars vanish and the entire HDTV screen is used, with even more detail than you would see in the regular 2.4:1 image.

The end result is SPECTACULAR. The images are bigger, sharper, more vivid, and completely fill up your HDTV screen, without black bars.  My only wish is that they would have included MORE of these IMAX scenes, not only the major fight scenes. Still, there are simply no other movies like this today (Dark Knight had quality problems) - it's a GEM, a showcase for your home theater, and a substantially improved experience when watching the movie.  Highly, highly recommended, and the quality improvement is noticeable on any DVD, in any Home Theater, regardless of the system.  And they're rare - trust me, you're friends don't have this, and will be wow'ed by it when you show them.  And while the Blu-Ray is better, this is still a killer feature on the regular DVD version (which I have).",1272585600,37,2160,4.808108108108108
3984995,2,B002TMI2A2,"Don't get me wrong I think the idea of Transformers is great and all, but Transformers themselves are not a story. Which I believe this movie seriously lacks, story. Although many events occur in this movie it is difficult to determine what is actually going on. What started out as a story from the beginning of the film turns into what seems to me as a wild goose chase for the boy, Sam Witwicky played by the ever famous Shia LaBeouf. This chase is the only thing connecting the events occurring and is not very compelling. The events feel as if they are just a bunch of elements the screen writers or Michael Bay himself wanted to include but just never really had much to do with the overall story. Michael Bay tries to give the fans what they believe they want to see in this film but in reality the film focuses too much on the robots, which you see everywhere, not in disguise. I would have liked the film better if it had teased me with the robots appearances like the first film did. I also would have enjoyed the story focusing around the humans more than the robots.

In the end I give this film two stars because I do not like this film but being a fan of the series I just could keep myself from buying this movie and keeping it as part of the lore.",1266364800,5,1263,4.240663900414938
3984996,5,B002TMI2A2,"Similar to the 'Dark Knight' blu-ray, this is the version shown at IMax theaters.  This is on both the dvd and blu-ray from Wal-Mart.  In addition, it has a slightly different cover, with Bumblebee instead of Megatron.

Keep in mind, that the whole movie is not ""big screen"", just the fight scene in the middle and end of the movie, the rest is standard 16:9.  It even boast's a few extra seconds of deleted scenes during these segment's as well.  I would recommend this version to people, especially if you got a really big screen tv, 55"" and bigger.  If you live in the states, pick this up at your local Wal-Mart, and if you got a blu-ray player, even better!!",1259884800,13,663,4.43801652892562

3984999,4,B002TMI2A2,"Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen

I never saw the first Transformers movie of 2007 and had little interest in seeing this one.  However, I cannot argue with $390 million in ticket sales in just five days.  Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen is on track to be one of the largest grossing movies of all time. I had to see it.
 I am pleasantly surprised with the movie and glad I did.
 This is a special effects monster, let there be no doubt about that.  The action is non stop.  The plot is thin but discernible, through all the mayhem and exploding stuff.  And what beautiful explosions there are.  The innumerable scenes of battling robots are less impressive.  I think it must be the Steven Spielberg touch that gives the good bots enough personality that we care, a little at least, what happens to them.  Spielberg and director Michael Bay both took executive producer credits.
 Bay had achieved his greatest box office bonanza in eight outings with this one.  All seven of his previous efforts, from Bad Boys to Pearl Harbor to Transformers have gained over $100 million box office dollars, world wide.  He knows how to make movies we want to see.
 Shia LeBeouf reprises his previous Transformer role and solidifies his position as a rising young action star.  Also back is 23 years young leading lady Megan Fox, todays movie it girl.  She is currently the most photogenic actress on the planet.  We wish her a long and successful movie career.
 Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen rates an explosive four saw blades.  The PG-13 film runs a satisfying 2 hours and 24 minutes.  This may well be the biggest movie of the year and should be seen on that basis alone.  One would like to be in touch with the taste of the public.
 Did I mention Megan Fox?  How aptly named she is.",1427068800,,1796,4.5754716981132075

8380281,1,B002TMI2A2,I was all excited to get this in the mail today for a Christmas present for my cousin and when I opened the box the movie was not wrapped in plastic and the bottom/top of the movie box was worn down a little. I took the cover box off and the seal was still in tact at the top so I peaked in the side and realized that neither one of the discs were in the box so I'm very pissed off and completely furious that I paid for an empty box.,1450396800,,434,3.7282608695652173
