8190149,5,630198577X,Still my all time favorite! Wish she had made more exercise videos and would be nice if was in a cd format.,1415059200,,107,3.909090909090909
8190150,5,630198577X,"I was so happy to find a copy of this tape. I purchased this as a replacement to my first one which was so worn I was afraid it was going to be unusable. I don't know what happened to Deborah Crocker, she isn't making exercise videos anymore.  Her stuff was the BEST.  I just LOVE her videos. This video is from the 80s/90s so it's definitely dated but it's still fun! It's still relevant. It's still effective. Buy this tape and any other from Deborah Crocker. You won't be sorry.",1391731200,,481,4.274725274725275
8190151,5,630198577X,"I was a fat kid and fat teenager, and I tried all sorts of diets and workout programs. It wasn't until I did the Deborah Crocker workout video that I lost weight. I lost 50 pounds, and I was never that big fat person ever again. Occasionally, I'd put some of the weight back on, but just about every time I did, I'd do this workout video (which I still remember, even without the video), and the weight would come off again. To this day it remains the best workout video I've ever done, and I've tried about a dozen others. She starts out with a warmup, gets you into low impact, then moves into just 5 or 6 minutes of high impact, then back down to low, and then a cool-down. I believe it's this perfect succession that takes off the most fat. I love you, Deborah Crocker!",1345766400,,773,4.194630872483222
