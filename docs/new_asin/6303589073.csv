683706,5,6303589073,"Based on a very smart screenplay directly written for the screen by Paul Schrader and Brian De Palma, OBSESSION is, in my opinion, the masterpiece of the director of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. The movie can be read at several different levels but is primarily an excellent thriller treating of the guiltiness felt by a man who failed to rescue his wife and his daughter when kidnapped in New orleans.
The key of OBSESSION lies in the scene of the first encounter between Courtland and Sandra, in the medieval church in which the hero married his first wife. Sandra is trying to restore old paintings that happen to have been themselves painted over older paintings. Asked by Courtland if the new paintings will be erased, Sandra answers that it's not useful to destroy them in order to bring into light the original ones.
So OBSESSION is clearly an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO but is also a movie of its own who deserves credit. I remember that the sumptuous travellings of De Palma's camera were, in the seventies, rather unusual in the american production and generated numerous critics. One can only observe, 25 years later, that De Palma new aesthetics has inspired a whole generation of american filmmakers, like Steven Spielberg for instance, who has understood that a camera movement could produce emotions in the viewer's heart.
Among the bonus features of this DVD, there is a very interesting featurette with recent interviews of the cast.

683708,4,6303589073,"Brian DePalma started his career by immitating Hitchcock's style. His love of all things Hitchchok are never more present than in Obsession. This film is not just done with a Hitchcock flair, it is more of an ode to Hictch and some of his most famous films. The second act is pure Vertigo, the third act is Rebecca, and the fourth goes out of it's way to use in the most famous scene from Dial M For Murder. This is not a simple homage, this is almost duplication. But that is not a bad thing. This is a great little film and DePalma obviously created it out of a labor of love for the Master of Suspense. If you are fan of Hitch or DePalm I highly recommend Obsession. However I urge you to watch Vertigo, Rebecca and Dial M For Murder before watching this film so you can understand what DePalma was up to when creating this movie.",1000944000,11,833,4.245283018867925
683709,4,6303589073,"De Palma is famous for directing many 'homages' to Hitchcock but lately i have tired of his 'homages' but when De Palma first started out he really did make good homages to Hitchcock instead of tired ones and this was a very worthy one indeed. It's about a successful business man (Cliff Robertson) who has everything: money, a beautiful and loving wife, good friends, and a daughter. But one night a group of kidnappers kidnapp his wife and child and in exchange for the safe return of his family they ask for money. He agrees but the police decide to try another method to try and catch the kidnappers which goes horribly wrong and the car in which the wife and child are supposed to be in crashes and explodes. For more than 15 years the man lives in constant mourning until he takes a business trip with his best friend and business partner (John Lithgow) to Italy. While he is there he visits the church where he and his wife were at once and there he sees a young italian woman (Genevieve Bujold) who looks exactly like his late wife. Soon after he starts to become obsessed with her and a relationship insues but soon after there follow many plot twists which i won't spoil. De Palma's direction is very Hitchcockian. It's very much like Hitchcock's direction in VERTIGO. He gives the film a surreal and haunting feeling by constantly having reminders of the dead family around and by using gothic settings. The writing is actually quite good. It has many twists and it develops the relationship between Cliff Robertson's character and Genevieve Bujold's character very well. It keeps a constant tension by making the audience wonder about this and that most of the time. The acting is quite good too, especially Miss Bujold who plays two roles. She is elegant and sophisticated in what little screen time she has as the wife and she has no dialogue in that part so she uses her face and eyes to convey the happiness and terror that her character feels. And as the young lady she is totally the opposite of her other character. She is more youthful and has a naive quality and an earnestness she does not show in her other character. Cliff Robertson plays his part well enough though he can't hold a candle to Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of his essentially similar character in VERTIGO but his performance stands on it's own. He chooses to mask his feelings instead of making them more apparent. You be the judge of whether that is a smart idea or not. All in all this is a worthy homage to the master (complete with a Bernard Herrmann score that sounds like the one in VERTIGO) and it never dissappoints. But i prefer to stick with the real thing.",998006400,4,2653,4.57563025210084
683710,5,6303589073,"Another excellent De Palma thriller, this time without the sex and violence.  Even if you don't like his other movies like BODY DOUBLE, if you want an interesting and atmospheric thriller, get this.  It is a much more subtle film some of ones that followed, partly a love story, partly a mystery and all class.  I won't explain the story as it has already been explained here and elsewhere a million times, so on to the DVD.
The picture is a bit grainy(some parts look better than others), but although I hadn't seen the film before I have read that it has always looked grainy and washed out ever since it was first released.  Still apart from the grain the picture is still sharp.  You get 5.1, 2 channel and mono english sound tracks and they sounded good to me.
Also included on the disc is an excellent 35 minute documentary and a trailer(plus trailers of two other films).",997228800,25,878,4.49685534591195
683711,5,6303589073,"I have an obsession with this movie. I've seen Obsession over a dozen times and I don't seem to tire of it.

Robertson plays wealthy real estate developer Michael Courtland whose wife(Genevieve Bujold) and daughter are kidnapped and killed in a police chase in the late 1950's. Years later, Courtland finds a woman identical to his late wife on a trip to Venice.

Shot in the most beautiful Vilmos Szigmond cinemascope possible (the 70's period is rather heavy on the diffusion by today's standards, but exquisite), I think it is a shame that the current DVD release is only standard, not anamorphic DVD. The frame compositions in anamorphic are GORGEOUS. The rich greens and musty colors of New Orleans envelope me in a bottomless, unfathomable plot. Honestly, if you can't see it in wide screen scope, you're missing a lot!

This film is utterly stunning in story and execution from first frame to last. Bujold, Robertson, and Lithgow are fantastic! This film launched John Lithgow's career. And the score by Bernard Herrman, powerful, edgy, and sweetly lingering, is my personal favorite.

""Herrmann's music, beautifully recorded in London, is among his last and his best as well. It would make blank film compelling."" -- Variety

""This is an immensely important cinematic work, with a throbbing, lusty score by Bernard Herrmann."" -- Rex Reed

""It's a magnificent, haunting score that, on first hearing, seems to rank with this composer's finest work."" -- Hollywood Reporter

Obsession is a great and passionately romantic film and not to be missed by anyone. This is one of the last -- and definitely the best -- films that Cliff Robertson made before he dropped off the map, much to my dismay. (thanks to a conflict with a Columbia executive.) The warmth and presence of his character play marvelously against the tragic backdrop of this timeless story. Robertson hits a bullseye with this role.

Hitchcock times ten. I love the period feels and the transitions from future to past. While the similarly themed ""Vertigo"" puts me to sleep with it's languid pacing and hypnotic score, ""Obsession"" seems vibrantly alive and compelling from first frame to last, with an extremely rich emotional pallette.

Brilliant! Far and away Brian De Palma's best film! (No hyperbole, this.)",993340800,8,2279,5.039893617021277
683712,4,6303589073,One of De Palma's best 70's efforts!,992736000,4,36,4.285714285714286
683713,5,6303589073,"Brian de Palma did a very good job with this movie. The story is similar to Hitchcock's Vertigo, a man who lost his wife, discovers one day a woman who looks like her. This is why we can consider Obsession like a brilliant hommage to Hitchcock. In fact, Brian de Palma borrows heavily from Vertigo and a little from Dial M for murder (whith the murder scene with the scissors).  Obsession should be watched after Vertigo in order to understand the links between the two movies. Thus, the music is composed by Bernard Herrmann and is very reminiscent of Vertigo's music. Herrmann thought that it was one of his best movie music and we can agree with him. Obsession is one of the best movies of Brian de Palma, it is an hommage of a master to another. Full of cinematography inventivity, suspense, good acting and characters, Obsession is a true obsession for viewers. Watch it and you won't regret it !",992217600,13,901,4.561728395061729
683714,5,6303589073,"Brian DePalma directed a string of truly inspired films in the 1970s, from SISTERS to CARRIE, from the campy, baroque glam of PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE, to the decade-ending double shots of DRESSED TO KILL  and BLOW OUT.  In the middle, he directed OBSESSION, which upped the ante of perversity, beauty and lurid unpleasantness of Hitchcock's VERTIGO (with a dash of DIAL 'M' for good measure).  What people dismiss as second-hand aping, I see as respectful homage, an updating of Hitchcock's perspective for the post-Vietnam, post-Beatles age.  He was, after all, one of the leaders of the ""film school brats"" of the late 1960s (all members of which blatantly copied the masters of the previous generation), and, to my mind, was the most brilliant (at least technically), the most mature, and the most sensitive of his peers.  Give me the twisted emotional and visual depths of OBSESSION over a malfunctioning mechanical shark or a juvenile ""creature cantina"" any day!",990662400,33,967,5.056603773584905
683770,5,6303589073,"In my mind, possibly the best idea for a plot ever brought to cinema. They don't write movies like this anymore. Inspired by Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (1959) except that all the elements (save for the motivations of the main character) are all but unrecognizable, so this is no mere ""remake"". If you've never seen this overlooked classic, or you're growing a bit tired of the relentless, cookie-cutter, superhero plots these days, prepare yourself for a mindbending experience...right down to literally the very last frame.

Cliff Robertson plays a New Orleans businessman in love who is about to marry (Genevieve Bujold). But, soon after, there is a tragic kidnapping - the new wife along with her young daughter. There is a ransom note. There are specific instructions on where, when and how the million-dollar ransom is to be delivered. Also the chilling warning not to contact the authorities. But, desperate, he makes contact with the FBI anyway. They manage to trace the kidnappers to their hideout, but things go wrong and there is a shootout - the kidnappers escape with his wife and his little girl...they are never seen or heard from again.

Fastforward a couple of decades later. He has remained a man with one foot in the present and the other in the past. His business in the intervening years has continued to prosper. He takes a trip to Europe, ostensibly to get his mind off his work...but can't help remembering his wife. He is drawn to the church in Italy where they had been married and while inside, sees a young woman who appears to be the spitting image of his dead wife. He makes conversation. They eventually begin to date...eventually there is an affair. There is another wedding. And...another kidnapping. And another ransom note. This time with the identical demand of the one years before...

Oddly enough, all this is Not a spoiler alert. It simply sets the stage ultimately for the mindbending resolution.

""Vertigo"" is a terrific and layered film in any context, but ""Obsession"" may even be better. A truly haunting score (well worth seeking out) is turned in by none other than Bernard Herrmann, the very same composer who so famously scored the majority of Hitchcock's films, including ""Vertigo"".

It will make no difference to your enjoyment of ""Obsession"" if you've never even seen ""Vertigo"" at all. Both are great and each will fully stand on its own. Waaayy recommended!!

Although I can't really have a full discourse on the ending **without** calling for a spoiler alert, I will say that I believe this film is indeed NOT flawed as so many may seem to think. Although there is an obvious factual conclusion to be made during the final scene, and although it may well be possible to ""see"" this conclusion coming before this scene has played out, this conclusion is NOT the point of the ending and therefore is not the point of the film. The point of it is not in the conclusion of facts. The meaning is centered around the two characters involved who are only able to overcome the extreme bias of the outrageous factual circumstances between them because, deep down, they know they so deeply **want to **...and in fact, they realize they **must** overcome if they are to reclaim their lives. It ultimately is a matter of love, acceptance and forgiveness. The powerful, emotional ending is a triumph for the characters, despite all odds. For those who've seen both films, compare that ending to the one for ""Vertigo""...a far different take on the same material...and That is DePalma's triumph. But, DePalma couldn't have 'spoiled his own surprise' so to speak by tipping his hand earlier in the film, and needed to let the last scene play out as it did - but the factual conclusion itself is rendered, on an emotional level, veritably inconsequential to the characters themselves...and to us. It is perhaps one thing to say that DePalma was necessarily taking a risk (of losing the audience's focus in the last scene), but I think that it's quite another to say that, because of it, the film itself was flawed...the way I see it, our expectations were being challenged, that's about all, really.

But, speaking for myself, the full measure of the meaning of the last scene has seemed to become clearer to me and has deepened over the years with repeated viewings. It seems to me this is the way in which DePalma envisioned the film - to be seen multiple times...not really because there are so many details to piece together...there aren't...but, rather to better allow ourselves the **time** (and this movie is indeed about taking the time...even more than in ""Vertigo"") to **fully connect with** (and even revisit) the depth to which these emotions and motivations could truly run...to empathize. A reflective state and something that DePalma knew could not be rushed and that it all perhaps might not be so evident to us on the the first go-round...as if he were ultimately counting on our ability to emotionally 'Gestalt' to both fill in, and flesh out, what is necessary to give the film its true weight. Rush the process, resist sinking into your feelings...and you may miss it. A subtle thing, yet it may make all the difference. But, once accomplished, our movie-going experience just may then become, just as with ""Vertigo"", our 'obsession' (no pun intended) with the film itself. I think this film ultimately succeeds on that level very well...once successfully given the **time** it is asking for...not so much the length of that time, as the full depth of it. Just my two cents.

I am a big fan of this era of De Palma. I love ""Sisters"", ""Carrie"", and ""Blow Out"". This movie was definitely not up to par with any of those titles.

""Obsession"" moves slower than molasses. Dragging it's audience through a 98-minute ""Vertigo"" homage without the beauty, suspense, or allure of the Hitchcock film. Even Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack seems to be saying, ""Hey, we did this story already for Hitch, and I just don't have as much energy this time.""

The lack of style. The paper-thin predictable plot. Cliff Robertson's stone-faced reactions to everything. John Lithgow's bad fake mustache that changes from grey to blonde in the middle of any given scene. There's a lot to roll your eyes at here, and unlike De Palma's ""Body Double"", the cheese in this movie doesn't even make it fun.",1454544000,,820,4.801418439716312
683774,4,6303589073,"Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is one of my favorite films, and while it's a very influential piece of cinema (and Sight & Sounds choice of the all-time greatest film), it arguably has inspired no director more than Brian De Palma. He's well known for his admiration and emulation of Hitchcock, and many of his films (like Dressed to Kill and my personal favorite, Blow Out) have a clear Hitchcockian influence; at his best, De Palma knows how to copy Hitchcock better than almost anyone else. At his worst, though, De Palma can rely a little too heavily on style over substance (the constant use of split-screens in his films sometimes feels gimmicky to me), and while he gets Hitchcock, his stylistic choices make this film feel very showy and ostentatious at times. De Palma has Hitchcocks grasp of emotional and psychological obsession, but he lacks the ability to hypnotize like The Master of Suspense could. In a way, Obsession plays like a second-rate cover version of a great song: it gets all of the words right, but not all of the music.

As a fan of Vertigo, I was intrigued by the film; De Palma is a flawed but rarely boring artist, and this film is heavily influenced by Hitchcock in general, and Vertigo in particular. Paul Schrader, most famous for writing Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, penned the script. (Fun fact: Taxi Driver, which also came out the same year, was similarly influenced by John Ford's often overlooked masterpiece The Searchers, and both Obsession and Taxi Driver were scored by Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock's usual conductor.)

Early in Obsession, real estate agent Michael Courtland (Cliff Robertson) experiences a tragedy: his wife and daughter are captured and murdered. Fifteen years later, he meets a young woman who reminds him of his late wife. He beings to pursue her, and his real estate buddy Robert LaSalle (played by John Lithgow, a usually great actor with an unfortunately terrible accent here) convinces LaSalle to join him on a business trip in Florence. Cortland revisits the church where he met his wife and meets Sandra, the spitting image of his late wife. Spoiler alert: things may not be as they seem.

This film is strong and entertaining, but also a little disjointed. Paul Schrader's original script was called Dj Vu, and it was much longer than the finished film, with an entire other act. De Palma trimmed and rewrote the script, which enraged Schrader, who felt that he butchered his script. I have no idea if De Palmas changes were in service of a better film or not, but as released, Obsession is a good but flawed retelling of a masterpiece.",1449964800,,2605,4.849438202247191

Time passes and a severely emotionally damaged Courtland goes to Italy where he first met his late wife and runs into Sondra, a young Italian woman who is a dead ringer for her. Courtland thinks it's a miracle but everyone around him thinks it's a mistake; the girl is too young and the resemblance to his dead wife makes the whole thing unhealthy. Courtland doesn't want to hear it and let's his friends know they can either cheer for him at his wedding or get out of his life. But as the movie makes clear something IS wrong here. When Sondra secretly visits the cemetery where the late Mrs. Courtland and her daughter are buried you begin to wonder if this is a mystery/thriller or a ghost story. Is Sondra really Elizabeth Courtland come back to life? Poor half crazy Michael Courtland certainly thinks so but he's happy for the first time since the kidnappings and when he wakes up on what is supposed to be his wedding day and finds that someone has kidnapped Sondra he loses it. Crazy Mike Courtland was one thing but crazy and angry Mike Courtland is something to see. By the time the film comes to an end and we find out who Sondra really is while the Obsession waltz sweeps around her and Courtland the viewer has been on a roller coaster.

683945,5,6303589073,"The movie is brilliant. It's still a shame that we do not have Paul Schrader's completed script on film, but De Palma is a far more interesting director in hidnsight than his critical reception suggested during his heyday. The picture is nice, and there is a nice documentary feature (though Schrader is snubbed quite a bit in it as well), and the overall package, cover art, and content is pristine. Finally, a service that will due justice to powerful exploitation and cult cinema titles.
However, I have a major caveat: this disc will not play in standard players. I have a portable DVD player and that is the only device this disc will play on. Forget your BluRay player--the disc is not formatted to playback its encoded information. Also, on my copy alone (am I right?), the film skips and freezes in certain places, and I also noticed some subtitles cropping up at incorrect points during the film's duration--even though I did not have the subtitles turned ""on."" However, I am grateful to have this rare title under any condition, as most of the film did play fine, but it's still upsetting for such a classic film as this. Maybe my disc just needs cleaning, but I don't know. Anyway, what really upsets me is that ""Obsession"" has not been given a proper (read: major studio) DVD/BluRay combo pack release, with even more (and better) extras. Could they get the mortally wounded Schrader to do a commentary track explaining his disappointment in the production? And couldn't De Palma record one? I appreciate this cult series, but I thought another major studio would have remastered and rereleased this title by now--even Shout! Factory could do it justice, as they did the ""Walking Tall"" trilogy. But to have this title on such an obscure format...as I said, I'm grateful for it, but I don't think this title has been given the respect that it deserves, considering how many violent, video-game inspired crap-fests that we are constantly being subjected to on the modern movie market these days. The accompanying booklet is okay, but the critical essay really isn't all that insightful. Please, someone, rerelease this title and do it justice--for all!!!",1384992000,,2164,4.883152173913044

Bernard Herrmann's score and the 5.1 soundtrack are likewise just as dynamic and clean as if the film had been shot today.

But they don't shoot pictures like this today. This was made in a time when the director moved the camera in ways to tell the story (film noir). DePalma wasn't so concerned with dazzling us with CGI as they do today but dazzling us with cinematic style, which, at least then was an art form. The score and the directing were just as much characters in this film as the actors themselves. Don't get me wrong. This film is anything but pretentious.

The plot is similar to Vertigo, a man loses the love of his life and several years later finds her reborn in another woman. Cliff Robertson's lifeless performance doesn't help either. On the other hand the female lead and John Lithgow are both good. The music by bernard Herrmann is great and De Palma's visuals are among his best.

My approach to experiencing a movie was to suspend much of the disbelief and rational analysis that was integral to my life as an engineering graduate student.  Instead, I tried to immerse myself in the fictitious world created by the director and actors and experience it as if I inhabited one of the characters.  I was easily able to undergo this transformation while viewing Obsession, in part because Cliff Robertson was such a good actor and one of my perennial favorites.  Indeed, I experienced the film imagining myself as Cliff Robertson's character, a man plagued by guilt and longing as he continually relived the tragic loss of his cherished wife (played by the incandescent Genevieve Bujold) and daughter.

My acceptance of all of the plot elements in this film did not seem sensible to to my friend, who viewed his approach to film viewing as more of a critical exercise.  This movie worked for me though, and maybe it will work for you too!",1359763200,4,1164,4.594202898550725

DiPalma has suffered the slings and arrows of  critics and sketch comedians for his Hitchcock obsession; Obsession is sometimes put-down as little more than a spin on Vertigo.  Look again!  DiPalma's  mastery of the medium is evident in every sequence.

684077,4,6303589073,"Some great Blu-Ray discs have been premiering overseas, and many of them don't require region-free players to enjoy, either. At the top of the recent list is Arrow Video's tremendous Blu-Ray package of Brian DePalma's 1976 ""Vertigo"" homage OBSESSION.

""Obsession"" stars Cliff Robertson as a New Orleans real estate developer whose wife and daughter are killed in a kidnapping plot; decades later, he runs into Genevieve Bujold in Paris, who's the splitting image of his late wife. Is he going mad? Seeing double? Or is there a conspiracy plot at the center of DePalma and Paul Schrader's screenplay?

Despite its obvious, and intentional, similarities to ""Vertigo,"" ""Obsession"" isn't a great movie, with a somewhat icky story by Schrader and DePalma making for one of those films they could've only made in the `70s (and still netted a PG rating, no less!). Though Bujold is appealing, and John Lithgow serves up sufficiently slimy ""good o'l boy"" charm, Robertson's character often registers blankly at the events going on around him - he's certainly no Jimmy Stewart-everyman, at least - and the film's outcome strains credibility.

That said, there's still much to savor in DePalma's low-budget film, which was independently produced and later picked up by Columbia Pictures (who insisted that filters be used to suggest the movie's love sequence was a dream - and with good reason given the film's ending). Bernard Hermann's score is simply breathtaking - a flowing, mysterious, gorgeous work that ranks with his best - and Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is likewise memorable, utilizing the full Panavision frame as so many of DePalma's early works do. As a result of their efforts, the picture feels like a much more polished, elaborate production than it really was.

Arrow's UK Blu-Ray offering of ""Obsession"" is region-free and comes highly recommended for any fan of the film. Though the disc defaults to its original mono track upon playback, you'll want to access the full-bodied, remixed 5.1 DTS Master Audio soundtrack that spectacularly reproduces Herrmann's brilliant score. The 1080p transfer boasts a natural (DNR-free) image, though with so much of the film's cinematography being soft and/or filtered, there's little surprise that the print still looks a bit dirty at times. Supplements, meanwhile, include Laurent Bouzereau's documentary produced for Sony's old DVD release (which include some moving anecdotes about Herrmann's work on the film), the trailer, and a pair of early DePalma shorts, ""Woton's Wake"" and ""The Responsive Eye."" A reversible cover sleeve, meanwhile, houses international artwork for the film, while an extensive booklet features Schrader's entire first draft screenplay (under the original title ""Deja Vu"") with commentary from critic Brad Stevens that seems to completely misinterpret the meaning of the film's ending.",1337817600,3,2866,5.3763919821826285

Schrader wrote a script that had three parallel stories running simultaneously; one set in the past, one set in the present and one set in the future. Forced to trim the film, De Palma cut the future sequence at the suggestions of composer Bernard Herrmann and retitled ""Deja Vu"" to ""Obsession"".

A clever, well constructed romantic thriller ""Obsession"" remains one of De Palma's most fascinating films and while some of the plot twists and themes were borrowed from ""Vertigo"", De Palma takes them a step further here.

Recently released in the UK on a no region Blu-ray the film looks much improved by comparison although this is never going to be a demo quality Blu-ray; De Palma and Vilmos Zsigmond chose to shoot the film in soft focus with lots of difusion filters as part of the lighting scheme. As a result while the film does, indeed, look lovely, it's not going to feature the strong deteail that you might seen with a more contemporary film. De Palma and Zsigmond were going for creating a layered textured look and they largely succed with the film. ""Obsession"" has received a nice restoration at the hands of Arrow Films (or, perhaps, it's Sony who did the work for them--I'm not quite sure). Either way, the film looks exceptionally good for its age.

Arrow films has done a terrific job with the film using a high bit rate transfer on a dual layered disc to try and capture as much of the natural look of the film as possible; ""Obsession"" has always been somewhat grainy to begin with and Arrow films stays true to the original look of the film.

The audio sounds quite nice with a new 5.1 mix

The special features are quite nice as well. We get a 35 minute documentary on the making of the film featuring De Palma, Zsigmond, Cliff Robertson, Geneviene Bujold and editor Paul Hirsch discussing the making of the film. Paul Hirsch relates a story about a very frail Bernard Herrmann weeping after seeing a screening of the finished film. He was weeping because he couldn't recall writing the main theme for the film although he recognized it as his own. MIA is writer Paul Schrader presumely because he is still unhappy about the changes that De Palma made to his screenplay by dropping the last third of the story set in the future. De Palma was wise in cutting the last section of the original script because it would have stretched the credability of the story even further.

We also get the original trailer and two De Palma shorts from De Palma's personal collection--""Woton's Wake"" made in 1962 and the documentary short ""The Responsive Eye"" from 1966. Both are fascinating glimpses into De Palma's early technique.

We also get a replica of Paul Schrader's original script (which differs from the finished shooting script)AND a critical essay on the film itself. It is housed ina slip case with the Blu-ray and there are replicas of the original posters as well as a new (ugly)commissioned fold out poster included as well.

684113,5,6303589073,"Have you noticed the amount of so-called thrillers over the past 15 years that critics have hailed as a Hitchcock style thriller (like ""Panic Room"", ""Memento"", and the most recent ""Vacancy"" and ""Disturbia""), and they don't resemble anything Hitch anymore than Woody Allen resembles Kubrick? And, to make it worse, critics are throwing roses at these generic films, while heaving meat cleavers at Brian De Palma for his classy style. He dares to make genuine cinema art, relying a lot on the great technique of visual storytelling, with long scenes without any dialogue, making the viewer have to read movements of the characters (facial expressions, body language) as well as the camera.

And, for the whole Hitchcock connection, yes, his films do resemble Hitch's films a bit, but if you notice, they are MILES apart in tone, style, character, mood, and technique. They happened to share a lot of the same fetishes, and the same type of story lines. De Palma's films can be violent at times, but a lot of it is implied, not shoved right in your face. His films have deep emotional feel, but not so syrupy you want to break out some pancakes.

A lot of people dislike De Palma because once they've seen his films, then go back for a second viewing, they realize just how well he fooled them, the whole time displaying any clues possible right before their very eyes; hence, making them feel stupid. That is one of the qualities I love about his films. For once you've seen it, then go back and view it again with the knowledge you have of the overall film, letting all of the hints and OBVIOUS clues that are placed right before your very eyes the entire time; yet, when the movie was over, you felt like a rug just got pulled right out from beneath you.

And a LOT of people point out the ""Hitchcock"" touch his films seem to have, which they do...to a degree. What a lot of people don't seem to realize is that De Palma was also a student of the French Cinema Nuvue, artists like Godard, Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, and Lelouch. Yes, this film is admittedly (by De Palma - he said that he and friend, writer Paul Schrader had just seen ""Vertigo"" and loved the idea so much that it inspired this screenplay) inspired by Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", if anyone out there has ever seen Claude Lelouch's French 1966 masterpiece ""A Man And A Woman"" they will know what I'm talking about in reference to all of the OTHER great artists of film that inspired De Palma's style, decision, precision, and delivery.

Not to give any kind of spoiler, but the climatic ending that swirls into a freeze frame is straight from the ending of Lelouch's brilliant film ""A Man And A Woman"", and SO appropriately so, seeing that this film has such a romantic tone throughout it, even during the most suspenseful of scenes, the style of filming it is so romantic (I don't mean a love story, but in tone). Opening the film in 1959 New Orleans, so beautifully recreated even though the budget wasn't too great for this film at that time; but, you couldn't tell that by looking at it. It is such a timeless masterpiece of cinema that definetly stands the test of time, looking even better now than ever.

Cliff Robertson is awesome in his role as Michael Courtland. His facial expressions are dynamic in revealing his emotions during some breathtaking long scenes of visual story telling, without dialogue. And John Lithgow is great as Court's business partner/friend, ""Uncle Bob"" (homage to Uncle Charlie in Hitchcock's ""Shadow Of A Doubt""?). But my hat's off to Genevieve Bujold for her brilliant performance, not just as one, not two, but three different characters (something common in De Palma's films, having one actor playing multiple roles or personalities or characters) in what I consider to be a tour-de-force for her. (She later did great work in Michael Chricton's ""Coma"" and David Cronenberg's ""Dead Ringers"".) The fact that this was overshadowed by ""Carrie"" (another great De Palma classic that got released just a few months later the same year) is saddening. This film deserved to have a few nominations its way as well, especially for best actress. Again, not to be a ""spoiler"", but notice the range of expressions in her face during the climatic (or any) scene in the movie. Awesome.

The way the film is structured, it does homage a lot of Hitchcock, as well as some French directors, but this is the film that set De Palma on the map as for being considered the new Master Of Suspense (this was an excellent follow up to ""Sisters""). Or, better yet, for another, more updated version of ""Vertigo"", check out De Palma's 1984 classic ""Body Double"". ""Obsession"" is a much more ""cleaner"", more ""pure"" film than ""Body Double""; as a matter of fact, this is one the whole family can enjoy. Even with the revelation at the end, thank God that De Palma changed a crucial scene into a wonderful, hypnotic dream sequence because it would have being so tasteless once the mystery is solved, but sense the change was made, it cleans up the film in several ways. In the screenplay, the scene would have had two characters making love in a ""reality"" scene, and trust me, it's great the change was made. And, thank God that De Palma listened to composer Bernard Hermann about ending the film where he did! For those that don't know, the original screenplay was going to go even further into the future and the story. But, that was scrapped, and we now have (since 1976) a timeless masterpiece of cinema. A tale of love, obsession (before the word had a negative connotation to it), kidnapping, betrayal, murder, double identity, mistaken identity, character resemblance, double crossing, deja-vu, and mystery. In De Palma's world, everything is possible when sometimes nothing is impossible. Seeing is believing, but always look beneath the surfaces. Never take anything at face value, without knowing what's behind everyone's agenda.

And, if you want a great noirish story about any of the above done in a very stylish vision, then see ""Obsession"". If you don't trust my review, read all the other 4 or 5 star reviews on here, starting with Amazon's reviewer. They said a LOT of things that I would have said had it not being said already. They've all done a great job praising this film in their own words, and I highly recommend all of their reviews, for they are very insightful and intelligent reviews of a timeless cinematic masterpiece of suspense, romance, intrigue, and mystery.

684114,1,6303589073,"16 years after his wife and daughter were killed in a botched kidnapping, businessman Michael Courtland (Cliff Robertson) meets another woman, Sandy (Genevieve Bujold), who bears an uncanny resemblance to his dead wife.

Being a fan of many of Brian DePalma's other works, such as ""Carrie"" and ""The Untouchables"", I went into ""Obsession"" expecting to like it. However, what I found was a film that is slow moving and often boring. There is action at the beginning of the film and action at the end, but not much of anything during the hour or so in the middle, just Cliff Robertson and Genevieve Bujold getting to know each other. If you missed the first half hour of this film, you could be forgiven for thinking it a romance, rather than the thriller that it is meant to be. As the film progresses, the story becomes more and more unfocussed, and the ending is just plain ridiculous, as is the fact that the villain of the story waits 16 years to strike again - a killer attack snail could move faster than this guy.

""Obsession"" is Brian DePalma's ""homage"" to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"". However, whereas ""Vertigo"" is a great film that deserves its classic status, ""Obsession"" is a pale copy that only serves to highlight what a great film-maker Alfred Hitchcock truly was.",1217894400,4,1271,4.746606334841629
684115,3,6303589073,"Cliff Robertson's Obsession is for Genevieve Bujold's exact double of his kidnapped and murdered wife of twenty years earlier, but the title could just as easily stand for director Brian De Palma's over-fondness for Hitchcock and Paul Schrader's penchant for remaking The Searchers (complete with ""Will he kill her/Will he kiss her?"" ending). It's great fun as long as you haven't seen Vertigo - and when this was released in 1976, Hitchcock's masterpiece had been out of distribution for nearly two decades - but the similarities in both style and content become very apparent of you have. At one point they were even more pronounced with an unfilmed `fourth act' that saw Robertson descending further into further madness.

Nonetheless, the director's visual flourishes and audacious love of the purely cinematic in his camera movements, all the more sumptuous in this 2.35:1 widescreen DVD transfer, and Bernard Herrmann's brilliant penultimate score, with its magnificent final waltz theme, carry you along despite the air of familiarity. It also includes a featurette on the film and the original trailer.",1203206400,7,1110,5.306818181818182

  An excellent, haunting performance by Cliff Robertson. After his wife and daughter are kidnapped and ransomed, the police botch the rescue and the wife and daughter are apparently killed. Years later, Robertson broods over his loss and cannot recover from this. But,on a trip to Rome with his business partner, he ses a young woman working on paintings in a gallery who is a dead ringer for his wife. He becomes obssesed with her, dates her, and brings her back to the USA to marry her.  This does not go well with his business partner who feels he is ignoring his work.

Little does Robertson know that this is all part of a setup with the crime being repeated,and this girl and his business partner involved with the crooks. This young girl is really his daughter who was not killed in the kidnapping, but  hidden and sent back to Italy to live with relatives.

There is an exciting climax to the movie when Robertson discovers this ruse, and goes to the airport to kill the girl who turns around in flight and is coming back to the airport. One must see this movie for a great,climax to an intense movie.

I never see this movie being played on TV and in most places, this movie is out of print and is unavailable. Get this through Amazon.com while you can.",1200614400,2,1398,4.969957081545064
684117,4,6303589073,"Nothing is what it seems.
For those unfamiliar with this film I will not hint at the surprises within so that it remains unspoiled.
Everyone compares this to (or calls it a rehash of) ""Vertigo"". I enjoy both films. Both films, to me, are very sad. They are so much about loss, all kinds.

Brian De Palma's ""Obsession"" is a fascinating, stylish, classy, and very well made movie. It's a psychological romantic mystery. That's the best way I can categorize or describe it. It has excellent camera work, a rich and yet bombastic musical score (Bernard Hermann got an Oscar nomination for it), and good perfomances.

Some things about it are an acquired taste. The entire picture is filmed in a very dreamy way (filter or gauze, a real softness to the look which only adds to the atmosphere and feel). Some people will criticize the dvd quality, but this is the way the cinematographer and director intended it. You wouldn't want this in high definition. It's like a strange dream.

There are some plot points that leave me scratching my head. And after the film ends I am left with questions as to what fate awaits these characters (had the story continued), and I can only presume they are not happy ones in the slightest.

But I must say that this film has one of the most interesting, moving, and well-shot endings. It never, ever fails to get to me. It is not just the way it is shot and musically scored (though excellently), but the performances of the actors are just wonderful here.

And yet Vertigo's ending, on the other hand, is extremely abrupt and unsettling, an emotional slap in the face to the audience, compared to this one.",1200441600,5,1638,4.615120274914089

All I could remember were the scenes in the church, and I wanted to see a movie shot in Florence.  Well, the cinematography is very good, both Florence and New Orleans, but the rest of the movie is kind of a clunker, IMO.  The score, particularly, is WAY over the top.  I joked with my husband that next time we are in Florence I will hear that music in my head wherever we go (and not in a good way).  The plot is rather obvious by today's standards.  Finally, Cliff Robertson's acting was downright annoying at times.  He doesn't have a lot to say but stands around with weird eyes (and the music in the background enhances the point: OK, now Cliff is going through another weird moment).  Genevieve Bujold, on the other hand, was quite charming and did a good job of playing different ages.  It was also neat to see a much younger John Lithgow chew the scenery.

684185,4,6303589073,"OBSESSION is a great film, and even stands the test of time after 32 years!

I first saw this film in 1975 upon it's release.  It had an enormous impact on me, perhaps as I was a lot younger then, but it stayed with me for many years.  It was great to see it again after all this time, and it stands up very well indeed, unlike a lot of films from the 70's and 80's.

Its essentially a homage to Hitchcock, it has many similar structures, plot twists and very clever photography.  You may guess what's going on if you are a a seasoned movie viewer, but the journey is lots of fun, with some great characters and performances along the way.

Brian De Palma is a fascinating director, and this is a far better film than the later production and Kirk Douglas vehicle THE FURY, which, whilst it is suspenseful, its just not in the same league.  OBSESSION was De Palma's first widescreen production.

Filmed deliberately in soft focus to mask and assist the passage of 15 years (as explained in the excellent 2000 production documentary on the disc), the picture quality loses a little, even in the fully restored version on this release, but the wonderful score by Bernhard Herrmann is a real pleasure along with the terrific 5.1 Dolby mix.  In the doco it's great to see interviews with both Cliff Robertson and Genevieve Bujold, but John Lithgow is overlooked, or perhaps would not be involved.  A pity, as he has a pivotal role in the film and is a great Faustian character.

Some of the film is shot at the San Miniato church in Florence, it's a beautiful place, and well worth a visit.
