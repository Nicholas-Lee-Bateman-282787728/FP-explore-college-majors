7799021,5,1577420586,"Some time back in the mid 80's this made for TV movie aired. My father had recorded it for us as it was one of those ""specials"" that were really popular on Saturday afternoon, when all the normal cartoons were over. For many years after we would watch this movie until alas the tape was either broken or lost....

Flash forward: One day while mindless clicking on youtube links I ran across this little gem again. I immediately remembered how much I had loved this movie. Perhaps because at the time of its release I was just entering into that vague area between 9 and 12 when you are not really a child but you are not a teenager yet either. You are in this sort of limbo and this movie really struck a chord with me.

Now as an adult watching this made for TV cheesiness, there is a whole other realm of subtext that I missed. Perhaps it is just my cynical side seeing these things but I swear there are tons of drug references. There is weird, trippy music, rainbows, and an alternate universe.
Digging around on the web you can find that the movie was originally remake of Ofoeti from 1966. So some of the drug references sort-of make sense.  Setting aside the 80's and 60's cheesy factor it was well worth hunting down and digging out our long forgotten VCR.",1388448000,2,1264,4.370212765957447

This boy definitely loved trolls and all the joy they can

7799024,5,1577420586,"Let's not take this film too seriously, or judge it as if it was intended for adults.  It's based on a whimsical stage play for children, incorporating the various bridges and parks of Pittsburgh.  It's not ""low budget.""  It features Sam Waterston, William H. Macy (as a turtle), Susan Anton, Richard Schull, Max Wright (""Alf"") and James Karen.  It's a fairy tale set in modern-day Pittsburgh.",1181088000,,393,4.909090909090909
7799025,5,1577420586,"This film is a masterpiece. It captures the depth of the developmental psychology of Erik Erikson with its main character who is confronting the trials and tribulations of growing up and the stolid disillusionment which is impressed upon him by adult who have lost their imaginations. The movie plays wonderfully with the duality of childhood imagination and adult ratiocination, and thusly presents to us a coming of age drama,  while at the same time framing this with a comic sensibility. The dialogue between the overzealous bridge entrepreneur and the troll seeking kid is both frightening in an Orwellian sense and funny as it has the right touch of dark humor - which is maintained brilliantly throughout as the kid continues to be at odd's with the adults he encounters, all whom keep refusing to believe in the existence of trolls. Finally, the kid discovers an underworld where his imagination proves to be real, and the final hero is the boy himself, who endeavors to save the world of imagination from the destructive hyper-rationality of the grown-up world. This film is both thought provoking and at the same time accessible to children, who may not quite get the deeper motifs and symbolism, but will surely be motivated to ponder these very issues which will be presented in time as they reach the adult world. Overall, this short film is a master piece, and any one who doesn't think so I believe is not seeing beneath the surface, and perhaps is unfortunately too similar to the unimaginative, insipid adults which the film protrays as the antagonists to the powers of imagination and the creative mind.",1134086400,8,1621,4.937728937728938
7799026,1,1577420586,"A well-meaning family friend once rented this movie for my family and his, and we dutifully watched it. What followed was the singularly worst movie any of us had ever seen. ""The Boy Who Loved Trolls"" has now become a running family joke and provided us with hours of entertainment from mocking it. Yes, it's low-budget Wonder Works, but that never bothered me before. There are several Wonder Works productions that I adored. It's the plot and script that really take you on a wild ride to terrible. So painful there are not even words.",1108080000,3,537,4.663157894736842
7799027,4,1577420586,"The Good News: You can actually buy this video!
The Bad News: The poor video quality detracts greatly...
I love this video, it was one of my very favorite Wonder Works Productions. Too bad it doesn't look or sound any better than the copies I made off PBS on my own VCR...",999734400,8,272,4.25
