8627547,2,B00GU0YJL0,"Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie.  Family friendly, and great riding in beautiful places.  The only issue is, I would have loved to have read somewhere on the product info or on a product review that there was a $13.95 restocking fee upon return of an unopened DVD.  I bought the movie for a birthday gift, but didn't realize they already had it.  So, make sure you really want the movie if you order it.  I would have kept it if I knew there was such a hefty restocking fee. :(  VERY bummed.",1421971200,,498,4.189473684210526
