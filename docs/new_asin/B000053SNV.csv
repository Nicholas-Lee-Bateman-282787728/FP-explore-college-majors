7930179,1,B000053SNV,"I recently wrote what I thought was an honest and professional review of this movie which could not be watched since it became unusable after about 20 minutes of use.  Amazon.com thought my review was not appropriate and sent me a bunch of guidelines.  For one thing, I resent being told to amend something that I considered professional, not expletive ridden, and honest.  This movie was poor quality even for an old VHS tape.  The top of the picture was almost too faint to see.  The characters were not identifiable most of the time.  The dialogue was what I expected it to be.  The movie came in one package consisting of 2 VHS tapes, well packaged and received on time.  Before I had even watched one tape, I was disgusted with it but could not have finished it anyway since the tape became unraveled. I would like a return of my money.  The VHS is in the trash. It is too fouled up to repackage.  You wanted more of a review;  well you got it. Send my money and acknowledge a little satisfaction guaranteed.

7930180,4,B000053SNV,"""The Scarlet Horseman"" is a 13-chapter serial released by Universal Pictures in 1946, directed by Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins.

The Staked Plains region of western Texas, in 1875 believed wasteland by most people, is desired for its unsuspected riches and a haven from the Law by a group of conspirators, headed by ""Matosca"" whose identity is initially kept secret, operating out of the nearby town of Forty Four.  The Comanche Indians, who have lived there for many years, are led to believe that efforts to create a state out of the region are for their benefit.  Following the murder of their Chief, ordered by ""Matosca"" the Indians attack the settlers, armed with rifles supplied by the conspirators.  The Indians are guided by Loma (Victoria Horne), half-caste daughter of the old Chief, who hides her true identity by working as a servant for Carla Marquette (Virginia Christine), daughter of a deceased state senator.  Undercover agents Kirk Norris (Peter Cookson), Amigo Maana (Cy Kendall) and Jim Bannion (Paul Guilfoyle), assigned by the Texas Senate, are trying to quell the uprising and find that the Indians believe in a legendary leader known as The Scarlet Horseman, identified by the high-trumpet-like sound of a mysterious carved ""music bone"" which the agents manage to obtain.  Bannion has already been operating as a masked rider, posing as a wheelchair-bound gunsmith, so he wears the necessary hooded costume and becomes the figure of legend.  But the conspirators, in an attempt to get their measure passed, have kidnapped the wives and daughters of several State Senators.

Universal should be given credit for trying to improve their Western serials, even if it looks like ""Zorro"" with an overly-complicated plot.  1946 saw a similar character in Republic's ""The Phantom Rider"" which had a simple plot but an overly-complicated costume, the headdress of which tended to slip off during the fight scenes.  No such costume trouble here, though the character's influence on the Indians requires the same amount of suspension of disbelief.  But this being a Universal serial, there's a lot of stock footage, with several chapter endings involving Indian attacks.  We have Peter Cookson dressed in black, the better to match Johnny Mack Brown or Dick Foran from earlier serial cliffhangers, and yes, even Buck Jones' stunt man and stunt horse jumping over a cliff into a lake.  The parts in between cliffhangers have a lot of talking to explain the plot, in addition to the narration by Milburn Stone at the beginning, but there is interest in the characters, especially Loma, well-protrayed by Victoria Horne, sincere in her belief that what she is doing is right for her people.  Less successful is Cy Kendall as Amigo Maana, though at least he gets to play a good guy for a change, and one who is very good at gathering information.  There are quite a few conspirators.  Zero Quick (Edward Howard), crooked operator of a freight service does much of the dirty work, with saloon operator Ballou and his henchman Pecos (Danny Morton and Ralph Lewis), and Quick's henchmen Tragg (Jack Ingram), Luke (Edmund Cobb) and the Shakespere-quoting Panhandle (Guy Wilkerson).  Our heroes also get help from another mysterious character named Idaho Jones (Harold Goodman) whose exact purpose is not immediately revealed.  Kirk Norris' main political contact is Senator Mark Halliday (Al Woods), whose daughter Elise (Janet Shaw) needs occasional rescue, with Mrs. Ruth Halliday (Helen Bennett) the main figure among the kidnapped ""Legion of Lost Women.""  And there are a lot of short uncredited roles played by well-known serial-movie actors, including Helen Gibson, Beatrice Roberts, Frank Lackteen, Ernie Adams, Dick Curtis, William Desmond, Rex Lease, Kenne Duncan, Hal Taliaferro, and Bud Buster.

VCI's edition, # 1769 is on two VHS tapes.  As with many VHS editions the duplication quality may vary; the copy I got was an older one, done at SP speed and only a couple minor tracking problems were noted.  The source looks like a 16mm reduction print, with ""Serials Incorporated"" copyright on the main title, reduced in size and with a still-frame background.  The image is reasonably sharp for VHS, and while the gray scale isn't bad there are a few places where the highlights are a little washed out, especially the white letters of the credits against the sky in a couple chapters.  There is some dirt on the film, and occasionally clumps of stuff at the edges of the picture, in the frame during a film transfer.  But it is certainly watchable, and there are only a few splices messing up the dialogue, mostly in the opening narration.  The sound has a few problems, clear enough but with noticeable distortion in a couple chapters, which gets really bad in the music for the ""next week"" titles, apparently taken from an inferior, but complete print and not smoothly spliced into the final edition.  It could have been better, but it is fairly typical for Universal serials released on video a dozen years ago, and unlike some more-recent ""restorations"" the opening titles are from the chapters to which they are attached, with the correct MPPDA certificate numbers.  The ""next week"" titles are spliced-up, as noted, but all present except the one at the end of the first chapter, and as originally issued, appearing through a dissolve from the cliffhanger.

A serial of many interests, if not exactly the most-compelling in traditional cliffhanger terms.  But despite the complex plot and extensive dialogue, it holds up better than many post-war serials, when watched with a day or more between chapters.",1312761600,,5629,5.067172264355363

7930182,1,B000053SNV,"In 1946 Universal decided to drop the production of B films and serials. This was no great loss to anyone, particularly serial aficionados. The scriptwriters of Scarlet Horseman produced an overly complicated, bloated story as though they were working on a million dollar epic but a cardboard story,stiff and artificial dialogue and one dimensional characters defeated them. Gang Busters and Adventures of Smilin' Jack, both 1942 and both on VHS would be much better acquisitions. 1 1/2 stars.",989884800,3,493,5.333333333333333
