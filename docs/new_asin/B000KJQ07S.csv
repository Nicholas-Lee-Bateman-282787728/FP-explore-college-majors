8157311,3,B000KJQ07S,I like Paul Baloche. This DVD is a good overview of band dynamics.  I was hoping for more but I liked what was delivered.,1390608000,,121,4.041666666666667
8157312,5,B000KJQ07S,"I purchased this as we are just starting a worship band at our church.  It gave some good insights to me, who plans the services.  I have passed it on to band members.  It can be viewed in installments. Some segments are intended for specific instruments.  Other segments are for the entire band.  It was an encouraging reminder that you don't need a full band to get started.",1372982400,,376,4.470588235294118
8157313,5,B000KJQ07S,Paul is a great worship leader and his folks put together a great tutorial on starting a worship band.  I wish we would have used this earlier in our ministry.,1371081600,,159,4.3
8157314,4,B000KJQ07S,Paul Baloche has done a terrific job of teaching/mentoring in this DVD.  Would highly recommend this to anyone interested in worship music.,1367193600,,139,5.318181818181818
