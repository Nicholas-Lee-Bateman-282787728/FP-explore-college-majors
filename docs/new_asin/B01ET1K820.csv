The photography and the production are terrible. athey use the entire width of the stage so the photographer has to go back and forth.  The only time ther nis a fully view is if the camera is drawn way back.  The picture is not sharp  as you would expect of something done in 2015. There is a lot of stage business that adds nothing; infact it is difficult to see wahat it adds. The principals are fine.  The singer who portrays the poet sings well, but it is dressed and acts like an early Charley Chaplin bum.",1472774400,,605,4.128205128205129

Mi sono piaciuti i due protagonisti - la Alieva e Castronovo - cos come la Hutton e Zambrano. La regia di Villazon poteva essere un asso vincente, ma quei mimi mi ci crescono proprio come certe inutili volgarit quando non  proprio necessario che ci siano. L'orchestra esegue la bellissima partitura con impeto (qualche volta troppo impeto?). Sono anche contento che LA RONDINE stia finalmente prendendo campo nei repertori dei teatri lirici.
Ah ... but why no italian subtitles?

Perhaps it is better t ogive an english translation? La voil: I do love Puccinis LA RONDINE and am glad to add this new dvd to my collection. I have appreciated la Alieva and Castronovo very much as well as the couple Hutton/Zambrano. The direction by Villazon could have been a winning ace but those three mimes are, for me, uncomfortable presences as well as some useless vulgarities above all when it is so really unnecessary to find there. The orchestra is conducted with ardour and impetus (at times with too much impetus?). I am also happy that LA RONDINE is alive again. Its a very wonderful opera that deserves great attention   Ah, ma perch il dvd non offre sottotitoli anche in italiano?

8759515,5,B01ET1K820,"La rondine is often dismissed (not least by me) as one of Puccinis weaker operas, a sort of poor hybrid between La traviata and La bohme. Puccinis publisher, Ricordi, refused the score, dismissing it as bad Lehr. The hit number Chi il bel sogno di Doretta comes desperately early on in the piece, after which we always seem to be on the verge of another great tune that never quite arrives. Composed to challenge (and cash in on) Lehrs domination of the operetta scene, it charts the vacillations of the Parisian courtesan Magda de Civry between her elderly protector Rambaldo and her young beau Ruggero Lastouc. The poet Prunier tells her she is like a swallow (una rondine) and eventually  to spare besmirching Ruggeros family with the shame of her past  she abandons her young lover to return to Rambaldo. Tenor Rolando Villazn turns his hand to opera direction in this production, new to the Deutsche Oper Berlin last year. I feared his ebullient personality and hyperactive stage presence would transfer to his directing skills, crushing the wings of this delicate Swallow in the process. Not a bit of it. Villazn shows admirable restraint in a straightforward, stylish production that contains a good deal of charm. He updates the action from the mid-19th century to the 1920s, which means that Chez Bullier becomes a chic nightclub with flapper girls and feathers. Brigitte Reiffenstuels stylish costumes look good, and Johannes Leiackers set for Act 3 wittily suggests the French Riviera via a rowing boat and white sands amid the palm court pot plants. Villazn adds surrealist touches via a trio of faceless men  mannequins invisible to everyone else  who escort Magda, almost haunting her. This leads to a neat touch at the end when Magda deserts Ruggero. The Azerbaijani soprano Dinara Alieva, a Bolshoi soloist since 2010, is better known for her Russian  rather than Italian  repertoire, but sings most prettily as Magda. Theres a rich darkness to her voice, especially in Dorettas Dream, but there is also an attractive lighter quality later on which is very appealing. Her acting isn't a strength, regularly outshone by Alexandra Huttons sparky performance as her feisty maid Lisette. Charles Castronovos Ruggero moons around with puppy-dog eyes and matinee-idol good looks  a perfect role for his lyric tenor. Alvaro Zambrano provides a good contrast, a vibrant Prunier, if lacking a true legato. He and Hutton work well as the comic pair who reunite before the leading couple part as the opera closes. Roberto Rizzi Brignoli occasionally indulges Puccinis score with a little too much rubato but draws rich playing from the Berlin strings. An understated, stylish production, which could win round some of Rondines critics. Author: Mark Pullinger",1467504000,3,2763,5.086092715231788

Puccinis La rondine, his hybrid of plot elements of Verdis La traviata, Johann Strauss, Jr.s Die Fledermaus, and Giordanos Fedora with the bittersweet conclusions of Lehrs later operettas, remains far and away his least often performed mature opera. This is unfortunate indeed, for its music is as beautiful and inspired as that in any of its sister scores. Despite a warm reception upon its premiere in Monte Carlo in 1917 (with Gilda Dalla Rizza and Tito Schipa as Magda and Ruggero!), Puccinis usual publisher Tito Ricordi rejected the work as bad Lehr, and the composer turned to Lorenzo Sanzogno for publication instead. Dissatisfied with the works original ending, Puccini wrote revised versions in 1920 and 1921, and even considered a fourth version, but died in 1924 before making a final choice between them. The second version was first staged in Palermo in 1920. The third version was not presented in Puccinis lifetime, and then an Allied bombing raid in World War II destroyed parts of the original orchestral score kept at Sanzognos publishing house. Eventually, composer Lorenzo Ferrero created a new completion based on surviving piano-vocal parts, which was premiered in Turin in 1994.

In case anyone reading this is not familiar with the plot, it runs as follows. In Paris, Magda is the mistress of the wealthy Rambaldo; Lizette, her maid, is loved by the poet Prunier. Rambaldo is visited by Ruggero, the son of a friend of his. Ruggero wants to experience a night out on the town in Paris, and Bulliers nightclub is suggested. Ruggero leaves, followed later by Lizette and Prunier. Alone, Magda has a sudden inspiration; she disguises herself and also leaves for Bulliers. There, she encounters Ruggero; the two discover that they are soulmates and fall in love. Lizette and Prunier arrive; Lizette is astonished to see her mistress there, but Prunier cleverly convinces her that she is mistaken and it must be someone else. Rambaldo also arrives; he confronts Magda and demands that she return home with him. Magda tells him she is in love and will not return, and the angry Rambaldo leaves. Magda and Ruggero move to a hideaway on the French Riviera; Magda frets about the mounting expenses and fears that Ruggero will discover her shameful past. Ruggero reveals that he has written to his father to ask permission to marry Magda. While he leaves to check the post for a reply, Lizette and Prunier arrive, having hunted down the pair of lovers. Magda agrees to take Lizette as her maid again; Prunier whispers to Magda that Rambaldo is willing to forgive her, take her back, and pay off her debts. Lizette and Prunier depart. Ruggero enters with a letter from his mother for Magda to read; it says that she welcomes Ruggeros beloved if she is a pure and worthy girl.

At this point the three endings diverge. In the original first and most commonly presented version, and the one adopted in this performance, Magda tells an unbelieving Ruggero that she has a shameful past which will not allow her to be the pure wife that his mother wants for him, and she leaves him to return to Rambaldo. In the second revised version of 1920, Magda decides on her own to leave Ruggero after her conversation with the poet Prunier and there is no final parting scene. In the third version, Ruggero receives an anonymous telegram revealing Magdas past and it is he who decides to leave her. (In some productions,  la Joan Crawford in Humoresque, Madga then commits suicide by walking into the ocean.)

This production from the Deutsche Oper in Berlin (where I saw several operas while resident in the city from 198990) has a less than ideal staging concept that is more than redeemed by magnificent singing. It seems that nowadays German stage productions have only two modi operandi, both highly objectionable: Regietheater and concept productions. Here we have a relatively mild instance of the latter, perhaps because the stage director is not a German, but is instead a figure of note for other accomplishments in the operatic sphere: Mexican tenor Rolando Villazn! The action is set at the time of the operas composition; well and good, though a few of the costumes among the extras are a bit gauche. Most aspects of the sets and furnishings are traditional; however, the backdrop to act I is a distractingly huge and very poorly rendered reproduction of the reclining female nude Venus of Urbino by Titian, and in act III the outdoor backdrop has a cutout of that figure, which Magda walks into at the operas end. The other gimmick is the constant presence of a trio of male figures clad in white to look like plastic clothing store display mannequins, complete with featureless hemispherical masks over their faces. The three poor souls employed in these roles are required to hold often awkward motionless poses for 20 minutes or so at a stretch, and then given a bit of action; for example, in act I they hold an empty picture frame, and then at the acts end maneuver it around to frame Magdas face as she prepares to depart to Bulliers. Your guess is as good as mine regarding their intended function. At the operas end, Magda takes one of the hemispherical face masks and puts it over Ruggeros face as she sings This is my pain; I therefore presume that they somehow are supposed to symbolize her hidden shameful past and a blank face she must present to respectable society. Thankfully, since the three figures spend so much of their time being motionless, one can largely ignore them.

But, the singing! My heavens, I thought such unabashed, full-throttle verismo emotionalism had died with the 1950s! Dinara Alieva has a wonderfully opulent soprano, a true spinto with seemingly limitless power and an absolutely free top; she could tackle any Verdi or Puccini role that comes to mind, except Turandot and perhaps Lady Macbeth. But she knows how to rein it in for emotional expression, and she fully captures Magdas emotional vulnerability. Although Charles Castronovo (husband of soprano Ekaterina Siurina) has sung at the Met (19992001 and again in 2012), somehow he has escaped my attention heretoforebut he certainly won't any longer. His is an absolutely thrilling voice that brings back memories of Franco Corelli in its deeply burnished baritonal timbre and ringing top, coupled to fluent legato phrasing and ardent expressiveness. This voice is ready for Manrico and Radams, and possibly even Otello. Both he and Alieva have excellent diction, secure intonation, and rock-steady diaphragm support. Its possible that some critics will object that Magda and Ruggero should be portrayed by lighter, more lyrical voices, in a lower-key more intimate manner. I can only respond that this couple is stupendous; Ive not heard vocalism this thrillingly beautiful in years, and I literally had shivers of delight rippling up and down my spine as they poured out gleaming, golden tones. The second supporting duo of lovers, Lizette and Prunier, are portrayed with equal excellence by Alexandra Hutton and Alvaro Zambrano, with their much lighter but attractive, well produced and characterful voices perfectly limning the gaiety of their characters. The comprimario roles and the chorus also sing superbly; only Stephen Bronk slightly disappoints as a rather dry-voiced Rambaldo, but his part is small and the character is unattractive anyway. Along with Alieva and Castronovo, an equal share of the success here is due to conductor Roberto Rizzi Brignoli. Under his baton this German orchestra plays with the sweeping fervor of every Italian ensemble to the manor born; the tidal waves of emotion pouring out of the speakers bid fair to float one right out the door, with a particularly stupendous climax to the nightclub scene in act II.

The Blu-ray format delivers its usual sharp focus for picture quality, and the recorded sound packs a wallop. Subtitles come in English, French, and German; there are no extras. On CD, there have been three commendable recordings made: the 1966 RCA set with Anna Moffo, Daniele Barioni, and Francesco Molinari-Pradelli; the 1981 CBS/Sony/BMG version with Kiri Te Kanawa, Plcido Domingo, and Lorin Maazel; and the 1997 EMI release with Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna, and Antonio Pappano. I concur with the general consensus that the RCA venture remains the version of choice. Of several DVD versions, the previous runaway first choice was the lavish and traditionally staged 2009 Met production with Gheorghiu, Alagna, and Marco Armiliato. But despite its sometimes irritating staging concept, musically this spectacular new version equals or surpasses all of its predecessors in any format. Yet another candidate for my 2016 Want List! If you love Puccini, you cant afford to miss this musically revelatory performance, one that should cause you completely to re-evaluate the merits of this unjustly neglected masterpiece. Passionately, urgently recommended.",1465948800,3,8957,5.047972972972973
8759517,4,B01ET1K820,"THIS Is A Great Production Despite Some Arguably Cheesy Stagework.

AS always and with No Surprise Dinara Alieva Shines and I was also Very Impressed with her Singing Partner, Charles Castronovo, who is Superb as well.

Charles Castronovo has impressed me recently as his last performance I saw, was in Toulouse Singing Sorozbal at Victoires 2016 for Tugan Sokhiev (THE Clip is on YouTube and he is about to join Jonas Kaufmann, Aleksandrs Antonenko and Juan Diego Florez as best Current Tenors).

Charles Castronovo would also be a great Singing Partner for Ms. Alieva in Tosca, Eugene Onegin and La Traviata.

THE Music is Great and I can also live with some Modern Stage Interpretation by Rolando Villazon, but some of the Activity On-Stage by the Dancers is Cheesy and Over The Top (That Is NOT Art And Only Diminishes The Artistic Value Of Mr. Villazon's Work).

I Would Award The Singers 5 Stars, Stagework 3 Stars And The Video 4 Stars.",1464220800,7,943,4.796296296296297
