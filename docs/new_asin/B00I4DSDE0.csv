6250327,4,B00I4DSDE0,"America has been hornswoggled by both political parties. The border is a sieve and nobody in Washington DC cares as they both get something out of it. If you are a poor African American then you just lost your job to an illegal alien as these Latinos do not get benefits. Think the Democrats care about you? They can buy you off with food stamps and handouts. Big Business, supported by the Chamber of Commerce Republicans, need workers they can manipulate. They don't pay aliens any benefits. Follow the money.

Americans get the shaft, and the illegal aliens get the shaft. The film is balanced in that they show that the people hurt are ordinary Americans and the aliens themselves. The coyotes mistreat the people they are smuggling - so watch the scene in the movie  where they discover the ""trophy tree"". It will disgust you.

Hollywood is totally gutless and won't make a movie like this just as they caved to the Nazis from 1933 until Pearl Harbor:

So, independents have to make films like this. I gave it 4 stars as it reminds me more of a television movie. Nevertheless, kudos to the producers, director and cast for making this movie. Telling truth to power is not easy. If we could take Karl Rove and Romney types with their families and include Obama, his wife and two daughters to a real ""trophy tree"" and had it explained to them in detail by one of the victims, they might actually do something intelligent. Don't hold your breath - follow the money and you will understand why both parties don't care about you, Americans already here and Latinos trying to get here, one bit.",1392940800,18,1737,5.080701754385965
6250328,5,B00I4DSDE0,"Outstanding service! Estimated delivery was Feb. 19 - Mar. 6 -- it arrived Feb. 18th.

A tragic story, tho good ultimately triumphs at great cost. Excellent low budget film -- surprisingly good production values, adequate writing and acting, several violent scenes, and a truly evil cartel assassin. Well worth viewing! Slight error in Arizona geography -- these type of illegal problems are more prevalent in Pinal County along the border, not Maricopa County.",1392768000,2,461,5.315068493150685

Watch out for the bad guy! - He's reminiscent of (and maybe creepier than) Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men!

6250331,5,B00I4DSDE0,"I also had the pleasure of seeing the premiere of this film in Lubbock, Texas. I was aware that this film was filmed in the West Texas area and used local talent.  That being said, I expected to see a low budget film and was pleasantly surprised from the very opening scene to the last scene was expertly shot and edited.  The dialogue was humorous and serious and the action scenes actually had me squirming in my seat.  The acting is great, David Armendariz plays the baddest of bad guys and Kenny Maines is great as the everyday guy fighting the uphill battle. Glen Polk, Scott Harris, Nicole Sadler, Elijah Montez and Junior Vasquez fill the movie with lovable characters.  I recommend this film whole heartedly.",1391644800,58,716,4.658730158730159
6250332,5,B00I4DSDE0,"I had the wonderful pleasure of attending  the World Premiere of Jeremy Boreing's ""The Arroyo"", in Lubbock Texas. This independent film  stands out as a ""beacon of cinematic art and story"" . The story, taken right out of today's headlines, gives the audience an up close and personal look at the heartbreak, violence and savagery that surrounds the illegal immigration situation on the Southern border of the United States. Jim Weatherford, the film's protagonist, is played with amazing charisma and understated power by Kenny Maines. The entire cast, made up of local actors, brings a reality and genuineness to the story that is often missed in the glitz and glam of Hollywood. While the film deals with violent and intense subject matter, Director and co-writer, Jeremy Boreing doesn't resort to gratuitous violence and never once feels the need to drop the ""F Bomb""  just to give his characters intensity . This is an intense and powerful story, simply and powerfully, well told .

6250333,2,B00I4DSDE0,This movie's plot was easy to follow. I didn't like how obviously loaded the dialogue of the story was though. It seemed like a right-wing propaganda hit piece bringing a one-sided view to the whole border debacle going on at the America-Mexico border. Another thing I didn't like was how the supposedly good guy was able to run amuck. His erratic behavior seemed to be all Hollywood. The movie went from rather reasonable to utterly unbelievable very quickly. In reality the hero wouldn't have pulled off any of the types of things he was able to do. The villain is who made the movie worth watching to the end.,1500163200,,612,4.623853211009174
6250334,5,B00I4DSDE0,"Loved this movie for its ACCURATE portrayal of what goes on in the border region! We live in Laredo TX and we had a small ranch by TX standards, 152 acres and when we were young we would go out there with no fear whatsoever. Then things got to be so dangerous that we just had to sell the property that we worked so hard to create!! One day my sister and I were down there and we found clothing in a tree just like in the film and we had never seen that before. When we got to the house, as soon as we got out of the truck we heard bullets whizzing by us, lots of them! We just wanted to go out there and view the beautiful sunset and we ended up running for our lives since the bullets were obviously meant for us!! WE NEED MORE HELP ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER NOT JUST EMPTY PROMISES!! BUILD THE DAMNED WALL FOR GODS SAKE AND GET MORE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO ENFORCE OUR BORDER LAWS!! EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD DOES IT, WHY CANT WE?!?!?!",1498435200,3,942,3.9894179894179893

6250336,5,B00I4DSDE0,This movie is a little slow but to the point.  An Arizona rancher challenges drug and human traffickers that are ruining his border property.  Its a slow buildup of events as the drug cartel  bosses begin fighting to take down the rancher.  Very believable plot.  Acting is so-so but still effective.  Good conclusion.  I suspect many of the low reviews are from brainwashed people who do not like the theme of portraying the border as a tidal wave of illicit activities and the intent of some private citizens to protect their own property and lives.,1497139200,,551,4.7368421052631575
6250337,4,B00I4DSDE0,"Always amazes me how naive people can be and unprepared.  The one message I see too much of in real life is law enforcement not doing their job! The last time I encountered that was when I called about construction workers trespassing on my land. After ten minutes I called back for an ETA. They couldn't answer me and asked if there was blood, violence or guns.  I answered ""there will be if you don't show up and do your job!"" That got 5 squad cars in a hurry!  After me till I pointed out I didn't say there was or that I even have a weapon.  I said there will be.... if you don't show up.  They all lft but one who was sure he was going to push my buttons till he could find away to arrest me. ""Pre-assaultive Behavior""  I pointed out they came to me and I have backed up three times.  Best part was county contractors were off my land until the country renegotiated another $1,800.00 to do something I had refused to give permission for.",1497052800,,942,4.171270718232044

6250339,5,B00I4DSDE0,"I'm giving it the full five stars, because I believe this is what the border is like for those who live close to it.  I'm in Phoenix (Maricopa County) so this is the kind of story that is relatively close to home, without the gun play. However, I think that is what it is going to come to more and more as we hear a great deal of talk and are informed by little action; I don't see much change.  I work in security and have had my fill of illegals and what they bring with them, I don't care what country they come from.

Nice work Bill Whittle and crew.",1494892800,2,554,3.972972972972973
6250340,3,B00I4DSDE0,"The movie was watchable. It is a low budget film, unknown actors for the most part. I think the movie was trying to get an important message across about un-controlled boarders, and how politicians are our biggest problem in this area.",1494720000,,235,4.7560975609756095
6250341,4,B00I4DSDE0,"An interesting film about the situation on the southern border.  May divide some viewers because it takes a definite position against illegal immigration.  Despite the contemporary issues it is basically a modern western.  Kenny Maines does well in the lead, and the lead antagonist is an interesting combination of thoughtful and brutal.  Made on a small budget with unknown actors, but looks and feels like a more expensive movie, with good action-sequences for this type of film.",1492732800,2,482,5.220779220779221
6250342,5,B00I4DSDE0,"Sad as it is, this is real life! We must control the US borders and protect our people from the southern migration that is happening. Mexico is a beautiful place and if the people of Mexico would take control of their own country, they wouldn't want to head north for our country. If the US should take control of Mexico, then why would they move north?? Just a thought.",1492128000,,370,4.3768115942028984
6250343,5,B00I4DSDE0,"Enjoyed this movie because I am now educated on the main reason our President Donald Trump wants to build a WALL between Mexico and US. This movie explains why politicians who want many votes neglect the Rancher and/or consumer who need Gov't help on their land because of drug trafficking.

6250346,4,B00I4DSDE0,"One line from the movie uttered by the primary antagonist gives us the premise behind this film. ""Americans are the bad guy, in their own movie.""

One rancher takes a stand against the illegals trespassing on his land with the tacit approval of the authorities tasked with protecting the border. Others join in, provoking 'the cartel' to take action against him.

The killer working for the cartel is the philosophical expositor of the film; who has developed the considered opinion that Americans are essentially suffering from cultural rot; weak, degenerate. He develops a considerable respect for the hero; the only one who really stands up for himself and his family.

The story is not what is presented. The story is not the story of one man fighting back. The story is the story of America waking up.

It is well worth watching.",1490572800,3,834,4.852112676056338

6250350,5,B00I4DSDE0,"Pulled right from the headlines, the movie deals with the staggering problem of illegal immigration and drug running. It combines elements of Longmire and No Country For Old Men. It's tense, gritty and real. An excellent movie. Must see.",1488240000,,237,5.102564102564102
6250351,3,B00I4DSDE0,"I liked the overall message of the film, and I think it's a relatively good look at what's going on down on the Southern border. My issues with the movie, like other reviewers have pointed out, is not on the substance (the plot and the message). It was with the acting, and some scenes that were a little too unrealistic for me. It did a good job of keeping me in suspense, so that's good. But a few things here:

1. It took me until almost halfway through the film to realize that his wife is actually his wife, and not just some housekeeper. And as far as his son, it took me even longer to realize it was his son. I thought he was just some kid he was employing at his ranch and taking him under his wing. A few moments of some tenderness or affection would have revealed these facts to me much sooner.

2. Again, it took me way too long to realize he was an ex-military guy. And in light of this, him failing to kill the guy who was after him on two occasions (when being armed with a sniper rifle and high powered assault rifle. Really? A military guy can't take him out in two tries under those circumstances? And he takes forever to reload the magazine?

3. His son Jimmy didn't shoot the killer who was chasing his family. He easily could have blown him away. So I didn't buy that.

Overall, good film. These were just some flaws.",1488153600,,1338,4.19455252918288
6250352,2,B00I4DSDE0,"I must preface this review by saying that I am as patriotic as they come. I've been serving my country since 2003 and will continue to do so. That notwithstanding, I have to give this movie a low rating, even though it pains me to do so. Here's why: The acting was nearly the worst I've ever seen. It was borderline spoof-ish...if that is a word. This is why we conservatives lose the culture war - we fail to make compelling movies as good as the left does. The story of ""The Arroyo"" is fantastic. As someone that lives on the southwestern border, I can attest that the general sentiment of the story is very accurate. The drama?...whatever...it's a movie. It's accepted that dramatization is part of what makes a good movie. But the acting out of the drama was poorly executed. (Side note: As conservatives, we should be ashamed of not getting weapons handling and sound effects right. Shouldn't we know more than anyone else? Aren't we the ones that complain to high heaven when hollywood, with there never ending magazines and silly ""silencer"" sound effects, misrepresent firearms and the firearms community? Why would we commit the same sins?) This movie has a wonderful message...one that is all but extinct in hollywood movies. That is: We are the crafters of our own lives. That's the American legacy. It's what I and countless other freedom lovers swore to ensure by defending the Constitution of the United States. We cannot rely on government to solve our every problem. Government is incompetent at doing what it is supposed to do; that is to ensure the safety of OUR country and OUR citizens. That is the message of the movie. But it was painful to watch. Obviously a limited budget and I've got to say there are some striking similarities to ""No Country For Old Men"". Hard to do anything original these days, but we've got to do better than this.",1487894400,,1860,4.673780487804878
6250353,4,B00I4DSDE0,"They break out every R-wing trope in the book - no argument there. However, please tell me which one invalidates the overall message?
As I see it, this film is decrying:
Illegal immigration is hurting both US citizens and many of those trying to cross the border illegally.
There are those in the US that don't want illegal immigration to stop - or for it to be legalized.
The cartels are taking every advantage of this situation.
Those of us close to the border are not being properly represented or protected by our police & govt officials.
Yes - it's a B movie. But to me they did the absolute most they could on the budget they had.",1487894400,,636,4.398305084745763
6250354,4,B00I4DSDE0,"I read many of the critical reviews and then watched this movie.  Growing up in the south-southwest and knowing a number of the border families was my attraction to watch.  The drug problems weren't as prevalent and violent in the 40s and 50s as they are now, but they were there.  A number of Texas ranchers would leave small shelters with jugs of water and canned food for the Mexicans walking north. Some of the Mexicans would leave notes of gratitude for the ranchers.  Anyway, C'est la vie.",1487548800,,495,4.590909090909091
6250355,1,B00I4DSDE0,"I know what the director and writer was trying accomplish with this film and I agree with their point but this movie was a hot pile of garbage!

Every character in this film was stupid to the point of unbeliveablity. From the main character who doesn't phone the cops when a deputy gets shot on his property to the chief of police who lets a obviously bad man walk right into his office and rifle though his files before the bad guy shoots him.

6250356,2,B00I4DSDE0,Turned it off about half way through.  Story line is very plausible however unrealistic action scenes.

I liked it for the message it was trying to convey;and, to me, that message was ""politicians are the worst enemies of the people.""  That message came out in the very last scene.  Meanwhile the rest of the movie showed the plight of the rancher faced with continuous invasion.

I think this was well done, from writing to acting and cinematography.  I could have done without the ""Amazing Grace"" song as that song is used way too often in movies, especially independents.  Nothing against the song itself, just tired of hearing it over and over, especially when it is not needed, as in this case.

The film is shot well and it's technically well made. I feel like the director was trying to make his own version of No Country for Old Men, but he's far from the Coen Brothers or Cormac McCarthy. The acting ranged from decent to pretty bad, but luckily none of the leads were awful. David Armendariz is the stand out here as the cartel killer. The 'weaponized ring' he used was really cheesy and not at all necessary to the plot, but he did good job despite the weak script. The characters are stupid and reckless given the circumstances, and make decisions that no one in their right mind would make.

Hopefully ,we`ll get that wall built soon on our border that will prevent those seeking a promise of a better life and freedom from the corrupt governments from which they flee.

But what The Arroyo has is a perspective that is closer to the truth than any Tarantino or Spike Lee film.  That perspective is drug use is not a ""victim-less crime"", as so many clueless Americans believe.  Tens of thousands of innocent people have died because of the American demand for drugs.  The blood of those countless dead are on the heads of millions of Americans who ""use"".  And our country is slipping into a fearful helplessness at its own ability to protect its border and its citizens.  So much easier to deny any of our own culpability.

It did not capture the violence that people at the border cause: killing innocent kids and families. But they did acknowledge that it does occur in the scene where the young man said he would be looking for trouble (shooting at anyone). There were some scenes where the agendas were made clear on where the movie stands.

Most movies that address the border issue tend to portray all illegal immigrants as hard-working, honest folks just trying to get ahead in life, and anyone who opposes illegal immigration as racists. I'm happy to say that this movie didn't fall into that category. It rightfully pointed out that plenty of dangerous people and drugs cross into Arizona from Mexico every day. But in the end, the acting was just so horrible that I couldn't even finish the film.  So I guess it may have gotten all wishy-washy in the end; I don't know.  And when I say the acting was horrible, I mean downright horrible. I thought other reviewers were being overly harsh, but no, they were, if anything, being kind.

The theme was the total lack of control of our southern border and the problems that lack of control including the loss of lives of normal citizens.

If you are pro illegal alien, then you might not like it, but too bad. I found it to be a great movie and a realistic representation of the crap which is allowed to proceed on our Mexican/American border by our feckless Federal leadership.  Our immigration system isn't broken. It works just fine, but its not enforced. Its the liberal agenda refusing to enforce existing law which is hopelessly broken.",1443744000,2,514,4.576086956521739
6250510,5,B00I4DSDE0,"Watching this helps to explain the very complicated issues of the US_Mexico border situation. There are no winners except for the cartel. The story that is presented illustrates the plight of the immigrants abused by the cartel as they seek to come to the US for honest work. It also presents the issues human smuggling poses to local landowners, and the compassion that they exhibit. Finally, it underscores the brutality of the Mexican criminals; especially their total disregard for life and property, not to mention the potential for serious breach of national security. Anyone who sees this story should come away with improved understanding of the need to provide legal ways for honest workers to enter the US while simultaneously shutting down illegal smuggling. The issue is complicated and very politically charged. A good follow-up read would be Darrell Ankarlo's ""Another Man's Sombrero"".",1443484800,,899,5.293706293706293

The drugs, illegals, cartel bosses are just the tip of the iceberg. The corrupt Mexican Government that our weak American politicians continually try to kiss up to are sole responsible for the problems on our southern border. Again this is just the tip of the iceberg what about the Taliban encampment just a few miles south of the border? And yes it's just the first that we know about. Despite the low budget, poor direction and marginal acting this should be required media for all elected officials.

6250551,4,B00I4DSDE0,"It was nice to see a movie that honestly portrayed the people directly affected by our porous border.  Persons that oppose illegal immigration are typically characterized as idiot, redneck, racists.  But is far from the truth in most cases.  These people had depth and didn't hate Mexicans or immigrants.  They just wanted the law to protect them and their property so they could get on with their lives.

The action scenes were all really well done.  Very believable.  I thought the Cartel Enforcer character was a little over the top but it is very typical for movies to develop an unrealistic character to illustrate a point.  Like, when is the last time you actually saw a corporation security chief killing people like it was the OK Corral.

The timing was a little slow but much better than usual for a low budget, non-Hollywood production.  The writing was probably part of the pace issue but directing and editing were guilty too.  The character development was pretty well done.  You actually got to understand where these people where coming from and could relate to them.  The acting was also generally good.  I think for the most part, the acting was hurt by editing.  Overall, the craftsmanship was good with room for improvement - or maturity.  I hope this group works on future projects.  I suspect they will be able to produce top of the line work in time.

I doubt this movie will have much of an impact as most of America is so self absorbed that they won't care about freedom until it personally affects them.  But hey, at least its out there if an honest person is looking for a viewpoint from the other side of the argument.",1438041600,,1645,4.649305555555555

he/she is just  another crazed felon that  needs  to  be taken  out  of the  gene pool,
also
it  was  very  unsettling  to  see a fine  character  of  a  man who  ended  up  like  he  did,
the  international  drug  trade  is  run  by our  goverment(s),

A lot of movies do not have the full spectrum of plot detail that I found this to have. It was overall a very traditional/classic theme of a man taking a stand and facing the consequences of not bowing down. Definitely done with American pride/patriotism as a central point of the theme.

There are also many parts in the script that feel like a 12 year old wrote it.  ***BEGIN SPOILER?***Like when the drug cartel enforcer walks into the police station and starts going through the files asking where the witnesses are and the chief just says ""what are you doing over there?  how would i know?""

This movie makes almost all of the actors look like idiots who have no normal abilities that REAL people would have in the roles the actors represent (especially the main, lead actor who was supposed to have had a very serious, deep, in-the-action military background). Quick example (but the list goes on throughout the entire movie), the main bad guy cuts the telephone line and the main good (ex-military) guy only sees it 4 inches below the wall mounted phone AFTER he tries to use the dead phone. He needs to call from the border to Tuscon (or the police) to warn his wife of the hit man who's driving to get her and their son. As an ex-military and farmer he does not know how to twist the red wire to the red wire and the green wire to the green wire, so in less than 5 minutes he can make all the calls he wants to QUICKLY warn everyone? No, not according to this garbage script. When his wife has taken his only vehicle, the truck, what is his best solution? He rides a horse.

This is a thinly disguised...scratch that...undisguised..takeoff on ""No Country for Old Men"" without any quality acting or script. It's not even as good as the mediocre ""Frontera"" that portrays the same issues.  Along the way the producers decided  (failing any redeeming entertainment value) to turn it into a political screed. It will no doubt strongly appeal to those who write checks to Joe Arpaio and burn incense to Chuck Norris.

Movies that make political statements are fine...as long as they don't attempt to portray themselves as either factual or entertainment. This production fails miserably on all counts.

There are ample factual and unbiased documentaries of America's border problems, and simple examination of statistics is enough to anger most Americans, but we don't need amateur tripe like this to fan the flames.

The script is sophomoric and there's no possible way to evaluate the acting as there is none in evidence.

It was not.  It was on par with a middle school drama performance.  It's like good writing.  You don't notice the writing when it's really good.  The story flows and you suspend your disbelief and go with it.  That didn't happen here with this movie.  As soon as it got sort of ok, one of the actors would... not... act... I guess.  That's the only way I can explain it.  It was clear I was watching inexperienced actors.  I just never got to the point where I could suspend disbelief.

The plot was ok, although tired and more than a little cliche.  Don't look for anything clever or new here.

I guess what I really didn't like was the 'Texas' (or was it Arizona?) POV that 1) the border is a menace and much be manned by armed vigilantes, 2) our politicians are idiots (OK... they got that one right) and 3) Mexican's think Americans are pitiful cowards and want to die and that it's ok to go on a killing rampage shooting women, cops and anyone they damn well please.  It just wasn't believable.

The longer it goes on the more it gets stupid and loses its point.  What this movie really says is nothing complimentary about either side and seems to imply that the border is already gone and the United States has already failed not only here but all over the country.

The story is muddled and like ""No Country For Old Men"" we get a Mexican super-killer rampaging through the US killing almost everyone he comes in contact with and Americans who seem strong and honorable doing stupid things.  In the end only Mexican characters live.

Acting:

I thought the acting in this was generally pretty good.  The minor characters like the wife ,and the sun did not do an outstanding job, but their parts were minor, so it did not effect the film.

I especially liked the acting of the main antagonist, and the sheriff.

The videography:

The quality of the cinemetography(if that is the right word) was very good in this.  It in no way felt like a tv movie.  There were no quick pans, and extreme closeup shots like in TV movies.

The scenery:
I love the south west, and this movie gave me a feel for being in the place.

The story:
I also liked the story.  I could feel the frustration of the ranchers, and was angry at the complacency of the politicians,, and police in the film, for being to afraid, or too disinterested to do their jobs.

The senators character was a little over the top, with him checking his cell phone while giving a speech.

Law enforcement turn a blind eye, some because they're in on it with the bad guys, and others because their lives and those of their families are at risk when they try to do their jobs.

The protagonist felt ""flat"" and forced into an idealized picture of a 'Murican cowboy/southern everyman, and while a ""flat"" main character is to be expected in a cheesy action flick, this movie is not just an action flick. The actors not in primary roles were often cringe inducing in their delivery, the story was fairly predictable but also filled with glaring holes in basic logic, not to mention inconsistent in the details(Is the protagonist an ex-military crack shot or is he a rusty old man who doesn't get much range time?

6250862,3,B00I4DSDE0,"liked the message, and felt the film accurately portrayed the plight of Americans struggling with a plague of unimaginable lawlessness, tacitly condoned by an uncaring bureaucracy. There were some beautiful, scenic shots. However, the editor should have done more showing and less telling. There was an emotional disconnect to what was happening in the story and what I was seeing onscreen. I get that Jim is a self-sufficient, solitary kind of guy. But other than the one scene early in the film where Lina puts her head on his shoulder and tells him to come home, she could have been his housekeeper. He knew he was putting their lives in danger and there should have been more discussion between them to at least have her buy in to what he was attempting, meriting more than a  ""Now, now, dear,"" response. Since she appeared Hispanic this would have been a perfect opportunity to explore the obviously conflicted feelings of Americans of Mexican descent regarding this issue. And Jim's relationship with Jimmy (his son!?) - I wasn't 100% sure if that was his son or stepson or just some kid who worked there or what until halfway through the film. I was silently begging him to just reach out to Jimmy at one point, not sure if I was crying because I was sad, or crying because it was so tragic that they seemed so cut off from each other. Strong men can show their love by their courage and conviction (I will always come for you!), AND with affectionate, tactile gestures. Maybe this was a conscious, Ayn Randian isolation for Jim's character, but I don't think it was particularly effective for this film. There was good to serviceable acting from minor characters, however, this was diminished by their behavior in the film. Maybe this was supposed to showcase folksy southwestern manners, but half the characters, and most egregiously, the LEOs, were TSTL.  All of that being said, there were parts that I liked quite a bit. I did get an Anton Chigurh-ish vibe from the assassin and found him interesting.

6250878,5,B00I4DSDE0,"This is a great independent production!  They took local talent and told a story of truth.  I grew up near the border of Mexico both in Texas and New Mexico.  The ranchers all along the border live in the same manner as those in this story: fearful!

The response by those who would whine about this being too political are those who don't understand the violence that is being imported across our border and they turn a blind eye to the fact that all ranchers from Texas to California have been abandoned by their own government and are left to fend for themselves....with quite a number being murdered in the process.  Those who would shirk this truth are the ignorant of our society and through their ignorance they jeopardize our security further.

The references in this movie to the plight of these people and the fact that the government does nothing to help is not at all political.  It's the way they all feel and the exact way they all speak.  There isn't a single evening that goes by without those on the border lamenting how their government has hung them out to dry.  They are resentful and justly so.  The behavior of the congressman in this film?  This is exactly how they DO behave.

The producers, directors and actors gave a realistic performance and demonstration of what is happening on our southern border, not a political one.  The portrayal of those coming across the border and the coyotes that bring them is also fairly realistic, and there are even many coyotes who are worse than the ones portrayed in this movie.

The southern border is a scary place to live, across the entire length.  There is no safe zone and no area where there is law-enforcement that will truly help.  This movie shows what living near the entire stretch of our border with Mexico is like.  I will be recommending this to all my friends north of the southwestern states.

2. A weak and apathetic citizen elects wrong leaders.  Good call to hire a John McCain look alike as the all-talk , no action congressman.

3. The impotence/un-willingness of the federal government to do anything about the crises at the border.  Indeed they are helping the invasion now.  ""When government is too big , it is bad""...good line.

My only beef is the the extreme impotence of law enforcement.....the killer walks among them and kills with impunity without any law enforcement in the picture.

Based on Present Day Special Investigative  accounts smuggling of drugs, and people is still going on.  The danger to U.S. Citizens living on that border and the rest of us has definitely increased but was present back in the fifties.  New drugs are now coming crossed the boarder along with people (OTM) other than Mexican, including South and Central American, Asian and Middle Eastern individuals pretending to be Mexican etc...  Costs for bring across both drugs and people have increased and if challenged by our authorities the drugs and/or people will be left to fend for themselves by the Coyotes; the bodies found by the locals prove this  The Drug Cartels are better armed and more dangerous.  The film ""Arroyo"" does give our Citizens a real taste of what has been and is today still happening on our border especially since the American Press and Our Government would rather our Citizens not know the real danger we are all in through out the U.S.A..",1406505600,5,1277,4.695067264573991

As someone who ran several businesses in Texas (landscape and construction) and had to deal with this issue of our unchecked and out of control borders, I have seen these problems first hand so I am not sympathetic at all to border jumpers or drug smugglers.

Because of Boreings simplistic political world view, character development is pathetic; bad guys are REAL bad and good guys are REAL good.  That would be okay for entertainment purposes but Boreing has to inject his politics and propaganda on top of that.

About the only flaws I found in the film were very minor ones: Not the best quality pressing (either that or my old DVD player is one its way out); some ever-so-slightly wordy monologues here and there, and a politician who was more a caricature than than a character. But these are extremely minor quibbles about a very entertaining film.

People are paying their way into the US by acting as ""mules"" hauling drugs for the cartels across the border.

For those who carry firearms daily for their own safety and safety of those around them, this portrays accurately the safety, danger, hierarchy of firepower, and reality of firearms in a true civilian and law-enforcement situation. I'm sick of hollywood miss-representation.

I'd rate this at a PG-13 for thematic violence, and the language is very minimal yet realistic.

Listen to the message, it's not racist or any other kind of ""-ist"".  But criminal organizations operating in your backyard, is never a good thing.  I support some kind of immigration reform, after all there are a lot of good people out there that we should be glad welcome as new U.S. citizens.  But to leave things in the lawless state that they are along our southern border, just encourages further lawlessness.  Make no mistake, a power vacuum along our border allows the formidable criminal element from mexico to run rampant.  This movie highlights that.  Ask any Mexican how they feel about the cartels.

6250976,5,B00I4DSDE0,"The Arroyo stars Kenny Maines as Jim Weatherford in the tradition of the classic American movie hero.  Jim is a rancher on the border who is not looking for trouble.  He just wants to work his land and provide for his family.  The problem is a cartel is using his land to smuggle people, drugs, and who knows what else across the border.  When those who should be dealing with this problem don't do anything, Jim decides it is up to him.  He isn't perfect.  He makes mistakes.  He just wants to do what is right and protect his family.

A movie like this needs a good villain.  David Armendariz nails it as Torres, the cartel's very intelligent and very dangerous enforcer.
He just about steals the show.

Be aware that this movie is somewhat political.  That is in the sense that the people on the border are frustrated with what is happening to their land and country.  It is political, but not partisan.  I don't know if the congressman in the movie is a Democrat or Republican.  Doesn't matter.  Neither party has a good record in this area.

A couple of things stood out for me.  The movie feels real.  The actors look and act like real people, not Hollywood perfect stars pretending to be ranchers.

Also, Jim Weatherford is a strong, caring, capable, loving father who just want to do the right thing.  He isn't the doofus dad or man-child that shows up so often on tv and movies.  So, it is no surprise that his teenage son Jimmie is a mature, competent young man.

Hope The Arroyo shows up on one of the better cable channels.  It is worthy of a broad audience.",1402099200,7,1570,4.4125874125874125

I was drawn quickly into the story which held my attention from start to finish and had me rooting for the main character Jim Weatherford and on the edge of my seat. The fact that the story highlights that which is great about the United States and the majority of its citizens is a bonus.

The Arroyo puts a personal touch on the issues this country has with border security and is not a black-and-white portrayal of the situation.  The acting is high quality, other than a couple of clunky extras who come and go quickly.  The cinematography is professionally done with great editing by Bill Whittle of PJ Media.

The villain, Torres, is incredibly menacing.  He almost steals the movie, but the protaganist rancher holds his own.

The character development was great, the ""messages"" were very thought-provoking and honest, and the production and direction extremely well-done. The ""good guy"" was an ordinary American rancher who rises to the challenge of protecting his family and property from the drug-running cartel using illegal immigrants desperate to get to America. The movie had me from the first scene, and there was no way of knowing what would happen next.  There were sufficient light moments to offset the reality of the conflict created by open borders, and how the cartels take advantage of our lack of protection there. The music was of good effect, too. This is a film that should be seen by every elected representative in Congress; it puts a human face on a situation that could be resolved.

A major theme interwoven throughout the story involved President Obama and the Department of Homeland Security's refusal to protect United States citizens from illegal border crossings.

6251008,5,B00I4DSDE0,I really am proud to own this movie.  My friend Mr. David Armendariz plays one of the bad guys.  We went to high school together!  Thank you for a quality product.  You should buy one and watch;  it is dedicated to all the ranchers on the border that dedicate their lives and have died protecting their families! Thank you,1393632000,3,322,4.389830508474576
6251009,5,B00I4DSDE0,"I liked this movie and I am very glad I purchased it. I only have one observation to make here. I think the film maker has made an important point. Sooner or later someone will eventually reach the point where he will not be pushed any further by this lawlessness. What it will be or who it will be, I don't know but eventually it will happen. The sad part is. It is all avoidable but this is the path our government has put us on by its not doing its duty.",1393632000,3,457,3.9782608695652173
8639218,2,B00I4DSDE0,"This could have been a good movie, and maybe did make some good points, but after 30 minutes watching stupid dialogue and unreal attitudes about the risks these two hero ranchers were taking in trying to scare border trespassers I could not take it any more. I refuse to watch amateur film making just to satisfy the underdog-wins punchline.  These ranchers go out in the middle of the night without guns?  Are you kidding?  This is not a realistic movie, maybe in your dreams.",1529020800,,477,4.654761904761905
8639219,4,B00I4DSDE0,"First, I'd rate this movie a 5 except I reserve 5 ratings for movies that result in my researching the issues it brings to the front.  As for the movie - The Arroyo""  I found it very well acted and filmed.  A secondary character -- the neighbor -- is one of the most believably acted characters I've watched in movies.  The movie presents legal and illegal Mexicans in a positive light.  Of course the coyotes are painted as very bad -- as they should be.  Politicians are shown to be as empty fools who will tell any lie to win an election.  The main character is a rancher (cattle) and a military vet who has experienced war.  After coming across debris, including a dead child, left in an arroyo on his spread he ""has to take a stand.""  It is the stand that moves the movie along but the heart of the movie, as I see it, is that humans are human's worst enemies. We chase money at the cost of everything else  Ireally enjoyed this movie!.",1526774400,,941,4.265536723163842

8639221,5,B00I4DSDE0,"Its a politically incorrect movie of interaction between two cultures. Is it good vs evil? Yea, I kind of lean towards the Kenny Maines character.",1520121600,,146,4.88

8639223,5,B00I4DSDE0,This was a great movie! It begins to show the reality that real Americans are facing from boarders thrown open to criminals and government that won't even admit there is a problem. Everyone should watch this.,1512864000,,208,4.805555555555555

8639226,5,B00I4DSDE0,This was a good movie and speaks to continuing problems we face living here in the Southwest. I recommend it to all and have shared it with several of my neighbors and friends.,1502496000,,176,4.363636363636363
