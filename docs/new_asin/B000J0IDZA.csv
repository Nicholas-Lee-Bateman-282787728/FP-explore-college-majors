8516127,5,B000J0IDZA,"A great deer hunting video from Knight And Hale! This is a great video on deer hunting. One of my favorite hunts was David Hale's early season bowhunt where he takes a huge 7-pointer. From the looks of that deer, I wouldn't be surprised he'd score in the 150s. I've seen some hunters on deer hunting videos take some 7-pointers, but that deer David got is the biggest I've ever seen!",1483833600,,383,4.408450704225352
