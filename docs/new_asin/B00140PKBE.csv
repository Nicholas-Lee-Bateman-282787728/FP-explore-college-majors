8253743,4,B00140PKBE,"I watched all three disks, and was confused because I thought #2 was a duplicate of #1.  You only need to buy the first disk, called Life.  The subsequent disks are repetitions of the same commentary and footage seen in the first program.  Very odd, it must have been cut and pasted together in a different format for television broadcast.  There is not much new material in the later disks.  While some people thought the series boring, I do not agree, I thought it was fascinating, an excellent tour around London's sites that factor in Dickens' novels, and some sad insights into the appalling poverty of London in the first half of the 1800's.",1396915200,,647,4.640350877192983
8253744,2,B00140PKBE,"Wonderful idea presented by an informed scholar. The portrayal of London at the time of Dickens is as well illustrated and I looked

forward to Parts 2 and 3. However, had I known that the successive CDs would have been a repetition of part I would not

have bought them. I had to conclude that the all 3 were some form of cut and paste jobs and highlighted the laziness of the host -

Tony Williams.

The comments may be applied to parts 2 and 3 .",1269734400,3,448,4.114942528735632
8253745,1,B00140PKBE,"This is close to the poorest excuse for a documentary that I've ever seen. The supposed ""highlights"" include ""tours of the Houses of Parliament"" - a tour which consists of the narrator standing across the river with the Houses of Parliament off at a distance, seen dimly over his shoulder (the camera consistently shows us a detailed view up his nostrils and very little else) while he attempts to shout over the appalling din of London traffic. Interiors of the buildings are almost never shown, and in some cases we're treated to a pointless view of the spot where a building associated with Dickens used to be - before being torn down. Instead of panning the camera up and down the street to show us neighborhoods, it remains fixed throughout on the sweating face of the narrator who seems always to be desperately out of breath, as if he'd run all the way there from the last location. The noise of London is so intense that one grows increasingly afraid he'll give himself a stroke trying to shout over it. Why on earth would the producers of this mess think we'd rather look at the rumpled narrator than the buildings whose view he is completely blocking?  Did they really not notice that he took up three quarters of the screen most of the time? I'm just sorry I had to give it one star, as Amazon doesn't offer none as an option.",1260144000,4,1337,4.524793388429752
8253746,5,B00140PKBE,"Well done!!  Lots of facts and places to see. Of course some buildings no longer around.
Don't forget Dickens is gone over one hundred and thirty nine years.
Some everyday noise is in background-but don't let that stop you.

Good Show!!",1250121600,,236,4.7317073170731705
8253747,1,B00140PKBE,"Sorry folks, but I was bored to distraction. The narrator should have been OFF camera much, much, much more than he was. When on camera he swallowed about half of the picture. Several areas had VERY noisy, annoying backgrounds. Many places he took us to were only the site where a building USED to be. There's something else there now. Also very poorly done. One example: He said he would take us to the church where Dickens' parents were married, but we never see it. The docu starts out at the Dickens' Museum. We see the outside, but he never takes us inside. All in all, I paid too much for this DVD. If Amazon would take returns simply because of 'customer dislike', I'd send it back in a second.",1216080000,9,701,4.4
