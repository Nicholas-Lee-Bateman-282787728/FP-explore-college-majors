1662523,4,B00005TPLX,"This film portrays the life of one the most talented and genius actors of the 20th century. After watching the movie, I feel as though I have a better understanding of what made this very mysterious young man tick. I believe that you have to get into the mind of a person to fully appreciate them and Franco's performance may be the closest we ever get to actually ""knowing"" the late Dean. the events of the movie show Dean's life from childhood and his struggles to the Big Apple and eventually in Hollywood. It also portrays his personal relationships with his family and co-workers. I recommend this film to any Dean fans or to anyone wanting to know about James Dean.",1023494400,3,671,4.553719008264463
1662524,5,B00005TPLX,"James Franco's performance certainly deserves a Golden Globe.  Not another imitation of a film icon, but a recreation that brings to the surface the emotional turmoil behind Hollywood's rebel.  Excellent portayals by all.",1013040000,3,221,5.666666666666667
1662525,5,B00005TPLX,"James Franco gives a remarkable performance in this excellent biopic of James Dean. The film beautifully shows James Deans rise to fame as one of Americas Idols. It also showed many things about his life that I had no idea about. His quirkiness, his rage against his father, his love for a 14 yr old, and many others. During this time James Dean was the hottest thing in Hollywood, and it was a shame he only did 3 movies. This was a very heartfelt, touching film filled with amazing performances. I had never seen a James Dean movie, but because of James Franco's remarkable performance, I plan too.",1012521600,13,600,4.564814814814815
1662526,3,B00005TPLX,"James Dean, the TNT movie which premiered on August 5, 2001, is a worthy piece of fiction.  Most notable for the remarkable performance of James Franco, any resemblence to James Dean's real life is purely coincidental.  While I am happy that a movie about James Dean's life was made because it introduces this remarkable actor to a whole new generation of people, anyone well-versed in Dean's REAL life has to come away from this TNT REEL version of it, disappointed. Dean's short life was dramatic enough without additions or embelishments.  This movie takes gigantic liberties with the truth which are unneccesary and jarring.  At the same time, it is an affecting drama and James Franco's performance is worthy of the Golden Globe and Critics' Choice awards he won for his portrayal of Dean.  I hope that TNT's effort will inspire people to seek out and watch the original performances of one of the most gifted and unique performers in movie history--James Dean.",1012089600,7,966,4.938271604938271
1662527,4,B00005TPLX,"Okay, pure and simple--like everyone else, James Franco nailed this performance. This film has him in most every frame and he carries the film. The supporting actors are excellent as well, but James Franco is the film. This is a great look into the character and myth of James Dean. My only complaint is it is much too short. This film needs to be another hour longer at least but all in all, the film is a must see for those who are interested in James Dean. Too bad the dvd contains no more extras than a couple of trailers. The music over the film and main menu is soulful and sad and reminds us all of a time gone by.",1011830400,3,621,4.140495867768595
1662528,5,B00005TPLX,"I am sooo excited because i ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS FILM, and i am soooooo happy that James Franco just won the Golden Globe for his protrayal as the hottest hollywood bad boy ever to live.

1662558,5,B00005TPLX,"I wish this had been released in theaters - it certainly should have been.  I LOVE it, a lot.  James Franco knows how to act and he plays James Dean to a T.  I had no idea he was capable of Oscar-winning acting, although he's been very good in most of the substandard roles he usually gets.  As some other reviews state, he pretty much steals the show, and every scene.  Some of the other actors are good, and some are just ok.  Amy Rydell (daughter of director Mark) is superb as Christine White, who was an amazing but underrated actress whose career died long before White herself did, and Amy did a superb job of it.  Rydell himself was absolutely convincing as Jack Warner.  The guys who played James Whitmore and Martin Landau were nothing too great but the guy who played Kazan was pretty good, as was the Italian gal who Dean was in love with.  As James Dean definitely experimented with the same sex, it would have been nice if there had been a bit more of that in the film.  All in all though, this was way more than I expected.  I think Rydell succeeded greatly with what he had to work with - Dean's life was so short and most of those who were alive at the time are now gone, and as Rydell humbly admits in the closing titles, ""some of it was an educated guess.""  Usually TV movies suck.  This one SO didn't, though.  I wish it had been about 30 minutes longer.  James Franco though...I think way more highly of him now.  He should never have done any of those films with Seth Rogen in them because they were so so so way beneath him!",1438560000,3,1547,4.228668941979522

1662581,3,B00005TPLX,AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE IT IS STATED THAT THE SCRIPT IS PARTIALLY BASED UPON KNOWN FACT AND THE REST CREATED BASED UPON EDUCATED GUESS.AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS PORTRAYING MILDRED DEAN AS TELLING HER HUSBAND WINTON WHEN SHE WAS ON HER DEATH BED THAT THEIR SON JIMMY WAS NOT HIS OWN BUT FATHERED BY A BOYFIEND SHORTLY BEFORE THEY MARRIED THUS EXPLAINING THE INDIFFERENCE OR HOSTILITY WINTON EXPRESSED TOWARD HIS SON .I HAVE NEVER READ NOR HEARD SUCH A THING AND I HAVE BEEN TO FAIRMOUNT AND BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HIS FAMILY AND SOME FANS WHO HAVE BEEN ARDENT FOLLOWERS SINCE 1954. WINTON DEAN WOULD ONLY NEED LOOK AT JIMMY AND KNOW HE WAS HIS SON BEING HE BORE A STRONG PHYSICAL RESEMBELENCE TO HIMSELF AND THE DEAN FAMILY.THIS MOVIE GETS TOO MUCH LIKE A SOAP OPERA WHITCH IS WHY I RATE IT NO HIGHER THAN THREE STARS.

1662588,4,B00005TPLX,"Outstanding! James Franco's performance is possibly the greatest performance of my lifetime. He is better than James Dean in my opinion. The movie suffers from a slightly weak script and production value, but James Franco shimmers. He would have won an Oscar if this had been on the big screen. The movie was made for TV and suffered from having a slight TV feel to it. Other than that, it was outstanding, and everyone should see this movie!",1414368000,,442,4.67948717948718
1662599,4,B00005TPLX,"James Dean is a biographical TV movie based on the life of the American actor of the same name. It chronicles Dean's rise from a struggling actor to an A-list movie star in 1950's. Added to that,it also provides a view of his short and troubled life particularly with his relationship towards his father,the death of his mother when he was very young,his love relationship with Pier Angeli,the three movies that he made - East Of Eden,Giant and Rebel Without A Cause - until his untimely death due to a road accident in 1955 at a very young age of 24. This is an enjoyable feature. In spite of the lack of energy to keep it interesting and absorbing particularly to people who aren't familiar with the legendary actor,it is still manages to to hold on to its own and be a starter for people wanting to know more about him for a start.",1412380800,,834,4.422077922077922

1662605,4,B00005TPLX,"For someone new to both James Dean and James Franco this flick was most memerorable. After recently viewing many of Franco's other roles, this is one of his best. I wish All of James Franco's roles were as substantial.",1386806400,,218,4.615384615384615

1662619,5,B00005TPLX,"Regardless of this being a striahg-to TV film made by a network channel, this is by far, hands down, the best biopic I have ever seen about an actor.

Great deal on a great buy!",1378944000,,346,4.257575757575758
1662620,5,B00005TPLX,James Franco was absolutely amazing in this movie.  The time he took to research the role to make it perfect just shows how dedicated he is to his acting.  He was the perfect choice for the part and deserved that Golden Globe.  He really makes you feel for him.,1378339200,,261,4.285714285714286

1662625,5,B00005TPLX,"Amazing, fantastic, loved it, it should have been on the big screen. This docudrama is fantastic. James Franco's likeness to the ill fated star is uncanny.

1662626,5,B00005TPLX,James Franco was perfect playing the Dean. I could watch over and over again. My friends would want to borrow it but i would make excuses to not let them :P,1360281600,,156,4.064516129032258
1662627,5,B00005TPLX,"Franco had his mannerisms down completely, to the point where I thought it was James Dean. He conveyed Dean's pain and loss and we got a deeper look into the icon, which is all anyone could ever ask for.",1358985600,,203,4.230769230769231

I couldn't quite bring myself to giving it a 5 star but it's worth viewing!",1358121600,,294,4.3090909090909095
1662639,5,B00005TPLX,"This movie is what started me on the James Dean obsesssion..James Franco does an awesome job at portraying JD and the producers and set crews did an awesome job matched the new york apt perfectly down to the art and books
The license plate on Little Bastard is a perfect match to the real deal...
He was perfect for this role and it gives you a small insight into what it was like to be a child whos father abandoned him at age nine and his mother died of cancer at the same time and yet he alone struggled his way though to the top!!
Love this movie! Would recommend it to anyother JD admirerers a few mistakes and wrong timelines but for the most part perfect replica",1354665600,,669,4.234375
1662640,2,B00005TPLX,"James Franco may resemble James Dean;  however, he doesn't quite pull off this biographical screenplay.  Other movie star roles not at all like the originals.  For real James Dean fans, I feel this is sub-par to others.",1343260800,,219,4.864864864864865

1662643,5,B00005TPLX,"ANY Franco/Dean fan will be blown away, this was not a well known movie as it was made for TV. It is a little on the expensive side but well worth it to add to your collection.",1321315200,,176,3.7837837837837838

was incorrectly listed by Amazon---not the seller, as he told me he has/had no control over what Amazon puts in their descriptions---too bad as this
was misleading and caused me a lot of extra time and inquries.  The seller was so nice about it and even viewed the video first to be sure it was the RIGHT leading actor (Franco), not the other one erroneously listed by Amazon.  Someone at Amazon needs to do better proof-checking/editing, before
listing items.",1296345600,,612,4.754716981132075
1662645,5,B00005TPLX,"Those who gave this one star must have a purist and extremely critical eye, one no bio-pic of Dean could live up to. Franco does an amazing portrayal of this enigmatic icon about whom many verifiable facts are obscure.

I've read biographies about Dean and the film did a great job giving us a glimpse of what he was like.  Even the biographies touted some rumor and innuendo about the real Dean (and his sexual proclivities - which are of particular interest to many), and therefore the searing expos that a least one reviewer apparently was hoping for does not and probably will never materialize -- at least not without liberal use of creative license.  From the facts we have to work with on his life and various he said/she said, and with the talented soon-to-be icon Franco, this is an amazing and collectable film for all who love and admire James Dean and/or James Franco.

FIVE enthusiastic STARS!! ~ Taylor Siluw, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-With-The-Devil/dp/1442152435/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing With The Devil</a>",1291939200,3,1099,5.447058823529412

1662648,3,B00005TPLX,"I enjoyed James Franco's performance more than this films portrayal of James Dean's life. The film only touched on the surface of who James Dean was. You learn the events of his life, not so much about him as a person. I think there was alot more to James Dean than what this film portrays.
If you are a James Franco fan then you will enjoy watching this dvd.",1236643200,,359,4.217391304347826
1662666,4,B00005TPLX,"To be honest, I purchased this movie because I am a huge James Franco fan. I had no idea what James Dean's life story was about, so I can't comment on the accuracy of Franco's portrayal of this icon. However, I thought the movie was interesting and I got to see plenty of James Franco!",1234310400,,285,4.2
1662667,5,B00005TPLX,"This wonderful biopic of Hollywood icon James Dean begins with his early  estrangement from his father, continues with his struggles to be an actor in New York, and ends with his three starring movie roles.  Along the way, he falls in love and finally learns the reason for his father's coldness.

James Franco gives the performance of his career as Dean.  First of all, the physical resemblance is amazing.  Franco has mastered Dean's speech, movement, and mannerisms as well as his passions and fears, and if you're a Dean fan, you'll feel like you're watching the man himself.  I only wish this made-for-TV film had been shown on the big screen; its powerful emotion deserved a bigger showcase.

The story focuses on Dean's loneliness and conflicted feelings about his distant father (well-played by Michael Moriarity) and has many heart-breaking scenes. James Franco's fine performance makes this one of the very best TV movies I've ever seen.",1230854400,,947,5.032051282051282
1662668,4,B00005TPLX,"I was overall entertained. James Franco was good as James Dean, but I'm not too sure about being Golden Globe caliber. Maybe. He had a lot of emotion going on. The story was good and his biography was covered at a very quick pace, just to get the key points. The ending was interesting, as was the p.o.v. throughout. Hearing James speak as narrator was a different approach than I would have expected.",1221523200,,401,4.506849315068493
1662669,2,B00005TPLX,"They made Dean seem to be one dimensional.  They showed his ""rebel"" side as very dominant with just a touch of lonely boy and jokester.  I couldn't even imagine him ever slapping Pier!  Where did THAT come from?  I DID like the reinactments of the scenes from his movies and the early scenes of Dean as a child.
  I'd like to see a movie made from input with the people who knew him and are still alive to say, ""Jimmy did/didn't do that.""  I don't need his life in chronological order.  I just want the facts.  He was fascinating enough not to need embellishing.",1198800000,,562,4.326923076923077
1662670,5,B00005TPLX,"It was simply amazing. James Franco out did himself. I hope James got something really good out of doing this movie because is was one of the best performances that I've ever seen him in. I was already a major Franco fan but this movie gave me a great respect for the man (before I just liked his face-so sue me I'm female) You wouldn't be able to tell between him and the actual James Dean, it was that good. I absolutely recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good flick. It gave an excellent insight into the teen heartthrob of the 1950s.",1178841600,,547,4.269230769230769
1662671,1,B00005TPLX,"This movie is pretentious Hollywood schlock at its most shallow.  The actors do the best they can with the leaden material, but ultimately its all strictly Hollywood by the numbers as you have always read about it in the gossip mags but alas without any of the pizzazz, because of course they're all impersonating somebody else.

Furthermore this movie really does the late James Dean an enormous disservice. For a start, to make an allegedly biographical movie and then omit probably the most salient and well known detail of your main character's  emotional life, namely the fierce conflict stirred up by his bisexuality, how he used it to fuel his acting, and the way the Studio dealt with it, might be called sloppy or even whitewashing, but then to invent a wholly fictitious life changing incident, namely the character's supposed discovery that he is not his father's son (despite an ambiguous weasel-worded subtitle suggesting the entire movie may be fiction) seems to me little short of scurrilous.  I wonder what Dean's family made of it all?  Well, that's Hollywood baby.",1178236800,,1082,4.988888888888889
1662672,1,B00005TPLX,"I would like to begin by truly saying that James Dean was an actor that met his end before we, as cinema watchers, were fully about to appreciate his talent as well as full body of work.  The short three films that he devoted himself to wasn't enough for my taste buds, and I think the majority of film aficionados would heartily agree - yet I would have to say that those seeking the knowledge of James Dean, the truth behind his life and his devotion to youthfulness - should not (repeat NOT) watch this horrid film.  I realize that this was a made-for-TV film that couldn't take the risks that most major budget films could, but I didn't realize that ""consecutive sentences and structured storytelling"" needed a big budget to complete.  What made this film strange was that it began so strongly with a detailed scene about how devoted Dean was to his trade, but after that, it just went further downhill by avoiding details and the classic cop-out ""educated guess"" technique.  From outlandish storytelling to depreciating acting from the beginning to the end, James Dean attempted to bring Dean to life, but sadly, just drove Dean into another devastatingly horrid car crash.

While I did mention above my disappointment with the acting, it wasn't so much the style of acting, just the lack of excitement.  Dean was played by Spiderman's egotistical villain (hell-bent on saving his father's name), James Franco.  While I feel he captured the audacity of Dean, as well as those smaller details, but he wasn't Dean.  To me, there were scenes that felt as if Franco was adding onto Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man impression/character.  He wasn't original, he wasn't charismatic enough, and the Franco's win of a Golden Globe was completely uncalled for.  He played the part, but didn't build the character, and after all of it I still had the looming thought that Rydell left me with at the very end ... the ""educated guess"" which completely debunked the film - but that is another story.  Sam Gould playing Martin Landau was completely forgettable and I disliked the fact that Landau was such a small part to the story, in fact, by the end, he was forgotten about entirely.  One could say that nearly all the secondary characters were forgettable in the sense that if you blinked, you would literally miss them.  Director Rydell was so excited about having a biopic about Dean in his repertoire of films that he didn't seem to care that Dean was built upon the people surrounding him.  Landau, Kazan, and even Angeli didn't seem to match (or even remember) up to what this film needed to be.  What I wanted to see, and what this film needed to be a pivotal biopic about James Dean, were a foundation based around strong supporting characters adding to the destabilized life that Dean lead.  All I witnessed from the actors involved were a slight movement of their hands, an occasional bit of emotion, and a small segway into the life of Dean - nothing that one could build a mountain upon.  I believe this is why the film's ending was so futile.  We weren't shocked or surprised by the ending, because by that point in the film we just didn't care - apathy had set in, and we were dumbstruck to resist it.

Finally, I would like to say that when you are making a ""made-for-TV"" movie, there is no need to give it the feel of a ""made-for-TV"" movie.  In fact, most of the films that go beyond that point do very well (i.e. see some of Stephen King's miniseries), but for James Dean it felt rushed, fast, and completely underdeveloped.  I have already mentioned about the acting, but the story, which surrounds these actors, was just as weak.  Nothing worked, nothing was exciting, nothing was jaw-dropping at all, basically, we had a couple of unknown actors doing what little they could to afford their current rent checks.  How embarrassing is that ... especially for the Dean estate?  We needed force, power, drama, and humanity all rolled into one, but instead we just found a shallow actor doing a weak impersonation (if one could even call it that).  Not that I could really give away the ending, but there seemed to be about two hours missing from the climax between Dean and his father and the iconic crash.  The crash wasn't even worth the film it was printed on.  Slow motion drama with a random unknown in the passenger side (not unknown, but again, lacking the development) - weren't these techniques mastered and forgotten about in the late 80s?

After watching this film I felt cheated, because I love Dean's body of work and what he represented in Hollywood, but this film captured nothing of the sort.  Overall, I thought this was one of the worst biopics that I have seen in my time of watching films.  It was shallow, disrespectful, and pointless to the end because you walk away knowing less about Dean than when you started.  Nothing congealed in this film because of both the shabby acting as well as the under-developed (which is a word I used too many times and is not shrew enough) story which completely debunks itself as the final credits roll by using the lines, ""Most of this film was based on fact... some was an educated guess.""  Who ends a film like this?  Imagine turning in a term paper with the phrase at the bottom, ""I couldn't get all the facts correct, so I guessed on most of it"" - would the Professor accept your paper?  I think not my friend, which is why I cannot accept this film as a ""real"" biography of James Dean.  This one should be stricken from the record books.  I am sorry Mr. Dean - this film is not what should remain as your legacy.

1662673,5,B00005TPLX,"This is quite a remarkable made for TV film about the intense, fast and tragically short life of the master of method acting; James Dean.

James Franco plays Dean so convincingly that at times it is easy to forget that this is not James Dean himself.

Bio films always take a little licence with actual facts and events and no doubt this is true here.

Overall Franco reveals his own, quite stunning and at times, moving, acting ability and it is easy to see why he is now achieving great things.

As a film `James Dean` is outstanding entertainment and I think even the man himself would be proud.

One thing which needs to be noted is that in real life Winton Dean (James` father) was not the unfeeling, uncaring man portrayed but did indeed care greatly for his son.  Winton had to sell everything including his car in order to pay the medical bills when James` mother was dying and felt that young James had a better chance living with his uncle on his farm.  In fact in James` letters to his father after he had remarried to Ethal they started with `Dad and Mom`.  Winton also sent James money when he could.  Not touched on here was the fact that Winton was also drafted during the war and went to see James when he could whilst in service.  Winton was disappointed in his son`s early interest in the arts as to him it was not a manly interest, but the evidence is that Winton loved James dearly.",1157328000,26,1402,4.378378378378378
1662674,5,B00005TPLX,Mr. James Franco who has taken Mr. James Dean to the screen and video and dvd has done him proud.  We were able to see into the future he may have had at the end from his land where he was going to build his home and plans as he spoke with his Father.  If only the other driver had just stopped and not come across.,1142726400,2,315,3.757575757575758
1662675,4,B00005TPLX,"Great movie!  Although not 100% accurate, it's a great representation of Jimmy's short life.  James Franco deserved his Golden Globe because he was a spliting image of James in his mannerisms, attitude and overall look.  This is probably one of the best movies about Jimmy.  Too bad it couldn't have been longer so they could have shown more about how his childhood affected his manhood, but for TV movie I thought it was great.",1142640000,2,428,4.743243243243243

1662677,5,B00005TPLX,"I was very pleased with the wonderful acting jobs from all of the stars in this film. James Franco was very authentic and believable. Michael Moriarty as Winton Dean was cast perfectly as the often indifferent and cold father. The film was made for TV so it didn't delve into James Dean's childhood very much, but what it did show gave me a good feel as to what it was like. Usually I don't notice background music in movies, but the jazzy saxophone music in this movie really gave me the feel of what New York in the 1950's was like! I highly recommend this to everyone!",1111536000,20,571,4.345794392523365
1662678,4,B00005TPLX,"As a fan of James Dean, I was both anxious and excited to see this film. It is very entertaining to watch, and the performances are superb. James Franco as James Dean is absolutely captivating. He steals every scene, just as Dean always did. He has every mannerism down: his mumbling and awkward persona, the shyness that was often mistaken for rudeness. Franco even comes across as an insomniac (as Dean was). Any Dean fan will appreciate the obvious homework that Franco did to prepare for his role. And the look of 50's New York is very raw and realistic. You can almost feel what it was like to be a struggling actor in that Golden Age.

But I must also warn Dean fans that you may be upset by some of the untruthful dramatization. At the end of the film they (the filmmakers) even admit that many parts of the movie were dramatized and even imaginary! For one, Marty Landau and Christine White were not the only close friends Dean had. They were only a few of the handful of people who knew Dean. But this is a movie... time constraints, you know? The film also relies a little too heavily on Dean's relationship with his father. They make it seem as though Dean spent his entire life's existence trying to make his father proud. They also only touch on Dean's homosexual exploits for a few minutes, and in fact if I hadn't known beforehand about his ""experimentation"" of said subject, I probably wouldn't have even caught it in the film. But I congratulate them on having the guts to include it at all, as many people deliberately overlook it. They also turn his love affair with Pier Angeli into a ""star-crossed lovers"" tragedy. The film makes it seem as though Pier was his first and only love, but if you're a Dean fan you know that he loved many women. Dizzy Sheridan and Arlene Sachs, just to name a few... There is also a scene I found disturbing, in which Jimmy slaps Pier across the face and then makes love to her. I have read all about Jimmy Dean but I have never read that he ever hit Pier. But alas, movies must include conflicts...

It may seem as though everything I've written is a film-bashing review, but in truth, I love this movie! If you're an avid Dean fan you will applaude Franco's performance, but may sometimes shake your head in disapproval at the fabrications. If you are a newcomer to the Dean World, I recommend that you read some of his biographies before you watch this film, so that you will be able to pick fact from fiction. This film still deserves 4 stars... Kudos to the talented James Franco for bringing Jimmy alive!",1096243200,63,2561,4.47008547008547
1662679,1,B00005TPLX,"I cannot believe all the positive reviews of this film!  Mark Rydell did a very poor job of portraying ""The Real"" James Dean...Any real James Dean fan can point out countless inaccuracies in this film and some of it is not just inaccurate, it was MADE UP!  I've read scads of Jimmy's biographies and have a pretty good idea that Rydell took a good deal of the bad stuff about Jimmy.  I thought he made him look like a real heel and ignored the more positive aspects of his personality.  A more accurate film of Jimmy's life is the Michael Brandon portrayal of him that was based on Bill Bast's fifties biography.",1091923200,8,612,4.4375
1662680,5,B00005TPLX,great movie and its a tv movie and i enjoyed it beacause I love James Dean. Franco is really the person to do the job ro retell how his life went and how it suddenly left after the tradgic car crash. thought the movie at the end said the guessed on some of the parts and it doesnt bother me. the actors really doa  good job portraying who Dean worked with. a gem of a movie. a must have in anyones collection or if anyone is a fan of Dean,1065657600,2,438,3.8666666666666667
1662681,5,B00005TPLX,"James Franco was superb and awsome in the role of James Dean. Usually television movies provide poor acting and story line. But this was different. It has great acting by James Franco, and so much happens in Deans life that the script can't be that poor. The only bad part is the running time, because a lot of things happen so fast, I guesse it would need to since it only runs for 95min not including commercials, it shouls have been extended by about fifteen minutes, then it would have been a perfect film. The film was awsome although it needed some changes a little, since some parts were educated guesses. But other than that, the film was awsome.",1055376000,5,654,4.504201680672269

1662683,5,B00005TPLX,"It was eerie how much the lead actor (James Franco) resembled James Dean.  Not only did he look like him, but also he sounded like him, moved like him, and I could swear he was even shaped like him. Several times through the film I found myself saying out loud ""Whoa, That's James Dean""!  This film gave me a great appreciation for how a person can perform a scripted role so intimately with other actors in front of 40 people and a camera in a studio made to look like a little room.  Leonardo was up for the role too, and though I sometimes think he's another very good actor.  He just doesn't have the appropriate voice or look for the role that James Franco provided.",1030838400,5,671,4.301587301587301
1662684,5,B00005TPLX,"Mark Rydell has created a wonderfully entertaining and compelling biography of actor James Dean.  To begin with, he creates a marvelous context for Dean's story---the jazz music, period costumes, and sets beautifully recreate New York and Hollywood in the 1950's.  Screenwriter Israel Horowitz's script is both touching and witty with delightful portraits of various film/theatre legends like Jack Warner and Elia Kazan.  And James Franco grabs our attention and holds it as James Dean---he seems to be channelling Dean--vocally, physically, and emotionally.  Whether flirting with his girlfriend, auditioning for a play, or forcing a violent confrontation with his father (strikingly played by Michael Moriarty), Franco is always believable and moving.",1029196800,,753,5.818181818181818

7953899,1,B00005TPLX,"The film itself gives a disclaimer at the end that it wasn't wholly factual, I think they say they used educated guesses, which equates to we weren't talented enough to make a true biopic, so here is an embellishment supported with totally unsubstantiated claims. As a fictional film about no one in particular its five stars, good solid acting, the setting and ambience are dead on; as a biopic about a real person one star, biopic means biographical motion picture - biography is a fact based history of an individual. So, there isn't room in fact for guesswork or embellishments. All things being equal with a good script it could have been a great film. The script was so inaccurate the James Dean Estate and his family withdrew all connections to the film, the two museums dedicated to Dean neither one carry or recommend the film. Personally I thought the portrayal of his mother being unfaithful or tricking the father into marrying her because she was pregnant by someone else was the low point. Rydell has always bumped his career at low points by prostituting that he was Dean's friend, and considering Dean adored his mother in an almost angelic hero worship makes that aspect quite disappointing. I guess with friends like Rydell Dean needs no enemies.",1486771200,,1264,4.829493087557604
