7817295,5,6301943260,"This was an unusual plot that I felt compelled to watch.  I felt compassion for the child's father who had unconditional faith that his daughter was not dead and would ""resurrect"" at that proper time.  It was spooky but I enjoyed it all the way.",1388102400,,245,4.4222222222222225
7817296,5,6301943260,"I loved this movie since I saw it on PBS years ago. It's a heart warming movie of a loving father that looses his daughter and regains her in the end. I purchase this video and played it to passengers in my bus while traveling to Texas, Arizona and Tijuana, Mexico. Many passenger were emotional at the end of the trip and thank me for the experience of seeing such a heart moving movie with tears in their eyes. I didn't expect this outcome from the movie and I was pleased to see that the movie had touch so many. Years later I visited my old college Spanish professor and I gave him the movie for his class. I give it a double A+.",1237075200,,633,4.112903225806452
7817297,5,6301943260,"I first saw this movie on TV and was so taken by it that neither my daughter or myself could leave the room to go to the bathroom while it was on, thinking we would miss something.  It is a movie that the intellectually challenged would not appreciate, but it absolutely captures the intellect of anyone who thinks on a higher level than bingo. I immediately ordered it and found that the Spanish teacher was interested in showing it to her class.  P Jensen",1182384000,3,457,4.428571428571429
7817298,4,6301943260,"The bereaved father who's lost his seven year old daughter, upon visiting her grave twelve years later, finds his daughter's body perfectly preserved - just as he had left it. His fellow townspeople call the event a miracle but the town bishop wants the child reburied. The father must fight his way through political and religious obstacles to have his daughter declared a first Colombian Saint.

Undying father's love and devotion for his innocent child that perform miracles in Roma - that's what this screen adaptation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's short story ""La Santa"" is about. Moving and heartwarming, darkly comical and satirical, the movie is simple and profound in the same time.

7817299,5,6301943260,"This is a strangely beautiful yet sensual film about the love of a father for his dead child. When a man's seven-year-old daughter suddenly dies his grief is terrible and he visits her grave regularly, finding comfort in the knowledge that he can be near to her.  But after twelve years the tomb she has lain in is to be demolished so he is forced to take her body to be buried elsewhere.
However upon opening up the tomb he is shocked to find her body in a state of perfect preservation.  It is as if she is just sleeping. The man's superstitious but deeply religious neighbours see a miracle in their midst and support him in his bid to take on the Roman Catholic Church with the story ending in Rome and the true Miracle happening in the last few minutes of the film which will surely bring tears to your eyes.
There are many touching scenes, such as the little girl's father buying her, her first pair of sneakers, and his desperation when he realises that his daughter just might be taken away from him, along with the father's introduction to the shallowness of human nature combined with the surprising kindness of strangers.
This is a film that crafted like porcelain, delicate, yet strong, colourful yet tasteful.  Absolutely wonderful!",1075334400,14,1245,4.624434389140271
7817300,5,6301943260,GGM provides an excellent account of the encounter of Latin American and European  worlds. The former shows spontaneity and hope the latter expects formality and respect to tradition. This movie provides a good initiation  into the world of Garcia Marquez,912470400,5,255,5.35
