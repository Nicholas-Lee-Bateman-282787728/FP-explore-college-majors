8141534,2,B000HVAMXC,"I bought this DVD for the 2nd time (as I already own a copy) expecting that these distributors would have at least used a LITTLE more up to date polishing of the viewing quality. IT'S WORSE THAN THE OLDER ONE I ALREADY OWN! I LOVED this film at the show when it came out in the '70's. But for the small screen, whoever released it on DVD didn't bother to clean up the image. The picture quality and the sound are TERRIBLE on this DVD. The cover is more up to date, but trying to watch this DVD is like looking at a REALLY bad bootleg copy. I'm sorry, I love this movie, but this DVD of ""Chinese Hercules"" just can't be recommended due to the VERY BAD viewing quality. You'd probably be better off searching for a VHS movie for this product.",1254787200,,740,4.181818181818182
