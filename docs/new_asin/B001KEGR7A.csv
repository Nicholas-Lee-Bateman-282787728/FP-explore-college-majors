3664082,5,B001KEGR7A,I have seen this on HD and it is amazing.  I have been to a few of Taylor solo concerts and the man gives 110% everytime.  You won't be dissppointed in this DVD it is MAGIC!!!!!!,1226102400,25,178,3.9166666666666665
3664083,5,B001KEGR7A,I was at this concert - right up front. It was an amazing night and I am thrilled this DVD is being released. Taylor takes his place with other greats who have graced the historic Warfield stage.,1226102400,25,195,4.297297297297297
3664084,5,B001KEGR7A,"If you are someone who wondered what has happened to Taylor Hicks or  are wary of buying a DVD featuring Taylor Hicks because of a preconceived idea that he is ""just another Idol"", this live performance will be enlightening.
The variety of styles , the inclusion of song tags and the comradery with his  band that Mr. Hicks displays, are pure pleasure. ""Whomp at the Warfield"" has no frills or smoke screens that camouflage the music; it's just Taylor and his friends having a great time.

Be like Mikey , "" TRY IT , YOU'LL LIKE IT. """,1226102400,39,534,4.428571428571429
3664085,5,B001KEGR7A,"I've seen the HDNet version and have been to a number of concerts.  Taylor knows how to work a stage and those harmonicas.  He & his fabulous band feed off one another for some rousing renditions of both his originals and some covers.  Extra punch from solos by the band members and Taylor tagging great classics into the main song.  I'm excited to finally get this and his sophomore CD, which releases the same month.",1226102400,34,418,4.533333333333333
3664086,5,B001KEGR7A,"I have been waiting so long for this to come out. I've seen the HDNet broadcast several times, and nothing can compare to this man on the stage. He is heart, he is soul, he is passion, all rolled up in one big ball of energy called Taylor Hicks. Having been to 5 of his concerts, I'm so glad to finally be able to bring one of his performances into my home. Watch him when he gets going on the harmonica, see his interaction with the rest of his band, go crazy with his crazy dance moves, and kick back and listen to the edgiest, rawest voice you've ever heard- this ain't no American Idol Taylor- this is Taylor as he should be seen. I'm really excited! (Doesn't hurt any that he's real easy on the eyes either...)",1226102400,21,715,4.188405797101449
3664087,5,B001KEGR7A,"Run to buy this DVD! Taylor Hicks puts on an amazing LIVE show! I've seen this several times on HDNet on cable and can't wait to own a copy! I've been to many of his 2007 ""solo"" concerts, and this one was one of the best! He showcases his band members many times and you feel like you're in the very first row! Taylor Hicks can sing it all: R & B, Blues, funky rock and his harmonica playing is to die for! It was very well produced and the camera work was amazing! OK, I've now bought 5 copies! 2 for me and 3 for new fans! It's even BETTER than I hoped for! The interview with Taylor was worth the price of the DVD!!!",1226102400,32,619,3.9206349206349205
3664088,5,B001KEGR7A,"I waited a long time for this to come out and I was not disappointed. If you are a soul patroller, you will love it.",1269648000,,116,3.68
3664089,5,B001KEGR7A,"I loved this video. Almost make syou feel like you are there. I got to see him live in Florida a couple of years ago and he was phenominal. So I suggest that anyone who loves great music, loves to see someone enjoy themselves and what they do, they should definitely buy this!",1266364800,,276,4.226415094339623
3664090,5,B001KEGR7A,"Yes, I was a Taylor Hicks fan during his run on American Idol and I pulled for him to win. However, I am honestly not biased about this DVD concert because of my fan status both during and after his American Idol days. If I could, I would give this 100 stars. It is that good! No, it is that great!! Both Taylor Hicks and his outstanding band are amazing, unique talents. This was the best concert I've seen since I got to see Elton John and Billy Joel during the original Face to Face tour - and I got to see them live. Watching this DVD made me want to see Taylor Hicks live. But, until that day, this DVD will have to do.

I have absolutely no complaints about this DVD. Not one! From start to finish, Taylor never stops. He is the ultimate showman and musician. How he keeps up that energy is beyond me. This is not the Taylor Hicks you saw on the American Idol stage. This is the Taylor he wanted us to see during his days on American Idol but was obviously restricted. If you liked him on the American Idol stage, you will love him in this concert where he gets to show what he is truly made of - a musician filled with soul and a deep love for the music he performs. You can tell he feels every note while on stage and he is one with his band at all times. And what a band it is! It is one of the best bands I've heard in a long time. Of special note are the drummer, Felix ""D-Kat"" Pollard, and the sax player who also plays flute and percussion, Brian Gallagher. I mean, this band is tight!! And, they are the perfect fit for Taylor. (I should add that it was so great to hear a sax. You just don't hear that much anymore. Real musicians playing real instruments!! Wow! What a concept!)

Again, if you like Taylor Hicks - at all - you will love this DVD concert from his San Francisco gig at The Warfield. If you like Taylor Hicks' music, just wait until you hear what he does with his tunes in concert. He gives them a whole new facelift with different takes than the studio recordings. While I like his CDs, how he makes the songs come to life on stage is something you've just got to see and hear to believe. I always said Taylor is someone you need to watch and this concert proves it. He is at home on the stage. At one point, I could have sworn that Joe Cocker entered his body and took over, and then he does a complete 180 and takes off on a funk rendition of Heaven Knows and The Maze.

Speaking of song titles, I realize after being entertained to the max by Taylor and the band that there are several songs that should have been released as singles and should have been hits. For instance, his encore performance of The Fall fits right into the singer/songwriter genre so popular in the 1970s. Had Taylor been around in the 70s and 80s, he would have surely been a bigger hit than he is now. Incidentally, I can't believe he is not as huge a success as he should be, especially in light of the mediocre talents of so many who are idolized by the young CD buying / iTunes downloading public. But, I digress about the songs that should have been hits - The Maze is a nod to the Maroon 5 sound (and that's a good thing!) and should have been a hit. Wherever I Lay My Hat is a superb tribute to the great Marvin Gaye. The heartfelt My Friend (an early recording for him) was moving and could have been a hit for him if reintroduced to the public. He could have done a remix of Heaven Knows (a great song already in its original form) with the funk he does so well and had a hit with it. They (record company, powers that be, etc.)did him wrong by not releasing more singles and not promoting his first album after his American Idol win more.

Then, there's the song Give Me Tonight which would have been my pick for his first single off that album. It shows off his pop side. But, there's so many sides to Taylor and they are all filled with talent and pleasant surprises - including pop, soul, rock, R&B, the blues, funk, you name it. Sometimes, he and his band blended them all into one for a truly unique Taylor and the band style. Just when you think it couldn't get any better - it does! During his encore, he breaks into a tribute to Eric Clapton with the Eric and George Harrison penned Badge. Badge has always been a favorite Cream song of mine and Taylor and the band put their own spin on this great classic. Then, after being on stage and never stopping for a moment to take a breath, they rip into Sly and the Family Stone stylings with Naked In The Jungle and I Want To Take You Higher. Superb! And, what a way to end the concert. Yet, it left me wanting more.

Taylor Hicks should be a bigger star than he is. Watch this DVD concert and I'm sure you'll agree. If you have any reservations about buying this, toss those reservations aside and purchase it. It is worth every penny. I would pay triple to have this in my library. As soon as I watched it, I wanted to immediately watch it again. If you like Taylor, you'll love this concert.

I said I had no complaints. If I did, it would not be about this DVD or the concert. It would be that I wish there was a companion CD so I could have these great new inventions of the Taylor Hicks set list on CD as well as his takes on the aforementioned classics such as Clapton & Harrison's Badge. Oh, and if you're wondering, yes he shows his talents on his well loved instruments - the harmonica, guitar and organ. Taylor is an amazing, unique talent. His band is amazing and among the best I've ever heard. Together, Taylor and his band are dynamite. How anyone could not feel entertained, moved and feel better while watching and after watching this concert would boggle my mind; like it boggles my mind he is not on the top of the charts. He should be!

I hope Simon Cowell has seen this concert. We all know that Simon was never much of a Taylor fan. This concert shows just how wrong Simon was.

If you are a Taylor Hicks fan, you must have this DVD!",1266019200,,5927,4.165794066317627
3664091,5,B001KEGR7A,It has been a long wait for this video but it was worth it!!  I love it and give it 5 stars!!,1265587200,2,93,3.227272727272727
3664092,4,B001KEGR7A,"Having seen Taylor several times on his first post-idol major tour, I was looking forward to grabbing this DVD as a souvenir of those memorable shows. ""Whomp At The Warfield"" finds him in great form, with a top-notch band backing him. His ability to blend pop, rock, soul, and blues served him well on idol, and continues to serve him in a live setting, where he is truly in his element. He directs the band with head nods and hand signals, and freestyles by weaving songs within songs, and stretching songs out into 6 or 7 minute jams. Taylor hits his pinnacle here on his own songs, namely ""Heart and Soul"", and ""Hold On To Your Love"". Add to that list ""Soul Thing"", the song I consider his personal anthem, which describes both the trials and rewards of the road (and a little bit of ""Eastbound and Down"" tagged in for good measure). The appeal of Taylor Hicks is his obvious love of being onstage. His total involvement in the music gets his audience and his band equally involved. In a time of studio-created artists, it's great to see Taylor Hicks carrying the torch for the art of live performance.

There were two thing that prevented me from rating this DVD a full 5 stars. One was the camera work and editing, which was a bit frenetic at times, plus the lack of a good angle from the front. Filming Taylor from the waste up during ""Naked In The Jungle"" was a bit like Elvis on the Ed Sullivan show. Also, Hicks' stage banter at that point had not quite evolved from his bar days, with most of the introductions starting with ""this is a tune..."" and not much after that. He makes up for that shortfall with his bonus interview, where he gave a little insight on the inspiration behind his songs of his pre-idol acoustic songs: ""Son Of A Carpenter"" and ""In Your Time"" followed by excellent solo acoustic performances of each.

Overall this is a great concert DVD I would recommend to any fan, especially those who know Taylor Hicks only from his stint on American Idol. This DVD defines who Taylor Hicks is as an artist far better than his 2 minute performances on the show, or even his albums have captured to date. I give it a solid 4 stars out of 5.",1265500800,3,2160,4.424623115577889
3664093,5,B001KEGR7A,"I watched the bonus interview with Taylor Hicks first and felt like he gave us a glimpse into his world as a performer and a songwriter.  During the interview, he performed two acoustic songs (Son of a Carpenter and In Your Time) that he had written himself as a young man (and had included on his very first album).  Very nice!  The concert itself was full of skillful, energetic and fun performances by Taylor and his talented band.  Favorites of mine were: The Fall, which he again performed acoustically, The Right Place, which really shows his soulful side, and Heaven Knows/The Maze with his extra ""tags"" of different songs.  Also outstanding was his encore of Badge and Naked in the Jungle (with a tag of Dance to the Music).  I really felt as though I was there and didn't want it to end.  From start to finish, I loved this DVD!  (Can't wait for the next concert from Taylor Hicks - and hopefully I'll be there live!)",1265500800,,926,4.502994011976048
3664094,5,B001KEGR7A,"I had ordered two copies of Whomp At The Warfield from another source and only got one.  They were out of stock quickly.  When I found out that Amazon had it available I hurried over here to order my copy.  I had given the other one to my sister as a belated Christmas gift.

We watched it together and couldn't wipe the smiles off our faces.  Both of us had been to several of Taylor's concerts, although not this particular one, and we really wanted a ""Taylor Fix"" as we refer to it -- yes the man and his music are addictive.  This DVD is terrific and seasoned Soul Patrol fans and newbies alike will thrill to the magic that is Taylor Hicks.  He not only has a wonderful whiskey tenor voice but he is an accomplished musician, song writer and leader of the band.  He put together an exceptional group of musicians and a great back up singer and they gel wonderfully. You will thrill to the man and his music as he becomes one with the beat and dances and moves as only he can, often playing guitar and blowing on his harmonica.  He truly feels the music and that's what makes him and his music so special.  Another unique guality that Taylor has is the ability to tag other songs into the one he is singing.  It is seemless and a joy to listen to.  There is always the element of surprise with Taylor and his infectious smile can light up the entire theater.

I rate this the total 5 stars and would make it higher if I could.  This man is an Entertainer with a capital ""E""!!!!",1265241600,,1481,4.224199288256227
3664095,5,B001KEGR7A,been waiting for a long time to see this show and I was not disappointed!  Taylor and band both were ON!  Great fan interaction and I love the way he put everything he has in the music!  A must-see!,1264982400,,198,4.0256410256410255
3664096,5,B001KEGR7A,"He calls it ""Whomp"" music.  Whatever it is, I can't get enough of it!  Taylor Hicks has put together an unbelievably talented band, and the total effect of his vocals with their instruments is phenomenal.  I was especially impressed to see that he was the executive producer of this DVD.  It has a great selection of songs and the performances are flawless.  The beat just pulls you in and I guarantee you can't sit still while you watch it!  Taylor is very animated, and I actually enjoyed his moves, even remembering how Simon Cowell told him on the American Idol show that his dancing around was silly.  (I do think he could use some dance lessons!)  Seriously, Whomp at the Warfield is my favorite DVD...I can't imagine anyone not loving it!",1264291200,,745,4.633587786259542
3664097,5,B001KEGR7A,"This concert is spectacular from start to finish.  Fans of Hicks already know what to expect musically:  a focused, intense Hicks fronting a tight, funky, bluesy band.  We get numerous original tunes, along with well chosen - and unpredictable - covers.  Bits and pieces of other songs (""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"", ""Lonely Avenue,"" ""Dance To the Music"") are sprinkled in amongst the setlist despite not being ""officially"" listed.

The 84 minute show was taped during Hicks' post-Idol tour in '07, this stop was at the famous Warfield Theater in San Franciso.  He was still riding high in the wake of his victory, the press - and certainly not the public - hadn't turned on him yet.  The crowd is enthusiastic, but thankfully we are spared excessive shots of them.  The focus is on Taylor and his seven piece band.  The musicians are all spotlighted with solos throughout.  The rhythm section is especially impressive.  Hicks plays guitar, acoustic and electric, as well as several harmonica solos.  His vocals are strong and impassioned.

The video and audio (including a 5.1 surround mix) are of excellent quality.  This was a professionally recorded show.

The bonus feature - billed as ""An Interview with Taylor Hicks"" - is actually a 30 minute long featurette that includes solo acoustic performances of two songs not featured in the concert.  Hicks introduces each with some background on the songs.  The interview is very interesting, demonstrating his deep appreciation of music.

If you're a fan - someone who follows Hicks' every move, or maybe someone who liked him on American Idol and haven't seen him since - this is a must-have DVD.  If you aren't a fan - drop all the preconceived notions you may have about him being the ""worst Idol winner"" and all that nonsense.  If you like old school r&b, soul, and blues rock then you are sure to enjoy this concert.",1262822400,6,1869,4.8544303797468356
3664098,5,B001KEGR7A,"Have seen the original footage of this when it broadcast on HDNET and it's brilliant..
I was next to the stage for this amazing show, and Taylor Hicks and his band were nothing short of extraordinary..

I know skeptics who were there with me as well, and they were all blown away by the incredible performances on each song..
I stood next to one of the 6 videographers located around the Warfield Theatre, and the guy I was next to, who has shot dozens of live concert shows around the world, told me when it was over that he was hugely impressed by Taylor and his band.. In fact, he used the word ""shocked"" as well, which says it all...

Taylor brought together a superb band for this post-Idol win tour, including the stunning guitarist Josh Smith & Al ""Boogie"" Carty on bass,  Brian Gallagher on horns, and excellent keyboardist/arranger Loren Gold as music director...
The solos from Brian & Josh are hot beyond belief..

So many people don't have any idea of what a fantastic musician Taylor Hicks actually is, b/c of holding on to preconceived notions from seeing one show on American Idol.
This LIVE concert DVD will transform any and all misinformation, and is worth every penny...",1262736000,3,1189,4.647619047619048

I was lucky enough to see him live 7 times and would see the same show over and over. This video is a must have for all Taylor fans and a must have for people who are not fans yet, because you will be fans after getting a chance to see him perform in concert.

He was terrific on AI, and I loved him from the beginning. But to see him with a band, and the energy and talent he puts into the concert is just amazing.  He never does any song the same way twice!",1233705600,3,450,3.923076923076923

Now, mind you, my friend and I live in a big city and have seen tons of concerts, many big-name singers and bands.  After the Taylor show was over, we compared notes.  We both agreed it was the best show we'd ever seen in our lives.  Taylor Hicks has to be seen live to be believed.  The reason he won American Idol is because he's a great entertainer.  He's got incredible energy, a whiskey tenor voice which is perfect for the type of music he does, and he never performs a bad song.  He doesn't stop moving onstage as he hits you with one great number after another.  It'll be fun to pop in this DVD whenever I want a Taylor concert fix!",1232755200,8,713,4.153284671532846

I've seen Taylor live at least a dozen times.  Some good stuff on this DVD, but don't rush out to waste your money.

Taylor Hicks' band is outstanding, too.  Hicks was on ""American Idol"" before they let people play instruments in competition, so on this DVD it's great to hear him play acoustic and electric guitar, and of course, his harmonica.  If you liked Taylor on A.I. back in 2006, you'll love this concert.  If you didn't like Taylor before, watch this concert and you just might change your mind.  Stay tuned for the interview in the end where Taylor Hicks performs a few more acoustic songs.
The talent of the winners of ""American Idol"" has been steadily going down the last few years.  Taylor Hicks was the last winner with true star quality.  ""Whomp at the Warfield"" proves it.",1275091200,2,847,4.793103448275862

Some outstanding moves are shown on Hold On To Your love. He displays masterful talent in tagging and voice changes, such as in ""I Live On A Lonely Road"" during Hold On To Your Love. The Runaround is always a crowd pleaser. He moves from the raucus to the tender and delicate sounds of ""If It's Loving that You Want"". Taylor uses his whole body as another instrument that he plays as well as the ever sensational harp. He and his oustanding band become united in their tight performance. I've played Whomp At The Warfield several times and all members of the band are showcased to add to the unity of the show. Even the audience is fun to watch as some are so emotionally involced or even left in a trance.
Then there is the bonus feature. Taylor explains sevral things just as though he were talking to you in your livingroom. He also displays his sense of humor when talking about the women's items thrown on the stage during performances. This DVD is a delight.
