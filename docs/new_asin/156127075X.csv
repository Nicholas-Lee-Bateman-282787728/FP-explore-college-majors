7796153,4,156127075X,Typical Alvin Alley production but with several narratives by Ailey himself.,1525305600,,76,6.0
7796154,5,156127075X,"The four ballets presented on this tape show not just the Ailey company at its best, but serve as a sort of testament to Ailey himself. Two of the works (""Divining"" and ""The Stack-Up"") are works by two choreographers among many Ailey made a ""home"" for; the former work is by former Ailey dancer and current Artistic Director Judith Jamison, the latter by the late Katherine Dunham protege Talley Beatty. The whole reason I bought the tape though, was for ""Cry,"" Ailey's 1971 tour-de-force orginally created for Judith Jamison. Though the soloist recorded here (Deborah Manning) is more than equal to the task, I will still always wish I had had the opportunity to see Jamison dance it in person.",920505600,25,695,4.8
