8036938,5,B00062IDQA,"Ken Davis videos are usually pretty repetitive - he has a relatively limited repertoire, so I didn't expect much new material from this video.  However, Mr. Davis shares the stage with 4 other comedy acts: Nazareth, Darren Streblow, CPR, and Jeff Allen.  The humor quality is comparable to watching Bill Cosby: Himself.  Two of the acts, Darren Streblow, and especially Jeff Allen, relate their life experiences to their Christian faith and its impact on their comedy and their family life.  As Ken Davis said after Jeff Allen told his story, ""Long after you forget the punch lines, you will remember that story.""  It's worth hearing and remembering.

I and my daughter's teenage friends enjoyed this video on several viewings.  (So did my daughter, actually.)",1109203200,,760,5.080645161290323
