1172872,5,9089707182,"Beautiful images.  Like many of these dvds, the sound options could be better, but this served my purposes very well. I prefer the water sounds.",1405555200,2,144,4.76
1172873,2,9089707182,"This disc missed the mark with poor audio options.  Even worse were the distracting reflections of the sky and clouds that obscure your view of the jellyfish.  The light reflecting off the surface of the water was very annoying.  I am giving my copy away.  The production year is not shown anywhere on my disc or disc case.  This may have been very nice when first introduced, but the Blu-Ray Art of Nature Jellies disc is ever so much better.",1402531200,,443,4.4875
1172874,5,9089707182,"This is a BEAUTIFUL DVD! I would have given it 5 stars but the ocean wave sounds threw me off. There wouldn't be ocean sounds under water. I liked the music they had and the jellyfish were beautiful. Especially with the changing colors when the sea jellies were on. I own MANY of Tony Helsloot DVD's of nature and I've NEVER been disappointed.

If ""Nikki"" found a better jellyfish DVD by contacting a national aquarium, I REALLY would like to know which aquarium it was, I'd buy that one too! Jellies are so calming to watch and I haven't found many DVD's around showcasing them.

UPDATE:  I originally gave this 4 stars (because of the ocean waves which wouldn't be underwater) but I've reconsidered to 5 stars because I've now watched it twice in less than 2 days and know I will be watching it very often. I just hit the mute button when the ocean waves come on. Tony Helsloot's Isis Asia DVD's are ALWAYS a great show and I look forward to finding even more of them. As a long time buyer of his products, I HIGHLY recommend his DVDs!!!

NEW UPDATE: Since Anne Marie figured out that the DVD ""Nikki"" was talking about (see comments under ""Nikki's"" review), I'm even stronger in my opinion that this DVD is the best one. I already owned the other one and while it's a nice DVD, I liked this one SO much better! From her description of the one she liked so much, I didn't even connect the dots to realize she was talking about one I had previously bought. I stand with my 5 star review on this DVD!!",1385942400,6,1500,4.3464285714285715
1172875,5,9089707182,"I totally disagree with ""Nicki"". This is a terrific DVD and actually of high quality on my DVD player so don't be put off by the review.  The backgrounds of this collection are plain and only add to the beauty of this exceptional DVD so again no idea what this person is saying? If you love jellyfish this is definitely for you.  I own a lot of worldnaturevideo DVD's and always look at the samples first which are online and easy to source...",1385942400,5,443,4.325301204819277
1172876,2,9089707182,Pros: shipping was super fast and DVD has several different jellyfish to look at.....Cons:I looked at quite a few jellyfish DVDs on amazon and tried to go with the one that had the best ratings. It was between this one and something else... Honestly when I received this DVD I was a bit disappointed. The quality wasn't that great at all. I was expecting something more beautiful with a black background so u could truly appreciate the jellyfish. This was far from that. I ended up contacting a national aquarium with a jellyfish exhibit and purchasing their DVD and it is simply GORGEOUS! Wish I had did that from the start..I recommend anyone looking for a great jellyfish DVD to do the same.,1384473600,9,694,4.650406504065041

1172894,5,9089707182,The slow movement of the jellyfish is very relaxing and the types of jellyfish and different backgrounds makes for enough variation for me..this is a great relaxation video and I will use it frequently,1410220800,2,201,4.9411764705882355

1172896,2,9089707182,"I was disappointed in this DVD.  The fish don't look real, but rather look animated.  I love jellyfish and was looking forward to using this DVD as an 'aquarium'.",1405900800,,162,4.551724137931035

7901428,1,9089707182,I hate this video. I wanted to see real jelly fish in their natural environment. I think they are real jelly fish but it CGI environment or something.  Fake bubbles.  It really sucks.,1506729600,,183,4.515151515151516
7901429,5,9089707182,120 minutes of beautiful translucent jellyfish.  Some scenes of large pulsating jellyfish with long thin tentacles or wider puffy tentacles.  Some scenes of smaller pulsating jelly fish with no tentacles. Scenes with changing colored lights that lend color to the jellyfish.  Menu contains many choices of jellyfish scenes and audio accompaniments.,1496534400,,348,5.784313725490196

7901431,3,9089707182,"I was hoping for a more natural look at jellyfish (watching them float around in an ocean or tank for hours).  This had lots of special effects (color changing, image layering). Some brief, beautiful jellyfish moments but not quite the jellyfish experience I was seeking.",1493164800,,271,5.022222222222222
