8574226,4,B00BUV9XCE,"I ordered the digital copy as it is the original HK version, not english dubbed. There are a few scenes included that are not included in the dubbed version, and some in the dubbed version not included in this cut.

I love this film. It's hilarious--showing a side of Donnie Yen that I believe he is coming back to after films like Painted Skin, Monkey King, and Iceman Cometh. I believe I have read that they took an entire year for principal photography. You can see how spectacular the martial arts sequences are because of that. All pure physical performance-there are very few undercranked or wire shots.

If you are a Donnie Yen fan or a martial arts film collector, this one is definitely worth your while.",1396483200,2,713,4.606299212598425
8574227,5,B00BUV9XCE,"This movie is nonstop action and comedy exellent fight scenes to I would reccomend this flik to all JC, donny yuen, hwang jang li, and adam cheung fans If you thought Drunken master was cool you'd like this one more even though there is not much Drinking or tai chi only at the end Donnie yuen drinks a lot and fights this one fool with ""the soft style"" the last scene is worth byuing the movie!!!!",971308800,2,398,4.25
8574228,5,B00BUV9XCE,"Although we don't see Donnie Yen getting drunk and smacking people around,we definately have a great movie here,along with a great cast. Donnie stars as a young man who gets in a scuffle with the town brat. After a  second confrontation,Donnie and his brother(Yuen Yat Chor) tie up the local  bully in fireworks,and accidentally set them off. After finding out Donnie  made his son go crazy,the rich kid's father hires a professional  assassin(Yuen Shun Yee,in a role similar to the crazed opera performer he  portrayed in Dreadnaught).After his family is killed,Donnie ends up living  with a crazy old man(Yuen Cheung Yan) and his wife. When the killer catches  up to Donnie he makes quick work of him,with Donnie barley escaping with  his life. He learns the Tai Chi style to counter the killer's hard fighting  style,and eventually kills the assassin. Yuen Cheung Yan's character is  absolutley hilarious,complete with buck teeth and his wine jug. Very similar  to the characters he portrayed in Taoism Drunkard,and Shaolin Drunkard. The  dubbing adds to the comedic effect,as he is dubbed very well. It would be  ten times better if I could see it in widescreen. The fights are great as  usual. I believe the movie came out in 1983 when the fight choreography was  constanly getting better and better.",954547200,3,1305,5.004651162790697
