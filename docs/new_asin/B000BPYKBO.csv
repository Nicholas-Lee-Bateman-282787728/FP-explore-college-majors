8090844,5,B000BPYKBO,"I have watched this film like 30 times.... It goes fast, but is really really good stuff. A snapshot of the culture mixed that's pure escapism and fun.",1249171200,,151,4.428571428571429
8090845,5,B000BPYKBO,"If you are looking for good information that might help you prepare for a bone-fishing trip, look elsewhere, if you want to reinforce why you are going... buy this DVD.  The photography and scenery is of the highest quality.  Watching two fishing legends, working together to get a fly down to the ""big bonefish"" simultaneously raises my heart rate and lowers my blood pressure.  My family gave me grief over the per-minute cost of the video compared with commercial film at half the price and six time the length.  I will still be enjoying this DVD when Transformers XV is grossing a billion dollars.",1183939200,4,601,4.75
8090846,5,B000BPYKBO,I loved this film. Why? It is a little piece of art that I take out a few times a year to share with friends. My angling buddies always salivate when the first scene opens and the water laps on the bow. From there we follow the comically infectious obsession of the anglers on the boat chasing bonefish (using only a fly rod) and all the while - the old Bahamians add color commentary and generations of stories from the dock. This is just pure fun and something that I've watched more times than I can remember.,1177545600,4,512,4.288659793814433
8090847,5,B000BPYKBO,"I first saw this short film (22 minutes) at the Great Falls Montana Fly Fishing Film Festival. And, I heartily recommend it.

Rising Tide took home the audience prize and warmed a lot of hearts during that winter exhibition. The film was the first film by The HowardFilms guys (they made the tarpon series Chasing Silver - which is now in the IGFA Hall of Fame) and the time spent with generations of guides on Andros (Bahamas) and the amazing cinematography make it unusual in a world of quickly shot ""fish videos""...No, it is not a How-to either. But simply a one-time escape withtwo lifelong Bahmamain Bonefish Guides, showing skills few mortals can match, and a trip that I doubt will be seen on film again.",1177372800,3,711,4.642857142857143
8090848,1,B000BPYKBO,Probably the worse DVD I have ever viewed.  I don't suggest anyone buy this selection!,1175990400,,86,4.733333333333333
8090849,5,B000BPYKBO,This is agreat DVD. So many of the bonefishig DVDs are terrible photography and too much talking about nothing. This is DVD that will help you escape the winter blues and see some great fishermen tell their stories and chase some big fish. I have watched this DVD every year before the season and it always gets me excited to go fish.,1172880000,,334,4.403225806451613
8090850,2,B000BPYKBO,"I'll agree that the production values are good.  I've been bonefishing at Andros and this brief 25-minute(!) DVD does a good job of showing us the incredible beauty of Bahaman fishing, as well as convincing us that there certainly are some HUGE bones cruising in certain (secret) spots there, although no monsters were actually landed.  As a travel brochure it's great.  However, as a lover and student of the sport I was sorely disappointed by the almost complete lack of information and the superficial treatment of the content.  As it practially suggests in the opening, this is really a couple hall-of-fame bone fishers indulging in the sport they love and reminiscing a bit, like watching Jordan and Bird talk about back in The Day and making a few trick shots.  And this is fine if that's what you want out of a fishing video, but don't read the publisher's endorsements and think you're getting anything more than this.  Also, I'm very disappointed in the DVD production, which has no menu (because there are NO extras at all) and no navigation, and, at least on my system, it ran pretty rough.  Seems amateurish considering the good filming.

Bottom Line: If you want to see some great old pro's messing around in  the best of the Bahamas (at a cost of a buck a minute), then go for it.  If you want something to really sink your teeth into, I'd recommend Trout Bum Diaries (I have no connection with these guys) and you'll see all the exotic scenery, antics, fish porn, and fishing zealotry that you could ask for.",1172880000,7,1523,4.670411985018727
8090851,5,B000BPYKBO,"After spending over two decades exploring the Bahamas, I had yet to find a film I could recommend to my clients and angling friends that captured the essence of the Bahamian Islands. My search is over. ""In Search of a Rising Tide"" brings something to the screen that is very special, and that until now, has been all but unexplored on film: the culture of bonefishing. One can experience the truly unique culture of Andros and the guides who pole its' waters - while seeing some serious world-class fishing at the same time.

I heartily recommend this film for anyone who has always wanted to experience the ultimate bonefishing getaway - as well as the seasoned flats fisherman who wants to relive (on demand!) the rare moments they reminisce about all year long. It's the next best thing to being there!",1131321600,6,805,4.709219858156028
8090852,5,B000BPYKBO,"Fly fishing may have a new savior. Mr. Howard and his fellow
filmmakers are clearly not doing business as usual. This is as good as
I've found. This short film is a gem that takes the magic of Bahamas
bonefishing and manages to get it all on screen.

  The magic of the saltwater flats is often lost in television and mass
produced ""fishing videos"" because a true filmmaker is not within miles
of the action. Native guides usually take a back seat to some flown-in
hosts...and shots are anything but artful or cinematic. But, as a
lifelong fly fisherman I have willingly put up with this for years,
because even a fleeting glimpse of the flats was enough to get my blood
pumping. Now, it seems, I don't have to settle!...WE don't have to
settle! They did what great sports films should always do: Take you
away on a journey. Enjoy. I did!
