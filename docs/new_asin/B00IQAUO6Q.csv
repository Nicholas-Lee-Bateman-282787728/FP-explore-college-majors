6286427,3,B00IQAUO6Q,"Destoroyah gives the audience one of Toho's weirder beasties--it begins as a bunch of smaller critters (in one scene they move around like pull toys and fall over when shelled) who combine to make a bigger beastie who becomes a still bigger beastie (the ""adult"") who can become a bunch of smaller critters--and all of this is somehow the outgrowth (should that be in the plural?) of the oxygen destroyer from the first movie (it isn't ""micro-oxygen""  because the scientist says, ""I know micro-oxygen; micro-oxygen doesn't have that kind of power"").  Godzilla himself looks great--he's overheating by this point, and his chest glows red.  The ""little one"" (who has somehow grown up) ""isn't a killer,"" we are told; perhaps he eats rice or bamboo.  There are some impressive explosions; there's a suspenseful scene in which one of the heroines is trying to hide in a car from one of the mini-Destoroyas; there's some sentiment at the very end.

6286445,5,B00IQAUO6Q,"Godzilla Vs, Destoroyah is one of my all time favorite Godzilla movies. It gets into Godzilla's origins which is interesting. I had to watch it several times to notice all of the subtle complexities of the story and tie it in with the original Godzilla movie.

I'm not sure if I've seen Godzilla Vs. Megaguirus but it comes with this set.

Another favorite of mine is Godzilla 2000.

If you haven't seen ""Destroyah"" before and you're a G-fan, then prepare yourself. It's not a happy story. MEGAGUIRUS has some nifty effects and good battles to go with all the human drama. Overall these two titles earn a solid 4 STARS from this lifelong G-fan.

GODZILLA vs. DESTROYAH... The last of the controversial 90's/Heisei films takes us out of the 20th century with a bang (and a whimper).
THE STORY (contains spoilers): Godzilla's nuclear power is out of control; he's literally burning from the inside out. And unless mankind can figure out a way to cool the Big Guy down he'll explode - vaporizing half our planet in the process. At the same time, a brash scientist reveals that he's essentially duplicated the micro-oxygen technology developed by Dr. Serizawa (the tortured doc with the eye patch from the 1954 G-film). This new announcement coincides with the discovery of ultra-ancient lifeforms found in the strata beneath Tokyo Bay. These Precambrian crustaceans have been genetically altered by the residue left from the detonation of the original Oxygen Destroyer device that killed the first Godzilla. But unbeknownst to anyone, these creatures are alive - and still evolving - and have an deadly agenda of their own. Meanwhile, Godzilla's ""son"" has continued to grow & mutate further from the events in the previous film (GODZILLA vs. SPACE GODZILLA), and the 'tiny' guy, now referred to as Godzilla Junior, is almost half Godzilla's size. Will he soon become a threat equal to dear old dad? How do all these threads tie together?? Pick up a copy of GvD and see for yourself!

THOUGHTS (contains spoilers): The crew at Toho intended to end their 90's series by pulling out all the stops and giving us something truly spectacular. The creative F/X are quite memorable. Unfortunately they're also quite uneven in this film. Terrific stuff like the amazing look of a burning/melting Godzilla are offset by some lackluster miniatures and really sloppy execution of said props (certain shots of the Destroyah crabs and Junior laughably resemble those old vibrating electronic football figures. *SHUDDER*). The optical stuff thankfully is stellar, with Godzilla & Destroyah unleashing some devastating beam weapons that truly impress. There is minimal use of CGI, but why didn't they use this technology to erase all the telltale wires on the fighter jets & Destroyah himself ?? It's frustrating, but it is what it is. On the plus side is an excellent ""swan song"" film score from lifelong Godzilla composer, Akira Ifukube, that's equal parts bombastic and touching. Speaking of which... the ending of this picture, (if you're a big fan of Godzilla), may well leave you in tears. It's hard to watch the climax without getting pretty choked up. It does me, which is why I rarely screen this particular G-film. 4 STARS

GODZILLA vs. MEGAGUIRUS...
THE STORY (contains spoilers): The new ""Millennium series"" Godzilla, first introduced in GODZILLA 2000, remains a threat to mankind - but  scientists have figured out an original solution to his rampages: a new weapon (a monstrous, telescope-looking piece of tech nicknamed Dimension Tide) that can create a miniature black hole. They intend to zap Godzilla with it and de-materialize him at the atomic level. A complication occurs during a test of the black hole gun when small ripples in time & space are created as a side effect, but the scientists in charge are convinced that the anomaly will quickly dissipate with no ill effects. But later that night a massive dragonfly slips thru undetected from our prehistoric past - just before the distortion stabilizes - and lays eggs here, in our time. These begin hatching quickly, and the unsuspecting citizens of Tokyo turn out to be perfect-sized tasty snacks for the ravenous larvae. Soon, the Japanese government is caught in a real quandary...which is the lesser of two evils now: one big radioactive dinosaur OR hundreds of Cessna-sized man-munching dragonflies AND their battleship-sized queen?!?!?

THOUGHTS: A fun and exciting entry in the third wave of Japan-produced G-films. It's not perfect, no Godzilla film really is, but this one has lots of interesting ideas, some terrific monster action and a nifty new movie score to delight the ears. Human acting is the usual soap opera-level fluff, but even that's given a small shot in the arm, in the form of the return of classic G-film actress Kumi Mizuno, playing the Dimension Tide project's head honcho. The suitmation & optical effects here are solid and imaginative. The only wonky aspect is that the big bag guy (err... bad girl) doesn't have four wings as a proper dragonfly should, and they rarely flap; she just appears to float in most scenes. Some cool CGI lets her flap them at blurry sonic speeds, causing much devastation in certain scenes, but frankly this should have been the look for her in flight all of the time, instead of selectively. (A budget-related choice, I am guessing.) It drags an otherwise well-rounded F/X effort down a few notches. The other F/X aspects look pretty good and there's some clever fight choreography during the confrontations between the Megaguirus queen and our big green hero. The grand finale battle will have G-fans pumping their fists, clapping & cheering. (And stay tuned until after the end credits!) 4 STARS

THE BLU-RAY: This 2-disc hi-def release from Sony is solid. Excellent video portion on both of these films, with only minimal dirt, artifiacting, pixelation and crush (video noise). The audio portion for both features is equally strong & level, for the original Japanese language track as well as the English dub. Only extras, as with most of these two-fers from Sony, is the inclusion of the original Japanese trailers (subtitled in English).",1476057600,,6244,5.14679802955665

6286476,2,B00IQAUO6Q,"Godzilla vs Destroyer---or however they spell it---is simply a movie I cannot like very much at all. It should have been much more, but like the bulk of the Heisei series, it is slavishly derivative (think Cameron's Aliens, in one sequence, with a little Jurassic Park thrown in), humorless and gloomy. By the time Space Godzilla came about, I was as tired of Miki Saegusa as Robinson Crusoe was sick of eating coconuts. Whiny, frail and darned near useless, she makes me wince more here than in any movie except Space G.
The entire cast goes on and on about the evils of nuclear this and that, yet seem oddly smug and self-satisfied when one of their own scientists come up with something more dangerous: micro oxygen.  Over and over, Doc Serizawa is touted as a ""great scientist"" who in actuality did nothing more than come up with a method to dissolve fish quickly. By the time of Destroyer, no one seems to give a hoot that the oxygen destroyer was a dud (Godzilla still exists) and its use has given rise to a really nasty monster only Godzilla has a hope of eliminating. Not much, if anything, is said of this, because before anyone has a chance, the credits roll.
The Showa  series did a lot of complaining about evil nuclear energy, though to director Honda's credit, he didn't do much in the way of finger pointing. What kills me is that the Heisei and Millennium series showed the Japanese dabbling over and over again with (thankfully incredibly absurd) technology that was as dangerous and foolish as the Manhattan Project times ten. I'm thinking of Biollante's ""anti- nuclear bacteria,"" the same film's ""thunder control system""----and the ""Dimension Tide"" project at the center of ""Megaguirus."" After that one, I thought, ""ain't these guys ever gonna stop fooling around with bad science? It never turns out well!"" It would seem Japan is just lousy with people in every nook and cranny who are just educated enough to get themselves into very serious trouble. Damn good thing Godzilla's around to get them out of their collective frying pan.
I believe this is why the Heisei movies weren't as well received as they could have been, at home and abroad, and not just for the reasons stated above. Let's face it---this series simply took itself far too seriously. Everyone was in danger---except for the government and military honchos socked away safely underground, watching the goings-on in the glow of a wide array of JumboTron screens. You could count on it from the get-go, as far back as The Return of Godzilla in 1984 and nothing new ever happened. There was always the ""kill/study Godzilla"" debate, and another goofy robot or plane waiting in the wings whereby those who wished to kill Godzilla could try their hand. Those who wished to study him always has Miki to try controlling the beast with her rather wanting version of The Force---and it never worked.
Formulaic, in short, with none of the fun Honda and Shinichi Sekizawa put into their films. Too many people think Godzilla vs Megalon was the worst Godzilla film ever made. Others say it's Godzilla's Revenge. My money is on these two.
I ordered these because it's usually easier to watch these groaners in Japanese. But for me, it simply wasn't so. I was bored, and put in King Kong vs Godzilla instead. Much better.",1448496000,,3295,4.758741258741258

6286487,5,B00IQAUO6Q,"Just  finished watching ""Godzilla vs Destoroyah"" and ""Godzilla vs Megaguirus"" released by Toho Studios.
Jeff H. also watched ""Godzilla vs Destoroyah"" with me.
Junior, a.k.a. Baby Godzilla has bee MIA for a while now.  A concerned telepath has spent countless years looking for the baby monster out of a sense of responsiblity.
She gets sidetracked when Godzilla resurfaces and poses a threat far graver than just demolishing Tokyo for grins and giggles.  Godzilla has now become a living nuclear reactor that is about to melt down.  If he does, then it's the entire Earth that's going to be kissed goodby this time.
Enter Destoroyah.  Each battle between these two monsters pushes Godzilla to brink of meltdown.
What is also interesting about this particular Godzilla movie is that a same-sex [lesbian] relationship is hinted at with direct openess, but never spoke of - just like the gay relationship hinted at in Godzilla - Toyko S.O.S.
There is also a rather interesting twist at the end of this movie that suggests new Godzillas are a result of nuclear explosions.
Now ""Godzilla vs Megaguirus"" is intriguing because its the first, and so far only time, an artifically created black hole weapon - Dimension TIde - has been created in an attempt to capture and destroy Godzilla once and for all.
The CGI special effects that were created for the Dimension Tide weapon are spectular and realistically impressive.
Though a test run of Dimension Tide creates Megaguirus and it's a deadly show down between the two monsters and, opps, wouldn't you know it, the Dimension TIde space satellite - yes, we must keep such a deadly weapon in Earth orbit in order to better position it when a monster appears - begins to deorbit.
There is a rather funny, at least in my opinion, encounter between two people who, by the movie's end, still haven't learned why its such a bad idea to keep deadly secrets.
Both Godzilla movies are Highly Recommended!

6286532,5,B00IQAUO6Q,"G vs Destroyah is arguably one of the best if not the best of all the classic Toho Godzilla movies. Certainly the best of the modern ones. G vs Megagurius is a fairly straight up unremarkable entry in the series. not awful. good Kaiju fun. but nowhere near the over the top tear jerking awesome of Destroyah. 5 stars for Destroyah, 3 for Megs.

Megagurius suffers a bit from early CGI, a non standard world, and some over the top human characters. (including the dumbest kid ever seen in a Godzilla movie since Godzilla's Revenge's Kenny.) They essentially re-use much of these same character roles later in Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla to much better effect.

Destroyah is the must see Godzilla movie. It is the Godzilla dies movie. The one where Toho clears the decks to allow Hollywood to make the 1998 Mathew Broderick Giant Lizard movie. It closes out the interconnected Heisei era that has built a world begining with 1985's Godzilla Returns and 1986's Godzilla vs Biolante. It ties everything up well, with tension and action. The Destroyah itself works on many levels allowing it to mimic everything from Science/CSI to Alien Tight Corridor horror up to the best brutal Kaiju slugfest they ever filmed.

1954's Gojira is and will always be the best Godzilla movie. Destroyah is the #2.",1402876800,,1295,4.850678733031674

6286547,5,B00IQAUO6Q,"5 stars for the DVD set. I am glad they included the B Roll at the end of Godzilla vs Destroyah.
The previous version had bad dubbing and cut out the end credits.

Picture and sound are great and you get the option of Japanese dialogue. This is key for me when I made the decision to purchase these.

Now for the actual movies...

5 stars for Godzilla vs Destroyah.
This movie was the perfect curtain call for the Heisei series. Godzilla is facing meltdown and the clock is ticking for the Japanese to figure a way of preventing Godzilla from taking out the whole planet when he goes into meltdown mode.
Destroyah show up as a result of reconfiguring the original weapon that killed him in 1954.
He has multiple forms, small crablike forms, a large crablike form, flying form and final form. His final form is awesome. He truly is a menacing looking creature. The fight between Godzilla and final form Destroyah is brutal and well done.
I like the light saber horn weapon Destroyah sports.
Godzilla junior looks great and in no way looks cartoony. He is older and the sculpt for the suite looks great.
The end sequence where Godzilla dies is the the best death sequence for a monster I have ever seen.
The musical score called Requiem is beautifully done.
When all is quiet, and the think they are truly rid of Godzilla......
They kept the b roll this time and it shows scenes from Godzilla from 84 to 95.

3 stars for Godzilla x Mehaguirus

This movie would get serious and then get downright silly. There was some eyecandy and some lame parts.
I liked the new look of the millennium Godzilla. The scene where the heroine fires a transmitter on him looked cool.
Godzilla looked fierce and was a force to reckon with. Certain parts just didn't look well and came across as silly.
When he shakes his head quickly left to right and the ridiculous belly flop on Megaguirus.
Megaguirus wasn't really an innovative looking creature. He looked like a variation of Battora/Battra.
Some of the special effects looked great and some looked rushed. You could see strings in a few scenes. No excuse for that for movies that are newer. This isn't the 70's.
This movie had an excellent score.
I am more of a fan of the Heisei series than the millennium series.
With that said, this set is a must for Godzilla fans.
I strongly recommend.",1401062400,,2323,4.547846889952153
6286548,5,B00IQAUO6Q,"Godzilla vs Destroyah is my favorite Godzilla film. He just looked absolutely phenomenal in the movie. Not a fan of Godzilla 2000 style and the ""Dimensional Tide"" weapon in the movie is ridiculous. A black hole (even a microscopic one) would do so much damage to the Earth...",1400976000,,275,4.75
6286549,3,B00IQAUO6Q,"Okay, so major fans like me have been watching these Blu-Rays closely, excited to see the Japanese versions of the films in the U.S. home video market.  In a certain interview with Sci-Fi Japan [...], a Sony spokesperson claimed the English subtitles would be based on the Japanese audio tracks.

This is only partially true.

The subtitles for Godzilla vs. Megaguirus are ""Dubtitles,"" subtitles that correspond to the English dub instead of the Japanese audio like Sony claimed.

Godzilla vs. Destroyah, on the other hand, have subtitles that translate the Japanese audio.

I'm guessing that if subtitles already existed for a previous release, Sony simply opted to use those.  This could mean the Tokyo S.O.S. Blu-Ray is also be dubtitled, as would a potential Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah Blu-Ray release.

This is a shame, as the dub for Megaguirus is not a very accurate translation, with wooden and often painful dialogue.  Sadly, this is the best version of the movie that exists in the U.S.",1400630400,,1001,5.024242424242424

6286551,5,B00IQAUO6Q,"This set contains high-quality transfers of the last of the Heisei series (90s) Godzillas and the second of the Millennium series (2000s).  There are only trailers for extras, but the movies look and sound great, and you can't beat the low price.  The films themselves have a lot to recommend them.  Destroya is a fitting swan song for that part of Godzilla's career (You do know there's more than one Godzilla, don't you?) and has the best special effects of that run.  Megaguirus has some great ideas, interesting characters and story elements, and some scenes (like riding Godzilla's back as he swims) that will always stick with me.  It's not my favorite of the Millennium stories (GMK is -- and that needs a blu ray), but there are definitely parts of it that influenced my own work when I wrote DAIKAIJU ATTACK.

If you're a Godzilla fan, both of these fans are definitely worth checking out.",1400457600,9,898,4.7243589743589745
6286552,5,B00IQAUO6Q,"Finally a great release of Godzilla vs Destoroyah. Godzilla vs Megaguirus already had a pretty good release. As many people have said, I don't know why they skipped over Godzilla 2000. I like Godzilla 2000. Hopefully they will release the rest of the millennium series. This release is like the other Godzilla blu-ray two-fers. It has great picture and sound with Optional Japanese and English subtitles. Each movie is on it's own disc and not much in the way of extras. Just like the cars from the early 60's, Godzilla's tail fins hit their all time high during Godzilla 2000 and Godzilla vs Megaguirus. I don't watch Godzilla vs Megaguirus much, but it is one of my son's favorites. I believe Godzilla vs destoroyah was the last film to feature new music from classic Godzilla composer Akira Ifukube. Plus it has the woman from the first Godzilla in it. Definitely worth getting.",1400112000,10,881,4.802631578947368
6286553,4,B00IQAUO6Q,"Sony's series of Toho Godzilla Blu-ray double features tended to give us films paired chronologically, yet this release skipped the film that goes between these two.  Giving us the last film of the Heisei series and the second film of the Millennium series seems like a move that's going to annoy more than a few fans.

That aside, these films look fantastic.  Would like to have seen the English soundtrack given stereo treatment, or maybe a few more goodies in the bonus features department, but those are small complaints.  Hopefully Sony will release more of their Toho catalog on Blu-ray, including the complete REBIRTH OF MOTHRA trilogy.",1399852800,8,643,4.981308411214953

My only minor complaint is Destoroyah not being 5.1, but its not really a big issue. It still sounds great. We get both the dub and the Japanese audio, which is a huge plus. Also, the packaging is surprisingly nice, with cool disc art and art on the inside cover. We also get the films on seperate discs.

Godzilla vs. Destroya is the last film of the Heisei era Godzilla films and sets the tone for the coming Millenium era. By that it means we see a slightly more formidable Godzilla.

Godzilla vs. Megaguirus is the second of the Millennium series (after Godzilla 2000 which is only sold as a stand-alone) and features a newly designed Godzilla and a focus on the ""science"" of Godzilla.

These films are great parts of the Toho Godzilla movies, which are arguably the only true Godzilla movies.
