Their families even sign a contract with each other to confirm their promise to one another. But shortly afterwards, Jung Sook's family disappears in the middle of the night due to financial problems.

Eighteen years later and Jung Sook, a feisty and hopeless romantic, falls in love at first sight with a man wearing traditional clothing. She soon finds out that the man she is arranged to marry is in fact the same man she fell in love with.

Jung Sook has always been unsure what she wants in life. After meeting Hyuk Joon, she decides she wants nothing more than to be a devoted and caring wife. After much thought, the two end up getting married, but it's not going to be an easy marriage. The two are complete opposites and are constantly clashing over every little thing. Plus, Kwon Hyuk Joon comes from a very traditional family. He will soon become the next head of the family, which comes with many responsibilities. Being Kwon Hyuk's wife, Jung Sook must learn the traditional ways of doing things, such as cooking the old fashioned way, trying to impress the strict and narrow-minded elders, learning traditional customs/manners/history of family, and there is even the added pressure of producing an heir. While Jung Sook is learning the ins and outs of traditional life, Kwon Hyuk is working hard as a prosecutor on a risky case that involves gangsters. The case puts both Kwon Hyuk and Jung Sook in danger. Can these two overcome all their obstacles and become a loving married couple?

This isn't one of my favorite Korean dramas, but it was an alright romantic comedy. It has lots of comedy and sincerity and even some action. It can be pretty entertaining. I recommend giving it a try. (16 episodes) (Also known as, ""Sweet 18."")",1390089600,,1834,4.707165109034268
