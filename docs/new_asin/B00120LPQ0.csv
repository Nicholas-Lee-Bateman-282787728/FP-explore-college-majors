3071053,3,B00120LPQ0,"WWE Should Strongly Consider Leaving Out The Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania And Soon To Be Released On An Anthology Summerslam Matches Out Of This Collection.  For One Thing These Matches Are on The PPV DVDs Already.  And The Wrestlemania 17 Match Is On Many Other Non-PPV DVDs.  And Coming Back To The Anthologies, Since They Are Available In Volumes.  I Don't Think Many People Would Have A Hard Time Obtaining Those Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania And Soon Summerslam Matches.  So If Somehow WWE Sees This PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE THOSE MATCHES and include others not currently available on DVD, and then this will truly be an electrifying collection !!!!!",1206576000,,647,5.009345794392523
3071054,5,B00120LPQ0,"I thought that it was about time they released a DVD set with The Rock. The most electrifying man in sports entertainment today. He has been out of the ring for years. This will definitely have a lot of his great matches with his opponents such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, Mick Foley, Chris Benoit, Hulk Hogan, Kurt Angle, among others. I will upgrade this review as soon as I find out what this set will feature. Just by the looks of it, there are already some jabronis out there who don't understand this review. I read a different review from somebody who thinks that The Rock should be forgotten. I don't believe that statement because The Rock was smart enough to know when it was time to step down. Why would The Rock want to acomplish the same goals over and over again. Triple H many times has said that he had nothing left to prove but you still see him winning the same world title time after time again. The Rock has not forgotten about the wrestling business, he has just been making movies the last few years, where he is making millions and millions at the box office. At least The Rock does not do what ""Stone Cold Steve Austin"" does, show up to do a short stint, hog up somebody elses credit, puts a guy out with a Stone Cold Stunner without wrestling in a match and leaves back to the rat hole from whence he came from. Many reviewers won't like this statement but it is true. If you smell-la-la-la-la-laooooowww, what The Rock is cookin.",1205884800,2,1465,4.389705882352941

3071077,4,B00120LPQ0,"This 3 DVD set of 'The Rock' features wrap-around segments in between his matches with a generic commentator quickly explaining the roots and beginnings of his career progressing along with the growth of his character and his rising status in the World Wrestling Federation.

The wrap-around segments are quick and do not go into much depth or detail. It also does not feature any wrestler interviews, and no involvement from 'The Rock' himself.  There's a large selection of matches although a few opponents are repeated several times(not necessarily a bad thing).

And of course you get a nice selection of Rock's famous and charismatic promo's that helped build his popularity. Overall this is a nice set more for the matches than an in-depth look at his life or career. Worth picking up if you can find it at a good bargain price.",1417392000,2,834,4.859154929577465

3071087,4,B00120LPQ0,This set takes you through The Rock's WWE career but only gives an overview of it. It lacks a lot of the great moments in his career. It brings you along the great matches but doesn't go in depth with why those matches were some of the greatest. Plus it has a pocket on the inside where a booklet usually is and there wasn't one even though I bought it new. So I give this an overall score of 4 stars.,1361404800,,401,3.962962962962963

3071091,3,B00120LPQ0,"I recently bought this 3 disc DVD set. The Rock is agreat wrestler & has had many classic matches. This DVD set does offer some of those matches. You get 19 matches + bonus extras with this. It's got some entertainment value to it. It's a overall cool set. Disc 1 starts off with a 1997 match against HHH (WWE(f) Intercontinental Championship match. And works it's way through some matches from '98 into '99. The last match on disc 1 is The Rock vs Stone Cold for the WWE(f) Championship belt. Disc 2 starts off with a steel cage match between Rock & HHH. And ends with a Undisputed Championship match against. Chris Jericho. Disc 3 starts off with Wrestlemania X8's match between The Rock & Hulk Hogan. And end with a Wrestlmania XIX match against Stone Cold. Don't get me wrong it's worth getting, especially for under $10.00. I paid $4.00....The only real gripe I have with this DVD set is it felt in some way a bit repetetive. The Rock wrestles HHH 4 times,Mankind 3 times + once tag teaming with Mankind vs Undertaker & Big Show. Not to say that those matches were/are bad. But it just kinda makes it feel like a bit of the same. I would recommend this DVD set to any Rock,WWF,WWE,WCW fan.",1354838400,2,1194,4.431818181818182

3071094,3,B00120LPQ0,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was the most electrifying man in sports entertainment (and these days claims ""ALL of entertainment"") and you can watch many of his best matches and most memorable interviews and one-liners in this three-disc set that was released in 2008. With his recent return to the WWE, this is a great time for a refresher course in the history of The Rock.

This is one of those WWE sets where story is told in between matches instead of altogether in one documentary that you can sit and watch at once. What I find difficult about this is that people don't always have time to sit and watch this set for NINE hours in order to see the entire story. I much prefer the sets where you can watch the story all at once and then work on the matches over time. Plus there is an impartial narrator piecing the story together with soundbites from The Rock and NO interviews with the man himself talking about his past and how it felt at the time besides being the character.

The Rock wasn't always The Rock though, he started out as Rocky, paying tribute to his family lineage in wrestling from his grandfather, Rocky Maivia and his father, Rocky Johnson. He started out as a good guy, but didn't really have a concrete identity and fans turned on his one-dimensional nature. Within months people began to hate him and that's where The Rock was truly born. He took on the mic, spoke in third person, and started inventing catch phrases. He joined a stable, the Nation of Domination where he took over and kicked the leader out and insisted people call him ""ruler"". He became popular and eventually got out of the Nation of Domination. People began to love him and even after his heel turn becoming the Corporate Champion, people couldn't resist cheering for The Rock.

There was an epic extended feud with Mankind (with SEVERAL matches included in this set), icon vs icon against Stone Cold Steve Austin, feuds with Triple H on and off, one of my favorite storylines -- the Rock `N Sock connection, the infamous moment of facing Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania, and tons of other rivalries, but what is undeniable is The Rock's connection to the fans. He arches an eyebrow and they go nuts. He sticks his nose in the air and the arena goes silent so he can announce the name of the city he has FINALLY come back to. We can't get enough of what The Rock is cookin' and any silence over a few seconds prompts chanting of the Great One's name. He has tons of nicknames -- The Rock, The Great One, The People's Champion, The most Electrifiying Man in all of (Sports) Entertainment.

Few WWE Superstars have been able to exercise his level of complete captivation over his audience. His commitment and creativity and addictive one-liners are the reason he was able to become so popular and then bridge over into the film industry. He has been in several movies, some bad, some good enough, and one horrible film with him wearing a fairy costume that I still haven't been able to wipe completely from my memory. Sure, some fans were upset feeling like he deserted the WWE, but I haven't seen anyone who isn't thrilled to have him back to host this year's WrestleMania, complete with digs against the current most popular WWE Superstar, John Cena.

Matches in this set include:

Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs Rocky Maivia - WWE Intercontinental Championship Match - RAW 1997
Owen Hart vs The Rock - WWE Intercontinental Championship Match - RAW 1998
Triple H vs The Rock - King of the Ring Quarterfinal Match - RAW 1998
Mankind vs The Rock - WWE Championship Match Final Round - Survivor Series 1998
Mankind vs The Rock - Last Man Standing Match for WWE Championship - St. Valentine's Day Massacre 1999
Mankind vs The Rock - Ladder Match for WWE Championship - RAW 1999
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock - WWE Championship Match - Wrestlemania XV 1999
The Rock vs Triple H - Steel Cage Match - RAW 1999
The Rock & Mankind vs Undertaker & Big Show - WWE Tag Team Championship Match - RAW 1999
The Rock vs Kane - No Holds Barred Match - Smackdown 1999
Triple H vs The Rock - WWE Championship Match - Backlash 2000
The Rock vs Shane McMahon - Steel Cage Match for WWE Championship - RAW 2000
Kurt Angle vs The Rock - WWE Championship Match - No Way Out 2001
Booker T vs The Rock - WWE Championship Match - Summerslam 2001
Chris Jericho vs The Rock - WWE Undisputed Championship Match - Royal Rumble 2002
The Rock vs Hollywood Hulk Hogan - Wrestlemania X8 2002
Kurt Angle vs Undertaker vs The Rock - Triple Threat Match for WWE Undisputed Championship - Vengeance 2002
The Rock vs Eddie Guerrero - RAW 2002
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock - Wrestlemania XIX 2003

As time goes on, the matches get better and better, especially those with Mankind, Triple H, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Hogan match is epic and was an instant classic when it occurred as the most iconic wrestler ever met the most electrifying wrestler ever and both men gave each other respect afterward in a cool way. The give and take and back and forth is one of the most entertaining matches I've seen.

Extras:

16 of The Rock's best interview segments are featured here including ""Billy's prayer to God"", ""The Big Slow"", ""My Name is Kane"", ""Doughnuts"", ""Hermie"", ""Thomas Jefferson Sucka"", ""The People's Strudel"", ""Great Balls of Fire"", ""Copacabana"", ""The Charleston"", ""The Superhero"", ""Miami Dolphins"", and more! The segment of one-liners is nine minutes long (and can be previewed on Youtube since I shared it on the Haunted Flower Facebook page recently). Both comedy segments are amazingly entertaining and more fun than most of his matches if I'm being perfectly honest.",1301443200,2,5644,4.602385685884692
3071095,3,B00120LPQ0,"I ordered this DVD set with a lot of high hopes.  The Rock is one of my favorite superstars of all time, and one of the major reasons why I got back into wrestling in the late 90's.  Overall, I have to say I'm not that impressed by what we are given here.

I won't bother going into detail on the matches since there are dozens of other reviews that can tell you all about them.  I will, however, complain about the match choice.  There's no less than 4 Rock vs. HHH matches on this disc, and the Rock n Sock Connection match they chose was a one-sided affair where UT leaves and it's a handicap match.  I know you're a little more limited in terms of Rock n Sock matches, but that was the best you could find?

The Rock's early career is done rather piecemeal.  There is little mention of his time in the Nation of Domination, and only a tiny bit of time dedicated to his reign as the Corporate Champion.  There is a lot of stuff from his later career, post 2000.  I would much rather have had more time dedicated to the early and middle sections of his career where he was still coming up through the ranks.

Finally, and this is the biggest problem with the DVD set - The Rock doesn't speak.  It's not only him speaking about his own career, like telling his own story, but it's also a problem that the WWE decided not to show a lot of his classic promos from the time.  They mention on the discs that the Rock's birthday party (the one thrown by Mankind) was the highest rated TV segment in all of RAW history, and yet they only talk about it and show stills.  They show little cuts of more important promos in the documentary part, but never the whole thing.  Some of them are featured on the extras segment of disc three, but even there, only about eight of the twenty are pre-2000.  There are so many important, classic moments that are missing from this set that it's truly a shame.

The wrestling's pretty good, the Rock is the Rock, but this collection lacks that truly special stuff that it needs to be more than average.",1297728000,2,2032,4.263707571801566
3071102,5,B00120LPQ0,"Oh man....!!!! Wow!!!! Wow!!!! Wow!!!!!!!!!!! I still can't find a reason for, why this great superstar is not being selected in to the WWE Hall of Fame!!!",1295740800,,155,4.777777777777778
3071103,4,B00120LPQ0,I just like the rock so I got this. Lot of good matches and interviews.,1278028800,,71,3.8
3071104,4,B00120LPQ0,"Let me tell you, I'm a huge pro wrestling fan. So much, I used my Christmas list last year to start my DVD collection. I'm a fan of technical wrestlers, like Bret Hart, Mr. Perfect, Ted Dibiase, and I guess I'll throw in Ricky Steamboat. (Come to think of it, where are my Steamboat and Dibiase DVDs?) But if I had to choose one wrestler who was the absolute total package, and nearly perfect, it's The Rock. He had agility, talent, charisma, mic skills, and he could easily bring the crowd to his side, even when he was telling Canadians to kiss his ass. So it was only natural he would have his own DVD. And how is it? It's overall a nice package, but it's missing a bit.

First, the packaging is nice. The cover stands out, the inner covers look great, and the disks feature him delivering a Rock Bottom to, I believe, Owen Hart, Kane, and Hogan. It's much better than the pink black and white vomit that's splattered all over the Bret Hart disks.

The presentation is what you'd expect. The menus show video clips of The Rock and play his theme song. The between match videos explain where his feuds were going are nice and epic, but you don't hear a whole lot from the man behind The Rock. You hear how he got his start, but that's not really enough to me. Also, why the hell is Steve Austin's signature taunt censored? I mean, it's for private viewing, so why does it matter?

Now let's get to the extras first before the real matches. It's a collection of a good amount of his hilarious promos. Watch him say things about Vince's daughter that should have got him fired. Hear him call Goldust what we always think when he crosses our mind. From Billy's Prayer to God to his abuse of a camera man to his abuse of an interviewer to his abuse of two police officers... Hell, just watch a half hour of him abusing people. I can't think of many promos that were missed. His promo with the camera man is a testament to how well he could play to the crowd.

But the matches need work. You get his Wrestlemania XV and XIX matches with Steve Austin, some matches with Kurt Angle, (including their fantastic Triple Threat match with 'Taker.) But there's one that really angers me, but I won't take off for it because it's my own preference: His match with Chris Jericho. I just didn't want to be reminded of him on this DVD, and the match, in my opinion, isn't that spectacular. But the number one complaint is a certain match is missing. A certain match with one Mick Foley; Mankind. Yeah, they show footage from his... Spectacular match with Foley, but the match isn't there. Why!? It's one of his number one matches, so why did they have to leave it out? Maybe because it's less than The Rock's most flattering matches. He basically tortures him for half an hour. It's more for Foley fans, but that's no excuse.

All in all, there are some issues, but it really comes together in a nice collection of the most electrifying jabroni-beatin', pie-eatin', trail-blazin', eyebrow-raisin' peoples champ: The Rock.",1263340800,,3007,4.469945355191257

The Rock was the first ever 3rd generation superstar and the first superstar to ever win the WWE championship 7 times. The Rock could possibably be the most charasmatic & entertaining superstar of all time.

As far as for the DVD set goes, you will hear nothing from The Rock whatsoever. The narration is done by someone else but not by The Rock. You will also get nothing from other superstars either. The same as Tombstone: History of the Undertaker. The narrator goes through and discuss The Rock's Samoan heritage, his rise to fame and popularity, WWE title reigns, the connection with the fans and the hatred from the fans, and also feuds with Mankind, Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and others.

DISC 1
RAW 2.13.97
Intercontinental Title
Vs. Hunter Hearst Hemsley - The match told a pretty good inring story. It went at a good pace and the ending worked in very well. 4/5

RAW 4.6.98
Intercontinental Title
Vs. Owen Hart - This match started out pretty good. It was getting better as it progressed but the disqualification by Chyna is what killed it. 3.75/5

RAW 6.22.98
King of the Ring Quarter-Finals Match
Vs. Triple H - Much better match then the previous match between these two. It was more of a physical match. Both men looked pretty good. A very good match up. 4.5/5

Survivor Series 11.15.98
WWE Title
Vs. Mankind - A very good match between these two here. Much better then their Rock Bottom encounter. Foley & Rock took some hard slams and hard shots on the outside. Foley even crashes through the announce table at one point in the match. A very good title match. 4.5/5

St. Valentine's Day Massacre 2.14.99
Last Man Standing Match/WWE Title
Vs. Mankind - Not a bloody and violent match as their I Quit match was but still a very physical contest. A lot of hard shots taken in this one. 4.75/5

RAW 2.15.99
Ladder Match/WWE Title
Vs. Mankind - These two just left off from where they were the night before. The only addition was the ladder. And to include a Rock Bottom through a table. And also a chokeslam from Big Show to Mankind from the top of the ladder. Another good bout from these two. 4.5/5

Wrestlemania XV
WWE Title
Vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - A very good first Wrestlemania encounter from these two. They added the no dq rule to the match which did add more to it. Pretty good match. Some good brawling on the outside and a good table spot. 4.75/5

DISC 2
RAW 7.5.99
Steel Cage Match
Vs. Triple H - Not a bloody cage bout but I felt this was an outstanding match. A very solid match up. 5/5

RAW 8.30.99
WWE Tag Team Titles
w/ Mankind Vs. Undertaker & Big Show - I wasn't really all too fond of this tag bout. Taker's role in this match seemed like he didn't care. And he would actually leave the match half way in. Leaving Big Show by himself. Then it became a 2 on 1 match. Not the best tag match in my view but watchable. 3.5/5

Smackdown 12.30.99
No Holds Barred
Vs. Kane - Not a lot of spots here. Except for a table spot and Kane being thrown off the stage. Still a good match to watch. 3.75/5

Backlash 4.30.00
WWE Title
Vs. Triple H - Another good battle from these two. But it did get a little annoying with Vince at ringside and Shane as the special referee. It had a very impactive double rock bottom through the announce table to HHH and Shane. Special appearence from Stone Cold in this one. 4.75/5

RAW 5.1.00
Steel Cage Match/WWE Title
Vs. Shane McMahon - I didn't really like this match at all. It was entertaining but all of the interfernce from the McMahons & Triple H was too cheesy for a steel cage match. But still a match to watch. 3.5/5

No Way Out 2.25.01
WWE Title
Vs. Kurt Angle - I feel that their No Mercy match is way better but this match is still good and very worth seeing. Very intense also. A very good battle for the title. 4.75/5

Summerslam 8.19.01
WCW Heavyweight Title
Vs. Booker T - This match was very high energetic. Phenomenal action in the ring and on the outside. Some good near falls and a great title match. Very good main event from Summerslam. 4.75/5

Royal Rumble 1.20.02
Undisputed Title
Vs. Chris Jericho - I felt that this match was on the same level as their Vengeance bout. But didn't feel better then their match from No Mercy. A solid match with a good table spot. 4.5/5

DISC 3
Wrestlemania X8
Vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - An outstanding match and great to see the crowd go crazy during this match. The match was back and forth all the way. One of the greatest matches in Wrestlemania history. Rock kicks out of the Hogan leg drop and comes back to give Hogan two Rock Bottoms and then a People's Elbow to beat Hogan in Hogan's second Wrestlemania lost. 5/5

Vengeance 7.21.02
Undisputed Title
Vs. Undertaker Vs. Kurt Angle - This was a tremendous triple threat bout. You nearly saw everything in this match. Awesome contest and a great showing from all three men. 5/5

RAW 7.22.02
Vs. Eddie Guerrero. - I enjoyed this match. Very entertaining and very good to watch. 4/5

Wrestlemania XIX
Vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - The match started very intense and fierce. It had some good brawling and hard shots on the outside. There were some very nice counters too. Rock works on Austin's leg briefly but not that whole much. The Rock hit some very hard impact Rock Bottoms to Austin in this one. Rock and Austin puts on a very good showing here. 4.5/5

The Extra's are very good. They consist of many of The Rock's promos and one liners. I recommend this set. The matches that were picked out were very good and they all delivered for the majority. Again, this is a set that I recommend picking up someday.",1233878400,15,5683,4.434740882917467

Also, the DVD has some of his greatest promos that entertained the masses through the years -- and I got the DVD at a great buy here at Amazon, so that was a plus too.

Overall this is a pretty good buy for any wrestling fan, it includes most of the Rocks most famous and most exciting matches (The Kurt Angle matches are a must). I gave this 3 stars because of all the WWF logo cover ups, I mean seriously why on earth the World Wildlife Foundation thinks it's necessary for the WWE to blur everything out is beyond me, at times it's ridiculous..I mean covering up the logo on the belt?

Not once do they sit down with The Great One.  The narrator just goes through his career from start to finish... discussing rivalries and battles etc...

It's all story..  We never hear what he was thinking about his matches.. How he got along with people backstage.. Problems he had on the road.. Nothin!!

So, it's good cause it has a tonne of his matches, but also kind of annoying because you never get his opinion on anything.. (Compared to the Triple H  - King of Kings or The Legacy of Stone Cold DVD where they talk about what they went through at certain stages).

Great backstage segments - excellent for a laugh..",1217203200,,728,4.395522388059701

However it would have been great in my books if they had added a few more things such as the time The Rock had to choose WWF or Alliance, he gave Vince a Rock Bottom and Shane Both a Rock Bottom and Peoples elbow.
Another thing was the match for wrestling supremacy WWF vs The Alliance tag match that saw Kurt Angle turn on the Alliance by distracting then immobilizing Stone Cold, before Rock finishing Austin off with a Rock Bottom.
Would had also been nice if they showed a bit more of the in fighting within the Nation of Domination, especially the Farooq/Rock rivalry.

I am sure not everyone has a bitter taste in their mouth because rock left. Then as someone else said match selection was subpar as was promo selection.

Regardless of how you feel about Dwayne Johnson & his relationship (or lack thereof) with the WWE for the past couple of years & his movie career, nobody can deny that The Rock was without one of the top superstars in WWE's past & has not only made an impact in wrestling (in the ring or on the microphone) & outside of it to the point where the word ""smackdown"" is now in the dictionary. This DVD set is a look back at his most of his career through an anthology of matches as The Rock didn't participate in this project so a voice over narrates you throughout the presentation.

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was back a few months into his debut year before he claimed the name ""The Rock"" & was still going by Rocky Maivia with us already getting a preview of things to come you already heard some ""Rocky Sucks!"" chants early.  Both men attempted to ground each other early as Rocky applied a leg scissors while Hunter applied the chinlock before a mistimed move by Rocky allowed Hunter to work over the shoulder while also beating down Rocky with a neckbreaker & suplex.  Rocky kept trying to mount some offense but Hunter was always one step ahead reversing & countering but Rocky refused to quit & kept kicking out before one mistake was made allowing the other to capitalize in a big way.
""RAW"" Feb. 97

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Owen Hart - This match went around 5 minutes & was too short to make anything of note past how this was just a backdrop to Owen's continued problems with D-Generation X around this time.
""RAW"" Apr. 98

vs. Triple H - This was the quarter final round in the King Of The Ring tournament that went back & forth between both men but served the purpose of pushing the growing conflict between DX & The Nation with members of both groups making their presence known during & after the match.
""RAW"" June 98

WWE Championship Match vs. Mankind - The finals of the ""Deadly Game"" tournament was best described by Jim Ross during the match when saying ""The Rock turned it up!"" because this was one of the times you saw The Rock get real aggressive, the moment he saw Mr. McMahon at ringside, against Mankind in the ring along with taking it outside the ring including various moments such as both men using chairs including Rock repeating slamming the chair onto the steel steps which were on top of Mankind & fighting on the announce tables. In the end, Vince McMahon gets his ""Corporate Champion"" using a finish that was complete ""deja vu.""
Survivor Series 98
[The Attitude Era]

Last Man Standing Match vs. WWE Champion Mankind - Mankind came into this match with a bad knee due to Rock attacking him earlier in the night as Mankind purposely turned his back on Rock allowing him to get the first punches in before he retaliated using the championship belt.  The fight went to the stage & technical area where both men took hard falls like a DDT through a table & suplex on the concrete as they made their way back to ringside where he had a few comedic moments from The Rock on commentary to Mankind's ""Mr. Elbow"" & later some ""SmackDown Hotel"" before they got more violent using whatever was near them such as the announce table, chair, and the steps including one moment where Rock dropped the stairs out of the ring onto Mankind's knee on the outside causing Lawler to comment, ""It's getting out of hand now.""  This match followed the formula of their previous matches in this feud (I Quit & Empty Arena) where it was a physical hardcore brawl where they beat each other until they had nothing left...literally.
St. Valentine's Day Massacre 99

Ladder Match vs. WWE Champion Mankind - After countless encounters over the previous months including such matches as ""I Quit"" & Last Man Standing & fights in an empty arena, this was their final encounter for the WWE Championship with the winner going into the title match against Steve Austin (who was also on commentary for this match. Mankind came into the match with a bad leg from the night before & they started this match on the floor with Rock targeting the legs right away by throwing Mankind into the steps legs first before slamming it into a chair multiple times. The ladder was brought into play by The Rock only for Mankind to start using it as a weapon by nailing it with a chair multiple times while Rock was trapped underneath but Rock continued to work over Mankind's bad knee to prevent him from climbing including hitting the ladder with a chair while his leg was wedged in-between & constantly hitting it with a chair whenever Mankind tried to climb. They took the fight to the outside brawling through the crowd before making their way back ringside & through the announce table but it was a ""big nasty"" presence that was the difference maker in the end.
""RAW"" Feb. 99
[Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

WWE Championship/No Disqualification Match vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - Austin came out in a t-shirt instead of his usual vest & took the fight to The Rock quickly as they brawled through the crowd to the stage area back to ringside with Austin dropping two elbow drops on Rock through the spanish table. A chair was put into play that caused the referee to accidentally get hit while Rock later used the chair to attack Austin all over his body before another referee was taken out. With Vince McMahon making his way to ringside along with the original special guest referee for this match, this was a match that lived up to the hype.
WrestleMania XV
[Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]

Steel Cage Match vs. Triple H - The only way to win this cage match was by escaping the cage as both men started delivering the hard hits early such as Rock with an impactful clothesline with Triple H later yanking Rock so hard off the top rope that his face hit the turnbuckle on the way down.  Chyna made her presence numerous times including handing Triple H a weapon to punch Rock & later preventing Rock from escaping while Rock fought just as dirty as they were with such tactics as using a low blow while also arm whipping Triple H off the top rope at one point.  Both men took the fight outside of the cage brawling on the outside including being rammed into the cage multiple times & fighting on the top of the cage where a chair was brought into play as well before this match was race to the end.  While this wasn't one of their more well known or classic encounters, it was one of their better forgotten matches.
""RAW"" July 99

w/Mankind vs. World Tag Team Champions Undertaker & Big Show - It was during this time that the Undertaker/Big Show alliance was all about Taker showing ""tough love"" to Show trying to turn him into an evil giant which we saw early on as Show was double teamed by Rock & Mankind while Undertaker did nothing but walk over to his corner before Show was able to overcome it to dominate Mankind with Taker getting his shots on the outside including throwing him into steps & brawling in the front row while Show slammed Foley onto the announce table he broke earlier in the night.  Undertaker for some reason decided to just walk off & leave Show to fight for himself until the odds just caught up to him with some additional help The Rock grabbed on the outside.  The match wasn't much but important as it was the birth of ""The Rock N' Sock Connection.""
""RAW"" Aug. 99

No Holds Barred Match vs. Kane - This match came about when Kane's girlfriend Tori accused The Rock of making a move on her as both men were intense from the start trading punches before quickly taking the fight to the ramp where a tombstone & Rock Bottom were attempted on the ramp before they took some hard hits like a fall off the ramp & later going through a table with a chair coming into play as well.  This match didn't go long but was physical from start to finish.
""SmackDown!"" Dec. 99

vs. WWE Champion Triple H - This was Rock's rematch from WrestleMania after Mr. McMahon screwed him out of the title that night but the odds were stacked against him with Shane McMahon as the referee, Stephanie & Mr. McMahon in Triple H's corner, and Steve Austin not being in The Rock's corner like he was advertised to be.  This was intense from the opening bell as they traded momentum with Triple H going for the pedigree early before being able to take advantage using the steps & announce table on the outside while clearly cheating in-front of Shane who didn't do anything about it while Mr. McMahon got his hits in as well throughout the match whenever The Rock would start to gain momentum.  The Rock caught a break when Triple H hurt his shoulder which The Rock targeted both in & outside the ring but Shane refused to count causing The Rock to take matters into his own hands before Mr. McMahon called for backup before some help finally came The Rock from people who had their own issues against Triple H & the McMahons.  This was the type of non-stop action main event expected from these two with all of the outside parties contributing to the match instead of distracting from it.
(Special Referee - Shane McMahon)
Backlash 00

WWE Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. Shane McMahon - This was setup the next night with the odds once again being stacked against The Rock as the McMahons & an injured Triple H were on the outside of the cage while Pat Patterson & Gerald Brisco were the special referees for the match.  The Rock was dominate early tossing Shane around the cage while the McMahons did whatever they could to help Shane with Vince trying to pull him out & Triple H spearing Rock with a stick & the referees working against Rock only for each attempt to backfire against Shane.  This was a fun match to watch with Shane taking some hard hits while the commentary was very humorous with Jim Ross constantly making jokes about Pat Patterson's ""personal life.""
""RAW"" May 00

vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle - This started off very intense early as both men went for their submission moves early before trading the same release belly to belly suplex back & forth with Rock delivering some hard hits like a superplex & a drilling DDT before someone who had an issue with both came out & took out his aggressions on both men.  The aggression picked up between both men even more with Angle applying the anklelock for close to a minute before both men kicked out of the others signature move while also on the receiving end of an exposed turnbuckle to the point where it took not one but two hard finishers to keep one man down for a three count.  This was an intense aggressive match from start to finish.
No Way Out 01
[The Rock: Just Bring It]

vs. WCW Champion Booker T - This was The Rock's return to PPV since his WrestleMania match months earlier. Both men traded momentum back & forth with Shane McMahon trying to get involved early on only for it to work against Booker as the fight went to to the floor & into the crowd at one point. Booker was able to gain the advantage & kept breaking the momentum whenever Rock tried to build it. Shane kept getting involved which finally caught up to him thanks to some people who's business he got involved in earlier in the night before Rock took care of Shane himself. This was a fun match to watch.
SummerSlam 01
[Greatest Superstars Of The 21st Century]

vs. WWE Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho - Jericho mocked Rock's ""Just Bring It"" which fired up the Rock to the point where he chased after Jericho & tackled him back into the ring before Jericho was able to get some offense in by grounding Rock with moves like his Lionsault & bulldog but kept making very arrogant covers.  Rock was caught Jericho off guard into the sharpshooter but Jericho regained the momentum due to a few distractions & even ripped off the Rock Bottom but was caught when attempting the People's Elbow with the Rock punishing Jericho using the steps & announce table on the outside.  They kept fighting back in the ring with Jericho eventually catching Rock in the Walls Of Jericho while Rock was able to execute an impactful DDT & later the People's Elbow.  This was like their previous No Mercy championship match with the difference being that Jericho was in full heel mode from relying on cheating & outside help while mocking The Rock whenever he could but still a competitive match.
Royal Rumble 02

vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - Despite Hogan's actions going into this match, he was clearly the crowd favorite from the start which helped build his momentum as Hogan kept knocking Rock down showing his strength which caused Rock to rebound with his athleticism as he knocked Hogan down with a running flying clothesline & punched Hogan out the ring as they kept trading momentum with one man taking the other down & beating on each other in the corner only for the other to return the favor right afterwords.  Hogan was able to gain the advantage with his power using a chokeslam to power Rock down before using dirty tactics such as choking with the wrist tape, a low blow, using his weight belt, and stealing Rock's own Rock Bottom but The Rock recovered using the belt against Hogan along with his Rock Bottom before Hogan did his classic ""Hulking Up"" followed by the big boot & leg drop which the Rock kicked out of & came back with two back to back Rock Bottom & People's Elbow.  Jerry Lawler had the one line after this match that perfectly describes this match, ""It did more than live up to the hype, it surpassed it"" as Hogan brought his A game here that we hadn't seen dating back to possibly the early days of WCW while the crowd so so heavily into it that Jim Ross called it perfectly when he said ""this is a WrestleMania moment"" when Hogan & Rock didn't even touch each other yet the crowd was going wild. The audience reacted to every move they made from picking the side that wasn't planned before going into this match to how they went crazy for everything that happened after the match as everything resulted in a positive in the end as The Rock got that important WrestleMania win that kept alluding his throughout his career while Hogan regained his fans.
WrestleMania X8
[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle - Taker & Rock had their own personal issues going into this match causing them to focus on each other initially until Angle made it clear that he wasn't going to be ignored only for that to result in both of them double teaming Angle but Angle was able to recover & taking Taker out using the steps on the outside before focusing on Rock using various suplexes. The action picked up between all 3 as each man would steal the others signature moves including the chokeslam. Rock Bottom, anklelock, and Angle slam before Angle & Taker faced off with each other that resulted in Angle bleeding & bring a chair into the match. Everyone continued to fight hard pulling out all the stops including their own signature holds like the Angle Slam & sharpshooter while also being able to pull out counters like the Last Ride into a triangle choke & Rock Bottom into the anklelock with everyone kicking out of everyone's finishing moves. This was one of the best triple threat matches at that time as you saw high impact action between all three men along with various one on one singles encounters between each men.
Vengeance 02
[History Of The WWE Championship; The Rock: Just Bring It - Collectors Edition]

vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was their first ever singles match with Rock dominate early with working over Eddie's arm with a deep armdrag takedown & armbar while also sending Eddie high during an overhead toss but Eddie rebounded & kept Rock grounded with a chinlock & a unique figure four head scissors.  Rock fought back hitting a spiked DDT before Eddie was able to give a counter to the Rock Bottom that I never seen before (or since) but unfortunately missed one high impact move that left an opening for The Rock to capitalize.  This match didn't go that long but was very competitive from start to finish as Eddie was a different type of competitor than The Rock usually faces.
""RAW"" July 02

vs. Steve Austin - These two faced off at WrestleMania for the third time & began trading blows early before brawling in the isleway back to ringside with The Rock thrown into the steps. The Rock targeted Austin's bad legs by clipping them twice & ramming his knee into the announce table & ring post followed by a sharpshooter. Rock started to get more cocky & wore Austin's vest only for it to bring him bad luck with Austin regaining the advantage before both men were able to apply each others finishers on each other before Rock was able to regain control hitting the people's elbow followed by three different Rock Bottom's to finally gain his victory over Austin at WrestleMania...in what we would later find out to be Austin's last match.
WrestleMania XIX
[Blu-Ray Edition Of Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]

It should be noted that you also get a brief background on his families wrestling history at the beginning of the presentation while DVD extras include highlights of his past one-liners & punchlines along with 16 of his past promos shown in full with commentary is removed from there so you don't hear Jerry Lawler or any of the other commentators during the promos.

While we didn't get a documentary on The Rock's career (that would come with the ""Epic Journey"" set years later), this was definitely an anthology of The Rock's career through his matches mixing some lost & forgotten encounters with the most significant ones of his career.  It did seem a bit incomplete when it first came out but the matches I felt shouldn't have been left off here were eventually released later elsewhere so the only real issue I can say I have here is that one of the really short encounters could have been left off that had no real relevance to The Rock's career still could have been left off in favor of a more significant match that still has yet to make it's way to a DVD release.  In the end, I recommend as this will leave you more satisfied than the movie ""Doom"" ever will (it's alright Dwayne, everyone acts in at least one crappy movie in their career.)",1213315200,3,18227,4.540993599512344
3071120,5,B00120LPQ0,"I know there have been Rock DVDs but none of them are an anthology collection like this one is.  From his early years, to his prime all the way to his departure from WWE, this DVD has it all.  One of the best is the third disc with all of the best Rock interviews.  This is a must have for those wrestling fans.",1213228800,,311,3.9047619047619047
3071121,3,B00120LPQ0,"OK.

First of all, I was the biggest Rock fan imaginable.  To me he brought everything that the WWE needed during the Monday night wars and the Attitude era.  He managed to bridge athleticism and entertainment in subtle ways, and helped to elevate some of the most memorable names: Owen Hart, HHH, Steve Austin, Booker T, etc.

So...if I'm such a fan, how could I dare give this anything lower than a 5?

I'll tell you why.  It's because this DVD set, being 3 DVDs, is severely disappointing.  It's almost like WWE did the bare minimum they could rather than really showcase this man and his many years in the company.  Geez, where do I begin...

1: The man's promos are scarce.  Where are his various promos and exchanges with Farooq, like when Rock gave him the portrait?  Where's the Nation of Domination's parody of DX?  Where's the faux funeral for Stone Cold?  Where's the ""die die die"" promo?  Where's the promo he cut on Paul Wight (Big Show) when he first debuted?  ""Know Your Role Michael Cole""?  The Rock's interaction with the first Diva Search contestants?  The Thanksgiving where we learned about the Rock's love of pie (and the fact that Michael Cole never had any)?  The infamous Trish kiss?  His interaction with Taijiri (sick freak)?  The Stephanie McMahon birthday jingle?  Rock/Austin singing together?  Rock's promo on Brock Lesnar?  ""Sing along with the Rock""?  The legendary Rock concert of 2003 ""...when the Lakers beat the Kings in May~!"" None of these are here, and it really pisses me off.

2: The matches are the bare basics.  Where's the Undisputed Championship match with him, Austin and Jericho?  Where's his single matches with Taker?  Why only two matches with Austin (but yet 4 matches with HHH)?  Where's his match with Ric Flair?  Chris Benoit (need I even ask...)?  What about Rock, Austin and the Hardyz vs. DX?  The Brahma Bullrope matches (ok, they might have been some crap, but I still wanted to see them!!)?  Rock vs. Lesnar?  Why didn't they show the WHOLE ""I Quit"" match with Mankind, including the controversial ending??  Ugh, I could go on and on.

3: None of the matches show Rock losing, even though he lost some of his greatest matches.

4: Way too much blurring of the ""F"" in the old WWF.  I mean, it's not like they're profiting off of the logo anymore, is it really necessary to have so much blurring?  I mean all the blur spots really do detract from what you see.

5: Why was this not released on Blu-ray in remastered HD quality like Wrestlemania 24?

6: Not published in widescreen.  Come on Vince, give me a break.  We're in 2008; get with the times please.

7: The whole DVD is organized as though it were trying to tell someone 50 years from now what ""The Rock"" was about.  I don't agree with that approach - 1, because it wasn't done very well with all of the stuff missing that I mentioned above, and 2, this should cater to fans or former fans.  That means it should be as thorough as it can be, not barebones.

Bottom line - there's a lot missing, and as a result, I can't justify giving this any more than 3 stars.",1213142400,6,3079,4.5346715328467155
3071135,3,B00120LPQ0,"Absolutely nothing on this DVD set. The glaring omission of commentary from The Rock himself diminishes the quality of the final product with the narration provided being subpar at best.

In terms of match selection, the matches were for the most part good selections. Some of my personal favorites did not make the DVD, and even arguably his best matches were left out. The promos included as extras were also very hit or miss. Some of his best were included, but at the same time some of my personal favorites were also left out.

On the whole, I would recommend this to any WWE fan, but be aware this is not the best release the company has made this year.",1213056000,,659,4.483333333333333
3071136,5,B00120LPQ0,"I picked up a copy of this this morning and just finished watching. Not only a great trip down memory lane, but a great, great dvd. It really makes me miss The Great One and I guess I never appreciated him as much as i should have back in the day. I am going to sit down a watch it again right now because I am Rock (hard).",1213056000,2,323,3.764705882352941
3071137,4,B00120LPQ0,"There is no denying that The Rock is one of the best performers the WWE will ever see. But what sadens me on many of the WWE DVD releases, and this one in particular is the constant need to put matches on it that were already on PPV's. I read a few reviews on here about the same thing, so I know I am not the only one that feels this way.

It makes no sense to place PPV matches on these compilations. Assume that only die-hard WWE fans are the ones buying these DVD's. Don't you think that many of us already paid for the Pay-Per-View, or bought the DVD of the event? I can undertand some of the earlier Rock matches that were on some of the lesser pay-per-views, but WrestleMania, Royal Rumbles, things like that, as fans we have seen.

I like that there are several matches from RAW on this collection, but not nearly enough. There should be matches that you just can't find in DVD quality anymore, like matches from Smackdown and RAW. We see the Royal Rumbles, we have all the PPV matches scattered on all sorts of DVD's for other superstars. I want the rare stuff that as a fan would really make me want to purchase this and truly walk away with the feeling that I have something special, as a fan. How many times have we all seen The Rock vs. Hogan? Like a million? You can easily replace this match with something else from 1999 when the attitude was at it's best. Where is the Rock concert stuff he did when he was asking the fans if they wanted to cheer or boo him. Or the night he says the Lakers are going to kick the Sacramento King's a%$es. Here is some great stuff there. How about the night Chris Jericho debuted? I understand there is so much to include, but there is just way to much pay-per-view matches here.

The other thing that bothers me is that The Rock does not get to talk about his influence in wrestling, that's simply the WWE being pissed off that he's moved on. I like it better when the guys get to tell their own story.

Needless to say I'll be there tomorrow to buy it.",1212969600,,2003,4.208333333333333
3071138,4,B00120LPQ0,"I was able to get a copy of this DVD early prior to the Tuesday release date and instead of listing all the matches, as they have already been discussed in other reviews, I will point out one Very Glaring Omission.

THE ROCK!!!

Being a Big ""Rock"" Fan I could not wait for the release of this DVD, and for the most part is has alot of great matches, one-liners and interviews. Sadly the Rock plays No Part in the DVD other than being in the matches themselves.

The Rock is treated as if he no longer exists. Starting with just the back of the package which leads you to believe the Rock is no longer even considered a part of wrestling only someone who defined it. Instead of The Rock introducing his matches we get only narration through this DVD set. No Superstar comments, No Feedback from Vince or J.R., NOTHING, Just a Narrator. Hell, even Bret Hart came back just to lend his thoughts on his matches and the latest releases such as Shawn Michaels and Hardy Boys have great insights and comments through out. Even the Stone Cold and HHH packages have themselves going through each match with many insights and feelings which make watching the matches agian even that more special.

So while I appreciate this DVD set and love the package in whole it was a BIG Disappointment to find out it's just 19 matches,the one-liners and the ""Original"" interviews(Raw, Smackdown & PPV's) with Nothing Else but Chessy Narration and not a hint of the ""Great One"" himself offering us some insight!!",1212710400,,1490,4.569288389513108
3071139,5,B00120LPQ0,"If you truly love wrestling, then you have to buy this dvd set. You may not like him, or think he ""turned his back"" on wrestling (which is horribly inaccurate, all wrestlers want to be actors, THATS WHAT THEY DO), he is without a doubt the most entertaining man in sports history. No one, and i mean NO ONE, could stir up the crowd the way he use to. They tried to replace him with people like John Cena and Triple H, but none of them could do it! He made you cheer whether you loved, or hated him. I haven't watched wrestling since he left, but i will most definitely buy this set.",1212537600,3,582,4.114035087719298
3071140,2,B00120LPQ0,"I will not get this one. sure having a good backstory can be a nice sell but the rock has had too many DVDs made about him. (I really wonder how much of it will be new and how much will just be taken from his old DVDs)

the matches really don't do much either, 4 vs. HHH, 3 vs. Mankind, 2 vs. austin along with 5 other matches are from raw or smackdown (meaning we will get cut outs for commericals). Plus none the matches listed on the DVD have that ""lost gem"" feeling.

WWE just put this together without any though because the name of ""the rock"" can still sell. (sadly)",1211155200,2,572,4.053097345132743
3071141,5,B00120LPQ0,"I cannot wait for this set. The match listing is pretty strong with a few omissions and even though I have alot of matches on other WWE dvds, but it seems like the promos are lacking. I wish they gave the Rock, the Dusty Rhodes treatment. Rhodes dvd has a short bio, 30 matches, and 50+ promos. The dvd case even said a few of Rhode's famous quotes. The Rock should have got that treatment. I hope that Rock' promo over Eddie Guerrero is shown in complete. I also hope they have the promos over Kurt Angle, his sparring with Jericho, and him stealing other wrestlers catch pharses but alas, it looks like promos that are released on Rock's other set-The People's Champ. Like one WWE announcer said ""He could beat you with words"" They could have made a three dvd set of him just cutting promos and doing interviews, and it would have been worth it. Im going get this set no matter what, he's what the WWE is missing so dearly right now.

He was also popular during the attitude era, so alot of matches will feature ton of blurs.",1210636800,3,1027,4.348958333333333
3071142,5,B00120LPQ0,"So far two match listings for this DVD set have been posted, both of which are different. So how do we know which one is legit?",1208217600,3,127,3.923076923076923
3071143,3,B00120LPQ0,"Can someone explain to me why the same wrestlers (superstars) are having DVD sets created for them; my god, this would be the 4th or 5th DVD the Rock has had, you can add up all of his other DVD's and have an anthology.  Now, I know he is not the only one; there is also ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, HHH, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, John Cena, Rey Mysterio, the Hardy Boys, and Hulk Hogan; just to name a few.  Here is an idea, why not wait and release one spectacular DVD set for these guys instead of 2-5 decent ones.  What about wrestlers like Big Show, Edge, Batista, Kane; guys who are obviously overlooked when it comes to things like this.",1207353600,,644,4.305785123966942

3305551,5,B00120LPQ0,"I thought that it was about time they released a DVD set with The Rock. The most electrifying man in sports entertainment today. He has been out of the ring for years. This will definitely have a lot of his great matches with his opponents such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, Mick Foley, Chris Benoit, Hulk Hogan, Kurt Angle, among others. I will upgrade this review as soon as I find out what this set will feature. Just by the looks of it, there are already some jabronis out there who don't understand this review. I read a different review from somebody who thinks that The Rock should be forgotten. I don't believe that statement because The Rock was smart enough to know when it was time to step down. Why would The Rock want to acomplish the same goals over and over again. Triple H many times has said that he had nothing left to prove but you still see him winning the same world title time after time again. The Rock has not forgotten about the wrestling business, he has just been making movies the last few years, where he is making millions and millions at the box office. At least The Rock does not do what ""Stone Cold Steve Austin"" does, show up to do a short stint, hog up somebody elses credit, puts a guy out with a Stone Cold Stunner without wrestling in a match and leaves back to the rat hole from whence he came from. Many reviewers won't like this statement but it is true. If you smell-la-la-la-la-laooooowww, what The Rock is cookin.",1205884800,2,1465,4.389705882352941

The wrap-around segments are quick and do not go into much depth or detail. It also does not feature any wrestler interviews, and no involvement from 'The Rock' himself.  There's a large selection of matches although a few opponents are repeated several times(not necessarily a bad thing).

And of course you get a nice selection of Rock's famous and charismatic promo's that helped build his popularity. Overall this is a nice set more for the matches than an in-depth look at his life or career. Worth picking up if you can find it at a good bargain price.",1417392000,2,834,4.859154929577465

You get 19 matches + bonus extras with this. It's got some entertainment value to it. It's a overall cool set. Disc 1 starts off with a 1997 match against HHH (WWE(f) Intercontinental Championship match. And works it's way through some matches from '98 into '99. The last match on disc 1 is The Rock vs Stone Cold for the WWE(f) Championship belt. Disc 2 starts off with a steel cage match between Rock & HHH. And ends with a Undisputed Championship match against. Chris Jericho. Disc 3 starts off with Wrestlemania X8's match between The Rock & Hulk Hogan. And end with a Wrestlmania XIX match against Stone Cold. Don't get me wrong it's worth getting, especially for under $10.00. I paid $4.00....The only real gripe I have with this DVD set is it felt in some way a bit repetetive. The Rock wrestles HHH 4 times,Mankind 3 times + once tag teaming with Mankind vs Undertaker & Big Show. Not to say that those matches were/are bad. But it just kinda makes it feel like a bit of the same. I would recommend this DVD set to any Rock,WWF,WWE,WCW fan.",1354838400,2,1194,4.431818181818182

3305591,3,B00120LPQ0,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was the most electrifying man in sports entertainment (and these days claims ""ALL of entertainment"") and you can watch many of his best matches and most memorable interviews and one-liners in this three-disc set that was released in 2008. With his recent return to the WWE, this is a great time for a refresher course in the history of The Rock.

This is one of those WWE sets where story is told in between matches instead of altogether in one documentary that you can sit and watch at once. What I find difficult about this is that people don't always have time to sit and watch this set for NINE hours in order to see the entire story. I much prefer the sets where you can watch the story all at once and then work on the matches over time. Plus there is an impartial narrator piecing the story together with soundbites from The Rock and NO interviews with the man himself talking about his past and how it felt at the time besides being the character.

The Rock wasn't always The Rock though, he started out as Rocky, paying tribute to his family lineage in wrestling from his grandfather, Rocky Maivia and his father, Rocky Johnson. He started out as a good guy, but didn't really have a concrete identity and fans turned on his one-dimensional nature. Within months people began to hate him and that's where The Rock was truly born. He took on the mic, spoke in third person, and started inventing catch phrases. He joined a stable, the Nation of Domination where he took over and kicked the leader out and insisted people call him ""ruler"". He became popular and eventually got out of the Nation of Domination. People began to love him and even after his heel turn becoming the Corporate Champion, people couldn't resist cheering for The Rock.

There was an epic extended feud with Mankind (with SEVERAL matches included in this set), icon vs icon against Stone Cold Steve Austin, feuds with Triple H on and off, one of my favorite storylines -- the Rock `N Sock connection, the infamous moment of facing Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania, and tons of other rivalries, but what is undeniable is The Rock's connection to the fans. He arches an eyebrow and they go nuts. He sticks his nose in the air and the arena goes silent so he can announce the name of the city he has FINALLY come back to. We can't get enough of what The Rock is cookin' and any silence over a few seconds prompts chanting of the Great One's name. He has tons of nicknames -- The Rock, The Great One, The People's Champion, The most Electrifiying Man in all of (Sports) Entertainment.

Few WWE Superstars have been able to exercise his level of complete captivation over his audience. His commitment and creativity and addictive one-liners are the reason he was able to become so popular and then bridge over into the film industry. He has been in several movies, some bad, some good enough, and one horrible film with him wearing a fairy costume that I still haven't been able to wipe completely from my memory. Sure, some fans were upset feeling like he deserted the WWE, but I haven't seen anyone who isn't thrilled to have him back to host this year's WrestleMania, complete with digs against the current most popular WWE Superstar, John Cena.

As time goes on, the matches get better and better, especially those with Mankind, Triple H, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Hogan match is epic and was an instant classic when it occurred as the most iconic wrestler ever met the most electrifying wrestler ever and both men gave each other respect afterward in a cool way. The give and take and back and forth is one of the most entertaining matches I've seen.

Extras:

16 of The Rock's best interview segments are featured here including ""Billy's prayer to God"", ""The Big Slow"", ""My Name is Kane"", ""Doughnuts"", ""Hermie"", ""Thomas Jefferson Sucka"", ""The People's Strudel"", ""Great Balls of Fire"", ""Copacabana"", ""The Charleston"", ""The Superhero"", ""Miami Dolphins"", and more! The segment of one-liners is nine minutes long (and can be previewed on Youtube since I shared it on the Haunted Flower Facebook page recently). Both comedy segments are amazingly entertaining and more fun than most of his matches if I'm being perfectly honest.",1301443200,2,5644,4.602385685884692
3305592,3,B00120LPQ0,"I ordered this DVD set with a lot of high hopes.  The Rock is one of my favorite superstars of all time, and one of the major reasons why I got back into wrestling in the late 90's.  Overall, I have to say I'm not that impressed by what we are given here.

I won't bother going into detail on the matches since there are dozens of other reviews that can tell you all about them.  I will, however, complain about the match choice.  There's no less than 4 Rock vs. HHH matches on this disc, and the Rock n Sock Connection match they chose was a one-sided affair where UT leaves and it's a handicap match.  I know you're a little more limited in terms of Rock n Sock matches, but that was the best you could find?

The Rock's early career is done rather piecemeal.  There is little mention of his time in the Nation of Domination, and only a tiny bit of time dedicated to his reign as the Corporate Champion.  There is a lot of stuff from his later career, post 2000.  I would much rather have had more time dedicated to the early and middle sections of his career where he was still coming up through the ranks.

Finally, and this is the biggest problem with the DVD set - The Rock doesn't speak.  It's not only him speaking about his own career, like telling his own story, but it's also a problem that the WWE decided not to show a lot of his classic promos from the time.  They mention on the discs that the Rock's birthday party (the one thrown by Mankind) was the highest rated TV segment in all of RAW history, and yet they only talk about it and show stills.  They show little cuts of more important promos in the documentary part, but never the whole thing.  Some of them are featured on the extras segment of disc three, but even there, only about eight of the twenty are pre-2000.  There are so many important, classic moments that are missing from this set that it's truly a shame.

The wrestling's pretty good, the Rock is the Rock, but this collection lacks that truly special stuff that it needs to be more than average.",1297728000,2,2032,4.263707571801566
3305599,5,B00120LPQ0,"Oh man....!!!! Wow!!!! Wow!!!! Wow!!!!!!!!!!! I still can't find a reason for, why this great superstar is not being selected in to the WWE Hall of Fame!!!",1295740800,,155,4.777777777777778
3305600,4,B00120LPQ0,I just like the rock so I got this. Lot of good matches and interviews.,1278028800,,71,3.8
3305601,4,B00120LPQ0,"Let me tell you, I'm a huge pro wrestling fan. So much, I used my Christmas list last year to start my DVD collection. I'm a fan of technical wrestlers, like Bret Hart, Mr. Perfect, Ted Dibiase, and I guess I'll throw in Ricky Steamboat. (Come to think of it, where are my Steamboat and Dibiase DVDs?) But if I had to choose one wrestler who was the absolute total package, and nearly perfect, it's The Rock. He had agility, talent, charisma, mic skills, and he could easily bring the crowd to his side, even when he was telling Canadians to kiss his ass. So it was only natural he would have his own DVD. And how is it? It's overall a nice package, but it's missing a bit.

First, the packaging is nice. The cover stands out, the inner covers look great, and the disks feature him delivering a Rock Bottom to, I believe, Owen Hart, Kane, and Hogan. It's much better than the pink black and white vomit that's splattered all over the Bret Hart disks.

The presentation is what you'd expect. The menus show video clips of The Rock and play his theme song. The between match videos explain where his feuds were going are nice and epic, but you don't hear a whole lot from the man behind The Rock. You hear how he got his start, but that's not really enough to me. Also, why the hell is Steve Austin's signature taunt censored? I mean, it's for private viewing, so why does it matter?

Now let's get to the extras first before the real matches. It's a collection of a good amount of his hilarious promos. Watch him say things about Vince's daughter that should have got him fired. Hear him call Goldust what we always think when he crosses our mind. From Billy's Prayer to God to his abuse of a camera man to his abuse of an interviewer to his abuse of two police officers... Hell, just watch a half hour of him abusing people. I can't think of many promos that were missed. His promo with the camera man is a testament to how well he could play to the crowd.

But the matches need work. You get his Wrestlemania XV and XIX matches with Steve Austin, some matches with Kurt Angle, (including their fantastic Triple Threat match with 'Taker.) But there's one that really angers me, but I won't take off for it because it's my own preference: His match with Chris Jericho. I just didn't want to be reminded of him on this DVD, and the match, in my opinion, isn't that spectacular. But the number one complaint is a certain match is missing. A certain match with one Mick Foley; Mankind. Yeah, they show footage from his... Spectacular match with Foley, but the match isn't there. Why!? It's one of his number one matches, so why did they have to leave it out? Maybe because it's less than The Rock's most flattering matches. He basically tortures him for half an hour. It's more for Foley fans, but that's no excuse.

All in all, there are some issues, but it really comes together in a nice collection of the most electrifying jabroni-beatin', pie-eatin', trail-blazin', eyebrow-raisin' peoples champ: The Rock.",1263340800,,3007,4.469945355191257

The Rock was the first ever 3rd generation superstar and the first superstar to ever win the WWE championship 7 times. The Rock could possibably be the most charasmatic & entertaining superstar of all time.

As far as for the DVD set goes, you will hear nothing from The Rock whatsoever. The narration is done by someone else but not by The Rock. You will also get nothing from other superstars either. The same as Tombstone: History of the Undertaker. The narrator goes through and discuss The Rock's Samoan heritage, his rise to fame and popularity, WWE title reigns, the connection with the fans and the hatred from the fans, and also feuds with Mankind, Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and others.

DISC 1
RAW 2.13.97
Intercontinental Title
Vs. Hunter Hearst Hemsley - The match told a pretty good inring story. It went at a good pace and the ending worked in very well. 4/5

RAW 4.6.98
Intercontinental Title
Vs. Owen Hart - This match started out pretty good. It was getting better as it progressed but the disqualification by Chyna is what killed it. 3.75/5

RAW 6.22.98
King of the Ring Quarter-Finals Match
Vs. Triple H - Much better match then the previous match between these two. It was more of a physical match. Both men looked pretty good. A very good match up. 4.5/5

Survivor Series 11.15.98
WWE Title
Vs. Mankind - A very good match between these two here. Much better then their Rock Bottom encounter. Foley & Rock took some hard slams and hard shots on the outside. Foley even crashes through the announce table at one point in the match. A very good title match. 4.5/5

St. Valentine's Day Massacre 2.14.99
Last Man Standing Match/WWE Title
Vs. Mankind - Not a bloody and violent match as their I Quit match was but still a very physical contest. A lot of hard shots taken in this one. 4.75/5

RAW 2.15.99
Ladder Match/WWE Title
Vs. Mankind - These two just left off from where they were the night before. The only addition was the ladder. And to include a Rock Bottom through a table. And also a chokeslam from Big Show to Mankind from the top of the ladder. Another good bout from these two. 4.5/5

Wrestlemania XV
WWE Title
Vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - A very good first Wrestlemania encounter from these two. They added the no dq rule to the match which did add more to it. Pretty good match. Some good brawling on the outside and a good table spot. 4.75/5

DISC 2
RAW 7.5.99
Steel Cage Match
Vs. Triple H - Not a bloody cage bout but I felt this was an outstanding match. A very solid match up. 5/5

RAW 8.30.99
WWE Tag Team Titles
w/ Mankind Vs. Undertaker & Big Show - I wasn't really all too fond of this tag bout. Taker's role in this match seemed like he didn't care. And he would actually leave the match half way in. Leaving Big Show by himself. Then it became a 2 on 1 match. Not the best tag match in my view but watchable. 3.5/5

Smackdown 12.30.99
No Holds Barred
Vs. Kane - Not a lot of spots here. Except for a table spot and Kane being thrown off the stage. Still a good match to watch. 3.75/5

Backlash 4.30.00
WWE Title
Vs. Triple H - Another good battle from these two. But it did get a little annoying with Vince at ringside and Shane as the special referee. It had a very impactive double rock bottom through the announce table to HHH and Shane. Special appearence from Stone Cold in this one. 4.75/5

RAW 5.1.00
Steel Cage Match/WWE Title
Vs. Shane McMahon - I didn't really like this match at all. It was entertaining but all of the interfernce from the McMahons & Triple H was too cheesy for a steel cage match. But still a match to watch. 3.5/5

No Way Out 2.25.01
WWE Title
Vs. Kurt Angle - I feel that their No Mercy match is way better but this match is still good and very worth seeing. Very intense also. A very good battle for the title. 4.75/5

Summerslam 8.19.01
WCW Heavyweight Title
Vs. Booker T - This match was very high energetic. Phenomenal action in the ring and on the outside. Some good near falls and a great title match. Very good main event from Summerslam. 4.75/5

Royal Rumble 1.20.02
Undisputed Title
Vs. Chris Jericho - I felt that this match was on the same level as their Vengeance bout. But didn't feel better then their match from No Mercy. A solid match with a good table spot. 4.5/5

DISC 3
Wrestlemania X8
Vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - An outstanding match and great to see the crowd go crazy during this match. The match was back and forth all the way. One of the greatest matches in Wrestlemania history. Rock kicks out of the Hogan leg drop and comes back to give Hogan two Rock Bottoms and then a People's Elbow to beat Hogan in Hogan's second Wrestlemania lost. 5/5

Vengeance 7.21.02
Undisputed Title
Vs. Undertaker Vs. Kurt Angle - This was a tremendous triple threat bout. You nearly saw everything in this match. Awesome contest and a great showing from all three men. 5/5

RAW 7.22.02
Vs. Eddie Guerrero. - I enjoyed this match. Very entertaining and very good to watch. 4/5

Wrestlemania XIX
Vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - The match started very intense and fierce. It had some good brawling and hard shots on the outside. There were some very nice counters too. Rock works on Austin's leg briefly but not that whole much. The Rock hit some very hard impact Rock Bottoms to Austin in this one. Rock and Austin puts on a very good showing here. 4.5/5

The Extra's are very good. They consist of many of The Rock's promos and one liners. I recommend this set. The matches that were picked out were very good and they all delivered for the majority. Again, this is a set that I recommend picking up someday.",1233878400,15,5683,4.434740882917467

Also, the DVD has some of his greatest promos that entertained the masses through the years -- and I got the DVD at a great buy here at Amazon, so that was a plus too.

Overall this is a pretty good buy for any wrestling fan, it includes most of the Rocks most famous and most exciting matches (The Kurt Angle matches are a must). I gave this 3 stars because of all the WWF logo cover ups, I mean seriously why on earth the World Wildlife Foundation thinks it's necessary for the WWE to blur everything out is beyond me, at times it's ridiculous..I mean covering up the logo on the belt?

It's all story..  We never hear what he was thinking about his matches.. How he got along with people backstage.. Problems he had on the road.. Nothin!!

So, it's good cause it has a tonne of his matches, but also kind of annoying because you never get his opinion on anything.. (Compared to the Triple H  - King of Kings or The Legacy of Stone Cold DVD where they talk about what they went through at certain stages).

Great backstage segments - excellent for a laugh..",1217203200,,728,4.395522388059701
3305612,4,B00120LPQ0,"This DVD set of The Rock was a very good collection with well thought out intros to every match.
However it would have been great in my books if they had added a few more things such as the time The Rock had to choose WWF or Alliance, he gave Vince a Rock Bottom and Shane Both a Rock Bottom and Peoples elbow.
Another thing was the match for wrestling supremacy WWF vs The Alliance tag match that saw Kurt Angle turn on the Alliance by distracting then immobilizing Stone Cold, before Rock finishing Austin off with a Rock Bottom.
Would had also been nice if they showed a bit more of the in fighting within the Nation of Domination, especially the Farooq/Rock rivalry.

This dvd was below wwe standards I mean dam no commentary at all. you got commentary for dam near all the other dvds and none for this one. I am sure not everyone has a bitter taste in their mouth because rock left. Then as someone else said match selection was subpar as was promo selection.

3305616,4,B00120LPQ0,"NOTE: Updated this review in 2013

Regardless of how you feel about Dwayne Johnson & his relationship (or lack thereof) with the WWE for the past couple of years & his movie career, nobody can deny that The Rock was without one of the top superstars in WWE's past & has not only made an impact in wrestling (in the ring or on the microphone) & outside of it to the point where the word ""smackdown"" is now in the dictionary. This DVD set is a look back at his most of his career through an anthology of matches as The Rock didn't participate in this project so a voice over narrates you throughout the presentation.

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was back a few months into his debut year before he claimed the name ""The Rock"" & was still going by Rocky Maivia with us already getting a preview of things to come you already heard some ""Rocky Sucks!"" chants early.  Both men attempted to ground each other early as Rocky applied a leg scissors while Hunter applied the chinlock before a mistimed move by Rocky allowed Hunter to work over the shoulder while also beating down Rocky with a neckbreaker & suplex.  Rocky kept trying to mount some offense but Hunter was always one step ahead reversing & countering but Rocky refused to quit & kept kicking out before one mistake was made allowing the other to capitalize in a big way.
""RAW"" Feb. 97

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Owen Hart - This match went around 5 minutes & was too short to make anything of note past how this was just a backdrop to Owen's continued problems with D-Generation X around this time.
""RAW"" Apr. 98

vs. Triple H - This was the quarter final round in the King Of The Ring tournament that went back & forth between both men but served the purpose of pushing the growing conflict between DX & The Nation with members of both groups making their presence known during & after the match.
""RAW"" June 98

WWE Championship Match vs. Mankind - The finals of the ""Deadly Game"" tournament was best described by Jim Ross during the match when saying ""The Rock turned it up!"" because this was one of the times you saw The Rock get real aggressive, the moment he saw Mr. McMahon at ringside, against Mankind in the ring along with taking it outside the ring including various moments such as both men using chairs including Rock repeating slamming the chair onto the steel steps which were on top of Mankind & fighting on the announce tables. In the end, Vince McMahon gets his ""Corporate Champion"" using a finish that was complete ""deja vu.""
Survivor Series 98
[The Attitude Era]

Last Man Standing Match vs. WWE Champion Mankind - Mankind came into this match with a bad knee due to Rock attacking him earlier in the night as Mankind purposely turned his back on Rock allowing him to get the first punches in before he retaliated using the championship belt.  The fight went to the stage & technical area where both men took hard falls like a DDT through a table & suplex on the concrete as they made their way back to ringside where he had a few comedic moments from The Rock on commentary to Mankind's ""Mr. Elbow"" & later some ""SmackDown Hotel"" before they got more violent using whatever was near them such as the announce table, chair, and the steps including one moment where Rock dropped the stairs out of the ring onto Mankind's knee on the outside causing Lawler to comment, ""It's getting out of hand now.""  This match followed the formula of their previous matches in this feud (I Quit & Empty Arena) where it was a physical hardcore brawl where they beat each other until they had nothing left...literally.
St. Valentine's Day Massacre 99

Ladder Match vs. WWE Champion Mankind - After countless encounters over the previous months including such matches as ""I Quit"" & Last Man Standing & fights in an empty arena, this was their final encounter for the WWE Championship with the winner going into the title match against Steve Austin (who was also on commentary for this match. Mankind came into the match with a bad leg from the night before & they started this match on the floor with Rock targeting the legs right away by throwing Mankind into the steps legs first before slamming it into a chair multiple times. The ladder was brought into play by The Rock only for Mankind to start using it as a weapon by nailing it with a chair multiple times while Rock was trapped underneath but Rock continued to work over Mankind's bad knee to prevent him from climbing including hitting the ladder with a chair while his leg was wedged in-between & constantly hitting it with a chair whenever Mankind tried to climb. They took the fight to the outside brawling through the crowd before making their way back ringside & through the announce table but it was a ""big nasty"" presence that was the difference maker in the end.
""RAW"" Feb. 99
[Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

WWE Championship/No Disqualification Match vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - Austin came out in a t-shirt instead of his usual vest & took the fight to The Rock quickly as they brawled through the crowd to the stage area back to ringside with Austin dropping two elbow drops on Rock through the spanish table. A chair was put into play that caused the referee to accidentally get hit while Rock later used the chair to attack Austin all over his body before another referee was taken out. With Vince McMahon making his way to ringside along with the original special guest referee for this match, this was a match that lived up to the hype.
WrestleMania XV
[Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]

Steel Cage Match vs. Triple H - The only way to win this cage match was by escaping the cage as both men started delivering the hard hits early such as Rock with an impactful clothesline with Triple H later yanking Rock so hard off the top rope that his face hit the turnbuckle on the way down.  Chyna made her presence numerous times including handing Triple H a weapon to punch Rock & later preventing Rock from escaping while Rock fought just as dirty as they were with such tactics as using a low blow while also arm whipping Triple H off the top rope at one point.  Both men took the fight outside of the cage brawling on the outside including being rammed into the cage multiple times & fighting on the top of the cage where a chair was brought into play as well before this match was race to the end.  While this wasn't one of their more well known or classic encounters, it was one of their better forgotten matches.
""RAW"" July 99

w/Mankind vs. World Tag Team Champions Undertaker & Big Show - It was during this time that the Undertaker/Big Show alliance was all about Taker showing ""tough love"" to Show trying to turn him into an evil giant which we saw early on as Show was double teamed by Rock & Mankind while Undertaker did nothing but walk over to his corner before Show was able to overcome it to dominate Mankind with Taker getting his shots on the outside including throwing him into steps & brawling in the front row while Show slammed Foley onto the announce table he broke earlier in the night.  Undertaker for some reason decided to just walk off & leave Show to fight for himself until the odds just caught up to him with some additional help The Rock grabbed on the outside.  The match wasn't much but important as it was the birth of ""The Rock N' Sock Connection.""
""RAW"" Aug. 99

No Holds Barred Match vs. Kane - This match came about when Kane's girlfriend Tori accused The Rock of making a move on her as both men were intense from the start trading punches before quickly taking the fight to the ramp where a tombstone & Rock Bottom were attempted on the ramp before they took some hard hits like a fall off the ramp & later going through a table with a chair coming into play as well.  This match didn't go long but was physical from start to finish.
""SmackDown!"" Dec. 99

vs. WWE Champion Triple H - This was Rock's rematch from WrestleMania after Mr. McMahon screwed him out of the title that night but the odds were stacked against him with Shane McMahon as the referee, Stephanie & Mr. McMahon in Triple H's corner, and Steve Austin not being in The Rock's corner like he was advertised to be.  This was intense from the opening bell as they traded momentum with Triple H going for the pedigree early before being able to take advantage using the steps & announce table on the outside while clearly cheating in-front of Shane who didn't do anything about it while Mr. McMahon got his hits in as well throughout the match whenever The Rock would start to gain momentum.  The Rock caught a break when Triple H hurt his shoulder which The Rock targeted both in & outside the ring but Shane refused to count causing The Rock to take matters into his own hands before Mr. McMahon called for backup before some help finally came The Rock from people who had their own issues against Triple H & the McMahons.  This was the type of non-stop action main event expected from these two with all of the outside parties contributing to the match instead of distracting from it.
(Special Referee - Shane McMahon)
Backlash 00

WWE Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. Shane McMahon - This was setup the next night with the odds once again being stacked against The Rock as the McMahons & an injured Triple H were on the outside of the cage while Pat Patterson & Gerald Brisco were the special referees for the match.  The Rock was dominate early tossing Shane around the cage while the McMahons did whatever they could to help Shane with Vince trying to pull him out & Triple H spearing Rock with a stick & the referees working against Rock only for each attempt to backfire against Shane.  This was a fun match to watch with Shane taking some hard hits while the commentary was very humorous with Jim Ross constantly making jokes about Pat Patterson's ""personal life.""
""RAW"" May 00

vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle - This started off very intense early as both men went for their submission moves early before trading the same release belly to belly suplex back & forth with Rock delivering some hard hits like a superplex & a drilling DDT before someone who had an issue with both came out & took out his aggressions on both men.  The aggression picked up between both men even more with Angle applying the anklelock for close to a minute before both men kicked out of the others signature move while also on the receiving end of an exposed turnbuckle to the point where it took not one but two hard finishers to keep one man down for a three count.  This was an intense aggressive match from start to finish.
No Way Out 01
[The Rock: Just Bring It]

vs. WCW Champion Booker T - This was The Rock's return to PPV since his WrestleMania match months earlier. Both men traded momentum back & forth with Shane McMahon trying to get involved early on only for it to work against Booker as the fight went to to the floor & into the crowd at one point. Booker was able to gain the advantage & kept breaking the momentum whenever Rock tried to build it. Shane kept getting involved which finally caught up to him thanks to some people who's business he got involved in earlier in the night before Rock took care of Shane himself. This was a fun match to watch.
SummerSlam 01
[Greatest Superstars Of The 21st Century]

vs. WWE Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho - Jericho mocked Rock's ""Just Bring It"" which fired up the Rock to the point where he chased after Jericho & tackled him back into the ring before Jericho was able to get some offense in by grounding Rock with moves like his Lionsault & bulldog but kept making very arrogant covers.  Rock was caught Jericho off guard into the sharpshooter but Jericho regained the momentum due to a few distractions & even ripped off the Rock Bottom but was caught when attempting the People's Elbow with the Rock punishing Jericho using the steps & announce table on the outside.  They kept fighting back in the ring with Jericho eventually catching Rock in the Walls Of Jericho while Rock was able to execute an impactful DDT & later the People's Elbow.  This was like their previous No Mercy championship match with the difference being that Jericho was in full heel mode from relying on cheating & outside help while mocking The Rock whenever he could but still a competitive match.
Royal Rumble 02

vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - Despite Hogan's actions going into this match, he was clearly the crowd favorite from the start which helped build his momentum as Hogan kept knocking Rock down showing his strength which caused Rock to rebound with his athleticism as he knocked Hogan down with a running flying clothesline & punched Hogan out the ring as they kept trading momentum with one man taking the other down & beating on each other in the corner only for the other to return the favor right afterwords.  Hogan was able to gain the advantage with his power using a chokeslam to power Rock down before using dirty tactics such as choking with the wrist tape, a low blow, using his weight belt, and stealing Rock's own Rock Bottom but The Rock recovered using the belt against Hogan along with his Rock Bottom before Hogan did his classic ""Hulking Up"" followed by the big boot & leg drop which the Rock kicked out of & came back with two back to back Rock Bottom & People's Elbow.  Jerry Lawler had the one line after this match that perfectly describes this match, ""It did more than live up to the hype, it surpassed it"" as Hogan brought his A game here that we hadn't seen dating back to possibly the early days of WCW while the crowd so so heavily into it that Jim Ross called it perfectly when he said ""this is a WrestleMania moment"" when Hogan & Rock didn't even touch each other yet the crowd was going wild. The audience reacted to every move they made from picking the side that wasn't planned before going into this match to how they went crazy for everything that happened after the match as everything resulted in a positive in the end as The Rock got that important WrestleMania win that kept alluding his throughout his career while Hogan regained his fans.

vs. WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle - Taker & Rock had their own personal issues going into this match causing them to focus on each other initially until Angle made it clear that he wasn't going to be ignored only for that to result in both of them double teaming Angle but Angle was able to recover & taking Taker out using the steps on the outside before focusing on Rock using various suplexes. The action picked up between all 3 as each man would steal the others signature moves including the chokeslam. Rock Bottom, anklelock, and Angle slam before Angle & Taker faced off with each other that resulted in Angle bleeding & bring a chair into the match. Everyone continued to fight hard pulling out all the stops including their own signature holds like the Angle Slam & sharpshooter while also being able to pull out counters like the Last Ride into a triangle choke & Rock Bottom into the anklelock with everyone kicking out of everyone's finishing moves. This was one of the best triple threat matches at that time as you saw high impact action between all three men along with various one on one singles encounters between each men.
Vengeance 02
[History Of The WWE Championship; The Rock: Just Bring It - Collectors Edition]

vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was their first ever singles match with Rock dominate early with working over Eddie's arm with a deep armdrag takedown & armbar while also sending Eddie high during an overhead toss but Eddie rebounded & kept Rock grounded with a chinlock & a unique figure four head scissors.  Rock fought back hitting a spiked DDT before Eddie was able to give a counter to the Rock Bottom that I never seen before (or since) but unfortunately missed one high impact move that left an opening for The Rock to capitalize.  This match didn't go that long but was very competitive from start to finish as Eddie was a different type of competitor than The Rock usually faces.
""RAW"" July 02

vs. Steve Austin - These two faced off at WrestleMania for the third time & began trading blows early before brawling in the isleway back to ringside with The Rock thrown into the steps. The Rock targeted Austin's bad legs by clipping them twice & ramming his knee into the announce table & ring post followed by a sharpshooter. Rock started to get more cocky & wore Austin's vest only for it to bring him bad luck with Austin regaining the advantage before both men were able to apply each others finishers on each other before Rock was able to regain control hitting the people's elbow followed by three different Rock Bottom's to finally gain his victory over Austin at WrestleMania...in what we would later find out to be Austin's last match.

[Blu-Ray Edition Of Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]

It should be noted that you also get a brief background on his families wrestling history at the beginning of the presentation while DVD extras include highlights of his past one-liners & punchlines along with 16 of his past promos shown in full with commentary is removed from there so you don't hear Jerry Lawler or any of the other commentators during the promos.

While we didn't get a documentary on The Rock's career (that would come with the ""Epic Journey"" set years later), this was definitely an anthology of The Rock's career through his matches mixing some lost & forgotten encounters with the most significant ones of his career.  It did seem a bit incomplete when it first came out but the matches I felt shouldn't have been left off here were eventually released later elsewhere so the only real issue I can say I have here is that one of the really short encounters could have been left off that had no real relevance to The Rock's career still could have been left off in favor of a more significant match that still has yet to make it's way to a DVD release.  In the end, I recommend as this will leave you more satisfied than the movie ""Doom"" ever will (it's alright Dwayne, everyone acts in at least one crappy movie in their career.)",1213315200,3,18227,4.540993599512344
3305617,5,B00120LPQ0,"I know there have been Rock DVDs but none of them are an anthology collection like this one is.  From his early years, to his prime all the way to his departure from WWE, this DVD has it all.  One of the best is the third disc with all of the best Rock interviews.  This is a must have for those wrestling fans.",1213228800,,311,3.9047619047619047
3305618,3,B00120LPQ0,"OK.

First of all, I was the biggest Rock fan imaginable.  To me he brought everything that the WWE needed during the Monday night wars and the Attitude era.  He managed to bridge athleticism and entertainment in subtle ways, and helped to elevate some of the most memorable names: Owen Hart, HHH, Steve Austin, Booker T, etc.

So...if I'm such a fan, how could I dare give this anything lower than a 5?

I'll tell you why.  It's because this DVD set, being 3 DVDs, is severely disappointing.  It's almost like WWE did the bare minimum they could rather than really showcase this man and his many years in the company.  Geez, where do I begin...

1: The man's promos are scarce.  Where are his various promos and exchanges with Farooq, like when Rock gave him the portrait?  Where's the Nation of Domination's parody of DX?  Where's the faux funeral for Stone Cold?  Where's the ""die die die"" promo?  Where's the promo he cut on Paul Wight (Big Show) when he first debuted?  ""Know Your Role Michael Cole""?  The Rock's interaction with the first Diva Search contestants?  The Thanksgiving where we learned about the Rock's love of pie (and the fact that Michael Cole never had any)?  The infamous Trish kiss?  His interaction with Taijiri (sick freak)?  The Stephanie McMahon birthday jingle?  Rock/Austin singing together?  Rock's promo on Brock Lesnar?  ""Sing along with the Rock""?  The legendary Rock concert of 2003 ""...when the Lakers beat the Kings in May~!"" None of these are here, and it really pisses me off.

2: The matches are the bare basics.  Where's the Undisputed Championship match with him, Austin and Jericho?  Where's his single matches with Taker?  Why only two matches with Austin (but yet 4 matches with HHH)?  Where's his match with Ric Flair?  Chris Benoit (need I even ask...)?  What about Rock, Austin and the Hardyz vs. DX?  The Brahma Bullrope matches (ok, they might have been some crap, but I still wanted to see them!!)?  Rock vs. Lesnar?  Why didn't they show the WHOLE ""I Quit"" match with Mankind, including the controversial ending??  Ugh, I could go on and on.

3: None of the matches show Rock losing, even though he lost some of his greatest matches.

4: Way too much blurring of the ""F"" in the old WWF.  I mean, it's not like they're profiting off of the logo anymore, is it really necessary to have so much blurring?  I mean all the blur spots really do detract from what you see.

5: Why was this not released on Blu-ray in remastered HD quality like Wrestlemania 24?

6: Not published in widescreen.  Come on Vince, give me a break.  We're in 2008; get with the times please.

7: The whole DVD is organized as though it were trying to tell someone 50 years from now what ""The Rock"" was about.  I don't agree with that approach - 1, because it wasn't done very well with all of the stuff missing that I mentioned above, and 2, this should cater to fans or former fans.  That means it should be as thorough as it can be, not barebones.

Bottom line - there's a lot missing, and as a result, I can't justify giving this any more than 3 stars.",1213142400,6,3079,4.5346715328467155
3305632,3,B00120LPQ0,"Absolutely nothing on this DVD set. The glaring omission of commentary from The Rock himself diminishes the quality of the final product with the narration provided being subpar at best.

In terms of match selection, the matches were for the most part good selections. Some of my personal favorites did not make the DVD, and even arguably his best matches were left out. The promos included as extras were also very hit or miss. Some of his best were included, but at the same time some of my personal favorites were also left out.

On the whole, I would recommend this to any WWE fan, but be aware this is not the best release the company has made this year.",1213056000,,659,4.483333333333333
3305633,5,B00120LPQ0,"I picked up a copy of this this morning and just finished watching. Not only a great trip down memory lane, but a great, great dvd. It really makes me miss The Great One and I guess I never appreciated him as much as i should have back in the day. I am going to sit down a watch it again right now because I am Rock (hard).",1213056000,2,323,3.764705882352941
3305634,4,B00120LPQ0,"There is no denying that The Rock is one of the best performers the WWE will ever see. But what sadens me on many of the WWE DVD releases, and this one in particular is the constant need to put matches on it that were already on PPV's. I read a few reviews on here about the same thing, so I know I am not the only one that feels this way.

It makes no sense to place PPV matches on these compilations. Assume that only die-hard WWE fans are the ones buying these DVD's. Don't you think that many of us already paid for the Pay-Per-View, or bought the DVD of the event? I can undertand some of the earlier Rock matches that were on some of the lesser pay-per-views, but WrestleMania, Royal Rumbles, things like that, as fans we have seen.

I like that there are several matches from RAW on this collection, but not nearly enough. There should be matches that you just can't find in DVD quality anymore, like matches from Smackdown and RAW. We see the Royal Rumbles, we have all the PPV matches scattered on all sorts of DVD's for other superstars. I want the rare stuff that as a fan would really make me want to purchase this and truly walk away with the feeling that I have something special, as a fan. How many times have we all seen The Rock vs. Hogan? Like a million? You can easily replace this match with something else from 1999 when the attitude was at it's best. Where is the Rock concert stuff he did when he was asking the fans if they wanted to cheer or boo him. Or the night he says the Lakers are going to kick the Sacramento King's a%$es. Here is some great stuff there. How about the night Chris Jericho debuted? I understand there is so much to include, but there is just way to much pay-per-view matches here.

The other thing that bothers me is that The Rock does not get to talk about his influence in wrestling, that's simply the WWE being pissed off that he's moved on. I like it better when the guys get to tell their own story.

Needless to say I'll be there tomorrow to buy it.",1212969600,,2003,4.208333333333333
3305635,4,B00120LPQ0,"I was able to get a copy of this DVD early prior to the Tuesday release date and instead of listing all the matches, as they have already been discussed in other reviews, I will point out one Very Glaring Omission.

THE ROCK!!!

Being a Big ""Rock"" Fan I could not wait for the release of this DVD, and for the most part is has alot of great matches, one-liners and interviews. Sadly the Rock plays No Part in the DVD other than being in the matches themselves.

The Rock is treated as if he no longer exists. Starting with just the back of the package which leads you to believe the Rock is no longer even considered a part of wrestling only someone who defined it. Instead of The Rock introducing his matches we get only narration through this DVD set. No Superstar comments, No Feedback from Vince or J.R., NOTHING, Just a Narrator. Hell, even Bret Hart came back just to lend his thoughts on his matches and the latest releases such as Shawn Michaels and Hardy Boys have great insights and comments through out. Even the Stone Cold and HHH packages have themselves going through each match with many insights and feelings which make watching the matches agian even that more special.

So while I appreciate this DVD set and love the package in whole it was a BIG Disappointment to find out it's just 19 matches,the one-liners and the ""Original"" interviews(Raw, Smackdown & PPV's) with Nothing Else but Chessy Narration and not a hint of the ""Great One"" himself offering us some insight!!",1212710400,,1490,4.569288389513108
3305636,5,B00120LPQ0,"If you truly love wrestling, then you have to buy this dvd set. You may not like him, or think he ""turned his back"" on wrestling (which is horribly inaccurate, all wrestlers want to be actors, THATS WHAT THEY DO), he is without a doubt the most entertaining man in sports history. No one, and i mean NO ONE, could stir up the crowd the way he use to. They tried to replace him with people like John Cena and Triple H, but none of them could do it! He made you cheer whether you loved, or hated him. I haven't watched wrestling since he left, but i will most definitely buy this set.",1212537600,3,582,4.114035087719298
3305637,2,B00120LPQ0,"I will not get this one. sure having a good backstory can be a nice sell but the rock has had too many DVDs made about him. (I really wonder how much of it will be new and how much will just be taken from his old DVDs)

the matches really don't do much either, 4 vs. HHH, 3 vs. Mankind, 2 vs. austin along with 5 other matches are from raw or smackdown (meaning we will get cut outs for commericals). Plus none the matches listed on the DVD have that ""lost gem"" feeling.

WWE just put this together without any though because the name of ""the rock"" can still sell. (sadly)",1211155200,2,572,4.053097345132743
3305638,5,B00120LPQ0,"I cannot wait for this set. The match listing is pretty strong with a few omissions and even though I have alot of matches on other WWE dvds, but it seems like the promos are lacking. I wish they gave the Rock, the Dusty Rhodes treatment. Rhodes dvd has a short bio, 30 matches, and 50+ promos. The dvd case even said a few of Rhode's famous quotes. The Rock should have got that treatment. I hope that Rock' promo over Eddie Guerrero is shown in complete. I also hope they have the promos over Kurt Angle, his sparring with Jericho, and him stealing other wrestlers catch pharses but alas, it looks like promos that are released on Rock's other set-The People's Champ. Like one WWE announcer said ""He could beat you with words"" They could have made a three dvd set of him just cutting promos and doing interviews, and it would have been worth it. Im going get this set no matter what, he's what the WWE is missing so dearly right now.

He was also popular during the attitude era, so alot of matches will feature ton of blurs.",1210636800,3,1027,4.348958333333333
3305639,5,B00120LPQ0,"So far two match listings for this DVD set have been posted, both of which are different. So how do we know which one is legit?",1208217600,3,127,3.923076923076923
3305640,3,B00120LPQ0,"Can someone explain to me why the same wrestlers (superstars) are having DVD sets created for them; my god, this would be the 4th or 5th DVD the Rock has had, you can add up all of his other DVD's and have an anthology.  Now, I know he is not the only one; there is also ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, HHH, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, John Cena, Rey Mysterio, the Hardy Boys, and Hulk Hogan; just to name a few.  Here is an idea, why not wait and release one spectacular DVD set for these guys instead of 2-5 decent ones.  What about wrestlers like Big Show, Edge, Batista, Kane; guys who are obviously overlooked when it comes to things like this.",1207353600,,644,4.305785123966942
