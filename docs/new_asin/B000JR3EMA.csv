2678554,5,B000JR3EMA,"This isn't as laugh out loud funny as Nabokov's late 1950's masterpiece Lolita. Despair, as the title suggests, is a novel(and film) about Despair. And yet there are certain similarities. Both films are about a highly refined Russian exile living among crass bourgeoisie.  Also both Lolita and Despair have lead characters who have double names. Lolita has Humbert Humbert & Despair Hermann Hermann. The double name suggests among other things the way exiles live a kind of double life--one part of their selves hopelessly lost in an irrevocable past  and the other desperately trying to assimilate into a foreign culture that despite ones efforts remains foreign. Nabokov's characters never give up their past, in fact they prefer it to a present that simply cannot measure up. And this division almost always ends in tragedy.
In Despair(which is an English language film directed by a German director) Dirk Bogarde(Hermann) plays a Rusian born chocolate manufacturer living in exile in 1930's Berlin just as the Nazis are coming to power. The first words we hear are Hermann's fond reminiscences of his mother Russia. Hermann is immaculately attired and he speaks with fondness of all the refined things in life like literature but he is surrounded by people including his wife who read pulp novels and oddly, ironically, and perhaps appropriately enough Hermanns life begins more and more to resemble one of those pulp novels. Like Kubrick(who directed Lolita) Fassbinder has a perfect feel for Nabokovian black comedy. Hermann's ""despair"" at films beginning has already evolved to the point where he begins to disassociate from himself and in a very funny scene he confesses his fears to a man who looks remarkably like Freud and who he assumes to be a psychoanalyst but who, it turns out, is merely an insurance salesman. The plot revolves around Hermanns film noir inspired plan to have his despairing half murdered so that he can begin living again. Hermann does committ his convoluted ""murder"". And from then on the film follows Hermann to ever more remote Swiss villages in his quest to escape himself. A rare kind of film that is funny, sharp, and moving sometimes all at the same time.",1051315200,7,2196,5.03021978021978
8152744,4,B000JR3EMA,"""Despair"" is a sublime meditation about existence, and, its complex meaning. This might as well be one of the most atypical movies ever directed by R.W. Fassbinder, it has more of an International co-production flavor, and, handsome look, definitely more period sets, costumes, and, make up, and, it looks like it was shot in a much longer, and, more ""mainstream"" shooting schedules, than other Fassbinder's movies (some of the better ones were notoriously shot over a 3 weeks spawn, but this seems a film produced with a more regular scheme, and, obviously a larger budget, and, international cast and crew! And, it is especially thanks to the casting of the quite unforgettable and of course English speaking, Dirk Bogarde, as the conflicted and enigmatic lead, the actor embodies with painful sarcasm, giving to his difficult, multi layered role a class completely out of the ordinary and a presence that is as penetrating as it is quite haunting, with an ensemble of exceptional actors such as the French Andrea Ferreol, in a very unusual movie appearance. The incredible script by Tom Stoppard is wildly ironic, and, so is the tone of this compelling if complex movie capable to deal with extremely profound sentiments, madness, despair, and, finally, 1930's Nazi's rise to power, still always maintaining a wonderful stalking impact and visual ground breaking choices. The whole film suffers at times of the more usual, much stronger style of its genius director, while, at the same time, it does indeed present a whole new key to a quite diverse interpretation of Fassbinder's personal vision, and work, who seemingly was striving here to shoot in a contest of almost much more international cinema, thinking also to wider and diversified audiences. While the result is not always completely accomplished, it is still a stunning movie, rich of a saturated cinematography that perfectly evokes the times and the places, while, if Fassbinder's usual genius may here seem a little compromised, it is nonetheless worthy the name of one of the most poetic, innovative, and wildly innovative directors of all times.",1452211200,2,2116,5.136231884057971
8152745,1,B000JR3EMA,"(This is a comment on the Olive Films blu-ray release.) True to form, Olive Films omits English subtitles and closed captions. In this film, subtitles are absolutely necessary if you want to catch all of Bogarde's lines, which he delivers in a hard-to-understand, feigned foreign accent. This makes it especially difficult for viewers who are not native English speakers, or whose hearing is less than perfect, to follow all the dialogue. It would cost Olive Films a negligible amount to add subtitles to their blu-ray releases, but for some reason they are determined to ignore the wishes of a large segment of their home video audience.",1418256000,16,638,5.028301886792453

8152749,4,B000JR3EMA,that really shows off what blu-ray can do for an old film. An unfulfilled rich chocolate factory owner in 1930's Germany drifts out of society.  I'm not sure the how or why is ever explained.  It's a very frequent Fassbinder theme: the individual's spirit slowly being crushed.,1338249600,,277,4.872340425531915
8152750,5,B000JR3EMA,"Out of all the hard-to-find movies in the days of VHS & then, up until summer 2011, DVD, 'Despair' was one of the rarest. Now Olive Films have given us a beautiful transfer which is one example of how brilliant and perfect a Blu-ray disc can and should look. With the documentary of over 70 mins, this Blu-ray is well worth it! And for those of you who don't have an American Zone A Blu-ray player, don't worry, this disc is ZONE FREE!",1324684800,4,435,4.253012048192771

The superb British actor DIRK BOGARDE puts in a masterful performance as a man slowly disintegrating into madness.  Beautifully lit and staged, this is a film that will also make you think and then watch it again to catch nuances you missed in the first viewing. Fassbinder and Bogarde at their best.",1305849600,7,827,5.338461538461538
8152752,5,B000JR3EMA,"If you want fun and games don't watch this film. As the title suggests, it is not for the faint hearted. Dirk Bogarde was the right actor to portray the outwardly calm, successful business man, who rapidly helter-skeltered into despair, and madness. Sir Dirk has only to raise an eyebrow, shed a tear for you to be on his side. His instinctive acting hold you spellbound, throughly absorbed in his geninus. If you want to see a great film, try and find this movie. It is rare at the moment, but is due to be released as a re-mastered dvd in the summer.",1302307200,5,552,4.368932038834951
8152753,4,B000JR3EMA,"Dirk Bogarde does an excellent job in portraying a once-Hungarian, now German, who inherited a chocolate factory (do NOT think Willy Wonka!)from his father-in law. It's the early '30s; times are getting harder and harder. He's married to a perhaps attractive to him at one time (but not to him anymore--if ever) vapid German Jew, and is intelligent enough to see that--times will get even worse. He hates his life, increasingly, and more and more--stands apart from it (at the beginning of the film, while he is making love to his wife, he sees himself sitting against the wall of the room, observing the operation). He seems to relate to no one, and perhaps doesn't know how to, or even want to. Gradually, he sinks into insanity. He thinks he has hatched a scheme to make a ""killing,""--but he hasn't. He mearly kills.

The film is so dark, and angular, and (occasionally) arty, that only Bogarde's acting (the rest of the cast is good, too) makes it really worth owning--but it should be seen, for that reason alone. As often with depictions of the insane, one is occasionally confused as to what is really happening, and what the protagonist THINKS is happening.

It's a very cold movie, and there's nothing to laugh at. For instance: early in the film, the protagonist has travelled some distance to do business with another chocolate manufacturer--and, for some reason, starts telling him a little about his life. He mentions his wife's dowrey--her weight in gold coin. ""Upon examination,"" he says coldly, scornfully, despairingly, ""the gold coins proved to be chocolate."" Ordinarily, this line might evoke laughter, but because of the way he says it, it doesn't.

There is nothing to love. The sub-title (""A Journey into Light"") is almost diametrically opposed to the truth of the story.

My VHS tape played perfectly, with no halts, fading, or extraneous background noises.",1222560000,13,1880,4.939873417721519
