This documentary stated that his contemporaries loved his portraits, but could not care less about Gainsborough's landscapes.  Maybe I'm not alone in devaluing that type of art.

The work stated that the painter often used wooden dolls as stand-ins for people and that's why some of his earlier works have people in unnatural poses.  The work is critical and calls some of the artist's oeuvre ""weak.""  However, they didn't point to one flaw that stood out to me.  Some of Gainsborough's human heads were too large and too oval to be realistic.  With that Colombian painter who creates all those fat people (Botto?), the viewer walks into it not expecting realism.  Here, however, I was seeing all these bobble-headed painters and couldn't understand why the narrator or the interviewees didn't point to them.

The work stated that Gainsborough had an intense rivalry with Reynolds, but they two had bonded greatly at the time of the former's death.  I don't know of any film that has tried to portray that, but it sure seems like it is prime material for a good period piece.",1211760000,,1206,4.8341463414634145
