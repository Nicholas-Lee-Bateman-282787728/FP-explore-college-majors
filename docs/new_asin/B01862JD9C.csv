8741550,4,B01862JD9C,"I bought this because I have an interest in Okinawan martial arts and I have seen some of this company's videos on you tube.  The first thing to say is that this will not play on a Region 1 DVD player, but it will play on an all region DVD player if you have one and on your computer if you don't. The screen ration is 4:3, not 16:9.  The music is all right but nothing to scream about.  The English narration is sometimes unintelligible due to the narrator's very thick French accent.  However, I did enjoy the video and will keep it in my collection. Very informative essay on various Okinawan martial arts with some very famous teachers and their students.",1484092800,,659,4.377049180327869
