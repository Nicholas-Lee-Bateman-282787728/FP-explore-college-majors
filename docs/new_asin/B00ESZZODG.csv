8609089,5,B00ESZZODG,This is a program about what a panel of experts considered the ten worst natural disasters known on planet earth.  I found the program quite educational.  One volcanic eruption may have triggered a mini ice age and the resulting food shortages may have contributed to social unrest such as the French Revolution.  This provides me with much fuel for contemplation.  National Geographic provides productions of modern unvarying excellence.  I am grateful to have been able to see this program.  Thank You...,1500163200,3,506,5.185185185185185

Oh, those are NOT natural, sorry.  Maybe just sea level rise over Florida golf courses.....?  Yellowstone megavolcano?",1488585600,,282,5.829268292682927
