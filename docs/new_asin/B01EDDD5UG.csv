PBS in the U.S. is showing this and many would buy the DVD if available in a U.S. format. It is a sweet look at human/animal interaction, a view of the intelligence and affection of these animals, and an important message to a species which has the ability to be a shepherd to the planet instead of a greedy killer.",1470355200,4,470,4.529411764705882
