8727651,5,B013HBLPF2,"Being a graphic artist, I had no idea about the role of women in the comic book industry.

This is both a strong cup of coffee and an inspiring documentary for anyone who loves this industry.

I had NO idea about the sexism that existed in this industry.  I guess, if I were asked what do I think about women in the industry, I would have probably thought there was no interest but boy would I have been wrong.

This is a phenomenal documentary and I'd recommend this to up and coming artist of both genders.

Informative and Inspiring.",1510963200,,536,4.373737373737374
