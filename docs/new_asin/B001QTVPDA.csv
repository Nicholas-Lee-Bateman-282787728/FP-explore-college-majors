8336260,1,B001QTVPDA,"This borders on Child porn. I do not recommend it. I started to watch it, I could not get though it,",1376006400,,100,3.8095238095238093
8336261,1,B001QTVPDA,"The first several pieces are awful. The Last Secret is well-intentioned but underdeveloped student projet. Quintessence features Craig Chester and not a single moment of it is believable... one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The Invitation is again a student film with an interesting premise but horrible execution. After that - two great surprises. The Blessing - a film about what appears to be a Mormon family - is terrific. And Our Father - about two black brothers discovering a secret about their father - has a great idea and succeeds despite limited technical frills. If you rent it, script to The Blessing and Our Father and skip the other crap.",1369008000,,661,4.807017543859649

8336263,1,B001QTVPDA,"Don't waste you time.  Bad all around.  Again,  not of the viewing quality I had expected from Amazon.  I guess I'm stupid,  thinking it will get better and trying again and again.  I guess I like throwing money away!",1358553600,,217,4.435897435897436
