4173266,4,B003R0MF08,"This is a great series, and we liked Season 9.  But the series seems to have peaked in season five or six.  I may just be my wife and I, but we jsut like a good mystery and the procedural police work around it.  Over time this series has developed several serial killers and crime syndicates, such as the Malla Nostra, that thread through multiple shows and keep recurring, and it gets a bit tiring after a while.  Still, we like the characters and the murder plots always seen interesting, if sometimes a bit over the top.",1478390400,,523,4.360824742268041

4173425,2,B003R0MF08,"The series is really starting to go downhill fast and the formula is becoming more and more predictable: early in the series we get the key bad guy(s) introduced and then these are slowly resolved through the duration of the season, ending with the predictable cliff-hanger (which, to be fair, was a fairly clever ending). But the series is just getting tiring, and even though I'm a huge fan of David Caruso he just seems tired, grouchy, and far more grumbly, and he's definitely gone off into a darker direction with the torture of prisoners? (Can he get away with that now that they arrested the grumpy IAD guy?) It seems like the writers are painting him a lot blacker than before, and in addition we seem to get less and less of him in the show. It's a shame, really. But Caine does appear, and he's got the amazing ability to teleport, apparently, as Wolfe and Delko are chasing a suspect they will run for miles and miles and then, ta-da, there's Horatio, ready to intercept with a gun aimed. How does he do that?

Also, I'm really not sure what's going on with Emily Procter's character in the show. Obviously she's hiding a pregnancy, using the old TV tricks to hide this, but that leaves the viewer wondering why through the entire season she never leaves a seated position. It's almost like they should have tried to write this in a little bit better. And I could be wrong but it looks like she's had some work done on her face, including botox? I can't help but see a gradual transition as she looks more and more like Stevie Nicks circa 1985.

There were a couple decent episodes but most of these were predictable and boring, including one episode that was a total ripoff of ""The Game"" movie. One more season to go, but I'm not really looking forward to what remains ahead.",1427760000,,1787,4.495384615384616
4173426,4,B003R0MF08,"I have just finished season 9 and started season 10.  Like the other seasons this one is chock full of good stories, action and of course violence.
As I watched them and compared CSI Miami with the other CSI series, I began to wonder why investigators were taking on the role of policemen.
CSIs job is to process a crime scene, not persue the nasty fellows committing the  crimes.  After the scene is processed, CSI or CSU studies the
evidence in the lab, while the police and detectives chase down the bad guys (and gals!).  This show and others take a lot of liberties with the real
facts though I suppose it does make the show much more interesting.  And I am still stuck with Delko, who other readers might note I do not like.
Kelly is ok (sometimes) and I do like Walter and  especially Ryan Wolfe, my favorite.  The rest of the cast is good, but as I near the end of the
series, I feel the cast lacks the likability of CSI NY (excellent) and CSI Las Vegas (excellent with Grissom, very good with Danson).  I rate this
series good to very good.. excellent stories, so-so likability of characters.  I do like the fact that Caine shows considerable sympathy and pain
for the losses to the victims families.  Delko is a hypocrite: in one episode;he roughs up this arrestee who had been pandering to whores.  Delko
himself (as a cop) cavorted with prostitutes in much earlier episodes and bought drugs from a street gangster.  And besides, he is creepy looking.
Apparently he has trouble with the ladies, except Kelly who seems to have drifted away from him a bit.  I call him ""Chipmunk Cheeks""!
  Never the less, this is still a very good series with some fine effects and photography.  I never been to  Florida, but I am impressed with the
beauty of Miami, though I don't think I would like  to live there.  Too flat and too much partying.  I will take NY any day (where I live), but
some of  the views are superb.  If this show didn't end in 10 seasons, I would suggest getting rid of those stupid ugly ass vehicles they drive.
I would like to have seen a bit more humor in all these series like the producers do with NCIS series.  Again, however, good stories with a
big cliff hanger at the end of the final tale. FOUR STARS Plus for this; I recommend this very much, and the prices for the DVDs are very
reasonable.  I got all mine from Amazon.  Cudos to WB for finally marrying off Patrick Jane and Teresa Lisbon in the final episodes of the
MENTALIST.  It was a good run but will be missed.  Enjoy!",1426204800,,2506,4.379609544468547

4173600,5,B003R0MF08,"I personally believe CSI: Miami was clearly the best of the CSI series of shows. I also believe CBS made a mistake when they cancelled CSI: Miami. The characters, the stories, and the continuing drama made the next episode a must see. I would rank CSI: New York as second, and the original CSI rated third. The original series just lost its appeal when key characters quit the show. I now have all 10 seasons of CSI: Miami in my collection and will always wonder what could have been!",1373068800,,484,4.449438202247191

4173621,5,B003R0MF08,"He's my favorite CSI investigator by far.  (This was my favorite CSI series after Warrick left on the Vegas series.)  Move over Grissom, there's a new man in town.

What I like about Horatio:
He's like Batman or Robin Hood.  He's a humanitarian at heart.
He's sympathetic to those who've earned his sympathy, and not so compassionate to those not worthy.
Provokes criminals, and always gets his man or woman.
Incites fury and wrath from hardened criminals - Memmo Fierro - the guy we love to hate.
He's always cool, calm, and collect.  Very sexy!
He's a great leader and has a commanding presence.

CSI Miami the good:
Every show has an ingenious plot that's sometimes ahead of known technology at the time.
The characters are likable, especially the lab technicians.

The Bad?  Absolutely nothing.  Well, you should have a strong stomach to watch the autopsies and crimes in progress.",1366416000,,885,4.846666666666667

Unfortunately,CBS recently cancelled the show. This is why I'm buying the series box set by box set. I don't think there will ever be a cop show as good as this one. I've been a faithful fan since this series started. The networks don't know a good winning series when they have one on television. This one lasted 10 ten seasons. The networks wouldn't recognize a hit show if it bit them in the ass! I hope that the cast of this series will get lots more roles,because they are major talents. I'm also hoping that the network that cancelled this show,will get it's head out of it's ass,and put this show back in production,so it can give us all more great seasons.",1338854400,3,814,4.326797385620915

It has evolved; added new and interesting characters; continuously developed its long-standing characters and has developed a look and mood that is more completely its own than ever. Its plots frequently go over the top but it is consistently entertaining and exiting. CSI Las Vegas needs to get its act together - the chemistry which its characters once enjoyed is just gone. Better make some real changes quick (Ted Danson and Elizabeth Shue, while wonderful actors, just don't click w/ each other or the rest of cast) or it will be in the ratings morgue w/ Dr. Robbins ready to pronounce the COD - ""Boredom.""",1333152000,,710,4.733870967741935

Although I feel the past seasons were somwwhat better, this was a good one; sans some of the scenes which were a little hard to watch, from a woman's point of view.

I hated seeing that handsome Jesse Cardoza get killed off, though.  Walter Simmons aced that scene playing the grieving best friend.
