8642181,5,B00II5BIZK,Do yourself a favor and skip the Hulu+ poor quality streaming of this show.  The color pallet combined with flawless 1080p make this one of the greatest looking shows I've seen.  Aquarion and Aquarion Evol are some amazing series and this DVD finishes the story in amazing fashion!  The story hits you with twist after twist and then puts a satisfying finish to the Aquarion story line.,1401148800,3,386,4.731343283582089
