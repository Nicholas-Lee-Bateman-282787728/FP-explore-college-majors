2736697,5,B000MLWQ6I,Awesome addition to my collection!!!!!!!!!  Worth purchasing and highly recommended.  Fast shipping from Amazom --- very pleased with this company.,1178668800,,147,6.3
2736698,4,B000MLWQ6I,"It's interesting to note that Season 4 suffers from the misfortune of having occurred after most of the original writers and producers for the show, including creators Anthony Yerkovich and Michael Mann, had long-since bailed and freelance writers were brought in to write for the show, most of whom had probably not even seen an episode of Miami Vice and had no clue how to write for the series cast. The result is an unforgiveably mixed bag of erratic episodes that are all over the map. The season opener ""Contempt of Court"" features great performances by Stanley Tucci and Meg Foster but it feels more like a mid-season filler episode than an explosive opener compared to Season 3's ""When Irish Eyes Are Crying"" but nonetheless gets the season off to an awkward start. By the fourth episode in, however, the season gets pretty much derailed beginning with ""The Big Thaw"" about a Rastafarian Michael Jackson reggae singer preserved in a cryogenic sleep chamber and then there's the infamous ""Missing Hours"" featuring James Brown and a whacked-out plot revolving around Trudy's alien abduction and it's time to call in Mulder and Scully instead of Crockett and Tubbs. If Vice hadn't already ""Jumped the Shark"" at that point, the introduction of Sheena Easton in the following episode ""Like A Hurricane"" as Sonny's recurring love-interest Caitlin Davies is enough to make you shriek like nails screeching on chalkboard when Sonny's lovey-dovey side reduces the season into a series of mushy soap-opera escapades and inevitable wedding bells ring while poor Rico is left on the sidelines. Then there's the throwaway ""flashback"" episode aptly titled ""A Bullet For Crockett"" which is nothing more than a series of clips from previous episodes including ""Evan"" from which the episode derives its name from as Sonny fights for his life after being shot in action, an oft-imitated television cheat which would be recycled again in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode ""Shades of Gray"" with Riker fighting for his life intercut with a series of episode flashbacks.  On the plus side there's some good cinematography and lighting this season and DJ looks good with his longer hairstyle and PMT looks pretty suave with his GQ beard and there's a pretty decent selection of alternative music featuring tracks by artists like Yello, Love and Rockets, Gene Loves Jezebel, Billy Idol, Iggy Pop, U2 and Peter Gabriel peppered throughout but any misgivings you may have about season 4 eventually payoff with patience building to the last two dramatically stunning episodes of the season, ""Deliver Us From Evil"" when Crockett's nemesis Frank Hackman returns to settle the score and ""Mirror Image"" with Crockett suffering from amnesia and believing he is his undercover persona Burnett (""That's B-U-R-N-E-double T"") that set the stage for the jaw-dropping season-ender and the three-part Burnett story-arc that continues into Vice's fifth and final season.",1177804800,21,2946,5.163179916317992
2736699,5,B000MLWQ6I,"When this season originally aired, I found myself with a social life so hanging around the dorm room to watch a TV show on a Friday night wasn't an option. I've been catching up on the later seasons thanks to Sleuth. This is one of the best crime shows ever made.

It's nice that Universal has dumped the double sided DVDs and is giving us 5 DVDs. These episodes look as good as the first two seasons. I'm eager for the fifth (and final) season.",1173744000,7,445,4.235294117647059
2736700,4,B000MLWQ6I,"Ok, this was a very strange, and often goofy, season of vice with some pretty good episodes and some very bad episodes.  sonny gets married and loses his mind (no, not at the same time).  the marriage to caitlin davies (sheena easton) is kinda hokey, and some think crockett's brain damage and subsequent reversion to burnett is hokey, but i really liked that story arch.  here's a summary of the eps:

contempt of court: geez, this is the season premiere?? a lackluster episode about a mob guy (stanley tucci) attempts to get to the witness that will testify against him at trial.  pretty dull...

amen send money: pretty funny episode with dueling television evangelists.  one of them accuses tubbs of rape.  i like the soundtrack of this one and it had some really funny moments...

Death & the Lady:  pretty good episode about a strange porno director that crockett and tubbs suspect has made a genuine snuff film.  crockett teaches him a lesson about the fact that violence isn't glamorous...

The Big Thaw: another goofy episode about a dead and frozen reggie star.  everyone is fighting over his body and izzie is involved in the scam. pretty funny stuff...

child's play:  a strange episode in which crockett shoots a child. the children's parents speak directly to the camera about the shooting and crocket agonizes about it.  the kid isn't necessarily the innocent victim he was first thought to be however...

god's work: esai morales returns as a potential heir to takeover a family drug operation but may be there for other reasons entirely.  pretty good episode in the scheme of things

missing hours: many fans HATED this episode but i liked the dream-like quality of it as trudy investigates a missing body from the morgue and has strange dreams (and encounters) with james brown, who is the head of a ufo investigation. nuggie, izzie and peanut butter are featured...

like a hurricane: ok, this is where sonny falls in love with sheena easton after agreeing to protect her in a payola scam.  sheena is actually pretty good in this and makes it more believable. some funny dialogue and she demands to drive his ""testosteroni"" and calls him the fashion police.  they fall in love and get married

the rising sun of death: castillo investigates the yakuza in miami.  didn't really like this ep.

love at first sight: caitlin worries about sonny's assignment in a dating service. iman comes back in this.  this is not a good episode...

rock and a hard place: two music guys try to expose sonny as a drug dealer to ruin caitlin's music career.  funny scene when they try to block sonny in as he leaves a parking lot

The cows of october: geez, what is up with this season?  this episode is also really goofy as a conman tries to sell supposedly mini-cow bull sperm to the u.s. and communists and izzy trys to broker the deal.  still, pretty funny stuff..

vote of confidence: the gang raids a rolling whorehouse (a train) and discover that one of the johns is a senatorial candidate <<yawn>>

baseballs of death: ok, now we return to the good, non-goofy, vice format as chase a chilean police chief that kills a hooker and is trying to buy small land-mines (the baseballs of death).  a funny scene when the chilean demands that ""this peasant (crockett) pick up my gun"" crockett: it will be a cold day in july pal!""

indian wars:  wow! a great start as american indians drop in on a drug deal with hawaiian chance, by yello, playing in the background.  tubbs goes undercover to learn more about the tribe.  he looks a little like ed bradley as he sports his glasses.  a good episode

honor among thieves: ok a really weird episode in which crockett and tubbs track down a serial killer that pumps little kids full of high-quality blow.  he is a high level drug dealer and crocket has to act as his lawyer in a trial set up by the other drug dealers. hummm, not to sure about any of this...

hell hath no fury: a lame episode about a rapist who is released and goes on the talk show circuit.  is he really rehabilitated or does he have something else in mind? does anyone care?

badge of dishonor: didn't like this ep. about a gang of bad cops who are hitting drug dealers.  crockett suspects a woman that is part of south beach special ops as being in on the hits.  i only watched this episode about 2 times...

blood and roses: another lame ep. in which gina gets way too close to a drug dealer.  crockett gets over-protective of her, but he's proven right in the end...

a bullet for crocket: ok, this ep. is called, ""we need to save money and/or we don't have any ideas..."" crockett is shot and the gang sits around the hospital room reminiscing about him, which means they get to fill this ep. with clips from all the previous episodes.  basically, a free episode for them to do

deliver us from evil: ok, now we get back to the good vice as crockett tracks down the guy he got out of death row.  great soundtrack (finally!) and great plot. also, no more sheena easton! very contraversial ending among the fans as they try to determine whether sonny's shooting of the suspect is justified.  could the shooting have been where sonny became burnett for good (before the explosion in the next ep)

mirror image:  really good episode in which sonny barely excapes an explosion from a boat, which triggers amnesia and crockett to believe that he is really burnett.  he goes to work for a drug lord and is very effective.  my theory is that he couldn't take the pain of being crockett anymore after the death of his wife, and the explosion on the boat was nothing more than an excuse to lapse into his burnett persona. he's really good as burnett and ruthless. its the few gems in this season such as this one that make this set worth buying.

overall, a somewhat poor season of vice.  even at its worst, vice is better than other tv shows though.",1169683200,66,5858,4.566218809980806

2736705,2,B000MLWQ6I,"Season 4 was arguably one of the weaker, if not the weakest of all the five Miami Vice seasons.

Season 4 was when it had gotten through to the producers that season 3 and its change from light-hearted hedonistic glamorization of tropical criminal life to dark, gritty problematization of human casualties of crime was unloved by fans and TV critics alike. So what do you do when you realize that you've taken a former hit TV show into a direction that got almost universally panned? You try to return to giving the public what they want. Out went the dark earthtone suits, the dark guitar rock music, and many of the nihilistic storylines. Only, that wasn't enough to revive Miami Vice's former magic. Michael Mann had left the show, Dick Wolf was increasingly goofing off with it (and still says that ""Missing Hours"" was one of his favorite episodes to produce), and Jan Hammer was also preparing his escape from television. Much of the same was true for the show's original writers and directors. Even with the reintroduction of pastels, contemporary pop music and more light-hearted elements, the show just didn't seem well put together anymore. Instead of returning to the path of virtue and all the things that had made it great, it increasingly became a caricature of its own self, ever more desperately trying to appease its once loyal viewership. Miami Vice had fallen behind the curve, it was no longer trailblazing 80s pop culture. It was when you suddenly just looked silly wearing pastel colored clothing or coyping any other element that used to be so quintessentially ""Vice"". Even your Ray-Ban Wayfarers were suddenly unfashionable. On top of this, story arcs like Sonny Crockett's brief marriage to Caitlin Davies or the Sonny Burnett amnesia cliffhanger felt more contrived than actually remotely believable, and lighter episodes like ""The Big Thaw"", ""The Cows of October"" or most infamously ""Missing Hours"" just drove the nails ever deeper into the show's coffin.

If you buy this box set, it's best to avoid episodes like those altogether. But to be honest, really good episodes are so few and far between that it's difficult to argue against the idea that the season 4 box set is just a waste of money.",1467417600,,2222,4.875661375661376

2736722,4,B000MLWQ6I,"I do not like this season - there are some silly episodes like The Big Thaw where a
reggee star's family fight over his estate and his frozen body, Missing Hours (U.F.O.s and
James Brown??), The Cows of October (fighting over bull semen?), and Amen. . .Send Money.
There are some gems like God's Work, Rising Sun of Death, Death and The Lady, Love at
First Sight, Badge of Dishonor, Hell Hath No Fury, and Indian Wars (some of my favorites).
I did like Sheena Easton as Caitlin Davies (a woman who would not fall under Sonny's charm too
easily at first) but I wish that they would have dated more and not gotten married so soon.  Worth

2736779,2,B000MLWQ6I,"I am a huge fan of Miami Vice.  HUGE.  And I own this season on DVD.  I own all of the seasons, so this was a must have in order to complete the collection.  But for the life of me, I cannot fathom how anyone could give this season a high rating.  I think many are rating it high simply because it is Miami Vice.  At least, I think it is.  Then again, when I watch this season, it really makes me wonder...is this the same show I grew to love in seasons 1 and 2 (and parts of 3)? Because it sure does feel like a totally different show, with no link to the earlier years.

Here's just some of problems:
-  Miami?: Most of the scenes are set in dark, fog-filled garbage-strewn alleys or dimly-lit rooms.  Where's the Scarab?  Where's the St. Vitus?  Where's Elvis?  Heck, where's a palm tree?  How about the South Beach strip?  Or any beach, for that matter.  How about some ocean?  Or a sunset?  Watching this season, you would never even know it takes place in the fun and sun of Miami.  If not for the use of pastel neon lights, this season could have been Detroit Vice.
- Music: Where did the mainstream pop music go?  When one thinks of Miami, they think of dancing, laughing, partying, etc.  Seasons 1-2 captured that (season 3 tried at times, but failed in comparison to the first two seasons). In season 4 however, the soundtrack goes into the obscure hard rock, industrial and goth.  Huh?  Was this a budget issue?  I mean, I like the Jesus and Mary Chain and The Smiths too...but in Vice?  Come on.  Since when did South Beach get so depressing?  Even most of Jan Hammer's tracks were recycled from earlier seasons.  No wonder he was smart and found the quickest exit door at the conclusion of this season.
- Budget: Clearly, there were some serious cuts.  Many of the scenes look cheap and contrived.
- Season Opener: Vice was always known for a gripping season opener.  The pilot was groundbreaking.  Season 2, Crockett and Tubbs hit NY in a classic two-hour opener.  Season 3 we see the Daytona blown to smithereens.  However, in this season we get 'Contempt of Court' -- an episode largely filmed indoors -- in court and in jail.  No fun & sun here.  More like a 'Law and Order' pilot.  With a poor storyline.
- Death: Want an indication of just how dark this season got?  No less than three episodes have the word 'Death' in the title -- 'Death and the Lady', 'Rising Sun of Death' and 'Baseballs of Death'. Give me a break.
- Crockett AND Tubbs?:  You know, the best part of the first three seasons is watching the relationship develop between Sonny and Rico.  In season 4, Sonny takes the lead and most of Tubbs' lines revolve around some semblance of the word 'yes'.  Rico grows a beard and just fades into the background.  Only in 'Child's Play' do you get a hint that they even know each other well.  Coincidentally, 'Child's Play' is one of the few decent episodes this season.
- 'Missing Hours': Was this Close Encounters or Miami Vice?  Where was the QC?  An outright embarrassment.  I know people who, when Vice was must-see TV on NBC, never watched another episode after sitting through this nonsense.
- 'The Cows of October': Western-themed music throughout this episode?  Wait, this IS Miami...right?
- 'The Big Thaw' and 'Vote of Confidence': Both are unwatchable, but still better than the two previous eps mentioned.  Who approved these to make it into the season?  I mean, this isn't even bad writing.  It's atrocious.  I wonder if the actors knew, while they were filming, that the series was rapidly going down the tubes.
- Sheena Easton: A bad singer.  A worse actress.  Did the producers think that SHE would save the show?
- Testarossa:  Yes, I know its a real Ferrari.  Big deal.  Yes, it's slick.  Beautiful.  But it lacks the class and style of the Daytona.  It has no character.  Just like this season.

In all, I give this season two stars.  Season 4 is when the heart and soul had been ripped out of the series.  Despite the dark title, 'Death and the Lady' is worth a watch.  'Child's Play' is excellent and makes you wonder what the rest of the season would have been like if the producers and writers injected a little more humanity into the characters.  'Deliver us from Evil' is a good follow-up to Season 3's 'Forgive us our Debts', which leads into the season-ending arc.  That's four episodes worth watching.  The rest is abysmal.  Never before had one season derailed a hit series so quickly as Season 4 did to Miami Vice.  And never since.  It's a real shame.",1312761600,20,4510,4.477188655980271
2736780,5,B000MLWQ6I,"Switek is not very visible most of the time this season, although the ladies get a lot more screen time, and the Lt. gets at least one storyline devoted to him. Even Tubbs seems to take a back seat.  The focus of the show was always Sonny, and this time, he dresses in a lot more neutrals, his hair is longer and prettier, we don't see Elvis, and he suffers more damage to his soul and mind after things go horribly wrong for him and his lovely new wife, Caitlin.

There is also one really dorky episode called ""Missing Hours"" which does not work on any level.

The rest of it, though, is compelling.",1299369600,,600,4.245614035087719
2736781,4,B000MLWQ6I,"Miami Vice is to me (a new fan) one of the best shows ever made with its first three seasons.  The first two exemplified a new style, but remained a focused and well made television show that transcends its famed style and was a great show.  The third season made things a little darker and a little more real, losing the style to a certain extent, most likely hoping to establish itself as a show with substance over style.  With season 4, the show was at a bit of a cross-roads, strugling greatly with the chance to be taken more seriously beyond the label of MTV Cops.  The focus was less team/partner oriented and more single character based (usually), and the popular songs are greatly toned down.  While it turned up some winners, it turned up some clunkers as well.  With the clunkers the problem was repeating already established themes and stories (crokect not wanting to testify, Gina with men in...poor situations), as well as stories that were just plain silly (cryo-frozen jamaican?).  However, amongst this was some really great episodes, and some real surprisingly dark turns.  Crocket went darker than I ever expected, and did it surprisingly well.  Ultimately, this season still was fun, and easily recomended for Miami Vice fans.  Though flawed, with some clunkers, it was still fun to watch, and I can't wait for the fifth season.",1287705600,3,1349,4.800865800865801

They were ahead of there time. So thats my thoughts  ta ta!  Give you all a tip....if you don't like it don't bother....,1265068800,,497,4.15625
2736785,4,B000MLWQ6I,"By the time the fourth season of MV appeared in the Fall of 1987, the show had peaked ratings-wise (second season) and creativity-wise (arguably the previous season).  The writers were new, and it shows.  Our favorite stylish cops are put in some new and strange situations.  This is a pretty mixed bag compared with previous seasons.

There are a number of noticeably weaker episodes this time around.  Some seem half-finished, never taking advantage of a good idea.  Examples include Rising Sun of Death, dealing with the Yakuza in Miami.  The plot is completely confusing, and by the climactic swordfight(!) and hari-kiri, I didn't much care anymore.  There's also a requisite flashback episode when Sonny gets gunned down and the cast wait in the hospital while reminiscing on past seasons.  There's the cryogenically frozen reggae singer whose body the Vice squad winds up trying to safeguard from scheming factions.  Then there's the whole Crockett marriage to Sheena Easton, who plays a version of herself.  This unlikely romance sets in motion the season-ending cliffhanger (first time on the show) which takes things down a dark path.

And perhaps the most reviled episode, often voted worst ever, is Missing Hours.  This is a sci-fi episode of sorts where the partners investigate strange reports of alien abduction involving...Trudy and James Brown!  Or is there a quite logical but non-public explanation?  I actually thought it was kind of fun to watch the cast in a non-standard situation, having fun with the conventions.  It's definitely strange, it ends strangely, but as for 'worst episode of any show ever'...I would not be so harsh.  When you crank out 100 episodes of any drama, expect a clunker or two.

The season begins strongly, with the return of Stanley Tucci as Gotti-esque gangster Frank Mosca.  Pity they don't keep him around, though, and the violent ending comes with no coda at all, which was becoming a regularity on the show.  Then Brian Dennehy makes a tremendous guest appearance in a 'ripped from the headlines' episode as he plays a televangelist who may or may not be shady.  Another popular theme (to this day) appears in Death And The Lady, about a popular artists whose foray into 'erotic performance art' may or may not contain murderous elements.

More so than previous seasons, the endings in Season Four are cynically twisted or nihilistic, with no afterthought to the deception or violence.  One gets the sense that the show's characters (and writers) were feeling the wear and tear of the Miami underworld (and of coming up with plots for 20+ episodes).  In true late-80s fashion, things get grittier and grittier amidst the neon and soft focus.  This perhaps echoes the sentiments around the 'War on Drugs' and the increasing frustration with fighting an inexhaustible supply of dealers and product.

The show was never about police procedure, which explains the consistent holes and flaws that presumably exist to keep certain 'elements' of style and posing in place for the weekly viewer.  For instance, though Crockett and Tubbs are undercover...they consistently show up at crime scenes AS cops, but in their undercover outfits and cars, in front of crowds of onlookers and even the media.  And they're always hanging out at the police station, which is supposed to be discreet...but nobody notices the white Ferrari that appears there every day?  They do overt cop work while in their undercover clothes and cars...I don't get it.  Way too many people learn that they're cops for the facade to survive for this long...not ONE criminal has leaked their personas to the underworld?  They don't change their appearance or names?  Again, too much thought for what was supposed to originally be 'MTV cops'.

The box set is bare bones, with zero extras.  (The only MV set with extras was actually Season One).  Part of the delay in release was the clearance of song rights for the many tracks used in the many episodes.  Also, in contrast to Seasons One and Two, these episodes do not even have mini-menus with a synopsis of the episode (when you click the episode you want to watch, it goes straight into the prologue/intro).  Which is all fine, I guess.  The show looks good, though with a bit of grain, particularly when stock footage is used.  Thankfully, there are sub-titles for deciphering names and various lines that are muttered.  Given the wide availability of the set at decent prices, the box is still a good value.

Highly recommended for the MV fanatic, more casual fans should check out the previous seasons (just start with the original).  While the show is cemented in the collective conscious as being an exercise in style (most associated with the clothes), it was a lot better than folks think, and has proven very influential to this day.",1247616000,5,4809,4.96
2736786,3,B000MLWQ6I,"This 1987-88 Season of MIAMI VICE was only a so-so season and the season when this police drama started going stale & was starting to lose their touch since they seemed to have run out of ideas to make this show interesting to watch along with the fact that this is the season when Crockett's wife Caitlyn(Sheena Easton)dies off, plus the ratings were starting to fizzle too and you could tell that this show was going downhill and that Don Johnson(Crockett)and Philip Michael-Thomas(Tubbs)were getting tired on top of that, especially Don Johnson along with the fact that MIAMI VICE was obviously no longer in its honeymoon phase of the show anymore on top of that.

Therefore less and less people kept tuning in to watch this police drama every Friday night during MIAMI VICE's last 2 seasons on NBC along with the fact that this was probably the second weakest season of them all throughout MIAMI VICE's whole 5-year run on NBC since this show was obviously already running out of steam, despite Don Johnson's sexiness along with the fact that Don Johnson was a sex symbol and a teen idol back then before MIAMI VICE's cancellation on NBC in the Summer of 1989.

On the other hand, it was interesting seeing guest stars like
*Ben Stiller in the ""Amen...Send Money"" episode before he became a star

*Steven Keats in the ""Contempt Of Court"" episode before his co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN

*Brian Dennehy known for his co-starring role as the hellbent Sheriff in the original FIRST BLOOD aka RAMBO I

*Rosanna De Soto known for her co-starring role as Mrs. Valenzuela in the movie LA BAMBA guest starring in the ""God's Work"" episode

*Isaac Hayes in the ""Child's Play"" episode

*Esai Morales known for his role in the movies LA BAMBA and BAD BOYS and his co-starring days on NYPD BLUE guest starring in the ""God's Work"" episode

*James Brown in the ""Missing Hour"" episode

*Jan Hammer doing a cameo appearance in the ""Like A Hurricane"" episode

*Singer Sheena Easton in the episodes ""The Rising Sun Of Death"", ""A Rock & A Hard Place"", and ""Deliver Us From Evil""

This season of MIAMI VICE also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""Come On Home to NBC"", which was NBC's motto from the Fall of 1987 thru the Summer of 1988 along with the fact that I was 15 years old and a Freshmen in High School over at Central Union High in my hometown(El Centro,CA)at the time.",1245888000,2,2396,4.60093896713615

If you watched and enjoyed the TV show, I don't know what I can say that you don't already know.  Technically, the video and audio quality is very good.

Watching Crockett and Tubbs speed across the screen in that white Testarossa while listening to those old Phil Collins ('In The Air Tonight') and Glenn Frey ('Smugglers Blues') songs... what more could you ask for?  :)",1217635200,3,677,4.455284552845528
2736790,4,B000MLWQ6I,"This season did not have the look or feel of seasons 1-3 and just felt different but it is still a lot better than Season 5.

Jan Hammer sharing composing duties with John Peterson and reducing the amount of music in the show was not a good idea and it made Miami Vice seem like any other cop or detective show without the music.

The last 3 episodes A Bullet For Crocket, Deliver Us From Evil, and Mirror Image most resembled the earlier Miami Vice shows with the music brought back in the scenes.

Antonio Fargas in Mirror Image was one of the most disturbing and interesting villains in the series.

Also it was a bad idea to introduce Sheena Easton as a love interest.

I think they did this to counter Dallas on CBS so they wanted to add a soap opera element to the show to attract more female viewers.

There are a lot of quality actors and stars showing up in guest spots like Stanley Tucci, Brian Dennehy, Julia Roberts, Ving Rhames (second time he appears as a guest star first was in the Maze), Philip Baker Hall, Ben Stiller, Alfred Molina, Esai Morales, Chris Rock, James Brown, James Hong, Iman, Oliver Platt, Michael Wincott, and Antonio Fargas.

The heart and soul that was seen in every episode of 3 is not seen in one episode of the pathetic Season 4. Don Johnson who expressed one hell of an ego in 3 and looked so cool in every episode in dark stylish, expensive threads. In Season 4 he looks absolutely silly in his cheaply made clothes.  I think he got most of his clothes at the nearest swap meet. He also looks bored and tired, just like the viewer is, when watching this garbage and thinking when is Miami Vice going to come back.

2736795,4,B000MLWQ6I,"Sometimes, this season is considered the weakest season but in my opinion it features many of what would be my favorite episodes. The first few episodes are rather run of the mill - though ""Amen .. send money"" is a great episode but is different to other MV - and certainly ""The big thaw"" is terrible, but ""Child's play"" and ""God's work"" are very strong and inventive episodes. ""Missing hours"" is often cited as the worst episode of all but while this is clearly not MV in style, it is the kind of stuff people would be watching later on ""Twin peaks"" or ""X-Files"". I like the Caitlin Davies episodes (Crockett's revenge on Frank Hackman - that episode is one of the best ever MV episodes imo) and ""Mirror image"", where Sonny loses his mind after his Caitlin's death. ""Bad of dishonor"", ""Indian wars"" and ""Hell hath no fury"" are great action-packed episodes. The anti-Pinochet episode ""Baseballs of death"" is not only fiction but shows the kind of people the West supported against communism (this is the best political episode since ""Stones war"" in season 3).

The only problem with season four is there are about 4 very pointless episodes (the boring ""Vote of confidence"", the ridiculous ""Cows of October"" and ""The big thaw"" and - if you want to - ""Missing hours"" (the strongest of these 4 actually!)) that sometimes were back to back.

2736797,4,B000MLWQ6I,"Season 4 may not be Miami Vice at it's best but it's still way better than the movie and also way better than law shows we have these days. Give me Miami Vice over Law & Boredom anyway. The most exciting thing about that show is the....""Dung Dung"" in the opening. This season of Miami Vice has a silly start but a solid ending. In the beginning you have Crockett and Tubbs given silly missions with less of the action that us fans love. I mean you have them watching over a frozen body in one and an episode possible alien abductions for god's sake. You also have a silly but entertaining episode with 2 tv preachers feuding and Crockett and Tubbs caught in the middle.

  So it's obvious that they ran out of ideas during this season but it's still not bad at all. Probably the strongest is where Crockett accidently shoots a kid and he decides to look up his ex and their kid to be a father figure again. But it's not going to be that easy since his ex has a new guy in her life that wants to adopt his kid with Crockett totally shut out. So their is some good drama this season.

  I do think that Crockett falls for a singer that he's supposed to protect way too quickly though. I mean they get married in the episode where he just met her. But that leads up to something good too. Crockett has to deal with the publicity of being married to a famous singer and it makes her look bad when it's put in the newspapers that he's a drug dealer. Since a reporter uncovers Crockett's history as his undercover identity Bernett. Crockett with a new wife also leads to a solid episode before the season finale though. Plus we get a different side of Crockett in the season finale as well when he loses his memory and thinks he actually is Bernett. It may be a bit unrealistic but it's still a very cool cliffhanger of an ending for the season. It's also not that silly compared to a lot of the other things from this season either. Hell I even love the 3 episodes where Crockett thinks he's Bernett and acts like a ruthless criminal, it's good stuff. To get the other 2 episodes like that, you need season 5 of course.

  The season also offers some excellent appearances by Chris Cooper, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Chris Rock and James Brown ""Rock and Brown both appear in one of my least favorite episodes where Trudy has been drugged"", Ving Rhames and Stanley Tucci also appear in different roles than they had in previous seasons.",1184025600,,2432,4.3392070484581495

The mobster who killed Sonny's friend is freed from prison. Yeah, boring...but at least it is not ridiculous like most of the season

A Bullet for Crockett 1/2 star
Members of the vice squad reminisce and hope for the best as Sonny lies near death from a gunshot wound

Deliver Us From Evil ***1/2
A murder that hits close to home reunites Sonny with the man who used him to trick his way off Death Row. Part 2 of one of my favorite MV eps from season 3, glad to see Crockett get his revenge.

Mirror Image ***1/2
A concussion from an accident while undercover during leaves Crockett believing he is drug-dealer Sonny Burnett, and he goes to work for a Colombian crime boss
