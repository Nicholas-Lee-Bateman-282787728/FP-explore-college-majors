8458977,5,B005603290,"I've watched this show since season one and I have learned more in one hour of TV than I ever did in school. The detectives get an item linked to historic events, such as wars or people through out history, and they track the back story. Through computer searches, library archives and relatives of the subject, they get to the historic nature of the search. They then try to verify if their item is indeed from the source that it is claimed to be. By the end of the segment you learn if it is actully real and the history behind the story. If you want to get your children intrested in history, get them this DVD. It is one show that I hope never goes off and keeps me entertained for years to come.",1322006400,4,700,4.192592592592592
