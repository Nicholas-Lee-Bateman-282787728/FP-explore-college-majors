5104059,4,B007PVHBCC,"This is an awesome show! Incredibly informative and fascinating. The biggest question I have is - where is the rest of season? There appears to be only 10 episodes on this DVD set, however the Travel Channel's website lists over 20 for this season.",1360454400,,248,4.659090909090909
5104060,5,B007PVHBCC,"I have enjoyed the ""Mysteries at the Museum"" on the Travel Channel. Many people in our valley do not watch the Travel Channel. So I purchased these to entice and stimulate interest in viewing the program.",1359590400,5,204,4.694444444444445

5104063,5,B007PVHBCC,"I love this show.  I am a history buff and have found that this show is not only entertaining but very informative.  Not only have I learned things I didn't know, I have also learned the true story behind certain events such as the Great Chicago Fire.  This show takes viewers into museums all across the country (both famous such as the Smithsonian and small, unknown museums) and profiles a particular object, sharing the actual story concerning the object in addition to addressing commonly held beliefs about stories such as the Great Chicago Fire.  I have enjoyed both seasons of Mysteries at the Museum on DVD and have watched season three on the Travel Channel.

My only complaint about season two is that the DVD contains 10 of the 12 episodes that were aired on TV.  What happened to the other two?  The episodes that were left off the DVD were episode #6 (Aldrich Ames mailbox/Belle Gunness) and episode 8 (The real battle of LA/California Venus).  I hope that the producers will include these two episodes when they release season three on DVD and hopefully that will be SOON!!!

I wholeheartedly recommend this show to anyone who loves history.  Believe me, you will be surprised at the information that is presented.",1342051200,12,1229,4.781990521327014

5104080,4,B007PVHBCC,"This series is great for all people! History buffs, educators, military, and anyone who likes to learn about how and why everyday things have come to pass. There are 2 discs with about  6 episodes each; each one of those episodes includes 4-5 different mysteries.

5104094,5,B007PVHBCC,I didn't know half of this stuff was still around or where we could see it.  I love the show and all it shares with you.

5104095,5,B007PVHBCC,"I purchased this and the first season as an early birthday gift for my mom. She was delighted with it. If you love history, mysteries, unusually stories told extremely well, this is for you. Best part~no commercials compared to watching it on tv or on-demand.",1394582400,,259,4.777777777777778
5104096,5,B007PVHBCC,"This is one of the best shows on television, especially if you love history.  The show takes you to various museums across the country - both well known like the Smithsonian, and smaller, lesser known museums - and then focuses on a specific item in that museum's collection and explores the story behind this item.  Sometimes the story is well-known and sometimes what we believed to be the truth is nothing more than urban legend. One example of this concerns the Great Chicago Fire which most people believe was caused by a cow kicking over a lantern but this show explains what really happened and how the myth of the cow came to be ""fact"".  I have found all 5 seasons of this show to be absolutely fascinating and an entertaining way to learn about our history!!!",1390953600,2,768,4.591240875912408
