8518913,5,B007K7ICE2,"I've been an anime fan for many years but had only heard of Golgo 13 from afar or in what little info. I was able to garner from those 2 Nintendo games and a brief history of the character in an old issue of Nintendo power. When I saw the TV series on Anime Network 2 years ago I became a fan after the first 5 episodes. A new episode came out about every week but I couldn't wait that long so I went out to buy the 2 animated movies (The Professional & Queen Bee) and Volumes 1 & 2 at the store. I'd been looking for Volumes 3 & 4 so I just got them here on Amazon and it worth the wait.
Like most great anime characters, Golgo 13 has an extraordinary ability that makes him endearing to fans of the genre. In his case, superhuman sharpshooting skills & a very sharp awareness of everything around him that makes him the greatest sniper/assassin who ever lived. However, he's more of an anti-hero than a hero because he'll shoot anyone (good guy or bad guy) for any client (good party or bad party) for $3 million and has said that he doesn't need to hear any kind of moral justification for him to carry out any hit. So although he's often called the Japanese version of James Bond, Golgo actually has more of a moral ambiguity about him but that's what makes Golgo who he is. He's neither good nor evil; he applies his craft to whoever pays him for it and doesn't betray him. He's an assassin with a sense of honor which makes him unique.
Just don't stand behind him if you value your life.",1407369600,,1493,4.16955017301038
8518914,5,B007K7ICE2,Golgo 13 is probably one of the most under appreciated anime series ever created. The action and fight scenes are never dull and the animation is on point. Recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the series.,1375747200,,207,4.333333333333333
8518915,5,B007K7ICE2,"Love this series. Sometimes this is a fantasy action movie where I wish I was the actor. Sometimes the movies looks dark, but it set the mood for what might happen. I will buy all the series this has to offer.",1353196800,,209,4.121951219512195
8518916,5,B007K7ICE2,"Golgo 13 Collection 4 marks the end of two things: the Japanese television series DVD set, and the mathematical narrative pattern that hitherto was as dependable as the eponymous hit-man's face is stolid.  For those familiar with the series up to Collection 4, the pattern follows, in several respects, the formula of the detective novel, where the narrative is more about elucidating the solution to an overarching problem that the genius protagonist has arrived at long before the lay observer.

For the man with the custom M-16, that problem is meeting the demands of his client who invariably proposes a feat for ""the only one who can make an impossible dream possible.""  Like any long-running series, the law of main characters governs, and there never is any doubt that Mr. Togo will complete his job and stylishly walk off into the distance.  The stoic sniper leaves to others the talking, which unsurprisingly means that most of the character development comes from the clients and those that surround them in their contemplation of Golgo's task or their poetic comeuppance.

That all changes in Collection 4.  For the first time, Golgo is genuinely taken by surprise-something that the far seeing-and near clairvoyant-Asian seldom lets happen to him, if ever before.  Never in one collection did Golgo ever show more humanity, weakness, and his own blood, yet still come out on top.  It's in the clash of steel and sinew that we finally learn more about Duke Togo.  This man was always an enigma.  Now you'll know he's an enigma at the bottom of an abyss.",1337644800,10,1564,4.91254752851711
