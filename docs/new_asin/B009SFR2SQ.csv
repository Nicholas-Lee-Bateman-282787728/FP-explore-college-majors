5363997,3,B009SFR2SQ,"fun at times, the story goes fast paced at others, some situations appear and disappear without much following or explanations. Everthing seems too simple without much consequences.
It's basically a light comedy. The characters lack a little more humanity, they all seem detached and absorbed in their own lives without much concern about the others.
But still, I enjoy it. The acting is good and the photography too.",1378684800,,417,5.147058823529412
5363998,4,B009SFR2SQ,"As much as I love French romantic comedies, I should have learned the language by now.  American romantic comedies are generally about a beautiful/young professional meeting a wonderful guy/gal who's ""beneath"" his/her social standing. But in most French romantic comedies, the characters are mature - meaning older-, and love wine, good music and baguettes  Ooh-la-la, this comedy is no exception. It's funny, tears at your heartstrings with its good, sensible plot and has the perfect ending. Caught myself smiling when I turned off the TV :)",1377216000,,543,5.3023255813953485
5363999,3,B009SFR2SQ,"Sometimes funny...Sometimes boring, bard to believe plot but I do like the actors and gave it three stars for entertainment,could have done without all the bad language....",1376697600,,172,5.407407407407407
5364000,5,B009SFR2SQ,"actors are excellent, the plot is a bit expected (cross-class tales) and lacks a bit of verisimilitude  but it works well thanks to the three wonderful actors that serve the main characters and in the end, art redeems the whole thing so it is a very pleasing film which actually tells a lot on French social stratification and ideals of ""respectability"" ....",1370908800,,358,4.774193548387097
5364001,4,B009SFR2SQ,"Isabel Huppert is great as always. If you don't know her, you been living a drab life. Sinks her teeth into a part and never lets go. This story brings out the beast in her, but also some sad realities. Try it, you'll like it.",1370649600,,226,4.044444444444444
5364002,3,B009SFR2SQ,"She's a great actress, Huppert, just the whole movie doesn't do her justice. A light movie for a boring summer afternoon, that's about it.",1369872000,,138,4.791666666666667
5364003,2,B009SFR2SQ,"Mostly of interest to check out the current French idioms (haven't much changed in the past N years, but may be that's also because of the age of the characters). Way too stretched reality wise - or not enough. So a bastard type of a movie - as I said, interesting to watch just for cultural curiosity.",1368835200,,302,4.315789473684211
5364004,5,B009SFR2SQ,"Many funny surprises and twists to this movie. It a  great movie to watch with someone you love.  Open up the bottle of wine, relax and enjoy!",1368230400,,142,4.222222222222222
5364005,5,B009SFR2SQ,"For the first 15 minutes of so of watching this new French film, starring the incomparable actress Isabelle Huppert I was wondering what I was getting into. The frenetic pacing and the obnoxious character played by actor Benoit Poelvoorde was making me nuts and I was ready to quit. But then things changed and, all of a sudden, I was drawn in and really cared for the characters. And, if you like offbeat French comedies - or independent films (both are the type coming from Strand Releasing) I think you'll like this one two. Huppert is not known for comedy but she has fun here. The story is basically how two individuals who have virtually nothing in common (he's a loud mouth slob; she an art dealer who is ""cold as ice"") find something in common. I won't reveal more of the plot - and I hope other reviewers refrain from this too - as it will spoil the fun.

The 100 minute 2011 film is the kind that the French do best. It's in French of course and the subtitles - while in white - are still pretty easy to read. The dialogue, especially in that first 15 minutes, is hectic so you may need the pause button here. But generally you should have no problem.

The DVD contains the original theatrical trailer - which, oddly enough, has subtitles twice the size of those in the film - and other Strand trailers. That's it for bonuses.
The supporting actors are also wonderful and I liked how the story took directions you don't expect.
Another small ""gem"" that I'm glad I discovered - and didn't give up on. Consider those 15 minutes a ""set up"" and then enjoy the ride.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5364016,3,B009SFR2SQ,"This is very much character acting, and I suppose that is what I don't like about it. It is a caricature of personality types to the point where it is no longer funny but the characters just grind on your nerves. I am not sure how I watched it all.",1397088000,,248,3.98
5364017,4,B009SFR2SQ,J'aime le film Mon Pire Cauchemar. A funny story about a very unlikely couple. She's a very wealthy businesswoman and he's basically a homeless contractor and an alcoholic. They meet through their sons who are classmates and friends. They both learn what's important in life when they become romantically involved.,1395964800,,314,5.3
5364018,4,B009SFR2SQ,What a delightful little film.  I came upon it by chance and was pleasantly surprised.  I really wasn't sure what to expect.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and always love French scenery and style.  It was smart and funny.  Like another reviewer mentioned.....don't let the first 15 minutes keep you from watching the whole thing.  It's not a waste of time.,1394841600,,358,4.786885245901639
5364019,5,B009SFR2SQ,"There you have it: rich woman, poor lost man who drinks. But it is so different than what Hollywood would have concocted that it is a refreshing look at life in another way. Most of what happens there would probably not fly in American society... let alone getting married for ... (just watch the movie!)",1391990400,,304,4.545454545454546
5364020,3,B009SFR2SQ,"The two leads are quite marvelous comics. Huppert's glacial bitchiness does one up on Ann Bancroft or Ida Lupino, yet stays somehow humanized. Her Belgian partner  ditto, despite his over-the-top vulgarity. But forget about the plot premises: the satire of the contemporary art scene is shallow and the ""Taming of the Shrew"" sexism marginally offensive. I find it hard to believe that the director is a woman.",1391817600,,409,5.104477611940299
5364021,4,B009SFR2SQ,"Very entertaining movie!  If you want to spend an enjoyable evening, watch this subtitled movie.  You won't be disappointed if you are looking for a comedy.",1390003200,,156,4.961538461538462
5364022,3,B009SFR2SQ,"This romantic comedy depicts a typical cross-class motif, where an established art dealer falls for a vegabond, flaky male character. Typically, this type of movie would earn one or two stars in my book.

However, Ms. Huppert's acting and Mr. Poelvoorde's delivery redeem the movie. Other redeeming qualities -- including the character development and the  secondary plots (re: the relationship between Francois and Julie, and re: the children's relationship)-- make this movie worth the time.",1388188800,,493,5.56
5364023,4,B009SFR2SQ,"The basic set-up is standard Hollywood ""boy meets girl, girl hates boy, boy and girl live happily ever after"". But of course, this isn't Hollywood and the movie winds up covering ground well beyond the standard rom-com tropes.

I'm no expert on French cinema, but I've noticed in this and some other French films I've seen recently that they have this odd (to me) two-part structure. In one other I saw, the first half was primarily dramatic, but the second half took a decidedly surreallist turn. In ""My Worst Nightmare"" it's nothing so bizarre but still...the first half works quite well as a simple comedy, while the second half dives deep into the personalities, relationships, and personal challenges. Not that all those themes don't run throughout the movie, but there seem to be definite differences in prevalence between the first and second halves.

Or, maybe, I'm just not adept at watching French films and it takes me half the movie for my brain to catch up and really understand what's going on. Either way, I think it's great. :)

Anyway, throughout the movie there are plenty of easy, uncontrived laughs, and yet it's telling a very real story of imperfect people and their struggles: with each other, with themselves, and society in general. These are characters you can care about (though frankly the kids get pretty short shrift), especially in the way they are honest with themselves and mature (well, mostly...when they're sober) in their handling of issues between each other.

An American film telling the same story would probably at a minimum have all of the characters yelling at each other all the time, talking right past each other or, worse, getting into physical fights. Those films are mostly illustrations of how _not_ to live your life.

""My Worst Nightmare"" manages to be funny and suspenseful, all while showing characters that at least some of the time are setting a good example for dealing with one's problems. A more entertaining morality lesson would be hard to find. :)",1385424000,,2010,4.9174041297935105
5364024,3,B009SFR2SQ,This movie started well with some good funny moments but fizzled out a bit towards the end and lapsed into a corny ending.,1380412800,,122,4.3478260869565215
5364025,5,B009SFR2SQ,"Different from the trite American humor. One of the things that I like about this movie is that people are not afraid to show their human side, to be childish without being idiotic. The story and the characters could have been better developed, but I wasn't expecting much from a comedy. It was just for laughs.",1379030400,,311,4.571428571428571

8544096,1,B009SFR2SQ,"I could not even finish watching it.  from the beginning it was sooo lame.  I got it bc i was attracted to the story line.  regarding my subject heading--i am pretty good (semi-fluent) in French, so the primary language of the movie did not bother me.  It was the plot not even taking off, the lack of interaction with the characters... and so much more!!",1441670400,,355,4.415384615384616
8544097,5,B009SFR2SQ,Refreshing and funny. Well done - actors and director and the entire film crew. It reminds me that everything is best shared and in its authentic form.,1437868800,,151,4.62962962962963
8544098,4,B009SFR2SQ,"Insubstantial and predictable rom-com, but both Huppert and Poelvoorde are stellar and multidimensional as the two protagonists. Nice way to spend 90 minutes.",1428192000,,158,5.913043478260869
8544099,3,B009SFR2SQ,"It was good.  I don't speak french and I purchased it to help me learn french.  The plot was expected, and the outcome was too.  Now I can't really commit on the dialog because of my deficiency in the French language but I enjoyed the movie.",1414886400,,241,4.195652173913044
8544100,4,B009SFR2SQ,"I think most might not care too much for it. Unless like me, you like the quirkiness from french movies, something different that from most American movies.
