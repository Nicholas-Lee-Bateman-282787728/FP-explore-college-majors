8308719,5,B001HEILWW,"Need i say more? Turisas is a great Finnish metal band, and this dvd is full of extras. Almost all of the songs i love are on here live.",1342828800,,136,3.7241379310344827
8308720,5,B001HEILWW,"Sure, the band Turisas are entertaining live, and the live performances on the DVD are good. But the real gem of this DVD is the documentary. From showing you traditional Finnish customs, to clowning around and how they prepare for each show, Turisas does a great job of telling you how their summer went. Even Mathias' Finnish history lesson is educational and funny.
I really enjoyed, surprisingly, the narrator telling you what's going on or filling dead time. I would expect this is a history or nature DVD, but to add it here - really makes for a top-notch production.
I own about 70 metal DVDs, and this is easily the best one at getting you behind the scenes.
Even if you're not a huge Turisas fan, this is still worth picking up.",1230422400,6,737,4.548872180451128
8308721,5,B001HEILWW,"This was a wonderful DVD! The documentary is very well-done. It is entertaining, funny, and very informative about the band. I learned some stuff I really didn't know before and I've been listening to Turisas for a long time. It's nice and impersonal at times, and by that I mean you get a good look into the band off-stage. Shows how they get ready for shows, what they think about touring, and shows their midsummer celebration! There are also a lot of live performances on the DVD, which is wonderful as well.

Overall it has a good mixture of Turisas and Finnish history, live performances, and humorous situations. Recommended for any fan of Turisas.",1228435200,7,655,4.745614035087719
