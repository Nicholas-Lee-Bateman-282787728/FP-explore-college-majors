8298646,1,B001ELGZEY,As a long time visitor to Cape Cod this is not about the Cape Cod I know.  I simply gave up on the film after twenty-five minutes or so.,1506211200,,136,3.689655172413793
8298647,5,B001ELGZEY,"I haven't felt this good about a movie since watching 84 Charing Cross Road. Even though Radio Cape Cod is fictional
and there isn't a book, it is real enough for those who watch it, and I hope that the writer and director of this movie will write a book with his sequel tie ins, if this happens, I shall die a happy woman!",1395619200,,323,4.0625

8298649,4,B001ELGZEY,"I'm Tea Lady's husband and we have a different perspective on the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the pace presented which emcompassed the environment, the town, the people and human nature. I thought the director did a very well balanced job of portraying the slow, sensual existence of a varied community. I had a sense of calm watching the film and appreciated the flow of harmony and symbolism between the characters and their ocean-centered township. Personally, I valued less dialogue and thought the drama class quite novel as an expression of man's energy being in tune with man's environment. Well done!  P.S. My wife, Tea Lady, encouraged me to post this review as a balance to her opinion.",1249171200,,696,4.948717948717949
8298650,3,B001ELGZEY,"I call this, `A Tale of Two Tamzins' because these two fine, English actresses who play mother and daughter - both named Tamzin - carry the film.  But in truth, the movie is a love story - not between people - but of the ocean. Tamzin Merchant says in the `Interview' portion of the DVD, that the sea is a character. Actually, I think she has it spot on.  The sea is *the* character of this picture.

I sought out this film for the other Tamzin, Outhwaite, whom I have enjoyed watching for over a decade on `EastEnders' and `Red Cap.' She plays Jill, the protagonist. Tamzin Merchant plays her daugher, Anna.  As Joe Wright, the director of the movie `Pride & Prejudice' says of Tamzin Merchant (who plays Georgianna Darcy in that film), Miss Merchant is a genuine person. This still holds true in `Radio Cape Cod.' Miss Merchant embodies the character of the child angry at her mother for moving on after the death of her father, while simultaneously entering into her own blossoming first love.

Andrew Silver, the director, explains in the `Director's Comment' section after a mother/daughter argument along these lines: ""What happens after conflict? Resolution. These characters empathize and adjust instead of amplify conflict.'  Very true. However, in this film, you must remember that the only character is the ocean.  There is very little dialogue and what exists is confusing and inept at best. In fact, I had to watch the film again under the `Director's Comment' section to really understand what was meant to be going on as well as watch the `Interviews' with the cast.  It is unfortunate, but the best spoken scenes are the one in which the director says the actors improvised.

The scene I relate to the most is the one in which Tamzin Outhwaite cries while she is in the studio recording a program. It is much like Rachael Ward (as Meggie Cleary) crying while at the ocean in `The Thorn Birds.' The ocean is eternal and will take our tears, then refresh us with hope and renewed energy to go back out in the world.  A+ to Ms. Outhwaite for her performance. The two Tamzins are subtle and their acting sublime because they must emote powerfully to overcome the lack of dialogue and story exposition.  There is too much that is symbolic and difficult to understand for the general viewing audience.

However, this film is a postcard to the lush scenery and local music of Cape Cod itself. The film won a cinematography award and it is easy to see why.  The director uses ocean scenes to denote the change of day. My favorite is the moonscape (which actually was filmed during the day and the cinematographer was somehow able to make it look like a night-time shot. Lovely!)  The local music flavors the scenery throughout the film. If you want a sensory experience, just look and listen.

The director/producer clearly loves his subject - Cape Cod.  As `Jill' says: ""The world begins and ends in love and unexplained affinities.' Yes. The love is the love of the ocean. The unexplained affinities are the lackluster stories of the characters' interactions. The movie clocks in at an hour and 20 minutes. It could easily have been enhanced another 20-30 minutes with more character exposition and development.  I would give it 5 stars for the English actresses (doing a lot with very little!), the scenery and music, but only 1 star for the script. So, that puts it at a '3' overall average.",1247961600,,3403,4.7116357504215856

Fagbenle. A wonderful energizing story of love and human connection. Directed by Andrew Silver. Voted Best Cinematography ' All American Film Festival.</a>

Radio Cape Cod is an uplifting summer film that focuses on the importance of relationships and harmony with one's environment. The
story follows a quartet of couples over the course of five days, and
beautifully illustrates how their respective relationships blossom over
time. Each character has his/her own idiosyncrasies, which make them
easy to relate to, as if they're your friend from down the street, or
someone you knew in junior high.

Enough praise cannot be given for the cinematography in this film. The
seas surrounding Cape Cod come alive with the playfulness of the waves,
and the skies, alight with sunshine, smile from behind wispy clouds.
Wonderful attention was given to the score as well, and the entire film
has a tremendously warm feeling of a summer in love. Julian Silver is
definitely an up-and-coming young actor to watch for over the next few
years.

Well done!",1219795200,2,1445,6.758064516129032
