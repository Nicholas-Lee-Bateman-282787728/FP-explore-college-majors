8482352,1,B0041DVGBE,"As Al Perkins i did not buy this disc, nor do i review it.
As owner of 2 masterpieces from this particular artist who keeps lauding himself in broken english in amazon and in his many posts on the forum of blu-ray.com, i advise all music lovers to stay away and spend their money on real audiophile recordings like AIX records or 2L, just to name 2.
Pls take the time to read the comments of his 5 star reviews and 1 star reviews and you will be much wiser.
This guy is using the internet to multiply his sales by shamelessly publishing (copy pasting) fake 5 star reviews under aliases (none of which have bought  the disc on amazon, all are using the same broken english) and trying to discredit any rightful 1 star reviews.
However he is using all the right keywords in the title of his discs to ensure they show up first in any search for high definition /audiophile/ DTS HD ... music.
DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ARTIST, WHO KEEPS MAKING FALSE CLAIMS AND IS THE PROUD OWNER OF AN AWARD OF WHICH NO TRACE EXISTS ON THE INTERNET, EXCEPT IN HIS OWN CLAIMS.",1309651200,11,1049,4.297979797979798
