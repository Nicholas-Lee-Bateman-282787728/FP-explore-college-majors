8298888,3,B001EN3CZC,"This program was OK, but spent less time on the history of exorcism and more time on three particular exorcism stories.  A brief history of the idea of evil or a ""dark side"" was discussed, followed by the transformation of that idea of evil into a singular presence, i.e. ""the devil.""  Finally, it was a small leap to the belief that, if the devil exists, and it wants your soul, it could possess a person as a means of taking that soul.

From there, the program shifts to three Possession/Exorcism stories:  one from the early 1900s, the famous 1949 case from which the book and movie ""The Exorcist"" was based, and a modern-day example, where the viewer is shown scenes from the ""deliverance"" that was performed by a Southern Baptist minister.

I was hoping for more discussion on the general topic of exorcism, with perhaps more emphasis on pre-modern times (Middle Ages etc.).  As mentioned earlier, there is not much of that in this program, which focuses primarliy on the 20th century.  Still, it is a decent place to start, although you will want to look elsewhere for a more thorough treatment of this topic.

Three stars.",1220227200,,1129,4.695431472081219
