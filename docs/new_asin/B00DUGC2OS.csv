5856559,4,B00DUGC2OS,"I was looking for short but effective workouts. I was thinking about Beachbody's T25 when I saw this. So, I thought, what the heck and pre-ordered it. I even looked at few of the workouts on YouTube and thought it was worth a shot. And, I'm glad I did. This is a very well organized system. There is a different set of workouts for each day. And, you don't need to go through and select the workouts you need for a particular day. Each DVD has ALL of the days pre-mixed by month, week, and day. So, All you really need to do is push play. I like both of the instructors. The routines are easy to follow. My one problem is the lack of modifiers for some of the high impact moves. But, I've done enough workouts to know how to modify it for myself. Overall, a great investment.",1380067200,29,775,4.173333333333333
5856560,5,B00DUGC2OS,I learned about this product thought the free befit90 videos on youtube and and it works. Liongate has the most amazing coaches and fitness trainer. Samantha Clayton and Garret Amerine are awesome.,1379894400,3,197,5.1875
5856561,5,B00DUGC2OS,"I'm only 3 weeks in on this program, and I'm already seeing better results than I have with any other program I've done including P90X. With 5 35 minute workouts per week, it does not drain my schedule, and each workout is well rounded. The package came in perfect condition.",1464480000,2,275,4.52
5856562,5,B00DUGC2OS,"great workouts. perfect amount of time, great for strength building.",1443744000,,68,5.9
5856563,4,B00DUGC2OS,"Arrived on time, it wasn't damaged and looks exactly like in pictures. I was SWEATING! ! The moves are not difficult,  it will get your heart pumping n you will get tired. I give it 4 stars because after one month I got bored with it, but I did finish it and did see changes in my body. If you're not ready for a 90 day commitment don't buy it",1437091200,,343,3.9
5856564,4,B00DUGC2OS,"My husband is actually using this program.  It's a good workout in only 35 minutes, which is nice when you are a little short on time.  He usually adds the elliptical for some additional cardio.  He has knee issues and has to modify some of the exercises.  He has been doing it for a month now and it seems to be keeping his interest.",1427155200,,334,4.171875
5856565,3,B00DUGC2OS,I still like the 30-day Butt Lift better.,1409270400,,41,4.25
5856566,4,B00DUGC2OS,"Great workout system. I love the trainers as they make it fun. They have helped me to get into better shape. I cannot say how much weight I lost or inches as I didn't make notes of that, but it did increase my endurance and my stamina. The workouts vary, you have yoga,mma,weights,cardio,plyometrics,etc.you can follow the videos day by day for the 90 days(3 dvds),or you can mix and match. I still go back to them often when I get tired of some of my other workouts. I would highly recommend this for beginners and advanced people as well.",1408406400,2,540,4.4646464646464645
5856567,3,B00DUGC2OS,"I bought this looking for something challenging to follow the Supreme 90 day system that I had just finished. And while it is a good workout it is not long enough, each workout whether its cardio, strength training or yoga is just 10 minutes long and for me that is just not long enough. They should make a followup set that's 20 minute sessions with maybe shorter warmups and cool downs! In order to get my moneys worth I have decided to add this to my other daily workouts using the yoga and cardio and MMA sessions and so far that seems to be working.",1402963200,4,554,4.285714285714286
5856568,3,B00DUGC2OS,"It is a good workout, it has good cardio and strength aspects, I just don't really care for the trainers, Samantha is annoying, in one part of the DVD she says, ""I don't know about you but i hate fat...""  and the guy is really hard to understand-but this could be my tv I guess. I found the speeds of some exercises to be off as well, some that should have been done at a slower pace were sped through, like some of the weight lifting moves, and others were a little slow, like some of the cardio moves. Overall though, if this isn't something that would bother you, it is a good workout and a good deal for the price.",1401667200,3,618,4.107438016528926
5856569,4,B00DUGC2OS,"I'm currently in the 11th week out of 13 and I have to say that I highly recommend this workout.  The routines really are a mixture of plyo, yoga and cardio with a healthy dosage of strength training. Unlike some other 90 day workouts, there is no dread factor here. The videos range from 32-35 minutes with a warm-up which is the same for the entire month.

I like that fact that the videos are affordable and short time wise.  The negatives for me include some awkward packing (especially in the MMA portion).  The yoga is fast paced so if you are new to yoga then you might want to skip it and find a slower yoga video.

I find that month 3 has a lot more cardio and can be high impact so if you have joints that are a problem, I would skip it.",1401321600,,747,4.089041095890411
5856570,5,B00DUGC2OS,Was considering purchasing this but then saw they are available for FREE on YouTube! Every single one. Just wanted to pass that along :),1396483200,27,136,4.708333333333333
5856571,4,B00DUGC2OS,"I am almost through the second month, and really like the program, especially the strength training. I have lost a lot of weight but don't really consider myself 'in-shape' (better shape than it was, however) so I do struggle with the cardio routines. I will admit that I skip the yoga routines because they are too fast paced for my comfort level. The stretching routines are great, so I only gave it four stars because of the super fast pace of the yoga portions Overall I am glad I bought (it's a great variety of workouts for $20!) the DVD set.",1396396800,2,548,4.435643564356436
5856572,5,B00DUGC2OS,Love this workout duo. Great exercise.  Different variations  so you won't get bored. Also very entertaining. Thanks again  More videos will be added to my library,1391472000,,163,5.1923076923076925
5856573,4,B00DUGC2OS,"I hate to review this so soon as it's only been a week since I've started the workout, but so far so good. I would only reccomend this to people who are already in decent shape, that or just take it more slowly than I did. My shoulders have always been one of my stronger areas due to bartending, etc.  and I pulled something in my deltoids on like day 2 that's not feeling too great. But aside from that, I love the way each day is different, and look forward to (hopefully) progressing with the DVD",1390435200,,500,4.154639175257732
5856574,4,B00DUGC2OS,"I have done many programs such as P90x, Insanity and Tapout and was looking for something a little easier. This program would be great for people who are just starting an exercise program. It would be a great starting program to get out of shape folks ready for the other programs I have done. The instructors are very personable and explain things well. There is nothing too fancy or complicated and does not require a huge investment in equipment. A very good program for beginners that I can recommend whole heartedly.",1390435200,4,521,4.736263736263736
5856575,4,B00DUGC2OS,"I was looking at various 90-day workout programs and picked this one based on reviews, price, and that the routines are only 30 minutes.  I'm in the third week and so far I'm satisfied.  I'm only on the first disk but so far here are my comments:

1) The warm-up routine is the same every time, but that's not an issue as I improvise.

2) Intensity level is about right for me.  This is not for uber-beginners, nor people that blow through P90X or Insanity.  I'm a late 40's male in decent shape (play tennis, run 5K's etc) and wasn't looking to come out of the basement dripping in sweat and exhausted. I can follow along and complete everything except having to cheat a bit on the ""mountain-climbers right into burpees"" portion of one of the cardio units.

3) To get the most out of the program you'll need hand weights.  Curls, front and lateral raises, and flys are part of the program.  I use heavier weights for curls and lunges, and lighter weights for raises.

4) I'll probably get bored with this after about.........90 days!  But that's the point.  After this I'll move on to something else.

In summary, I think its a pretty efficient workout for general health. Toning, strength gain, and weight loss (you can't exercise your way out of bad eating!) are to be had too, depending on how hard you work, but for me that's secondary.

UPDATE: I finished the first 2 disks only skipping 4 days due to travel.  Disk 2 got slightly more intense, but disk 3 is much more intense with fast plyo - even the sculpted men and women begin to get winded and sweat on disk 3.  The routines begin to become boring after about 30 days...then it's on to the next disk.  I still think its a good program considering price and 30 minute efficient workouts.",1389398400,31,1748,4.4637223974763405
5856576,4,B00DUGC2OS,"Well I am 36 days in and going strong. I really like this program. The two trainers are not irritating (ok the female is slightly but its bearable) and I have never been unbearably sore like with most programs. I am losing weight by doing the daily workouts and calorie counting and I can see great definition happening. I really enjoy doing the work outs because they are not overwhelming and I know that after two sets we move on. Only gave 4 stars because I do add additional cardio since these are only 30 minutes long and I want more calorie burn. I plan on finishing this program, and am excited because this is the first time I haven't quit a few days in or whined and skipped days because I was sore. I really recommend this, especially because the price is so good.",1388016000,5,774,4.344827586206897
5856577,4,B00DUGC2OS,Great Deal -  Although I am only in to the first two weeks of the workout I found them to be good and inspiring. Well worth the low price I paid for them.,1385942400,3,154,3.6666666666666665
5856578,2,B00DUGC2OS,"I've read the other reviews for this product and it looks like I am the first to have something negative to say.  Let me preface my review by saying that - to each their own.  Whatever works for you is great!  Everyone is different, especially when it comes to fitness.  For me, this system was a let down.  I did not like the trainers, especially Samantha.  Her pacing was strange in several segments.  Some of the workouts were hard, some were easy and I never felt like I found the right balance.  I love cardio but didn't care for the cardio in this system.  I haven't seen the results I expected - toning being foremost for me rather than weight loss.  I also expected more muscle definition.",1385078400,11,697,4.417322834645669
5856579,3,B00DUGC2OS,"Great system, different work out everyday. Great execution. However, it is not for beginners. If I were more fit, I would give it 5 stars. It should be for someone who wants to rev up what they're doing a couple of notches.",1384646400,5,223,4.333333333333333

8597913,1,B00DUGC2OS,The workouts are ok. I use them in addition to another DVD. The instructors are extremely annoying. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. You get what you pay for.,1520899200,,163,4.655172413793103
8597914,5,B00DUGC2OS,"I own over 200 workout dvds, and workout daily.  I love this set, and was so pleasantly surprised by the very affordable price.  I was expecting both an amateurish production and trainers.  Was I ever wrong!  This is very professionally done, and the 3 dvds offer so many options.  Really, I'm just delighted I decided to purchase this, after waiting a long time, because I was skeptical of the low price.  Beachbody and other overpriced workout collections are charging you for their commercial airtime on TV!  So, don't be fooled by how affordable this is.  I totally recommended buying this wonderful set of workouts!",1504828800,3,620,4.894230769230769

8597919,5,B00DUGC2OS,"Great great system; I highly recommend it! The host of the DVD are engaging and the workout do an excellent job getting you in shape. The exercises are straight forward and can be done in a half-hour; what I like most about this DVD system is that it gives you that the workouts of the day  and they are broken up into chapters. Thereby, giving you the opportunity to get some water and towel off before the next round. This set-up also has the benefit of giving you motivation to finish that days work because you know exactly how close you are to being done. With each round being 10 or less minutes, the workout as a whole goes by quick and I've definitely seen results and Iam someone who works out 5 to 6 times a week in addition to job where I am on my feet moving throughout the day. So 30 minute workouts  from BeFit are perfect and you're not going to find a better system for less money, it also comes with all kind of diet plans, recipe etc.... I don't use that, but it is great they have it just in case.",1472860800,2,1016,4.152284263959391
