8522805,5,B007X59966,"I have newly discovered Ray Winstone and love him! He is an astonishingly good actor, with amazing versatility, in this and the three other features I have watched and enjoyed with him as star: ""Vincent"", ""Darkness Falls"", ""Moonstone"". ( Started, ""Five Seconds to Spare"", but didn't go far...WAY too topically weird for me.) Where have I been to have completely missed him until now?
Overall, I thought this unusual, charming and fun, ALL characters definitely, ""characters,"" drawn and played quirkily well by each. I am sorry to write or think it, but in my opinion some of the other reviewers here are at least a trifle bit snobby with their negativity.
Ok, here I go to catch some more Winstone on my Prime!!! ",1518393600,,713,4.796747967479675

8522809,2,B007X59966,Slow moving. Lost my interest pretty quickly.,1505001600,,45,5.571428571428571
8522810,3,B007X59966,"This film just didn't 'grab' me. It wasn't bad, had some humor and was beautifully shot, but somehow it left me untouched. It wasn't the story - there are plenty of movies that turn a bad story into a good film that's fun to watch. It wasn't the acting - there is plenty of good talent here. Maybe the pace, or style. I can't put my finger on it...",1503705600,,348,4.057971014492754
8522811,3,B007X59966,So many good actors - wasted by poor writing and direction...too bad.,1501632000,,69,4.833333333333333
8522812,4,B007X59966,"Good flick! Based on a true story!!!? Looks true to me....well, I think Ray plays my dad. He sadly passed away 2 years ago (my dad). Yes, some of it is true  but  a lot was added...or were they???  Anyway, sort of fun. Not too much for me tho... the daughter. Little sad. Oh well, that's what life was back in those days. Over now.",1454630400,2,331,4.061538461538461
8522813,3,B007X59966,I will watch pretty much anything with Ray Winstone in it  and this was ok.  Based apparently on a true story  you can't fault the story line if its what happened  however it was a little tongue in cheek  and not funny enough to make it GREAT  but it is quite entertaining,1437436800,2,272,4.134615384615385
