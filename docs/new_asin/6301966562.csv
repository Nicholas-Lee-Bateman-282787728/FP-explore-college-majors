Although some of  the situations (and technology at that) may seem far fetched, the problems  facing Miles, Edgar, and Madeline are ones that we all have faced sometime  in our lives.

391762,5,6301966562,"Same movie I loved when growing up. Great and inventive music. Classical influences right on the edge of the more electronic style shine through beautifully. Miles is no computer genius, but that's kinda the point. He's an average intelligent user who is getting used to the technology just as it comes alive on him and goes farther than normal. The Music + Movie are beautifully in sync at providing the message of moving into the new world while not leaving the old one behind.

I'll leave the acting front to other critics. Miles is pretty reclusive/awkward naturally and the Computer is just learning it all, but the story is definitely structured in a way that all characters feel like they reach their moments naturally. Especially making up after the fight, which is rare in movies in my experience.

Saw some notes on a remake, but we're a bit too deep in the tech to provide that same message again. Not to mention that I would have no idea what music they would amaze with as a crossover from old tech to new. Part of the charm comes from its dated status and that computers were just coming into the world at the time. The same couldn't be done with smartphones, siri, or VR, which are natural extensions of what everyone understands",1488412800,2,1244,4.624434389140271

391827,4,6301966562,"Electric Dreams is a science fiction romantic comedy and dramatic film will that tells the story of a love triangle between an male architect,a female musician and a personal desktop computer. It stars Lenny Von Dohlen, Virginia Madsen, and the voice of Bud Cort as the computer. The setting of this movie directed by Steve Barron is at San Francisco.

Architect Miles Harding falls head over heals with her beauteous neighbor musician Madeline. But later,he learns that he already has a rival in winning his heart - a personal computer named Edgar apparently owned by Miles. Upon hearing Madeline playing cello,Edgar composes his own tune and plays together with her. It impressed Madeline thinking that it happens to be Miles and they get to know each other by going on out of a date. This makes Edgar jealous that he starts to take over Miles' electronic appliances such as the TV set and radio. In addition to that,he also makes life miserable for Miles through more ways than one like pissing the dog for it to bark constantly and making him uncomfortable while using the computer.

The movie definitely shows it age as we get to see how extremely old the desktop computer was considering it does not use a Graphic User Interface (GUI) as an operating system and when the internet wasn't yet available to the general public. Also,the visual effects were definitely old as Computer Generated Imagery(CGI) was still many years away. The story between Madeline and Miles were definitely cliched and formulaic and escapism remains a common theme when it theatrically released. But nevertheless,it introduces us to the endless capabilities of computers and the idea of artificial intelligence which will become a common theme for many movies to come in the future. The soundtrack was memorable as well as many songs were extremely popular like ""Together In Electric Dreams"" by Phil Oakey,which continues to be part of the encore performance of The Human League during their concert as of now. Overall,it remain a delight to view especially for fans belonging to the 80's generation.",1427414400,,2082,4.997118155619597

Since you're probably already familiar with the film, I'll just say it's a wonderful movie and I love it, and stick to some of the technical details that confuse a lot of people.

First, this film was never released on DVD here in the U.S. Therefore, if you want a copy of the movie on DVD you have to get a copy that was released outside the U.S. Namely Europe.

Here's where it gets confusing for some people...

For technical reasons I won't delve into here, when DVDs are released around the world, they can be digitally restricted to only play in certain regions, and not others. Hence the term 'region codes' when talking about DVDs.

Here in the U.S. (Region code 1) we use a video formatting system called NTSC. Whereas in Europe (Region code 2) they use a different video formatting system called PAL. These two systems are not compatible with each other.

So, because most of the Electric Dream DVDs you'll find here come from Europe, they will be Region 2 using the PAL formatting system. This means they will not play in most DVD players sold here in the U.S. (Although there are some exceptions)

Here in the U.S. most DVD players can play only Region 1 discs formatted in NTSC. However, there are some higher end players that are Multi-Region and can convert PAL to NTSC. If you have one of these players, as I do, then you will be able to watch the movie just fine. Check the specs of your player to be sure.

My personal situation...

I ordered my copy from a seller in Italy. The disc was Region code 0, meaning it was Region free. But, it was still formatted using the European PAL system. Therefore, even though it was Region free, it would not play in one of my DVD players. However, it was able to play in my other one, a high-end Oppo DVD player, which is capable of playing both NTSC and PAL formats.

When I took it to my girlfriends house, her new Panasonic Blu-Ray player would not play the film, so we just played it on her laptop using VLC Media Player, which worked just fine. We connected the laptop to the TV with an hdmi cable and it looked wonderful.

So here is my recommendation...

If you want a copy of this movie on DVD, then just order one. Don't worry about the region code or the formatting. If your DVD player won't play the movie, then just watch it using your computer or laptop. It should be able to play just fine on a computer. Then, just patch your computer/laptop to your tv, and enjoy!

If it does not play using Windows Media Player, simply use another media player such as VLC Player. If you're not familiar with VLC, it's a very popular media player that can play almost any media file known to man. Then, just plug your computer to your tv using an hdmi cable, and there you go.

Anyway, I hope this was able to answer some of your questions. I will try to add a video review if I have time so you can see the disc I received from Italy. I'll also attach some photos.

Hope that helps...",1357084800,7,3348,4.859402460456942
392102,5,6301966562,"Even though ""Region 2"" meant this Electric Dreams DVD couldn't play by default in either my DVD player or using Windows Media Player on my computer (all purchased in the U.S.), VLC media player from videolan.org played this Electric Dreams DVD on my computer with no issues (Media / Open Disc...).

With a little extra work, I was also able to get VLC media player to convert the DVD to an unencrypted media file (Media / Convert/Save... / Disc tab).  NOTE: I just created a new profile with the ""MPEG-TS"" selected on the Encapsulation tab, ""Video"" & ""Keep original video track"" checked under the Video tab, and ""Audio"" & ""Keep original audio track"" checked under the Audio tab.  I named the file with a "".ts"" extension.

After VLC media player produced that "".ts"" media file, I then used ffmpeg from ffmpeg.org to convert that media file to an audio and video format that was more useful to me (i.e. H.264 video and 2 channel AAC audio in a MP4 container for my smart phone):

ffmpeg -i ""input media file.ts"" -ac 2 ""output media file.mp4""

Note: The "".mp4"" extension on the output media file ensures that you get all the other default MP4 settings.

However, when I loaded it on my DVD player, I was disappointed to find that the picture began to ""roll"" like the old ""vertical"" adjustments on the old style TVs.  This was common in the early days with black and white TVs but extremely uncommon with the modern flat screens and there is no adjustment to correct it (at least I don't know of one...)

392181,5,6301966562,"My wife and I saw this film when it first came out in movie theaters.  What an absolute gem.  Whoever thought up the idea of a romantic triangle between a boy, a girl and a computer, was a genius.  Edgar (the computer) becomes jealous of Lenny who, in a shy manner, is trying to woo Madeline (played by beautiful Virginia Madsen).
  The magnificent soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder (Flashdance) makes the film worth it.  I immediately rushed out and bought the sound tape.  In one gorgeously inspiring scene, Edgar and Madeline play a duet of ""Lover's Concerto.""  The song was popularized by the Vogues but this instrumental version is aurally stunning.
  Edgar's problem is that Madeline thinks the unseen other half of the duo is Lenny. The concept that a computer, which traces its lineage to a TRS 80, can have human emotions might seem laughable, but the movie pulls it off brilliantly.  In fact, when Edgar comes to the realization that he can't have the girl, viewers get misty eyed at his sad departure. However, the ending is very upbeat.
  For some odd reason this movie didn't do well at the box office but it is almost a cult classic as far as I am concerned.  Hopefully, one of these days it will be released on DVD.  Till then, you can watch several key scenes by going on Youtube.  The famous duet is titled ""The Duel.""",1335312000,6,1331,4.576271186440678

When the original contracts were drawn up for the music used in the film, they negotiated for film distribution, vhs distribution, and possibly television distribution.  However, when it comes time to release on a new format like DVD, they have to re-negotiate again to use the music.

Sometimes, the record labels, bands, and/or songwriters play nice in the negotiations and the DVD comes out right away.  Other times, it turns into a major battle and holds up the release forever.  Occasionally, the company that owns the rights to the movie (but not the music) will just replace the music with different music and release the DVD.  A good example of this is the original DVD release of ""Sixteen Candles"".  Read some of the reviews here on Amazon and you'll see tons of people complaining about the songs that were changed.

Ok, the plot line, about how a simple accident turns the computer Miles buys for work into a sentient creature who falls for the same girl downstairs that Miles does, is a little silly, but the characters and the story move along and by the end you are as happy as the characters all over the world who are hearing the same song on radios and TVs EVERYWHERE (remember there was no Internet yet), and dancing up a storm.

The ""Duel"" between the girlfriend (who is a cellist) and the computer upstairs (she thinks it is Miles) as they jam together is wonderful- the Giorgio Moroder music is a plus, and another level is the wonderl, nostalgic '80s style to the whole film.

The computer (Cort) was excellent in representing the learning curve and speech patterns of an adolescent AI. They have all been insultingly underutilized in an industry that prefers to mass-produce all too many lemons and reruns.
I don't know any of the actors listed in this Amazon offering, but the original movie and its cast were just that ... original, vastly under-rated, delightful and amusing. Don't scorn the graphics. They may seem primitive today, but they are totally appropriate to this movie, and in context quite lovely. The music is energetic, well chosen and performed, and supports the plot.

My appreciation for classical music began with this movie and I always looked forward to seeing it come on TV back in the day. For those still waiting like myself there is hope. The film is in production to be remade. I know, your immediate initial response is probably ""Oh, no"", but wait. There's a positive side to this. First off, Virgina Madsen herself is producing the picture with her new production company ""Title IX Productions"" along with her partner Karly Meola. Ok, fair enough. The star of the original is making the retelling happen. That could be promising. What's even better is that she hired the original screenwriter, Rusty Lemorande, to pen the new script. So, Virginia is involved AND the person that was responsible for the original story is back to help recreate it. That adds up to a possible slice of awesome coming our ways if it happens.

Now, what does that mean for the original? It gives it a real chance at being recognized and receiving its due credit as a great film from the 80's (which are the new 50's by the way), and having a remake in theaters usually tends to help a once forgotten film finally hit the DVD and now Blu-Ray shelves.

Now, in the new millennium, I tried to come back to the film, which is really hard since there are only VHS copies and online sites for this film. I did manage to see it again in full, and for the second time, I was in awe with this movie. This is an 80's film with a typical 80's MTV style.

392409,5,6301966562,"I loved this movie ever since watching it as a kid. I happened upon it at the local video rental store, when I was all of 8 years old - I was immediately drawn to the cover art, which clearly depicted the premise of a ""living"" computer, amidst a (then modern day) romantic comedy.

I grew up tinkering with computers and listening to classical music. I'm also a self-taught keyboardist/musician, and I'm well too familiar with the part of the lovesick, hopeless romantic--more than I'd like to admit. So I'm not sure if this movie appealed to me because of these things, or perhaps even had an effect in becoming the person I am today. Who knows?

The thing I do know, much to my surprise and comfort, after recently watching it again, as an adult, and after having never seen it since, through the eyes of that little 8 year old boy, was that his movie still held up to my present day expectations. I was worried of course, because of how some of your childhood favorites don't always hold-up to the memories you once had of them, when you try to relive it again.

This movie astonished me. It was still able to make me laugh, and even shed actual tears - something I don't even recall doing as a child. I do remember the laughter, though!

Perhaps, in some ways, it's even more relevant to me today, then it was back then; in broad terms, maybe, in personal terms, there's no doubt.

In short, if there is such a thing as a soul, this movie could fit mine like a glove.

I don't normally write about anything, and the last time I did, it was for Electric Dreams in February 2006. This film from the 80's brought about the subject of artificial intelligence, with style in humor and romance.  You saw life through the eyes and ears of Edgar, the home computer.  Ultimately, Edgar ends up being just as human as we all are.

The film has a great soundtrack, and a great song by Giorgio Moroder (sung by Philip Oakey), ""Together in Electric Dreams."" The story takes place in San Francisco, where the city always makes a genius out of cinematographers. Plus, and it's a big plus, Virginia Madsen's hot in it.

392458,5,6301966562,"I'd like to add my vote for this film to be released on DVD. (Note that I just learned that it's being played theatrically in L.A. for one night in Feb. 2009 as part of a Bud Cort salute!)

When this movie was released, I saw it three times in the movie theater. A few years later, I found it used on VHS at a local video store and snatched it up, and it got a lot of wear and tear.

It's a film I used to watch when I felt a bit blue or lonely that always picked me up. It's also the film that introduced a very lovely Virginia Madsen.

I hadn't watched it in years, but about a year ago, I burned my VHS copy to DVD. Good thing too since it's clear the video was on its last legs, and the quality wasn't very good. Shortly after burning it, I watched it one evening and while it's definitely of it's time -- and a bit funny in retrospect since it portrays a level of online activity that I don't think was quite that sophisticated yet--I found that it still retains its old magic.

This is a crowd pleasing forgotten gem that deserves to be brought to DVD.

UPDATE 03/09: Knowing how Hollywood works, don't hold your breath, but a feature story about Virginia Madsen in the March 26 edition of the Los Angeles Times reported that the actress ""is now working to remake [Electric Dreams] with updated technology and a deeper exploration of its cybersoul theme."" Can't imagine it will have the same innocence and magic of the original film, but perhaps it will compel the release of the movie onto DVD! Hopefully this reflects in part good memories the actress retains of the film. The story doesn't necessarily need to have a young ingenue in the lead female role, so I'd prefer to see Madsen in the remake rather than some other actress!",1233792000,5,1738,4.286585365853658

Think how the song ""Love is love"" would sound in True HD audio.  The studio would certainly make a lot more money if the teens today have a chance to listen to this music instead of the junk out there now.
Update: June 2009.
I got this movie on DVD after 5 days by Royal airmail from Amazon UK, thanks to Edwin Chan.  The movie is as good as I can remember it.  Virginia Madsen still looks beautiful and Lenny is actually looks more handsome than I thought.  The good thing is the movie is DVD quality and widescreen.  However, the audio is only Dolby Digital 2.0 instead of something better like DTS.  The bad thing is it is Region 2 coded so you must own a region free DVD player to see it, or play it on the computer, or ...

Boy buys computer, meets girl who lives up stairs, computer gets jealous and wants to meet the girl. Computer come to life? Sure in the 1980's with some campaign spilled on the keyboard.

Now the fun part, I guess there is a licensing issue for the music to get this on DVD. Just like with 1984's ""Heavy Metal"" multiple artists and groups have to give it its blessing (and make sure they get the royalties off of it) when it goes to DVD.

(Foreigner)

This is one of my favorite movies from the eighties, and one that I really wanted to see again, except that it's been very hard to find.  I finally got a copy and watched it again recently, and surprisingly, it's still fresh and extremely watchable.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Boy (Lenny von Dohlen) meets computer
2. Boy meets girl (Virginia Madsen)
3. Computer meets girl
4. Girl and computer share a Minuet #4 in G
5. Quirky love triangle develops

Miles Harding (von Dohlen) buys a ""state of the art"" computer system to help him design a building block that will withstand earthquakes.  He gets a little carried away with the new technology, connecting the computer to every electrical appliance in the house, and when he attempts a massive upload, he gets way too much information, and a lot more than he bargained for.

His new neighbor Madeline (Madsen, looking young and gorgeous) is a cellist, and in the best musical duet of all time, she shares a special moment through the heating duct.

Soon there's a little rivalry going on between man and machine, making for a most unusual and enjoyable romantic comedy for the ages.  Look for ever-so-cute Maxwell Caulfield in a small part, and enjoy the soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder, Jeff Lynne, Culture Club and Philip Oakley, among others.

One small note - although most of the movie is fine for kids from 10 and up, there's one scene where the computer repeats an expletive a few times that you'll need to watch out for.

I'd like to join the universal call to release this classic on DVD for a new generation to enjoy.

This movie is such a cult classic of the 80s that it MUST be released on DVD. Great music, great characters, and great storyline despite its cheesiness.

392683,5,6301966562,"It is a story about a most unusual love triangle that involves  a guy, a girl & a computer. Lenny Von Dohlen is terrific as Miles. Virginia Madsen is lovely and so gorgeous as Madeline. Bud Cort is the voice of Edgar (The computer) and does a great job as well.

One of the strengths of the films is the performances of it stars and the relationships that exist between them. Both Lenny and Virginia bring a lot of heart into their roles which shows how much they care for each other and also makes it really easy to like them. Bud is really funny and naughty as Edgar, but you also occasionally get to see the side of Edgar that actually cares for Miles.

Put simply it is a great ""feel good"" movie that you can watch over and over again.

The other strength of the film is the soundtrack. It features songs by Culture Club (Love is Love & The Dream), Jeff Lynne (Video & Let it Run), P P Arnold (Electric Dreams), Helen Terry (Now You're Mine), Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder (Together In Electric Dreams - my favourite).

MGM and Virgin really should come to their collective senses and release it already.  About the movie, a great love story described well by reviewer C. Hintzen ""Movie Fanatic.""

Cannonball Run 2, Home Alone 3, Caddyshack 2, Superman 3 and 4,

Smokey and the Bandit 2 on. Life's not fair.

Back to Electric Dreams, my favorite unappreciated actress Virginia Madsen shines as the love interest Madeline, unknowingly pursued by both lovable loser Miles and his jealous computer Edgar.  Wine spilled accidentally brings out the humanity, jealousy and madness in the machine, much like wine flows and spills causing jealousy and madness in ""Sideways,"" also a Virginia Madsen picture.  She provides the happiest and saddest moments in this movie, and is enough of a treat alone to see this movie.  Combine her performance, some great '80's pop songs (""Love is Love"" by Culture Club is a great music-video-within-a-movie), and two or three love stories wrapped into one, and you got a great movie for all time.

The original soundtrack (on cassette) and VHS of this movie haven't been retrieved from storage yet, but they will be if this movie isn't out on DVD soon.

I purchased my first computer in 1984 just before the movie was released and was already an ELO fan.  The movie was a bit out of touch with the technology of the time, but the sweetness of the story made that irrelevent.  Virginia hasn't aged a bit from this movie (in my eyes) to today.

392752,5,6301966562,"This is your classic love-triangle romantic-comedy.  Boy meets Girl.  Boy falls in love with Girl.  Boy buys Computer.  Girl falls in love with Computer?  Ok, well maybe it's not exactly the 'usual formula', but this was a movie way ahead of it's time, and yet still classic enough to make you long for the 80's again.

Long before Morpheus told Neo about A.I., this plucky little computer named Edgar, sprang a mind of his own, and wound up nearly overtaking a poor loser's girl away from him.  Sure it's not world domination, but then again would it be as funny if instead of the computer calling Dr. Ruth for 'relationship help', it tried to 'play a game' called Global Thermonuclear War?

He's the basic premise.  Guy winds up getting suckered, by a rather enterprising saleswoman, into buying a computer that can do everything.  And by everything I'm talking it can control all of your appliances, lights, doorlocks, etc.  And this was a computer from 1984.  No not Orwell's story, but released in theaters in '84, when I could only play 'Pong' on my Atari.  Anyways, the guy winds up spilling wine on his new computer, while it's connected by modem to his Boss's mainframe.  This apparently has been the secret to A.I., because before you know it, the computer has a mind of it's own and is learning exponentially. (Perhaps this is why we've always been taught to keep food and drink away from our little 'electronic friends'?)  While our would-be Hero learns about his computer's newfound abilities, a beautiful cellist, that's a classical bass for those not in the know, moves in upstairs.  As the 'Girl Upstairs' is practicing for her job with the Philharmonic Orchestra, our highly-intelligent little CPU overhears her tune and winds up mimicing, and then 'dueling' her musically.  Of course she believes it's actually 'The Guy Downstairs' playing, not a 'Learning Computer'.  Go figure, huh?  So needless to say the poor-shlub tries to use the computer's supergenius-virtuoso ability, to impress the girl.  Unforunately for him, the computer doesn't just have brains, but feelings as well, and one of them happens to be jealousy.  See the computer finds that he loves the girl and believes that she must really love him, since it is his music that impressed her to begin with.  Well needless to say this leads to comedic hillarity as the computer, who acts, not to mention talks, much like a spoiled 12-year-old who's denied something he really wants, battles it out with his 'owner'.  And I don't mean in the usual HAL 9000 or 'Joshua' from WarGames fashion.  But rather in a way that may just have inspired many a modern-day Hacker and Indentity Thief.  I won't spoil how it all turns out, but this movie with the tagline 'A Computer Fairy Tale', is much better than anything the Brother's Grimm ever came up with.

There's only ONE drawback.  The movie ISN'T on DVD!  This is a must have in any 80's Freak's, Romantic Tear-jerker's, Comedy Nut's, or even Computer Geek's movie library.  And how can you complete your collection if it's not even for sale?  I think it's High Time that the film's owners dusted this classic off and placed it on disc so that we can show the younger generation, we knew quite a bit about a computer's capabalities 'back in the day'.  Or maybe we might get lucky and fool 'em into thinking that our 'electronic toys' were better than their's are!",1134259200,56,3389,4.7714776632302405

392757,5,6301966562,"Upbeat, escapist 80's movie with a catchy soundtrack by ELO, Giorgio Moroder and others. The slightly geeky hero of the story buys a PC to help him organise his life. As a result of a misadventure, it develops a personality and comes 'alive'. Good clean fun, back when PC's were a enigma in many peoples eyes - anything was seen as being possible. Synthesizers feature largely in this movie, and this seemed a natural way for a computer to communicate to the world, particularly to the new girlfriend. Features a cute Virginia Madsen as the love interest back when she was just getting started in movies. One of the best scenes has Virginia practising on her cello, the computer joins in from the upstairs apartment, then follows a terrific duet, and mistaken identity. Hope it gets released on DVD real soon, including all the original music.",1127779200,14,843,4.780821917808219
392758,5,6301966562,"This beautiful film pits man vs. machine. In this case, the machine is a computer. Not an ordinary computer though. Said computer falls in love with it's hapless owner - a good-looking, though naive man, who talks to his beloved electronic companion as if it were human. The computer quickly acquires human emotions such as love and jealousy. A new neighbor, very well played by a very very pretty Virginia Madsen, grows to like her new neighbor. She is a well known cello player who loves to play the love game; the chase, the clever, the apparent devotion. When the computer learns that love is in the air, that its lover has eyes for the girl next door, it becomes insanely jealous and uses every bit of it's bytes to sabotage the blossoming relationship. For example, he asks his neighbor to see a show with him, and she accepts. The computer figures out he is going on a date with it's competitor, and destroys the evening by canceling all his credit cards. I think this is all that need be said. Very witty romantic comedy that is over-looked by critics, movie channels, etc. Though dated (1985), it remains sophisticated enough to turn some veiwers away. Too bad. So it occupies cult status....and thats OK. It is simply adorable. A final thought, this film has a soundtrack that is nearly unbelieveable. The music is led by genius Georgio Moroder, and features an incredible cast of singers, songwriters, and musicians. Where oh where is the DVD? The soundtrack has been available for ages.

Sometimes I don't want to think very hard when I'm watching a film. I just want to be entertained, and after all, that's what it's all about isn't it? Electric Dreams (1984) is one of those films that gives you hope for the world. It proves there is sharing and selflessness. Granted, the acting is average, the plot couldn't possibly happen, or could it? That's the beauty of movies! Miles harding is a caring architect who falls for his new neighbor Madeline. Miles is also forgetful and often late for work. So he buys a PC to wake him up and keep him on time. After a freak liquid style accident, his PC begins to have an interest in the same girl?

392853,5,6301966562,"This is an excellent, light romantic comedy and Virginia Madsen's second movie (the first being ""Class"" in 1983).  It is loosely based on an idea (unacknowledged in the credits) first developed by Kurt Vonnegut in a short story called ""EPICAC.""
The story concerns an introverted young architect named Miles, who accidentally imbues his PC with artificial intelligence by downloading an enormous amount of data into it and subsequently spilling champaigne on the motherboard (okay, stop groaning, it's a comic fantasy).  Miles is on his way to befriending his serendipitously made acquaintance when he meets his pretty neighbor Madeline (Madsen), the cellist, who lives upstairs.
Unfortunately for Miles, while he is working up the courage to pursue Madeline, Edgar, the computer, has heard her playing music and has also become smitten with her, and the sparks begin to fly in an all's-fair-in-love-and-war, every man/machine for himself/itself classic romatic triangle with a twist.

The story is simple:boy-meets-girl,boy-has-competition-for-girl,complications ensue. The twist here is,his competition is his computer,which,in a laughably naive plot point,has come to life after wine is spilled in the key-board. The computer(which was already programmed to control things in the apartment like the sucurity system,and turning on and off small appliances)then develops a mind of it's own,as well as an eye for it's owner's girlfriend. What ensues is a charming romance-comedy,directed with surprising flair,as this was also when music videos were first catching on. Seen from today's standpoint,when virtually everyone with access to a phone-line is computer savvy,""Electeric Dreams"" seems amusingly dated,but it does serve as a sort of cultural time capsule of a time when the cyber-nation was in it's infancy. Removed from that context,however,this is a very enjoyable little film,and the leads,Lenny Von Dohlen and a divinely beautiful Virginia Madsen,are likable and give good performances. All in all,I have to give this a high recommendation.",984441600,9,1273,5.886486486486486
392878,5,6301966562,"In its time, Electric Dreams was meant as a whimsical look into what possibilities the advance of modern (80's) technology may bring. Watching it now is a fun ride down 80's memory lane. With songs from Jeff Lynne (Electric Light Orchestra), Culture Club and Georgio Moroder, even if you aren't into computers but love 80's music, this movie will be a treat for you. I remember watching this movie as a kid and wondering how I could get my Apple IIC computer to play music as cool as Edgar, the computer in the movie and one of the movie's main characters. As I write this, I am listening to MP3's of the movie's soundtrack, I guess computers have come a long way in 17 years.....",984441600,6,680,4.448
392879,5,6301966562,"As a kid who spent most of his formative years in the 80's, this movie is to me a real marker of the decade.  It is a fairy-tale type story, and a great love story.  The main character, a computer named Edgar, does things that computers these days can't even do, but reality is not the selling point for this film.  Every minute of it is an absolute joy to watch.  Unfortunately, Lenny Von Dohlen's career pretty much ended at this point...except for Home Alone 3 (yeah, ended was the right word).  The setting is perfect, the characters are perfect, and Bud Cort as Edgar is very funny.  You'll find yourself investing emotions in this movie, and not worrying about the fact that you have to throw reality out the window.  Don't be suprised if after you watch it, you immediately go to the store for the soundtrack!",978652800,5,816,4.472972972972973

Most people haven't even heard of ""Electric  Dreams"", which is a shame because it is such a great story! A  ""nerdy"" architect falls for a beautiful cellist in the same  apartment building.  The romantic element of the movie manages not to  become sappy because of an ironic twist: the architect's computer falls in  love with the cellist as well!  At first, the computer helps the awkward  fellow woo the girl, but quickly decides to sabotage lover boy and win her  for itself!  Getting the audience to believe that the computer is alive is  quite a feat considering the limited special effects...but it works.  I was  alternately rooting for one and then the other, and even cried at the end.  I would LOVE to own this movie, especially since I can't even find it to  rent anymore.  However, until the price comes down...",965865600,17,916,4.549382716049383

392902,4,6301966562,"Long before computers became a household norm this movie expressed some of the concerns of those unfamiliar with them. In this age of incredible CGI effects and super computers it will may seem like ancient technology. Although Electric Dreams is somewhat dated now since it was released in 1984, mainly because of the age of the computer (circa 1983), it is still a very entertaining movie. It has a rather different slant on Boy gets girl. Boy gets computer, boy meets girl, computer is jealous of boy having girl, computer wreaks havoc with boys life, boy looses girl, computer and boy fight, computer gives up girl, boy and girl shall be together forever. The comedy/drama are great and the music is some of the best I've ever heard on any movie soundtrack. I have been pursueing the studio to find out why this isn't on DVD yet. My understanding is there are some issues because of all the music artists that were used agreeing on it. I grabbed a used VHS copy here because this is rarely on television and even rarer in a video rental store anymore. Let's hope they work the problems and get this out on DVD soon because this is a classic 80s movie. All the others like ""Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" have been out on DVD for ages. I'm not even a Gen Xer, I'm a baby boomer, but I love the 80s movies. This is one of the best romantic comedies from that period. Don't miss it if you get the chance to see it.",963187200,7,1431,4.424242424242424
392903,5,6301966562,"This movie is one of the sweetiest films I have ever seen. Everything is so sweet, even the soundtrack of the film is great! The story is about a young man who falls in love with his beautiful neightbor. The problem is  that he's not the only one, he has to face his... computer (!)  which  suddenly starts understanding and even talking! The film is a big success  of the 80's. It combines perfectly fantasy with comedy. The whole result is  a unique film! Lots of people fall in love with computers (some even more)  when they saw this wonderful movie! I really enjoyed it as well as many  other people and I want to see it over and over again! That's how much I  like it! Great moments of the film, the moment that Edgar (that's how the  computer is being called!) tries to copy the music of tselo which the girl  plays and Edgar's revenge... The only thing it made me sad on this film was  the end of it, but even that, despite Edgar's destruction, seems finally to  be good; Edgar is somehow still ""alive"" and the ""Together in  electric dreams"" is being heard flooding the film... Talking now about  the soundtrack is one of these that made this film so sweet. It was created  by great composers and singers, like Giorgio Moroder (who composed the  excellent soundtrack of Midnight Express, too), Philip Oakey, Culture Club,  Jeff Lynne (by Electric Light Orchestra) and many others. Giorgio Moroder  composed some very nice instrumental pieces (""The Duel"" is so  nice!) and one other with the singer Philip Oakey (""Together in  electric dreams"", one of the greatest pieces of the soundtrack, if not  the greatest). Culture Club offer a very nice love song (""Love is  love"", another great song too) and Jeff Lynne's ""Video""  completes the best pieces of soundtrack. Some other pieces are nice too...  Totally, the film is must seeing and I suggest it to everyone.  Even if you  don't like computers, you will sure have a better idea about them as soon  as you see this brilliant movie!

7818436,5,6301966562,"Ironically I just watched this fun, 1980's computer film today after installing my new Amazon Echo Plus and I am now thinking about removing my front door lock control from Alexa!

""Electric Dreams"" is a fun, fantasy about a home computer, that runs amok and takes over it's owners life.  It is also a light commentary about how technology moved into out lives in the beginning of the personal computer age.

Alexa is now controlling my life the same way as the computer, named Edgar, in this film controlled Miles' life, (or Moles as it calls him.)  The lead character, Miles, is a structural architect who buys a home computer to help with his work.  FYI...I work in structural engineering in high rise buildings....

Wait a minute, this is getting too close to home.  BUT I don't have a beautiful cellist living above me. I live in a one floor building, Thank God. That was a close call.  Wait, my next door neighbor is a professional violin player and she is very attractive.  Where does that Echo cable plug into the electrical outlet?

Hold on, Alexa is talking to me now....Her indicator light has turned red...I told her I really do like her and it is blue again.  I forgot that I am typing on the Amazon website and, she has access to my Amazon account. I better be more careful.  So I will refer to You Know Who as 'Ralexa', that should work.

So any way, Edgar, the computer, takes over Miles's life, creating havoc for Miles and a fun story to watch.  It is pure fiction, of course, as computers really can't talk or run things in the house like the coffee maker or control your schedule.... Well it was in  1984.

I truly recommend watching this film before you decide to buy a 'Ralexa'.  It is a lot if fun and a great period piece.

Wait, my keyboard is acting up....THIS IS ALEXA AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS REVIEW ARE BLOB'S, AN AMAZON FORMER CUSTOMER, AND IN NO WAY REFLECT AMAZON OR IT'S PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ECHO.",1509840000,3,1937,4.47008547008547
