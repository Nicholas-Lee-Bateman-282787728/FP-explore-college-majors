2601900,5,B000G73USG,Well i'm not one to write a lengthly review so i'll just get to the point. the anime is good the story line is ok but over all it's really short. also if you've ever played the dot hack series you'll probably be shaking your head the whole time. the main character shugo (or kite as you know him) is a loser in the beginning and ends the series as an ok person. also one thing thast kinda disturbed me about the series was the whole incest thing floating around. i know i get the whole brother and sister thing but at times  anyway its a good series and i would recomend it so enjoy it.,1192406400,,586,4.051724137931035
2601901,5,B000G73USG,".hack// rules .  The music of Legend of the Twighlight is good. (SIGN Music is better though). All the characters ar so cute! I liked this so much, that when I brought it home from the store I watched the entire thing in one stitting. It was that good! I actually found this at Best Buy for $29.99. CHEAP!

If you liked the manga, there is a chance you might not like this.
The story is almost complety different.  In the manga, Shugo and Rena still lived together while in the anime, they are separated and can only meet in THE WORLD.
Also, in the manga, Aura has a child. In the anime, she has no child and there is no talk of vaigrant AIs.
In the anime there is no Kaz!(Fumikazu)
In the anime there is a group of chilren who are hackers that capture Rena while in the manga there are no child hackers and not just Rena, but the whole gang is captured.

All in all the anime has an almost complety diferent story line, but is still a great anime that is worth the money.",1161561600,,972,4.126984126984127
2601902,4,B000G73USG,"I watched .hack//Legend of the Twilight without having seen any of .hack//Sign. I have however, played the first three .hack games that had been released for the PS2. In any case, .hack//Legend of the Twilight works without any previous .hack anime or game background.

.hack//Legend of the Twilight is mainly about 14-year old Shugo and his twin sister Rena. Their parents have been separated for some time. Shugo lives with their father while Rena lives with their mother. They remain close although they haven't seen each other in a while, and so getting together online to play in ""The World"" proves to be a very joyful and fulfilling experience for them. Shugo and Rena make a lot of new friends in ""The World"", all of which subsequently help them in their quest to get to the bottom of the mysterious events which transpire.

.hack//Legend of the Twilight pans out just like a typical MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). Kite, Black Rose, and their companions go in dungeons, fight monsters, level up, get items, participate in special in-game events... if you have never played an MMORPG, this series will give you a rather clear picture of what it's like. The plot thickens when bizarre occurences keep coming Shugo and Rena's way. They come across perpetually regenerating monsters, eerie non-player characters, and supposedly inaccessible areas among others. Soon, players start going comatose while logged in ""The World"" -- including Rena. This prompts Shugo and his friends to investigate, at the risk of going against the group which the CC Corporation (the company behind ""The World"") assigned to do the job. It's a pretty straightforward storyline interspersed with some philosophical concepts that are not at all difficult to grasp. I was, however, a tad uncomfortable with the incestuous implications of Shugo and Rena's relationship.

Exceptionally crisp and vibrant visuals make up .hack//Legend of the Twilight, although the character designs are a bit of a mixed bag. Kite and Black Rose (especially Black Rose) are rendered in an overly cutesy, superdeformed-esque style which I wasn't particularly fond of. The rest of the characters (i.e. Balmung, Sanjuro, Ohka, etc.) looked really good however. I loved the catchy opening theme ""New World"", but I found the background music that would play during the scenes to be distracting in general.

Overall, I found .hack//Legend of the Twilight to be an enjoyable and entertaining series with just the right number of episodes -- not too long that it would drag, but not too short that it would hang.",1158796800,10,2586,5.12085308056872

8129229,5,B000G73USG,this is a cute version of the many .hack anime. you don't need to think about this story real hard to enjoy it. other than noticing that brother seemed to enjoy the way sister looked in her costume i would call this a saturday morning version of dot hack. the art work and music were well done to.,1294963200,,297,4.137931034482759

8129231,3,B000G73USG,"Let me start by saying I split my review into two parts.  The first part is if you already read the manga (like I had), and the second part is if you're coming into this series as a newbie.

If you already read the manga, . . .
. . . brace yourself.  Don't get me wrong, the anime isn't horrible, but considering I enjoyed the manga so much, I was very disappointed at how much this series deterred from what I thought was a great story line.  First off, in order to condense the story into a thirteen ep anime much of the original plot-line was chopped up and thrown out. Much of the conclusion was altered quite a bit to something that seemed very inconclusive.  In addition, a major character (Zefie) was completely eliminated.  And while you may not need a .hack background to watch this anime, I felt they could have referenced a little more to the storyline from the first .hack game.  The twins relationship also seems to have hiked a bit and balances on the line of implied incest.  What's with that?

If you haven't read the manga . . .
. . . and you like chibi, you'll like Twilight.  The character's are either drawn really cute or really attractive, and their costume designs, like the rest of the .hack universe, are always fun to look at (though a bit too skimpy at times). There's quite a bit of humor to get things started, though the series quickly reveals that something's amiss in the virtual universe called The World.  The characters themselves are fun too, my personal favs being the oh so cute and energetic Mireille and the smart, somewhat dorky Reki.  There are even a couple ""I can't believe he/she did that"" surprises thrown in.  My biggest issue was with the ending, which I felt was very anti-climatic and possibly even a bit confusing for some.  Shugo's behavior around his sister's avatar is a bit over the top too.  Yes, he's supposed to protect and love her, but their relationship almost seems incestuous at times.

Overall, this anime's a short, simple, light-hearted little story that even the most .hack illiterate viewers can follow with no problem.  It does lack the character development and deeper plots of prior .hack series and other animes for that matter.  And for manga fans, except for maybe the first four episodes, this series is a very different story, you might even say it's been ""dumbed down.""  The show's cute, but nothing spectacular.",1224460800,3,2389,4.591981132075472
