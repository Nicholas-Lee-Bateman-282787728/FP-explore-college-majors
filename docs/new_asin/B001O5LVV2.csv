3729051,5,B001O5LVV2,Enjoyed this story a lot. So many things I never knew  that went on back in the days when I thought Americans were respectful of the dead.,1252368000,3,138,4.111111111111111
3729052,5,B001O5LVV2,"I watched this on the History Channel and was amazed at the events that happened to the body of our greatest president after his death. I can't believe that these events are not better known to all of us. Had I not seen the show, I never would have known. I bought the video, so I can get as many people to watch it as I can. Not just the details of the story, but the making of it was very well done!",1246492800,4,401,3.8433734939759034
3729053,5,B001O5LVV2,"I loved this gem of history past but what is really facinating is the technology used that made Mr. Lincoln ""come to life"". We see him walking down the White house staircase, walk down the street tipping his hat to people as they walk by and, along with his wife Mary, sitting in the box at Ford's Theatre at the moment of his assassination by a pistol shot to the back of his head at the hand of actor John Wilkes Booth. It is just like seeing actual clips of Lincoln bringing him to life (and death) again. This is a ""Must Have"" for the collection of any admirer of our sixteenth president who died just five days after saving the union of the United States after four years of a bloody Civil War. *****",1241481600,15,705,4.229629629629629
3729054,5,B001O5LVV2,"Very informative documentary. Most people have no idea what our 16th president's body went through until it's final resting place some 30 years AFTER his assasination. Did you know that the original ""Lincoln's Tomb"" had to be rebuilt due to faulty construction, or that the president's body was buried in the basement of the tomb (not in the vault above) for over a decade for fear of another attempt at stealing it! This film goes into great detail about how the body was preserved, the journey across Amercia and the plot to steal it. Digital reconstruction of the body in the casket and of Lincoln himself. A must for history buffs, Lincoln historians and those just curious. Well worth it!",1237852800,28,693,4.783333333333333
3729055,5,B001O5LVV2,"So many other reviewers have done a good job of describing in detail what this product is that I just want to give a few thoughts...

I saw Stealing Lincoln's Body on the History Channel several years ago.  This is a fascinating, historical, shocking, disturbing, and morbid documentary about what happened to Abraham Lincoln after his assassination and what happened to his body over the next several decades.  If you think you know just about everything about April 14, 1865 and the weeks that followed, then there's also a good chance you might not know everything.  This documentary is an eye opener about what happened to Lincoln's body YEARS and even DECADES after his death.  I won't spoil it for you, so you'll have to watch for yourself.

Highly recommended.",1428969600,,767,4.861538461538461
3729056,5,B001O5LVV2,"One of the most fascinating, high-quality documentaries of the history of Lincoln's body as it moved toward its final resting place. The plot to steal it is better than any fiction. Little-known history brought to life brilliantly.",1420070400,,231,5.27027027027027

3729058,5,B001O5LVV2,"I enjoyed watching this documentary.  I was shocked to know that anyone would have tried to steal President Lincoln's body.  The thought is just outrageous--but then I guess there isn't anything someone won't do for money, power or praise.  I was surprised to learn that Mr. Lincoln and his family weren't permanently buried till almost the turn of the century or 1900.",1407888000,,369,4.919354838709677
3729059,5,B001O5LVV2,"This was a very good documentary.  It has photographs, explanations and re-enactments to tell the history.",1407110400,,106,5.625
3729060,5,B001O5LVV2,"Excellent biography and photography.  Very interesting how the plan was hatched and failed at the cemetary.  Very interesting to know what the last hours of Abraham Lincoln's were like.  To know that they removed his brain to weigh it and that the bullit fell out and they had to find it.  The first president to be embalmed - first state funeral - where to be buried - how one photographer takes a picture - that it was preserved by Edwin Stanton - the man who ordered it destroyed.  Very interesting that the grave was not guarded, only pad locked.  Failed plan to hide him in the basement because of water - covered him with boards for a few years.  Reburied in basement and told he was safe.  From 1865 - 1901 moved 10 times.  And the final viewing of Lincoln's tomb with Edwin Stanton's words ""Now he belongs to the ages"" overhead.  A wonderful tribute to this beloved president.",1401235200,,884,4.50314465408805
3729061,5,B001O5LVV2,"This is probably a bit of history unknown to most Americans and well explained here.  There was a movie made in the early 30's dealing with the subject and I remember reading of the last surviving observer in the 1960's who at the time this took place, was a boy.",1398297600,,263,4.26
3729062,4,B001O5LVV2,"We have visited the Lincoln Exhibit in Springfield Illinois several times during our travels.
Our favorite B&B, Flagg Farmsted had the book in our bedroom.  It was delightful and
informative reading depicting the era of the 1860-1870 in Illinois. We never realized that
the counterfeiting was such a widespread phenomenon, and this case the primary goal
of the crazy plot to steal Lincol'""s body.  The DVD depicts an excellent story describing this
bizarre event.  gh",1397088000,,467,5.2
3729063,5,B001O5LVV2,Outstanding look into history from a very different prospective! Informational and educational as well as entertaining!  Felt like I was there actually participating in one of the most terrible moments in our Country's history!,1394236800,,227,5.676470588235294
3729064,5,B001O5LVV2,Arrived in excellent condition.  Interesting information on Lincoln that I never knew was out there.  For historians I would advise to purchase this movie.,1387756800,,155,5.416666666666667
3729065,5,B001O5LVV2,Granddaughter needed this to supplement a report on Lincoln for a class project. I was surprised when she and several fellow students sat and watched the entire documentary.,1381017600,,173,5.214285714285714
3729066,5,B001O5LVV2,"I was memorized by the subject matter.  As a native Illinoisan I thought I knew everything about Lincoln.  The decades it took to finally properly entomb a late President of the United States was appalling.

This is a treasure trove to any student of American history.",1374969600,,268,4.782608695652174
3729067,5,B001O5LVV2,"This is a fascinating account of how hate and bigotry can so move on people minds that they are willing to do heinous crimes. As horrid as it was that President Lincoln was assassinated by a ruthless group who formed a conspiracy to get rid of the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State all in simultaneous assassinations. Their plan did not go exactly as expected. But even in their failure, they did kill Lincoln. Yet when the time to place Lincolm in a final resting place came, again ruthless and unlawful people sought to steal his body. Several times the body had to be moved to protect and provide some decorum of respect to this assassinated president. A very in depth look as the evil that can overtake some men's minds. Well worth the price and well worth watching several times as you will pick up on new details each time you watch it.",1371081600,,866,4.522292993630574
3729068,5,B001O5LVV2,One of the most interesting Lincoln videos I have ever watched. Filled with facts I never knew. I loved it.,1369785600,,107,4.4
3729069,5,B001O5LVV2,A Very interesting and Complicated Tale. Amazing how many times Lincoln's body has been moved. Also some history of death - the civil war and embalming. Crazy story about criminals conspiring to steal the body - the formation of the Secret Service. At times His body was more protected in death - than in life. I gave 4.5 Stars - because they put this odd 'film/rewind' effect - just jump cut from one thing to another - I found that a mildly annoying. Otherwise - fascinating.

3729070,5,B001O5LVV2,"As if the Lincoln assassination itself wasn't bizarre enough, this one is just as crazy.

Quite rightly, the first part of this program goes through the assassination and aftermath (yet not in as much detail as other documentaries).  Don't let this put you off, but it is approximately 35 minutes in before you start getting introduced to the people who were planning to steal Lincoln's body.  To understand the audacity of the body-stealing plot, you need to understand (or be reminded) how important Lincoln was, and that is what the History Channel have tried to convey in the first part of this program.

The second part of the program goes through the plot in some detail and finishes off with the inability to leave Lincoln's body in one place.  There are a magnitude of reasons for this, and they are covered in this History Channel production.

Stealing Lincoln's Body is crazy, insane and macabre...you'll love it.  Add this to your DVD collection today!",1364428800,,963,4.871165644171779
3729071,5,B001O5LVV2,"This documentary blew my mind! Was this the latest Hollywood script? No- it is authentic documented  HISTORY!  Funny, when I was in High School, I always felt that oldie moldie History was oh so BORING! What an IDIOT? Then again, maybe the teachers were the ones who were boring. I never even was aware that a woman was hung because of her alleged involvement in the murder of President Lincoln. This just proves that crooks will always find a way to make money. The way this plot was thwarted so long ago without the use of modern technology is positively fascinating! History Buffs will love this one. It is well presented and so compelling! I highly recommend it!",1360454400,,666,4.635593220338983

3729075,5,B001O5LVV2,"Very informative and interesting to watch.  Packed full of history with allot of little ""tid-bits"" of info thrown in, making it a great documentary for the Lincoln fan, or just someone interested in the era. Plenty of real photographs, along with reinactments of scenes that are very realistic. A very good dvd, worth the money and then some.",1354924800,,342,4.896551724137931

3729077,5,B001O5LVV2,need I say more?  No other president in history will be as respected and adored as was Lincoln!  I highly recommend this program.,1353801600,2,129,4.565217391304348

3729079,5,B001O5LVV2,"As a lifelong fan of Abraham Lincoln, I had to get the book as soon as it came out. The narrative is richly detailed and informative and fascinating - there's so much, in fact, that the documentary couldn't encompass it all.

Something not much remarked on by other reviewers here (at least that I could find) is how funny many parts of this documentary are. I think Lincoln himself would have laughed out loud at the humor.  The humor is aptly placed - it centers largely on the mind-bogglingly inept criminals at the heart of this story.  Example: one of the criminals specialized in counterfeiting...nickles?  Think Keystone Cops, and you'll have an idea.

Of course, book and documentary alike are tender and touching when it comes to Lincoln and the people who loved him. The narrative is respectful of the history, and as noted by others here, the technology used to bring the story to life is interesting (but never overwhelms its purpose).

This is one of our favorite documentaries on television, and every time it comes on, whatever the hour, we stop to watch it again...we're watching it right now, in fact, while I write this review.

For anyone who thinks history is boring, this is the documentary that could change their mind.  We viewers are lucky that such care, attention, and intelligence was devoted to putting this film together.

Book and documentary alike are HIGHLY recommended! They complement each other perfectly - and the author is not only an excellent writer, he also one of the many delightful, deft and knowledgeable historians who appear in the documentary!",1321142400,5,1590,4.881040892193308
3729080,5,B001O5LVV2,"An amazing documentary on a little known part of Lincoln's history. It's hard to believe that such a thing could happen. Like many of the hardships suffered during Lincoln's life, his final resting place was 35+ years in the making. Very unfitting for one of the greatest Presidents of all time.

A++++++ !",1303689600,,306,4.773584905660377
3729081,5,B001O5LVV2,"I saw this program once on television and realized that I had to have it. When I went to purchase it, however, I found that it was horribly expensive and only came in packs.

3729082,5,B001O5LVV2,"What has been said about this documentary does not need to be repeated. It is a four star film about Lincoln and the plot to steal his remains.

I want to reassure the hearing impaired that this is closed captioned. Although there is not a section in the main menu for closed captions, rest assured that as long as your TV has the ability to view films with closed captions, it will work for you.

Snap up a copy of this award winning documentary as fast as you can. You will not be disappointed.",1277596800,5,496,4.26595744680851
3729083,5,B001O5LVV2,"This documentary about a foiled attempt to steal Lincoln's body is a little-known blurp in our history.  The 1870s were a turbulent time in this country, as Reconstruction wrapped up yet hatred remained between North and South.

Any fan of Lincoln would love this documentary because of the topic.  This documentary isn't so much about Lincoln's life retold yet again, but rather about his death and (afterlife) shown from a new perspective.  Who would think to imagine what it must have been like to transport his decaying body via railroad through the Midwest, as it slowly starts smelling the boxcar?  Or the process of embalming his body, a new science at the time?  This documentary is the last possible documentary one could have made without being redundant.

I plopped this DVD in ""just to check it out"" and was glued to the screen from the start.  The graphics in this documentary, especially seeing Lincoln so life-like was like watching him get killed up-close all over again.  The assassination scene is quite gruesome as his body slumps to the lower left and toward Mary.  This is an eerie yet fascinating simulation of what Lincoln was like in his final days on earth, and the near absurd plot to steal his body.  I am still amazed anyone would think of robbing a grave for someone's bones.",1261180800,5,1304,4.776785714285714
3729084,5,B001O5LVV2,"This is the most unique Lincoln program I have ever seen. Using modern ""Motion Capture"" animation technology, (think Tom Hanks in Polar Express) Lincoln literally comes to life like never before. (excepting the various Lincoln shows at Disneyland and Walt Disney World) They used real images of Lincoln in a computer and had an actor in a ""motion capture suit."" The result is the most interesting, unique and maybe even startling video I have even seen.",1255564800,18,453,4.973684210526316
