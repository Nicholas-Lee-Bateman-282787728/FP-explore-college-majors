4400584,4,B004L690XW,"A MUST-SEE - I don't know why this movie wasn't a ""hit"" or even circulated in the USA? Were the censors at work - even keeping it out of the USA?  An excellent Movie.  The peasant's life in Europe in the 800s is well-portrayed. And so is the early history of the Catholic Church in Charlemagne's empire.  A Well-done & a must-see if one is interested in Women's Lib and the role of women in the Church and if one likes historical epics.",1362096000,,436,4.228915662650603

4400587,4,B004L690XW,I only wish it came to being.  The performances were excellent.  I had a double take at who portrayed the pope  color was superb.  It was a trifle bloody during the slaughter of the Hugenots.  Oh well isn't that how the church put down dissent.,1352764800,,244,4.333333333333333
4400588,2,B004L690XW,"I've always been fascinated by the story of Pope Joan, so when I heard about this Blu-ray movie I was excited to buy it. I'm also a firm believer that women often get erased from history, so I thought it was important to watch it for that reason too.  I am sorry to say I was just appointed.

First, it takes too long for her to become Pope and she is only a pope in the last 15 minutes of the movie.  I understand they wanted to concentrate on her childhood and her adolescence and everything else that came before she became the head of the church, but sometimes all of that took too long and it became redundant; it made the story move slowly.

From a technical standpoint there is no navigation menu, so as soon as you put the Blu-ray in the player it starts playing the move right away.  I could not get rid of the subtitles.  As much as I tried to go to a main menu, it would not let me.  Eventually I had to watch it with subtitles I did not understand, which were just in the way.

(SPOILER ALERT!!!)...  And finally the ending they present is not the story I know about Pope Joan.  There are two commomly known versions of how she died.  One says she gives birth in the middle of the street and then she and her child are stoned to death by the masses when they realize she was a woman.  The other says that after she gives birth she is dragged by a horse until she dies.  I was expecting one or the other and was disappointed when neither of these two versions were reflected on screen. The ending they presented was far less interesting.  :(

After criticizing all that I have criticized, I do think it's important for girls and women to watch this film because it does empower them and it questions why the Catholic Church does not accept women in high levels of power.  Nonetheless, I cannot overlook how they butchered the ending and that is why I must give it only two stars.",1332547200,2,1890,4.222841225626741
4400589,5,B004L690XW,"After having seen the film, I would have to agree with the author; I think it could have happened. As far as other women attaining high places in the church at that time,as the story teller infers;well I doubt that. But that detracts nothing from the story. A must see movie. Highly enjoyable.",1332115200,,293,4.547169811320755
4400590,4,B004L690XW,"Really great movie - empowering especially for women that a woman could go so far in a church dominated by men.

My ONLY gripe about this DVD is there's definitely a deleted scene.  When I watched it on TV there's a scene where her father comes to the monastery she's at (and I won't say anything beyond that so I don't spoil anything) but that scene is not in there and the thing is that scene I felt was important to the story.

But other than that (and if you haven't seen it on TV you'll never miss that scene anyway) it's a wonderful movie and I'd highly recommend it.",1331596800,3,573,4.1909090909090905
4400591,5,B004L690XW,"I was fascinated by the book and got a DVD which gives me the choice to listen to the dialogue in either German or English. I cannot remember where I bought it, it is an all-region DVD but when I play it on my regular DVD player there are some problems, I can play it on my laptop though. So much for the technical part.
Lately I developed a taste for history and I am impressed with the picture drawn in this film of Germany and Italy in the ninth century, a time when there wasn't really a unified Germany yet. A time which was so misogynous that the father of the heroine would not even pretend to be happy about the birth of a daughter. Only sons count and only sons got an education. {Not that this attitude would change over the next thousand years really.} Born in this world (Germany) is an extremely gifted little girl who contrary to her brother picks up writing and reading and foreign languages without problems, just because she hungers for knowledge.
The intelligent heroine, Joan, soon decides that she will only be able to learn and be recognized if she is a man and seizes the opportunity of her brother's death during an attack to pose as him and live as a monk. Well, I suppose monks do not undress before each other and there was probably no public urinal at this time, so she gets away with it despite monthly periods and a voice which does not change into anything more masculine.
When a severe illness threatens to expose her she leaves the abbey and eventually ends up in Rome, where due to her superior knowledge she becomes the personal advisor to the pope and eventually gets elected to be pope herself.  Of course the Catholic Church has always denied that there ever was a female pope and from all I have ever read about popes it seems even more impossible due to the fact that she was a foreigner.
But the journey described  to get to the Holy Chair is fascinating enough and the images of the  life of poor peasants and wealthy Romans interesting. There is a love story built in, which sounds a little bit improbable but I guess every good story needs a little bit of sex.
It is a beautiful film. Well-acted by the lead and supporting actors and it is thought-provoking film and as these are so rare, worth while watching just for that.",1314835200,7,2267,4.405727923627685
4400592,4,B004L690XW,"Joan is a young girl in a small border village with ambitions of her own. She is eager to read and learn which comes into conflict with her incredibly sexist father who is the priest of the village. To ruin the ending, she becomes pope. Big shock. There really isn't much more I can say about the plot since it is more about the journey than the destination. To detail every even would ruin the film. Basically though she goes from monastery to monastery until she ends up as pope.

The amazing thing about this film is that it's set in the Carolingian Empire. As far as I'm aware this era has never been filmed before. Occasionally there will be Viking movies but they always seem to raid England or Scandinavia, never France. The costumes and sets are stunning. Visually this film is a work of art.

Given the small gene pool of villages certain extreme features must have been even more common amongst the poor than the nobility. The hairstyles and dress don't help make them more attractive, especially with the ugly and realistic tonsures the priests have. Only minor thing is that Lothar has a goatee when he should have had a big mustache like all the Carolingians. In fact, I never see mustaches in films except westerns. I wonder why that is? The Dark Age country buildings are dark and cramped but the Rome sets are grand and impressive. There is a great deal of dirt on display and the prosthetics and makeup are believable. It never really delves into Carolingian culture but you get a feeling for how isolated and frightening it was back then. The story is fairly typical, one person out to prove herself while all of her colleagues put her down. The twists are fairly expected and there are no real surprises during the film.

This film reflects a real love of learning and education. The authors they mention are real as are the Latin snippets and the book being discussed at the end. Little touches like watching them perforate the books so that they can bind them add greatly to the film's feeling of realism. Not that it ever feels real unfortunately. It falls into that far too typical need to have characters reflect modern beliefs rather than ancient ones. But while the people and emotions may not feel real the world that they exist in does.

The two male leads are the real problem with this film. As a very strongly feminist film it's not surprising that the love interest falls into the typically female role of being supportive and nothing else. What is irritating is that both men are merely caricatures of actual characters. While her father is everything evil about men; cruel, violent, sexist, horny, hypocritical, and dismissive, her lover represents everything that's good about men: kind, compassionate, supportive, gentle, honorable, and honest. There is no flesh to these characters, no matter how hard the actors try. And David Wenham in particular does his best to make his character likable which is a far cry from his more usual roles. He's good enough that you can honestly like him even though there's nothing to him. Most of the male characters fall into one of these roles, either being evil and opposing her or being good and helping her. Sometimes the various reasons for helping can be interesting. For example, the second priest to help her does so because he's a drunken lout and enjoys a good laugh. Not deep but at least different. More often they are given no reason but that they're unpleasant.

Pope Sergius II fares rather better than the other men. His is actually a character as opposed to a caricature. Most people seeing this will be astonished to see John Goodman in the role. This is a far cry from anything he's done before but he absolutely owns the character. He makes a rather grating and unpleasant man likable. I've heard people criticise his performance in this as over the top but it's supposed to be. The guy's a drama queen. His every reaction seems extreme. Also interesting is Lothar, king of the Franks. He doesn't get a chance to be particularly sexist but his ego and arrogance come right out. Joan herself never rises above her essential goodness to become a breathing character yet that is not due to the performance but the script. The actress is good, and it helps that she's not particularly attractive since that makes her fit into a male-dominated world better.

This is a German production that was filmed in English. I noticed that most of the supporting cast have German names (including the lead) yet the dialogue always sounds like perfect English with an English accent. Strangely this is one of those cases where having national accents would make sense since they go from Germany to France to Italy all without changing accents. The production values are as good as any rival Hollywood movie. This film offers a good glimpse into a world long since vanished. Hopefully this film was successful enough to make more studios make movies on this time period. It really does feel like diving into a world that you've never seen.",1306281600,35,5387,4.876637554585153

4400594,5,B004L690XW,"Mechanics: After reading the mixed reviews, I was nervous.  But my Sony All-Region (Region-Free) DVD player was up to the challenge.  The DVD wasn't a dud, and it played fine.  It wasn't poorly dubbed as another review complained (at least, the English wasn't); I could tell it had been filmed in English, and the audio followed the visual spot-on.  *NOTE: I used an ALL-REGION / REGION-FREE DVD player.  This means that it was NOT a standard American/US DVD player.

Opinion: I loved Cross' book when I read it a number of years ago, and when I saw her story adapted to screen via the Reelz holiday feature, I was elated.  I recorded it on my Dad's DVR.  But when I went to watch it later that weekend, I discovered it had been split in half, and the other half had been played the day before, and was not set to ever be played again.  Since I knew the story, I watched the recorded portion anyway, and thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was, but I have been waiting since -- what, 2009, 2010? -- to see this in its entirety.  Some of the reviews said that some material had been excised/abridged in this 'edition'/version.  I have a vague feeling that might be right, but I'm still satisfied with having the full story (2 1/2 hours' worth) at last available to me.

The screenwriters and producers get extra points for their very good portrayal of early Medieval Europe; the acting is very well done, and the story compelling.  Highly recommended",1414886400,2,1447,4.54054054054054

8433905,1,B004L690XW,"I saw one movie about the legendary figure of Pope Joan a few years ago, that was made in the 1980s- and decided to watch the more recent remake from 2009. I refer to her as Legendary in the sense that we are not certain if she ever even existed- the first references to her are not until the 13th century- four centuries after she is meant to have lived.

Like many modern movies, the 2009 offering suffers from a surfeit of Politically Correct liberal ideology and modern sentiments, and perpetuates some of the most pernicious and persistent myths about the Middle Ages. Many of the Christian and especially the clerical characters are depicted as narrow-minded, superstitious and rabidly intolerant of anything that smacks of pagan learning- which includes the works of classical Greek and Roman authors. Yes, the myths perpetuated by the writers of the 18th and 19th century are still alive and well.

Others, more knowledgeable than I on this subject have discussed it in more detail elsewhere, but, the ridiculousness of the myths and distortions in the movie can be demonstrated by simply taking a rudimentary look at medieval writings and Literature. We have Boethius Consolation of Philosophy from the sixth century- 300 years before Joan, and a number of other works from before the 11th century peppered with references to the Classical writers. We have treatises and guides to the medicinal use of herbs written by clerics- so much for the idea that intolerant Christians thought herbalism was pagan magic.
In fact, one of the most savage ironies of the movie could be that Joans father, who represents the worst excesses of intolerance and irrationality is supposed to have been an Englishman- and so a compatriot of Alcuin of York- a prominent figure at Charlemagnes court- and today regarded as one of the greatest European scholars of his age.

In one particularly contradictory scene, the ignorant superstitious men of the Papal Court are seen bleeding the bedridden Pope- and then object to Joan mentioning the methods of Hippocrates as he was a pagan. Yet the very practice of bleeding has its origins in the ideas of such men as the second century pagan Greek physician, Galen. In another Joan uses her knowledge of the classics, to recreate a machine designed by Archimedes. One almost expected the film-makers to have her going all the way, and developing the geocentric model 800 years before Galileo.

Yet the medical ignorance and fear of supposed pagan learning are not the only myths to afflict the film. The other, and by the far the most prominent, is the pernicious idea that the church was opposed to education for women. Hence, because of discrimination and prejudice at the Cathedral School, Joan impersonates a man, to become a monk and gain access to the scholarly works there.
This detail in particular did not ring true. If a women of the ninth century wanted to be educated she could have done so by going to a nunnery, or Abbey for women. Plenty of these existed across Europe, and could offer women and education at least comparable to that of any monastery. As a further boon, their female students would not have needed to dress as men and disguise their sex.
Why the movie makes absolutely no mention of the female-run religious institutions of Early Medieval Europe, and the opportunities they afforded women is anyones guess. My guess that all mention is omitted to uphold the myth of Christian misogyny, and present Joan as some proto-feminist model of a woman struggling against a patriarchal system that opposes her efforts at every turn. At the end of the movie, there is another disguised female cleric- who wonders how many others there are like her.

Yet my response to all of the PC proselytising was to think of Hild of Whitby, the prominent seventh century Royal Lady and Abbess of Whitby. A Dark Age churchwoman who became so influential and respected, that Kings came to her for advice, and she presided over the famous Synod of Whitby. Incidentally, she also established a school, in which prominent Bishops of the period studied in their youth. Or another woman- Dhouda, the wife of the Carolingian Duke Bernard of Septemania who wrote the Liber Manualis. Or indeed the daughter of Alfred the Great, who in the late ninth century is said to have been given the same education as her brothers in her fathers court.

In other words, there were plenty of educated and influential women in church and state at the time of the probably fictional Joan, and before. I for one don't know of any inherent fear or objection to education for women in the medieval church. The arguments made against it are absurd (probably on purpose) and easily refuted. Yet in typical movie style that which is not representative of the time is made out to have been common knowledge. Another less than satisfactory movie, offering a Pedestrian view of the medieval era, and advancing the age-old conflict thesis  alongside a Dan Brown like conspiracy theory asserting that she was deliberately airbrushed from history.

In truth, if Joan ever existed, her struggle depicted in the movie was almost entirely unnecessary. It was already possible for a woman to gain High Office in the church, get a decent education- and even hold Political office as a Regent for an underage heir. Indeed, less than 70 years after her supposed death, a women in the country of her fathers birth was leading armies against the Vikings. This was Ethelfleada the daughter of Alfred the Greta- and nobody complained about what she did because she was a woman.",1466812800,,5572,4.870253164556962

I greatly enjoyed the movie but three important parts of the book were not included in the movie and while not absolutely important for the ""story"" extremely important to me and many readers, I would have loved them to be included, it didn't matter how long the movie was, it was extremely enjoyable.
