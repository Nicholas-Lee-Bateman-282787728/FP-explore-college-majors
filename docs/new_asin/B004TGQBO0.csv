4465650,3,B004TGQBO0,"I got this hoping there would be more than 1 dance on it because I didn't see it specify how many were on there. There is 1 routine. They go through the moves several times so that you can get a hang of the dance, and there is a performance mode where they no longer tell you what the order of the moves are. The dance is pretty fun, it's repetitive. Some sexy moves, some boring. The sexy stretch is a pretty good workout too. Overall the product is pretty decent, I was just hoping for more.",1355788800,4,493,4.092783505154639
8440639,1,B004TGQBO0,"I ordered this and got the wrong DVD.  I got ""Booty Beat I"" from the ""ultimate booty beat collection"" and I don't like it as much (I used to have the teaser collection)",1464652800,,168,4.090909090909091
8440640,5,B004TGQBO0,"Seemed like a good workout at the time, but I was a bit out of shape. That being said, I must inform potential buyers that this particular DVD routine resulted in engagement and almost immediate pregnancy on my first run through. Purchase at your own risk. You've been warned.",1450915200,,276,4.653061224489796

8440643,5,B004TGQBO0,I love this DVD. It works out every one of your muscles and you can feel it everywhere. It's fun to do and it makes you feel sexy as your doing it. So much fun.,1407974400,,160,3.6
8440644,4,B004TGQBO0,"This DVD is enjoyable, though not nearly as fun as the actual class.",1406678400,,68,4.3076923076923075
8440645,1,B004TGQBO0,"Hey girls!  Get off your celullitic keester and drop the pounds by dancing like a whore!  Now you, too, can emulate the cheap, skeevie strip club eroticists by wriggling your badonkadonk, chesticles and pleasure center in the convenience of your own living room.  Jiggle and twerk yourself into a slimmer you, making your curvalicious bounty irrestistable to the mailman and UPS truck driver by jostling, jiggling, bouncing and pelvic-thrusting yourself into an autoerotic frenzy.

8440646,5,B004TGQBO0,I was bored using the treadmill & the elliptical so this helped me do something new.  It also helped me with my dancing skills! My hubby likes to watch me workout to this!,1379462400,,171,4.181818181818182
8440647,3,B004TGQBO0,"This isn't the worst of the flirty girl fitness series, but isn't the best either. I prefer flirty girls toning workouts to thier dance ones. Maybe the instructors are better if you take a class in person, but they don't seem to know how to teach routines, at least not on video.

Booty Beat is one of thier better dance ones because they treat it more as dance as exercise than a serious routine. It is more fun than thier other dance dvds, easier to follow than thier others. Also this has a warm-up and cool down which many of the flirty girl dvds lack.

On the down side, a lot of the moves are really cheesy (i'm embarrassed to do them if anyone is home), and the moves do not seem to go with the music. I haven't tossed it out but since I have a few exercise dvds I don't use this one as much as others.

I'm honestly not sure if I recomend this workout. I'd say if you like cheesy dance moves and you see someone selling a used copy for under $2 go for it, but I wouldn't suggest paying full price.",1362960000,,1005,4.091370558375634
8440648,2,B004TGQBO0,"This video has tons of potential if you are looking for a workout with sexy moves (good for preparing for a strip tease routine or before going clubbing if you don't feel confident in your dance ability). However, the fact that the moves don't go with the lame music that is playing was an instant deal breaker for me. It is clear that they filmed this to different music (or perhaps with no music) and then added the audio track later.

This video contains some quality, sexy moves, but then lost my interest when the moves became overly cheesy and resembling something I would do if I was making fun of a drunk girl dancing at a club. (""Spin it! Ride it! Smack it!"") Between the annoying instructor yelling each move at me, the cheesy dancing, and the fact that the music doesn't sync with the moves, this is not a workout I will be repeating. It did get my heart rate up and I felt some toning in my inner thighs, but I stopped the DVD after 20 minutes.",1361145600,,956,4.311111111111111
