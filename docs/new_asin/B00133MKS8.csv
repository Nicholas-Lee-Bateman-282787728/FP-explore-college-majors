However, I do not recommend watching her movies that were made before Jezebel, including Of Human Bondage and Hell's House. She was still a wonderful actress in that early period, but if you want to see a good movie with good quality and plot line, go get her later works:

Now, Voyager; Deception; The Letter; Dark Victory; All This and Heaven Too; Watch on the Rhine; All About Eve; The Nanny; Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte; or the all out crazy Bette movie-Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?",1299196800,8,572,4.777777777777778

SYNOPSES--

OF HUMAN BONDAGE--  Struggling artist with a physical infirmity enrolls in medical school. He meets and falls in love with an unschooled waitress, which severely complicates his life. She abandons him for others on two different occasions, returning only when she's in trouble. Based on the Somerset Maugham story.

HELL'S HOUSE--  Made at the tail end of Prohibition, it's the story of a youngster who idolizes a bootlegger. He refuses to testify against his friend and is sent to reform school, where he meets a boy with a severe heart condition. Bette has little to do in this one. Written and directed by Howard Higgin.
