7792740,5,0793927579,"""To the Manor Born"" is absolutely the best comedy series I have ever seen. That is not hyperbole. I want copies of every episode because the repartee is witty and the situations so very deliciously clever. I hope  there will be future volumes to come because I will buy them immediately! I  don't know why the BBC hasn't made all the episodes available by now. This  is top-notch comedy and I'm sure there is a huge audience for the entire  series in the United States, which they haven't filled as yet. I first saw  ""To the Manor Born"" when it was on PBS and even before I bought  Volumes I and II, I remembered the situations and wit of this comedy  series. The only regret I have is that some of the episodes I remember well  are not included in the first two volumes. Come on, people! Get us Volume  III & IV!",914112000,2,813,4.261437908496732
7792741,5,0793927579,"You lucky people in America. This video is not available commercially in  the UK as yet, but its contents are well known to me. To The Manor Born has  been one of the all time great British comedy shows and it is as fresh  today as when it was first broadcast nearly 20 years ago. Penelope Keith  and Peter Bowles at their finest thanks to the excellent script writing of  Peter Spence. If only ALL 21 episodes were available on video, but this is  typical short sighted BBC  END",905990400,2,479,4.314606741573034
7792742,5,0793927579,"This, the second volume of the first season of To The Manor Born is again, funny and amusing.  Audrey fforbes-Hamilton continues to pick on Richard DeVere, the new owner of her once prized Grantleigh Manor.
Once you have seen the comedic antics of Audrey, it will leave you wanting more episodes on tape.  There are a total of 21 episodes but this tape contains episodes 5,6, and 7.
You'll love it!!  END",902361600,,404,4.583333333333333
