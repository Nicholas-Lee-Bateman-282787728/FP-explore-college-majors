I ordered this as a birthday present for my brother in law, ""today""(4/21) was his birthday. He was excited as hell to see the box and title but upon playing immediately told my sister; ""this is the wrong program. The one I want had Micheal Nouri in it"".So much for that present $15.00(including s&h) down the drain, sure it was a cheap gift this is my BROTHER IN LAW not BOYFRIEND!! plus this is a show he loves, it's priceless to him. So a word to the wise, if your want a documentary on Big Al and the boys fine, this will suit you to a t, however if you were looking to relive a moment in time 'so to speak'  through an early 80's miniseries based loosely on men in the 20's and 30's keep looking, Believe me I am, cause it's worth it. I don't think people will be on here in 20 plus years to buy Paris and Nicole, American (with the unknown singers) and the Apprentice. Who really cares,it's all pretty lame and boring anyways. Ahhh...  bring back the good old ""t.v. days!!"".",1114041600,20,1093,4.300970873786408
