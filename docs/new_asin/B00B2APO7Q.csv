8561294,5,B00B2APO7Q,"Excellent movie about love, seduction and rivalry. This is a riveting Bali-wood film filled with great acting, engaging  plot, wonderful music, beautiful photography and amazing scenery and full of action. It is a movie that will captivate and hold your attention from start to finish. We couldn't wait to buy it after seeing it at the theater. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1389052800,2,384,5.0

8561297,3,B00B2APO7Q,"I FINALLY get to see a Bollywood film in a theater and THIS is the one it turns out to be! What a disappointment. I've never had good luck when it comes to Abhishek Bachchan's films though and I'm beginning to understand why so many people complain about him being both stiff and hammy at the same time. (I used to think that those two things were mutually exclusive.) From the title RAAVAN I was expecting a film that was in some way a retelling of the Ramayana and that is what I got, but I was hoping for more of a period piece because I'm a sucker for costume flix. No dice, this one is definitely contemporary with Vikram playing a cop(the Ram character) out to rescue his wife in this version played by Aishwarya Rai who has been kidnapped by Raavan, Bachchan of course.

 The acting is barely adequate, and there is virtually no chemistry between Aish and Bachchan which is strange since they are married to each other in real life. As I mentioned earlier this is the 4th film of Bachchan's that I've seen and with each one I like him less and less. To be honest the only time I've enjoyed seeing him on film was a cameo in OM SHANTI OM in which he played himself. The worst part for me was that the music(always a prime concern in Bollywood films) wasn't given a fair shake. In fact the best song was over almost before it had begun which was extremely disappointing. On the plus side there is some beautiful scenery and the cinematographic does an excellent job of capturing it. worst of all the music is problematic with the best song ending almost before its started. If it hadn't been for the scenery I might very well have given this film 2 stars.",1281916800,5,1660,4.351612903225806
