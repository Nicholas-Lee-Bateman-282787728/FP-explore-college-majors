7882728,4,6305104573,"HELL'Z WINDSTAFF (1979) is an unsung kung fu classic that features four superb performers, three of whom are underrated, if not completely unknown, even among genre fans. There is an almost nonstop succession of fights, all very well staged and photographed on location and worked into the framework of a clever variation on a standard kung fu theme. In this one, a criminal gang plots to lure the young men from a Chinese town with promises of work in Borneo where a slave ring awaits. Two kung fu students and their teacher break up the gang's activities, but when the teacher is killed in a fight with the gang leader, the students must go into hiding to learn special techniques known as Rowing Oar and Dragon Hands from a reclusive master. Only by using those techniques in tandem will they be able to defeat the Devil Stick technique of the man who killed their teacher.
The young leads are Meng Hoi and Meng Yuan Man and their teacher is played by Jason Pai Piao. Their opponent is the venerable high-kicking Hwang Jang Lee who makes one of the most formidable kung fu villains I've ever seen. He is really tough to beat and both kung fu masters are killed trying. It takes the superhuman efforts of the two students to finally emerge victorious. Genuine kung fu skills, including a high degree of stick fighting, are mixed with acrobatics, but without the usual trampoline stunts or wire work. It's the real thing throughout and is captured on film in a straightforward manner, with no camera or editing tricks. The Arena release, part of the Wu Tang Collection, is both letter-boxed and in Cantonese with English subtitles, neither of which are announced on the video box. These desired features are rarities among old-school kung fu films released in the U.S. We can actually see all of the fighting in the frame and hear the actors' voices in their original language. This was an amazing find. Also known as DRAGON AND TIGER KIDS.",984009600,2,1941,4.711764705882353
