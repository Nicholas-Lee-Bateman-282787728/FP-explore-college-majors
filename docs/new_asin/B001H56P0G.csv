3624086,5,B001H56P0G,"My 3 year old son absolutely LOVES this DVD.  We borrowed it from the library (he picked it out), and I'm wondering now if I'll need to buy it (or just keep borrowing it), because he wants to watch it over and over and over.

It is so simple - just a bunch of trucks, tractors, construction equipment, etc. driving around doing what they do, to some goofy music.  It's gotta be one of the cheapest made DVDs I've ever watched, but highly entertaining for my heavy equipment loving little boy.",1233273600,3,492,4.384615384615385
3624087,5,B001H56P0G,"My grandson throughly enjoyed this DVD. He is a big fan of trucks
and this was a great movie which kept him engrossed the entire
time.",1227398400,,134,4.1923076923076925
3624108,5,B001H56P0G,Well what 7 yr old boy wouldn't just love a DVD about trucks? This guys son loves this DVD and watches it ALL the time.,1381363200,,119,3.8
3624109,5,B001H56P0G,Perfect for our 4 year old that LOVES trucks.  I believe it's 90 minutes long and he is glued to every second.,1372291200,,110,4.0
3624110,5,B001H56P0G,I understand from my niece that this dvd keeps the little one quite occupied.  He has not gotten bored with it.,1370822400,,111,4.285714285714286
3624111,3,B001H56P0G,"This movie is good, but not different enough from the original to make it worth owning both. The music is ""better"" in the first and it only has 1 section of remote control cars. This one has a bigger segment on remote control vehicles which is not very interesting.",1355961600,,265,4.428571428571429
3624112,5,B001H56P0G,"I bought this video along with Lots and Lots of Trucks, Volume 1.

My 29 month old is OBESSSED. The songs are catchy, the videos are great. It shows real trucks with the sounds, also while having music in the background only sometimes. Its the perfect mix... and he cannot look away. We watch them constantly... and honestly i think its better than the wiggles all the time lol.

I also bought the Mighty Machines videos, and i gotta say he doesnt like them. at all. When i play them he gets mad and demands this one lol.

If you have a little one obsessed with trucks, than look no further.",1354233600,,591,4.306306306306307
3624113,1,B001H56P0G,"I had ordered this for my grandson and was very disappointed in it.  It is nothing but songs and trucks and that is not what I expected when ordering this product.  I have attempted to send same back along with lots and lots of trucks vol 1.  both do not meet my expectations nor my grandson who is 7 years and and he even said ""grandma you have wasted your money.""  So I am attempting to return same if I could.",1346371200,,412,4.049382716049383
3624114,4,B001H56P0G,I bought 2 of the DVDs in this series for my almost-3-year-old. He likes them. The theme music is catchy and has gotten stuck in my head! Would recommend for any truck-lover.,1326153600,,174,4.46875
3624115,1,B001H56P0G,"Disk doesn't work, disappointing my child Christmas morning isn't what I had in mind. Won't send it back will cost too much.",1325116800,,124,4.681818181818182
3624116,5,B001H56P0G,My two year old son LOVES this DVD.  The theme song is catchy and exciting and different trucks are constantly going across the screen.  It isn't an educational DVD like some of the others I have purchased.  This is perfect for a two year old who just wants to see a LOT of trucks.,1298419200,,281,4.166666666666667

But the same style intro song seen on the commercial (you can check it out on youtube) runs through the entire video. We never watched it again. My two and a half year old just sat through it dazed never smiling. Mighty Machines is much more enjoyable.",1463443200,,425,4.461538461538462

8308056,5,B001H56P0G,"I have an 8 year old with autism and he absolutely loves these videos because they are real-life, not animated.  They are so realistic with all of the sights and sounds that he gets totally absorbed.  There is not a ridiculous amount of narration as in some others we own, so you really get to hear the sounds of life with those trucks.  Highly recommend!",1382486400,,355,4.430769230769231
