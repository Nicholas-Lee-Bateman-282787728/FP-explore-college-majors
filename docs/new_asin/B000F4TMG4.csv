8117547,4,B000F4TMG4,"I really enjoy these Something Weird classics, and this dvd is definitely in my top 5. Very campy of course.  These two movies are right on the cusp of being more racy, but 1968 is just a little too early for that. Not bad though. The peep extras are where we really get some exposure - one is full frontal and one is even more intimate (the girl is very relaxed and not demure, the camera is NOT SHY, and not just quick cuts, either). Great b&w time capsule, and the women are gorgeous if you're into the statuesque figures from the 60s.",1374624000,2,538,4.223300970873787
