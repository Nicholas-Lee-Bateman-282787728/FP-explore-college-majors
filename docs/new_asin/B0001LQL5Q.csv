8014138,5,B0001LQL5Q,"I am so happy to see this CD back on Amazon. My Grandfather is in this video. I knew about the program, but had never seen it. My mother had sent a few videos for me to see, and I didn't make the conection. I started to watch the tape, and suddenly I saw my grandfather playing his fiddle. I sat in the floor and cried. The memories of my childhood visits came rushing back. I could see the many times that people would come to my grandparents country store to ""make music"" with all of my father, and his father, and my uncle's, and anyone else who wanted to join in. Only a couple remain, but I will get to live them again, and pass on the heritage of my roots to my Grandchildren, brings joy to my heart. Thank you Mr Lunsford and Mr Hoffman for believing that this was important enough to pass down to future generations.",1391731200,3,824,4.15625

8014143,5,B0001LQL5Q,"Unbelievable artists depicted in this film. Over the river and through the woods the old dirt road leads us deeper into the back country of 1960s
Carolinas. These people knew how to party! Dancing, singing and some mean fiddle playing. Who knew such spirit and TALENT could be found out there.",1189036800,6,293,4.764705882352941
