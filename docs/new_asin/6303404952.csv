These companions only have basic programming but are made to be able to learn through Internet access. She spoke of love to her companion and he wanted her to be happy because she seemed so sad all the time. He started learning about true love on the internet one night. Romeo & Juliet, etc.......and everything changed!
Awesome psychological thriller!!!
Lets just say he became obsessed & possessive!

7850494,5,6303404952,"It's taken me years to track this down - I remember seeing this made-for-tv movie years ago on daytime tv.  It was absolutely brilliant - a woman writer suffering from writer's block hires a robot (Bruce Greenwood) to do the hard work and heads out to the mountains to write her next novel. Frustrated with his limited conversation (""What is it with you and syntax?"") - she decides to upgrade him with 'interesting' results.  Geoffrey the robot is very attractive and the more she ratchets up his abilities, the more is revealed about the conflicts between men and women, the expectations we demand of each other that even a robot can never fully deliver.

The film is tongue-in-cheek, but harrowing and sad too.  Be careful what you ask for of a 'person' because you might just get it, in spades!

Bruce Greenwood is outstanding in this movie.  Why are made-for-tv movies so under-rated?  This one is terrific and SHOULD GO TO DVD NOW!!",1264809600,6,937,4.711656441717792
7850495,2,6303404952,Watching Kathryn Harrold is a pleasant way to spend an hour or two.  Predictable plot but not entirely a bust.,1251331200,,110,4.5
7850496,5,6303404952,"I just wish they would release this on dvd.  Great fun, I loved the old made for tv USA movies they made back in the 80's and 90's.  Bruce Greenwood is a total hottie in this one and did a fantastic job of making you feel badly for his character while being scary.",1236038400,4,264,3.9622641509433962
