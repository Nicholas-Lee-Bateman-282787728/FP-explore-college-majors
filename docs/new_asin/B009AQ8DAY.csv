5309543,1,B009AQ8DAY,Absolutely horrible!!!!!!! I've seen better acting on reality TV. Even a group of 9 year olds could sit through the first 20 minutes.,1385683200,2,133,4.826086956521739
5309544,1,B009AQ8DAY,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen.  I felt tricked by the trailer as the movie is poorly written, poorly acted and the pace is so slow that my kids were done at about the 12 minute mark.  While the actors are clearly new and inexperienced, the real trouble is the writing as they are given vocabulary that doesn't make sense to them nor to the age of the audience watching the movie.

Many scenes seem to drag on forever with no real contribution to the plot of the film.  Continuity errors, writing that is reminiscent of a sophomoric film made by preteens on a camcorder and acting that will make you wonder if they're actually reading their lines off of cue cards give this movie a perfect ""0"" stars from me.  (Sorry I had to give it 1 star because they made me do it)

Believe me, if you're looking at the other reviews and thinking you might want to give this shitbox a try, I assure you that those other reviews are just being overly kind, were producers on the film or are downright out of their minds.",1384646400,8,1014,4.282722513089006
5309545,2,B009AQ8DAY,"Bad acting and a very boring plot. Did not keep the kids attention, or mine either.  Trailer was better than movie.",1376265600,4,115,4.476190476190476
5309546,5,B009AQ8DAY,"This was a fun movie for the whole family! Though I had never seen any of these actors in the past, my kids are always open for a fun film, especially when it comes to spooky places and things. The movie itself was enjoyable and the acting was pretty good for new actors. This reminds me some of the movies I have been watching with my girls on the Disney Channel, but really, overall, it was simply a fun family film that all will enjoy!",1359244800,2,438,4.1647058823529415

5309553,2,B009AQ8DAY,"Well, it could've used a better soundtrack... the children were better actors than the adults.
WHY is the blond star of this movie only shown with her back to the camera on the cover-
art?
Played like a back-to-school special, it was okay. Thank God it was only 77-minutes.",1438819200,,273,4.591836734693878

5309560,1,B009AQ8DAY,"I know it seems pointless giving something a review without looking at it first, but I already feel like the cover itself is a knockoff of Monster House. The movie could be like Monster House too. If you haven't seen Monster House, please do so (if you want). It's not 100% super duper good but it's far more decent in terms of something worth watching. And judging from the reviews I've seen, this Ghost Trap doesn't look too smart. (Not criticizing the people that do enjoy this, it's just how I feel).",1412899200,,504,4.489130434782608

5309562,4,B009AQ8DAY,"This is an amusingly diverting movie, with an interesting premise, with young girl scientist high school student having a run-in with an old woman occult believer who has trapped ghosts in her house.

There are parts that drag, but if you're reading e-mail while you watch the movie, it will seem to fly by.

Some of the characters could have been played better, but maybe the producers were trying for a boring science teacher who happens to have invented stuff that can see and capture ghosts.

It is a funny movie. If you need a diversion some evening, try this out. If you don't care for it after ten minutes, you've only lost ten minutes.

I enjoyed it.",1408579200,2,658,4.5508474576271185
5309563,1,B009AQ8DAY,This movie was joke. You would have to be blind and deaf while on serious drugs to enjoy this at all. Ghost trap...more like ghost crap!,1406937600,,136,4.269230769230769
5309564,2,B009AQ8DAY,"Ghost Trap (AKA Little Ghost Getter) is a low-budget film with little going for it.  Shot for a buck twenty-nine and some Green Stamps, the effects, acting, editing, and script never manage to take flight.  I bought the film from a video store in the cheapie, used, section.  I thought it might be cute, but it is no Girl Vs. Monster (a Disney flick that also shadows Ghostbusters).  The reviewer who said it makes Ed Wood (of Planet 9 from Outer Space) look like Shakespeare was spot on.  Having watched the movie, I doubt I will view it ever again, unless I wish to torture someone into a confession.

In an unusual move for a direct to video release, the original soundtrack by Livingwithanangel has been released on CD, and MP3, as Ghost Trap (Ost) [ASIN: B003QZ6UJG ] with the Ghost Trap Theme, BarageGand (revisited), Let's Do This, I Love To Boogie (Jig Mix), Dangerous, Capture Rapture, Ghost Trap Theme (instrumental), Effectively Yours, Ghost Dog (edit), Gearing Up, The Courtroom, Dazed and Confused, Arrivals and Departures, & The Capturing Suite.  The music is not inspiring and sounds more on the order of cheap video game sound.

[Here there be spoilers]

The plot itself starts alright; a bright young student, named Cynthia Carter, creates a small rocket as part of a science project.  Two of her friends speculate if this experiment will result in disaster as so many others have. Upon firing the rocket it it quickly goes out-of-control and causes a number of accidents each of which build into a Rube Goldberg sequence resulting in an old woman, named Isabelle Gotham, being injured by a skateboard.  Cynthia is before a judge with a lawyer saying Mrs. Gotham wants the kid sent away to prison for her crimes; the judge decides to sentence Cynthia to community service by helping Mrs. Gotham with meals, cleaning, and anything else until the is able to help herself.  Cynthia keeps hearing a dog, where there is not dog and noises where there are no people.  We quickly discover that Mrs. Gotham is involved in the occult, but it turns out she is only trying to contact her dead husband and clear his name.  She needs 3 people to summon her husband and has managed to capture 3 ghosts:  Me-Myself-and-I, a Librarian Ghost, and a Judge Ghost (who for some reason wears an English barristers wig) to help, but the connection cannot be established.  How does one call up 3 spirits, but cannot call up another?  I have no idea.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch er school, the science teacher shows Cynthia a device that allows the wearer to see electromagnetic energy and, when she tried it on, sees Me-Myself-&-I.  In cleaning the basement, Cynthia manages to capture the ghost dog and takes it to the teacher.  The dog escapes, but the teachers devices do hold it briefly and the three children are equipped with gadgets go back to the house and taking care of business.  Me-Myself-&-I, has to be caught three times (which is never explained, but then they never explain why he is eating stuff from the refrigerator either.)  During the chase a picture falls off the wall and reveals a letter proving Mr. Gotham was innocent, but that the current mayor of the town did the crime.  A brief reunion between the husband and wife ensues and he leaves.  The Judge Ghost walks Cynthia through a court proceeding to vacate the conviction of Mr. Gotham and start an investigation of the mayor.",1402704000,5,3400,4.733446519524618
