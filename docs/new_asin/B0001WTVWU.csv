2035129,3,B0001WTVWU,"Be prepared for a YOUNG tour guide who spends quite a bit of time shouting woo hoo and leaping on her bed in the hotel room.  She even goes so far as to ask an elderly pipe player if he's wearing anything under his kilt.  I think she was trying to produce a hip tour video, which I can appreciate, but still ...

This video does get better once she's out of Glasgow and touring the countryside.  There is quite a bit of beautiful scenery, and she does cover the highlights.  We're planning a first trip and are really trying to get an idea of things to do and see, so for that purpose, this video is ok.",1109548800,26,603,4.076271186440678
2035130,2,B0001WTVWU,This is one of the few Globe Trekker shows I did not like. It seemed rushed. They used two hosts on this show which caused them to bounce back and forth loosing plot lines. But the good points are great video shots of the beautiful and exciting city of London. The DVD is worth that alone.,1100131200,12,289,4.178571428571429
2035131,5,B0001WTVWU,"This is one of the episodes from PBS's Globe Trekker series. This gives a nice over view of Amsterdam with extras of travel advice. The video was shot around August/September, so the footage is of events going on at the time.

Best part about the Blobe Trekker series is not only beautiful video, But also the humor they add to it as well.",1099008000,8,339,4.380952380952381
2035171,5,B0001WTVWU,After reading some of the negative reviews I don't see how they panned it  Ive been to Scotland a half dozen times and I think they covered it brilliantly for an hour show!  Megan McCormick was a spark plug [ flirtacious sassy  spirited and easy on the eyes!]  I paid under $10 so it was money well spent at twice the price!,1360713600,,324,4.17741935483871
2035172,3,B0001WTVWU,"Megan Mccormick is a complete twit. She's the most worthless, immature reviewer of all the Globe Trekkers - some of whom are quite good, such as Justine Shapiro and Zay Harding.

2035174,3,B0001WTVWU,"Globe Trekkers is a show about a group of young travelers who visit countries throughout the world. It is not a travel guide for a specific city (if that's what you're looking for, get the Frommer's books). It is more of a Carmen San Diego-type adventure.

Megan McCormick stars in this episode. I find her to be very annoying. She tries to inject humor into every situation. She is a smart woman- she knows a lot of facts and gave a coherent description of the feud between Taiwan and China. However, she acts like an airhead.

This episode begins at a hotel in Hong Kong. She got the room for $24, but it was a decent room with a nice view. She then rode a tram which was scenic. I was surprised at the fact that many Hong Kong residents know English. She stopped by the Shenzen Economic Zone, which was like Canal Street on steroids. She then went to a tai-chi class (could've skipped that). I liked the special effects school she went to. I'm normally not a fan of Megan's lame attempts at humor, but she did a moonwalk after she went shopping for clothes and that was hilarious.

She ate at a Dim Sum place. The food looked delicious. The next day, she went paragliding. The next stop was Taiwan. She got a room at the Grand Hotel for $150 (a bargain, compared to the prices in NYC or London). She visited the Taipei 101 while it was under construction (I wish they made this DVD later when the Taipei 101 was completed). A cute Asian lady showed her around the Taipei Night Market (I wish she was the host of this episode). The funniest part was when she went to the red light district known as Snake Alley (Taiwanese people view snake blood as an Aphrodisiac). The owner of a store put a snake around Megan. She panicked and shouted, ""Oh sh**!"" (it was not edited). The next day, she visited a Buddhist Monastery.

Overall, I enjoyed this DVD. It would've been better if someone other than Megan was the host (the only Globe Trekker host I despise more is Justine Shapiro since she complains about everything). Megan looked good in this episode (in other episodes, she looked too skinny).",1352246400,,2095,4.447916666666667
2035175,3,B0001WTVWU,"I'm planning a trip to the UK where we will be staying in Scotland for part of the time and are interested in Edinburgh and day trips that would be interesting.  This dvd gets a 4 for sheer fun and the spirit of adventure that the guide provides.  She is young, energetic and up for anything.  Just how travel should be.  Now, would I say this really gave me a lot of sites that I need to add to my agenda?  Eh, not so much.  She covers most of the major areas in Scotland and a very small slice of each, so it isn't really possible to get much of an idea where you would want to spend your time.  The sites she does visit are beautifully photographed and her exuberant nature make you want to go wherever she is going, but as a travel guide, it didn't really help me much. It was more of a fun dvd to watch to see the scenery on a a dvd than a dvd I could really take any notes on must see things.

Overall, to just watch it was fun, but if you are looking for a more useful dvd I would go to Rick Steves or my new favorite, Samantha Brown.",1340582400,,1041,3.9004739336492893
2035176,3,B0001WTVWU,"I am currently researching and watching travel videos for the UK and came across the Globe Trekker series.  I have not watched any of the other installments, so cannot compare it to any of those but here are the thoughts from someone planning a trip...

I enjoyed seeing some of the sites of London and thought they were well photographed.  I don't know that it helped me much on planning anything per se, but it was a fun video to watch some unique areas/things to do.  The sites are a bit of a mish-mash, Westmister Abbey is almost just a blink, but then they spent quite a bit of time on a man made flying machine contest that appeared to be off the beaten path.  Also covered was a festival, Camden Market, Notting Hill, St. Pauls, an Indian Temple, Harrods, Soho, Ascot and Buckingham Palace and its guards, among other sites.

There are two guides on your trip, one young woman, who I found energetic, fun and great to watch even when she was covering something that was a little on the ""goofy"" side. The other guide is a guy, who was fine, just not quite as energetic and seemed to be trying to be funny but wasn't quite able to pull it off.  One person would have worked better in my opinion.

If you would like to see some different sides of London away from the usual you might want to check out some of the sites that they show.  If you are looking for a dvd of more travel and tourist sites and more in depth coverage I would probably recommend Rick Steves or Samantha Brown from the Travel Channel.  Both do an excellent job of showing you somehow just what you want to see and tell you what you need to know to really enjoy your trip.

Overall a fair rating.  I was expecting more, but the sites were interesting, just not what I was ultimately looking for.",1339632000,,1771,4.317220543806647
2035177,2,B0001WTVWU,"This program is a very superficial view of Scotland's people and its sights and sounds.  It's very ""touristy,"" touching on the standard cliches, such as haggis and what folks wear under their kilts.  The program sadly offers little depth on Scotland's history.  For example, William Wallace is mentioned but depicted only as the Braveheart film character.  The accompanying music is by no means rousing; non-descript filler type that doesn't scratch the surface of Scotland's musical depths.  As mentioned by others, the female host is annoying, and she even mispronounces some of the Scottish place names.  If you are looking for a good travelogue of Scotland, I would recommend looking at other options.",1337817600,2,705,5.25
2035178,3,B0001WTVWU,"When I borrowed a copy of this DVD from my local library, I didn't initially realize that that it was part of the Globe Trekker travel collection.  I'm generally ambivalent about the travel shows produced by Globe Trekker, and I became even more skeptical when I realized that the host was Megan McCormick.  I've seen her on previous shows, and the first thought that ran through my head was ""Oh no, not this annoying woman!""  In the end, however, she was better than I expected - not great, but palatable. (However, after watching the DVD a second time, I have to agree with other reviewers that she seems to be insipidly shouting ""woo hoo!"" somewhat regularly throughout the documentary, and it does become annoying).  Perhaps the biggest flaw with the DVD is that they attempt to cover nearly all of the regions of Scotland in one hour - this is pure folly!  I've been to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and these two cities alone are worthy of their own multiple disc series.  They really should have only selected one city or a single region if they were restricted to only one hour.
I was very much looking forward to the coverage of the Orkney Islands and other northern regions of the country.  However, in the end, nothing is covered in any sort of depth; all that the viewer is given is a generally shallow, and somewhat stereotypical view of this wonderful country.  It's too bad.",1331596800,3,1382,4.635245901639344
2035179,4,B0001WTVWU,"To begin with, I read about some other reviewer's annoyance with Megan jumping on a bed yelling woo-hoo. I don't know if what I have is a later, earlier, or newly edited edition, but that is not on it. Megan does sort of fall into a bed when she checks into a nice hotel, and says shes likes the bed, but no jumping on it, so something has changed. In the version I have, she is a bit over-the-top and wide eyed during the intro, but that appears to be done tongue-in-cheek, it looks like she is doing it intentionally and expects the audience to know she is doing it intentionally. She is Globe Trekker's 2nd most popular host, and I personally find her style appealing, perhaps that is more the case for men than for women.

The details of Megan's travels are a bit too brief for my taste. There is some good info there, but it could use a bit more depth. The DVD is only 60 minutes, and probably would have been a bit better at 90 or even 120. I believe those lengths could have been achieved by merely spending a bit of extra time in each place, and with extended interviews with some of the people Megan met. One thing I feel may be of limited value to a lot of travellers is when she goes to a couple of events which are only held annually, or only during certain months. This was also true of Rick Steves' Scotland. Coverage of such special events should not necessarily be omitted, but considering most tourists will not be there during those specific time frames, perhaps there should be less time spent on them.",1297123200,4,1521,4.318181818181818
2035180,1,B0001WTVWU,"I was somewhat disappointed by this video.
It's been over 30 day and I can hardly remember any of it, except the bagpipe lesson.
Would have liked to have seen more of the houses, shops, every day living etc.  I'll try National Geographic.",1269216000,,238,4.534883720930233
2035200,2,B0001WTVWU,"I've been a fan of the Globe Trekker series, and I always liked Megan McCormick. However, this video was disappointing. There isn't a logical narrative to this video. As others have complained, having two hosts didn't work.

What does it say when I forgot I owned this video until I stumbled across it?

It didn't offer me surprises or compelling reasons to visit a place that hasn't been better covered by others like Rick Steves.",1241568000,3,431,4.733333333333333

You will watch this DVD primarily to decide if the host,Megan Mccormick,is really as silly and immature as she seems.

2035202,2,B0001WTVWU,This DVD contains nothing new about London.  It is disappointingly short and contains predictable video of the same old tourist spots in London.  Don't waste your money.,1228089600,,169,5.222222222222222
2035203,4,B0001WTVWU,"I know some of the reviewers here have blasted this DVD for not showing the real Amsterdam. Well, I'd agree with that in part. It barely touches the Rijksmuseum, and they acknowledge that the Van Gogh museum was being renovated when it was shot. They never go to Dam Square, you see one shot outside Central Station, and there's zero information on getting around town on anything other than a bike. And my gosh, WHERE WAS ANNE FRANK'S HOUSE?! With that said, however, I loved this DVD. I think Amsterdam is an amazing city. Sure it's beautiful, and sure it has some amazing culture. But what I like so much about the city is its funky uniqueness. There's nowhere else like it on earth! This DVD shows you why. The coffee shops are a fact of life in Amsterdam, and I've always thought travel shows tip-toe around them and the legal marijuana they sell. This one dives right in and shows you an Amsterdam coffee shop. Amsterdam is terribly progressive and is one of the rare cities in the world that doesn't judge human beings based on who they choose to sleep with. So why not show a vibrant gay community and the straights in the city who tolerate and live with them in harmony? There's no other city on EARTH where scenes like that could be found - not even San Francisco. The Red Light District is equally unique to Amsterdam. This DVD takes you there and shows you that, although Amsterdam is quite safe, you've still got to use good judgment in terms of where you go and to whom you speak. Will this DVD be the best you ever see to show you all the tourist spots in Amsterdam? Probably not. But will it give you a flavor for one of the world's most unique cities in a way that's far superior to other travel DVDs? Absolutely. I recommend it highly.",1203552000,2,1753,4.41358024691358
2035204,4,B0001WTVWU,"Very good for basic info on London.  Wish they could have spent a little more time at each destination.  Video could have been a little longer.  Overall, a good product.",1196035200,4,169,4.566666666666666
2035205,1,B0001WTVWU,"I've been to Amsterdam and it's a beautiful city.  Unfortunately, this item doesn't show the beauty of the place.  You'll like it if you're gay, smoke pot, and like staying in flop houses.",1181520000,4,188,4.666666666666667
2035206,4,B0001WTVWU,"This could have been an even better DVD of
Scotland had they hired a less obnoxious tour
guide. Meagan McCormick was more of a distraction
and could have used more tact and subtlety. One gets
the impression that the Scots she interviewed seemed
rather annoyed by her overzealousness. But, I knew what
I was in store for when the flighty guide jumped
onto her hotel room bed while yelling ""Woo-hoo!""

With the tour guide issue aside, this is a very good
look at the beautiful green country of Scotland, its
culture and highlights. Along the trip we meet several
interesting people, such as the woman who plays soothing
tunes on her violin to curious seals. Also, we get a quick
visit to Great Britain's largest fresh water lake, Loch
Ness, where a man has dedicated his life to finding the Loch
Ness monster, or ""Nessie"" as they sometimes call the mythical
serpent. And of course we get some history on bagpipes,
cuisine, Scotland festival games and reenactments of Scotland's
revered warrior and hero, William Wallace. This is a nicely
shot film and moves at a good pace and is well worth the viewing.",1174867200,13,1101,4.704663212435233
2035207,1,B0001WTVWU,"The film spends about 60% of the film on the gay scene, in fact it says that 40% of the center is not straight, lousy cafe service, crumby markets, raw herring, not sushi, just raw herring deboned and swallowed slime and all, and bycicles and bycicles, and rows and rows of boring looking flats along canals, no wonder the drugs are legal, one probalby needs that to keep from going bonkers, I had planned a trip to Amsterdam based on internet data, but nothing showed all this, I'm from New York this place looks dinky from this film.

8017262,4,B0001WTVWU,"I didn't know much about Amsterdam prior to watching this episode. My two favorite European cities are London and Paris. However, I wanted to expand my horizons. Amsterdam is an interesting city. This episode was good, but could've been better.

The host is a bit of a buffoon. At times, I felt like I was laughing at him instead of laughing with him. He thought it was a good idea to ride a bike on the tram tracks. A tram literally came within 5 feet of him. He also got hit by a boat while he was paddling on the canal. The episode began with him getting off a train and heading to a hotel. He tried to speak to the taxi driver in Dutch, but the driver told him to speak in English. After staying at the aptly-named Hemp Hotel, he headed to the Gay Pride Parade. I have nothing against the LGBT community, but it seems like this episode (and this series in general) tried to force the gay agenda down our throats.

Jonathan said that bike thefts were common in Amsterdam. Despite putting two locks on his bike, it was still stolen. A scruffy looking dude was caught stealing a bike that belonged to a tourist. I loved the part with the canal. I learned that some people actually live in houses along the canal. Jonathan left the downtown tourist area and headed to a rave in a seedy part of town (it seems like half the episode consisted of people smoking weed).

He stopped by the Riksmuseum (sp?), though it was only a cursory tour. He later stopped by a beautiful park. Like London, Amsterdam is a diverse city. I saw whites hanging out with blacks and Asians. In the next scene, he went to the Red Light District where some drug pushers nearly robbed him before the cops arrived. Towards the end, he hung out with a gay black dude and attended a gay wedding.

I felt that this DVD focused a little too much on the LGBT community and marijuana. Nevertheless, it was an interesting tour of Amsterdam. The bike ride was cool and I loved the canals and art work.",1361145600,2,1965,4.346049046321526
