8240172,4,B00113ALLI,"Personally, i really like the newer Curious George series, but someone bought this one for my kids and they really love it.  It's the old fashioned type of book animation, with non-moving pictures and a narrator telling the story, but, hey, my kids don't seem to care.  There are a few other books on this dvd as well, they are cute stories, but don't seem to hold my kids' interest for very long.",1205366400,6,397,4.424657534246576
