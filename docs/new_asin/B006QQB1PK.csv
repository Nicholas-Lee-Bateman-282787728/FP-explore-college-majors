8503100,5,B006QQB1PK,"This arrived in perfect condition and plays perfectly on a DVD in the US.  This is a classic set and was originally filmed in 1961 so it was of historical significance.  This is also a cultural treasure and must be viewed with appreciation for culture.  The subtitles in English work nicely.  The set has 20 DVDs.  I am very pleased with this DVD set. It is a rare find.  On the back of each DVD case there is a list of episodes on the DVDs in the case and the title of each episode, such as the Birth and childhood of Shri Ram, Shri Ram and Sita behold each other in the royal garden... The set tells the epic story of the Ramayana",1377648000,,632,4.097560975609756
