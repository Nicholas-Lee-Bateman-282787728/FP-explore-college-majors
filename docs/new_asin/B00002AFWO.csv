1251803,2,B00002AFWO,"This video set does accomplish what it advertises, but I was disappointed. This really is a workout set; it will not teach you bellydancing. Moreover,  it's not a very exciting workout. When I began the first tape, I was  thinking, ""Boy, this is a boring warm-up."" Turned out it wasn't  the warm-up, it was the actual routine. They are graceful routines, and you  WILL get a workout; my arms were exhausted before halfway into Arms &  Abs and I was really sweating during Fat Burning, but I have to say that  it's really a dull set of workouts. They are so *repetitive*; you begin  doing one arm move or one step and you *keep* doing the same thing for  thirty seconds or more (I counted), and then you just switch sides! Thirty  seconds may not seem like a particularly long time, but when you're used to  routines that keep adding things or changing after sixteen counts, or  putting stuff together at the end of a sequence, trust me, you're muttering  ""Borrrrring..."" at the TV screen. I *am* using the tapes,  nevertheless; to do half of one is to get a good warm-up before doing some  belly dancing routines, and the dancing the twins do at the beginning and  end of the tapes is giving me some choreography ideas, but I wouldn't  really recommend the tape set if you want to learn belly dancing, or if  you're used to workout routines that will show you moves and put them  together to keep things interesting.  Good things about the tapes: Most of  them are low-impact, you can do the routines barefoot (I love that!), you  will learn graceful moves (particularly arm moves), they break down some  belly dance moves so you can see how they are done, and they are easy to  learn. And Neena and Veena are lovely to watch. If you want to learn  bellydance, though, get Shamira's workout or Atea's tapes.",969408000,,1807,4.540372670807454
1251804,5,B00002AFWO,"This video set is absolutely wonderful!  I am restarting an exercise program and these tapes are fun, lively, and enjoyable.  The moves are  sensual and graceful. Neena and Veena guide the beginner through all the  exercises. I also appreciated the voice over information about the basics  of this graceful exotic art. You'll never go to the gym again! For women  who believe they must sweat it out on machines for physical fitness, try  these tapes.  Not only do I feel stronger and healthier, I appreciately my  womanly curves which help my belly dance!",965088000,14,555,4.881720430107527
1251805,5,B00002AFWO,"I can only reiterate what has already been said in the positive reviews. Well filmed,well edited,well produced. A joy to watch and a joy to practice with. Clear and concise direction. I don't know if you can get in shape with  these videos alone but they are so much fun who cares. DANCE your heart  out!",961632000,3,304,4.410714285714286
1251806,4,B00002AFWO,"Wow!  I love these 4 videos.  What's not to love... these girls are friendly and energetic, the way the take you through the 'workout' is fun and I still work up a sweat, and the dance routine at the end is just  breathtaking!  One thing to remember is that this is a workout video and  not an dance instructional, if you want to learn to dance take a class!",958694400,10,358,4.130434782608695
1251807,5,B00002AFWO,"I recently moved and I bought this set to keep my muscles toned for bellydancing while I find instruction in my new home town.  These tapes are perfect for that because they are exactly what the title proclaims them to  be -- a fitness workout for beginning bellydancers.
  If you are looking  for a fun exercise program, I think these tapes are wonderful.  Because  this is a dance form there are always more movement layers to add on so  there is no chance for boredom to kick in.  For begining bellydancers,  these tapes cover the basics at an easy to follow pace.  These are basics  that will translate into any bellydancing class you take (and after getting  a taste from these tapes you will want more). For the most part, the dances  done by the twins at the beginning of each tape are learnable for the  beginner after mastering the moves in the instruction part of the tape.
  For those who are looking for something beyond basic moves: at the end  of each tape, during the credits, is an exquisite solo performance in full  regalia.  On at least one of the tapes there are two dances (one with a  sword and one with a cane) so don't turn off the tapes too early.  These  professional performances are only a few minutes of the tape.
  The  quality of the video and sound is professional--not grainy or sloppy.  The  voice over instruction is soothing.  Not all belly dance tapes are this  professionally produced.  The twins move gracefully and are lovely to  watch.
  I would love to see the twins put out a longer beginner's tape  (hour long) with perhaps a dance sequence specifically taught.  I would  definitely buy a zil (finger cymbol) instruction video if they made one, as  well as tapes with more complex moves -- perhaps where they took more  advantage of the dance floor than these 1/2 hour basic instruction videos  allow.",957571200,30,1845,4.591331269349845
1251808,5,B00002AFWO,"I have been bellydancing for 2 years and wanted something to give me consistent practice at home. These tapes are simply the BEST! I get a great workout (you will be sore), and I perfect and learn new moves at the same  time. As as for Neena and Veena's routnies at the end of each tape, they  are the best I've ever seen. Real motivation, ladies!",956707200,16,347,4.242424242424242
1251820,5,B00002AFWO,"I love these videos!  The first week I had them, I lost five pounds.  They make excercising fun, and they work very well in conjunction with bellydance classes.  My teacher has praised my progress, and I attribute that to the videos as well.  Get them!",1051920000,2,252,4.533333333333333
1251821,5,B00002AFWO,"This set was the first set of bellydancing tapes I ever bought, but as soon as I finished the first tape, I knew I was hooked. These workouts are FUN and you can really feel it working, plus they make you feel ""sensual"" and ""sexy!"" Sometimes the moves are a little awkward at first, but with practice, you get the hang of them. These tapes teach you some moves that are used in bellydancing, but not really bellydancing itself, so you should not expect that you are going to become an expert bellydancer with these. I try to do two tapes a day, three days a week (I have added some other Veena/Neena & Rania tapes to my collection), and I have been keeping up with this routine for about 9 months, which is the longest I've ever been able to keep up an exercise routine. Three of the tapes, do not offer much in the way of Cardio workouts, but are good for toning. I have lost a little weight, and I probably would have lost more had I tried harder. Overall, these are my favorite exercise tapes. If you are wanting something different than the same old aerobics stuff, give these a try -- you might be surprised.",1051315200,,1113,4.304761904761905
1251822,5,B00002AFWO,"If you bothered to read the box, it says ""Bellydance FITNESS"". What did you think that meant? If you wanted just bellydancing you should have bought the ""Sensual Art of Bellydance"" set instaed of the FITNESS set.
If you legitimately did not like the videos for lack of cardio fitness or just plain didn't like them then this comment is not for you. But you crybabies out there should pay attention to what you're buying next time.",1045526400,2,430,4.597402597402597
1251823,5,B00002AFWO,"I love this set.  Every video is a complete workout and the fat burner is excellent.  You have 4 videos so you are never bored and always looking forward to the next day.  I enjoy them very much.  They are fun, easy and really work.  I do them 4 days a week.  Sometimes 2 times a day.",1034640000,2,284,3.8947368421052633
1251824,5,B00002AFWO,"I purchased the boxed set a few weeks back, but I'm just now really getting into them.  I started with the arms and abs, and my arms are really burning after just 30 minutes of working out. I've found they go at a nice, steady pace. But don't take that to mean you won't sweat. Some of the moves are a little hard to get at first, but I practice in front of a mirror and try to imitate what I see them doing until I'm satisfied with it. I've seen people complaining that they're not learning any bellydance moves. It's fitness for beginners. You're learning the basics to help you lose weight. These movies weren't created to turn you into a bellydance Primadonna. I definitely recommend this if you're looking for a steady workout that really does isolate the specific parts of the body.",1034121600,3,788,4.43448275862069
1251825,5,B00002AFWO,"First of all let me say that I am completely out of shape thanks to a torn cartilage in my knee, and a broken coccyx bone that has finally healed.  It's been over 2 years since I did any form of exercise.  The exercise movements in these videos are great for the out of shapers, like me.  The movements are slow and controlled, so it's not like you're gonna pull a muscle. Because it's done slowly you won't lose the pace of the exercise.  I hate it when some exercise videos go so fast that they're on the next move and you haven't finished the first. Even though it was slow, I still felt I got a great exercise without killing myself. My one piece of advice to you though is, make sure you wear a bra. LOL...  but, you don't need shoes and you don't need a mat to work on. I think it's an excellent workout video.  Oh, the video is really clear,and the verbal instructions are given slowly and understandably.",1030060800,3,912,4.242774566473988
1251826,5,B00002AFWO,"I just wanted to put my two cents in.  I am well over weight (I am talking over 300 lbs) I bought this because I know I had to lose weight, I had knee surgery and my weight alone has stopped me from healing.  I love this video.  I do it every day and on some of the knee moves I cant do I try something else.  I have always been in loving with belly dancing and I don't feel like I am working out.  I have not really change my eating habits and I have lost 21 lbs.  My husband is loving how my body is changing and toning.  I love the fact that my jeans are so big on me I can take them off without unbuttoning them.  I just purchased the basic dance.  I cant wait to explore.  I just want to thank those two girls for their creativity and gracefulness.  I work hard to mimic their movements and when my weight is gone I am going to belly dance for my husband for our 17th year anniversary",1027987200,8,889,3.856353591160221
1251827,5,B00002AFWO,"... I ordered the ""Fitness for Beginners"" box set.
I must say that these videos are a BREATH OF FRESH AIR.  Not only do you feel sensual as you learn the moves, but you also realize that ""HEY! I CAN DANCE!!""  Further, Neena and Veena keep you interested with tips and ideas, while the music helps keep you upbeat and ready for more.
I strongly recommend this video to EVERY WOMAN who wants to tone up, get stronger and get more flexible--- all while being sensual and feeling feminine.  What could be better???",1024272000,8,510,4.462365591397849
1251828,5,B00002AFWO,"I am an overweight diabetic who has to exercise to maintain health and prevent complications from my disease.  Finding exercise that is fun and rewarding is difficult, and Neena and Veena are lifesavers!  I have been doing Basic Moves, Fat Burning, Arms and Abs and Slim Down for several months, and plan to order their dance tapes ASAP.  They work muscle groups nobody else does, and work the arms and abs like nobody else.  Some of the moves in Fat Burning and Slim Down are difficult and repetitive, your calves will burn.  So keep going with the tape and DO THE COOL DOWN AND STRETCHES AFTERWARD, or your legs will burn...  If you do the stretches, you will be ok, and your legs will get some great toning, not to mention your arms, hips abs and back.  MY posture has really improved, and I feel better about myself everytime I finish a tape.  Also, I love the fact they are not talking the whole time and not spouting too much ""feel the burn"" stuff like some tapes, or too much new age goo like others (I love new age concepts, but not while I'm trying to sweat)  Buy these tapes and have fun!",1024185600,4,1098,4.369458128078818
1251829,5,B00002AFWO,"I really love these tapes. They certainly give you a nice workout. The quality of the picture is very clear and the camera work is excellent. This set will teach you certain bellydance moves but ,as stated on the cover they are mainly for fitness, not dance instruction. The basic moves tape is a nice primer for the other tapes but one word of caution...take it easy on the head slides until you get used to it. Arms and abs is challenging but effective. Hips, buns and thighs is fun and lets you feel the burn. Fat burning I found a little hard but you just have to go at your own pace...as they suggest. I think this set is a steal considering the quality,the lovely teaching style of the girls and the great fun and joy it's brought to my life.",1023148800,4,748,4.274647887323944
1251840,4,B00002AFWO,"I like doing this tape accompanied with another, more intense video tape. Or sometimes I merely do the tape twice. It's not a very intense workout. Very low impact. But it is quite a bit of fun. I'd say it's good for those who haven't been in the exercise game for a while. And for those who are in pretty good shape, this is a great video on one of your majorly light days, or just for one of your fun days. Belly Dancing really does bring out a Fun, Sensual side to you! The girls in the video are nice and it's an overall low stress workout.",1021593600,3,544,4.046296296296297
1251841,2,B00002AFWO,"These women are great dancers but they are not great aerobic instructors.  Their warm-ups are not long enough to get you sufficiently warmed up enough.  I found that my muscles were locking up halfway through the video.  The movements are also too isolated.  I know that doesn't sound right... what I mean is that if you have an injury like I do, the amount of time the spend holding variations of the same movement wears out my muscles.  I cannot hold my arms up in the air for any great length of time.  This is a good portion of the workout.  They workout the arms then the torso then the legs.  If they had spaced out their movements and worked out different muscle groups at ""random"" instead of in isolation I could have done these videos.
Ultimately a disappointment.  I can't use these!",1020988800,2,793,4.489510489510489
1251842,5,B00002AFWO,"I bought the box set about 3 months ago and I absolutely love it. It gives you a variety to choose from. I do the Fat burn every other day, and rotate the other vids on the other days. If you are consistant with your workout, and eat right, you will lose weight.  The only negative thing I have to say is that they don't stretch you out very well before the workouts. So just be sure to take a little extra time beforehand to limber up (especially the calves). Other than that, I love it!! Enjoy!",1018137600,5,496,4.11340206185567
1251843,5,B00002AFWO,I only own the fat burning video of this series. I just purcased the arm&abs and hips&buns videos but haven't recived them yet but i have to say the fat burning video is awsome. My heart rate was way up and i was deffinatly sweating. Also most important it was so fun!! Veena and Neena really know how to belly dance. This made me feel like a sexy belly dancer and i was burning calories too!! I cant wait to get more in there serise. Although it is not that long of a workout. After the warm up you only do about fifteen minutes of cardio. But thats ok i would just suggest doing it twice. I did it yesturaday and my muscles are still sore!!!,1016928000,3,643,4.111111111111111
1251844,5,B00002AFWO,"I love this video! I had never bellydanced before and was afraid to start because I am a 300 pound woman and every workout makes me feel inadiquate. With this video I lost 2 inches in less than a month and I always look foreward to my workout. It makes me feel sexy and beautiful agian. Veena and Neena take the time to show you every move clearly and slowly so you never miss a step, the music is charming and uplifting.  If this can work for me it can work for anyone. I loved it so much I got The Sensual Art of Belldance from them also.  Good luck and enjoy",1014163200,,561,4.0
1251845,5,B00002AFWO,"This series is very professionally done; some of the nicest instructional videos I've ever seen. The sound quality is excellent, no echoes, and the music is just the right volume. The ""Belly Twins"" show you terrific exercizes that are easy (relatively!) and low-impact. You get a great workout, and learn movements for dance all at the same time.
Please don't mistake this for a dance instruction video; it is not, although you are treated to delightful performances by the instructors. This is a workout series, which have movements that are either very much like dance movements, or ARE dance movements, practiced over and over, toning the muscles used in that motion. I highly recommend these!",1012780800,7,696,5.060869565217391
1251846,5,B00002AFWO,"I love these videos!  They are worth the money, fun to do, and well produced.  I hate aerobics, and was never motivated by other exercise videos but Neena and Veena's Bellydance progam is great.  If you struggle to find a fun fitness routine, and you like dancing (ya know, have some rhythm), then this Boxed-Set is for you!!
The videos were produced for ""fitness,"" and not necessarily  to ""learn"" belly dance moves.  However, I think these videos do a great job of providing both a workout routine and teaching some BASIC belly dance moves.  If you have taken belly dance classes previously, then you will have no problem following along.  If you haven't, you MAY be a little unclear about how to do some of the moves.  However, for the most part, they fully explain how to do the belly dance moves -- a great explanation was provided for shoulder shimmy.  The ""Basic Moves"" video in this set provides an overview of basic belly dance steps, and might be a good video to purchase first -- if you are unsure whether or not to buy the set.
The four videos target a different areas of the body for exercise and toning (e.g. arms, hips, butt, thigh).  You really get a great workout, and a refresher of belly dance moves.  At the end of each video, they do a beautiful dance performance --great for costuming ideas and for choreography.  I would recommend these videos for intermediate/new belly dancers looking for a refresher, and for someone looking for an alternative fitness routine.",1008460800,17,1485,4.6692307692307695
1251847,5,B00002AFWO,"I found it troubling that someone found these videos to be ""porn-like."" These videos have never made me feel more feminine. The music is soft and unobtrusive with a VERY Middle Eastern sound. I find myself practicing in the bathroom mirror daily and admiring muscles I didn't even know I had. My husband commented that ""those videos have really helped."" I can't sing the twin's praises enough! These tapes were meant for people who want something more cardio than yoga, but with the same sensuality. Granted there isn't much bellydancing, but your motivation and strengh levels more than make up for that.",1004400000,4,605,4.9411764705882355
1251848,5,B00002AFWO,I have been dancing for 15 years and I have to admit that the fat burning tape had me panting. I even had to stop it once the first time.

1251849,5,B00002AFWO,"This video did very well in instructing, demonstrating, and motivating.  The routines are easy to follow, and yet get your blood pumping.  As I do the routines over and over, I always find a new and easier way to execute the movements to maximize my workout.  A very good supplement to the bellydance class I am taking, and gives my workout routine a varied flavor.  I look forward to reviewing their Sensual Art of Bellydance series.

1251860,5,B00002AFWO,"I absolutely loved this set. I have been intrigued by belly dancing for quite some time. I've always had a hard time finding something exercise related that could hold my interest. I tried Tae-Bo but after a while I became bored with it. So I decided to purchase this. I started doing the basics first. I had so much fun that I did 3 more times the same day. The basics carry you through common body movements that are used for belly dancing such as hip drops. A few days later I went on to the fat burning. This is a lot of fun as well, you do a lot more hopping and jumping around, this tape is basically an aerobic workout. Then I did the arms & abs tape. This one will have your arms one fire when you're done! The moves are so simple, yet effective, your arms are fighting gravity with a lot of the movements and when you wake up the next day, boy does it show because your arms will be sore. However, this workout is not boring because when you're using your arms you're always !doing a movement with your abs. Finally I did the hips, buns and thighs video. This tape is awesome. You learn how to do a lot of hip movements and move your body at the same time like you see actual belly dancers. It's tricky but after practice you'll get it down. Everyday I do 2 tapes the fat burning tape and then I alternate each day with either the arms&abs or the hips, buns and thighs tape. Might I also add that the girls always do an ending and opening dance sequence on each tape. Which I enjoy to watch, my favorite dance sequence is on the hips and buns and thighs tape! I love these tapes and I now plan to purchase the other boxed set, ""Sensual Art of Bellydance.""",992044800,11,1664,4.154798761609907

I felt like I was doing a workout video- not belly dancing.  For most of the videos, it's the same movements done over and over.  I really didn't like having two instructors- it made it confusing and they don't have a lot of personality.  The best part of the video is the routine that's shown at the end.  Don't buy this- you'll be disappointed!",990748800,3,514,4.257731958762887

I felt like I could get this workout from Kathy Smith, but at least she's personable and friendly.  The video is done with a voice-over that makes it cheap sounding and not really like they are instructing. There was one move that you do when your hand is on your forehead for 5 minutes!

I've lost about 10 lbs. and still losing, I've slimmed down, and generally feel worlds better.
This is a great starter for beginners who want to learn the basics of belly dancing, although these moves that are performed here are not strung together in dance form.

I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get in shape and learn the basic moves of belly dance.",986515200,3,436,4.154761904761905
1251866,5,B00002AFWO,"Let's face it, exercise can be boring (especially alone.) If you are planning to exercise with only the company of your video player and closed curtains, it might as well be fun.
Neena and Veena are identical twin dancers, which makes for a visual experience that is unparalleled in exercise videos. The sets are appropriate but not distracting and the twins wear leotards plus a hip-isolating scarf that accentuates the important hip movements. The voice-over is clear and easy to hear, the music is Middle-Eastern style but soft enough not to detract from the instructor.
There are four videos in the set: the Fat Burning routine mainly uses the legs and is kind of low-impact aerobic. Basic Moves teaches body isolations which is the most important building block of belly dance itself. This video is useful for learning the basics of belly dance itself. Arms and Abs focuses on the arm isolations (snakes, undulating arms, hands) that are essential to dance but also work the upper body and stomach, when you drop to the floor and do mat work (have an exercise mat handy.)  Hips, Buns, and Thighs: uses leg lifts and lunges, hip circles and hip drops. Arms are added to make it more dance-like.
If you want a dance routine to watch, stay til the end of the vidoe for your reward (there is a solo.) If you want a basic dance routine to do yourself, Neena and Veena have produced a separate video called The Sensual Art of Belly Dance: Basic Dance. It has step-by-step instructions for body isolations leading to a short routine. It makes a great overall warm-up and mild workout and is also a good introduction to belly dance.",985305600,37,1629,4.71578947368421
1251867,5,B00002AFWO,"Bellydance Fitness for Beginners. Its a great workout that'll make you sweat, but not feel dead or exhausted. These are the first bellydance tapes I have bought and are great for the beginner. They take basic moves and break them down so you can do them easily. You probably won't get them down with the first try, but you'll be surprised at how quickly you will. These tapes are also great for building, shaping and toning muscle. When your done, you can feel all your muscles tight and burning. Its great! The music is great, Neena and Veena's attitudes are great and the soothing instuctional voice is great. BUT, its NOT a bellydancing tape, I was a little dissapointed with that, but I'm still happy with it.
Another thing; it may just be me, but I get mad when people show off or do things without explaining them. N and V kind of did that. At the end of each tape is 1 or 2 dances. They're great and everything, they have all out costumes and the moves are so cool, BUT THEY DON'T SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT! There is nothing on choreography. There is very little on actual dance moves. And you'd think they take the few moves you learn in the video and incorporate them in the dance but they don't. It was just a big tease. The beginning sequence is a lot like that too.

Neena and Veena are both beautiful, and amazing dancers, and when you're doing the moves along with them you feel beautiful and sensual too. Don't worry about not getting the moves right away, one time when you least expect it, you'll all of a sudden be doing it like you did all your life. I just got these tapes a few days ago, and already I am seeing a difference in the way I look and feel. Neena and Veena are friendly and they take you through the steps easily. The fat burning tape really makes you sweat, but your body doesn't think it's too hard. These tapes aren't like any other exercise tapes : you actually have fun doing them and look forward to your next workout.",979862400,10,726,4.268115942028985
1251869,4,B00002AFWO,"As an advanced dancer, I was less than intrigued when the hype started on this video set... but then, I was lent one of the tapes. I IMMEDIATELY went out and bought the whole set! These tapes are a beautiful, gentle, low-impact workout and are valuable for every dancer, beginning and advanced alike. The twins have put together an excellent fitness routine that is both meditative and sweat-inducing. It is the first of its kind and I want MORE! The people who were disapointed with the video series were expecting something other than what was advertised. This is a WORK OUT series for bellydancers or those who wish to become bellydancers, not instructional how-to tapes. It is intended to prepare and tone your muscles for the art of middle eastern dance. The video taping is excellent and professional. Veena and Neena do performances at the end of each tape, and they are superb dancers. I can't wait until they release more videos!",971049600,29,938,4.796296296296297

7915524,3,B00002AFWO,"REVIEW OF ""BASIC MOVES"" PORTION...

This is a half hour dance *instruction* video.  Some moves may tire out your shoulders and hips, but it isn't much of a ""workout,"" and definitely not cardio or strenuous.

~10min of head/neck & shoulder/arm movements .

~10min of rib/hip movements.  ~5min of basic steps.

~5min of floor moves (Cleopatra/outer thigh lift, cat, leg stretch)

They introduce individual isolated moves, and repeat them several times for users to practice; most moves were easy to pick up (but will take time & practice to make it look graceful).  I don't know if it's the instructors or if it's because they are demonstrated isolated motions, but they look a bit robotic/jerky.  This seems is an  Intro to belly dance for total beginners.

I think people with previous belly dance experience will find this basic video too slow/boring and stiff.

==============================

This review refers to the ""HIPS BUNS THIGH"" portion.  As the title promises, this video focuses specifically on working butt and legs for beginners.

Overall the workout isn't strenuous, except I found the hip drops & hip lifts section really worked my butt tough in a way that non-bellydance workouts haven't targeted.

The 25min workout includes the following: leg stretchs, inner thigh lifts, outer thigh lifts, knee bends (like mini-lunges), butt squeezes (I wish they explained these a little more), lots of hip circles, hip drop & hip lifts (these definitely were tiring), walk on balls of feet, thigh stretch (unless you're agile & have strong abs, skip this cause it's easy to hurt your back and knees), cat stretch.

I like how the instructors wore simple outfits that weren't distracting.

This video is for people new to belly dancing who want to learn individual moves and practice their strength & coordination in doing those moves.  But don't except a super-tough workout or a dance routine.

I would much rather RECOMMEND ""BELLYDANCE BASICS AND BEYOND: Technique for a Solid Foundation"" BY JENNA, which is a 2.5hr DVD with much better technique and practice options; it provides a teaching portion of all the major belly dance moves, as well as a drill/practice section.",1173744000,,2181,5.090140845070422
7915525,4,B00002AFWO,"I started taking ballet when I was three and continued to study ballet along with some jazz and tap classes through college.  I did bellydance and folkdance while in highschool.  These tapes made me want to dance again.  When I graduated I was depressed and busy working full time and taking extra course work that I needed for grad school. I felt very isolated because I don't live in an area with a lot of young single friend I had also moved away from the school where I graduated.  I needed a cheap and quick way to work out and I didn't have money for new shoes or equipment.

I saw the twins on a TV news magizine show, they were so nice and fun and I liked their dancing so I decided to by their tapes. I bought them fun and I became addicted to belly dance.  My favorite tapes are the arms and abs and the hips and buns.  THey are a bit more challenging in the toning department then the basic moves.  I like to use the basic moves to warm up for dancing.  The fat burning is the reason I gave the tapes four stars.  It definatly does the job of getting me huffing and puffing but the moves should have alternated with other moves so that you do not overwork your calves. I was so thrilled I did all four on the first day and the next day I was so sore",1131580800,6,1260,4.064777327935222

7915527,4,B00002AFWO,"I lead a group of women who are learning belly dance through videos and here are what we have said about this set...

Basic moves:

Great for stretching and learning the very basics.  Wonderful starter video.

Arms and Abs:

A definite workout for the abs and arms.  We are very glad that it is only a 30 min video!

Buns and thighs:

Great video for working out those glutes.  I know that mine are getting solid.

Fat Burning:

Very intense!  You may need to work up to this one.",1117324800,7,480,4.269662921348314
7915528,4,B00002AFWO,Great exercise tapes for someone who doesn't like to exercise and loves to belly dance. Tones important muscles used in dance. These are not belly dancing but you do refine some movements. More like drills. And learn some hand techniques. They are fun and fast. The fat burner one was too much bouncing for me. I need aerobic without impact. 30 minute of pleasure. I like to use these and have all their tapes.,1104969600,6,410,4.554054054054054

They give you the best and safest workout and some good basics for belly dance.  I'm actually losing weight using the Arms & Abs tape using the Slim Down tape at the end.  Great way to spend an one and half hours.",1080086400,6,338,4.1692307692307695
7915530,5,B00002AFWO,"Great if you don't like the regular exercise stuff. Will work those hips and thighs. Be great if you just had a baby. Get those places back. Most women have trouble with their hips and thighs.
Music is great. I'm a beginner dancer myself. Only do it for home and pleasure.
Their dance at the end of the videos are wonderful. I could watch them all day.",1073088000,5,352,4.268656716417911

7915532,5,B00002AFWO,"Neena and Veena bellydancing videos are incredible.  Not only does this series help you get into shape, but shows you the beautiful art of bellydance and makes you eager to learn more.  The fat burning video in this series is to me,  the best cardio video out there.  While you are doing the video, you may think, well gee I am just hopping up and down or twisting, but you really work up a sweat in no time.  Even now, after I do the video (and I try to do it at least 3-4 times a week), I am really sweaty, feeling energized and never tired.  It can be challenging at first, but if you start with the beginner's video of the series first and do that a few times before you start the others, it will come much easier.  These videos also incorporate lots of stretching and beginning yoga moves as well.  I have seen a dramatic change in my flexability and strength since doing Neena and Veena's workouts.  The music can be a little montomous after a while, but the voice over instructor and the warmness the twins portray onscreen gives you some reassurance and confidence while doing the videos.  I think the best part of all these videos also is you never feel like you are straight ""working out"", but expressing yourself through the feminine and beautiful art of bellydancing.  I am saving up my money so I can by the next boxed set of Mystic Dance and the other two.  I can't wait!  Thanks Neena and Veena! :)",1055462400,3,1413,4.347328244274809
