8395415,4,B003E7EKEI,"It is an easy, good stretch program. I like floor or ball routines to wake up in the morning. I also like short workouts in the morning- 20-30 minutes is perfect... this one is 29 minutes long. I add hip circles on the ball and spinal flexes on the ball before starting, but otherwise, it is a good little workout. The quality of the video itself could be better, but the workout itself is sound for beginners or for someone like me who likes something gentle to wake them up in the morning ( I consider myself very fit so this isn't a calorie-burn workout or anything- I do that in the afternoon). So for beginners or the very fit, this can be added to your week.",1421193600,,664,4.2362204724409445
8395416,4,B003E7EKEI,"Pros
It's actually really good, not too long either. Having the ball when you do your yoga is great for those who haven't yet mastered their balance with very beginners yoga.
Cons
There isn't more like it.
It's a little too basic and easy.",1411084800,,239,4.454545454545454
8395417,4,B003E7EKEI,"Great video if you are new to yoga or working with the stability ball.  I was looking for new material, hence four stars.",1353024000,,121,4.260869565217392
8395418,4,B003E7EKEI,"I am not a fan of yoga but have been in a couple of car accidents which have created chronic neck and back pain.  My massage therapist has been encouraging me to do yoga to help.  I do like exercise balls so I thought this video would be a nice compromise and it was!!!!  When I have tried other yoga videos (not by this instructor) I have been intimidated because I do not have the flexibility of these pretzel people out there.  This video presented exercises I could do.  As a bonus, I felt stretched out and got some upper back cracks without feeling strained.  The instructor's voice was very calming instead of annoying like some others I've heard. I will definitely incorporate this into my regular exercise schedule.",1271030400,,724,4.573643410852713
