8450619,5,B00501LNPA,"I love Jari Love's exercise DVDs.  She makes it so easy to follow along with her exercises and makes it fun too.  I really saw the changes happen and noticed my lifting ability increase drastically.  Great exercise dvd for those who do not like going to the gym or who can't afford going to the gym.  Especially helpful for those of us who are pushing 50 or older.  Jari keeps an easy pace yet you get results.  If you enjoy a good exercise program, this is the dvd for you.  Get working out and have fun with it and more importantly enjoy the changes that will happen.",1365724800,,569,4.261682242990654
