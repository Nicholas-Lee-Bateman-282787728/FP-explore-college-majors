8273920,5,B0019FM5YE,"I watched both DVDs from David Keil over the weekend.  The subject, anatomy, is dry unless you are into it, but David finds a way to make it meaningful from the perspective of a yoga practitioner and or aspiring or current teacher. He covers a huge amount of territory.

I thought, looking at the cover, that it would have humor in it, but in reality the DVD is very serious and other than the occasional and rare joke (yes looks like the skeleton has his skull empty), it is a very focused and a valuable resource for practitioners that want to know more about what goes on inside the body.

David points out that there is a lot of elements in anatomy, but, just like in yoga, it is important to gather them all together, they are not separate systems, they are all very interrelated, and throughout the lecture you get the sense of how each part connects with the other.

I found the first DVD in the series valuable in the way of learning the basic terminology, i.e.: ""distal and proximal"" ""lateral vs. medial"" ""rotation"" etc.  The explanation is clear. As well as some formulas he makes to remember some names (bone name + letter ""O"" + Joint name).

I do not pretend that I have learned and I am now versed on all terms and nuances. Anatomy is a profound subject, but I feel I have a go to place, and I will probably watch it again, and again, when necessary.

DVD II opens with the psoas, which is the ""center of gravity that controls our center of movement, and that is why it gets to be included in what is known as ""core"" (psoas, abdominal muscles etc)"".

A large chapter talks about back pain and addresses disks herniation, then gives ideas on how to treat back pain on which he separates two specific lines of thoughts, those who think that to treat it:
a) The abdominal muscles have to be strengthened, and
b) those who think that the abdominal muscles need to be released.

He believes that the releasing of the abdominal muscles may help those who sit for most of the day as the tissues will tend to shorten due to posture and the ribs and pubic bone become closer together (hunching, -my word-). Overall, of course he points you need to look at each individual,ala Krishnamacharya, to see what is happening in their organism before making any recommendations. It is a great talk.

He then talks, among a few other chapters, about the diaphragm and has an exposition on similarities between the lower and upper body.
I would say it is interesting to see anatomy in this form, meaning conversation rather than book, although I wish there were more drawings and animations, never the less as it stands the video is a pretty good resource to have around.",1313452800,7,2665,4.49896480331263
8273921,5,B0019FM5YE,"This is a great yoga anatomy DVD. I've been a yoga teacher for 10 years and this is the best yoga anatomy DVD yet (including the books that can be very complicated and boring).  I never wrote a review, but this is like sharing good with others. David Keil is a natural at the camera, at being so simple at boring difficult subjects.  I actually went to his web site to find out more...he only has two DVDs but I will be willing to buy any other that he might do.
great buy.",1286496000,,473,4.075268817204301
8273922,5,B0019FM5YE,As a Yoga Teacher I find this series invaluable.  This should definitely be part of all teacher trainings. The explanation of how the body is put together is amazingly informative and easily understood.,1246752000,,202,5.121212121212121
8273923,5,B0019FM5YE,"YogAnatomy dvd sheds light on an otherwise dense subject. David, who on camera is as lively and down-to-earth as he is in person, demystifies the specialized vocabulary of anatomy. With simpler words and straight-forward concepts, David virtually dissects various parts of the human body for us and, best of all, relates their functions to yoga poses most practitioners recognize. The models and graphics in the dvd only enhance David's clear and informative style. This dvd will be infinitely useful to yoga practitioners and teachers alike.",1221609600,,542,5.3882352941176475
8273924,5,B0019FM5YE,"Watching David Keil's Yoganatomy Volume 1 feels like attending an anatomy workshop in your own home!  David's on-camera presence is natural and engaging.  The information he shares with his viewers is not only rich, but down-to-earth and accessible.  The way he makes connections between the various systems and structures of our bodies makes anatomy easy to understand and directly applicable to all that we learn and experience on our yoga mats.  This DVD is perfect for any student or teacher of yoga who desires a deeper, clearer understanding of how the human body moves and is structured.  I can't wait for Volume 2!

Mr. Keil's passion for both anatomy and for the practice of yoga are obvious in this dvd.  At last, a refreshing departure from the sleep-inducing, marginally relevant fare often seen in this genre.

The best video of its kind that I have seen.",1215043200,6,468,5.012987012987013

I have read through a lot of boring anatomy books and seen a fes dvds.  This one really gives me valuable information.  It changed the way i look at my yoga practice, because I can better understand how my body works. The chapter on connective tissue is amazing. I am a better teacher and a more informed yoga practitioner becasue of it. I highly recommend it!",1212710400,7,468,4.35632183908046
