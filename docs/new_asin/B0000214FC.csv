7915155,5,B0000214FC,"This film has become one of my favorites of all time!  The action in this movie is virutally non-stop and Delta team characters are fun to root for.  The Director Mark Roper does an awesome job with a low budget; his battle scenes are more intense and exciting than any Bruce Willis type movie.  The soundtrack was also well done as it helped bring more drama to the heroic scenes.  The shots of the Statue of Liberty at the end were cool.  Overall, if you like patriotic action movies where the good guys kill all the bad guys, then you should buy Operation Delta Force III - Clear Target.  Easily the best of the whole series.",1059177600,4,628,4.370689655172414
