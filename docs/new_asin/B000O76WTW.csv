2791222,5,B000O76WTW,"I am a believer of this simply because it makes sense.  I have seen Abraham in person, have subscribed to their CDs, have many of their DVDs, and am taking their Alaskan Well-being cruise in July!  This video is another way to present the one answer they have to everything.  If you have not heard anything from Abraham, and you are reading this reveiw - just maybe it is time to listen to their answer to the joy of living and life.",1178236800,12,433,4.2560975609756095
2791223,5,B000O76WTW,"As interesting as the other one but less confusing. The explanations are welcomed. Another doc caught my eye recently. It's not so much about tricks and advice but it definitely illustrates the real life application of ""The Secret"". I'm talking about the documentary ""Sanctuary Lisa Gerrard"" from Dead Can Dance. Even though, Lisa may not know it, she applies the secret! It's a great complement to this DVD.",1177632000,5,408,5.014705882352941
2791224,5,B000O76WTW,"I'm glad that I watched The Secret so that I became aware of the Law of Attraction and so that I would be moved to study it further. I've read several books by Esther, Jerry and Abraham, but it was so much more powerful to watch them! This movie explains it all and gives you such great tools to transform you life. It's a must watch!",1177459200,18,334,4.075757575757576
2791225,5,B000O76WTW,"For the uninitiated, these DVDs (we're talkin' three hours of footage on two DVDs!) are the perfect introduction to the family of teachers known as ""Abraham."" Incidentally, they chose the name ""Abraham"" because their message is at the heart of all religions. Esther Hicks has been receiving Abraham's message and unconsciously translating their ""blocks of thought"" for over 20 years. Esther and Abraham are the foremost teachers of the Law of Attraction (you know, that universal law that you've heard so much about in the past year because of the popularity of ""The Secret."") The footage on these DVDs was actually filmed in 2004 by a brilliant fledgling filmmaker named Peter Beamish. I had the good fortune to meet Peter and his lovely wife on a cruise that I took with the Abraham-Hicks clan. They also pre-viewed the DVD for those of us who were on the cruise, and it literally sent chills up my spine. There is a knowing, a feeling of resonance, and a Truth with a capital ""T"" to the words that Esther so expertly speaks for Abraham.

This DVD will take you through the early days of Esther and her husband Jerry's discovery of the phenomenon known to most as ""channeling."" (They don't use the word ""channeling"" to refer to what Esther does, since she is an integral part of the process...and not just setting aside her consciousness as she speaks for Abraham...but rather, she becomes more of who she really is and therefore is able to tap into infinite intelligence.) The DVD explores the questions that most people would ask if they had the chance, and it is set to beautiful music, imagery, and word-play in between interview segments. It is a masterful piece of filmmaking, and if you are in vibrational alignment with it, it will certainly take your level of understanding to even greater heights. Run, don't walk, to your keyboard and mouse to buy this DVD!!! It is truly life-changing and inspiriational. Did I mention that I like it? :)

2791226,5,B000O76WTW,"I have read several of Abrahams works over the last few years, but it was through watching this DVD, ""The Secret Behind 'The Secret'"", that I was really able to pull it all together.  I now feel like I truly understand The Law of Attraction - and the need to not only think positively, but to use your emotions as a barometer to increase your vibrational level to match that which you are wanting - as this is the only way for you to allow all the goodness you desire to enter your life experience.

It's amazing to watch the difference in Esther's speaking when Abraham is present - her word usage, cadence, & sound changes.  And, although I felt strongly connected with Esther from the beginning, I felt a wonderful energy change when Abraham entered - it was truly amazing!

This DVD is a ""must have"" for anyone interested in changing their lives for the better - especially those who are open to the ideas of manifesting, co-creating, and The Law of Attraction - as this DVD provides a thorough teaching of all of these concepts.  This is truly an awesome gift to the world!",1177113600,84,1078,4.479591836734694
2791227,5,B000O76WTW,"This DVD appeals to two audiences:  fans of ""The Secret"" and fans of Abraham-Hicks.

First group:  If you've read the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret/dp/1582701709/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret</a>&nbsp;or viewed the DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-Extended-Edition/dp/B000K8LV1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret (Extended Edition)</a>, or better yet, viewed the original DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-Original-Edition/dp/B000K3I7SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret (Original Edition)</a>&nbsp;that included Abraham/Esther Hicks in it, and you'd like an even clearer, more comprehensive explanation of the Law of Attraction and how and why our emotions or feelings create our reality, then this DVD is for you.  The teachings called Law of Attraction are a spiritual teaching of a universal, spiritual law, and who better to teach it that the group of spiritual beings who call themselves Abraham or Source Energy.

Second group:  If you've heard Abraham lecture on CD, on DVD, or in person, and one of your favorites in Abraham's talks has always been when Abraham tells a story about the intimate details of the lovely, very human lives of husband and wife Jerry and Esther Hicks, then this DVD is a must have for you, as Jerry and Esther themselves tell stories in this DVD about their life together, and detail, in a depth not available on any previous Abraham-Hicks Publications book, CD or DVD, their lives pre-Abraham and the step-by-step path that led them to Abraham.  This DVD is in effect the most complete history of Jerry and Esther's evolution pre- and post-Abraham.

As for the DVD itself, it's very professionally produced, and the music and graphics used created the effect of this DVD being a much more calming and emotionally moving experience than ""The Secret"" DVD, I thought.  This DVD had more clarity and focus whereas ""The Secret"" DVD was more MTV-like in its jumping back and forth from one teacher to another.

There are three episodes of about 45 to 50 minutes each.  The first episode is the show host's interview with Jerry and Esther Hicks, who is the channel through which Abraham communicates.  The second and third episodes contain the host's question and answer sessions with the entity Abraham himself.  The interviewer's piercing questions are beautifully and lovingly answered by Abraham and this Q & A actually contains the most moving parts of this film.  For example, when the host pressed on for proof of Abraham's existence or reality, Abraham responded by saying that ""we are not so much interested in that you believe in our existence, as we are interested in that you come to adore your own.""  There is such unconditional love in these teachings, that one can't help but feel that this is what it's like to hear God speak.

Personally, I've found no clearer answers to life's big questions than those answers from this teacher called Abraham, and, not too long after I've immersed myself in Abraham's teachings, I sold all my other spiritual, self-improvement books to the used book section of the local metaphysical bookstore here.  Reading other authors now feels like listening to a radio station whose signal is not always clear.  Why guess at what an author means, why read between the lines, when there is a teacher as clear as Abraham who tells it the way the Universe really is, the way it's all really set up to run?",1176681600,252,4666,6.2398753894081
2791228,5,B000O76WTW,"If you are reading this, it's clear, you are about to take your awareness to a new high.  Remarkable!  You may never again see as intimate and enjoyable an encounter with Esther and Jerry AND Abraham as in this setting. This is far and away the most chilling, joyful set of DVDs around.  Insights for having life work have always been around but now the insights have become so easy to put into practice.  You can never get the ""how do I do it"" questions answered?  Well wait till you see this.  See the source behind The Secret.",1176681600,18,529,4.346938775510204
2791229,5,B000O76WTW,"For those ready to hear the collective consciousness named ""Abraham"", of the Non-Physical Realm, speak their perfect wisdom through the physical vortex of Esther Hicks, this DVD is a masterpiece. Abraham has been around since the beginning of mankind and has said that there has never been so seamless and clear a translator of this vibration as is that of Esther Hicks.  There has never been as asker close to that of Jerry Hicks who actually summoned the vibration through the vortex of Esther. No two people could be more lovingly devoted to bringing this message to us than these two incredible people.  They are the living example of what they teach.  I have been learning and living this knowing for over ten years and it continues to become more.  This ""knowing"" works for me.  It is ineffable (no words to describe) using Jerry's perfect word to describe Abraham. What makes someone believable to someone is different for each of us and we each decide.

Everyone hears Abraham differently, and everyone will continue to hear what Abraham speaks or writes differently each time they hear it. That is the beauty of the individual evolving perception within each of us.  Abraham teaches us the tools to use the Law of Attraction, and does this through reminding us what we have forgotten--not a secret--but our connection to our ""Source/Non-Physical/All That Is/God Force"" stream--the label does not matter.  They teach us about vibration and our emotional guidance system through humor, example, clarity, and love.  Peter Beamish does a magnificent job of asking questions of Jerry and Esther Hicks--and Abraham--that will take you to a place of knowing that says ""I've come back home""....this is truly the ultimate creation in our age of enlightenment.

2791230,5,B000O76WTW,"I am a huge fan of this life-transforming clarity and expected that this would mostly be a repeat of previous offerings, but there was lots of new information.  It was made by Peter Beamish (and Annette Repstock) of Aura Productions (aura.ca) - Peter is the interviewer.  Oh it was put together SO well and so fun and so good.  There is wonderful music and beautiful water sparkles and graphic quote-words-flowing that are really thought provoking.  There is a really funny clip in the front I had forgotten about from Oh God, with George Burns and John Denver that is a hilarious surprise and yet more appropriate now then ever!  Esther and Jerry are better than they've ever been and it's so nice learning more about them.  Jerry tells lots of amazing stuff I had never heard before.  Esther is so funny and charming.  And of course Abraham is there too.. with their crystal clarity and vitality ever-flowing.  It is a great introduction DVD to people just meeting Law of Attraction and Self Empowering Ways to Guide Thought and Meet Your Inner Source Self, as well as for old practicers of the Art of Allowing because new ideas pop in while watching.  It's a definite thought re-stimulator and it feels good through-out.  There is a part in it of audience responses (funny, interesting) to the initial private 2005 showing of this Abraham material.  It is wonderful to re-remember the initial excited buzz of new possibilities when awareness of who we really just becomes freshly realized (or re-realized).  The last 5 minute preview is of a new television series by Peter: In Other Words.  Boy was that a teaser!  I wanted more.  I'm still going around and around with that girl in that playground (of my mind) in joy.  I'm so glad I ordered this DVD set.  I highly recommend it.  Thank you to all involved in the creation of this vibration station of elation.  (I could go on and on more, but I will stop now)",1176422400,26,1914,4.656716417910448

2791251,5,B000O76WTW,"I find all books and videos with/by Ester Hicks and Abraham absolutely fascinating. Abraham, a collective consciousness, channeled by Esther, is a well of treasure and knowledge. Her late husband, Jerry, is in this video. I remember when he passed away, non-believers were wondering how come he died, couldn't Abraham help him to survive, and what will Esther do now. I was just shaking my head, thinking that as long as we live in physical bodies which decay, at some point we all, everyone of us, must pass away. And I was sure their arrangement/life/destiny agreement was that he will pass first so she will feel his presence even though his physical body was gone, and see that it is all true! And that's exactly what happened. Esther and the team helping her with scheduling performances and traveling with her goes on and Jerry is with them all, she can feel his presence just like she feels the presence of Abraham. The Abraham teachings are true, we are all souls having a physical experience, and it is possible, for gifted individuals like Esther, to channel higher consciousness beings. There are many short videos on youtube for those not sure if they should buy this video or any other video or book with/by Esther, to get convinced this whole work is a real treasure. I have several books and videos, but I think it is in this one she tells the story about how it all started, a fascinating story! Both she and Jerry are very sympathetic people, a true joy to watch and to listen to. Now that I think about it, it makes me sad to know that he is gone, that she is the only one able to talk to him anymore. He was the one who introduced her to spirituality. What a sweet and intelligent man! I am sure that Esther and Jerry, and Abraham, all changed the lives of many many people around the world.

It was obvious that something had gone wrong in the order process...it really was a nightmare. I was double billed and refused delivery on the duplicate,  brought in AMX dispute...I had to cancel all my credit cards connected with Amazaon, because they also charged my debit card they had on file, which they were not authorized to use for that transaction...we shall see who the ethical one will be!",1278288000,,747,4.616541353383458

Mr. Hicks is a psychological enigma; as he speaks he is reluctant to maintain any amount of eye contact with the interviewer, his conversation frequently wanders and he ends up telling some pointless story that has no relevance to the question he was asked, his mode of speaking is incoherent and meandering plus his voice is grating and quite tedious to listen to.",1263081600,2,612,4.5636363636363635

Then one day a friend of mine said if I like ""The Secret"" then I should consider watching ""Abraham"" with an open mind. He also mentioned that not all people would be in a position to be receptive to this kind of information.

The curiosity got the better of me and watch it right away. Today I have to say that it goes far beyond the concept taught in ""The Secret"". The interview was amazing. The questions were great, but the answers were even better.

Some people are taken aback with the concept, but then I tell them to focus on the responses. Forget about the whole channeling thing. I only recommend Abraham to those people that liked ""The Secret"".

So if you liked ""The Secret"", get in for a real roller coaster ride with ""Abraham"". I strongly recommend it. And if you like ""Abraham"", I strongly recommend that you all their titles. Click link below.

2791309,5,B000O76WTW,"I have been studying the work of Abraham since 2006 (where WAS I for the last 60 years???!!); it has absolutely changed my life.  I had read many of the Seth books in the 1980s but did not make the connection with how to embody his teachings.  NOW I can understand, NOW the Seth material has become a library of information:  BUT Abraham's teachings, the books, the tapes/cds of the seminars all across the country year after year--everything Abraham says has led me to a deeper understanding of how the universe operates, and thus I am now finding out who I really am.  I am a life-long seeker; I have studied with Joseph Campbell; I am a child of the 60s (born in 1946).  Abraham has opened my own universe to me.

If you are drawn to this subject matter, I recommend any and all of the Abraham books, but start with  ""A New Beginning I and II"" by Jerry and Esther Hicks--and by all means watch this video ""The Secret Behind The Secret"" and then feel yourself flowing into who you are, who you REALLY are, and who you want yourself to become.  It won't happen over night, but it is the beginning of another chapter down the road less taken for most of humanity, and the one we all would benefit from taking.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Getting-Into-The-Vortex-Guided-Meditations-CD-and-User-Guide/dp/1401931693/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Getting Into The Vortex: Guided Meditations CD and User Guide</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Introducing-Abraham-The-Secret-Behind-The-Secret/dp/B000O76WTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Introducing Abraham - The Secret Behind ""The Secret""</a>",1221350400,7,1668,5.724696356275303
2791310,4,B000O76WTW,"Ok so about 6 years ago a business associate told me about ""Abraham"" - She mentioned how she had been following Esther Hicks for years and years  and that Esther was someone who ""channeled"" a group of spirits called Abraham... I remember thinking.. ""oh my this woman who I so admire is off her rocker"" I politely tilted my head and said "" oh really  -interesting"" thinking internally the entire time ""what planet did my friend hail from?""

It was never brought up again until 5 years later the same  friend bought me both the DVD and the book ""the Secret"" and it changed my entire outlook on life.  In the original video ( Esther has been edited out of the new versions) I was drawn to what she had to say and how she said it.  She was someone that I felt a bond with and found myself a bit mermerized while I listened to her.  It was becasue of the secert that I turned to  her other material including this DVD.

She truly was the secret behind the secret and if you listen to her early works you will know that.  This dvd is well done although I must say the very long  ocean rippling intros are a bit too much.  They start out OK and go to painfully unbearable fast.  But the material here is right on target and well worth watching.. it gives you the background on Esther - her husband Jerry and of course ""Abraham"".  When you listen to Abraham's teaching as they are told through Esther you truly realize this information is coming from a being far superior to anyone in this world and there are wonderful lessons to be learned.  If you find this DVD enlightening you have only scratched the surface and the ""Abraham-Hicks"" website will allow you to sign up for monthly CD's which are also great...

All in all I was once a total skeptic and now a true believer,  Finally teachings about who we are and why that makes total sense...I mentally thank my friend every day for the path she knudged me on, and I am forever changed..

oh also another mind blowing work is ""Many Lives, Many Masters"" by Brian Weiss - written over 20 years ago it amazing parallels with Abraham's teachings...

So perhaps NOW you think I am from another planet and the ony thing that I can say is that it is not yet your time and there will come a time when this falls into place and you will come to the realization that everything is truly not what it seems...",1221350400,5,2343,4.308219178082192

The interview is great stuff but I absolutely cannot stand the incessant background film music.  The music seems so important to the director (and it IS film music, stolen from other well-known films), that it is credited BEFORE each section.  It rises and falls, swells and eddies but of course it cannot do so in response to Jerry and Esther's words because it was composed for something else.  It is a manufactured. pre-fabricated add-on to try to manipulate our emotions and we deserve better.

2791348,1,B000O76WTW,"I waited for the DVD in great anticipation only to be totally disappointed by its content. The `secret' in the DVD is that thought/brainwaves adjust the fabric of and/or events in the Universe, through a so called `Law of Attraction', to materialise more of what we want or trying to avoid because, according to a spirit called 'Abraham', the universe cannot distinguish between a positive and a negative thought. `Abraham' however provides no evidence for the existence of this `Law' of Attraction or how it has been tested and proved; indeed evidence, if any exists elsewhere, is anecdotal, selective and any reports of proof are subjective and are probably misrepresented. This observation will appear as an unpalatable truth to those already converted or to those who are being swept along by the current herd mentality but it would be unwise to hide your head in sand and not face the facts. Quantum Physics certainly does not provide any basis for this `Law of Attraction', contrary to popular belief; indeed there is no scientific basis for the existence of such a law.

I found Esther who acted as the medium, faking a ""connection"" with 'Abraham' (name probably historically derived from Brahma, the creator god in the Hindu Holy Trinity), from across the ether to a spiritual realm. In the DVD I found Jerry, her husband, the only, although still only partly credible, partner in this faking couple. Esther Hicks was not only insincere but quite obviously not in trance and fully conscious/awake through out this alleged 'interview' with 'Abraham'. She is very sharp and this may be why she has fooled her audience so long. Many of the views expressed were demonic; I particularly disliked Esther's AKA 'Abrahams' assertion that animals are very happy/willing parties who look forward to be killed and eaten over and over so that their spirits can be reborn time and again into this physical earth plane; this is insulting to ones intelligence- surprisingly this does not apply to us humans- thus on this basis she justifies factory farming (imprisonment followed by murder sanctioned to satisfy a human lust for consuming flesh) imposed on non-humans (animals) but not us! Surely we are simply a slightly more evolved species of monkey as DNA analysis completely proves. Nor may we be as intelligent as we would like to believe as was proved in very recent memory experiments where University students scored much lower than Chimps. I wonder what Charles Darwin would have said? Reading between the lines of the 'interview' it seems that at least the personal improvement coach Deepak Chopra, does not subscribe to these absurd Hicks's views; three cheers for him for refusing to join this bandwagon of quacks/ new age gurus and seeing the obvious flaws in the so called law! Readers wishing further enlightenment are urged to study a recent book by Kevin Hogan and Dave Lakhani et al entitled `The secret behind the secret law of attraction' which nicely exposes the real TRUTH about this so called `Law' in greater detail. While I applaud positive thinking coupled with persistence as probably the highest principle that leads to successful accomplishment of human desire, the concept of the 'Law of Attraction' is no more than clever marketing of hopefulness to the frustrated masses facing the actual cruel reality of life.

Simply put, logic states that if the Universe was succumbing to personal whim, as required by the `Law of Attraction', there would be utter chaos out there and not the order your senses actually perceive. So rather than wasting your money or precious time purchasing and watching the Hicks superstitious nonsense, I suggest you donate the cash to a charity or carryout charitable works to help those less fortunate than yourself; believe me you will feel much better for doing it and gain much more by having done so.",1199491200,28,3856,4.995334370139969

2791361,1,B000O76WTW,"I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this DVD set, and was extremely disappointed once I viewed it. Unfortunately the DVD seems to be one film maker's desire to jump on the curiosity bandwagon that was catapulted into action by ""The Secret"" phenomenon. This DVD does not deliver on its promise of explaining ""The Secret Behind The Secret"" nor does it provide much information about the Abraham teachings. There is a great amount of chatter and little by way of content. This DVD is not for anyone who has ever read any of the Hicks' books.

If you know nothing about the Hicks' work or the messages and teachings of Abraham, and are interested in a SMALL peak at this information, then get this DVD if you don't mind spending the money. If however you would like value for money, buy any of their books. The main part of this DVD is an incredibly long interview with the Hicks talking about their respective lives and paths that lead them to their work with Abraham. This information is available in their books - but in their books also comes an enormous amount of other practical and useful information and content that make the books worthwhile financial and time investments. This DVD set does not. Even the channelled message from Esther is a repetition of information available in their books only on a much smaller scale.

There is an entire section devoted to interviewing spectators of the DVD at a screening. This section is unnecessarily long making it appear an exercise in self-indulgence on the part of the film maker. I am certain the entire project was done with genuine and good intent, but regrettably is not what it promises to be, and is a poor investment choice if considering purchasing a product on the subject of the law of attraction and importance of emotions.

 The problem I have with it is Esther/Abraham talks with certainty about how killing animals is OK because they somehow volunteered for the duty, and, they are not afraid! I guess even non physical energy can say stupid things!!!!!
 Perhaps Abraham should watch MEET YOUR MEAT ( Google it)and see the animals being turned into meat machines and how they scream with fear and pain as they are being slaughtered. She pretty much says ""Oh well, that's the way it is"".I thought a lot of her message was about CHOICE, the choice we have to move up the emotional scale,etc. Haven't we evolved to the point that we can make a choice to take care of our planet and not to participate in the suffering of sentient beings? Doesn't participating in brutality mess with our own vibrations?",1193875200,41,1002,4.623595505617978
2791364,5,B000O76WTW,"Introducing Abraham: The Secret Behind ""The Secret"" is the spiritual glue that was missing in The Secret blockbuster talking-heads film. It's a shame that Esther Hicks' role in The Secret was edited out due to the filmmakers' conflicting contract issues. Nevertheless, this resulting DVD fills in the gaps and adds a spiritual understanding that might have been difficult to accept for The Secret's mainstream audience. In spite of my already knowing the Hicks' story and having read their books, I found this DVD so entertaining, educational and stimulating that I watched it three times in the first week.

I have several friends who are world-known psychics, who have had the pleasure of attending The Hicks seminars and say ""they are the real deal- Abraham"".

The only thing is that she should have left it as Esther's knowledge and her own answers. Rather than making it seem as if some entity from a higher consciousness named Abraham was being interviewed. The reason I say that is because in a couple of the answers, Abraham asks the interviewer as if Abraham wanted to be sure of the question. That showed hesitation in Abraham, who is from a higher consciousness, on the meaning of the interviewer's questions. Shouldn't Abraham already know the real meaning of the interviewer's question??? Also, some of Abraham's answers were vague (meaning too human) coming from a higher consciousness. For example, animals are happy to be eaten because they've signed up for it before they came into this physical world. In reality though, they run scared from their predators and defend themselves to their last breath. Since animals are in tune with their source as stated in the DVD, shouldn't they know that it is their destiny and just let it happen and be eaten??? What about animals in the slaughter house??? From that point of view Abraham lacks respect for life itself. Even though Esther is a brilliant communicator, introducing Abraham in her work makes her work less believable. Besides Abraham, I think the DVD has a wealth of information, and should be viewed from a point of view in which there is no higher consciousness answering questions.",1181433600,23,1541,4.908045977011494

I am about to watch it for the 2nd time with many more times to come. Thank you to Peter and Aura Productions; to Esther who is the Michael Jordan of ALLOWing and in that way, a role model to us all; to Jerry and his never-ending quest for answers; and, of course, to the teachings of ABRAHAM for giving us this gift. I now know (or remember) that, Life is Supposed to Be Fun....!",1179360000,12,1213,4.371681415929204
2791437,5,B000O76WTW,"At the age of nine my interest in metaphysical and spiritual subjects started to come to the fore.  As a child at that tender age I became a fervent reader of all sorts of spiritual/metaphysical books and while the books that I read in those early formative years were not difficult or deeply esoteric they were the foundation that I would use as a launching pad for deeper understanding of the spiritual laws that guide our lives.

Through reading hundreds of books on spiritual/metaphysical subjects the books that gave me the deepest understanding of the world of energies were the books of Alice A. Bailey and especially ""A Treatise on Cosmic Fire"".  While that book did great justice in explaining the world of energies as seen  through the eyes of Alice Bailey and the ""Tibetan"" who was the spiritual entity that she channelled it suffices to say that reading that book was not a task that was accessible to everyone.  Due to the complexity of that book the audience of that material was necessarily limited.

It was not until I came across the books that Neil Donald Walsh has channelled that I saw many of the spiritual attitudes that I had learned through the years being presented in a format that was easily accessible for the general public and gaining general acclaim.  When I was introduced to Esther and Jerry Hicks and the teachings of Abraham on the DVD `Introducing Abraham - The Secret Behind ""The Secret""' I recognised parts of deep spiritual/metaphysical teachings that I had learnt over many years of study.  These teachings are being presented in a format that is accessible to the general public and the core message of such a high quality as to be able to take our thinking ""to the leading edge of thought"", to quote the words of Abraham.

While it is not openly highlighted there is an anticipation within all facets of Christianity as well as in popular ""New Age"" thinking, in all totalling hundreds of millions of spiritual seekers, that the reappearance of the Christ is imminent.  I would like to suggest that the reappearance of the Christ is already taking place through a multitude of individuals including Neil Donald Walsh and Esther and Jerry Hicks and will increase as more and more individuals summon the Christ consciousness through the Law of Attraction.

My challenge to you, dear reader, is that you add your voice to those that are summoning the Christ consciousness through the Law of Attraction.  Let your first step be to introduce yourself to the message that Abraham has to offer and let your second step be to align yourself to the vibration that is needed to draw that consciousness into our physical reality.",1179100800,16,2659,4.794310722100657
2791438,1,B000O76WTW,"This was too liberal for me.  It is speaking about channeling spirits.  I'm all for the law of attraction, the law of abundance but this went too far for me.  I'm warning conservative christians that they may not like it.  Conservative Christians may like Dr. Wayne Dyer's Power of Intention DVD.  I did pass Introducing Abraham on to my liberal minded cousin.  She may enjoy it without cringing. -Johnson",1179014400,14,405,4.797101449275362

I loved the humor.

By far the most enjoyable of the Secret/ Law of Attraction DVD's I have seen",1178496000,9,304,4.611111111111111

8183313,5,B000O76WTW,"This is the story behind the phenomena of Abraham-Hicks, and goes into the history of Esther and Jerry Hicks.  I found this compelling and was what persuaded me that Abraham is genuine.  If Jerry Hicks, who was a highly intelligent man, and who knew Esther better than anyone else, was convinced of Abraham, that was good enough for me.  It didn't hurt that I was already trained in Quantum Healing Hypnosis Therapy (QHHT) as developed and taught by Dolores Cannon, author of numerous books on her work, and so knew already experientially that each of us has access to our ""higher self"" - what Abraham calls Source Energy.  The last part  of a QHHT session consists of the hypnotist talking to the client's higher self and asking a set of questions prepared in advance by the client.  And one way we know we are talking to the higher self is it ALWAYS refers to itself in the first person plural, as a collective. Just as does Abraham. I can think of no better introduction to Abraham-Hicks than this video.",1430697600,,1007,4.597765363128492
