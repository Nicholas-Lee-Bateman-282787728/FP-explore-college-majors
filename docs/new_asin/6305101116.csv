It was only 55 minutes long, but I gave up half way through. It got interesting when we saw some of the actual survivors of the Titanic - including one lady who was conceived on the Titanic. What a claim to fame. But the sound was badly transferred over from video to DVD, and no matter how much it's turned up, it's not good, and barely audible. The Titanic deserves to be remembered in better ways than this, a by-numbers DVD. I hope the rest are better.",1138752000,3,605,4.17948717948718
7882779,1,6305101116,"All five videos in the Titanic: The Mystery and the Legacy series suffer from a common affliction: they somehow seem to avoid telling the story of that dramatic night in the mid-Atlantic and end up degenerating into insufferably boring presentations.  Titanic Remembered is particularly hard to sit through.  Things start out all right; we hear some really meaningful tales of the sinking from a couple of elderly survivors; then, we start hearing some interesting stories from relatives and descendants of those who sailed on the Titanic; eventually, we start hearing from people who have no personal connection to the drama at all.  The majority of this video covers modern-day Titanic conventions and memorial services.  A whole crowd of people pile onto a small boat, and we are forced to tag along on the dullest scenic tour ever conceived, a jaunt around the dockyards from which the Titanic sailed.  There is nothing at all interesting about this.  Working our way inland, we are shown several memorials erected in memory of the Titanic's crew and passengers, but what might be interesting for a couple of minutes becomes extremely tiresome as it drags on interminably.  To make the whole experience completely galling, things conclude with us being shown a number of objects that did not come from the Titanic at all but perhaps were very similar to what might have been found there.  I can't get excited over an extended discussion over a tea kettle that admittedly has no link to the Titanic at all.  I found myself wanting to scream as this video became completely irrelevant halfway through yet continued to drag on and on and on.  Titanic Remembered is enough to make you want to forget about the Titanic altogether.",1049500800,5,1729,4.951557093425605
