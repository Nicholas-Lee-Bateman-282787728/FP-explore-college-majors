8221638,2,B000W8OMBI,"Decent film but the quality of the transfer or digitization was rather poor. It would not do to watch this on a screen larger than 15"".",1493942400,,135,4.230769230769231
8221639,4,B000W8OMBI,"I watched this film years ago & was both impressed with it. At that time, there were criticisms of what I considered minor historical inaccuracies, i.e. conversations between Joseph & Brigham contained statements that were apparently not made by those individuals until years later, but such is often the nature of docudramas, & this one was pretty good for a low-budget production. Upon recently watching the DVD, I was appalled at the horrible low quality of the transfer. It is almost unwatchable, consider this factor when purchasing this item",1471132800,,547,5.157303370786517
8221640,4,B000W8OMBI,"I enjoyed it. 4 stars is probably a bit generous, however. I arrived home from work this evening, and the husband said he was watching ""a movie about 1830 Central NY"". He knew nothing more, but he had my attention, as a NY family historian. It was soon apparent this was a historic film about the early Mormon church, of which a number of my ancestors were members. While this is somewhat low budget, it seemed fairly accurate from the history I have read. I don't think a ""super Hollywood production"" would have suited this story of ordinary rural folk who became enchanted by charismatic  leaders espousing spiritual ideals, at times to the detriment of their personal lives.",1451952000,,677,4.737288135593221
8221641,3,B000W8OMBI,"This is a savage movie like its title, but my girlfriend and I were in this movie as extras and we had such a great time during our small parts that we wanted to see the finished product! It was filmed in the '70's when we were in high school..",1386201600,,244,3.9
8221642,5,B000W8OMBI,I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for all of my life and I have served a two year mission in Europe.  I am open minded to other people's beliefs and I give everything that comes out about the Mormons a fair shake.  That being said I praise this movie very highly as one can see from the five star review.  The reason for the high rating is that this movie starring Richard Moll as the Prophet Joseph Smith is one of the best depictions of the persecution that was unfairly endured by the saints in the Early LDS Church.  There are a few inaccuracies but they are minor.  I also consider myself a historian so I have looked at things written in favor of the Church and things against the Church.  For those that do not know who Moll is he was Bull on the TV Series Night Court.  He gives a sympathetic portrait of the Prophet.  This is a very good film and it is a great adventure story also.  On a historical note and if anyone is interested the Prophet Joseph Smith was fully justified in the destruction of the printing press because it was inciting the people in Illinois to turn violent against the saints who were innocent people who had a different belief than others did and that was their only crime.  Also the State of Missouri who persecuted the saints first in the year 1975 issued an executive order by the governor that gave a full redress and apology to the saints and the Church for the mob violence that was endured in the middle 1800's by the early saints.  In the year 1989 a conference of the Illinois legislature was held and it also gave a full apology and a redress for what happened to the saints in Illinois.  Savage Journey is a good film that is a fairly accurate of the persecution of the Mormons and it is a good piece about frontier history also.,1277510400,4,1813,4.284457478005865
8221643,1,B000W8OMBI,"""Savage Journey,"" presented by the Television Corporation of America, is the story of the founding of the Mormon Church, and the trials that Joseph Smith and Brigham Young endured for their faith. While technically in color, the film is really black and gray, and counts as one of the darkest, gloomiest viewing experiences in history: frequently it's difficult to even follow the action and the characters involved. The pacing is turgid and the film is too long by about fifty percent. (How many lynchings do we need to see?)

The early Mormons undergo the humiliation of being tarred and feathered, having their barns burned, being shot, and being insulted by gangs of bigoted idiots. My favorite insult was this sharp barb hurled at Brigham Young: ""Do you think I look like a gorilla?"" I guess the reflexive nature of that bon mot makes it highly offensive and witty, at least in theory. Non-LDS churchgoers are seen to behave in all sorts of unappealing ways: howling like dogs in church was a new one for me.

The Mormons are persecuted in the Midwest, and eventually Brigham Young has a meeting with President Martin Van Buren, who refuses to get involved to stop the harassment of Mormons by local militias. He can't help; it's an election year after all. Joseph gets the townspeople in an uproar by endorsing polygamy, and his wife goes for it in a big way. Joseph founds the town of Nauvoo, Illinois and becomes mayor. When his policies on polygamy are widely derided he makes a proclamation to shut down the paper and destroy the printing press. While the film tries to make Smith look like the victim of big government persecution in this case, there was an obvious freedom of speech issue involved. I'm not endorsing the ultimate fate of Smith as he gets tossed out a jailhouse window by another mob of heathens, but I had difficulty feeling sorry for his plight in this matter given the director's heavy-handed approach. Therein lies the central problem with this film: the ""heroes"" just aren't that heroic, or even likeable.

After Smith dies, Brigham Young sets the Mormon nation on course for Utah. Much of the film is devoted to the hardships intrinsic to taking Conestoga wagons over the Rocky mountains, but it's clear that the Salt Lake area is the promised land. They plant crops (this is a boring little stretch of film), but locusts come in a huge swarm to devour it. After endless closeups of grasshoppers eating foliage, Young prays for divine intervention and a huge flock of seagulls come to eat the locusts. There are other subplots about war with Mexico, about psychic predictions of the Civil War, and about conflict with Native Americans, but frankly they're all tedious and too boring to go into.

For so many dramatic things to happen in a film and have the final product be so relentlessly boring is a statement about both the script and the direction. Some of the acting was modestly strong, and an interesting casting decision definitely enlivened the proceedings: Richard Moll played Joseph Smith. Moll, best known as the not terribly bright ""Bull"" in the television series ""Night Court"" as the fiery polygamist in a hairpiece made apparently from yak fur, provides some unintentional comic relief. He struggles mightily with the role, but the stars didn't really seem to align, and it never really worked.

This is a terrible and terribly made movie, both of which are forgivable sins. What isn't forgivable is the horrifying boringness of the film: ""Savage Journey"" may well seem like the longest 96 minutes of your life.",1222128000,2,3560,4.848684210526316
