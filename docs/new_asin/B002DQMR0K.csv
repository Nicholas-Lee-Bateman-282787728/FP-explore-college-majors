Within a matter of minutes, I was able to ""grasp"" a thorough knowledge to the basics of a home computer. Not only have I learned how to build a computer, but also how to troubleshoot. This will save me lots of money on repairs in the future. It's basically a ""two-for-one"" deal! And for the price? What a steal!",1343088000,,443,4.481481481481482
8365769,5,B002DQMR0K,"This is the most up-to-date and helpful of the DIY computer building guides. I like to read a book, and there are several good and fairly up to date ones out, but not only is this guide thorough and accurate,it is updated annually, and the author's website(same name as the DVD)is updated even more frequently. Choose the book that suits you, but certainly use this DVD as a graphic illustration of each step. Enough talk. Go and buy it!",1258502400,3,437,4.544303797468355
8365770,5,B002DQMR0K,I just received my dvd-I am a stay at home mom with a really tight budget and very little computer knowledge and was skeptical whether I could do this. I watched the dvd and was surprised at how detailed the directions are. I can honestly say it was so simple and now my computer is running faster and I am so happy with the outcome. Thanks for such a great product!,1245974400,7,366,4.169014084507042
8365771,5,B002DQMR0K,"When I ordered this how to DVD, I figured with a little concentration, I might be able to build a computer by watching it.  I never dreamed how easy this DVD actually would make the process.  Anyone, and I mean anyone, could do it with all the simple to follow instructions.

I am so pleased with myself for how easily and speedily I got my computer put together. I expected to at least have to redo a step or two, but with the precise details on this DVD, the first time was the charm.

If you want to save money and feel a sense of accomplishment when you proudly tell your friends that ""I did it myself"", I strongly recommend Home PC Builder 2009.  It is definately the way to go!",1245801600,5,683,4.183206106870229
