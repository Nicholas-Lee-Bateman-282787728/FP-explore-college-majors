8137624,5,B000H8SFAM,"Anyone interested in the art of the  French melodie and German  lieder repertoire should treasure this DVD of the legendary baritone Gerard Souzay. The release is from the 60's archives  of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and, as such, lacks the sonic and visual definition of more modern recording techniques. Still, the absolute beauty of Souzay's voice as a young singer shines through and his renditions of Duparc's Phidyle and Chanson Triste are magnificent, giving a visual picture of his commitment that audio recording alone could never fully convey.

Equally important here if the documentary on an older Souzay as voice teacher at the 1977 Quebec Orford Festival. The voice audio is in French and may not be understandable to those unfamiliar with the language. However, Souzay's French is clear, slow and easily understood and he does occasionally speak in English. It is wonderful to see how an older and wiser singer of world stature conveys his advice to younger, but eager students.

Altogether a DVD release to be treasured by lovers of classical song",1287705600,4,1074,5.149425287356322
