8692105,2,B00QMWEHMM,"I was so excited to finally see this on DVD.  I had two episodes on VHS when I was younger and wanted to be able to watch them again, because the tapes got lost in one of my moves.  Unfortunately one of the TWO episodes that I love, was not very well transferred onto the DVD, because their was not sound for almost half of the show.  It was very disappointing.  Just be careful of this, but it was cool to see some of the other episodes.",1496188800,,438,4.0

8692107,4,B00QMWEHMM,I used to watch this show all the time in my youth.  I only remembered the name but looked it up and here it was!  I was surprised that it was only 13 episodes on 1 disc... it felt like there was a lot more than that.,1484438400,,217,3.595744680851064

8692112,5,B00QMWEHMM,"I was really happy that one of my favorite cartoons of that time. The series always made me think of an animated home alone since the first 2 home alone movies had the son's Christmas wish come true,  This felt to me like Home Alone family without all the holiday relatives visiting  and the son voice by the actor from first two Home Alone movies getting his wish each week.  The only problem I had with this tape was the episode where  the McClary wishes for new parents as a small section where it looses audio.  Otherwise it a great set worth owning for either fans  of slap stick type of toons Warner Brothers original known for or even Home Alone films.",1430179200,2,659,4.360655737704918
