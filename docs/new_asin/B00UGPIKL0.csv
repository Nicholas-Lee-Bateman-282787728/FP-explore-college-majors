7039014,3,B00UGPIKL0,"I never have written a negative review, however, I have been waiting for a long time for the 3rd season of ""How the West Was Won"" to be released, and when I got it I loved the movies, but the quality of the dvds was terrible...The first time I watched it the movie would hesitate then start and come to a stop and continue. I was dissapointed in the performance of the dvds.",1461369600,9,374,4.136986301369863
7039015,5,B00UGPIKL0,"This is great news, Season 3 of the outstanding Frontier series starring James Arness as Zeb Macahan originally telecast in 1979 as The Macahans is coming to DVD. Also starring  Bruce Boxleitner as Luke Macahan, Zeb and his family struggle against a variety of evils in order to settle in the west in this highly thrilling adventure series.
This is one of the BEST series ever to be on television, it was said that James Arness was highly thrilled with this character after playing Marshall Matt Dillon for 20 + years, a lot of compassion is in this role. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!

Update: April 21
This season is slightly different than season 2 in that each episode is like a separate movie in itself- they don't end up as cliff-hangers. James Arness has limited appearances in some episodes, it was nice to see him get together with Ken 'Festus' Curtis again in episode 5.

7039018,1,B00UGPIKL0,"I returned our first purchase of this dvd because the 2nd disc would not play at all. We just started the replacement and the same thing happened, 2nd disc would not play. We went on to the 3rd disc, and it freezes in spots, takes forever to get it going again, so will send this one back too. I don't think we will try this again........who ever is making these dvds need to do some product checking before mailing out to consumers....The dvds were supposed to be made for an american player, what they act like, is that they are made for out of country players.

However, it is good enough to still enjoy one of the best shows ever made. Love the show...although the last few shows started to go down hill. No subtitles and not packages every well but....better than not having it at all.",1506816000,,352,4.268656716417911

7039025,4,B00UGPIKL0,"This western got much better in its 3rd and final season. Each episode originally aired as a 2 hour movie and was avle to develop characters and complicated plot structures.  There are no special features but each episode had amazing guest stars.  After this series ended in 1979, Westerns pretty much ceased until Lonesome Dove and the Gunsmoke TV movies a decade later.",1502323200,,371,4.873015873015873

7039042,4,B00UGPIKL0,The final installment of a great 70s series.  If you're a fan of James Arness this is a great show for you.  I like the fact that the long play shows are divided by an intermission.  If you don't have time to watch a full episode this gives you a logical stopping point.  It would have been nice if they had offered some extras.,1484611200,,328,4.078125

7039072,3,B00UGPIKL0,"I guess I was expecting different ending. I thought there was more to disk 6 than the one part. To me it ended unfinished. I thought Luke would go back and marry the sheriff's daughter. As other poster said, I hadn't realized that he was cleared in the disks before and was waiting to find out who really killed the person, when it wasn't the one that took the blame for it. I kept going back to check my disks to see if I missed any of the episodes, as I thought it didn't make sense to me, but I can't find anything else. All in all, though, it was still a good miniseries. I had two of the disks that skipped a little at places, but not enough to send back, as afraid they all might be like that.",1471132800,2,699,4.0

7039136,5,B00UGPIKL0,"This is the culmination to a terrific series of westerns. This 3rd season is not quite as highly rated as the first two, meaning this is only very good compared to great. The episodes in this season are more stand-alone than in previous season but with continuing characters but not the whole family in each story. The stories are a definite cut above the standard western in tension and avoiding complete western clich. If you've seen the first 2 series you'll want to get this one as soon as you find out it's been released. IF you haven't seen the first 2 seasons and you like westerns, you'll love these. James Arness and the fellow family members are terrific. Can't stop watching type excitement here.",1468454400,4,707,4.664

  At the Very End of Season Number Two { 2 }, Luke was Cleared of ALL Charges, so why did Luke Continue to have the Law coming Down on him in Season # 3?  On a Scale of One { 1 } through Ten { 10 }, in my own Opinion, I would have to go Rating tis Particular Season to be Absouility",1467849600,,507,3.5636363636363635
