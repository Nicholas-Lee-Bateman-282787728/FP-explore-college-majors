6935593,4,B00RU9UHZW,"Isn't it annoying when other reviewers just write the words to the theme song in their review?  Thanks, we didn't hear it a million times back in the day.

Anyway, good set.",1523404800,,173,4.375

6935595,5,B00RU9UHZW,"Although I was only a few years old when ""Hey Dude"" premiered, I caught the show during reruns only a couple years after it ended and enjoyed it quite a bit. For YEARS after reruns stopped I would catch myself singing the theme song and once television shows started being released on DVD I had high hopes for many of the classic Nickelodeon shows to finally come out.

The show follow new ranch owner Mr. Ernst, his son, and a gang of teenage ranch hands who work the summers to make some extra money while getting into a lot of crazy situations together. Even though a lot of the normal tv show tropes are there, along with a lot of eye-rolling dialogue, the show's nostalgia will bring you back to when you first watch it and entertain new viewers.

I recently purchased Shout Factory's complete series set of ""Hey Dude"" and as always they don't disappoint. You get all 65 episodes, along with an interview with Christine Taylor who plays Melody. Each season spans two discs and even for a show close to 30 years, the picture quality looks great on newer televisions.",1518134400,,1070,4.538860103626943

If you grew up in the late 80s/early 90s, you know how great this show was! Guess what? Still great 27+ years laterNostalgia at its finest.
When this show was on the TV at our house, it was time for my brother and sister to sit down and watch it with me instead of fighting over whatever stupid things we fought about as kids.
Whats the show about? A father from the city buys a dude ranch and bring his young son, who is not so happy about it. The series takes place on the ranch. The show has a variety of different characters you can identify with.
Sick of the crap thats on now? Go ahead, spend the $18, you won't be disappointed.
Its a show for the whole family, although younger kids might not get the jokes but will laugh at some of the shenanigans.
While video quality is not what it is today, if you can look past that, its a great show.
Unlike some of the other reviews, my DVDs came in the mail with no damage. Happy they released all seasons at once- thank you for that!

6935600,5,B00RU9UHZW,"Words cannot properly describe just how much this television series was A gigantic part of my life! I would come home from school and watch this great show as A kid everyday for hours on end. When I saw this for sale I absolutely jumped at the chance to buy it! When I finally got it I was presently surprised to discover it still holds up quite nicely. Now,I might have been wearing nostalgia glasses when I watched this,but I thought unlike A lot of other things when I was younger which really doesn't hold up as well as I remember them to-this show does not suffer from this whatsoever. In fact,there's parts that are actually better than I remembered them being.

However,to anyone who hadn't grown up with this show you might not appreciate it as much as the old school Fans like myself do. So,you might not give it the respect it's due since you don'y have A heavy respect for the nostalgia that this series properly deserves. Who know,you might,but I seriously suggest watching it with someone who does then maybe you can grow An appreciation for it.

Overall,Hey Dude is such A part of who I am and what I was that it has A special place in my heart and that's why for those who remember it as fondly as I do-you should definitely get get it and get it fast!",1505088000,,1267,4.364406779661017

6935615,5,B00RU9UHZW,"Great collection.  All the shows from those afternoons on nickelodeon years ago when I got hooked on it watching with the youngest child (now grown and with kids of her own who love it too).  We've been watching it with the grand kid and he gets just as big a kick out of it as his Mother did back then.

Shout factory did a good job.  Maybe a little too compressed but no complaints from yours truly.  The shows are watchable on the 4K TV and look as good as they're ever gonna be (which ain't bad really - don't get me wrong).

So if you remember the Bar None and the kids that worked there along with Mr. Ernst and the rest of the crew then this collection is made for you.

Buy it while you can.  You know Ted's home watching it right now!!!!",1464220800,7,746,4.061643835616438

6935617,4,B00RU9UHZW,"This show is great, the characters are largely believable, the stories are entertaining, and the cast has a few people in it that will make you go ""Hey, I know them!""  Being shot entirely on an actual ranch, even with sets built specifically for the show, certainly doesn't hurt at all.

There is, in fact, only one problem with this set, and it's not the fault of the set or the people who assembled it: a few episodes are very low quality.  One in particular during the 3rd season seems like a home copy of the TV broadcast.  This is, of course, because the show was filmed and edited on tape, which doesn't hold up as well as film when stored.  And storage was probably not optimal as very few cable channels foresaw the home video market we have today.

All in all, if you have kids or just want a good nostalgia trip for your younger days watching Nickelodeon, this is DEFINITELY something you want to own.",1461024000,4,911,4.392857142857143

8695851,4,B00RU9UHZW,"The show is fun and family friendly, that moves along at a relaxing pace, without any spastic modern editing or dumb humor. It focuses on a group of teens that work at a Arizona guest ranch, with their antics and pseudo-drama, with nothing too mature, except for a little G-rated dating. I find it corny and endearing and you get every episode for cheap (mine was around $15).

This set has every episode in the exact same quality they were broadcast, except for one slightly-controversial episode that had to be sourced from VHS. The special features are slim to none but are interesting nonetheless. The way the discs are held in the box is a bit flimsy and was broken when I received it, but there are small pieces you can remove and flip around to fix it. Unfortunately the box took a tumble and it broke again so the plastic pages that hold the discs have come loose, which isn't really a big deal if you just stick them in the case and shut it. The discs themselves have full color art and are clearly labelled.

Now bring out ""Salute Your Shorts"" DVD please!",1534464000,,1065,4.456410256410257
