6075768,5,B00GHH9HAO,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot)com says: Since the beginning of organized religion, a person, or group of people, could count on being skewered if they dared to stand up and talk of discontent. Going up against that force also guaranteed your being noticed...or burnt at the stake, broken on a wheel; general consider-it-done torturings post proclamations. Nothing ever really changes kids.

Back in February of 2012 a small group of women punk rock musicians took their song of protest quite literally onto the alter to give their sermon of protest. In bright masks and little dresses, a group that had been, until then, shouting out on the streets of Moscow, got heard around the world. They called themselves Pussy Riot, and they opened up a s***-storm with their 40 second performance on Moscows Cathedral of Christs hallowed stage, um, altar.

Before security could get all of them to stop, the brave gals sprang onto the altar area and began to flash-sing their lyrics of protest for government / church collusion (God S*** is the title?). Onlookers were dumbfounded, and in the melee the group got away.

Not for long. Because up on the list of least tolerable places to live, Russia, shines like bright evil death star. The Russian government hunted down and arrested three of the five in performance that day. The charges were extreme and seriously distorted. Smelling blood, the media flocked. And what would have been a sentence of probation now brought a nation, then the world, in to watch  and lend their own opinions (truth based or not ;depending) towards the case. It was now an event.

The seconds-long show was portrayed as an act of religious hate-mongers  that sold more papers and upset more comrades. The three girls were put in a cage and asked to dance for the courts.

By the time court came about, many had heard of the act, and the vilifying, and tuned in; a side firmly chosen. The saner of the hordes understood that beneath the headlines, Pussy Riots small act of defiance was being blown up into a twirling dervish's convention of accusations to help railroad anyone who would dare to speak up and out against the state of things.

And the documentary, Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer, from the performance through the whole court proceeding shows you exactly the state of things; and of power of state and church in Russia.

The film makers don't choose a side; they do not have to. The film interviews expose the snowballing of everything. They interview a group of wildly enthusiastic priests that think the charged girls are nothing less than witches and bemoan that in 1670 theyd have burned them  case closed. It is wonderful (and terrifying) to watch these men-of-God and their hypocrisy unedited before you.

The groups name is explained to throngs in the street: pussy is not just a little innocent kitten but a uterus  but not really it is slang meaning a ""deranged vagina"".

Now an international news story, Pussy Riot was given a platform. And from their cage they spoke out even more. They really couldn't have asked for a larger spotlight! Now, all ears and cameras on them, the captured Pussy Riot members give eloquent dagger-strike comments on issues that need to be addressed for women and the countries people  its brilliant.

The wonderfully ironic part is those who seriously attempted to nail them to the metaphorical cross managed to make the Pussy Riot a relevant and substantial voice for all people who want to be heard, everywhere.

8623139,2,B00GHH9HAO,"RELEASED IN 2013 and directed by Mike Lerner & Maxim Pozdorovkin, ""Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer"" is a documentary about the feminist/anti-Putin Russian punk rock collective, Pussy Riot, and the arrest & trial of three of its main members (Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich) for their offensive protest performance at a Moscow cathedral in 2012 wherein they were charged with hooliganism motivated by enmity toward a religious group and disturbing the social order.

I have an obvious message for these three women (aged 22, 23 and 29 respectively at the time of the events): If you don't want to go to jail don't enact hateful criminal protests. Let me put it this way: What if several conservative Christians visited whatever dive they perform at and carried out a mocking, hostile rant against them and their ilk? Theyd be incensed and immediately put a stop to it, not to mention press charges to prevent it from happening again.

Speaking of performing, the girls music is laughably trite punk ditties. Separated from the political hype, their cacophonies wouldnt register even a blip on the punk/rock/metal barometer.

A couple of the females are asked what they're protesting against and one of them says they're objecting to the (supposed) Russian expectation of women to have babies and do little else in society. But (1.) no ones forcing her or anyone else to have babies and (2.) the movie itself shows women in all kinds of significant professions in Russia, including two judges, a prominent lawyer and police officers. Its a classic case of rebel without a cause. If they don't like Putin, fine, vote against him and look into becoming a politician. If you don't like the conservative sway in current Russian culture, then do your part to respectfully influence society to your point of view, which would include offering a positive example of your (supposedly superior) belief system.

Instead, these women opted for outrageous acts in their 3-year protest against the Russian government, culminating in the sacrilegious incident at the Russian Orthodox cathedral: They stuck poultry up their you-know-whats in supermarkets, spray-painted vulgar graffiti on bridges, staged an unbelievable public orgy at a museum when Nadya was eight-months pregnant, which is actually shown in the movie for like 10 seconds (two clips). Seriously? In response, Putin expressed Im surprised they weren't arrested prior to this. So am I.

The flick is evenhanded in that it lacks a biased narration and simply shows the actual footage, translating the Russian verbiage into English, with a smattering of interviews with parents, husbands and whoever. Its a fascinating documentary in that it reveals modern Russian culture, its predominant values and lunatic fringe. I was surprised to observe that the elder disciples of the Russian Orthodox Church resemble formidable American bikers more than anything else.

Despite these positives, Im not giving the film a higher rating because it foolishly sides with the girls. Which is baffling since anyone with a modicum of common sense can see that they got precisely what their doofus behavior deserved. If a group of conservatives in America did what these women did, but enacted toward liberal people & institutions, theyd be lambasted by the lamestream media and imprisoned for years for hooligan hate crimes. Of course loony libertines are notorious for their hypocritical double standards.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 28 minutes.

The court system is a joke and so is the police state.  I support artistic freedom, thus they should have never gone to jail as a ""show trial"" that is always popular in Russia.  They show some Russian Orthodox Christian group that looks like a bunch of backward motorcycle clodhoppers.  The prosecution lacked any sense or evidence, the judge was some imperious nitwit.

What is even worse of a joke is the popular ""marketing"" of the band in the Europe and USA, from famous millionaire pops stars wearing their t-shirts to lesbian clothes designers taping their lips shut with black tape.  I'm sure you'll be able to get the clothes line at the Gap soon.

8623146,5,B00GHH9HAO,"I'm not sure how they got tagged as a ""punk"" band. Sounds more to me like club music with shouted lyrics and some guitar/bass fuzz. Call it what you will but I think the rawness and spontaneity is wonderful. I was mesmerised with the film because it is astonishing that in this day and age you can be thrown in jail for performing protest songs. Which is what they are. And they should be applauded for pulling off ""guerilla"" performances with gear you can carry around in grocery store bags.
it doesnt matter if they make records or not. In fact I think that would defeat the entire concept. The ""what the hell just happened"" approach is WHY this works. Its meant to get your attention and it certainly does. And the name ""pussy riot"" is frickin ingenious. How can you ignore THAT? Conjures up the image of pissed off cats (perhaps?) with gas masks. AND you get transistor distorto guitar w feedback, stunning pyrotechics via road flares and fire extingwhishers.. No way that can be bad in MY book.
Now I'm not russian, I have never lived or even been there. But despite the facade of a new and improved Russia its pretty clear to me at least that core principles haven't changed much. There are STILL societies where women are treated as second class (or worse) citizens and thats what seems to me is happening here. I fail to understand how a president or country with an entire army at its disposal feels ""threatened"" by pussy riot. How do they not realise that throwing them in prison is giving them a WORLD STAGE?
If they were men doing this, I think it would be a different story. Just my opinion.",1420675200,3,1604,4.4965753424657535
