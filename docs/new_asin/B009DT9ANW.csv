5321993,5,B009DT9ANW,WOW!!! Don't miss out on this one. Peter got his guitar back and he is playing better than ever and he always was top notch in my opinion.,1353024000,,138,3.9642857142857144
5321994,5,B009DT9ANW,"We went to the Show that Peter performed at the Pabst Theater. The band was great, he was great, and it was wonderful to hear his recently found (after so many years) guitar. This disc captures the spirit of the Show completely. Frampton is a great guitarist, and a wonderful guy. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1352851200,13,318,4.5964912280701755
5321995,5,B009DT9ANW,"At Frampton's  Paramount Theater show , this past March , my wife and I were both amazed & inspired ! It is simply one of the best concerts we have attended !!! The DVDs are incredible sounding , and  visually sharp - a wonderful reminder of  why we loved the show !!!",1352851200,6,268,4.115384615384615
5321996,2,B009DT9ANW,"My husband surprised me with this DVD.  I'm a huge Frampton fan.  Was so looking forward to seeing this.  The DVD set contained two DVD's.  I was so disappointed when I received two ""DVD 2's"" and was missing ""DVD 1.""  Had to return it.",1352851200,2,235,4.25

5322001,5,B009DT9ANW,"I saw the original tour in '76 in the Orlando Tangerine Bowl & he  rocked back then & rocked now.
We saw the FCA 35 tour at Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, FL & he was amazing!
The FCA portion of the concert was just like the ole days & the second portion of newer\vintage stuff
was on point.
Such a performer as well as one of the most under-rated guitarist of all time & I've seen many of them in my time.
The dvd was a perfect view into his music,heart & passion for pure rock & roll!
I am so glad I got this...brings back so many memories of my youth & adult life.
It must be super gratifying when everyone in the concert hall can sing all your songs word for word!
His version on While My Guitar Gently Weeps is probably best overall best version ever done & that includes the original Harrison\Clapton version & Petty\Prince version too!
Pure fretboard genius Frampton !
Thanks Peter!",1468195200,,890,4.266272189349112

5322009,5,B009DT9ANW,THE BEST EVER!,1445904000,,14,4.0
5322010,5,B009DT9ANW,"The supremely lyrical guitarist Peter Frampton's entire career arc is captured on this concert film of extremes from the magic that was FCA to the meh quality of the rest of his career. The original FCA was pure joy and loads of fun, this section of the concert is even more so. Peter's playing is exceptional and in his own style, beyond peer. The problem with this film is the second half. Somebody should have stood up to Peter and said ""OK, pick your best 3 or 4 non-FCA career songs as encores, then get off."" Instead we have several, not just the one song featuring his son who is frankly not that great as a singer, wooden and totally ill at ease with the material. When Peter Gabriel did the same with his daughter it was downright uncomfortable; when Robbie Williams did the same with his mate Jonny Wilkes it was dreadful, almost career-killing schmaltz. The rest is long, meandering, surprisingly (relative to the first half) uninspired waffle and playing for the rest of the show that I truly struggle to stick through. Even inspired covers of While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Black Hole Sun unfairly come off as bloated and self-indulgent. Five stars for the first half of the show, 1 star if that for the second!
PS: It's interesting to note that Peter Frampton was schoolyard buddies with David Bowie: same accent, same humour, same beautiful grin, same sunny disposition on life. Put David Bowie's excellent Reality Tour film on and the similarities are striking!",1445040000,,1479,4.714285714285714

5322012,3,B009DT9ANW,It's ok but I think Live in Detroit is much better. Better players and better sound. Tighter and Frampton at his best.,1443398400,,118,4.409090909090909

5322014,5,B009DT9ANW,"I have had the pleasure to have seen Peter Frampton 5 times dating back to the late 1970's.  It is hard to imagine, but his guitar playing is getting better.  This is a great showcase of his fantastic Frampton Comes Alive album.  It is cool that he has his bass player from that album in the band.  His band is tight and really gives the tunes an updated sound.  The cool thing is that Peter is having a blast playing these songs.  The second half of the show features other Peter Frampton songs and a few cool covers as well, most notably While My Guitar gently Weeps.

I've never been a huge fan of the bonus interviews and things of that nature on DVD's, however this one has a must see.  You have to see the piece on how Peter got his black Les Paul custom back after thinking it has been destroyed for over 30 years.",1437177600,3,821,4.1847133757961785

5322018,5,B009DT9ANW,What a great way to celebrate 35 years. Peter Frampton and his band did a great job of recreating on moment in time and history. I've only had this DVD for a week and have watched it twice already. A must have for any Peter Frampton fan!,1425513600,,237,4.0638297872340425

5322026,5,B009DT9ANW,"I stumbled upon this and started listening to parts of it, and had to hear the whole thing. I had the original ""Frampton Comes Alive"", and saw Peter on that famous mid-'70s tour for the album after it shattered all records for live album sales. THIS anniversary edition is as good, and in my opinion, actually BETTER than the original. How do you top the original? That's the usual question. Well, Mr. Frampton, one of the most underrated guitar players in history, and a terrific singer and song-writer has accomplished just that. THIS album IS better, and that's a huge deal. I highly recommend this DVD, and I own about 35 concert DVDs. This in my top five fav. list of my own library of concert DVDs. If you like Peter, the original album, rock guitarists, live rock concerts, '70s music, etc. This album will make you a happy camper. One of the best ever. He adds some surprises to the original. Like his rendition of George Harrison's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps""-a song I've been playing as a guitar player for decades. Peter is a great performer and artist, and STILL remains humble after all these years. Great DVD!",1406419200,,1126,4.635

5322029,3,B009DT9ANW,If you like Frampton and guitar players in general this is a good selection. HIs son (Julian) actually sings on a few songs and has a star quality himself. Excellent quality video and sound.,1405209600,,190,4.617647058823529

5322031,1,B009DT9ANW,"As Peter demonstrates in this video, he still has a wonderful voice and skillfully plays the guitar. The reason that I will not keep this video or recommend it is because, I do not like when my favorite songs get ruined during a live performance by altering the songs with unnecessary and distracting audience interaction. I prefer to hear the original skillfully played, clear songs all the way through to the end. Today I purchased the CD - Peter Frampton Classics Volume 12 and love it !",1402790400,3,490,4.64367816091954
5322032,5,B009DT9ANW,"I wasn't actually a huge Frampton fan back in his heyday, but I've rediscovered him in recent years and come to really appreciate him.  In this DVD, he looks like a balding and hunched old man, but his guitar playing is still full of chops, creativity, and soul, and his singing is quite good too.  This is in the context of good songs from start to finish, and a backing band which is tight and solid.  Another nice aspect is that, being an established senior musician, Frampton doesn't take himself too seriously and jokes around quite a bit.

I've enjoyed this DVD and can recommend it, without reservations, to fans of Frampton, guitar, and/or classic rock.",1400198400,,661,4.672413793103448

5322051,5,B009DT9ANW,"I went and saw this tour when it came to Calgary Alberta, and therefore had to snag the video.  Peter Frampton lost his original guitar in a plane crash, but has it back for parts of this.",1367193600,,188,4.081081081081081
5322052,5,B009DT9ANW,"I have been a Frampton fan all my life and he was the first person i saw in
concert,more than 35 years ago,just before the Frampton Comes Alive and
have seen him many times since than. He puts on great shows and love to
hear all his songs both old and new.
  I had just found out about this FCA 35 TOUR: EVENING WITH PETER
FRAMPTON [BLUE RAY] and had to get it. With this you get around 2 hours
45 minutes of the complete FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE,then some of his
new songs. I am very happy i got it because it is a great show,like he has been
doing all these years,with great sound+picture and well worth it.
  I have both the Frampton Comes Alive II and the concert in Detroit DVD,
but i must say this is the best one of them. Its great to have it in BLUE RAY
and if you are a old fan of his,or anyone who is new with him,you cant go
wrong with this one.

  PS: The last time i saw Frampton in concert was in 2009 and didn't think.
With the help of this BLUE RAY show i found out about Bob Mayo (RIP)
  I didn't know he had past away and we all lost a great keyboard,guitar+
vocalist. We all miss YOU and will never forget YOU.",1364169600,,1125,3.920704845814978

5322054,5,B009DT9ANW,"I enjoyed this DVD, I would recommend watching the bonus feature first.  It is well worth the price for how many hours this DVD plays.  Peter Frampton is even better now than when he was younger, a master guitar player.",1363996800,,219,4.45

5322057,5,B009DT9ANW,"A lot of accolades have already been written so this will be short. Obviously if you're a fan you'll love it. For me Frampton has always just been a so so FM staple guitar player. And while he may not be considered a virtuoso player his playing here is excellent. Great show. Guys enjoying themselves on stage and playing their hearts out. Direction is good for a concert video. Not too much cut and pan. Small intimate venues. Video quality is great. HD 5.1 audio is freaking EXCELLENT!

This is well worthy of any concert blu ray collection. And if you have a good system you're really going to want to crank it up...kick back and enjoy!",1360281600,,639,4.461538461538462

Not only did it meet my expectations, it surppassed it with the newer songs, but more for the Humble Pie songs. The video is amazing. Other directors, please take note how this was shot. Timely, good editing, good distance, good closeups.

The audio was phenomenal. I highly recommend this as a buy.",1360281600,,385,4.833333333333333
5322059,5,B009DT9ANW,"Very surprised - and happy - to see that a large share of this was filmed at our local Pabst Theater in Milwaukee - a great old building and venue for more intimate concerts.  Frampton hasn't lost his guitar playing prowess, his vocals are still strong, though he does struggle a little with the high notes - and his bandmates are good players to back him up.",1360108800,,359,4.358208955223881
5322060,5,B009DT9ANW,"My wife has been a Peter Frampton fan since day one. This was bought as a Christmas gift to her to celebrate the 35(!) years since the FCA album and it does not disappoint. As hard rockers from the 70's, this will prove to be a valuable asset to any true rock enthusiast. Peter Frampton is one of the timeless classic performers who never gets older, just better with time. I have seen him live through out the United States on numerous occasions and even though it's mostly the same songs we grew up with, his live performances never get old. Add some of his new material (Thank You, Mr. Churchill, which is not on here), and it's always the best sound from one of rock's greatest. Needless to say, my wife loves this DVD/BD. You will NOT be disappointed.",1359590400,2,756,4.4071428571428575

5322066,4,B009DT9ANW,"Did not see the shows in Milwaukee or NYC where the recordings were made (until now)
Lots of great guitar solos and a solid band backing up Peter.
Great new versions of some past favorites. There are some great Humble Pie favorites on here too.
Extra interview on how Peter was reunited with his famous Les Paul was an interesting feature.
I feel lots of great music is to come in the future being he has this great instrument back in his artistic hands.
I got to see him on the last date of his US tour in Nashville. This DVD brings back great memories of that show even though it was not recorded there.",1357344000,,605,4.269565217391304
5322067,5,B009DT9ANW,Fca 35 Tour: An Evening With Peter Frampton [Blu-ray] was a great concert with all the songs you remember. The band played & sounded awesome! Peter is such a great player & preformer that it's very enjoyable. Even his son gets in on the act. this disc is one of Peter's best.,1357344000,,275,4.3076923076923075
5322068,4,B009DT9ANW,"I thought is was a pretty awesome recording, but the original recording is definitely his best. This is pretty cool because he redid all the songs from his 1st live ""Frampton Comes Alive"" double album and changed up alot of arrangment's and added somewhat different lead solo's to keep the music fresh.
I do give him credit for this, although sometimes I was waiting for that signature solo I was use to...with that being said; This is still a very nice recording and the band is tighter than ever(minus Bob Mayo,keyboard, guitar and John Siomos,drums).Their replacements are still very good. All being said; Frampton can still deliver the goods, even at 62yrs. If you you like Peter F. you will surly enjoy this 2 dvd set.

The perfection of Peter Framptons Talent blows the doors off most Rock Guitar heroes of yesterday and Today! The Quality of the Live Video Recording was Superb! Anyone who is a Frampton Comes Alive Fan must have this DVD! You will love it as much as I do!",1356825600,,368,4.271428571428571
5322071,5,B009DT9ANW,"I went to this concert in Memphis, and it was great. I've seen Frampton 4 times now (starting with the original FCA tour 35 years ago), and he never disappoints. The 2nd DVD in this set is as good in its own way as the the 1st (which is a song for song recreation of the original album). His son appears to be a talented singer in his own right and accompanies on 2 tracks. Audio and Video are excellent. Can you wear out a DVD? If it's possible, then I might do it on this one.",1356652800,,478,3.9381443298969074

Putting this disc in for the first time, I watched the entire FCA song line-up all the way through...there was no stopping this one! The major thing I want to say in this review is that the band Frampton has currently/on this disc is, IMO, as tight and rocking as the band he had on the original 1976 recording...Bob Mayo & John Siomos, R.I.P. - they were some big rock & roll shoes to fill but these guys carry on their tradition wonderfully.  If you're a fan of the original album (who isn't?), you need to get this Blu-Ray disc now, play it on a good system, crank it up and it's almost like you're there - awesome, great job guys!",1356566400,,717,4.226277372262774

5322074,5,B009DT9ANW,"Peter Frampton is still the 800 pound gorilla in the room. The guy can run circles around most players and young musicians should take note. He knows how to surround himself with excellent musicians too. The band he has assembled here (Stanley Sheldon - Bass, Rob Arthur - Keys, Adam Lester - Guitar, Danny Wojciechowski - Drums) are all cream of the crop and they mesh together perfectly. A well oiled machine. He even gets is son (Julian Frampton - Vocals) in on the action.

The hi def transfer is sharp and I was particularly impressed with the black levels and contrast. I also appreciated the fact that you feel like your at the show and not watching a music video being constantly jerked around. It's shot the right way by Pierre & Francois Lamoureux.

The DTS Master Audio mix is well done, smooth, warm, tube like, no shrillness here.

All are having fun here and it shows. You will too. Enjoy...",1356480000,,905,4.574074074074074
5322075,5,B009DT9ANW,"I saw Peter in concert back in August, so this was a great way to capture the memory of that show. I think Peter Frampton is one of the best guitarists around and this band is 5 guys just rocking the place for 2+ hours. I would give this DVD a 10 star rating if I could. One thing that I especially appreciate is the video editing and production. As a guitarist, I want to see the licks and chords. Many concert videos show more face shots and crowd shots. This DVD have a great balance of all angles. Great job! I own both the DVD and BluRay versions. The BluRay clarity is stunning. It's like you are on stage with the band.",1356307200,,626,4.097560975609756
5322076,5,B009DT9ANW,"I was able to catch Peter in Mesa, Arizona with two dear friends and acquired a multi-cd set of that nights show from the people who ran his tour for a nominal amount.

This show was a little bit more ""raw"" than the one I was at, but equally amazing. I wish there were more shots of all the things that were shown on the screens behind the band, i.e.,shots of all stages of Peter's career and pictures of his musical idols and friends. The sound of the Bluray and camera work are 1st rate. I recommend you listen and watch on high quality audio and video gear.

The part of the show that I enjoyed the most was, believe it or not, the part after FCA is over and he does a mish mash of his Humble Pie & solo material as well as a spine-tingling version of Soundgarden's ""Black Hole Sun"".

Peter is an incredible musician and in an age where musicians love to entertain us with pyrotechnics and other special effects, Peter chooses to thoroughly and completely entertain us with .... music!  Me comes alive 35, as he calls it, doesn't have a bad track in the entire show.  LOVED it that he added Black Hole Sun instrumental and he brought tears to my eyes with While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  Anyone that is a casual or better fan of Peter MUST get this, 2 1/2 hours of music...so worth the money!",1355875200,3,578,4.4245283018867925

5322084,5,B009DT9ANW,"I've probably seen Peter Frampton perform live six or seven times.  His show in Milwaukee is one of his best.  Try as he might, his first big solo album will always be his career highpoint.  He defined rock improvisation in the 70s' with Humble Pie as well as FCA (the original).

5322089,5,B009DT9ANW,"I was at the NYC Beacon Theatre show... It was-- in a word--  fantastic !  I was in High School when FCA came out, so hearing songs from that album triggers many fond memories for me.
Frampton is given MAJOR props for being a stellar guitarist, and sometimes I think the great songs he has released (the Hits) overshadow his guitar talent.
Listening to what is played on the radio does NOT do this man JUSTICE.... Seeing him LIVE, will blow you away....
He was WAY more than what I expected ... It was a GREAT show and I think this DVD will really reveal the fact that he is undoubtedly one of the most highly under rated guitarists of our time.
If you have been deciding on whether to purchase this DVD, take a leap of faith, I do not think that Peter will disappoint.
I'm looking forward to seeing the show again !!",1353542400,4,817,4.264516129032258
5322090,4,B009DT9ANW,"Saw this show in Portland ME last February. Had always wanted to see Frampton and was more than impressed with his new stuff, especially ""Asleep at the Wheel"". The veteran musicians know that surrounding themselves with good sidemen is a key. He has done that here excellently. If you're a fan you'll enjoy it all, old and new. Audio and video quality are excellent. Thankfully the editors chose not to jump around with multiple shots every fraction of a second. Would recommend this dvd to any aspiring guitar player. Terrific.

Honestly feels like I'm right back in the audience.",1353456000,,581,4.8686868686868685
5322091,5,B009DT9ANW,"This is a very good Blu-ray! Both visually and sound it's spot on.
It was nice to see him reunite with his favorite 1954 black Les Paul classic
after 32 years. This guitar was a gift from Humble Pie days played exclusively Rock On and Rocking the Fillmore albums.
The only thing Frampton has lost is his hair! lol
His band is top notch with a great drummer.
There is a reason why Frampton would make any list of  the top 150 guitarists.
The only offputting thing about this BR is the cheesy cardboard jewell case.
That and the person who rated it as a 2 because there was only one disk in a 2 part DVD.
Honestly what has that got to do with the performance.",1353456000,,657,4.173228346456693
5322092,5,B009DT9ANW,"My how time flys! Seems like yesterday I was watching a much younger Peter Frampton doing his live show at the ""Day on the Green"" concert held at the Oakland Coliseum back in 1976. About the only thing that has changed is the length of his hair. His guitar playing has only improved over the years.

The first part of this concert is a complete run-through of his historic ""Frampton Comes Alive"" album that in essence captapulted Peter into instant super-stardom back in 1976. Many memorable tunes here all done with an energy and love that shows Peter still enjoys playing this stuff. His self-deprecating sense of humor(lack of hair, etc.) shows his personable side and keeps you entertained. The band is solid and the keyboardist really cranks it up a notch on ""Do You Feel Like I Do"".

The second half of the show is, I assume, Peter's more recent works. To put it bluntly, Peter smokes like I've never seen him play before. This guy hasn't missed a beat in all these years and his chops are smokin hot. Lots of extended guitar solos and the band does a great job keepin up with Mr. Frampton. He even has his son Julian come out and sing a couple........VERY touching and he's actually quite the talent himself. It's obvious that Peter is a VERY proud papa.

As far as the video and sound quality goes..... it's top notch, first rate. The audio is especially well mixed, clean and full sounding and nothing seems to overpower or seems missing in this high-def blu-ray mix. Highly recommended.",1353369600,2,1496,4.616541353383458
5322093,5,B009DT9ANW,A must for all Frampton fans.  Best concert mix that really puts you in the audience for a great stroll down a memory lane of 35 years ago.,1353369600,,139,3.9642857142857144
5322094,5,B009DT9ANW,"This is one of the best live concerts on blu ray, both audio and video quality are excellent. The concert alone is 2 hours 46 minutes, with a lot of great guitar playing and jamming. Peter is one of the greatest guitar players-rather than an aging teenage idol. You won't regret it, if you like great guitar playing or rock and roll. At almost 62, Peter still rocks! Marvellous!

One side note: For that 2 stars reviewer-what it does to this blu ray or dvds, or Peter Frampton, if you only received 1 disc instead of 2?",1353283200,,519,4.350515463917525

5322096,5,B009DT9ANW,"If you are a fan of Peter Frampton this is absolutely a 5 star release...
if you aren't then it may not convert you or be 5 stars....but this is why I rate it thus.
1) Its a tremendous value... not only is the first set the entire reproduction of the classic (and in this case that word is not hyperbole) Frampton Comes Alive album...but the performance is terrific , Frampton's guitar playing is wonderful and the sound and picture are first rate!
2) you get basically a second set of almost full concert length of more recent and also high quality songs!
3) there is a terrific 20 minute doc on Frampton's classic Black Les Paul ...(I will not spoil the fun story)
so you have hours of fun and great music for a very light $15 on Blu Ray..

The songs are first rate, the playing is superior, the quality of the production is spot on and instead of a truncated hour plus like so many of these we get 3 hours of music and fun... its just a terrific value and 5 stars for me without question.

If you are a fan who didn't see this tour... get this and you will be sad you didn't ...I am !",1353196800,36,1087,4.122641509433962

8540480,5,B009DT9ANW,"First of all, to see and hear Frampton doing FCA after all these years is an incredible treat; brings back so many memories...thing is, there are so many people - millions, I'm sure - who know nothing of him beyond that single incredible performance.

He's in fantastic form, here, with a sterling band; and their performance literally could not be more evocative of the original.

Great as it is, the real gem here, for me, is the additional concert content from The Beacon Theater in NYC.

Every song is absolutely standout from beginning to end, beginning with Asleep at the Wheel and continuing right through to the encore, a gorgeous rendition of While My Guitar Gently Weeps.

Peter's son Julian makes a vocal appearance on Road to the Sun, and the Humble Pie fave I Don't Need No Doctor, and acquits himself superbly.

Personal favorites Double Nickels, Four Day Creep and Off The Hook (PERFECT!) are fantastic, and he also rips off a pretty special version of Black  Hole Sun.

Another treat is Vaudeville Nanna and the Banjolele, a tune he would never had played back in his heyday.

I really can't say enough about how much I've enjoyed this DVD.

It is stunning, truly stunning.",1486684800,,1189,4.733009708737864
