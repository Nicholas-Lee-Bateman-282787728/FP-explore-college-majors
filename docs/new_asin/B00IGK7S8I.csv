8653874,5,B00IGK7S8I,"As a rider myself, this is a great fun and down to earth DVD of Stevens ride.  It's also refreshing to know that Steven filmed this almost entirely on his own - no TV or filming crew were following him. To me, this means that every situation is a 'real situation' and not a performance just for the purpose of a DVD production. Having visited many of the same areas, Stevens honest and open approach to the people he meets, and to his situations during his travels, is a refreshing change, as is his ability to be honest with himself and the mistakes he makes!  This should definitely be on your DVD shelf.",1497744000,2,606,4.353982300884955
