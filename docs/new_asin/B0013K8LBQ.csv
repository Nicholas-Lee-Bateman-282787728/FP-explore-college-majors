8251564,5,B0013K8LBQ,I had to watch this for my class at school. I take class online so I can't just watch the film I paid and rented this and I actually really liked it. It is not something I would think of to watch or think that I would really like but in the end I really liked it and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning etc.,1473811200,,332,3.757142857142857

The story is very inspirational.

I was very moved when the young man in the film realizes the importance of having pride in his cultural heritage.

The scenery is exquisite.

Batad is a movie that should make all Filipinos proud of their heritage.

Especially Filipinos who have relatives or friends living in the Cordillera.

The english subtitles allows Fil-Ams as well as other non Tagalog speaking people to discover the, cultural significance and heritage to be found in the beautiful mountain provinces and see the world famous rice terraces.",1233187200,3,575,5.129032258064516
