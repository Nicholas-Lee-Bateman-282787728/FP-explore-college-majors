1049627,2,6305538328,i just got my anaglyphic two color version of the bubble i remember first seeing it as a 3d revival back in the eighties in polaroid 3d top bottom system at the forrest hill theator 4 now an alrenco it was really clear but unlike anaglyphic current version they removed the introduction and after 15 minutes the right eye version went to the left and left right causing the images back ground to pop out but the figures go in ward this corrected at th end in that version the mobile was not poping out  but recent dvd it did although color now muddy the begining titles in theator version was clear but dvd anaglyphic vesion the two colors could not block out double eye but ending titles were as spectacular as in polavision version the story could of been better if they didn't put that throwing at the camera gimmick and took some scenes from other 3d movies the can can dance from house of wax which should of been released in 3d on dvd by now the flower scene taken from kiss me kate which also should be in 3d on video by now the moving beer at bar and holloween mask night mare taken from 13 ghost  which by now the illusion o version should of been on dvd too but the story manages to stay intresting in spite of gimick today the idea of portraying a married pregnant women coming from a all night party in film to day would offend the conservative n middle road fashist that is it would be politically in correct against working class family since todays purpose of both indie and studio film makers is to appease the wealthy police millitary christianity and conservative middle road family values against other classes on film so the bubble is positively poltically incorrect at the time this pic was expressing lines more realisticly in some instances talked about issue at the time that most films of 66 was ignoring like discusssion of birth control i missed my pill ect and slang like stop ure bitching was more 70ish most films at that time avoided such discussion except for exploitation films of the time the medium close up and in 3d were good distance shots fair a distance shot does better in polaroid or stereoscopy or a view master than anagly  phics due to two color melding into back ground creating confusion to the mind i'm sure the suttle flicker subsequent field 3d is better but u got that slight flicker so nothings prefect not even poaroid but this version is worth owning,1128124800,3,2404,4.4840182648401825
1049628,1,6305538328,"The 3-d effects on this movie are poor at best. Even adjusting the color on the TV as reccomended does not improve. I normally have no problem viewing 3_D effects, however, this movie only has a select few scenes that actually appear in 3-d. The problem may be in the poor quality of the recording.",1050364800,5,298,4.4363636363636365
1049629,3,6305538328,"ok...you really have to play around with your tv color adjustment to get the right setting for the 3D effects to work. Basically, you need to set it so that the blue portion of the 3D image matches the blue lens of your 3D glasses.
As for the story, well, it was kinda weak, and very similar to the (as stated above) Twilight Zone episode where the couple wakes up, hungover, after a party in a strange town that seems to have no escape. Here, however, the characters get to the outskirts of town to find a clear wall/dome surrounding the city. I don't want to ruin anything here, so I will just say that the conclusion is really a let down, and very unclear at best.
Very cheesy movie, only recommended for those who love 3D movies no matter WHAT the quality or plot.",999129600,8,768,4.303448275862069
1049630,5,6305538328,"There aren't many 3d videos or dvds around, this one is the pick of the crop. It is easily the best 3d movie ever made, one of the few that didn't trivialise the depth effects and eeriness of 3d, but used to enhance an otherwise enthralling film. Technologically, no other 3d movie was ever so seamlessly and flawlessly made. Without the 3d however, this is still a great film, it has such a great creepy, mysterious feeling, and a deliberately paced build-up and denouement.

Second, the running time is just over 90  minutes, not 112. Third, my copy is in a snapper case, not a  keepcase.
Okay, I'll make a few comments. The 3D effect is not very good  - I've always had trouble with these red/blue 3D presentations - but it's a  lot better when viewed on a computer monitor than on a television for some  reason. The movie is interesting but there's not much payoff - they're  trapped in this bubble, we know there's something controlling the people  inside, but it's all situation and not enough conclusion. Probably due to  its era, it reminded me a lot of an episode of LAND OF THE GIANTS.

I looked for this movie for over ten years--this movie is OBSCURE!  with a capital O!

Unfortunately it really falls apart at the end.  The first half isn't bad at all, then it completely loses what little energy it had.  It does have all sorts of problems.  The woman's histrionics are too much to take.  And the movie almost feels like it has scenes missing; it kind of skips forward at times.  Never so you would be confused, but it is jarring.  And the main character frequently contradicts himself or is not consistent.  He is worried the aliens might be watching, so he covers the jeep, then he goes into town and attacks the electric chair.

But the biggest failure of the movie is that it was filled with possibilities that are not explored at all.  It had the potential easily to be 10 times better than it was.

For instance, when Tony and Mark throw a rock at the bubble wall, the reflections and depth are so clear, and the original opening title sequence is so strangely beautiful. But the restoration demo (and the few instances of specks in the restored 3D image) show how the beauty of 3D cinematography is easily destroyed with relatively minor dirt and specks.

It would still be classed as a B grade sci-fi film, but was well worth the watch and was one of the better attempts at bringing a different story line out in 3D. I am glad that many of these original 3D films are being produced in the 3D Blu-Ray format and I really enjoy being able to watch them in this original format. Though many of the B grade story lines in some the early 3D movies were brought out to get the kiddie crowd, this had a more adult theme and was well worth watching.",1435881600,,649,4.2

Long, drawn out, badly edited, continuity is all over the place. Some scenes simply jumped into being where you felt like you missed 10 minutes or so.
Doesn't really qualify as a ""so bad it's good"" film you can watch with friends and make fun of because not a whole lot happens and when it does, it seems repetitive. Also, bubbles Don't Have Lids.

1050369,4,6305538328,"Being a devout fan of 3D movies ever since they first blossomed in 1953, I was anxious to see a few years later that Arch Obler was bringing out a new process called Space Vision.  This placed the right and left frames (on top of each other) on a single frame, eliminating the necessity of running two projectors at the same time and doing away with the nuisance of an intermission.  Somehow I got myself included at a special screening for movie studio bigwigs of the first movie in this process -- ""The Bubble"" (originally titled ""The Fantastic Invasion of Planet Earth."")  We were all amazed.

Now, some 60 odd years later I learned that a copy of that film had been discovered in a rusty old can and was cleaned up and rejuvenated.  For old times sake, I ordered a pristine copy on DVD (they did a fantastic job of restoring the film)  and thoroughly enjoyed it once again.

Arch Obler (who can be called the father of 3D movies since, after all, his ""Bwana Devil"" started the whole thing)  must have thought that if a movie was touted as being in 3D, it ought to show it.  He obviously set up every scene to show depth as the human eye sees it.  Most movies today show a medium close shot with the foreground in sharp focus with the background fuzzy and out of focus.  In Obler's close shots, EVERYTHING is in focus -- you can concentrate on either the foreground or the background, just as one normally sees it.

I would have given this a 5-star rating if the script had only been better.  But hey, you get this for the 3D and 3D is what you get -- in aces!",1432944000,3,1563,4.293515358361775

Other movies have been produced that are in the same league (""Flesh for Frankenstein"" comes to mind, as does ""Comin' At Ya""), but to my knowledge, neither one of those movies has been released on a 3D blu-ray.

Yes it's fun to see the special effects work but after 1 viewing what's left?  Save your money and buy Avatar or Life of Pi. the latter was shot originally in true 3D and the former was transferred through computer work and done brilliantly!

1050626,5,6305538328,"Being a long-time Deborah Walley fan (Gidget, Annette's side-kick in numerous surf movies, etc.), I was thrilled to discover that she starred in an obscure sci-fi movie from the Sixties... in 3-D no less. I've also been a fan of Old Time Radio shows, so Arch Oboler's name was no stranger, either.

Since I don't own a 3-D blu-ray DVD player, or a 3-D television, or special 3-D glasses/goggles, I wanted to determine if this ""new type of 3-D experience"" might actually appear in 3-D on my regular set-up (a blu-ray DVD player and HD television).

I read and re-read the information provided about ""The Bubble"" on Amazon and many of the reviews. None that I could find stated that special equipment was needed.

I also read many reviews outside of Amazon, including a 3-D website that focuses on 3-D films, and none said that 3-D equipment would be needed to watch this film in 3-D. The 3-D website even showed an example of a 3-D effect from ""The Bubble"" which could be seen in 3-D on my computer without any special equipment.

I thought that ""The Bubble"" might be a new type of 3-D DVD that could be played on a regular set-up without the need for 3-D equipment, so I crossed my fingers and ordered ""The Bubble"" from Amazon.

It arrived yesterday and as soon as I read the back of the unopened DVD case the mystery was solved. The case clearly states that in order to view ""The Bubble"" in 3-D a viewer will need a 3-D blu-ray DVD player, a 3-D television, and 3-D glasses or goggles.

So I called Amazon and they were nice enough to let me return it. I mentioned to Amazon that if they had also shown the back of the DVD case for ""The Bubble,"" it would have answered quite a few questions for myself and other 3-D novices out there.

Well, I'm just going to have to be content for a while longer watching Deborah Walley in 2-D do the frug on the beach with the other Southern California teenagers, and surf in front of a blue screen ocean with Annette and Frankie.",1421971200,2,1967,4.402203856749312

Or maybe an old half-hour Twilight Zone episode stretched out to 90 minutes. Might be a tough watch in 2D...but the 3D really makes this quite fun!  Others have mentioned the numerous extensions and they are plentiful--But depth is also strong throughout...more so than on today's major 3D releases such as X-MEN.

Although there are still a few scratches and other film damage, it is leagues beyond what has been seen before.  Lots of cleaning-up has been done.but the real achievement is in the 3D itself.  No crosstalk issues at all, from what I could see. Amazing work from all those concerned and the movie is also in its original aspect ratio as well.  Whether you've seen it on TV or VHS, under the ""Fantastic Invasion"" title or not...however you may have seen it in the past, you've never seen it like this!

Starring a pre-MOD SQUAD Michael Cole and Deborah Walley (GIFGET GOES HAWAIIAN), this goes well with a beer, or wine, or whatever.  One of the BEST examples of aggressive 3D in my collection, that's for sure.

I was busy in Marine Corps boot camp and training at that time. One of the scenes looked like it was filmed at the tunnel that go's to the Griffith Observatory. Movie lot scenes were probably filmed  in Culver City where they filmed Westerns and the TV series Combat. The Bubble reminds be of the TV series Under the Dome.,1418860800,,447,4.1976744186046515

Don't expect much from the script  however....the fun is sporadic with the inclusion of poke em in the face 3D effects such as the ladder from a fire truck, the dance hall girls kicks and a few others.  Afterall these were early days and a get acquainted period  between the audience and 3D

Silly overwrought dialogue and background extras that appear again and again in every outdoor shot.  It's almost perfect!  But all that aside, it's the 3D that pops here. I hate to admit I always loved the schlocky in-yer-face stuff that goes on in these low budget flicks, and this one has plenty.  It is so perfectly tacky that The Bubble looks like a parody of bad 3D movies.  I had to get this because it may be the genesis of my obsession with 3D movies: I remember the trailer for this on TV for the 1976 re-release (as Fantastic Invasion of Planet Earth) and it looked really cool and I had no idea what a 3D movie looked like at the time. I also have the anaglyph 3D DVD version from a few years back but of course nothing compares to Blu-ray 3D.

The picture quality is definitely crisp and clear.  The left/right viewpoints are always aligned vertically, resulting in little or no eyestrain. The extras on the disc are pretty cool and include the alternate opening from 1976 (in 2D or 3D), restoration comparisons (in 2D or 3D), trailers, and script excerpts detailing deleted scenes that that Oboler cut sometime after the premier.

Definitely recommended.  The team behind this did awesome work...perhaps they'll consider doing the same for Andy Worhol's Frankenstein? Pleeeeeeeease?",1418515200,4,1507,4.8062015503875966

It's refreshing to see good 3D, especially when most of the movies coming out in theaters don't have enough depth and many have shunned out of screen effects altogether.  I wish filmakers would use their imaginations more when it comes to 3D.

Special mention to Bob Furmanek and the folks at 3D Film Archive.  Without them this movie would still be decaying in some land fill.

1050863,5,6305538328,"I have a soft spot for this film, which is responsible for starting a life-long passion for 3-D cinema.  I had been fascinated by View Master reels prior, but nothing prepared my ten year old self for the thrill of seeing this on the big screen in the 1976 re-issue under the title ""Fantastic Invasion of Planet Earth"".

A friend had gone to see it, and showed me the polarized glasses he brought home from the theater. He described how ""things really came off the screen at you"" and I didn't rest until I got to see it. I wasn't disappointed; the realism and great depth of the images were mesmerizing and the gimmick shots really did ""come into the audience"".  I was vaguely aware that the film was a decade or so old at that point and that the dialogue was silly (""What's childbirth? Nothing but a sexy bellyache"") and it moved a bit slowly at times, but I didn't care.  I was hooked on 3-D for life.

The film has grown on me each time I've seen it, even in previous presentations, but the new Blu-ray restoration from Kino and the 3-D Film Archive is so good; it made me feel like I was that ten year old again.  Absolutely perfect alignment, extremely deep images, nicely cleaned up video, and best of all, those ""off the screen"" gimmicks still deliver!  This film blows any modern 3-D movie out of the water. If you've been craving ""popout"" as the kids these days seem to insist on calling it, this is the one to get.

I also appreciated the value added material like a wonderful essay by Bob Furmanek on the history of the film's production and distribution, the screenplay excerpts, trailers and a restoration comparison which shows the miracle that Greg Kintz, Technical Director of the 3-D Film Archive, has achieved,  The 3-D transfer here is so good, I really wish the studios and Blu-ray companies would take note and hire the 3-D Film Archive folks to supervise their dimensional discs. A flat version is also included, but I will never bother with that!

1050864,5,6305538328,"Despite being a 3D fan, the theatrical showings of THE BUBBLE completely passed me by so I had no idea what to expect and had some doubts. However I was very pleasantly surprised, finding the film intriguing and entertaining. As has been said, it is very similar to an extended classic Twilight Zone episode and the mysterious and surreal elements of the film are amplified by not revealing too much background information.

But its the 3D which is the selling point of this Blu-ray and it's one of the most spectacular and enjoyable 3D films I've seen. The in-your-face 3D effects were great fun. I always think what's the point of 3D if you can't shove something right in front of the audience to make them flinch! Picture quality is also very good as is the attractive vibrant color.",1417046400,2,786,4.654676258992806
1050865,5,6305538328,"I had never seen THE BUBBLE prior to watching it on this new 3-D Blu-ray -- and what a thrill it was, from beginning to end.

Since many reviews or comments reference THE BUBBLE as being ""like an extended Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode"", let me just say that, in my book, few descriptions can recommend a horror or science fiction title to me any more highly.  I love anything of the sort, and THE BUBBLE did not let me down.

Some have lamented the lack of a more ""explained"" ending.  I understand why they're saying that, but to my knowledge, this is the way writer-director Arch Oboler approached things, and you should not let any such comments deter you from enjoying a delicious hour-and-a-half ride through a lovely vintage 1960s science fiction film.  I was extremely pleased, in fact, to find the script, the acting, and the musical score to be much more sophisticated and satisfying than I'd been led to expect.  I felt that nothing in the proceedings was compromised or dumbed down, and as a result, the film as a whole was more gripping than some of the more widely known and loved '50s and '60s titles that I'm equally crazy about.

But let's get to the heart of the matter -- the primary reason to be thrilled with this release -- the 3-D presentation.

As many people already know, and more are discovering, the classic 3-D films of the 1950s blow most of today's 3-D efforts out of the water in terms of not only filmmaking and storytelling, but in their full use of the 3-D process.  Many of today's are good films in general, but they are also very cautious (even ""timid"" in a few cases) in their approach to taking advantage of what's possible in 3-D presentation.  This is the reason you should sit down and enjoy THE BUBBLE, a 1966 film made in the same spirit as those wonderful 1950s films that were not afraid to fully explore the experience of ""three dimensions"".

And the presentation here is nothing short of miraculous.  THE BUBBLE was filmed in an exceptionally wide (2.50:1) aspect ratio, and the 3-D effects -- both the depth throughout, and the many ""in your face"" moments that are among the most impressive and enjoyable I've seen -- have been painstakingly restored, cleaned, aligned, and lovingly presided over by Bob Furmanek and Greg Kintz of the 3-D Film Archive.

These are the people to thank -- in addition to Kino Lorber itself for believing in the effort and releasing the Blu-ray.

In fact, for my money and in my opinion, these gentlemen are to be commended for doing BETTER in 3-D alignment than the major studios have been in their own expensive efforts at restoring the earlier 3-D films.  Don't get me wrong -- those other efforts are much appreciated, because we want all of the vintage 3-D films to be released.  But here, the alignment and preparation result in a degree of perfection I haven't otherwise experienced.

Bravo, everyone, for a thoroughly enjoyable and impressive release.  I've purchased nearly fifty 3-D Blu-ray titles to date, both vintage and contemporary, and THE BUBBLE immediately takes its place among my top favorites.

Very highly recommended.  More, please!",1416787200,7,3141,4.717948717948718

1050867,5,6305538328,"""The Bubble"" is the work of writer/director Arch Oboler, famous for his ""Lights Out!"" radio plays in the 1930s and '40s. He's the same Arch Oboler responsible for the 1952 3-D film ""Bwana Devil,"" who for the rest of his life was a vocal cheerleader for the artistic and commercial potential of 3-D movies.

Oboler liked communicating his ideas about humanity and our imperfect society using the narrative vehicle of the strange, the bizarre, the unexpected. ""The Bubble"" is this kind of story. Some have compared the film to an extended episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits,"" and there's a ring of truth to that. The events of ""The Bubble"" unfold like a groggy dream, nightmarish not in its intensity but in its unsettling mood and mysterious implications.

The three leads are earnest and appealing. Michael Cole makes a good impression in this, one of his very first screen roles. Crooner Johnny Desmond, as a likable, devil-may-care pilot, might almost be playing himself. And Deborah Walley is absolutely adorable, more than ever.

But the real star of ""The Bubble"" is Space-Vision 3-D. The first truly practical American single-strip 3-D system, Space-Vision delivers strong, deep, beautifully rounded stereoscopic imagery that is nevertheless pleasantly comfortable to view, owing in part to the felicities of the original system design and in part to the remarkable restoration work put forth in this Blu-Ray incarnation by Bob Furmanek and Greg Kintz. If 3-D were a classic Hollywood film actress, you would say she was never lovelier than she is right here.

""The Bubble"" may not appeal to every taste. But if you can slip into its peculiar groove, if you can surrender yourself not just to a story but to visuals and mood and the special delirium of Arch Oboler, then ""The Bubble"" will envelop you on every side.",1416700800,21,1837,4.973941368078176

Yes, it did play like an extended version of the Twilight Zone and a great use of what appeared to be the MGM(?) backlot but still fun. Even some of the cast said it was like a movie backlot. But I found the placement of objects, people, etc was very well planned to give the heightened effect of 3D from the opening shot with the wing of the plane sticking out from the screen. Good too, was the no explanation but hinted at, why the bubble was there. Obviously this would seem to have inspired Under the Dome.... All in all throughly enjoyable fun and certainly well recommended for the beautiful, and restored 3D.

The first queastion is...is this a Frame Sequential 3-D Blu Ray or is it anaglyphic. The second question is if this Blu Ray is anamorphic. The news is good on both questions. This Blu Ray is Frame Sequential 3-D, and it is not anamorphic. I had suspected it was anaglyphic because it didn't say it was frame sequential, and because it says it is anamorphic, and it just couldn't be. I tried to ask Amazon but got no response. For those who don't know, Frame Sequential is the standard type of 3-D found on Blu Ray disks. It requires a 3-D ready Blu Ray player and a 3-D ready HD TV, as well as the LCD glasses. This is better than anaglyphic. With anaglyphic we must have the correctly colored glasses and there are many different color combinations. Anaglyphic is never as good. Anamorphic means that the movie was shot on 35mm film using an anamorphic lens. This squeezes a widescreen image horizontally. During projection the movie is projected through an anamorphic lens and widened back to normal. If this were an anamorphic Blu Ray, there would be no way to expand it back to normal and so people would look incredibly tall and skinny.

I watched the unreleased as yet Blu Ray the other night.  No matter what one thinks of that film, the Space Vision effects are startling.  They are well staged in a very wide screen image and truly unique.  There are a few in-your-face moments (which I love and it's what 3D is supposed to do), but the film actually has a mise-en-scne (Is that correct?? Look at me using French!!) with the 3D composed for a Cinemascope size 2.35:1 image.  It's extremely wide and ultra DEEP.  The actors, props, sets, lighting are all placed by Arch Oboler so that you are looking at an excellent 3D image in every second of the film.  It's not like you are in the real world with three dimensions, but instead you are in some weird 3D world.  It suits the plot of the film perfectly.

This is the Blu Ray to show off your 3D system with!!

I have seen the film a number of times and it really grows on me with each screening.  I can remember thinking that the script was painting itself into a corner and that it would  have a cheat ending, but I didn't find that to be the case at all.  There are some things that are ambiguous to be sure.  I noticed a few tiny discrepancies and a continuity error or two to be honest.  Nothing major.

However I found the reveal to be completely satisfying.  It left me wanting to see what happens next.

With the print that the 3D Archive was working from (see the article)  it's astounding what they have done with it.  There is one scene in the film that may be the very best 3D effect I have ever seen!  Others have said this as well from what I understand.  You will know which one it is if you see it!  I guarantee it.

They are also including the lost footage from the shooting script in pdf form.  I think some of the questions one is left with are explained in the script.  A good move since it will give some closure to us fans wanting more info.

This movie made use of a double lens system for both camera and projector as opposed to the prior two-camera, two-projector system. A major innovation at the time. Technical innovation, however, can't save a weak movie.

Obler was primarily a writer and it shows in this movie: lots of words, little action. The plot is basically good. I would like to see it remade with stronger actors, some CGI and a good director.

As for the DVD itself, the 3-D doesn't translate well to DVD. I went to the premier of this move and the 3-D was very good. It just doesn't come across on the DVD. Still, if you're a fan of B movies, or 3-D, or just weird (and somewhat historic) stuff, this is the movie for you.

We don't see the victims finally escape to freedom, but just some optimistic tone that the nightmare is ending and everything going back to normal, and then it ends suddenly with everyone smiling, even though they still have not exited from ""The Bubble"" to the real world (assuming the real world is still out there). Very good philosophical part, about the real world also having some of the same weird phenomena, though we just take these for granted -- So these goofy ""Bubble"" characters who are like zombies/puppets are not so different from the real world where we ourselves are like puppets being controlled by some unknown Force manipulating us, programming us for who knows what kind of purpose, within this ""Bubble"" we call the real world. The show is enjoyable even without the 3D effects -- some obvious 3D scenes can't be appreciated if you don't have the glasses (you see some blurs). But the video is OK (a D+ or C- without the glasses), worth watching anyway.",1518134400,,1442,4.962809917355372

7891857,4,6305538328,"After this movie began I remember seeing it as a young'un.  But don't remember ever seeing it in 3D.  And what 3D it is.  Incredible how objects not only position themselves off the screen but at times seem to come right across the room almost into your lap.  This shows 3D as it's supposed to be but which a lot of modern 3D movies fail to deliver.  A sort of right-in-your-face experience.  If you're a fan of 3D, get it.  It's dated of course with a sort of Twilight Zone feeling to the storyline but it's still worth adding to your collection.",1493683200,2,547,4.303921568627451
