8695720,2,B00RPOPWO8,I was so pleased to finally own a copy of this classic that I will not complain that the audio lipsync slips until after an hour the audio and video are out of sync by three seconds.,1484956800,,182,3.945945945945946
8695721,1,B00RPOPWO8,"Do not buy the $5.99 version of this film.  The sound jumped mid way through and even though there were subtitles, the words never again connected with the lips of the characters.  Go for the more expensive versions.",1480809600,,216,4.657894736842105
8695722,2,B00RPOPWO8,"I was thrilled to find this title, since I'd long known the Hollywood remake, ALGIERS, and wanted to see Jean Gabin in the original.  And I was enjoying watching it for a brief time, until the audio started to slip out of sync with the video.  It got progressively worse, until it became a joke.  One character's mouth would be moving while another character's dialogue was sounding.  I contacted the manufacturer, to find out whether this was a particularly bad copy, or if this is the way they distributed the product.  I never heard back from them.  Bottom line:  save your money until and unless a better version is released.",1454716800,,629,4.663636363636364
8695723,5,B00RPOPWO8,"Classic French Gangster film of the pre-WWII era. This is the movie upon ""Algeirs,"" with Charles Boyer, was based.",1435276800,,114,5.052631578947368
8695724,2,B00RPOPWO8,"If your looking for a review of the movie itself , I suggest reading the criterion collection.  Personally, I love this movie.
However, trying to save money I gave this DVD-R recording a try and was disappointed.  I thought they did a decent job
with the visual transfer-  clear, maybe a bit too light gray ,ocassionally  hazy,  but overall  okay.
The dubbing/ sound is an other story... clear to the ear, but terribly  out of sync with the movement and dialouge of the scene...In other words,
there's an egregious 2 to 3 second delay.  This was troublesome . It did hamper my enjoyment and I would not recommend it.",1428883200,3,616,4.587155963302752
