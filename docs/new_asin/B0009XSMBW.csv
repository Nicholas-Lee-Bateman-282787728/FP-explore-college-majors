8069924,4,B0009XSMBW,"There is little in R Olsavicky's learned review with which I disagree.  The television productions values here are not ideal, although the stage is the size of the Melbourne Cricket Ground so you have to cut some slack to the early-1990s cameramen.  I also agree that the sound disappoints; there is a fine orchestra in the pit and we don't hear enough of it.

The high point of the DVD is the cast.  A very young Rene Pape brings warmth if not vocal dominance to Sarastro; Deon van der Walt is excellent as Tamino -- perhaps his career-defining role; Luciana Serra (Queen of the Night) nails both of her notoriously difficult arias; Anton Scharinger is a lively ham-acting Papageno. Ruth Ziesak gets a pass mark from me for her Pamina. You get the bonus quirk of Georg Solti playing the glockenspiel, hamming it up with Scharinger .

Overall I give it four stars on value for money.  I picked this up from my surprisingly high-brow local record store for AU$24.95 and I'm feeling pretty happy about that as an investment for over three hours of quality Mozart opera. For that price you normally have to put up with the second-tier Opus Arte productions.",1435449600,,1154,4.6600985221674875

8069926,5,B0009XSMBW,"I've watched and listened to at least 15 different presentations of Mozart's  'Magic Flute', some of them live, others on DVD, and one of them with marionettes, and although it seems to be fashionable to mock Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's productions nowadays, his 1982 Salzburg Festival 'Flute gave me many new insights into Mozart's characters.  I was especially intrigued by Christian Boesch's portrayal of the bird-catcher, Papageno.  All of Papageno's spoken dialogue was left in, and I learned for the first time that his mother was probably one of the Queen of the Night's attendants.  Henceforth, every time the Three Ladies appeared on stage, I wondered which one of them might have given birth to the bird-man.

Again, in Act II, scene 4 after Pamina's desolate ""Ach, ich fhl's"" where in some productions Papageno seems to be mocking Tamino (""See, I can keep quiet, too...""), here he sympathizes with the somewhat humorless, didactic prince.  This really deepened Papageno's character for me.

Mr. Ponnelle's normally lavish sets seemed somewhat constricted by his stage--the stony, galleried background of the Felsenreitschule.  However, the galleries made a great frame for Edita Gruberova's Queen of the Night, and effectively distanced her from her daughter, when she is urging Pamina to kill Sarastro.  It performed the same service for the three Genii when they first appeared to Tamino, and again to Papageno and Tamino in the trial scene.

Incidentally, the three Genii were sung by soloists from the Tlzer Knabenchor, and they were absolutely the best I've ever heard in any production.  Such could not be said for some of the other singers.  Peter Schreier's Tamino started out tight and dry, although he improved as the opera progressed.  Edita Gruberova also had trouble with her tough vocal gymnastics in the first act, but opened up full throttle when haranguing her hapless daughter in Act II.  ""Der Hlle Rache"" was well worth waiting for.  Finnish bass, Martti Talvela was an imposing Sarastro, although at times his voice was so soft it was drowned out by the orchestra.  Ileana Cotrubas was a wistful, beautifully-sung Pamina.

The Vienna Philharmonic was superbly conducted by a youthful James Levine, who was actually given a line of spoken dialogue in this production ( ""Zurck!"")  when Papageno showed up in the orchestra pit, searching for his lost Papagena.  I think Mozart would have loved that playful little interlude.  Thank you, Mr. Ponnelle.",1424908800,2,2473,5.181360201511335
8069927,5,B0009XSMBW,"This version matches the recording I have of the complete opera and was recorded at the Salzburg Festival in the 80's. It was the first time that ""Magic Flute"" or ""Die Zauberflote"" had been recorded for broadcast on TV and was originally show on Great Performances on PBS. While there have been numerous versions, this one preserves the feeling of attending the opera, not just a film.

The story is pretty basic. A young prince must rescue a young princess from having been kidnapped. To aid him, he is given a magical flute, a very reluctant companion and is aided by a trio of young guides who appear in time to give words of wisdom. The prince and princess fall in love and well... I'll let you watch it to find out how it ends.

This is one of the few operas by Mozart featured in the movie ""Amadeus"" and that is where I fell in love with it.",1416355200,3,847,4.320754716981132
8069928,3,B0009XSMBW,"This is not an easy review.  There are some real issues with this performance and especially with the DVD quality!  I expect more in quality from DECCA.
1) I am very disappointed with the Video part of this production.  The picture just fills only 3/4 of my HD screen.  Definition is very poor with many blurring problems.  When singers in bright costumes move too fast a ghostly blur follows them.  Lighting is far too dark at times and one can barely see the singers at times.  This is picturewise a less than good video recording. In fact I have some private DVDS with much better picture and sound production.
2) The Sound Quality is not that great either.  It's muffled or muted much of the time.  The excellent Weiner Philharmoniker is too much in the background.
3) The Sets are okay; just not inspired.  Set changes often are way too long and the viewer sits in his/her living room in total darkness and wonders if the DVD is having problems or has stopped.  These long pauses are very distracting and should have been edited out.
4) The stage directing is very weak and at times none exsistent.  Too many times a character enters and just ""parks and barks.""  Tamino often runs in turns and sings with no motivation.  The poor Queen in both arias gets no help from the director.  In the first her costume sabotages her...her qown is the set.  In the second she just stands there and sings to the Conductor.  Luciana Serra deserved better than this.  The three ladies just do traffic patterns for no apparent reason and with nonexistant motivation.
5) Some of the costumes just work, some work(the priests) and some are outright disasters.  Tamino's and Pamina's are very bad.  My Grandmother has better ""house dresses"" than Tamino's feminine rags.
6) Make up and hair styles are not always flattering i.e. Pamina's braid and Tamino's red marks on his forehead.
7) Most of the singers are really fine; especially, a very young Rene Pape and Deon Van Der Walt.  Luciana Serra's very bright voice works well for The Queen Of The Night.  Ruth Ziesak is a weak Pamina.  Her top just doesn't float and she does squeeze at times.  Anton Scharinger is just adequate as Papageno.  The three ladies are only Okay.  The three boys are very good.
8) Solti's conducting is fine; I just like Muti so much more in 2006 at Salzburg.
IN CONCLUSION: This DVD has some weak production values that DECCA should have addressed or left in the Vault.  It isn't worth the money I spent on it and does neither DECCA or THE SALZBURG FESTIVAL JUSTICE.  I don't expect to view this again.",1356566400,7,2568,4.6092715231788075
8069929,5,B0009XSMBW,"I really love this opera and have been trying to find another than the Met's. I found this one and inspite the sound has not been remastered, I bought it and really enjoyed. A DREAM cast, specially Cotrubas and Gruberova at their best, but also the rest. Beautiful sets and lightning, specially for the queen of the night arias. There are many other productions but this is the one to buy, mostly because of the singing and the historic value.",1189900800,5,443,4.55
8069930,1,B0009XSMBW,"The magic flute is probably the most overrated opera written by Mozart among his compositions. Don't get me wrong.. I am truly a mozartian and looking forward to having this DVD. I mean after watching this salzberg production, you will agree with my opinion at least. Musically, it's a masterpiece of course, however, the problem is Shnittke's libretto and the production itself obioulsy. It's very dark and I can not see what are singers doing on the stage. The performance feels empty and there is a terrible direction and meaningless, disastrous stage design all over the place. The entire casts look so old (especially Schreier and Cotrubas) and act horribly. I think it's hard to ruin this opera like this with such a marvelous music by Mozart. Very bad casting, acting and directing. Total disaster.",1128124800,14,805,4.970370370370371
8069931,5,B0009XSMBW,A wonderful performance of a great opera. Edita Gruberova is the Queen of the Night. Her singing is a virtuoso display of coloratura artistry without equal. After repeated viewings I still find myself amazed by her vocal abilities. A must buy for fans of Mozart and Gruberova.,1127606400,15,276,4.8936170212765955
