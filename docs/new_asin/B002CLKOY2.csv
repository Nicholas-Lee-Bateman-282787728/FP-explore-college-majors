3906701,4,B002CLKOY2,"Very interesting video, but I could not understand or identify with these people despite my best efforts. Bought the video for my nephew who is very reserved and I can't reach. Think perhaps this video is for his demographic.",1385856000,,225,4.794871794871795
3906702,4,B002CLKOY2,"I work as a prison volunteer, facilitating groups practicing zen meditation. We showed this film at one of our weekly sessions. It is refreshing to be able to bring a positive, contemplative voice that knows firsthand about street life, drug use, crime and incarceration. Good stuff.",1383868800,9,283,5.173913043478261
3906703,4,B002CLKOY2,"I am a fan of Noah Levine.  I have read two of his books and frequent his website for updates.  I am doing an educational class in a treatment center that incorporates Eastern Philosophy into recovery for addicts and alcoholics.  I was hoping this video would provide the group with some education while showing an alternative recovery lifestyle.  While it did some of this, it was more entertaining than educational.  I am still a fan of Noah but this was more entertaining than educational.  I would not have paid full price for this item if I had known this ahead of time.  If you simply want to know about Noah, his personality, his friends, and some of the dharma punx philosophy, this would be a great introduction before reading his books.",1374192000,5,746,4.648854961832061
3906704,5,B002CLKOY2,"I love this movie.  There's no sugar coating in this documentary.  It's the tale of a young man with a conflicted mind that led him down a self-destructive path.  Luckily, his family had a background in Buddhism that he called upon in his darkest hour.  His journey is so uplifting.  Believe me, what he did is not a miracle - it's hard work.  Noah stopped just short of suicide to finally ask for help.  And luckily for him, he knew where he could find it.  Now he's there, as a beacon to others of his generation, to make sure THEY can find help too.  I hope young people from all walks of life are exposed to this story, because this young man was able to stay true to his rebellious spirit, and the life he loved, while discovering a deep understanding of the human condition and the compassion in his soul.  So, he's giving back.  He went from bad news to good news.  That's awesome.  This movie is a great resource for mothers of troubled teens.",1354406400,6,951,4.3352272727272725
3906705,1,B002CLKOY2,"Very shallow treatment of the otherwise fascinating question of how one comes to an awareness of the Dharma.
My life was messed up.
I turned Buddhist.
My life is good now.
Buy my books.
Evangelicals are so predictable.
There seems to be a whole sub-genre of recent Buddhist writing, appealing to the disaffected postmodern twenty something seekers. Born-again Buddhist authors such as Noah Levine, Brad Warner, and Dinty W. Moore have established a certain brand of Buddhist minimalism designed to allow people to graze on enough spirituality and contemplation to reassert their belief in their own goodness. It's hard to take seriously, or with any depth any writing that begins quite so many sentences with the phrase ""Buddhism is just..."" something or other. Perhaps it's time we reassert that ""Buddhism is more than..."" that same something or other.",1349136000,8,853,5.188405797101449
3906706,5,B002CLKOY2,"By now, most of us have heard the name Noah Levine. You've probably even read one, or both, of his books ""Dharma Punx"" and ""Against The Stream"". You may have even been to a retreat he has run or meditate regularly at his Against The Stream Buddhist Meditation Society (at least those on the West Coast might).

""Meditate and Destroy"" is the brainchild of Sarah Fisher, Blue Lotus Films. The documentary follows Noah through various forms of media using some cool footage recorded directly from the online community of Second Life), telling his story of growing up a drunken and drug addled street punk, to his many times in juvenile hall/ incarceration and his growth in learning from those experiences now. If you've read the books he's written, you pretty much know the story that is told, but ""Meditate and Destroy"" speaks a bit more intimately, as you actually hear and see Noah telling the story.

There are cut-ins with his mother, father, his various teachers and his childhood friends who knew him best. Sarah follows him to some of the teachings he has held on his book tours, and even teachings he gave at the same juvenile hall he was locked up in a youth.

Since Noah's books have been published he has amassed a mere army of Dharma Punx, many of which are interviewed in the documentary about their experiences with Noah as a teacher. As daunting as that sounds, the charge of this army is compassion, kindness and genuine consideration for the lives of all beings. The amazing thing is, he is not only breaking down barriers within the Buddhist world with his alternative approach to Dharma, but I think is helping to break down barriers in the world in general. Who would of thought a man, coming from where he has, with as many tattoos and gold capped teeth could be so full of wisdom and genuine loving-kindness? As soon as you meet and talk to him, the ""masked"" man in front of you vanishes and you realize that this man is the real deal, as real and true as it gets.

Noah's story is so real you can't help but get charged up, and come to the realization that anyone can change, even ourselves. You don't have to be some quiet, timid monk with robes. I'm sure some people could be put off by a ""tattooed Buddha"" but what other form do you think a Buddha could take. Buddha taught that we all have Buddha nature, so why not some in your face, tattooed guy who doesn't candy coat the truth? I know that without him having written these books I may not have pursued the path as stringently.

The DVD has come cool extras, including some of his teachings. So, even if you've read the book, I would still recommend viewing this documentary.",1286150400,3,2654,4.532359081419624
3906707,4,B002CLKOY2,"This powerful, moving documentary traces Noah Levine's harrowing journey from wasted youth to deeply spiritual man. As detailed in his autobiography Dharma Punx, Noah found the strength to overcome a perilously troubled adolescence marred by multiple incarcerations. The film brilliantly explores his transformation, combining interviews with his parents, friends, followers and teachers with footage of both his dissolute punk days as well as his serene adult life. The film does the power of his story justice, encompassing both the grisly details of his nadir as well as the intensity of his dedication to the Buddhist practice. MEDITATE AND DESTROY draws great strength from Noah's narration, as he draws us in with palpable wisdom, honesty, and compassion. This is a real story: invigorating, engrossing, and inspiring.",1268784000,4,824,5.6
3906708,3,B002CLKOY2,"It is exciting to see a Buddhist documentary like ""Meditate and Destroy"" come along. Buddhism films are few and far between.
Noah Levine's book, ""Dharma Punx"" is a fine book. I wanted to know how Dharma Punx is introducing people to Buddhism. How is the movement spreading across the U.S.? What is it's impact? This documentary just scratches the surface.
The film is 70% autobiography of Levine. Only about 30% shows how he is helping people discover Buddhism, and creating a modern image of the dharma.
The film spends too much time on his past drug abuse, street running and lawlessness. It comes to a peak with a video-game style scene of him ""hitting bottom"" in a jail cell. It was over-the-top and by far the low-point of the movie.
On the positive side, seeeing people he has touched in his community was very cool. His message resonates with the 12-step (Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous) folks, and we clearly see that here. I liked watching him teach on a meditation pillow without much Buddhist ""trappings"".
I also liked when he interviewed tattoo-clad young people about how they came to follow Buddhism. Good stuff.
I want to see more about these 30-something authors and teachers (my age group) who are stripping away the safron-robe image to make Buddhism more relatable in the West.
Maybe in the next movie.",1264464000,19,1332,4.872246696035242
3906709,5,B002CLKOY2,"Meditate and Destroy is an eye opening documentary about Noah Levine's amazing life story. Growing up in Santa Cruz, Noah spent his early adulthood trying to figure out his purpose in life through addiction. Given a second chance, he found his true purpose which is teaching Buddhism. Excellently captured by Director Sarah Fisher, Meditate and Destroy is an amazing story that will make you reflect on your own life's path.",1260230400,3,424,5.071428571428571
3906710,5,B002CLKOY2,"Director Fisher does a great job of capturing the essence of Noah Levine's story -- bringing us through his struggles and demonstrating the quiet strength and solace in the meditative life. This is not your father's Buddhist story. Noah's had a rough and tough life, yet shows the possibilities for potential. You definitely get a feel for the guy and my only wish is that more people would follow in his footsteps into the way of peace and reconciliation.",1260057600,2,456,4.784810126582278

3906712,5,B002CLKOY2,"While the film is marketed to Punks, it really does agree with any free-thinker or rebellious person. Though not punk, I grew up being somewhat subversive due to my circumstances and environment. I have remained that way and struggled with religion for most of my life. This film, despite its age, is a timeless message that what we seek is within us. Always.",1447286400,,359,4.714285714285714

3906716,3,B002CLKOY2,"Old Noah is certainly self-absorbed for a Buddhist, like a punk rock Richard Gere. Never seeing over the lip of his own egotistical egolessness, neither can  see that trying to bring rock swagger (or GIGOLO narcissism) past the gates of Samsara into timeless Nirvana islike passing your camel's hump through the eye of the needle, if I might mix religious metaphors. I'm glad Noah's sober but oh brother. I'm not saying it's easy; in just writing this review I'm more guilty of it than he is. But then again I don't run around like the Buddha's own chosen Bad Boy... at least not anymore.

If you want something that really keeps it real in the area of prison, ego dissolution, Buddhism, drug and alcohol recovery - seek out THE DHARMA BROTHERS, now THOSE guys are inspiring, and also humble in a quiet way that makes you want to drop your worldly possessions and follow them deep into the wilderness, barefoot, over cracked glass sand... I'm allowed to say that, since I'm not them. `I read a paragraph of one of his books or hear him talk for a few minutes, and I just want to challenge Levine to a 'humble-off' - and that can't be the 'next right action.'",1439251200,,1158,4.535885167464115

3906720,4,B002CLKOY2,"I'm a big Noah Levine fan. Until I found against the stream I kept feeling very confused about Buddhism, but now I have a basic understanding and belong to a temple. I watched this documentary because I'm such a fan of Noah's teaching methods.. It was interesting hearing his story. He spent time with a rough crowd, and engaged in violent  activities and harmed  himself through substance abuse, but through his practice emerged a peaceful and productive member of society. I don't enjoy the punk music played throughout..I hated that, but I put up with it to hear about his journey. Not for anything, if he was a little thinner, Noah could totally be one of people magazine's sexiest men. Don't mind me I'm married to an emotionally intelligent rebel so I guess I have a thing for this type. I digress. The Bottom line is:  if you want to learn Buddhism from a down to earth teacher, and you aren't afraid of some laughs and profanity, he's your guy. If you want to know his journey and how he became such a great teacher watch this documentary.",1390003200,,1047,4.558510638297872

8364264,2,B002CLKOY2,Way too much coverage about a troubled past with very little about basic Buddhist teaching.  Noah smokes cigarettes while sharing the dharma. So he violates the precept of not harming self or others with his second hand smoke. Sad and boring.,1461888000,,242,4.902439024390244
