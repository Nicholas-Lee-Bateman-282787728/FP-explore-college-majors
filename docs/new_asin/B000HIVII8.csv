It takes scenes like the ones in this DVD to appreciate the majesty of the Dolomites. This admirable work must have taken years of planning, strategic positioning, time lapse footage and editing. The Dolomites enchant with their beauty, mystery and surprise and these elements are captured with skill and grace. Since my first visit a few years ago, I have become their captive and have spent many days exploring and hiking and can't wait to return. Thank you for producing such a masterpiece! The Dolomites and the clouds dance to Mozart's Requiem! Spectacular!",1282608000,,667,4.964285714285714

8139848,5,B000HIVII8,"After seeing this movie, I ordered it straightway for my brother.  The movie plays Mozart's Requiem Mass to video footage of clouds emerging around the tips of the Alps with sun, moon, and stars circling overhead.  This movie is great for those who appreciate nature and classical music.  Note: if buying as a gift be aware that this Requiem is more intense than relaxing.",1229385600,,372,4.78125

8139850,5,B000HIVII8,"I fell in love with the Dolomites when I first saw them forty years ago. I have picture books about them, watch online videos about them, fantasize about them, and best of all, bicycle and hike there frequently. But this DVD shows us these unique, spectacular peaks in a way no one has ever seen them: time lapse video of the changing skies, sunlight, shadows, weather, colors, stars. And if that's not enough, all set to the music of Mozart. The viewer is transported into a magical realm. This is a video I'll watch again and again and I recommend it to all who love mountains and want to see something uplifting.",1209772800,,615,4.5
