8051410,5,B0007THED0,"This is an incredible video recording of a live to digital recording session featuring Guido Basso, Joey DeFrancesco, and Guido Basso's regular combo mates.  Each musician chooses one tune and the session continues until all have been played.  The repartee over the mixing board is wonderful but the playing is absolutely superb!  I would give this my highest possible recommendation.",1435968000,,384,5.366666666666666
8051411,5,B0007THED0,"I was looking forward to seeing this (having heard these tracks a while back), but was unprepared for just how good the 5.1 sound mix was. The visuals are good, although sometimes focusing a bit too much on a musician's face rather than their fingers or their instrument. This is my new DVD (as opposed to Blu-ray) reference for a 5.1 sound mix. Superb!",1345334400,,353,4.53125
8051412,4,B0007THED0,"I love this DVD! Turn the lights down low, grab a great glass of red and your best gal and settle in.",1252713600,,101,3.6363636363636362
