3853198,4,B0026AZULQ,"I saw this film as a child with my father.  It seemed it took forever for DVD release.  Upon viewing again for the first time as an adult I was duly impressed with Stewart's acting,  Not really a character he would portray which I think made it all the more enjoyable.  I am aware that some liberties were taken in contrast to Mr. Williams' actual life.  That's Hollywood at the time.  Overall a great performance and a Class A film.  Solid Biopic.",1257206400,3,448,4.390243902439025
3853199,3,B0026AZULQ,"...considering the soundtrack on this DVD is worse than any broadcast of the film on TCM I've ever seen. Maybe it was just my particular disc, but this product really disappointed. The video quality was excellent, but what does that matter if you have unconstrained noise on the audio? Do note that this is an unrestored DVD-R of this film issued by Warner Brothers with absolutely no extras and no chapter stops. You can only go forwards and backwards in ten minute increments.

As for the movie itself, it is an excellent and unusual film starring James Stewart as a moonshiner serving a thirty year sentence for the death of a federal officer who raided his still. Williams is quite bitter as he really doesn't understand why and how he landed in prison, and doesn't feel like his fate is just. He and the warden of the prison (Wendell Corey) soon wind up in a semi-adversarial relationship, with the warden seeing that Williams is an exceptional individual, but still needing to rein him in for the purpose of maintaining order at the prison. In time the trust between the two grows as the warden really sticks his neck out and allows Williams to work on building an experimental rifle in the prison metal shop.

I highly recommend this film, but as a disappointed customer I advise you steer clear of this product.",1249689600,6,1319,4.681034482758621

As I understand it, the rifle used in the movie was the actual rifle he invented.  A great story of how a gun got him into prison and another gun got him out, the CORRECT way.

3853201,4,B0026AZULQ,"This is one of those classic movies not to be missed. If you enjoyed ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" with the fine performance by Burt Lancaster, you will definitely want to see James Stewart in ""Carbine Williams"". It floors me this isn't on DVD yet. I see so much trash come out on DVD everyday and yet classics like ""African Queen"", and others like this gem of a movie are overlooked.

Synopsis: An ornery moonshiner is partially responsible for the killing of an agent on a raid of his still. He goes to prison and over the years develops a respect for the law and his country. He designs a carbine automatic rifle while in prison and it is tested and then used by the US military. Don't miss this movie if you can catch it. I highly recommend it for the whole family.",1172707200,18,761,4.359154929577465
3853202,5,B0026AZULQ,"David Marshall ""Marsh"" ""Carbine"" Williams was my great Grandfather. He passed in 1975. He never made moonshine in the NC mountians, as you say. He lived in the eastern part of NC.This is where he practiced his craft and was arrested.

In difference with the 1st reviewer again; He most definiatly would hurt a fly. He was a mean cuss who often booby trapped his top secret work shop door with loaded guns. He could and did whip most men who challenged him in any fashion and hence had earned a lot of respect or fear from those who knew him. A ""G man"" was killed on a raid on HIS still. He took the blame because it was the right thing to do. He was a true mechanical genius. He overcame a tremendous amount of tourture by the warden as was the custom with willful prisioners. James Stewart did a great job in the movie. ""Marsh"" was on the set making sure of it. Want to know the real story? Read the book written about him. He approved it and proof read it.

My name is Tom Williams and these are the facts.",1170633600,86,1008,4.190721649484536

3853225,4,B0026AZULQ,"Bottom Line First:
Carbine Williams, DVD version, tells an interesting story. James Stewart as the country convict turned gun designer is nuanced enough to suggest a major effort to tell something like the truth. Acting is low key and the timing is slow compared to what we have become accustomed. A better than average movie. The appeal may be to one of several audiences rather than something for everyone.

The story line: the son of a very important designer at Remington Arms is old enough to hear the rumors about this dads criminal history. David Marshal Carbine Williams (James Stewart) decides that any version of the facts he might tell might be too biased for the boy. Instead he takes him to his old prison warden and friend, Capt. Peoples (Wendell Cory) who is to tell him the complete truth. We see the narrative as a biography of the real man. Perhaps the fact that this is the story as it might have been told to a young boy is a reminder that the audience should remember that this is a Hollywood version.

Given James Stewart's earlier reputation had been for playing Aww shucks kind of mild roles, this movies is successful as presenting Stewart with a harder edged role. This Carbine Williams is a man with a lot of reasons why his version of the world is correct, especially as he will stick to it with force if available or stubbornness if not. We seems to respect this kind of simple arrogance in a person who achieves good things and despise if used to commit evil.

It is never made clear exactly how Williams made the leap from backyard mechanic to trained designer. I suspect his years in the Navy account for that but this time is glossed over. Instead we have the incidental problem of a barely educated man form back of nowhere who can make proper engineering drawings.

Much of the movie is formulaic. The Good hearted country people who are his loving family and loyal wife. Indeed it is his desire to spare them the reminders of him being in prison that becomes the bases for the struggle between the warden and Williams. Most of the scenes of the casual violence of hard times in a State Prison are toned down there is still an apology at the end, indicating that by 1952 this abuse was was no more. Perhaps.

What is not so formulaic is the portrayal of Williams. He does not play a great man. He is not overcoming official indifference or corporate schemes. He is an uneducated, unsophisticated character, but one driven to invent. This portrayal has a depth not expected in the biopics of the 1950s. The director threads a path between clichs, condemning a system that held a good man in hard time and making a hero out of a murderer. The audience is asked to respect a man who turns out well, but may not have ever been an easy man to know. The child, his son decides to respect him.

Fans of Jimmy Stewart should enjoy his performance. Folks with a casual interest in the unusual history of a very important weapon may like this movie. Objections may come from those who hate anything gun related. As entertainment it tends to drag. It is not a typical date night movie, nor can it compete with those seeking an action movie. For most this may be a rent/watch once rather than own forever kind of movie.",1452902400,4,3242,4.523890784982935

David Marsh Williams returned from the Navy and planned to marry his childhood sweetheart Maggie. He is one of eight sons. He gets a job with the railroad and hopes to earn more money. A coworker offers him a chance to earn more money operating a boiler. Moonshining is against the law. March plans to buy a farm. Federal agents killed a moonshiner who resisted arrest. There is an accident, Marsh is scalded. Maggie finds out and tells him to quit. He continues this work. Federal agents raid his still. Alive or dead? They escape arrest. But a Federal agent was killed! He surrenders and is tried and convicted. He violated the 18th Amendment. At age ten he made his first gun out of wood. There is a plea deal to a reduced charge.

But a new judge sentenced him to 30 years at hard labor. A burst appendix sends him to the hospital. A stoolie is knifed, a shiv is found on Marsh. He is sent to the chain gang. Violators are whipped. Marsh went to prison farm. One day he fixes the gun of the Captain, who orders him to write his folks. One day he kills a rattlesnake! Later he is sent to ""the hole"" (solitary confinement) for a month! He is given 24 hours furlough. He is reassigned to the blacksmith shop, and designs a new kind of a gun. He secretly works on his idea until it is discovered. In time the story leaks. His gun is five pounds lighter, it would allow a soldier to carry more ammunition. His short-stroke piston is a valuable invention. He received a full pardon. The M-1 carbine was used in WW II.
