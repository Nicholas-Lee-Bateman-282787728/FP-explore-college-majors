2114542,5,B0002PYSB0,"Greg The Bunny.

A show thats sadly remembered for flaming out on Fox TV in the summer of 2002. In reality,  it wasn't so much that it wasn't up to par as was the network didn't set it up for success. Fox TV put it after Bernie Mac on Wednesday nights at first. Bernie Mac's demo was not going to stick around and watch GTB. Secondly, only after three weeks of reasonable promotion FOX seemed to write the show off jerking it off for sweeps then finally bringing it back for two weeks to disappear again lastly in ""burn off"" mode on Sundays at 7:30p for August of 2002.

Its a story of a show that screams it wasn't given a proper shot.

The show itself was brillant in a offkilter way. If you bought into the premise that puppets and people in some strange universe could share the world - it worked. If you couldn't buy into the premise - you hated the show.

Everything revolved around Greg a rabbit handpuppet with button eyes (later creepy glass eyes - FOX exec ""suggestion"") and his quest to find employment. On a visit to his roomates father's job - a director for fictional kids show ""Sweetknuckle Junction"" Greg mistakenly ends up auditioning for the program. Insanity and hilariousness ensue. Greg gets the job and the whole premise is set up. The sweetknuckle junction cast is much more jaded and prone to outrageousness than one would've expected.

The show parodied TV itself, TV execs,  Childrens TV, actors, puppet love and even dared to spoof some of the sacred cows of our culture - race relations etc.

My personal favorite episode was ""Surprise!"" Where the cast has to lead a TV Guide reporter around trying to impress her to make Sara Silverman's character happy. Naturally, the cast are being artifical and just plain sucking up to sell the wholesome image they were told to sell. It all leads to Junction Jack's house after its found out it was his birthday and the cast throw a improptu, again to look good for the TV Guide reporter, surprise party at his house. Only it turns out, that Jack the rugged train conductor character prefers a dress and heels occasionally!  Jimmy and Greg fighting over who can shmooze the TV Guide reporter thats actually a Lesbian that takes Sarah Silverman home is hilarious too!

In the final analysis, this show wasn't for everyone As a previous reviewer articulated. FOX targeted GTB to teens and to be honest this was not a teen show. There was alot of subtle and adult humor to be had that honestly a teen wouldn't get. It was more matched for its wicked satire to be a heir to the Simpsons throne.

Only if FOX had been smarter in the show's execution and patient they could've had a long running hit. You could've seen stuffed Gregs and Tardys on suction cups looking out car windows.

Alas, though - FOX didn't have the patience for that vision to bare fruit.",1091664000,68,2822,4.544378698224852
2114543,5,B0002PYSB0,"The Fox Channel is notorious for killing off shows with great potential.  Shows such as Family Guy, Futurama, and The Tick never got to live out what should have been a long lifespan.  Greg the Bunny is yet another one of these shows. But fans and television buffs should rejoice at this beautiful release. This 2-Disc DVD collection will contain all 13 episodes (including several never broadcast on TV), deleted scences, storyboards, commentaries, documentaries, and everything else you can sink your teeth into.  This show was pure brilliance and I shed a tear when it was canceled. Especially after hearing that the god-awful Oliver Beene would run for another season. So whether you were one of the thousands of people signing petitions to keep this show on the air or someone who typed the wrong thing into the search engine and came across this site you should pick up the Greg the Bunny entire series for your colection. And selling for less than $25 you can't go wrong. Check out TVShowsonDVD.com  or TVTome.com for more info on this and many other fine Tv shows.",1090886400,32,1072,4.809782608695652
2114554,4,B0002PYSB0,"OK I love Greg the Bunny, but I really hate this DVD. OK maybe I am being too tough on the DVD, the shows are funny just like I remember them. The problem is the DVD menu will not allow you to play all at one time so that each episode will automatically play after each other. Every DVD and Bluray I own except the two Greg the Bunny DVD's have either play the shows separately or chose ""Auto Play All""; and all shows will play one right after the other with no interruptions and no other input needed until all the episodes have finished.

Unfortuantely this was killed before its time, as FOX is won't to do.

All the episodes (including a few I'd missed when it was on TV).  The DVD's menus are unique, have character voices recorded specially for it, and are easy to navigate.  Finish an episode, it brings you to the next one.  Short summaries give you an idea which episode is which without spoiling the plot.",1353974400,,449,4.666666666666667
2114612,5,B0002PYSB0,I was very fortunate to find this series through Netflix and have been laughing ever since. The jokes are well timed and crude. I would expect nothing less from IFC.

2114613,5,B0002PYSB0,Greg the Bunny is another of the shows FOX cancelled before its day.  Serious discussion on race with a tongue in the cheek.,1327536000,,124,4.391304347826087
2114624,5,B0002PYSB0,"Like many shows, it takes a few episodes to gel, but it really gets good. I can only imagine how good a second season could have been. Warren is insane, but I really loved Susan and Tardy. I'm not a particular fan of either Seth Green or Eugene Levy, but the both come through and play their best roles ever.",1319587200,,308,4.15
2114625,4,B0002PYSB0,"It's hard to describe, but if I had to, Greg the Bunny is like The Simpsons mixed with a sitcom, but with half the cast as puppets. It's not subversive, not over-the-top, but at the same time it's not for kids either. Perhaps this is why it struggled to find an audience: too adult in content for kids, yet not 'adult enough' for the 18-25 group.

As other critics have said, there is a definite distinction between the 1st & 2nd halves of this season. Many episodes on Disc 1 are not super funny, but there are a few episodes -""Dottie Heat"", ""SK-2.0"", ""Rabbit Redux"" that are interesting and have their moments. ""SK-2.0"" has Jimmy creating a far-out revamped version of Sweetknuckle Junction, which is never really hilarious, but at least the idea is funny on paper.

I liked ""Rabbit Redux"" because it was different than the other episodes. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but... let's just say that a certain character has a nice montage of things he supposedly did on Sweetknuckle that is actually relatively funny, all things considered.

Often it seemed like these 1st episodes focused too much on one story. The best example of this is on episode ""Sock Like Me."" The story is so flat, which leads to one scene with a long & boring dialogue between Greg and Jack which is almost unbearable to watch.

The good news: Disc 2 is much better, integrating more complex storylines, and funnier moments. Besides the obvious upgrade of Greg's puppet, the 2nd half has better writing and generally seemed to work better comically. This produced 4 stand-out episodes. ""Jimmy Drives Gil Crazy"", ""Surprise!"", and ""The Singing Mailman"" -all nice gems & actually funny. Everyone mentions ""Surprise"" -which don't get me wrong, it IS a great episode- but I think they mostly like it mostly 'cause you see Sarah Silverman kissing a hot chick!

I think you HAVE to see ""The Singing Mailman"": Michael McDonald guest stars and has the funniest moment of the WHOLE SEASON if you ask me! Okay, so maybe it's only funny the 1st time, but I loved his song & dance number, and then how the episode ends with **SPOILER** ...the Sweetknuckle cast forming a gang/mafia to deal with the problem, lol. **/end** Good stuff, and by that point I really appreciated Tardy's character (which was largely ignored in the 1st half of the season).

But the best episode of all was... ""The Jewel Heist""!! This episode had it all: a paintball war, Tardy being retardedly funny at the worst (aka. BEST if you're watching) possible moment, Jimmy becoming a prep, and MORE which I don't want to ruin for you!

Overall, this Series is a mixed bag of both hits and misses on the comedy-front, but the characters are all good. If you can come in open-minded and NOT expecting Family Guy over-the-top, then you may be able to enjoy this.

I give it anywhere from a 3.5 - 3.7 (hence the 4 stars).",1318982400,,2863,4.655445544554455

2114646,5,B0002PYSB0,"This was quite easily the funniest show Fox has ever aired and they yanked it after seven episodes.  One of the many reasons a lot of us have quit watching Fox in general is their history of cancelling excellent shows because they didn't immediately get high ratings.  Greg the Bunny is just a silly, twisted, alternate reality show where puppets are just the same as people, only shorter and filled with fluff instead of blood & gore.  Seth Green & Eugene Levy worked wonderfully together as father & son, and the rest of the cast is just as insane as they are.

If the idiot network producers had known where they wanted Greg The Bunny to go, it would have not only been able to finish it's first season (2 episodes on the set never aired), but it would still be airing today. Seth Green, Eugene Levy, Sarah Silverman, Dan Milano, all comedic geniuses. If FOX only realized their mistake in cancelling this show, they'd be punching themselves in the face.

On disc 1 is a 30 minute documentary on the creation of greg the bunny and how he came to be. then there are deleted scenes and extended scenes with either commentary on without and there are a lot of them too, i though i accidentally put play all but i didnt, there sure were a lot of scenes that went on the cutting room floor and none were left out on this dvd.

another hilarious feature are the puppett auditions which is a must see.

whats great about the features is that each one has an introduction by greg himself, even the main menu

has audio instructions from greg

when you go the actual episodes there are 4 audio commentaries on  6 of the eps and each one is given a synpopsis of what it is about

i don't think i have  seen a more thorough dvd set for just 13 eps and i am just on disc 1

disc 2 has a feature called ifc greg the bunny reality show and follows greg around new york art galleries

there is also a short film featuring tardy the turtle calling tardy delivery

there are deleted and extended scenes

and 2 audio commentaries on 2 of the episodes

there are some easter eggs

and thats the only negative thing i have to say

i have no idea how to get to them

i am really happy to have these on dvd

I think there have only been a handful of truly funny shows--such as All in the Family, Taxi, Simpsons, etc. I wouldn't put Greg the Bunny in the same category as those, but it's just a step behind. And it's a giant leap ahead of just about anything else they'll put on the air.

The only complaint is there's no standout character, like an Archie Bunker or Barney Fife. I think Count Blah is the best character, but certainly not spectacular (blah). Despite this, it's a good ensemble piece, and works well because of good writing. I just don't think network tv is ready for a puppet show.

2114686,5,B0002PYSB0,"Greg the Bunny is doubtless one  wacky programme and exactly the kind of TV that probably suffered from being too brilliant a critique of its own medium. It's TV that turns TV into a TV dinner. It gobbles up the mechanics of television and spits them out again in one hell of a clever satire. Having never aired on Australian TV, I bought this copy as a punt: figuring that with Seth Green and Eugene Levy - and also the fantastic Sarah Silverman and Dina Waters, the latter searingly etched into my memories of Six Feet Under - this had to be pretty interesting stuff. The gamble paid off. GTB is truly bent TV. It is a fast paced, multi-layered work which clearly suffered a simliar - albeit two seasons earlier - fate as the peerless Arrested Development. Too visionary, or simply poorly marketed? Its cult status unquestionable and assured, GTB is bound to be a huge franchise in 20 years time when the movie remake hits the screens and the rest of the world catches up.

Greg the Bunny is part Sesame Street, part Meet the Feebles, part something else altogether, and clearly held big sway over the writers of the brillant Smile Time episode of Season Five of Angel, which it precedes.

Second viewing is a must - third and fourth viewings are a bonus, and god damn, for a being no more that a sock with button eyes, Greg the Bunny is an intriguing (and SOOO very cute) TV phenomenon. Excellent, excellent work.",1153872000,,1416,4.5234375

It had a much more subtle style than ""South Park,"" but definitely enjoys the same social jabs.

2114712,5,B0002PYSB0,"Someone really needs to write to FOX, telling them that they have to stop putting great shows on the air that they don't fully support.  It is really hard for us as an audience to take any more cancelled shows that not only are great, but have the potential to be even better.  Firefly, Family Guy, Wonderfalls, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, and Tru Calling (to name just a few) were all cancelled too soon, and the hilarious Greg the Bunny is no exception.

Taking a page from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, puppets (or fabricated Americans) live and work amongst us.  As the theme song says, they're just like us humans, only with lower doorknobs.  And while puppets can be cute, they can also be crude, drunk, violent, or any combination of the three.  The central character of the show is of course Greg the Bunny (Dan Milano).  He's a sweet-natured bunny puppet who, due to anti-puppet racism, is having a hard time finding a job.  His roommate Jimmy (Seth Green) has connections; his father Gil (Eugene Levy) works for Greg's favorite kids' show, the low-rated Sweetknuckle Junction.  Thinkning that he's going in to apply for an office job, Greg accidentally lands the starring role when the new network advisor Alison Kaiser (Sarah Silverman) decides that the old star is getting too old to be on the show (there are a few other reasons as well).

Soon, Greg is the new star of SKJ, and Jimmy is the newest production assistant (he has to get coffee for the demanding cast, deliver tapes, etc.).  Other castmembers include Jack (Bob Gunton), who plays a kind engineer on Sweetknuckle Junction, but is truly a paranoid gun nut who has some anger issues towards puppets.  Dottie Sunshine (Dina Waters) is the all-purpose girl on the show.  Both on and off camera, she is sweet and likable, but off camera, she has made a few bad decisions (mostly sexual in nature).  Then, there are the puppet castmembers.  Warren Demontague (Milano) plays Prof. Ape, the man who teaches a lot of the lessons on the show.  Warren is a classically trained actor who can only get gigs on childrens' shows, and this causes him to drink... a lot.  Count Blah (Drew Massey) is a sophisticated Romanian count with a verbal tick that causes him to say ""blah"" every few words.  While he is the most ""normal"" of the puppets, any mention of the Count from Sesame Street enrages him (Blah claims that the Count stole his act).  Tardy Turtle (Victor Yerrid) is a funny little addition; he doesn't have a distinct role to play on SKJ, but he is a hilarious addition to the show.  The things he does and says are priceless.  And then there's Susan (James Murray).  Susan is a (roughly) human-sized puppet who seems to be inspired by Sweetums from the muppets (the big, brown fuzzy guy with the big lips).  Despite being female, Susan has a deep voice that sounds a bit like Richard Nixon.

I still can't believe that this show got cancelled.  I had forgotten how funny it was until I saw it again on DVD.  The actors are amazing, and the writing is great for a show many might consider to be juvenile.  And while there are definitely some jokes that only work on one level (mostly the things involving Tardy), you'd be surprised at how deep some of the humor is.

It would be great if this show were ressurected in the same way that Family Guy was, but I doubt it will happen.  It doesn't have nearly the same fan base, and I don't think that the human cast would return.  Still, it would be great to see these puppets together again sometime.  Until then, enjoy this DVD.",1117929600,3,3548,4.575277337559429
2114723,5,B0002PYSB0,"With its low price and high return value, GREG THE BUNNY is one of the best shows on DVD you can buy! I am so glad the show is just as funny when you watch it again and again because even though I paced watching the episodes so they would last a while, I still finished way too soon!

While GREG THE BUNNY is most definitely not for everybody (I wouldn't recommend letting children watch it, except maybe for the Tardy extra where he delivers a postal letter), it is everything for the body that loves his or her humor delivered with wicked wisdom. Whether it is the acerbic Warren Demontague (a washed-up Shakespearean ape actor worthy of a ""Frasier"" episode) or the friendly, sometimes confused Greg the bunny (who always wants to play and means well even when he does something wrong), you will be more than satisfied with this slightly warped, sometimes disrespectful sense of humor.

As the SIMPSONS does (and often gets undeserved criticism for), GREG THE BUNNY pokes fun at things that society can take too seriously. Lost in all the hoopla by people who don't (or didn't) like the show is a beautiful honesty and friendship shared among a bunch of misfits who want to be seen as more than just puppets.

If nothing else, this show could serve as a warning to the good-natured Muppets as to what happens when good puppets go bad:). Kermit might not be green with envy at the lives these guys lead, but I bet even he would be flopping around a bit in gales of laughter. He might find himself taking Tardy (a slow-witted, but loving turtle) under his wing (make that webbed feet.)

As for me, this is something I adore and love to watch on rainy days when things seem a bit gloomy and out of focus. I recommend this DVD with lots of heart!",1114041600,3,1744,4.4576802507836994

I guess that people just have different senses of humor.

Greg definatly hits mine.

Now, I have to be honest.  I did not contribute to this show's sucess.  I never even watched it on T.V.

(FOX executives whom might be wanting to sue me do not read further.)

I downloaded a couple of episodes on a lark and couldn't stop laughing.  The first few episodes certainly had growing pains, but afterwards, the show just got wonderful.

Tardy's hilarious comments really could make the show.  Whilst playing the drums, saying ""Drumsticks can also be chicken."" and another time, ""Noone's supposed to touch me... where my baithing suit covers.""

Come on, that's great!

Oh and by the way, for those executives I was talking about before.  I will definatly buy this set as soon as I can.  Many people in my situation will.  Stop worrying about the downloading, sheesh.

2114727,5,B0002PYSB0,"Imagine a world where puppets lived among us and experienced the same trials and tribulations as we do.  The creators of Greg the Bunny did when they created this fresh and hilarious series.  Why it did not take off, I do not understand.  It was definitely promoted well.  Maybe this reasonably-priced DVD of its 13 episodes will help this show go the route of the newly-revived Family Guy (one never knows).  Anyway, the following is what Greg the Bunny left us (and we're still trying to clean it all up):

1. ""Welcome to Sweetknuckle Junction"":  Discrimination make it difficult for puppets (er, ""fabricated Americans"") to obtain jobs outside of the whack-a-mole machine at the arcade or kiddie television programs like Sweetknuckle Junction.  Jimmy's puppet roommate Greg the Bunny is facing that situation and luckily Jimmy's father Gil directs the SJ show.  When star Rochester Rabbit can no longer cut it, Greg wins the audition to takeover his job.  Will Rochester wage his revenge on the cute little bunny?

2. ""Sock Like Me"": This episode never aired and is my favorite on this DVD.  An anti-puppet slur (the ""S"" word, in this case, is ""Sock"") is written on the restroom wall which starts a campaign of anti-puppetism education.  Hilarious take on the human world of sensitivity training.

3. ""Dottie Heat"": Greg has puppet love for the wild Dottie.  Will the little bunny become a rabbit?  The puppets at the poker table gossiping about Sesame Street puppets (Burt and Ernie are straight...no way!) is a highlight.

4. ""SK-2.0"": A children's focus group, and Jimmy's advice, cause the show to go MTV.

5. ""Piddler on the Roof"": Warren, the alcoholic puppet gorilla who aspires to be a great Shakespearean actor, is literally p'd off when he thinks Alison will not let him perform Shakespeare on the show.

6.  Jimmy tries to make Alison jealous by coming on to this hideous-looking puppet Susan who smells of Scotchguard.  Meanwhile, to stop his constant nightmares, Greg tries to get Rochester back on the show.  The Rochester Roast is one of the funniest scenes in the series.

7. ""Father and Son Reunion"": Jimmy tries to cope with his parent's divorce.  His mother is played by Julie Hagerty from the Airplane movies.

8. ""Jimmy Drives Gil Crazy"":  Corey Feldman guest stars in this never aired episode where an errand to scoop up poop in Warren's yard ends up with Jimmy tied to Warren's bed & Greg and Feldman taking a joyride in Warren's car.

9. ""Greg Gets Puppish"": Another one of my favorites.  Greg tries to get back to his ""puppish"" roots with the help of the Jesse Jackson of the Puppet world.  A topic that hits very close to home.

10. ""Surprise!"": The cast tries to impress the TV Guide reporter that they are one big, happy family by giving Junction Jack a surprise birthday party.

11. ""The Jewel Heist"": Greg keeps getting attacked by the dog of Jimmy's new girlfriend.  Jack has a rather drastic, and irreversible, solution to the problem.

12. ""The Singing Mailman"": Dottie's in trouble when a Goodwill employee blackmails her after finding a porno video in a bag of her donated clothes.

13. ""Blah Bawls"": About my favorite character, Count Blah. Jimmy and Greg try to find Blah, who is pining away for his long dead wife, a new woman.  Blah ends up with Warren's ex (played by Mary Lou Henner).  Note: Blah's wife's headstone is engraved ""Beloved Wife Blah"" and ""R.I.P.B.""

Besides the two un-aired episodes, fans of the series will also enjoy a lot of extras with this set, including commentaries, an interview with Greg and Seth Green, promos, photo gallery, etc.  The puppet porno gallery that is advertised on the insert does not seem to be included (maybe that is a good thing).",1107043200,6,3716,4.802839116719243

New people to this series will become fans and old fans will kick back and laugh yourself silly as you watch this series again and again.

2114731,5,B0002PYSB0,"There are two palpable movements when you watch Greg The Bunny.  First is just how creative the cast and crew were.  You feel like they always wanted to do more.  The other movement is a show in disarray, being pulled in different directions by people with various intentions and interests.  Perhaps the former was caused by the latter.  Or perhaps the suits at Fox thought that too much creativity is a bad thing (which, admittedly, is somewhat possible when you're doing a network sitcom).  The only thing that kept the show together was pure will and sheer talent.  Through all the posturing and politicking, the show was still one of the funniest (and definitely quirkiest) on TV.  Watching these 13 episodes, you get the feeling the cast and crew could have churned out a two hour movie a week without missing a beat.  One thing I garnered from the commentaries and interviews on this DVD that I agreed with is that the creative team wasn't happy with Fox's decision to exploit Oz and ""the dad from American Pie.""  It's true.  The Fabricated Americans on the show are just such interesting characters, skillfully brought to life both physically and aurally, that the human cast should have really acted as a complimentary foil for Greg, Warren, Blah and Tardy.  That's not to say the human characters weren't all richly written and acted as well.  It's just a shame when you watch these episodes because you get the feeling that, once all the parties resolved their differences and the show really hit its stride, it would have been even better.  But that would have required a Season 2.  I often compare the comedic sensibilities to Family Guy, but warmer in tone and execution.  The show really strived to fit the sitcom mold, so cuts aren't lighting fast and the pace is surprisingly organic (considering how each episode was cut and recut numerous times).  Network TV wasn't a good fit for GTB (obviously).  But, I don't harbor any ill will towards Fox (not their broadcast division at any rate).  Many of my favorite shows have been canceled on the channel, from GTB to Firefly to Family Guy.  But we have to keep in mind that the other networks wouldn't have given five minutes to any of these shows.  Enjoy Greg The Bunny.",1102204800,7,2234,4.706185567010309
2114732,5,B0002PYSB0,"Maybe it was because I ""got it"" right off the get-go, that I was blinded to the preposterousness of puppets (or, to be more accurate, muppetoids) playing real characters in a comedy series.  Whatever it was, that got me hooked before I discovered the innate silliness of it all, I was happy just the same.

This series presented puppets, as an allegorical ethnic group, openly and blatantly being discriminated against in the workplace, in society, and even on national TV (shocking!!), and proved to be a sober second look at the treatment ethnic minorities have had to endure throughout the world and throughout history; while simultaneously poking fun at the ignorance and narrow-mindedness of those guilty of the abuses.

Perhaps because I grew up in Western Canada, where ethnic and cultural diversity is a more recent phenomenon (and for myself, anyway, a welcome alternative to the rather ho-hum status quo) I can look upon such issues more objectively than most US citizens reticent to having their noses rubbed in the mistakes of their evolving society.  Or perhaps I'm just into puppets?

Either way, whether the enlightened few of us tuned in to follow the exploits of a rather unkempt shag rabbit, whose obvious comedic talent is stifled at every turn by the prevailing prejudices, or keeping tabs on the indefatigable Count Blah, a dirty old puppet from Eastern Europe whose potential as a serial killer is constantly frustrated by the loss of his fangs years before; this series kept me giggling in rapt attention, and wonder at the sheer audacity of it all.  I guess the real problem with this series was the inability of its producers to predict that the majority of its target audience can't take a joke.

This is a wonderful series that most viewers, for one reason or another were unable to sample.  Seize your second chance, prove that the Neilson Ratings were wrong once again, and buy the DVD!",1101600000,7,1915,4.888888888888889

The DVD is called ""IFC TV Uncut: New Season Sneak Preview.""  ENJOY!

I never caught this show on TV when it was on, but I'm so glad I saw the DVD!  The creativity on this show, the humor, the acting ... it's all incredible.  After the first episode you really start accepting the puppets as ""real"" actors ... atleast I did.  So many great episodes, not one boring one in the bunch.  SO many cool (semi-hidden) extras/behind the scenes on this DVD, all dvds should be made with this one in mind!  Also, anything with Eugene Levy is bound to be pretty funny.  My favorite character was Count Blah.  But everyone on the show was terrific.  If you have a laid-back sense of humor and are open minded ... definitely give this DVD a try, you won't be disappointed, blah.  This show should have never been canceled, but I'm atleast glad they put out the first season on DVD for everyone to enjoy.  R.I.P.B.  Amazing DVD set, blah.",1100822400,,1275,4.535087719298246
2114745,5,B0002PYSB0,"The show never got much time in the spotlight, but it's clear its creators and actors savored every moment of it. In addition to all 13 episodes in their intended order, the set has a great selection of special features ranging from multiple commentaries to production stills to a short film featuring everyone's favorite turtle, Tardy.

The episodes are worth the price of admission. I find the show to be a scream. It can be juvenile at times, but hey, it's a puppet show! There are attempts made at social satire where the puppet community subs in for various other minorities, but the core humor comes from witty one-liners, slapstick, and a lot of toilet jokes. 'I made a smelly in my shelly!' - Tardy

Creator Dan Milano is extremely proud of Greg the Bunny and this is evident in the care taken with the extras. Virtually every special feature is introduced by either Greg or Warren and commentary is provided for half the episodes, deleted scenes, and the short Tardy film. Even the menus come with brand new dialogue by the puppet members of the cast. I found the featurette on how the show came into being both informative and fun, including brand new interviews with the creators, puppets, and actors. And don't miss the puppet audition tapes!

This set is a complete package. Sadly, it truly is complete. I salute you Greg the Bunny. We shall never see your likes again.",1098835200,43,1382,4.679012345679013

I felt that they didn't give firefly a fighting chance but I'M SO GLAD that Joss Whedon is coming out with firefly the movie!

 Snowball you complete me!! LMAO!!! Greg was hilarious! The cast is great too. The name of the show on Greg the Bunny,SweetKnuckle Junction, ah HA!!!! Many remember Bob Gunton (The Conductor) portayed as Warden Norton in the great movie ""The Shawshank Redemption"". But as far as favorite characters are concerned, Tardy the Turle takes the cake.

 ""Crayons taste like purple!""..... ""The green ones make me horny!"".... Rotflmmfao!...... little catch phrases like that killed me! I was dyin'! lol. Tardy made me laugh like no other character on that show.

 But anyway, I can't wait to add this to my 160+ dvd collection. This dvd will up there with Reno 911!, Chappelle's Show, Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly, SNL's The Best of Will Ferrell, Super Troopers, Old School, Van Wilder,and Out Cold.... some of my most favorite dvd's...... Can't Wait for Greg!!

And ALL of them except one are or are about to be released on DVD. ""ALF"", ""Arrested Development"", ""Seinfeld"", and FINALLY ""Greg the Bunny."" Now I just have to wait for ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe.""

I would come home from school every Tuesday and sit by the TV waiting for this show to come on. It was so original, funny, and off-the-wall that you could almost tell it wasn't going to last, so I wanted to see it as much as possible. FOX didn't really give this show a fighting chance, which is a real shame. I can't wait to watch all of these classic episodes again on DVD! I'm so happy! lol.",1097107200,9,755,4.171232876712328
2114751,5,B0002PYSB0,"This short-lived series is GREAT!  It brought a new face to comedy from our childhood memories about Sesame Street and the Electric Company.  A few favorite moments include Greg passing gas in the sink while he's taking a bath and the killer dog of his roommate's girlfriend that required Greg to get restiched up after loosing a lot of stuffing!

It's funny, original, excellent humour, enjoyable, plus it has Seth Green in it.  You must see it.  You won't be disappointed and you'll p_ss yourselves.  This is one of the best shows around (thanks Fox for cancelling it :(  !!!!) and Eugene Levy is as funny in this as in anything else he's been in.  I wish that more people had a chance to watch it, because it would have been more than a cult.  It would have been a show that could comedically take on the likes of other half hour comedies like Friends etc.  The humour in this is sometimes funnier.",1095379200,12,650,4.305785123966942

2114764,5,B0002PYSB0,"I am SO happy that this series is being released in a DVD. When I first heard about the show, I was skeptical. After all, the title nor the promotions gave no glimpse into what the real context of the show was about. My thoughts were ""Great. A kids 5-11 show in Primetime."" After viewing the first episode, I was hooked! My favorite show is when Greg goes to meet with ""Hmm Hmmanah"" to bring his case of alleged Puppet discrimination. Just the thought of that episode to this day make me laugh outloud!

When the show whent on ""hiatus"", we had a feeling that it wasn't coming back on, despite the great reviews it had received nationally.

I was going to put this under the Christmas tree for my husband, but we won't be able to wait two months for this gem!",1094774400,3,758,4.293706293706293
2114765,5,B0002PYSB0,"Fox has a way of killing great shows by placing them in bad time slots.  Greg the Bunny got great reviews from critics and fans alike, but was cancelled due to a wednesday night time slot, that for some reason just didn't target the core audience.  Same for FUTURAMA, fox put them on before the simpsons at 6pm central time, and I was never able to catch an episode.

But Greg the Bunny is a great watch.  Count Blah is by far my favorite character.  I don't know how long friends of mine were walking around going ""So how was your day, blah?"".

It is a great show, one of the more original ideas that has come out of fox in a really long time.  Pick this up and enjoy it, you will not regret it.",1094083200,14,696,4.073529411764706
2114766,5,B0002PYSB0,"Through the miracles of now-defunct file sharing services, friends and Fox's odd programming schedules, I managed to see most if not all of entire series.  THANK YOU Fox for appeasing your core audience and putting out this DVD collection.

""Greg the Bunny"" is not for your kids.  It's for you - the person that grew up with Sesame Street and graduated to Saturday Night Live and the Muppet Show (the FIRST one).

The series concept is hysterical.  The characters are incredibly original (and yet somehow familiar).  And the people....this is one of the best assembled casts that's seen hit the airwave.

You have a rabbit puppet that went to school with a human geek (Seth Green) -- yes, HIGH SCHOOL!  Eugene Levy is the father of the geek that also happens to direct his own kid's television show.  You have Sarah Silverman - a real unused talent - as the show's network producer and Bob Gunton and Dina Waters as the two wonderfully flawed human actors on the show.  Sunshine and light one moment - neurosis and addiction in the next.

As for the rest of the puppets - I don't want to spoil all of it.  If you've ever been to the zoo, picture the ape reciting Shakespeare and drinking - alot!  There you have it!  And that's the tip of the iceberg.

I honestly think that this would have been the next ""Arrested Development"" if Fox hadn't decided to give ""The Bernie Mac Show"" more marketing dollars that year. (Much love Bernie --- you're on my TiVo every week!!!)

Alas - this is the only DVD in the series unless sales are high and they revive the show.  I hear that will happen right after they bring back Cheers, Seinfeld and Friends. :)",1093737600,15,1645,4.522033898305085
2114767,5,B0002PYSB0,OK...i watched the first episode of this show not knowing what to expect i've seen the commercials and saw some of the press junkets...upon the first viewing of this show i found myself laughing quite often...my fave character is definitely count blah!  fox didn't do this show justice...you need to show more than 10 eps to get a show watched...they learned their lesson with family guy and now they know better...if you love family guy...you'll love this show!  i can't wait for the dvd!!!,1093305600,7,491,4.833333333333333
2114768,5,B0002PYSB0,"I know many people who appreciate funny and well-written shows.  It disappointed me that most of those people never gave this show a chance.  Perhaps it was the title, network or trailers.  Nonetheless it is very very unfortunate that more of the 'masses' didn't 'get' what this show was about.  It's a hilarious show involving a world where puppets are 'alive' and the 'kids show' that's revolving this show shows the 'puppets' having all the human foibles (and more) that's found in everyday life - but with creative and very humorous writing.  I've been praying that the show would continue since it made myself and my girlfriend laugh out loud many, many times.  The humor is all-adult; and that's what leads me to believe that's why this show 'failed'.  The title and trailers made it seem like a 'family/kids' show when the reality is it isn't.  Couple the title and trailers w/the timing of when the show was on originally equates to adults saying ""I'm not watching a 'kids show' in prime-time!"".  So to those adults out there that enjoy adult humor w/a 'twist' on puppets - GET THESE DVD's.... I know I am and I can not wait to see the 2 episodes never aired.  And to the IFC which, I hear, is bringing it back for at least one new episode: cheers - don't let this die, please 're-package' it so that the 'masses' will understand that it's an 'adult' show...",1093132800,7,1366,4.584362139917696
2114769,4,B0002PYSB0,"I happened upon this show while surfing and caught the ""paint-ball"" episode.  I had heard about Greg the Bunny somwhere and quickly surmised that this must be it.  I liked it immediately and accepted the puppets-as-""co-denizens"" concept readily.  I had a very hard time there after trying to catch its air time.  I guess I caught the program on its way out, because I never saw it again.  I think it was actually advertised to appear on a particular night and then canceled before that airing.  I own a poor, 4 vcd compilation of this series and have desparately been waiting for its official release.  I can wait a little longer for its October release date.  I don't give anything five-stars, and this is no exception.  I do however, give it my highest four-stars. (I also give ""The Best Of Triumph the Insult-Comic Dog"" DVD a four as well).  Back to Greg.  I really enjoy this puppet-human interaction concept immensely. The show acknowledges that the puppets are fabric/cloth yet they eat, drink and have sexual relations.  Its hilarious.  I appreciate the professional actors that agreed to lease their chops to this innovative concept. The actor (whose name I do not know. Sorry.) who plays Junction Jack (What a departure from the Shawshank Redmption warden), Eugene Levy, Sarah Silverman, Seth Green and the others all create a quality production.  I don't think this could be re-created again so I do not think It should be attempted.  I'm just grateful that what was created will now be available for our continued enjoyment.  As a ""Greg"" fan, I would be interested in a DVD of his work not affiliated with the Fox network.",1093132800,3,1633,4.7785714285714285
