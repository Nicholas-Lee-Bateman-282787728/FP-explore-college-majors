8427959,2,B004FN25AQ,"I am not sure why I was watching the American version, but this is the same documentary on the same tigress Lakshmi from India by the BBC Natural History Unit. Since I already had the BBC Wildlife Specials series on the Bengal Tiger, I did not have any idea if the same documentary was shot by National Geographic Society. Although well documented by National Geographic, the picture quality seemed old and could have been remastered. Nevertheless, the BBC narration by Sir David Attenborough was way better than the National Geographic version. The female narrator seemed boring and monotonous to me, which definitely killed the documentary for me.",1370822400,3,649,5.074766355140187
8427960,5,B004FN25AQ,"The Tigers Of Kanha is the actual title of this documentary about a 12-year-old tigress named Lakshmi and her three tiger cubs living in Kanha National Park in India.  There are scenes of Lakshmi running in graceful stretching motion after spotted deer; she runs down a monkey and a spotted deer and claims a carcass from wild dogs and vultures.  The tiger cubs play vigorously with each other and with Lakshmi, who sometimes roars in mild irritation at them.  There are many close-up portrait scenes of tigers, monkeys, spotted deer, wild dogs, and wild cattle.

Forest rangers, who ride elephants around the park in checking on the tigers, find a dead 8-year-old 10-foot male tiger, who is viewed as the father of Lakshmi's cubs, and the head of a small tiger cub, both of which are viewed as being killed by an invading male tiger.  The rangers find Lakshmi in a seriously injured condition with eight deep cuts; she walks weakly away into the forest, and two of her cubs also disappear.  The emotional ending states that ten months later, Lakshmi and her three cubs were found alive and well.",1303776000,5,1096,4.742105263157895
