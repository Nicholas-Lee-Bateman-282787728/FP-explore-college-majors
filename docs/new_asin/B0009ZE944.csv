2344001,2,B0009ZE944,"Heimat or Homeland tells the history of Germany through the eyes of the extended multi-generational Simon family who hail from the fictional rural village of Schabbach in the Hunsrck.

It is a great TV series, one of the few that can truly be called epic. The original 16 hour long miniseries eventually spawned 2 sequels to form the Heimat Trilogy which runs for a total of 54 hours. This present release is the original 16 hour miniseries now also known as Heimat I, and essentially follows the life of Maria Simon from the age of 17 in the aftermath of the First World War, through the rise of Nazism, the destruction of the Second World War, the rebuilding of Germany and its subsequent prosperity. It spans the years from 1919 to 1982 and ends with the passing of Maria. Filmed in 1984 for German TV, it features over 140 speaking roles and has literally a cast of thousands. Heimats II and III chronicle the life of Maria's son and take us through German reunification and into the new millennium. Throughout it seamlessly marries the epic sweep of history with the personal and intimate lives of its participants.

The original 16 hour Heimat won the FIPRESCI Prize (awarded by the International Federation of Film Critics) at the 1984 Venice Film Festival. Its sequel, the 26 hour long ""Die Zweite Heimat"" (Heimat II) took home the Special Jubilee Prize at the 1992 Venice Film Festival.

This monumental series certainly deserves a lot better than what Facets Video has provided. The Facets release comes with a soft, blurry picture. Colors are washed out. It is like watching a video tape. The reason is that it was transferred from a Beta cam video source. The picture quality is in short horrendous. To top it off, the large English subtitles are not removable. They are permanently burnt onto the film.

There is a Region 2 version released in November 2004 (on Tartan Video). It is superior in every way imaginable and despite its higher price is the preferred choice. The picture quality there is superb because it was mastered from the original film source. The image is clear and sharp. Colors are rich and vibrant. The English subtitles are optional and can be removed. It is treated in a way that befits this grand epic. The presentation is also so much more attractive; it comes in the form of a thick hardcover book with dark leather binding and gilt edges. You can see a review and comparison of both versions at [...]. Avoid this Facets release. The Region 2 version is still available from Amazon UK although it is supposed to be a limited release. Don't be swayed by the cheaper Facets version. It does not do justice to this monumental work. Get the original. Keep in mind that your DVD player must be able to play back Region 2 discs and your system must have native PAL capability. German and UK programs are all recorded in PAL format, not the standard American NTSC.",1124928000,170,2896,4.68369351669941

2344004,5,B0009ZE944,"This is a teriffic piece, tracing the lives of the people of Schabbach from post WW1 to the early 80's in Germany.  The whole thing is in German with some English and French and all subtitled in English.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good cultural view of Germany.  The film focuses on the 30's and 40's in great detail, as it was a responce to an American Holocost Film, but the real emphasis is on the development of German society and the different facets of the population.

NOTE: It IS over 16 hours long in several chapters ranging from 45 minutes to well over 2 hours.  Don't let that dissuade you.  It's better to watch when you don't care how long it takes anyway :)",1167782400,8,693,4.333333333333333

I have Facets All-Zone NTSC version, and the video is crisp, clear, and clean.  I highly recommend this version.",1165536000,7,253,4.837209302325581
2344006,3,B0009ZE944,"My only complaint about this DVD package is a lack of supplemental material. A character gallery or an interactive family tree might have helped. As a TV series, Heimat is somewhat uneven in quality and suffers from some odd continuity (it never explains, z. B., how a German immigrant to the US with, as far as we know, no money and connections or the ability to speak English ends up as a millionaire CEO in just 17 years, during the Depression no less). The entire ""Little Herman"" section is dull beyond belief and can be safely skipped over, since it contributes nothing to the main plot beyond several scenes of the smoking hot German actress Gudrun Landgrebe in the altogether. Taken as a whole, however, Heimat is addictive viewing, not unlike a fictional version of Michael Apted's ""7 Up"" series.",1153008000,6,804,4.75
2344007,5,B0009ZE944,"Very compelling story. While a little hard to follow in some places it totally sucked me in, to the point where I desperately wanted to see Volume 2 which just came out in the US & Volume 3, which is currently not available in the US. This is one of my top ten films of all time.

The video quality is AWFUL. This was obviously mastered from a home recorded video tape. Originally, I thought the washed out colors were an artistic decision made by the director, but then I read online reviews that the UK Tartan edition has vivid color. I have purchased the Tartan edition from Amazon. UK. If you have a Multi Region player, I strongly suggest doing that rather then buying this edition. 5 STARS FOR THE FILM, 1 STAR FOR THE DVD TRANSFER.",1148256000,21,738,4.3478260869565215
2344008,5,B0009ZE944,"I'm very confused by some of the previous, negative reviews.  I did buy the ""region zero"" DVD release and it's perfectly fine.  The series itself is a true masterpiece, a sublime work of art.

One of the previous reviews referred to the ""fogginess"" of the DVD transfer, but this is a television series that was produced in monochrome and PAL color, not Cinemascope.  It's supposed to be perceived in a haze: it's an intentional effect meant to allude to the visualization of memory.  Sometimes black-and-white, sometimes color.  I personally find it extremely effective.",1145318400,13,570,5.075268817204301
2344009,5,B0009ZE944,"This is an astonishing piece of filmmaking that becomes more and more absorbing with each successive episode. You can spread the experience over several days or immerse yourself in a Heimat weekend. In either case, you'll likely return to it again and again for years to come.  Despite a negative comment from another reviewer, the quality of the newly released DVD is excellent, and the new white-on-black subtitling finally ends those maddening white-on-whites that cause you to miss lines of dialogue. I myself have seen all versions of Heimat: theatrical release, VHS and DVD and this new DVD is by far the best of the three.",1128297600,42,629,4.933962264150943
2344010,1,B0009ZE944,"I was eagerly awaiting Heimat - one of the greatest classics ever. However, the DVD transfer is the worst I have seen. It was like looking through a foggy window. I am not kidding. Rent and see for yourself. Do not buy this version of the DVD and reward the nitwits who released this.

Apparently Region 2 version is better although I haven't ordered it yet.",1126310400,35,358,4.424242424242424
2344011,1,B0009ZE944,"Facets had previously released Heimat on VHS. I've seen the VHS release, and it's pretty good. Unfortunately for the DVD, it appears Facets simply re-used their VHS master. (I don't know this to be true, but that's certainly how it *looks*. Rumor on the internet seems to be the source was 1"" Beta tape; I wonder if this was the same source used for the VHS.) The effect is this DVD has the quality of a bad bootleg: the color is washed out and the picture much, much less than crisp.

Most infuriating: the package says ""in German with English subtitles."" The subtitles, however, are nothing like ""subtitles"" in any DVD-sense of the word: they were present on the analog video master -- and sure do appear to be the same titles as the VHS edition. As such, they are *part* of the film and CANNOT BE TURNED OFF. Plus, the titles are white letters on a black field (like closed captioning), so they really obscure a significant portion of the frame. If you understand German this will be especially infuriating; if you don't understand German, these ""subtitles"" will be less readable than the proper ""subtitles"" on other DVDs.

Sometimes, it may well be reasonable to release a DVD mastered from a relatively low quality source -- as when high quality sources no longer exist. In this case, though, Facets has no excuse: Tartan released a region 2 DVD of Heimat in the UK (available from amazon.co.uk) which was reportedly beautifully done and with proper DVD subtitles. (There are also German and Dutch editions, but, unfortunately, neither has English-language subtitles.)",1126137600,72,1573,4.822222222222222

This television series does a wonderful job of taking you inside the lives of a German family in a fictional village, starting 1919 and ending in 1982. I have always been frustrated in studying history because all too often it is a depersonalized recitation  of facts. That is not the case with ""Heimat"". It's personal. Real.

The camera and graphic style used captures the bold colors of the German countryside and also adds a nice rustic charm to the environs of Hunsruck. Beside from the captivating visuals, I also did not find the English subtitles to be distracting in the least. After 16 hours, one barely notices them in the frame except so that they can read them.

8070817,4,B0009ZE944,"Heimat: A Chronicle of Germany  (Edgar Reitz, 1984)

For the first few hours of the massive undertaking that is Heimat, I wasn't sure I was going to stick through the whole thing. But as the sheer magnitude of what it was that Reitz was attempting really sank in, I found myself getting more and more absorbed. Then came the final few scenes of the last episode, and while I don't quite agree, I can see why a number of critics call this one of the thousand best movies ever made.

Heimat gives us eighty-odd years of German history as reflected in the life of Maria Simon (The Princess and the Warrior's Marita Breuer), born in 1900, over the course of fifteen and a half hours. (Yes, this is not a movie you will be watching in a single sitting.) We see her, her parents and grandparents, ultimately her descendants, mostly in and around the small village of Schabbach. This is a slice-of-life film whose aim, as the subtitle tells us, is to encapsulate the twentieth-century German experience in one village. There are a huge number of stories to be told, and all of them are given screen time, thought, and sensitivity by Reitz and scriptwriter Peter Steinbach (whose only work outside TV was 2001's Goebbels und Geduldig). As one might expect from any film that runs more than fifteen hours, the pace tends to flag at times, and there will be stretches where the viewer feels the need to not hit the pause button when getting up and making a sandwich. Resist the urge, however, as those times are relatively short, and the film picks back up again quickly in every case. These characters are fascinating, especially when one gets past World War II and into the funky fifties. (This is not much of a surprise; Reitz was born in 1932, and so was 18 in 1950, giving him far more firsthand experience of the times of the last few episodes.) And given this much time to really get to know the village of Schabbach, we find that it has become a character itself, inasmuch as it changes right along with its inhabitants over the years. (Contrast to, say, the little village in Last of the Summer Wine, where the producers have taken pains to show as little change as possible over the thirty-five years the series has been running.)

This is fantastic stuff, and well worth watching. I strongly recommend it. ****",1227052800,7,2311,4.588377723970944
8070818,5,B0009ZE944,"Facets have done it again. They have released this German Masterpiece with an appalling dvd transfer. The quality is so bad that it is unbelivable. I just don't know why Facets release dvd's , the majority of them are of such bad quality. If possible try to track down the region 2 version , the transfer is excellent.

As for the series itself , it's a brilliant piece of film making and a must see.",1222041600,6,400,4.333333333333333
8070819,3,B0009ZE944,"A little more than ten years ago, in my days of heroic cinephilia, I did saw Heimat, the German miniseries directed by Edgar Reitz, that deals in 11 episodes with the life of a German family from 1919 to 1982. Every day they showed one of the episodes in the Buenos Aires Cinematheque, and I remember going to see it every day (I was at the university at the time, studying a subject totally unrelated to filmmaking, so I was certainly sacrificing hours of study to see this). After Heimat, they did show Heimat II, which is even longer, but I only saw a couple of episodes of that. Heimat is good and compelling, though I will stop short in calling it a masterpiece. And at the end, it is a miniseries about a family living in a small German town, during a century which was quite eventful for Germany. Besides, I don't remember a lot about the film itself, so is not very memorable (great movies should stay in one's mind long after you saw them). So I can't say whether I can reccomend this, unless you are a voracious cinephile (just as I was, some years ago) that wants to see everything, the odder the better.",1200787200,2,1115,4.365384615384615
