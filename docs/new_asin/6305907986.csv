1091891,2,6305907986,"I probably made the mistake of my life watching this a) alone and b)  sober. Under these circumstances this is my undisputed favourite for the  fancy title ""most boring film of all times"". It contains about as  much exploitation as a videotaping of a third-graders summer camp (except  you're still shocked by some harmless PG-13-nudity) and acted even worse  (just watch Blaze walk like someone had replaced her spine with a  broomstick through the entire movie). But given a couple of friends in the  right mood and a case of beer or two you'll probably end up rolling on the  floor laughing considering the dumb dialogue, the annoying acting and the  stupid soundtrack.  Besides that the DVD transfer is wonderful with  splendid, if sometimes too artificial looking colors, and the two bonus  striptease sequences are a treat, though. Recommended mostly for die-hard  fans and camp collectors.",968198400,12,896,5.054794520547945

Now more self-reliant than ever, this causes a rift  between Blaze and her manager.  How will it end? This is camp madness!  Bad  acting, bad blocking, badly looped soundtrack, and a lame excuse to show  lots of naked people at a nudist colony.  It is sheer camp HEAVEN.  And the  Eastmancolor print is FABULOUS.  NEVER has Eastmancolor looked this good.  This movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry (with laughter), it  will make you the hit of the party!",963705600,18,636,4.571428571428571

The over-done makeup, plastic uhhh - I guess then you would have had to call it ""frontal development"" back then, and carefully-staged photography to keep viewers from seeing full frontal nudity (horrors!) - were amusing.

1092507,5,6305907986,"Synopsis:
  Two aspiring scientist/astronauts are able to bring their dream of travelling to the moon to fruition thanks to the timely inheritance of a dead uncle, and when they get to the moon their wildest fantasies become reality; sort of.

Review:
  The professor and Jeff are a couple of fun loving Florida scientists dreaming of going to the moon.  Sure they could embark upon challenging careers with NASA and claw their way to the top of the heap in the hopes of being chosen for a moon mission; but hey why wait for all that crap.  They've been working on building their own moon rocket and when Jeff arrives to deliver the sad, but great news about his rich uncle's demise they have the one thing lacking in their plans; enough money to finish their rocket.  The old guy was loaded leaving Jeff just over 3 million and that's more than enough to get their little science project off the ground.

  Now I don't know if there was some sort of impound fee or storage bill for their rocket, but the much needed funds send them right from the lab to the cockpit in minutes and they are on their way.  The arrival to their spaceship and subsequent takeoff is perhaps one of the funnies moments in cinema.  That is of course, until we get to ride along with them and watch their hilarious in flight conversation conducted over microphones and headsets when they are quite literally inches from each other. I have to admit they put a lot of effort into this part and it's probably the best acting of the film.  The exciting climax of their journey is the moment they both pass out opening the possibility of a dream sequence.

  Jeff and the Prof wake up after they land and they are quite comfortable with assuming the ship just seems to have landed without their help.  They immediately venture out to investigate the wonders of the moon.  You will be amazed at what passes for space suits on this mission which seems to be entirely equipped by Mattel.  They are shocked at how earth like the moon is with all the trees and ferns getting in the way of their search for craters.  To be more accurate, the moon seems to share a lot of similarity with South Florida which also just happens to be where most of the movie was shot.  They do remark on how surprising similarity is, but don't seem to be all that excited about the huge garden wall blocking their path.

Jeff and the Prof take turns helping each other climb up and peer over the wall watching the moon people at play.  That's right!  Moon people or more accurate, topless moon people are frolicking in the lovely moon gardens worshiping their queen as she sits upon a marble throne.  It seems Jeff and the Prof have discovered that even on the moon size matters.  The queen is sporting a seriously commanding set of DD coronation tiaras that get places long before she does.  Her bust is the only thing in this film temporarily suspending disbelief giving the illusion that the lack of sagging could actually be due to the lower gravity of the moon. In fact, if you think about it, this film could very well be the inspiration for the long time trend towards breast augmentation in show business.  Aspiring actors, directors, and producers must have looked to this film wondering how this stinker could have come to be.  When you watch it, you'll see an amazing pair of answers staring right back at you.

Lessons Learned:
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there were perverts.
You don't need a space suit on the moon but a heavy gage under-wire bra would come in handy.
In space no one can hear you lactate.
At least we now know why those Apollo guys had trouble walking when they got back.",1328400000,5,3664,4.4811463046757165

1092509,5,6305907986,"If you're here looking for a Bermanesque treatise on the soul, you're looking in the wrong place.  Pay little attention to the fellow that posted the previous review.  Just by looking at the title, he should have known what he was getting into and he deserved to be disappointed. Yes, the acting is bad and the budget is lower than most but Doris Wishman's films have their own particular charm.  The folks responsible for The Incredibly Strange Film Show (a British documentary series from the late 80's that profiled cult directors-Wishman shared a profile with Fred Olen Ray) briefly compared her to Jean-Luc Godard in her disregard for the rules of classic film composition.  Doris is probably best known for her movies starring Chesty Morgan, Deadly Weapons and Double Agent 73.  Enough digression.  Both Nude on the Moon and Blaze Starr Goes Nudist are fun nudie cuties/nudist camp flicks.  Nude on the Moon (which Doris shared co-director credit with Raymond Phelan) is a ridiculous little sci-fi/nudist camp romp that is pretty tame compared to the films nowadays.  The story involves two astronauts that fly a ship to the moon and discover that the moon kinda' looks like Florida and is filled with topless women wearing dimestore deely bobbers on their heads.  Think of Cat Women of the Moon or The First Men in the Moon but with topless nudity.  Blaze Starr Goes Nudist is notable for a rare film appearance by burlesque star Blaze Starr in the title role.  It's a pretty standard nudist camp flick but fun to watch anyway.  Are these great movies?  Not really.  But they're fun, especially if you enjoy oddball exploitation cinema.  And don't be expecting the aerobicized surgically enhanced folks from today's movies.  These are everyday folks in the buff (most of them probably grandparents or great-grandparents).",1267574400,34,1828,4.983498349834983

1092511,5,6305907986,"My husband and his family knew Blaze from the late 1950's through the 60's when they lived next door to her in Baltimore. After all these years, we just got this DVD to see what it was about. Blaze Starr Goes Nudist is a fun, sometimes slow going, cult, campy movie. If you want pornography--don't buy this one. If you want to see an Icon of the 50's and 60's whose amazing life is well documented in her autobiog and the movie, Blaze (Paul Newman, Lolita Davidovitch), in almost all her natural glory, by all means get this movie. It's so early 60's in clothing and backgrounds. The acting wouldn't win any awards, but so what?

We chuckled at the scenes where Blaze drove her car -- she really didn't know how to drive (or needed to at that time). And an early scene at the pond has live ducks scooting around in the background and a family of ducks sitting by some of the girls which never move a feather.

From what I recall of the standards of the time, the partial nudity is tastefully done. Men wear shorts if their scenes have them facing the camera and the women are posed so that there are no Britney Spears disasters.

All in all, a tame romp featuring the glorious red-head Blaze Starr. DVD clarity was superb, by the way.",1201046400,19,1234,4.356521739130435
1092512,2,6305907986,"Blaze Starr is bored with her life and becomes happy only when she finds a nudist camp, where she feels at home. That's about as far as the story goes. The film is an ultra low budget movie, relying heavily on off-screen narration. Whenever there's dialogue, the camera always shows the person not talking, or - as when Blaze talks on the phone - the character has his or her back to the camera. This way they didn't need to bother synchronizing image and sound.

There's no story to speak of and the movie isn't very good at all. It interesting only as a curiosity piece, as an example of the low budget nudie cutie genre of its time.",1159660800,2,635,4.336134453781512
1092513,3,6305907986,"Given the retraints of the time, this is an entertaining enough video.  The nudity is very limited, which is awkward given that it is a nudist video.  Much better Naturist documentaries are now on DVD, like Mother Naturists and Rituals of Summer both here at amazon.  It also doesn't make much sense to have these old titles on DVD as the image quality pales in comparison to the more recent Naturist productions, like the 2 listed above.  Overall a fun oldies film but don't expect much nudism.",1043539200,15,495,4.655172413793103
