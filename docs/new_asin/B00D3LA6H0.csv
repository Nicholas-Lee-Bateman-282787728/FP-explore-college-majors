5771927,4,B00D3LA6H0,"The film recaps the 1984 classic, including a few memorable nude scenes so you can keep up. The nuclear plant was bull dozed and over top of it was placed an organic food company which sells stuff to the local charter school. The green substance from the food has different effects on people from exploding heads and burning bodies to becoming ""Cretins"" as did the glee club.

Chrissy (Asta Paredes) the main character runs a blog about the evils of Tromorganic Plant. Catherine Corcoran plays Lauren, the new girl who joins Chrissy.

The humor is non-stop Troma over the top. It is inane and crude as expected. The film also has some spoofs. The teachers' names are Mr. Chips and Miss Crabtree. The principal impersonates Nixon when he talks. The party sex scene is a spoof of the party sex scene in the original 1984 film. It also has some lines that made me laugh. When Lauren was ""duck raped"" and had a duck's head lodged in her mouth, Chrissy says to her, ""Get in, fowl mouth."" Ouch! I had to laugh.

Part one ends abruptly (Shades of Hobbit 2) in what appears to be a Carrie-like shower scene.

Film includes exploding heads, large fake male organs, melting breasts, plus your typical Troma style blood and gore.

This film will appeal to only a narrow audience, i.e. Troma fans. 4 stars on the Troma scale.

Perv Guide: F-bomb, sex, and nudity (Catherine Corcoran, Asta Paredes plus about 9 others) In a few of the scenes Asta reminded me of Anne Kendricks, and that can't be all bad.",1391126400,11,1491,4.5655430711610485

5771935,3,B00D3LA6H0,"Fun movie. Filmed in a classic 1980-style horror genre. Expect nudity, heads blowing up, cheezy lines, weak story, but a whole lot of fun. These mindless movies are fun to watch and this could be an essential movie for your Midnight Madness!",1404345600,,241,4.761904761904762

5771938,3,B00D3LA6H0,"I don't know what to make of this movie. It was bad. REALLY really bad. So bad, in fact, that it seems rather impossible to think it wasn't intentional. Yes, I know Troma Entertainment films are supposed to be stupid, low budget, and have bad acting. But I am not a huge fan of the company. So I'll have to judge this as an ""outsider.""

The movie itself barely has a plot. I know of the original Nuke Em High, but what the hell is even going on, here? I'd say a 13 year old wrote this, but that'd be horribly offensive to 13 year olds. Not to mention, all the distasteful, sometimes 'turn away from the screen' gross-out porn-horror scenes in the movie. One of which, starts right at the opening as a mutant creature attacks a couple of teens while they have sex nude. Yeah. Its *that* kind of movie.

The problem here is, unlike other stupid movies, there's never a break from the absurdity or ridiculousness. There's never any serious moments or plot points to give you a break from the sheer stupidity and Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber and Jerry Sandusky references. Its almost like a Friedberg and Seltzer movie, but even *they* have breaks inbetween the lame pop culture jabs and references. Here, its literally non-stop stupidity and fart jokes. Not ONE moment of seriousness to drive the plot forward. That's what makes it, well... ""too stupid.""

Besides that, there's also the super-raunchy and filthy sex jokes. More than one of them include green toxic menstrual cycles. Then there's the two lead characters, nice ""rich girl"" Lauren and poor, aggressive Hispanic girl Chrissy. Both are lesbians who go from enemies, to fremenies, to lovers. But when they get mutated, Chrissy grows a giant penis and Lauren grows a mutant baby and the ability to spray poisonous acid from her lactating breasts. Again. Its on *that* level of stupidity. As I said, if there was any moments of non-stupidity or even brief seriousness in the movie, it MIGHT have worked.

Worst part of all is, this is just Part One! It ends very abruptly, like they ran out of money halfway or something. The movie really doesn't offer much (or any) storyline. The dorky losers of the Glee Club get mutated into the powerful and violent Cretins. The Cretins then pull a mean prank on Lauren by stuffing her pet duck in her mouth. ""Duck Rape."" Then, Chrissy and Lauren become powerful mutants (with the sex joke appendages) and get revenge on the Cretins. Then, the Cretins start a fire at a house party thrown by Lauren's friends and Chrissy's ex-boyfriend. Then Chrissy and the large female Cretin get into a fight at school before the cliffhanger ending to Part One. What strikes me as odd is, considering every single student at Tromaville High owns a gun or owns some other kind of deadly weapon, why wouldn't the Cretins be easily dealt with? Especially since almost none of them are armed. At the very least, the school itself has armed security that do the weapons check at the front entrance, so where were they? I guess this isn't the kind of movie where logic is applied.

That's literally all of the plot and story within this movie. The rest is just one bad fart or dick joke after the other, with the occasional lewd gross-out sex scene or pop culture reference, such as a parody of ""Glee"" or school shooting jokes. I am *far* from thin-skinned, so even the school/movie theater shooting references didn't bother me (yes, there are actually TWO jokes about mass shootings in this film). However, if you're going to go there, it should at least be FUNNY controversial material. Don't just do it for the sake of offending the easily-offended, which is what it felt like more than anything else.

I dunno. Maybe I am just WAAAAAY too smart for this movie. Maybe I am too sober for this and need to take a large amount of drugs and/or alcohol in order to enjoy this. As I said, it's literally non-stop stupidity, way too over-the-top, tries WAY too hard to be ""funny,"" and when that fails, they just throw in something controversial or lewd and disgusting, usually involving female anatomy. But if all this sounds like fun to you, then by all means, go ahead.

I can't rate this too low, because I simply think I'm just not the audience for this. I don't ""get it."" Its SO ridiculously bad and stupid, that it has to be intentional, and I guess, I'm just missing that part of it. I mean, I loved ""Troll 2"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and the latter two weren't even *trying* to be intentionally bad or funny. So if Lloyd Kaufman was trying to make the worst movie he possibly could for an audience that loves over-the-top horrendously terrible movies, then mission accomplished. Again, I simply must be too out-of-the-loop to ""appreciate"" it.",1397347200,,4757,4.63582443653618

Well, for a small fee this classic bit of cinema can be yours, to enjoy from the butt flattened luxury of your basement sofa. Trust me, Sally, this is classic Troma and you need to own it.
