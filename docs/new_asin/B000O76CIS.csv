8183208,3,B000O76CIS,I've bought several Hindi DVD for my children. This one is OK. I like you are able to pronounce the Devanagari. I didn't like you didn't have English script to know what they were saying as in my other videos. Good for learning how to pronounce the alphabet which is what we wanted.,1224720000,3,282,4.339622641509434
8183209,5,B000O76CIS,I bought this DVD for my 4.5 yr old daughter and she liked it. Has shown lot of interest in learning hindi alphabet. I find this DVD serves the purpose - it makes fun way to understand all the hindi alphabets and vowels with the songs. Choice of background music is especially very good and known to all kids.,1185753600,5,309,4.254237288135593
