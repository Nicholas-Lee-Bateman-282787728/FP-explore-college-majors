6567551,5,B00MBJOKRW,"I waited for a while for the blu ray to arrive as when I booked it then it was out of stock. As a true blue and die hard fan of Air Supply I was very delighted to have this music concert right in my home theater. I never got a chance to watch them live but this one really made it up for the lost years.
On to the video, I must say the sound and video quality was top notch. Even though Russell may have aged but he is able to pull through with ease on those high notes as almost all their hits are included here and I particularly liked ""Goodbye"" which he performed admirably well. I thought the musicians backing them was fantastic too which is very important in a concert.
I am glad I didn't let this one gone past me and if you are an Airheads you will not be disappointed.",1419811200,2,777,3.9554140127388533
6567552,5,B00MBJOKRW,"I am surprised that I am giving this 5 stars but the show was fantastic. I have been quite critical about Air Supply over the last decade. They realesed the atrocious ""Across The Concrete Sky"" (their worst record in my opinion) and the disappointing Mumbo Jumbo and a few live DVD's. The first being ""It Was 30 Years Ago Today"" where Russell sounded awful and Air Supply Live 3 years ago which was sub par and had to be bought through them at the price gouging price of $30.00 plus I believe it was $10.00 shipping then delivered in a card board sleeve. Rip off!

OK, on to Live In Hong Kong. I nearly skipped this purchase after the terrible luck I had with them over the past decade. Glad I didn't. I have always been honest about Russell's voice as he obviously sounds nothing like he did. It's not his fault the man is in 60's and I never liked the fact that Graham took over lead singer over the last few albums, he certainly does have the voice to be the front man. It's obvious that they were using ""auto tune"" in this show because Russell sounded great. Now that comment is going to upset the Airheads (die hard fans) which I was one of till 2000. I hate to spoil the magic but Russell lip synched allot of concerts to vocals he prerecorded. This is why I stopped seeing them live.

But this show is different. They have top notch musicians backing them and they sounded fantastic. I liked the set list as it mixed things up a bit and this was definitely a rock show! There were 2 new songs included and of course the hits. Here were some pros of the show:

*The production was fantastic! Visually the HD was spectacular and 5.1 audio sounded awesome!
* Their band is outstanding and really added dimension to the show. So glad Graham added a lead guitarist a few years back, it brings the show to another level.
* Out of the 2 new songs "" Desert Sea Sky"" seemed absolutely out of place and was not very good but the brand new song ""I Won't Stop Loving You"" was quite enjoyable, one of there better songs they have done in some time.
* The set list included ""Goodbye"" which is think is their finest song (sadly left out of U S shows), really wish they would add more songs from The Vanishing Race to the set as I think it was by far their best record ever!

Bottom line, this is worth the money and I will admit a darn fine show! If your only going to pick up on live concert, this is the one to get!",1418947200,17,2408,4.205627705627705

6567554,5,B00MBJOKRW,"Great Great concert.  If you think Air Supply is soft and sleeper, think again.  The band that they have for live shows, is one of the top bands in my book.  All of their songs are arranged nicely with much more dynamic with live.  This is not to say that their awesome songs are so different from the original recordings.  The songs are still the same, just the energy that this band will rock you.

The audio from the first few songs were OK, the later was much better in terms of DTS-MA High-res goodness.  This was their first BD and I love love this live performance.  Check out their new drummer Aviv Cohen.  He is great.  Aviv, please use the sub-kick on your live shows.  Love the keyboard dude as well.  His piano sounds amazing.  Guitar and bass dudes are also great.

Over all, the live performance on this concert was great.  Production is something that can be worked on.  It seemed like it was recorded on the fly with no director or direction.  A local lady was brought up on stage with Graham was embarrassing.  You see, in live recording shows, you can't just say and do things you want.  You may think you are so funny at that moment but in reality, most are not.  Everything they say, move or act are always planned out in advance and rehearsed to death.  This show has none of that production quality.  This is why the directors make so much money 

Overall, love love Air Supply music with this band.  Forget what you heard on the radio in the 80s, these guys will rock you.  Thank goodness for great musicians and Air Supply.  And no, they are not gay.",1418428800,8,1574,4.356401384083045
6567555,5,B00MBJOKRW,"I know what your thinking...Air Supply?  They're still alive?  Not only that but this concert is absolutely amazing.  Hong Kong is apparently their second home for decades and they are in top form here.  Dare I say their voices sound BETTER than in their heyday, the young backup band rocks out, and no surprise to me is that the Hong Kong-produced sound is immaculate (if maybe a bit too clinical).  If they hit your town go see them!",1412035200,4,435,4.5256410256410255

6567625,1,B00MBJOKRW,"The only thing I found amazing about this performance is that it was released.  I should say that I enjoyed their music from the records released. Someone should have told them that there comes a time when a group needs to hang it up and find something else to do.  The lead singer was laughable in his performance because he would start to sing a phrase, stop and then motion to the audience to finish it for him. He did this over and over again to the point where I started looking hard to see it it may have been because he was drugged, confused, had forgotten the words or just wasn't physically able to finish the lyric.  The tempo of the songs seemed to have been slowed down to the point where the music was draggy.  I can say the HD picture and sound should have been used to catch the group when they were capable of doing a better performance instead of capturing them at perhaps one of their worst performances ever.  The facilities provided by Hong Kong to record the event were shocking sparse.  Lighting and other special effects to give the show some glitter and pizazz were missing to the point the audience appeared to have needed some strong coffee to keep them awake at least during the first portion of the show.  Someone who cares about the group should gather all the copies of this disc and destroy them if they care about how Air Supply will be remembered.  Very sad!",1421712000,,1391,4.40625

Well this is the closest thing to the real thing. Their performance was excellent and it had a rock concert feel to it. I really enjoyed this concert and if you are a Air Supply fan like I am, well I'm sure you will enjoy this live concert performance.",1492646400,,395,4.142857142857143
