3664108,3,B001KEGR7U,"I won't spoil the ending.

I think this film has one of the most clever premises I've seen in years: get a great actor who happens to have been in one of the Horror genre's most beloved film franchises (with lots of cult following) and make him play himself in a screenplay that jokes around him.

So here we find Bruce Campbell... the man... the myth... (laughs) who obviously saw the potential of the project and played along all the jokes, clich&eacute;s and stereotypes you can think of in a film like this.

Here's the storyline: in a small Oregon town, a boy who happens to be Bruce Campbell's biggest fan unlocks a Chinese ghost who starts haunting the town while killing anything that moves. Bruce Campbell - a run down 3rd rate actor living in a trailer - is kidnapped by the towns people who beg for his help (misguided by the notion that he can actually fight the evil forces). Thinking it is all a big joke by fans, Bruce plays along until he discovers the ghost is indeed real.

What I find most interesting is that Bruce Campbell plays a FICTIONAL version of Bruce Campbell... one whose career is a joke, who lives in a trailer and drinks bourbon from the dog's plate. In that sense, Bruce plays a fascinating (and hilarious) spoof on Hollywood Z-movie actors.

Most jokes are solid and delightful to watch although many moments get less laughs than I hoped.

The problem starts when the whole thing becomes too cartoonish that the whole screenplay derails into a final half hour that is a disaster unworthy of anything that came before. And that is sad because this whole project had everything to be a gem.

In my opinion, the problem is with the screenplay that obviously was not developed enough... the ending is everything an ending should NOT be... and it left me speechless since the film deserved a lot better.

Still, this is a film that is worth a look because it is always a joy to watch Bruce Campbell (who IS a great actor) joking about himself, his movies and Hollywood.",1232236800,3,1998,4.545961002785515

Bits and pieces (pardon the pun), pokes and prods of the best and worst of the Bruce Campbell legacy. There's a little something for everyone - eye candy for Bruce wanna-be's; quaint locales and characters for those who are into scenic adventure; comic creativity from the understated Ted Raimi; and a peek at the new shy side of an even sexier Campbell. It's painful to be given a sneek peek at something wonderful and then have to wait over a month to be able to own it, but pain is part of the beauty of a Campbell venture, isn't it?",1230768000,20,688,4.21969696969697

**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT**

I enjoyed this better than Bubba Ho Tep.
A review I read on the internet sums this movie up perfectly... It's the Galaxy Quest for Bruce Campbell fans.
Bruce pokes fun at everything in this film... his fans, himself, his movies, etc.  He even pokes fun at Ted Raimi's ""parts"" in Sam's movies, by having Ted play three different characters, and at least one of them dying the heaviest death scene in the film, which Sam always does to Ted.
If you are a die hard fan of Bruce, this is a must see.  Keep your eyes and ears open, there are a lot of little things (and people) put in this movie, to keep us on our toes.",1230681600,2,669,4.336
3664114,4,B001KEGR7U,"Bruce Campbell seems to have a kind of love/hate thing going with his fan base.  Sure, like any actor he enjoys having fans, but as he's stated in his book and elsewhere that his fans can get a bit outrageous and push things far.  This seems to be what sparked My Name Is Bruce.  Here he pokes fun at his fandom as well as his career.
In the film he plays Bruce Campbell, but a more fictional Bruce Campbell.  He's egocentric, a drunk, lives in a trailer, un-liked and un-respected by the cast and crew of his films, and just an all around jerk.  A teen in a small gold mining town called Gold Lick has mistakenly unleashed the ancient Chinese god of war, Guan-Di, and now the angry god is killing off the folks of Gold Lick.  The teen, Jeff, also happens to be a Bruce Campbell fanatic.  He manages to kidnap Campbell and bring him to Gold Lick where he has convinced the townspeople that Bruce will destroy the evil demon.  Bruce is under the impression that he's doing some kind of movie(it doesn't totally make sense why he'd think that he's in a movie when there's no film crew around or why the townspeople would believe that a horror movie actor could really be a ghost buster, but who cares?).  He goes coward when the reality of the situation becomes clear, but soon learns how to be the Bruce Campbell he's always portrayed himself to be.  I know what you're thinking!  My wife tapped my shoulder half way through the movie and said to me, ""this reminds me a lot of the Three Amigos"".  True, it's a very similar concept-the idea of egocentric actors finding themselves in real danger when they think they're only in ""reel"" danger, but in the end discover that they are heroes.
Needless to say it is a fun movie.  Naturally we're dealing with a comedy here, not a horror film.  While the laughs are hit and miss, some of them predictable and a bit cliched, this movie really works because of Bruce.  We all know that Bruce has a helluva screen charisma and can singlehandedly carry practically any movie just off of his charm.  He also directed this movie.  It's low budget of course, and Bruce certainly makes the best of that.  He built the town of Gold Lick on his own property in Oregon.  The supporting cast is decent too, mostly unknowns.  Ted Raimi has multiple roles, each a different nationality, allowing him try multiple accents.  His Asian character just isn't funny though.  Too much of a stereotype Chinese guy.  He reminded me of Mickey Rooney in Breakfast At Tiffany's.
It's great how Campbell makes fun of his fans and fandom, yet doesn't totally insult them.  He's also able to take potshots at himself and his career.  At one point he steals a kid's bike to get away from Guan-Di, and the kid yells at him, ""McHale's Navy sucked!!""  Funny stuff.  He really lays into his flop, Alien Apocalypse, but thinly disguises it here as a film called Cave Alien.  Plus there are many more in-jokes that you will definitely pick up on if you're familiar with many of Campbell's films.
Campbell is touring the country right at the moment showing the film and doing 20-30 minutes Q&A sessions after.  I'd highly suggest attending this if possible.  It's good support for Bruce as well as low budget cinema in general.  Plus the man is a treat to see and hear in person.  Just as funny and charming as you think he'd be.",1228348800,64,3334,4.495840266222961

3664215,4,B001KEGR7U,"I remember seeing a trailer for this movie back in 2009, but that was about it. Never saw it at the rental shops, and I'm pretty sure it never made its way through the theater circuit in my neck of the woods. And so, out of sight, out of mind. Then I found out my local library had a DVD copy and my interested was peaked yet again.

My Name Is Bruce is a self-deprecating action-comedy saturated in all the pulpy goodness for which Bruce Campbell is now legendary. Jeff, a teen Bruce-superfan in the tiny mining town of Goldlick, inadvertently unleashes an ancient Chinese god after removing a medallion from the old cemetery to impress a date. Oh, you teens. Is there an unholy terror you haven't unleashed during your midnight trysts?

To fight the demon, Jeff enlists his hero, Bruce. Well, he doesn't so much enlist. More like abduct. Bruce tricks himself into thinking it's a guerilla-style film project though, so instead of trying to call the cops, he treats it like improv. So while the entire town of Goldlick prepares for the fight of their lives, Bruce hams it up for cameras that aren't there, flirts with Jeff's mother, and marches off into the woods come nightfall with no idea there's a vengeful spirit waiting for him.

For a movie that was made for about a mil-and-a-half, the production value is really good. I guess it helps when you can use your own property as the studio lot. And the whole feel of the movie comes off like the cast and crew had a blast during the shooting of the film, despite all the headaches cataloged in the ""Making of"" featurette. Bruce is ... well, Bruce. Taylor Sharpe as Jeff and Grace Thorsen as his mother were quite likable--and convincing, which is such a welcome addition to a low-budge movie. And Ted Raimi hammed it up as he does best. Although, his role as the elderly Chinese miner, Wing, came off as uncomfortably racist at one point. Akin to those old Charlie Chan mysteries from nearly a century ago. Just eye-rollingly bad.

If your only familiarity with the Bruce is through his cameos in the Spider-Man flicks or his supporting role in Burn Notice, don't bother. You'd just be setting yourself up for a disappointment, I imagine. Anyway, the premise is super cheesy, but compared to some of the utter dreck Bruce Campbell has worked in (some of which he lampoons in this movie), My Name Is Bruce is cheesy with charm. And I believe there's even a sequel called Bruce Vs. Frankenstein supposedly in the works, if not already released.

What is disappointing first off is that the cast is beyond annoying.  I seriously want to punch the teenage kids in the face in this.  I realize they are supposed to be annoying teenagers, but they make you want to yell at the tv.  Secondly the story line of this is very dumb.  What were you thinking Bruce?  Bruce also doesn't have very many funny lines in this, which is odd for one of his movies.

I can honestly say the only part that was really funny in this is when a hooker comes up and demands money from him ""for services"" in front of a girl he is trying to date.",1421107200,,842,4.173913043478261

From being a alcoholic ready to drink out of his dog's bowl, living in a crappy trailer, having a terrible agent who is sleeping with his ex-wife, being an obnoxious a--hole, to psycho and ungrateful fans, this is the greatest caricature of a pathetic actor's life I've ever seen.

Guan-Di and the sacred bean curd aside, the movie makes numerous fun of both B movies, Bruce Campbell and so on. Don't take it serious, just lean back and relax. Like Spaceballs, it kind of has this sense of humour you can't get rid of :-). To top it off the special features show what happens when people REALLY have some fun with creating special features.

Since it's not a big, expensive production by Hollywood standards: I was a little concerned if the Blu-ray was worth it vs the DVD. The video quality is worth the extra couple bucks. Can't speak about the audio quality as I normally use headphones but no complaints. The video content is in H.264 at about 22 Mbit/s.",1386115200,2,873,4.416149068322981

3664274,4,B001KEGR7U,"This is a fun movie that makes no attempt to be anything other than a ""B"" movie, and I love Bruce for it. His Evil Dead and other such movies are bigger budget flicks, but this one was made on a pretty minimal budget. I've read that it was even shot on a set built on his own property, and he hired lots of locals for cast and crew. Pretty damn cool I say. It all seems to work here, and I mention the budget to set expectations, and not to detract from the movie otherwise. Bruce fans will enjoy it because of his many self-deprecating digs at himself, and they'll get the inside references to his past movies. ""Boomstick"", ""chainsaw"", ""blacksmith"", etc. all get worked into the movie. Viewers not familiar with his work should probably see, at least, ""Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army of Darkness"" movies before seeing this one. Otherwise, there's a lot here that will go over their heads. If you already dig Bruce, and all that encompasses, you'll ""get"" and enjoy this movie.",1373587200,,981,4.455555555555556

3664278,3,B001KEGR7U,"I""m a so-so fan of Bruce Campbell....he does some awesome work and I've enjoyed him in several movies and TV series (he's fantastic in Burn Notice, for example).  He's also done some stuff that isn't so excellent, and that's what THIS movie is a friendly spoof of.

Bruce Campbell plays himself here, as the only ""expert monster hunter"" a teen-aged fan of  his movies can think of to help their town battle an ancient curse.  He's a rather stereotypical and shallow guy in this movie, an over-the-top B-grade actor more interested in scoring than being responsible for anything.

It's a fun enough ride, a spoof of many of his B-grade movies with lots of inside jokes for the hard core B.C fans.  The special effects are schlocky but that's part of the charm and the spoof; it doesn't detract from the fun at all.

I do think that folks who are NOT Bruce Campbell fans won't really be terribly impressed or think much of the movie, but for those who are it's great fun.  Recommended for Bruce Campbell fans and anybody who enjoys campy ""horror"" movies.",1371859200,4,1052,4.618279569892473

The film is a comedy spoof of Bruce Campbell, his films, and fans. He is an obnoxious unlikeable character who lives in a trailer and is hated by his own dog. The film jests that all of his ""customer Amazon reviews are great"", spoofing the reviewers of his film. Grace Thorsen, a Catherine Zeta-Jones clone, is the leading lady.

3664310,4,B001KEGR7U,"I've been a fan of Bruce Campbell for over 20 yrs, I still remember taking my little kids to the VHS video rentals and first looking up his titles.  I'm now a grandfather and still enjoy his 3 series horror classics.  This movie was fun to watch if I didn't give it a five stars is because of these two annoying guys playing guitars in between scenes with a song about Guan Din, the Chinese God of War.

The whole concept of the idea is great.  As a fan I must congratulate Bruce for having the will power to take care
of himself physically after all these years.  A lot of middle age actors don't care about how they look in their middle age years
but Bruce hasn't changed much.

What I can't understand is why Hollywood producers didn't give him the break that he deserved in his younger years.  I mean here's a guy that looked better than most action heroes from the late eighties yet he ended up mostly with low budget productions.  I'm just glad he got his best break with Army of Darkness.

This movie is fun to watch and the effects are surprisingly great for having been shot in fairly confined area near his home
in Oregon.  If you're a real fan of Bruce, you have to watch this.",1356134400,2,1188,4.263392857142857

3664312,5,B001KEGR7U,"As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are ""alternative"" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!

It needs to be mentioned that in order to get maximum enjoyment out of this movie, you will probably need to be a fan of Bruce Campbell, widely considered to be the King of B-Movies. Otherwise, I'd imagine you might be quite confused. However, for those of us who ARE fans (and since this movie was not widely released, I'd imagine you know who he is if you've found ""My Name Is Bruce""), then this flick is a pure delight. It's hilarious to watch Bruce Campbell spoof on his own person, his bizarre (and very cool) career, and his legion of (oftentimes irrational) fans.

I had the opportunity to meet Bruce Campbell at an event at which he spoke, and he was the most patient, respectful, and down to earth gentlemen. His anecdotes were hilarious, his wit was sharp, and the way he dealt with his fans was admirable. ""My Name Is Bruce"" does a great job of paying homage to his career, while playfully spoofing at the perceptions that have slowly formed about him as the years pass by, his bio lengthens, and his legend grows.",1350777600,,1647,4.675862068965517
3664313,2,B001KEGR7U,"25 minutes into this flick, and I'm sorely tempted to bail. Calling it schlock is far too generous. What's offered up as humor is lame at best, with precious little best. The Concept of spoofing the spoof horror film genre is intriguing, but...

Just scanned the reviews before deciding whether to keep watching 'Bruce'.  Apparently there's nothing Campbell could say or do that wouldn't get a five star rating from his fan base, which is scary. OTOH, he seems personable and intelligent in real life, plus I like his taste in women, judging by those actresses seen so far. The 'ex-wife' was not only hot, but did fine work with the few lines she was given.

To press on, or not?

Okay, I'll give it to two stars. A  couple of running gags eventually grew mildly funny,  but mainly because the female lead and supporting actors made their characters interesting despite the negative waves Campbell incessantly radiated by ridiculing his onscreen persona (chugging urine, vigorous nose-mining), the movie, the genre, and by implication his hardcore fans - a fact lost on most of his hardcore fans, it seems.

As for the screenplay, even if time or money precluded anything more than minor alterations to the script in hand, there were tons of possibilities for improvements. A better option would have been to chuck that turkey whole hog, instead drawing from countless spec horror scripts, modified to fit the Concept. For instance, one of my screenplays that's been gathering dust for years, The Hoodoo, would have served well not only because it can be made CHEAP (seven character total), but is set in the Oregon Cascades, figuratively within sight of Campbell's Jacksonville ranch!",1350000000,,1685,4.953900709219858

If you have just crawled from the primordial pool, and are currently adjusting to your life as a biped with newly-evolved stereoscopic colour vision, and you have finally opted for lungs over gills, I forgive you.

Read on.

A note about the film's title. Reminiscent of William Shatner's ""Get a life!"" cry from the now-famous 1986 Saturday Night Live sketch, the title of this film was Campbell's way of teasing his fan-base about their relentless proclivity for referring to him as the character of Ash from his best-known performance in The Evil Dead Trilogy.

This was intended as both a playful rewording of the oft-quoted ""Name's Ash... Housewares!"" line from the third instalment,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Army-of-Darkness/dp/B0024FADDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Army of Darkness</a>, and a contentious statement of correction for the actor. The key difference between Shatner's breaking of the celebrity fourth wall, and Campbell's meta-fictional character in My Name is Bruce, is that our intrepid hero makes the insistence self-mockingly. Campbell has never completely turned his back on what made him popular, and begrudgingly accepts it without anything more vitriolic than a sigh, an eye-roll, and a shrug.

This is what makes him so compelling, and as a loyal fan (having gone so far as to watch Lois & Clark, suffer through 1997's remake of The Love Bug, and track down countless other B-Movies and television shows in which he has appeared), I can't help but smile every time he enters the frame. Bruce Campbell is a singular talent, and this movie is a showcase of his most endearing qualities.

My Name is Bruce is meant to be enjoyed as a bookend to his over-the-top performances in the B-Movies that created the persona the actor wears (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubba-Ho-Tep/dp/B0001LQJMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubba Ho-Tep</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-With-the-Screaming-Brain/dp/B000WC38F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man With the Screaming Brain</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sundown-The-Vampire-in-Retreat/dp/B001C0PFG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Apocalypse/dp/B000WC38FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Apocalypse</a>, or better yet, read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/his-first-autobiography/dp/0312242646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">his first autobiography</a>&nbsp;and then watch them). In all honesty, I can't fathom what this movie would look like to the uninitiated, but I liken it to subsisting on a diet of Dung Beetle larvae and Sunny D. In other words, it would be a poor substitution for living.

As always, I look forward to whatever roles The Bruce cares to indulge in, and I shamelessly expound his virtues to anything more civilized than a mung bean. If that's you, then take heed: watch some of the above-mentioned suggestions, and then buy this movie.",1315958400,,4300,7.432220039292731

3664323,4,B001KEGR7U,"There aren't a lot of horror comedies I can openly admit to really enjoying but very few can truly resist the charm of quite possibly the best B-actor to walk the face of the planet - Bruce Campbell. Honestly if you haven't seen the other major films Bruce has been in (The Evil Dead series) you may not yet be ready to watch this one. This film not only gives us Bruce in the starring role but also is directed by the man, the myth, the legend - Bruce Campbell. Yes he has learned the art of multitasking on this one and could only be better if it was written by none other than... Mark Verheiden. OK Bruce can do quite a bit but he doesn't do everything under the sun. Mark Verheiden has mainly written television shows until this point (aside from a small 90's comedy known as The Mask) but did such a great job Bruce signed him up for his next epic battle - Bruce Vs. Frankenstein. I for one after seeing My Name Is Bruce cannot wait for the next film they do together and with a title like that you know comedy gold will be in the works.

At any rate in this film Bruce Campbell plays - himself. Yes a run down B-Actor who is doing film after film of horrible movies with nowhere to go in life and running out of friends and jobs. Meanwhile in a small hillbilly town an ancient evil, Guan-Di (the Chinese God of War, protector of the dead, and bean curd) has been awakened and is terrorizing the countryside. No one is quite sure what to do but one of the town's inhabitants, Jeff (Taylor Sharpe), is a huge fan (stalker) of Bruce and believes that he is the only man capable of saving the town from the curse that has befallen it. Anyone who has been able to live through so many B-Movies has to know how to handle a real life situation of the same magnitude, right?

To get Bruce out there he kidnaps him and due to an entertaining set of circumstances (and Bruce being Bruce) he quickly believes that he is actually being hired to star in a new movie, not save a town from a monster that is real. We are introduced to the boy's mother where a love interest blooms between Bruce and Kelly Grahm (Grace Thorsen,) at least in Bruce's mind this is happening. When he realizes that the demon is actually real he responds in true Bruce fashion - he runs away as far and fast as he can.

Bruce never fails to delivery on entertainment. He has B-Movie campiness down to an art form and can fuse this talent into any genre. Gladly he has chosen to mix it with horror as it is non-stop laughs in a very twisted and self loathing kind of way. The movie also gets bonus points for casting Ted Raimi (Sam Raimi's brother) in 3 separate rolls within the film, each one of them more entertaining than the last. You really do need to have an interesting sense of humor to be able to enjoy such an abundant source of B movie madness.",1301875200,,2824,4.225925925925926
3664324,4,B001KEGR7U,"My Name is Bruce(with wide release in Oct/08),produced in cooperation with Dark Horse comics,is full of self deprecating comments like that one throughout its'86 minute run. In fact everyone gets a send up including people like you and me who review here on Amazon! That specific reference,like every other in this film,tells you never,but never,take yourself too seriously.
The film's plot has four kids out on a lark to a cemetery outside the backwoods mining town of Goldlick. One of the teens(Jeff)takes the protective marker off some wood around an entrance to a local mine. This unleashes Guan-Di,the spirit protector of 100 Chinese miners who perished long ago in an accident there. The scene shifts to Bruce on the set of his ""latest"" B(or C,or E,or....)film called Cavealien 2. Things are not going well and he gets spiffed and heads back to his home/trailer. With a knock on the door comes a bonk on the head and before he knows it Bruce is up in Goldlick to help save the town from Guan -Di,whose fave pastime is chopping the heads off anyone who comes within a few feet of him. Campbell is more than peeved at his kidnapping until he reasons it is all just a birthday joke set up by his agent. He plays along with the townsfolk until later he actually meets up with Guan-Di,mano et monster,and immediately retreats for all he's worth. He makes his way back to his trailer but gets a phone call from Jeff who is now taking on the demon by himself to save the town. Bruce has second thoughts,not to mention the guilt's,and hurries back to Goldlick. He meets up with Jeff's mother who didn't know about her son's plan,and which,by the way,spawns the title quote for this review. They both race to the graveyard and find Jeff. Working together to defeat Guan-Di they try and trap him in the mine again but just as they are walking away Guan-Di slips up behind them and the three simultaneously scream. The film stops and we are in a projection room where Campbell asks the makers if they can't have a happy ending for a change. The film runs a cheesy happy ending and as Bruce stands up applauding this change Guan-Di springs out of the screen,""heading"" for Bruce.
Like many other Campbell films Bruce has brought back a plethora of folks he has worked with many times over the years,to get this small budget film up and running. The stand out of course is Ted Raimi(Producer/Director Sam's brother).Ted is a triple threat here who plays an Italian sign painter,a local Chinese resident of Goldlick and Bruce's on-screen agent. I always love seeing Ted and he doesn't disappoint. Bruce is,well Bruce and his wise-acre,funny and self deprecating humour is in full throttle throughout. There are countless references both subtle and obvious to his past works. The obvious comes as Bruce enters Jeff's room who is a Campbell fanatic,which is filled with memorabilia. An example of less subtle is the name on the case of dynamite Jeff has in his trunk;""Hercules Dynamite""-referencing his work with his old cohorts Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert in TV's Hercules,starring Kevin Sorbo. Also  music meister supreme from Xena and Hercules,Joe LoDuca provides the music.
This DVD is chock full of extras which will thrill every Bruce Campbell fan to the nth degree. There is a making of featurette,movie commentary,featurettes on ""Bruce on..."",an inside the making of the Cavealiens 2 movie,""Kifs"" corner,awkward moments with ""Kif"",Love birds,the Hard Truth about Bruce,Cavealien 2 trailer,photo galleries of posters,props and movie photos. It is in its' original a/r of 1:78:1 and the picture is clean and crisp.
With plenty of laughs and Campbell's bravado on full tilt,this movie is a fun 86 minute romp that will you have you laughing out loud more than a few times. It's all tongue in cheek and with a HUGE poke at the movie industry itself,and alot of its' hanger-ons. The demon monster is wonderfully shot and realistic looking which adds an air of needed legitimacy to such films. Bruce Campbell fans rejoice,as your hero does it again.
P.S.By the way,Mr. Campbell? I can't get that @#$!! Guan-Di song out of my head now....thanks alot pally!",1301788800,,4146,4.8559322033898304
3664325,4,B001KEGR7U,"I love Bruce Campbell, AKA The Man.  I've been following his career ever since I traumatized my friends with a showing of the first Evil Dead (the one that's not nearly as funny as Evil Dead II and kind of squicky). We watched Evil Dead II and went to the movies to see Army of Darkness.  We were very confused because the tone shifted from one of disturbing horror to slapstick humor to total comedy.  And thus we were indoctrinated into what The Man does best: slapstick horror.

On the DVD of Army of Darkness, Campbell shares his thoughts on Ashley Williams, the hero of the series and Campbell's alter ego.  He wanted him to hide in a closet at the end of the film, revealing that he was really a coward.  Campbell never had much respect for Ash, but the character has been conflated with the actor on more than one occasion. If you've read If Chins Could Kill, you know that Campbell's a working actor whose pay doesn't exceed $80K most years - although I hope that's changed since his debut on the excellent Burn Notice.  My Name is Bruce combines the Man, the Myth, and the Legend into one hilariously self-referential movie.

The Bruce Campbell of My Name is Bruce is a boozy, womanizing no-talent hack who hates his coworkers, his fans, and life in general. In other words, he's Ash at the end of Army of Darkness.

The Raimis have always had a fondness for Asian cinema and the Asian influence extends even to My Name is Bruce in the form of Guan-Di, the Chinese god of war and bean curds.  Campbell is suckered into visiting the town threatened by Guan-Di, thinking it's a birthday present from his agent (Ted Raimi).  I'll be honest...I love Bruce, but I could really do without Ted.  Ted's the younger Raimi brother who's always tagging along.  While I have enormous respect for the literal horrors he faced in making Evil Dead II, Ted just isn't as talented as Bruce.

In the midst of the endless in-jokes about Campbell, it becomes obvious that he is the best actor on the set.  Campbell has movie star charisma even if his movies aren't always up to snuff, and never has it been more abundantly clear that the man has talent than this ironic taken down of himself. The other actors just can't keep up - and in Ted's portrayal of an Asian, borders on offensive.

The ending isn't really an ending so much as it's a meta-critique of movies in general.  Bruce directed this film so he can end it however he wants, and it ends just as he likes it - crazed, absurd, and violent.  If you're a fan of The Man this is a must see.",1294963200,,2538,4.421505376344086
3664326,2,B001KEGR7U,"Yeah I know it's ""sugar"", but watching this movie is like eating a cake baked with salt instead of sugar.  I like Bruce Campbell, I smile everytime I see him in a film, on a T.V. show or in a commercial.  He makes me laugh with his wisecracking humor and he's been in the type of B-movie guilty pleasures I'll always overrate thanks to his presence.  The Evil Dead films happen to be some of my favorite horror films ever, particularly the second one which he played a large part in making special.  Army of Darkness is a laugh riot goof ball comedy and no matter what his critics may say, I do feel he has plenty of acting ability to pull off more dramatic roles.

Having said all that, I don't like this movie.  It tries too hard to be funny and I think they approached it the wrong way.  There was no need to make a spoof of Bruce Campbell or his films since so many of his films intentionally cast him knowing they are spoofing themselves.  This movie is the equivalaent of someone repeating a joke after everyone has already laughed at it, and then laughing at their own joke.  It just didn't work for me overall, it would have made a much better short or a series of quick internet webisodes.

Obviously every Bruce Campbell fan should check this out, I mean if you sat through Alien Apocalypse just for Bruce Campbell, then you can definitely make it through this.  You may find it funny, humor is subjective, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  I think if Bruce Campbell were going to spoof himself, it would have been funnier if they didn't use the whole supernatural element.  Just have him be that wise cracker ""Ash"" in everyday life, telling off Hollywood Execs, hitting on young drunk celebrities, punching out the paparazzi and ordering his legion of fans to take out Shatner's legion of fans.  Had they approached this the same way Bob Sagat makes fun of ""himself"" in Entourage it would have been true comedy gold.

The movie didn't do it for me, I got all the jokes since I am a diehard Campbell fan but they still flat, but I still say hail to the King.",1294358400,,2076,4.369791666666667

3664330,2,B001KEGR7U,"I bought this along with the action figure.  The action figure cost about 15 - 20 times what this movie cost; staring at the figure on my shelf for 1.5 hours provides just as much entertainment value as the dvd.

Bruce has some fun at his own expense- but as a director...no.  Oh no no no.  He should have cut off the hand that held the megaphone into which he yelled ""All quiet on the set, aaaaand, speed!"", and perhaps replaced it with a chainsaw or something else more appropriate to his skill set.

Love his acting, hate his directing.  Take Bubba Ho Tep and make it even more dull.  That's ""My Name is Bruce.""  And I kind of like BHT.

So, I put this movie next to my 3 ""Evil Dead"" movies, and my BHT movie.

3664349,3,B001KEGR7U,"First, I'm a big Bruce Campbell fan, having enjoyed him in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, ""Brisco County"" and ""Burn Notice,"" among many others notable and not-so-notable.  Second, Campbell's book, ""If Chins Could Kill,"" was great, providing juicy low-budget movie-production tidbits along with Campbellian humor.  That being said, let's get to the movie.

The movie was entertaining and served, basically, as a vehicle through which to view Bruce doing his usual thing: delivering snappy lines, making funny faces, being rejected by women, making a low-budget movie.  All good stuff.

All in all, though, the movie is just okay, enjoyable for one-time viewing on a late night.  I mean, they have him living in a trailer in the movie and any fan of Bruce Campbell's KNOWS that THAT isn't true, which really shouldn't matter but, somehow, it does, thereby undermining the credibility of the storyline (not that it's that credible to begin with, mind you).  It's a decent romp, but not one of Bruce's best efforts by a longshot.

Also, the ending could have been much better, e.g. filled with corny Campbell lines and romantic pleas.

3664354,4,B001KEGR7U,"I love America earnestly, and admit this without embarrassment or reluctance.  I even proudly served in our nation's armed forces out of a sense of patriotic calling.  Though I realize that our country is not perfect, just as no nation or society inhabited by fallible humans can achieve perfection in the practice of its principles or execution of its laws.  Nonetheless, I truly believe this is one of the few societies in this world's history that where noble aspirations for governance have been successfully (though not perfectly) established to ensure freedom and stability - and the U.S. is still the one with the best track record.

That having been said, if I were to list the things about American society that I am least fond of, one of them is the fetish that a large portion of the population has with low-grade worshipping of celebrity pop ""culture"" (an ironic and oxymoronic phrase).  To be obsessed about which `celebrity' (an arbitrary, nebulous, loosely defined, often temporary, and ultimately insubstantial designation) is dating whom, or preoccupied about the status of a celebrity's marriage, or to be keenly interested about their mundane and tedious activities is a reliable indication of the banality of one's own existence.  Furthermore, the dubious standard for obtaining celebrity status is both becoming much easier and much less meaningful.

Even more astonishing is the thorough extent to which these unremarkable vessels of self-promotion and mediocrity actually take themselves seriously.  Even on those rare occasions when celebrities `deign' to allow a feebly satirical portrayal of themselves, it is still limited to the narrow and vacuous limitations that their conceit and vanity permit, rather than an earnest or bold or creative bit of self-effacing humor.

That is not to say that there aren't some celebrities who don't take themselves too seriously, and have a solid sense of humor to prove it.

A case in point:

The Mrs. and I rented MY NAME IS BRUCE this past weekend.  It is a scathing yet rather amusing self-parody starring and directed by none other than cult-favorite icon himself: Bruce Campbell.  It is remarkable in the humorously unflattering portrayal of the film's protagonist and principle lead - which are the same person.  What makes this work so effectively is Campbell's having the sense of humor and robust self-esteem (without seemingly being overwhelmed by the mound of insecurities which seems to accompany and define the caricature of pop culture ""celebrity"") that enable him to make fun of himself in such an effective and entertaining manner.  It is a brutally fictitious (hopefully) satire which depicts Campbell as a third-rate screen hack and a thoroughly dysfunctional egomaniac whose personal life is an utter mess and whose everyday existence is depicted as a glib version of one of Dante's circles.

THE PLOT: While Bruce is filming a remarkably bad low-budget sci-fi film (even by Bruce's own undemanding standards), a homicidal demon is released into a small Oregon town by teenaged shenanigans.  One of said teens is a completely devout Bruce Campbell fanatic whose idolization borders on obsession.

Getting it in his head that Bruce Campbell's on-screen persona would translate into real-life heroics, the teen convinces the town that Bruce is the only hope they have of saving themselves from the demon's murderous wrath.  Thinking it's some kind of a gig, Bruce shows up (not entirely voluntary) and is treated like minor royalty by the townspeople who, unbeknownst to Bruce, expect the irritatingly entitled and obnoxiously aloof actor to save them and their town. (END of PLOT SUMMARY)

Though the Mrs. and I are choosy about comedies and I am not an easy laugh, we had (guardedly) optimistic expectations about enjoying the film.  As it turned out, this movie was even funnier than we thought it would be!  There are several Laugh-Out-Loud moments throughout the film, which may be destined for an esteemed place in the pantheon of cult filmdom (it could happen).

MY NAME IS BRUCE is purposely done as a bad cheap low-budget movie to mirror Campbell's life with that of his filmwork.  It has some cartoonish violence (no explicit gore) and some language that might make it a better film to watch when the little ones aren't in the room, but otherwise is a lot of laughs.  It's one of the most entertaining films we have seen in quite a while.  Even the Special Features have some humorous and interesting material.  In fact, watching the behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of the film is actually more interesting and entertaining than some films I can think of.

Granted, this movie may not be for everyone.  The demographic is somewhat easily defined.  In fact, the young woman working the register at Blockbuster where & when we rented the film told us she didn't like the movie, but that's because clearly she was mentally ill.  She also said that she didn't even like ARMY OF DARKNESS at all.  How disturbed is she???

Nonetheless, if you're the kind who would consider renting or watching this film in the first place, it's a fair to good bet that statistically you will most likely enjoy the film.  And darn it, that's your right as an American!",1255305600,,5251,5.046349942062572

1. Bruce Campbell - The worst movie in the world would get bumped up a star just because Bruce Campbell is in it.  There is just something about Bruce that makes a stupid line in a stupid movie fun to watch.

2. Grace Thorsen - Who the heck is she?  That is what I said, especially when she took off her apron for the dance scene.  She bumped the movie up TWO stars.

3. The special features, all of them, are fun and funny!  I'd go so far as to say the the special features are maybe even better than the movie... and they are just about as long as the movie.  This bumps the movie up another star.

So, you do the math.  4 stars rating and all 4 stars are accounted for in the previous 3 items.  I guess that means the actual movie comes in at zero stars, but who cares.  It was fun.  I have suspicions that Bruce Campbell made this movie just to put a paycheck into the pockets of the 36 or so friends of his who were involved in making it and to have fun in his back yard during his time off from Burn Notice.

The acting is a little off, most notably the kid, but that's all right this is not an Oscar contender by any means.

Great plot, although very silly; this story could not have fit anyone other than Bruce Campbell himself.

The Blu-ray mastering isn't too super, as the compression is evident in dark foggy scenes. The audio is top-notch though. Despite all of this, the Blu-ray version is still very much worth watching because it is so much fun.

Three stars as a product. I recommend ""My Name is Bruce"" to any fan of gruesome, classic, monster-style thrillers. Lots of fun, without milking the clock.",1249171200,,722,4.6171875
3664373,4,B001KEGR7U,"Last night I had the privilege of seeing My Name is Bruce. Mr. Campbell was actually at the theatre to help promote the film. As a longtime Bruce fanatic I was overcome with child-like giddiness when he came out to answer questions. The man is THE definition of cool. If you ever have the chance to meet him do yourself a favor and go, you will not be disappointed!

My Name is Bruce revolves around the plot that an accidentally awakened Chinese Demon is about to murder all the residents of a tiny Oregon town. A young teenager has convinced the authorities that their only hope is legendary B-Movie Star Bruce Campbell. It's completely ridiculous and an absolute riot at the same time. The main gag is that Bruce isn't a super cool, outgoing and appreciative movie star; rather he is a womanizing, drunken, cowardly douche-bag.  Oh, and he has no clue that the Demon is real and not some elaborate ruse set up by his agent.

Bruce plays ""himself"" way over the top and its pure joy to witness. It goes without saying that if you even remotely enjoy Campbell, you will love this film.  From the director's chair, Campbell melds the slapstick horror humor of Army of Darkness with the brutal beheadings of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. My Name is Bruce is more funny than scary, but really the film is just a vehicle to allow fans to relish in the greatness of Campbell. Even though he runs the gamut of deplorable acts it's still easy to love him! Bruce eventually has a ""coming of age"" moment though it's still not that profound (and he remains a cantankerous scumbag pretty much till the bitter end). As an added treat you get not one, but three separate roles from the always dependable Ted Raimi. Sure goofy sound effects and hammed up acting normally make a movie unwatchable, but in this case it all adds to the campy charm. Experiencing this in a theatre packed with Campbell fanatics was merely icing on an already deliriously scrumptious cake.

Preposterous, outlandish and absurd...these are all words that perfectly exemplify My Name is Bruce. Honestly, it's actually a compliment since that is exactly what the film-makers set out to create. Bruce Campbell's life and career IS absurd and ludicrous, so a movie about it would certainly need to dial it up to eleven. I could have used a little more gore, and perhaps a new Campbell catchphrase. Regardless, this coupled with Bubba Ho Tep proves that Bruce Campbell is still at the top of his game. Hail to the King, baby.

3664375,4,B001KEGR7U,"Bruce Campbell is a national treasure even if most of the nation doesn't know who he is despite appearing in all three Spider-Man movies (granted he played three different characters). But he was part of my formative years thanks to Army of Darkness and The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. Really, if the MTV Movie Awards were still hip and relevant, they would have giving him, or at the very least Ash, the Lifetime Achievement Award.

It is the cult like following that is the basis of My Name Is Bruce where Campbell plays the title character, himself. His exaggerated version of himself is a callow, egomaniacal hack who is hated by his co-workers, his ex-wife, and his agent (Ted Raimi in one of his three roles). The only people that don't hate him are his legions of fans, but he's working on alienating them too. But it is one zealous fan who just so happened to unleash the Chinese war deity Guan Di that figures the one person that could help him would be the star of Evil Dead and Maniac Cop 2.

But when the fan kidnaps Campbell, he goes along with it thinking it is an acting gig set up by his manager. And then the hilarity ensues. One drawback of My Name Is Bruce is the fake real life Bruce doesn't exactly live up to the humor or wit of his onscreen version like Ash. And you wish for more catchphrases that you come to expect from Bruce characters. But this movie makes up for it in the terms of musical numbers and has plenty of in-jokes for the hard core Bruce fans and a few cameos from Evil Dead alums.

The big draw to the My Name Is Bruce DVD are the extra like the behind the scenes documentary that is almost as long as the movie itself. There is also a behind the scenes look at the movie within a movie that Bruce is filming, as well as a trailer for the fake flick included.",1246320000,3,1804,4.284457478005865
3664386,4,B001KEGR7U,"MY NAME IS BRUCE is exactly what Bruce Campbell fans would expect it to be, but with perhaps a bit more vulgar language included. Having read the Dark Horse comic book that was created to parallel it, I wasn't expecting much--the humor in the film relies completely on the delivery of its hero the one and only Bruce Campbell, which is something that simply doesn't translate to the printed word.

The plot is simple: teenagers accidentally raise the Chinese god of war (and bean curd) Guan Di and one of them (a devout fan of Campbell's) decides to enlist him to battle the monstrous killing machine and when Campbell isn't interested, the teenager kidnaps him. Campbell thinks its all part of an elaborate birthday present from his agent (played by Ted Raimi), sort of a chance to live out his screen persona in a role playing game, and decides to go along with the gag and have some fun. He quickly learns that this Monster is all too real and he runs for his life leaving the town in the lurch and his teenaged fan disillusioned. Will Campbell turn out to be a cad or will he become a REAL life and not just a REEL life hero?

Campbell (who made his directorial debut in THE MAN WITH THE SCREAMING BRAIN) is also at the helm in this flick which was written by Mark Verheiden of Dark Horse Comics and he does it with surprising panache. He is not the least bit reticent about portraying the fictional Bruce Campbell as a washed up 3rd rate actor who's an alcholic, womanizing, creep with little respect for himself or anyone else for that matter. The special features on the DVD are even better than the film itself and are totally enjoyable. This is a must for every Bruce Campbell fan.

Think 'Three Amigos' meets 'Evil Dead,' complete with Bruce's classic one-liners.  Bruce Campbell is playing an actor named, um, Bruce Campbell who makes generally low-budget movies about fighting aliens and zombies. A super-fan accidentally unleashes a real-life demon and Bruce Campbell is his town's only hope.

The movie doesn't try to be anything more than it is, and that just adds to the fun. Bruce plays up the slapstick and a lot of the dialogue is designed to either: a) elicit some snarky remark from Bruce, or b) lead to Bruce getting clobbered over the head/thrown across a room/slapped in the face. Or a combination of both. The violence is over-the-top, with extra helpings of gore. And Bruce pulls off the reluctant hero perfectly, like always.

The special features add to the fun. There are candid interviews with Bruce Campbell and a basic how-to to making your own movie.  Not only is there an in-depth ""Making Of"" and Video Diary, but there are also a fake trailer and 'Making Of' for the low-budget movie that (the character) Bruce is filming called ""CaveAlien 2.""

3664421,5,B001KEGR7U,"This (movie) is what you think it is. If you are a fan of Bruce Campbell. If you always stop as you're channel surfing whenever ""Army of Darkness"" is on. If you watch ""Burn Notice"" as much for BC as for everyone else in the cast - yes, incluing Gabrielle Anwar. If you miss ""Brisco County, Jr."" and have been thinking, ""Damn, why don't I just go ahead and by the series on DVD, already?!"". Then this little treat is PERFECT for you.

It's funny, over-the-top, references all (or at least 90%) of your BC favorites, has some Fake Shemps, and at about $20 is a good value as any American can find nowadays.

It's much better than ""The Man with the Screaming Brain"" - yes, I actually did see that in a theater (BC was there for a book signing...and maybe I was drunk...that's all I'm gonna say, so drop it).

Want some artsy film? Look elsewhere. Want a movie about two cowboys in love? Or some long-lost lovers reunited after being separated during a war? Well. I think the Lifetime Channel is playing your song, Nancy Boy.

So, while the world around us is rapidly going to Hell in a handbasket and the Feds are blowin' through your grandkid's incomes like a bunch of drunken sailors, set yourself down, grab a beer (or 20) and lose yourself in BC's world.

3664426,2,B001KEGR7U,"Bruce Campbell is one of the few actors who really knows how to handle a B-Movie formula well. He knows when to play it seriously and when to inject tongue in cheek humor. He's the kind of actor who can effortlessly steal and/or make many a bad film. In this self produced parody of himself, Bruce yet again, is very enjoyable and able to deliver the laughs, but never rises above the material.

The plot is about how Bruce, playing himself, is kidnapped by a crazy young fan who wants him to protect his town from an ancient demon. Bruce thinks it's a joke until he comes face to face with the Monster and turns tail, only to come back and predictably take the creature on. It's very reminiscent of the film,""Galaxy Quest"", except unlike that film, this one loses focus pretty early on.

Campbell's character is a gross parody of himself and is made out as an arrogant, loveable jerk. The problem is that he never believably progresses throughout the course of the picture. The climatic encounter with the main demon does not even take place until the final half hour(!) and than he returns in the last fifteen minutes to battle the demon, and never is is believable that he got to that point as a character because Bruce is playing a CARIACTURE. Now perhaps this is missing the point, but it seems a shame that the film could not go beyond the films it's parodying, becoming yet another movie where Campbell is the only thing going for it, everything else failing miserably. That's the problem here. It never becomes anything else than just another B-movie. And what a shame!

The DVD features are fairly entertaining including mock trailers for the film within a film, ""Cavealien 2"" which is funny and some behind the scenes footage of Bruce that is very humorous. There's even a documentary about the film.

It's a harmless enough movie and a must for B-movie and Bruce fans everywhere(areen't they one in the same?) and well worth a viewing, but does not stand up under multiple viewings like the best B-movies.

Note:Ted Raimi is in this. Of course. And in at least three roles. Awesome.",1237075200,,2093,4.630727762803234

3664428,5,B001KEGR7U,"""My Name is Bruce"" portrays Bruce Campbell at his worst, which is to say, his best, and in doing so, salutes his fans who venerate him.

Teenage vandals have unintentionally loosed a Chinese spirit-demon upon the tiny mining town of Gold Lick, Oregon. Gung-di, god of the dead and bean curd, is lopping off heads left and right. A desperate fan then kidnaps the only man brave and strong enough to stop this monster, B-movie star Bruce Campbell.

Bruce is filming his newest movie, ""Cave Alien 2,"" worrying about his future as an actor, and pining over his divorce. Only when discovering Gung-di is real does he develop into a true hero, sort of.

You have to know Bruce's work to understand the movie. If nothing else, see the Evil Dead trilogy and Bubba Hotep. Seeing Bruce on the set of Cave Alien 2 and getting beset by the fanboys is worth it just in itself.

""Gimme some sugar, baby!"" a set worker taunts him. ""Gimme a lemon water!"" he snaps back. Bruce portrays himself as a selfish, drunken dimwit, quite different from the likable, charming, and self-effacing actor I met on Halloween 2001. He seemed geninuely flattered when I told him my girlfriend and I would name our second son Ash in his honor. (My wife has since recanted on this, when she discovered that's where it came from.)",1236556800,,1294,4.613043478260869

3664430,4,B001KEGR7U,"For hardcore horror fans and fans of b-movies in general, Bruce Campbell is a man who needs no introduction.  Mostly known for the Evil Dead trilogy and Bubba Ho-Tep, his other films have been mostly forgettable b-movies but he has developed into one of the biggest cult actors of all-time.  If you've already read his autobiography ""If chins could kill"" and feel like you need even more Bruce, this movie will be a godsend.

Plot: A group of teenagers, among them one who is a hopeless Campbell fanatic, unwittingly unleash an evil spirit, after messing around in a graveyard at night.  Turns out they have unleashed Gu-An Di, an ancient Chinese protector of the dead.  The small town of Gold Lick is thus under the hold of this ancient evil.  So who do they call for help?  Well, Bruce Campbell of course.  Yes, the real Bruce Campbell!  But as the town folk will soon find out, the real Bruce Campbell is not quite as adept with a ""Boomstick"" as he is in his films.

It seems like Bruce, who happens to also be the director of this film, is taking a special pleasure in not only mocking himself, but also his obsessive fanbase as well.  In this film, he makes his fans out to be as obsessive and abhorrent as the worst of the Star Trek fanatics can be.  When this film is funny, it's really funny.  Bruce is in fine comic form throughout.  But in typical B-Movie fashion, when this movie tries to be funny but fails (usually scenes that do not have Bruce in it) it falls flat on its face.

It's a bit hard to give a ranking to a film like this.  Should I rank this as a Bruce Campbell fan, or on its own merits as a stand-alone movie?  I opt for the former because I figure Campbell fans are basically the only ones that would seek this out anyway.  For his fans, this has it all: Campbell playing an exaggerated version of himself as a trailer-park, divorced, boozing, sleazy and jerk womanizer who spits out the cheesy lines we've all gotten so used to hearing from him.  On the other hand, if you don't know who Campbell is, then stay far away.  The only reaction you'll get is:  WTF?  And I don't mean that in a positive way.",1236124800,2,2132,4.3578680203045685
3664431,5,B001KEGR7U,"If you have seen Bruce's catalog of B-movie films, then you know he is the epitomy of the hilarious, tongue in cheek, action star.  This one ranks right up there as Bruce skewers himself along with the films he's made.  I was fortunate to see this on Bruce's tour and loved it as did everyone.  Of course, Bruce also skewers us, his fans, in this as well.  But all in good fun and at the end of the day, we all wish we were Bruce Campbell.  This was good, but a movie version of ""Make Love, The Bruce Campbell Way"" would be better than Ben ""frickin"" Hur.  But Bruce doesn't want to make it, says it can't be done.  We will wear him down, oh yes, we will wear him down.  You hear me Bruce?  We're coming for you.",1235952000,,711,4.057553956834532

I really loved how the whole story is basically him making a parody of himself. In that the story is genius. But I can't see many non-Bruce fans liking this one. I think Bruce is awesome. I even own Bubba-Ho Tep on DVD (I almost fell out of my chair laughing when the kid has the Bubba-Ho Tep shirt on and also during the scene in the car when they talk about it). But I also know that it takes a special kind of taste to enjoy this type of humor. I won't talk about the story since that's already been done here a lot. I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys Bruce and the kinds of movies like Bubba-Ho Tep and Army of Darkness. The cheese factor is off the charts here.

3664455,4,B001KEGR7U,"I feel kind of funny posting a positive Amazon review for a film that mentions this site by name and suggests that all of the positive reviews for Bruce Campbell's movies were plants; like I'm asking for abuse or something.  ""My Name Is Bruce"" is not to be taken as a serious film in any way.  In fact, if you are capable of seeing Bruce Campbell's name on a film and then not seeing it, you will probably hate this movie.  This is nothing more than a satirical tribute to a well-loved B-movie star who never got his due from anybody but the dozens of raving lunatics the man calls fans.  It's an intoxicatingly amusing cocktail of narcissism and self-deprecating masochism filled with godawful Z-grade effects, borderline racist caricatures (okay, outright racist caricatures), cheesy genre cliches, incessant hammery, and so many blatant winking references that your eyes will start to hurt after the first 15 minutes.  But it's BRUCE!  BRRRUUUUCCCCE!!!!  What can I say?  Like William Shatner and Adam West, the man is made almost entirely out of awesome.

As I said, not a second of this movie can be taken seriously.  It was obviously a tongue-in-cheek labor of love by the fans, for the fans even though it was Campbell himself who took the reins as director.  And naturally, he is the best (only) reason to see this film.  Whether he's lapping booze from a dog bowl while scoffing at his ex-wife's labeling him as pathetic, shoving a rude wheelchair-bound fan into traffic, considering the services of the transgender hooker his agent (played by Ted Raimi) got him for his birthday, or just generally acting like the biggest D-bag on the face of the earth, ""the greatest actor of his generation"" mugs at the camera and dares you not to laugh.  Toss in some Deliverance and Brokeback Mountain references (getting old, but still good for a chuckle), plenty of decapitations by a Chinese god of bean curds, and a clumsy ""romance"" with a spectacularly bouncy country girl and you've got an entertaining (almost) 90 minutes. Then there's the folk-music interludes singing the story of the villain, Guan-Di, who battles Campbell after the actor is kidnapped by a fan and tapped to defend a small town from the rampaging demon.  It's all so ridiculous one can't help but have a good time.  And you've got love the quickie Q&A when Bruce meets some of his adoring fans.  Q: ""Did working with Ellen turn you gay?""  A: ""No, but your stupid question did.""  Just another day in the life of an entertainment genius.

While I can appreciate the carelessness, Z-grade quality, and lack of political correctness MNIB so proudly displays, I have to point out a pet peeve of mine.  It's Asians or other minority characters being portrayed by white actors.  It just bugs me.  And when the character is a buffoonish stereotype, all the worse.  Not that I didn't snicker at Ted Raimi dressed as an old Chinese man accosting Bruce's ""engrish"", but I do feel that it was wholly unnecessary and more than a bit racist. It's just not a good look.  And this is coming from a guy with a massive tolerance for tongue-in-cheek racism.  But then again, in a movie so insistent that it not be taken seriously that it mocks it's own ending (if you can even call it that) then I can forgive.  Oh, Bruce; you know I can't stay mad at you.

As a Bruce Campbell tribute/roast, MNIB is a must-see to the fans.  It's not a great film, but you should certainly give it some sugar, baby. There are several extras including an hour-long making-of feature with the genius title of ""Heart of Dorkness"".  There is also about 4 minutes of behind-the-scenes inanity from the man of the hour (and a half) featuring Bruce on cougar attacks, Bruce flipping off the camera, and other bits that will leave you wondering ""how hard up were they for bonus materials?"".  And let us not forget the added features for the fictional (I hope) ""Cave Aliens 2"" which is the film Bruce is shooting in the film.  I would have wished for a better tribute to a man who has brought me so much joy, but somehow an inept B-movie just seems like the only way to go.

3 1/2 stars rounded up because it's Bruce fu@%ing Campbell.",1235779200,,4164,4.646174863387978
3664456,4,B001KEGR7U,"- A character in this film: ""Bruce Campbell is the greatest actor of his generation!""

You have to be a fan of the dude. Because, to anyone else, MY NAME IS BRUCE probably comes off a lame picture. But if you're in on the joke, then trashy campy fun time could be had. Skewering his B-movie street creds as he does, Bruce Campbell in this movie isn't about to go all Denzel or Sir Laurence Olivier. He's the same goofy wiseacre action hero, and impeccable acting doesn't fly out the window as much as it is defenestrated.

The Chinese believe there is a god of everything. In the dying mining town of Gold Lick, Oregon (population 339, and fast declining), teenagers prowl a decrepit graveyard and unwittingly set loose the murderous hellspawn Guan-Di, who has ties to the one hundred Chinese miners who back in the 1870s perished in a mine shaft collapse. This being that kind of movie, Guan-Di, who is the Chinese God of War, the Protector of the Dead, and the Patron Saint of Bean Curd, is rendered so very cheesily on screen that there's no way he could scare anyone. Still, the demon doesn't waste time going on a killing spree, chopping off heads, rapidly reducing Gold Lick's population like it was Bruce Campbell's dignity. Desperate times call for blah blah blah. One teenager has seen all of Bruce Campbell's mostly schlocky flicks and a lightbulb comes on.

So, apparently, in ""real life,"" Bruce Campbell is mean, bitter, boozy, lily-livered and dwells in a ramshackle trailer. And he treats his fans worse than Shatner treats Star Trek enthusiasts. Fresh off shooting scenes for CAVEALIEN 2 and quaffing down urine, Bruce is talked into helping out the hapless folks of Gold Lick, if by ""talked into"" it's meant that he gets bonked on the head, dumped in the trunk of a car and shanghaied to Gold Lick to play savior. Once there, Bruce gets his wires crossed and, stemming from a conversation with his agent, assumes that this whole mess is play acting put on for his birthday. So Bruce goes along, preening and lording it over the small town rubes and waxing rhapsodic on his demonslaying skills. Until he learns that Guan-Di is an honest-to-gosh demon who doesn't give a fig about his birthday.

So it's a slim to none shot that the high-falutin' folks from Merchant Ivory will call for Bruce Campbell's services any time soon, even if Bruce does look damn dashing in those Old Spice ads. MY NAME IS BRUCE is more in his wheelhouse, just the type of thing to make his fans happy, and it probably doesn't matter too much to them that this film doesn't rise above its genre, is in fact steeped in cheesy horror cliches, beginning with the one about the randy teens (a.k.a. soon-to-be-victims) angling for booty call. This film really does ride on the strength of the fans' long-standing affection for the mighty-chinned one. MY NAME IS BRUCE features a Bruce Campbell who slings profanity and shamelessly insults everyone, and because it's this guy who's mugging on camera, I relish it. Regarding the portrayal of his pathetic ""real life"" self, he out Bob Hopes Bob Hope in terms of yellow-streaked shenanigans and snarky meta-referential barbs. It's totally un-p.c. but I couldn't help laughing when Bruce's bump of self-preservation has him wrestling old ladies out of cars and shoving little kids off their bicycles.

Not to be taken too seriously, the dvd's bonus features are: the feature commentary with Bruce Campbell (who also directed the movie) and producer Mike Richardson; ""Heart of Dorkness"" - the hour-long Making Of featurette; 2 awkward conversational moments with 'Kif' (Craig 'Kif' Sanborn is the film's associate producer); Bruce On... - Bruce waxes philosophical on sundry (and uninteresting) topics: wildlife, budgets, etc.; a fake trailer to CAVEALIEN 2; Beyond Inside the Cave: The fake Making Of featurette on CAVEALIEN 2; Kif's Korner - Kif chats about the film's graphic artwork, mostly concerning the posters promoting Bruce's fake films within the film; the Hard Truth - a playful expos&eacute; on What Bruce Is Really Like (or as one crew member says: ""I don't know what Bruce is like off-set. I could ask my wife.""); Love Birds - a minute spent with the hick farmer and his gunshop owner ; Poster Art Gallery; Props Art Gallery; Photo Gallery; and the MY NAME IS BRUCE trailer. There's also a mini comic book adapted from the movie.

If you've enjoyed Bruce Campbell in his other roles (Ash, Bubba Ho-tep, Autolycus: King of Thieves, Brisco County, Jr., etc.), this is simply more of the same antics. But the extra fun here is in catching all the in-jokes and references. So keep the tongue planted firmly in cheek and go fix yourself a ham and cheese sandwich - but heavy on the ham! - as a seedy, jerky B-movie icon learns valuable life lessons about decency, respect and even love - that is, when he's not weaseling and yellow-bellying his way out of ridiculous scrapes.",1235779200,2,4915,4.796930342384888

Bruce plays himself to the hilt with some quirky embellishments that give the movie a nice comedy edge. If you're a fan of Bruce you probably will enjoy it, or if you enjoy comedic horror B movies.

This movie makes fun of those movies and even throws in lots of insider jokes for the fans.  So if you're a Bruce Campbell fan or just enjoy movies that are fun to watch, this one's a no-brainer.

Note: You have to watch all the extras on this disc.  They'll make you appreciate the film much more and want to watch it again and again.",1235088000,,803,4.1558441558441555

Of course any one who knows me or has read any of my reviews knows that I am a huge Bruce Campbell fan, can't help it any thing he is apart of I will buy. So of course I was ready and waiting when this marvelous piece of filmmaking came out [I know I know, I am a fan boy]. Naturally after having a whole weekend of a great Bruce Campbell marathon I was still ready for this movie as was every one around me, of course I now realize that every time a movie comes out or we have some MMA going on I always pay for it. Also every one seems to come to my house and eat up everything; I need to switch this up some time. Any way we all headed back to my house as soon as I purchased this and loaded up with drinks and started the flick, good times.

As I expected this was a really fun film that any and every fan of Bruce would more than enjoy, plenty of inside jokes through out the movie, that marathon right before this helped immensely on that front. The way he mixed his real life with his fictional character was brilliant, even the fake movies in the film he talks about seem like they would great. The story is as follows, are you ready? We open with a couple of teens going to the local cemetery looking to have a good time together, one of these kids happens to be the worlds biggest Bruce fan, I disagree whole heartedly but that is neither here nor there. After being turned down or something like that he wanders off and finds a medallion connected to some door on a tomb, of course he grabs it and rips it off the door. From here our villain Guan-Di emerges and begins to take the kids out one by one, he protects the souls that rest there and also just happens to be the Chinese god of war. Off away in Hollywood we join Bruce on the set of his new film, ""Cave Alien 2"", sounds Bruce fantastic. After leaving the set one day and going to his house Bruce is knocked out and kidnapped and wakes up in a small country town, the town were the demon moves amongst the living. Bruce thinks that this is all set up by his manager so he plays along like nothing is wrong, that is until that he comes face to face with a real demon. From there all bets are off as Bruce must find the real hero in him that he played for so long to beat this thing.

I have to say right now that this is a very funny movie and Bruce is wonderful as a meaner version of him self. As always his comedic timing is second to none as he hits every line perfectly with that wonderful wit and charisma. I love the fact the film while riddled with inside jokes that only fans will get is also a great watch for the average viewer. This film is very funny and you don't have to have seen his other works to appreciate it. Of course for those of us that have seen his previous directorial feature ""Man With The Screaming Brain"" can tell you that this is visually and over all a better movie. Of course that film was made for TV, the Sci-Fi Channel to be exact, this movie did not have to edit its self for made for TV fair. As for the directing Bruce did a great job as the film does not feel like it slows down and the pace keeps to a good speed, taking breaks only when appropriate. Mark Verheiden's script is amazing and was the perfect choice for Bruce's next film, very funny stuff that had a great performer as well. Bruce also served as producer along side Mike Richardson who produced such films as ""AVP, Hellboy 2, and 30 Days of Night"", so this film had a great tam behind it.

Acting wise there are some great performances like Campbell's but others give your typical b level performances, which was great. Bruce of course was great but so was Grace Thorsen as Kelly and Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl [the same from Evil Dead]. Taylor Sharpe as Jeff did a good job as did Ben McCain as the major of the town, as a matter of fact every one played their parts very well, especially the 2 guys who played the gay guys [they were very funny]. Still besides Bruce the show stealer was none other then the great Ted Raimi who played three roles ala Eddie Murphy, all were great as expected. Ted was very believable and funny as Bruce's manager Mills Toddner and was really funny as the sign painter, who was named Ted. Then there was his Chinese character Wing who claimed to be in control of the demon, see how that worked out.

This was a great movie that was very funny especially after watching all of those Bruce related films and TV shows before this one came out. To all Bruce fans you probably already own this but to those who don't you are missing out. And to those who are just casual movie goers this one can also be for you, it is really funny and Bruce provides a funny performance. Also all you movie buffs like myself will love the DVD, it is loaded beyond belief with special features. First off we get a great audio commentary from the man himself Bruce Campbell and producer Mike Richardson as well as a great behind the scenes making of feature. There also a lot of features like ""Bruce on"" my personal favorites ""Kif's Kornor, and awkward moments with Kif"" as well as many others. There are also trailers and gallery's but the best thing is that there are multiple hidden eggs on every screen you can get on, and I mean every screen.

This is a wonderful DVD that all should own and by own I mean buy not burn, and forget rentals, this is a keeper.",1234828800,2,5363,4.161849710982659

He wrote and directed this gem with a style that only he can achieve, with the help from friend Sam Raimi. Bruce makes plenty of jokes about himself and his movies in every way possible. I only hope he continues to write and direct and act in his  films because only Bruce knows Bruce. Other directors and writers of his other films from Alien Apocalypse to Sundown to The man with the screaming brain, don't really get Bruce. I already have watched my copy of this movie twice and enjoyed it more the second time than the first.

****  Out of 5

Release Date- October 31st, 2008

Running Time- 84-Minutes

Rating- R

Screenplay- Mark Verheiden

Director- Bruce Campbell

Starring- Bruce Campbell, Grace Thorsen, Taylor Sharpe, Ben L. McCain with Ellen Sandweiss and Ted Raimi

To your average film fan being a B-movie actor may not sound like a big deal, but what some people fail to realize is that for every Brad Pitt you have a whole slew of B-actors and for every B-actor you have people who never go further than being an extra or simply starring in short films made by friends. And the same goes for writers and directors. Fact is Bruce Campbell has gone further in his career than most people do who get involved in film. But who knew back when the Evil Dead came out that it would make Bruce Campbell a cult Icon. Of all the cult actors or filmmakers none have reached the status of Bruce Campbell; he is by far the definition of cult Icon.

There's a lot of praise among Bruce Campbell fans for My Name Is Bruce and some might wonder is it really that good? The answer is without a doubt yes it really is that good. Sure there are some Bruce Campbell fanboys who will blindly praise anything he does and everyone in film or music or whatever has someone like that who just praises them no matter what. I'm as big of a fan of Bruce Campbell as you'll find, but that doesn't mean I have to like everything he has done; and let's be honest here over the past couple of years his films haven't been as good with the exception of Bubba Ho-Tep, but My Name Is Bruce again shows why Campbell has legion of fans.

The screenplay by Mark Verheiden is excellent; My Name Is Bruce is a B-movie and Verheiden never tries to make it more than that. He knows what kind of movie he's writing and he writes one great screenplay. The movie is always funny in a silly way and that is what this movie is all about. I wasn't sure what to expect from the script, but it was very funny and smart, but always stays true to what it is.

Besides starring and producing, Bruce Campbell also directs and while he's not exactly Sam Raimi, but in his own right Campbell proves to be just as talented behind the camera. The problem these days with cult cinema is filmmakers try too hard. A lot of those who grew up with cult movies of the 70s and 80s are now making their own films and the problem is can you really make a cult movie on purpose? Grindhouse by Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodriguez was excellent, and while they did make a cult flick, but at times that's the problem, but they got it right where most filmmakers failed.

With My Name Is Bruce, Bruce Campbell sets out to make a B-movie and he gets it right 100%. The pacing of the movie is excellent with never once a dull moment. From beginning, middle to end, My Name Is Bruce is always fun and entertaining and never once will you be bored at all. Campbell sets out to make a cult flick and he delivers big time. Again he may not be Sam Raimi, but he clearly knows what he's doing and delivers one of the best cult movies of all time. I have no doubt in my mind My Name Is Bruce will be remembered by fans. The only reason I didn't give this the full 5-stars is the ending was kinda lame, but besides that this movie was amazing.

Bruce Campbell plays an exaggerated version of himself and this is by far his best performance in years! My Name Is Bruce in my opinion is easily in his top 5 performances. Bruce really is an underrated actor and what I love about him is he's not afraid to ham it up and make a fool out of himself on camera and here Bruce was brilliant! Bottom line is this; no actor can deliver a one liner like Bruce can and here he has plenty of them. Actually this may be in his top 3 performances rather than top 5.

Every year actors get snubbed on an Oscar nomination, but my question is what happened to Bruce's nomination? All kidding aside this was a brilliant performance. Bruce made me laugh and cry when he sees the error of his ways. Ok so maybe I didn't cry, but seriously his performance was amazing. Ted Raimi also stars and plays 3 different roles and he was amazing in all 3. I just love seeing Bruce and Ted together again in a movie. These two really work so well together.

My Name Is Bruce is strictly for Bruce Campbell fans I suppose if you don't know who Bruce is you might get some enjoyment, but odds are not much. But if you are a fan of the cult Icon that is Bruce Campbell buy this movie right away!

As for the Blu-ray; while the picture quality is solid at times you can notice the low budget, but I've read some negative reviews on the quality and I don't think it's fair. Granted this may not be the best Blu-ray out on the market, but it's still pretty good. I bought this here on Amazon and at the time it was only $1 more for the Blu-ray so it was more than worth it. The features are solid and are the same as the Blu-ray.",1234569600,7,4911,4.212992545260916
3664488,4,B001KEGR7U,"Just watched it... certainly not a classic film, but a fun watch if you're a big Bruce Campbell fan like me. Lots of inside jokes from his movies and books and some great extras that show everyone really enjoyed making this film. Multiple roles for Ted Raimi is always a plus. The film is a bit slow with limited action, but still fun. Probably hard to recommend to non-Bruce fans, but I doubt they would be buying it anyways.",1234569600,,426,4.405063291139241
3664489,1,B001KEGR7U,"This film was Ed Wood Jr. like but without the charm.  There is obvious compression issues with the video transfer to blu-ray.  The dark and black portion of scenes were very digitized.  I did not enjoy this film at all.  I enjoyed Bruce in Maniac Cop, the Evil Dead films, Adventures of Brisco County Jr., BubaHoTep, because those films had charisma.  This film highly lacks the charisma.  It is an expensive blu-ray and the special features offer nothing but annoying behind the scenes banter and blair witch type docu-shoots.",1234483200,,528,4.876404494382022
3664490,4,B001KEGR7U,"Think of this movie as one in a series.  Go and watch Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness, Bubba Hotep, at least, and THEN watch this move.  If you come into this movie without knowing who Bruce Campbell is then you will definitely be missing out on a lot of wink-wink-nudge-nudge, ""hey, wasn't that the blacksmith from AoD"" type of moments.

Also bear in mind that this is a very ""B"" movie.

But that said, I think this movie captures what it is that makes Bruce Campbell work so well, and why his movies have such a following:  He has captured the essence of Monty Python.  This is a sizable feat which very few actors have ever managed to do.

We all know Monty Python.  We've seen the movies.  We know the lines.  We memorized the songs.  But I think it's easy to overlook how Monty Python became so popular and why those movies were so funny -- it's all in the surprise and the delivery.  To hear the clop clop of an approaching horse and see them come over the hill and it's actually just a guy clacking two coconuts together is funny because it's unexpected.  The argument between the peasants and the King delivered with a straight face is funny.  This is the essence of Monty Python style humor.

And Bruce Campbell has managed to capture that.  It's why (in my opinion) Army of Darkness catapulted him into the spotlight and it's that sort of thing that makes ""My Name is Bruce"" work.

This movie is like a continuation of the Monty Python brand of humor.

That's big.  No, that's huge.  Nobody else is making stuff like this right now.  True, a lot of people won't ""get it"", but that was true of Monty Python as well.  For the people who do ""get it"", this sort of thing is comedy gold.

I do have a hard time pushing it to 5 stars, though, because frankly that's reserved for movies along the lines of Aliens, but make no mistake: if you're a fan of Monty Python then you're probably a fan of Bruce Campbell and you'll be a fan of this movie, too.  Put your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend/husband out of the house and get ready for some old school goodness.",1234483200,2,2058,4.369393139841689
3664511,4,B001KEGR7U,"*** 1/2 to be precise.  ---I don't do plot synopsis, Amazon's handled that one for us all already----

I first heard about this film's production three and half years ago.  I thought it was great idea!  Bruce Campbell playing himself, or at least an over-the-top version of himself, and facing off against a real evil.  It basically plays like The Three Amigos: well known and down and out cult actor gets recruited by fan, who thinks he would actually know about fighting monsters, to fight a monster awakened in said kids town.  It's perfect and fun and goofy little set-up---more so if you love or just like Bruce Campbell.

I love Bruce.  I grew up with his with flicks like the Evil Dead trilogy, Maniac Cop, and the great and sorrowfully cancelled show The Adventures Of Briscoe County Jr.  If you're not a fan of Bruce you will have some trouble settling down into this picture.  I can't lie, this is no crowd pleaser.  This is a fan pleaser, and it may not 100% please them.

The jokes are broad, REALLY BROAD, just one notch below Airplane.  The first hour or so clips along filled with in-jokes and broad humor of the Three Stooges variety, and Bruce's special brand of mugging.  The puns are corny, and the writers and director(Bruce Campbell himself) know they are, and that's why they work.  They're not selling the jokes as legitimate humor, but more as so-corny that it's funny because it's not.  Make sense?

The film has a small budget, but you really can't tell.  How could you?  The whole premise is for the film to look low budget.  The main demon that the town must fight is made-to-look-on-purpose exactly like a guy wearing a monster suit.  The suit is decent, the mask is funny, and apparently makes expressions.  The acting is perfectly over the top for the material.  Even the love interest, who is given the role of straight man, gets some yucks and physical comedy in.  Fan-boys will get joy-joy feelings with cameos from Ellen Sandweis(Evil Dead), Ted Raimi in three roles, and two other back up players from Evil Dead II and Army Of Darkness(won't tell which ones, it's part of the fun when they appear).  Ted Raimi plays an old Chinese man, last living decendent of the Chinese miners, named Wing.  He is an over the top stereotype but the film is so in-offenssive, anyone getting upset by the usual 'W's replacing 'R's in his speech, is far too sensative for life, and seriously needs to get a hobby.  The make-up on this character is very good too.

The problems with this film come from the weak ending, and a villain that isn't well defined or particularly interesting.  The third act goes off into a Looney Tunes tone that the previous material didn't really have.  Which is all fine, but if the villain had more of personality beyond just showing up and lopping off heads and limbs, this could've worked as a give and take kind of thing.  The demon in the picture should've been given more of a voice, more comedy, and more of a hard presence in the film over all.  The only time we get something quirky from the demon***MILD SPOILER*** is when we find out that he is not only the guardian of the dead but the guardian of bean curd(yes, you heard me right).  This is silly, but in context with the rest of the film.  There's a great scene where the villain gets to be kind of goofy---it involves him salvaging thrown containers of bean curd.  The scene reminds me of of that stupid scene in Leprechuan with the shoes.***END OF SPOILERS***  The only other issue I had with the film is the 'why's behind the town hiring Bruce Campbell.  The kid who is a fan is in his teens, and should know the difference between reality and fiction, but still thinks Bruce would know how to fight off the demon.  Okay, maybe he's just the supidest teen alive.  But, what about the rest of the town.  Why would they agree to this?  Why would they want a 'b' movie star to kill their demon?  What other options did they try first?  Maybe I'm nit-picking, but this could've been funny.  We get some fun stuff about how Bruce buys into the premise initially, but not the town's people.  The script just glosses over this plot hole and never looks back.

So if you're already a member of the Bruce cult you'll love seeing him ham-it up and poke fun at his image and career, and play himself as an over-drinking, sex crazy louse.  If not, you're simply going to find this comedy mediocre.  Horror fans will enjoy their icon, and others will wonder why the guy from Burn Notice and Hercules is doing such a corny movie.

I liked it and recommend it to horror historians and Bruce-philes, but modern horror fans be warned, THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM.  Despite some graphic killings, which are quick and mild, and the supernatural theme, there is nothing remotely horror about this film, and the makers never intended there to be.  It's just their muse happened to be a horror icon.

3664515,4,B001KEGR7U,"On the scale of low budget movies that are tongue in cheek this is a good one.  Ok, on the regular scale of movies this would make some movie watchers dismiss this as a low budget horror comedy. I don't think that you have to be a Bruce C fan to enjoy his self parody of a fallen star who is gets some redemption from his disgusting lifestyle.  Bruce has always been able to inject comedy into his movies but this time it's the reason for this movie.  There are some people in the film industry that are as loathsome and self destructive as the character that bruce protrays here.  But's It's not a true picture of the real Bruce C. This character is a total washout as a human being until  he finds redemption
and courage due to bravery of one of the characters fans.
This movie is over the top and everything is played to the comedic except of course for bloody violence that is done by the bean curd protecting monster. And Bruce who has done alot of roles that had no campy element in them does excel in this type of comedic role. So this only shows that the man can excel in either field.  This movie looks excellent on blu ray so this is the superior
version to have.  However if you don't like low budget horror movies

3664516,3,B001KEGR7U,"A B-Movie to its core, this is exactly the movie one would expect it to be. Bruce Campbell, free from any restraints or limitations (other than budget), stuffs this movie with as many one-liners and gags as he can, gives buddy Ted Raimi no less than three roles, and positively revels in the low-budget nature of the production. On the one hand, it works brilliantly - he's an extremely charismatic actor, is genuinely funny, and is even a bit courageous to spoof himself so directly.

On the other hand, it's a bit of a shame that the movie doesn't aim a little higher. Especially given the triumph that was Bubba Ho-Tep and his recent work on Burn Notice, Bruce seems like he'd be in a place that would allow him to reach for more. One of the great things about Campbell's classics is the innovation he and the Raimis brought. The Evil Dead movies in particular were more than just horror/comedies - they were experiments. My Name is Bruce is more of a victory lap by a man who's become a show-business legend (even if he's not exactly a big star).

As a long-time Bruce Campbell fan, I found a lot to enjoy in this movie - his one-liners are the best in the biz, as far as I'm concerned. There's also a ton of special features, as well as a mini-comic-book, which makes for a nice package.

3664517,4,B001KEGR7U,"There is an audio commentary by Bruce Campbell and producer Mike Richardson. Campbell points out that the entire film was shot on his property in Oregon and they built all of the town of Gold Lick from scratch. He points out all of the intentional goofs in the Cavealien 2 film within the film. Campbell also points out all of the people in the film whom he's known or worked with over the years. He talks about his public persona and how it mixes with his actual life in this film on this entertaining track.

""Heart of Dorkness"" is an hour-long making of documentary that starts off riffing on Apocalypse Now. Dark Horse Comics wanted to branch out into independent films and approached Campbell who agreed only if he could direct and star. To cut costs and be more efficient, Campbell hired actors and crew members that he had worked with on other films often going back many years. This is an entertaining and informative look at how this indie film was made.

""Awkward Moments with `Kif'"": features two useless bits of the film's associate producer engaging in pointless banter with another crew member.

""Bruce On..."" sees the actor pontificating about film budgets, talking about the dangerous wildlife near his home, and jokes about DVD extras.

""Cavealien 2 Trailer"" is a pretty funny, intentionally cheesy faux trailer for the movie within the movie.

""Beyond Inside the Cave: The Making of Cavealien 2"" parodies those fluffy making of promotional featurettes that populate most DVDs with the cast and crew talking up a film that is obviously crap.

Kif is back in ""Kif's Korner"" as he talks about the faux DVD and poster art he put together for the film.

Also included are several galleries - poster art (of all the fake films), a gallery for various movie props, and one of movie stills.

""The Hard Truth"" is the E! True Hollywood Story-style profile of Bruce that is shown briefly in the film. This is pretty amusing stuff.

""Love Birds"" documents the ""romance"" between two actors who play rednecks in the film.

I think the guy's funny and witty.

That said, I was REALLY looking forward to, My Name Is Bruce (even paying a few extra bucks to procure an advanced copy of the official DVD release) as it sounded like the perfect vehicle for Bruce to strut his stuff.

The problem being, is that instead of a great parody of Bruce's life (a la, William Shatner's send up in, Galaxy Quest, played to perfection by Tim Allen) we get a very mediocre film, that makes, The Man With The Screaming Brain, play like Shakespeare.

But hey, I guess being one of the few Bruce fans who's not also a, Three Stooges fan, this film might not have been made with anything more than a, ""Stooges"" mentality in mind,  and if so, then perhaps that's why I couldn't get into it.

But that said, I may not be a, ""Stooges"" fan per say, but I can more than appreciate a good bit of goofball antics, but the problem with this film is that, that's about all we get, which become tiresome very fast.

A movie needs a good script to hang the goofball antics off of, but even the script is goofball, ripping off every ""Z"" grade sci-fi/horror clich&eacute; (and not in a good way) that the writer could think of.

I kind of liken this to a bad episode of, Hercules, you know, the ones where they placed Kevin Sorbo and gang in the present (a filler episode). These episodes were made for the fans, to some extent, but had no depth of character, or story, they just kind of rambled on for 45 minutes, then ended.

And that's about what you get here, 90 minutes of self indulgent rambling, with no real substance, and nothing new or cool to add to the, Bruce Campbell mythos.

It's a real shame too, because the idea had so much potential for real comic genius, and a great bit of fun, but what they ended up making was a, ""Seen-it-all-before-and-done-better-in-other-films"" groaner.

But hey, if you're the kind of person who thought that, The Man With The Screaming Brain, and/or, Alien Apocalypse, was this decades, Army Of Darkness, then you'll probably love this movie.

Meanwhile, I'll be watching and waiting for someone to recognize Bruce's potential, and give him another great part, worthy of his comic genius (and this just happens to, ""NOT"" be that film, at least for me, anyway).",1233964800,3,2467,4.519101123595505
3664519,5,B001KEGR7U,"If you are a hard core or even moderate core Bruce Campbell fan then you should not even be reading this review, you should, in fact, be watching this! I tried to step back while viewing this in the perspective of someone who didn't know who ""this bruce guy"" was, or had any experience with his previous films. The fact is that you will not enjoy this movie if you don't like Bruce and his intentional campy-type movies. This movie is B-like by nature and on purpose. If you're only going to take this at face value then seek out Max Payne or whatever new action release is out at the time of viewing this review. Because simply if you're only in it for big booms and A-list stars, you will be unfortunately disappointed.",1233360000,7,721,4.388059701492537
3664520,5,B001KEGR7U,"Entertaining comedy/horror movie. There are many references to Bruce Campbell's past films and there's plenty of Bruce fan memorabilia around.  He even slips in reference to a movie's amazon.com reviews.  Bruce plays a fictionalized (I hope) self-centered version of himself, a B-movie actor, who is drawn into a real horror situation.  Bruce is charmingly offensive and funny while he makes his way among co-workers, fans, and people in town with his usual witty (or wise-cracking) comments throughout the film, and manages to get away with most of it. Ted Raimi can be seen doing a multiple of characters.  This was fun to watch.",1232323200,3,631,5.097087378640777

8314630,3,B001KEGR7U,"This is not one of Mr. Cambell's better movies. He plays a very unlikeable version of himself, and the ghost he's up against is very inconsistent and bizarre in its 'rules' and behavior. As a writer, I say ""if you cannot tell a story that makes basic sense, TELL A DIFFERENT STORY""...except for surreal stories, of course, and even they should have their own weird internal logic, IMO. The stakes aren't very high, the plot makes little sense, some of the scenes are actually gross, the ghost might be a mockery of a real Chinese legend, and at least one character is in yellow-face, which is not even funny enough to excuse the stereotype. On top of that, the whole thing hangs on a teenager deciding that an action movie actor is the best guy to call when there's an ancient Chinese ghost about, which seems rather far-fetched even for a 'wacky' film.

Honestly, when I read that Mr. Cambell would be playing himself and get caught up in an adventure, this is not what I pictured, particularly as I recall the description claiming (falsely) that he kept trying to tell people he was not an action hero, just a guy. To me, Bruce  Cambell playing a close-to-real-life Bruce Cambell, roped into an adventure by a bunch of fans, and...maybe finding the hero inside himself and saving the day? sounds like a much better movie to me. I wish that movie existed instead of this one :'(",1520035200,,1379,4.578947368421052
