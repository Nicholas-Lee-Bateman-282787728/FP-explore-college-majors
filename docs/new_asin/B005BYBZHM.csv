4649404,1,B005BYBZHM,"This remake offers a few good, atmospheric sets that are apparently meant to be some kind of Nantucket-New Bedford mashup (don't ask). There are also a few interesting costumes, mixed in with a larger number which are questionable. Other than that, let me say this: several reviewers have tried to warn you how little respect this piece of trash has for Melville's plot or philosophy, but no one has been able to do justice to just how tedious the whole exercise is. Between being monotonous, illogical, digressive, long-winded, poorly written, and poorly edited, you are about to spend what feels like a week in front of the screen wondering how William Hurt can shout line after line in the same impotent rasp for so many hours without growing a nodule on his larynx. You could *almost* save this movie by cutting it down to less than a quarter of its running time. In fact, the more of it you cut, the more the movie could be saved. The perfect edition of this remake would probably run 1 minute 30 seconds.",1322092800,5,1010,4.616666666666666
4649405,1,B005BYBZHM,I watched this movie to see how far they can actually go to totally destroy a legend and I didn't have to wait long. They took so many liberties with this movie that Melville wouldn't have recognized it. Don't waste your time watching this piece of trash. The only movie that seems to follow pretty well is the 1957 version with Gregory Peck. I guess the main problem is that they have used so many modern words and values that somewhere the middle part of the 19th century slipped into oblivion.,1319068800,4,496,4.461538461538462
4649406,4,B005BYBZHM,"This two-part original German produced miniseries is more a psychological thriller about how one man's deadly obsession triggers his decent into madness.

Previously, director John Huston working from a Ray Bradbury script and starring an under-appreciated Gregory Peck as the demented, megalomaniacal Captain Ahab has done justice to Herman Melville's masterpiece.

But here we have a slightly different ambiance and look, but none-the-less a surprisingly adept production that puts us on the Pequod to face god, madness, nature and that mighty white whale Moby Dick.  The New York Times calls this German production ""an ambitious, beautifully made adventure tale that seeks to be respectful of the book while still making the characters and story accessible to modern viewers,"" and the Wall Street Journal adds, ""there is much to marvel at in this production.""  Ethan Hawke, John Hurt, Donald Sutherland and Gillian Anderson star.

I liked this a lot more than I expected.  All the open sea action looks great on the BD, widescreen transfer.  And the great white whale is a frightening and sympathetic monster that looks just fine in its digital iteration.",1319068800,6,1158,5.295081967213115

4649409,5,B005BYBZHM,"While the movie is not 100% faithful to Melville's classic, it does take artistic license in all the right places, adding a couple new elements and characters here or there.

4649410,1,B005BYBZHM,"Moby Dick is the name of this movie. That's how bad this movie is. They didn't even get the title of the book right. It's not ""Moby Dick"" but ""Moby-Dick."" A quibble, you say? Granted. So let's turn flukes and move on to everything else the movie gets wrong.

1. People in 1850s using modern language and expressions. That's lazy writing and even lazier research. I don't even.

2. A sperm whale (Moby-Dick) that looks nothing like a sperm whale but has facial features similar to Jason Voorhees from the Friday 13th films. I kid you not. Wrong head size, wrong proportions overall, wrong side flippers, the eyes are the size of huge dinner plates (did these mongrels who made this film even bother to look at ONE picture of a sperm whale?)and wrong physics of moving through the water. Then again what do you expect from CGI monkeys are are more in love with the computer technology than reality? It's white, ain't it and it's got a big whoppin' flipper at the end? Move on, technicians!

3. An Ahab that laughs and capers and smiles and jokes and gibbers with hilarity. Oh. You were expecting a grim, cold man wrapped in dark obsession...you know, like the book is supposed to be about? Sorry. This Ahab is a clown by nature. He laughs! He capers! He laughs some more! Deal with it.

4. A Stubbs who is grim and cold and wrapped in dark obsession instead of being the jovial character he was supposed to be. So. Yeah. The ignorant ungulates who made this film switched the emotions of Stubbs and Ahab from the book. I was vaguely surprised they didn't work in a car chase and a couple of Vampire Hookers from Outer Space, because, you know, I guess they wanted to try and make the film relevant. Or something.

Look. I could go on listing howler after howler. I don't mind remakes. I do mind remakes that have no love or appreciation for the source material, however. And this film falls in that category. Okay. What did they get right?  Well...there was a ship names Peaquod that went a'whalin' one day. Other than that....

Seriously. Don't waste your time with this monstrosity. It's typical Hollywood mongrelization of a beloved classic. Trust me on this one, you'd be better off watching a bowl of goldfish. That would have more in line with the original novel than this knuckle-dragging and ill-advised remake.

And, yes, I'm being kind in my review of this film. I didn't even mention the tender home scenes of a misty-eyed Ahab with his wife beside a cracking fire. Oops.",1313884800,26,2480,4.582392776523702
4649411,1,B005BYBZHM,"To say that this reader found no joy in this rendering of the classic tale is to to state the obvious: there is little joy in this cautionary tale of obsession and revenge. But my problem here goes way beyond the somber mood that Melville creates for us and that is literally recreated (along with the wonderful narration) in the 1956 origional film. Here we have a grinning Ahab courtesy of William Hurt. You will find no mention of a grinning countenance in the book. Likewise the liberties taken with the plot are to me as unforgiven as is our great whale to the captain. NB Spoiler Alert, To wit: The scene in which Ahab stands upon the mighty back of the creature with his bloody lance and utters "".....Thus I stabbeth ye oh dammed whale....."" is gone. Gone! The hair raising scene in which Ahab arises like Christ to beckon his crew to their death (as prophesized by Ejijah) is gone! Here we have Starbuck returning to the Pequod to keep Pip company rather than going to a watery grave in the wake of Moby Dick. And as if to add insult to injury Ishmael ducks under the water and holds his breath to watch a very poor rendering of Moby Dick swim past as if they are in a Hollywood swimming pool. Dear friends it is a total loss. But that is not the worst of it. The core, the very raison d'etre of Melvilles work has been discarded perhaps because it was not understood. Listen here: go 98 minutes into the origional and listen to Gregory Peck give the grand soliloquy which defines this epic and gives it it's life. He recites Melvilles prose verbatim. It begins ""Is Ahab Ahab..."" and ends with ""where do murders go man..."" What follows is a discourse on the nature of the universe and life itself. It is the conflict between free will and determinism. ""If the sun cannot rise in the sky without God's will how can I Ahab raise this arm?"" Free will vs Determinism. Ahab feels he must complete his tragic voyage even as he sees it unfold before him because he is preordained to do so by a higher authority. Do we plot our own course through life or are we just characters in a great play authored by the gods? This is the core of Melville's opus. The great philosophical conundrum to be debated in our classrooms and perhaps in our hearts and our souls. It is gone from this empty rewrite. Gone! How sad for us. Watch the origional movie and listen to Gregory Peck recite Melville as he would recite Shakespeare. It deserves to be heard as it was written. Or better yet, read the book.",1313280000,18,2491,4.393939393939394
4649412,4,B005BYBZHM,"'Call me Ishmael' are the first words of the sole survivor of a lost whaling ship as he relates the tale of his captain's self-destructive obsession to hunt the white whale, Moby Dick.  They are words that have become often quoted by many authors and poets and for any number of reasons, yet they open the mysteries and beauties of one of the greatest American novels every written.  There have been many cinematic productions of MOBY DICK, Herman Melville's 1851 supreme novel - 1956 with Gregory Peck as Ahab and 1998 with Patrick Stewart in the Ahab role -  and each has its strong and weak points.  There are many detractors of this current version who rightfully state that too few of Ahab's great speeches and lines have been omitted and that this version is too influenced by contemporary reasoning.  But the tale is  a great one and the splendid extended reveries and 'speeches' of Captain Ahab rest beautifully on the written page, a factor that allows mulling over the words and the meaning and the drama that may just fall a bit heavy when incorporated into a screenplay.  Better the flavor of the story be conveyed by what cinema allows - imagery - that books can't mimic.  This current version does just that - it finds the core of the obsession of a man driven by a struggle with his past, with nature,  and with the personal vendetta against the great white whale, Moby Dick, who claimed Ahab's leg in the past.  Nigel Williams is responsible for the screenplay, Mike Barker directs.

Ishmael (Charlie Cox) sees his dream of a whaling voyage come true when he and his Hapoonist friend Queequeeg (Raoul Trujillo) join the crew of the Pequod, a sailing vessel leaving port in Nantucket. What Ishmael and the mates don't initially appreciate is that the Pequod's monomaniacal Captain Ahab (William Hurt) is taking them all on a mad and personal mission to slay the great whale Moby Dick, an obsession that will open their eyes to the wonder and spectacle of man, of beast, and the inescapable nature of both. The flavor of the crew is well captured by a solid cast, including Ethan Hawke as a rather weak Starbuck, Eddie Marsan as Stubb, Billy Boyd as Elijah, Billy Merasty as Tashtego, Onyekachi Ejim as Dagoo, Matthew as Flask, James Gilbert as Steelkit, Gary Levert as Perth, and Daniyah Ysrayl as the cabin boy Pip.  The special effects offer vivid and credible underwater activity of Moby Dick and the clashes with nature both within the crew and on the ocean are very well represented.  The final underwater scene with Ahab strapped dead to the still alive and swimming Moby Dick is unforgettably realistic and a fine balance with the ever-innocent Ishmael grasping the empty coffin as the sole survivor of the voyage.

William Hurt gives us a different Ahab in Nigel Williams' script adaptation - less mad but more obsessed, less cruel and more vulnerable than we are used to seeing - but he is strong and takes us with him as he meets his end in his struggle with Nature.  It is a moving adventure and despite the omissions that seem to bother most viewers, the movie does cast a spell over the entire 3 hours.  Grady Harp, August 11",1312329600,17,3153,4.664259927797834

4649429,2,B005BYBZHM,"This could have been a classic with the cast on hand, but falls way short due to the writers, producers and directors  lack of interest in creating a realistic fact based story. How can you have a crew of whalers sailing out of Nantucket on a ship that wasn't designed and built for the intended purpose, whaling. No the ship is not a whaler! From there the story dives further into the depths of monotony with a crew and officers locked in a struggle of infighting that would have never have happened or been stood for by the Captain of a sailing vessel that was to be at sea for 2 to 3 years.

4649478,5,B005BYBZHM,"Moby Dick is a great movie because of Captain Ahabs character and his language. First, there is Ahabs character. His obsession with spilling Moby Dicks black blood carries the movie. Its not just the whales black blood that Ahab is focused on, however. Its also the whales cursed whiteness. Ahab likens whiteness to death and evil, and he believes that the universe has appointed him as killer of the white whale. Neither storms nor any concern for the lives of his crew will stop him from his pursuit of the devil that took his leg years ago and left him to walk on a wooden stump. He wants revengesweet revenge--and nobody on board has the will to change his course. A few try, but it doesn't go well for them. The other reason why Moby Dick is a classic movie is the language.  Much like Melvilles novel, the language is great because it is colorful. It is full of imagery and symbolism, oaths and prophecy. Ahabs colorful language is delivered with passion and fatalism, and the crew falls under the spell with his words. When he yells A dead whale or a stove boat, lads, the crew cheers, caught up his madness. Ahabs obsessive lines are delivered with the thunder of madman. This is an epic story of the human heart and the sea. Its well worth signing on for the journey. --Roger Weston, author of Fatal Return",1430524800,,1315,4.525210084033613
4649479,1,B005BYBZHM,"My review is more about the format ""Widescreen"" DVD, that was sold by: Magic SuperCenter! and fulfilled by Amazon (I think that's how it works). I've seen this movie in widescreen before & really loved the panoramic widescreen ocean scenes... that was my reason for buying it... but that's not what I received!  The so called ""Widescreen"" version I received says on the back of the dvd box ""Widescreen Version Presented To Preserve The Aspect Ratio Of It's Original Television Exhibition. Enhanced For Widescreen TVs.""  Well, that must mean that they've zoomed it in at least twice to fit my widescreen HD TV, because half the movie is cut off & the tops of their heads!  You basically get to see the guys faces so zoomed in when their in the row boats, that you hardly see the ocean!  So if you're planning on purchasing this in widescreen (the only way it should be watched)make sure you get a REAL widescreen version. This company ""Magic SuperCenter"" listed this as widescreen dvd format, condition: New-Brand New in Factory sealed package.  I will make sure I don't buy from this company again, for I won't really know if I'm getting a true widescreen format!  As for this version of Moby Dick, it's not the classic with Gregory Peck, but it's fun (if you can handle long movies) and for me, the ocean scenes are what made this worth watching.  The movie I would rate 3 to 3.5 stars.",1428624000,4,1387,4.6138211382113825

4649483,2,B005BYBZHM,"I have given this movie a two star rating.  The 1956 Peck movie, despite his awkward portrayal of Ahab, is far better, tighter in story line and more consistent with Melville's classic. The acting in this newer version is consistently sub-par and it is difficult to have any compassion for any of the characters.  The movie is way to long, containing almost as many boring segments as Melville's classic, if you have read the book, you know what I mean, despite its other significant virtues including great major plot, character development and documentation of whaling life.  This newer  movie contains a number of sub plots, characters, and relationships which have no connection with the original Melville plots, apparently included to extend the pictures length.  One positive aspect of this version is the whale imaging, an improvement over the 1956 production, yet the use of the whale character within the story line is far less dramatic than in the earlier movie.  Also the rendition of the Pequod was very authentic, as was that of early Nantucket.  I read Moby Dick, or at least most of it, about once a decade and look at the 1956 movie about once a year,  I have no plans to watch this current version again.  Even for a Moby Dick lover, this movie does not justify either the purchase or the viewing time.",1424476800,5,1319,4.775330396475771
4649484,4,B005BYBZHM,"This is a great movie; it is a little difficult to sit through in one viewing. I give four stars because there are elements throughout that could have been approached in a way to make it more relevant to relate to a modern audience. In comparison for example ""old English bible"" to ""modern English bible"", they are both great; but the modern English bible is going to be easier to relate to. It is a daunting task to say the least to try to capture a work such as ""Moby Dick"" in a relatively short movie. It took Hollywood three, three hour movies to depict the Hobbit.

I pretty much agree with all of the negative reviewers here who gave it 1 star. It completely misses the point of the book, ruins Melville's prose, and introduces a kinder-gentler Ahab invented out of whole cloth. It also has Ishmael become a stooge and suck-up for the captain. This is all gratuitous and embarrassing to anyone who has read the book.

4649501,3,B005BYBZHM,"No, not this Moby D version!
To me 'Gregory Peck's' version was #1; every aspect , Incredible. Seems truest to Melville's book too. The Peck version was directed by John Huston, written by Ray Bradbury and envisioned with all the elements of whale hunting in the early 1800's; it's incredibly vivid, powerful and complex beyond words. Except, maybe Masterpiece. Of course no surprise with the talents involved.

(Orson Wells was to be Ahab; here he's cast as a spell-binding pulpit pounder preaching to those whose lives are hard,
precarious and harsh. One of a great cast, BaseHart and Leo Glenn also reflect that age and its sensibilities.

(I read MOBY DICK an eon ago; based on dimming memories I suggest every reader read it. Masterpiece.) Melvilles books are sold used, often 'like new' in Amazon MarketPlace. Too-good-to-be- true prices will surprise you. Look for books with seven of
HM's best stories compiled; they offer a few bucks per title.) :

For this 1956 rendition, here're subjective notes;

I saw the Peck version on laser; softer, far less sharp than today's digital purity. There's a phrase creatives use:  ""charming artlessness"". The film seemed like we are there. The scruffy crew real, angry ocean scary, the White Whale awesome. So I
of course prefer it to today's slickness.

This 'John Hurt' version in this maybe last version is oaky-good, but feels only like fishing
today. Complete with contemporary sound, music and ultra-sharp cinematography effects.

Hurt's rendition of Ahab grates on me - Hurt, always good, but scripted words and actions don't jive with my reading of Moby D.
His Ahab giggles and laughs and sings and seems not at all like a compulsive crazy whaler captain. And he's entirely too into the sub-teen cabin boy. And there's a melodramatic flavor to all scenes and the plot, abridged from Melville's pages seems somehow con temporized. And he smiles and mugs while his eyes sparkle. A confused, confusing Ahab.

The same's true with Hawke's 1st Mate. Too much the devout hawk, he's both too strong and too weak by turns.
While throughout the crew sings hauling line nearly like a broadway chorus. They seemed pretty-well cleaned up, too.",1393113600,6,2186,4.986263736263736

4649505,1,B005BYBZHM,"Festooned with ridiculous dialogue and absolutely ham-fisted acting,this painful rendition of MOBY DICK should have never seen the light of day. William Hurt, as Ahab, gives one of the worst and most misguided performances I've seen in years. On top of all this, the Pequod is a schooner in this film, not a square-rigged whaling ship. For those of you who don't know why this is so absurd, I'll tell you. Firstly, a schooner is not built heavily enough to withstand the rigors of a two to three-year whaling journey, and that's how long most of those trips lasted. Go to Mystic Seaport in CT and check-out a schooner. Then compare it to the whaling ship Charles W. Morgan. You'll see what I mean. Secondly, she's too small to carry enough men to properly man the whale boats. Most importantly, she would not be able to carry enough barrels of whale oil to make the journey profitable. If you study the history of whaling you will find that schooners were NEVER used to hunt whales. So the film fails before it even starts. Buy the 1956 version with Gregory Peck instead of this travesty. You won't be sorry.",1387411200,6,1108,4.601010101010101

4649507,2,B005BYBZHM,"This film belongs to the upside-down world. Captain Ahab is the first major character to be presented and made into a cosy aging married man with with a nice big mansion and some little whim of going for a strange wale he cannot forget, who once was mean to him. He resembles an old bank clerk rather than a sailor - he is even dressed like an old Polish Jew and with a typical 'fiddler on the roof hat' and displayes the conspicuously melancholic world view of of an ageing member of this noble 'chosen race' - the motive of this violation of Mellville's original plot would be turning his invincible white wale to a ghost of antisemitism, and to begin the film with what seems most important - the melancholic loveable Jew. There is nothing semtimental about the real captain Ahab, he is wearing a tall cylinder and does not befriend anybody of his crew like another grandpa - and his fate is convincing - not faked like in this deplorable 'greatest ever' drama. Its script even fails to account for the sudden emergence of 'Rakel', the ship that in the final scene saved Melville's sole survivor and vitness 'Ismael' to tell the whole story: The agenda of this film is all too clear for anybody kowledgeable - one star only for unbearable destruction of original plot - another added for beautiful sea imagery.",1386115200,8,1313,4.591489361702128

The special effects done on the whale ""Moby Dick"" are so real.  I also purchased this DVD along with Neverland (2011) the TV Mini-Series.

4649539,1,B005BYBZHM,"First off, it took three viewings of about an hour each to watch this steaming heap, each viewing seemed an eternity. It appears the ""director"", Matt Barker (I'd never heard of him either)used the time honored ""Chinese fire-drill"" method of direction with his woefully mis-cast crew of the PEQUOD, especially William Hurt as ""Ahab"" and Ethan Hawke as ""Starbuck"". Ahab seems more like a high school football coach than an omnipotent and monomaniacal captain of a whaler. He just wants to be LOVED by his crew, he calls them aft for regular pep rallies; PEQUOD, PEQUOD SIS BOOM BAH! Starbuck is just so much scenery for William Hurt to chew and believe me, he chews puh-lenty. The 40 or so minutes of tedious and hertofore non-existent back story of Mister Captain and Mrs. Ahab and their adorable youngster, only fleetingly mentioned in the book, is a time of great navel cogitation and looking outside wondering where those geraniums came from all of a sudden.

Have you ever heard a sperm whale growl, bellow and/or roar? You will here! And what a whale: clearly the CGI artists designed Moby-Dick based on a bad second-hand description given by a blotto ""Pinocchio"". Moby-Dick's model looks like nothing quite so much as a bleached ""Monstro"",I actually laughed out loud as the white whale rolled his massive expanse of blubber to display the beckoning dead Ahab at the end, Moby-Dick's makers missed the mark as much as writer Nigel Williams (I've also never heard of him either)missed the point. He had enough of the details going so one doesn't think he hasn't read the book but as for the rest of it he makes one really wonder. What presumption to think he could take this magnificent epic, this MAGNUM OPUS of Herman Melville, this GREATEST novel in the English language and IMPROVE upon it? I could go on but my doctor warned me about my blood pressure. In closing, all I have to say is see this movie and you too will be saying ""There she Blows!""",1342396800,11,1954,4.713450292397661

My wife really enjoyed the realism of the ship, rigging etc.  This to me was just a very good movie with some substance provided by the interesting charectors.",1336521600,,689,4.456
4649542,4,B005BYBZHM,"I think we can probably agree that undertaking a modern film version of a beloved classic is virtual cinematic suicide. I applaud all cast, crew, and writers on this project for taking a chance on presenting a different aspect of the classic book.

It would be impossible to render Moby Dick on the screen without allowing for vast artistic liberties. NONE of the former film versions have done complete justice to the book because the book is, in large parts, unfilmable. All former versions have their merits, as does this one. But I take exception to the idea that it is ""trash"" simply because some reviewers revile its lack of ""authenticity.""

There are many really nice ideas played out in this film that the book never brings to light. For me, I find this sort of thing interesting, not threatening and repulsive as other reviewers do. As mentioned, the first half hour gives us a chance to meet Ahab at home with wife and son. This is because the crux of this film version is to demonstrate Ahab's journey from light into darkness and madness. In order to accomplish this, the screenwriter wanted to demonstrate the captain's humanity more deeply. In other film versions (as well as the novel itself), the captain does not appear until well into the sea voyage. What works well for a reader, privy to Ishmael's thoughts and concerns, does little for a cinematic viewer. I think it was an interesting and wise choice to allow us to better know our hero.

I don't think anyone can complain with the casting. The casting director ought to be paid handsomely for assembling this much wonderful talent. After a series of stern, forbidding Ahabs, William Hurt brings the most complicated and layered Ahab yet to film. Ethan Hawk does an excellent job as Starbuck, and Eddie Marsan (who is so great in everything he does), is a perfect Stubb. In the part of Ahab's wife, Gillian Anderson does a great job. A special mention goes to Raoul Trujillo in the crucial role of Queequeg, who was simply wonderful (as he was in Apocalypto).

The other thing that this film version does that many other film versions don't achieve is in establishing the crucial element of Moby Dick's strength, speed, and mystery. Seeing its destructive power, we truly feel, along with the crew, the danger and terror of the mission they are on.

I withhold a star simply in that the script does not hold together quite as well as I would hope to see. The dramatic arc of the film is simply not as strong as it could have been. But in all, it is well worth seeing and has some wonderful scenes.",1336176000,5,2569,4.637362637362638
4649543,5,B005BYBZHM,"No, no, no.  Calm down.  I know what you're about to say.  Just hear me out.

For the movie-maker, Moby-Dick is, like any other brick-sized tome, very problematic. There is just too much stuff, and unless one has the luxury of filming a five-hour movie and releasing it in installments (see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows), material has to be cut, and the story amended accordingly so it will make sense with the cuts. This sort of boiling-down is fine for relatively simple books (such as, again, Harry Potter), but not with the likes of Moby-Dick. Not only is there a lot of stuff, but almost all of it is important! This is where the other movies fail. They try to be too literal and everything just ends up getting swamped by spectacle.

Consider the first three. The first, with John Barrymore (1930), misses the point with such a breathtaking completeness that it is only worth mentioning because it exists. The second, with Gregory Peck (1956), is ambitious, and does a few things well, but Ray Bradbury's lackluster screenplay, and his strained relationship to the director, bulldoze any chance of overall success. The third, with Patrick Stewart (1998), is a bizarre, half-assed, condescending, wishy-washy mess which isn't just a little boring.

So what did they do here? How did they juggle all the stuff in Moby-Dick?  Simple.  They didn't.

Instead, they stuck to the barest bones of the story, only those things absolutely essential--Elijah, the encounter with the Rachel, Ahab's first speech to the crew, and so on--and threw out everything else to focus on the characters. By doing this, Melville's fundamental themes, the very reasons Moby-Dick is as compelling as it is in the first place, are thrown into relief. Ahab becomes Jonah. The whale himself becomes the unattainable goal, the inability to escape fate. The questions of friendship, loyalty, equality among men, hubris, prophesy, the existance of God: it's all there.

One might be a little jarred, at first, when the movie begins and then almost immediately diverges, and drastically, at that, from Melville, but all one needs is to wait a few minutes to see William Hurt as Ahab to be hooked. He is excellent, charismatic, haunting, and blows Gregory Peck's frustratingly one-dimensional Ahab clear out of the water (hint: Peck himself wasn't satisfied with the movie). The acting is good in general, but William Hurt takes over the camera. This Moby-Dick is worth watching if only to see him as Ahab.

My overall impression: Impressive, sweeping, riveting, epic, and in all other ways superb.  A few small pacing problems bog things down a bit after the halfway point, but they're manageable.  My one regret is that the final showdown with the whale wasn't as colossal as it is in the book: Ahab grappling with his lower jaw, for instance.  It would also be nice if there were a proper title sequence, but that's just an annoying trend in movies in general.

Otherwise, beautiful.  If nothing, check it out just to see William Hurt and the gorgeous camerawork.",1327104000,72,3046,4.919921875
4649544,2,B005BYBZHM,"Huge fan of Moby Dick, although unlike most fans, I think, I am happy to see somebody butcher that book so it can be seen on the screen.  You'd have to!  Faithful literalism would be snoresville.

And this movie can boast some (mostly) impressive shots of the CGI whale.  Certainly the best to be seen on screen since that hideous rubber inflatable that Gregory Peck contended with.

The beef I had with this one was how they treated the Ahab character.  I'm skeptical William Hurt had many ideas for the role, and his performance is so gaseous that you don't actually believe they're on a ship for a minute.

The real problem, though, was the script:  just a couple minutes into the movie we're getting an intimate scene with Ahab's wife and family, replete with close-ups!  This was an unfortunate decision, I think.  Much of the power of a mythic Ahab derives from his remoteness, and to shove him into the viewer's face, to so humanize him early in the movie, help to throw a wet blanket on the cosmic struggle that is supposed to conclude the film.  Melville didn't means for a mere mortal to grapple with the whale.  That is part of the reason Ahab remains hidden until a good third of the book has elapsed:  he is a hero, he contends with Gods, he must be larger than life.

So big mistake in the way the script treated Ahab.",1326153600,18,1332,4.450413223140496
