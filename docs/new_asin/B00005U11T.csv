However, that's not even enough members to form a team yet Ryo and her friends still have a long road ahead.  And to make matters worse the roadblocks being throw up by the league officials are keeping the teams dreams in a glass cage.  They'll have to find a woman brave enough to step in front of and catch Ryo's ""volcanic heat"" as well as three more girls.  A mysterious girl hides in the shadows, friend or foe?  A ditsy aspiring model makes an appearance but doesn't seem to have the skill to make the make the cut.  They still don't have a clean up batter either.  And if that wasn't enough, Ryo's rival comes forward with a challenge that could bury the team forever!",1256342400,,800,4.438356164383562
8119865,5,B00005U11T,"The first episode of this awesome show continues right where the first disc left off. We get to see the addition of a catcher to the team (a big, heavy girl who's as shy as a deer and as strong as an Ox). And then...Oh man!

The rest of the episodes through the end of the disc cover the REAL story of the show, the rivalry between Ryo and Izumi. Already, in the second disc we have a SHOWNDOWN. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Izumi is one of the most complex characters in all of anime. The first few times I saw these episodes I really couldn't quite figure out why exactl Izumi doing what she is doing. She hates Ryo for many reasons. She hates Ryo because she is stealing the guy she loves. She hates Ryo because she thinks she's below her, and yet Ryo keeps showing her up. But most of all (and I DO mean most of all), she hates Ryo because she loves her mother more than anything and doesn't feel like her mother loves her back.

When Izumi first found out about her mother's decision to start a baseball team she was puzzled, then annoyed, then furious. She was a star tennis player and everyone admired her, but her mother just ignored her. Why? And when she saw the way her mother paid so much interest to helping Ryo, it only made her more furious. The final nail in the coffin though, was when Izumi found a locket around her mother's neck of a man who not her father (enough to drive her near insane because if her mother loved someone more than her father, how COULD she love Izumi her daughter). When she found out that the man was Ryo's father... it wasn't pretty.

Once she found out, Izumi became determined to drive Ryo out of HER school and HER life. A face-off was inevitable, and of course it involves baseball. The coach suggests that if Izumi gets struck out by Ryo she will have to join the baseball team (which DESPERATELY needs a power-hitter), and Izumi's condition is that if she gets a hit in three pitches the baseball team will disband and the players will leave the school. Wow.

What follows is some very high drama as Ryo and Izumi push themselves past their limits to ensure their victory. Ryo manges to become even faster than before, and Izumi literally pushes herself until her hands are bleeding and her wrists are breaking. When the battle between the two actually started I was on the edge of my seat, and the conclusion was both unexpected and powerful.

The ending of the disc really shows just how good this show is. The melodrama is so heavy that a poor casting or performance could have ruined it. Instead the excellent voice-acting makes it some of the finest performances and story-telling in anime history. Izumi's ultimate decision at the end of the disc shows that not only is she a person driven to accomplish what she feels she must, she also is a person with extreme loyalty, pride, and honor, who cannot bear unfairness and more than she can bear weakness.

With the ending of this phase of the story, the dramatic prelude concludes, and we are set up for the rest of the story. The actual baseball games are to come, and the development of the rest of the characters provides some wonderful entertainment. Don't think that the drama is over though. Far from it. If you've watched the show thus far you definitely should stay tuned for the third disc. Who knew baseball could be so exciting?",1115424000,,3349,4.435772357723577
8119866,5,B00005U11T,"!!^_^!! I absolutely loved this! Princess Nine is an incredibly wunnerful series to boot, and this disc just keeps you on the edge of your seat~!!!
I won't try to spoil it, but my heart went out to Keiko and Izumi... *sniffcrysob*
Somehow the dub script is a bit more forward than the original Japanese one. (As in Keiko's first question in the interview...*cackle*) But it's super effective!! I love the voice actors. ^^ Kudos to everyone who was associated with the series!",1025481600,,475,4.734939759036145
8119867,5,B00005U11T,"I've been into Anime for some time now, with ones like Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Bubblegum Crisis 2040, Nadesico and others but this series just keeps me coming back. I've Watched both DVD's more than any others i own and instead of telling you what they are about, cos it's kinda hard to when it seems to be all about baseball but really has so much more to it. It could really fall under several catagories. I'm really just eager for disc 3, i've never grown impatient with an anime release, but i have been checking back for a pre-order for the 3rd Installment for over a month now. I really couldn't emphasize my affection for this DVD enough, it's just my style and sumthing about Hilary Haag, who just outta nowhere became my favorite English voice actor. If you haven't yet checked out this series, give it a serious look. It may not be your typical anime filled with Violence, Nudity or anything like those giant mech ones, but just Unique in its own right. Even though i liked the first dvd just a little bit more and it had 5 episodes instead of 4 like this one, i still had to give this dvd 5 stars but if i could i'd give it a 6 or 7 and the first dvd an 8 or 9. If you don't like this anime, well i guess we'd have to be complete opposites from eachother in every respect. Well i think i've babbled more than enough so i think i'll pop Princess nine in for another spin ^_^",1015113600,2,1382,4.1992481203007515
