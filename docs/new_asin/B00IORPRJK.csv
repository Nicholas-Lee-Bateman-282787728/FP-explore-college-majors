6284442,1,B00IORPRJK,One of those movies where they have to throw soft porn in for bad acting/storyline. Don't waste your time or money.,1414108800,,115,4.523809523809524
6284443,3,B00IORPRJK,"Metaphysical horror is tricky, but can be fun (if not well done) popular examples like 12 Monkeys, Into the Mouth of Madness or the lesser known but excellent Triangle prove that out. However, it's tough to keep overlapping story and time lines from tripping over each other and snarling the whole thing, to do so requires iron control. Mine Games seems a decent idea, but it lacking in that control and so, largely becomes a semi-suspenseful exercise in abstraction. The cast is game and with a little better writing and a little more directorial it may have been a much better film. Watch it, but keep expectations appropriately low.",1413763200,,635,4.834862385321101
6284444,1,B00IORPRJK,Pretty dumb,1412380800,,11,5.0
6284445,1,B00IORPRJK,The plot was pretty evident; no surprises. I found myself doing other things with this playing in the background. Did not keep me engaged.,1412121600,,138,4.791666666666667
6284446,3,B00IORPRJK,"If you've seen the movie ""Coherence,"" then you've seen Mine Games.

Both stories involve lights in the sky (or the lack of lights) and characters suddenly not being who or what they seem. They both are a bit trippy and the characters and their relationships begin to unravel under the stress.

The problem for Mine Games is that Coherence executed this spinning-Groundhog-gone-evil night much better. Mine Games lack the depth of characters that Coherence has and, consequently, the tension that exists external to the harrowing night.

Plus it saddles itself with needless characters that don't further the plot (i.e a medium who is pretty and ""powerful"" but utterly useless to the characters or to the movie).

To say much more is to be unfair to both stories. The beauty of this game is how it unfolds, and if you're going to watch the movie, you shouldn't know the ending in advance.

Mine Games isn't a bad movie. It just suffers in comparison to a better one; one that played mind games much better.",1412035200,,1005,4.786127167630058
6284447,2,B00IORPRJK,"It could have been so much better.
The acting wasn't horrible. But it wasn't great either. Mine Games falls short of any kind of path to an end conclusion. It is so choppy that even an end to this boat ride of a movie will leave you hating yourself for purchasing it, many days after. Yea sure it has some B movie suspense as well as some jumpy moments, but what it makes up for in acting it lacks in pretty much every other rule there is to making a horror film. I would say, See it if you must. But you really wouldn't be missing much. Skip it.",1411948800,,546,4.018348623853211
6284448,4,B00IORPRJK,Very good and clever thriller / horror! Great special features too.,1410134400,,67,5.181818181818182
6284449,2,B00IORPRJK,"Idiotic, I saw this on a preview where it was called, ""THE EVIL WITHIN"".  Just another video fake flick.  Avoid the fake ""good"" reviews.",1410048000,,136,4.625
6284450,3,B00IORPRJK,"Young adults, cabin in the woods, no cell phone reception, disabled vehicle, drugs, and headline about a missing girl....spin the spinner and we get vampires? zombies? slasher? Big Foot? ghosts? nope. What we get is an abandoned mine plus an old ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Now don't get me wrong, I love cabin in the woods tales. I also love the twist of the old Zone episode, because I get to yell ""First!"" when I figure out the twist before anyone else knows there is a twist. I don't want to say which episode, or compare it to other films as that would spoil it for the teen-twenty something target audience who should enjoy this film more than myself. But as far as a horror film goes, I was mostly bored with the been-there, done-that clever plot which didn't add much in ways of dialog, characters, or eye candy.

Works as a rental.

6284451,2,B00IORPRJK,I watched for Julianna Guill and My friend Lindsey Lamb who did great...just a mediocre script.,1423353600,,95,5.0
6284452,1,B00IORPRJK,"clever idea, horrible title, piss poor execution. an absolute disaster",1419552000,,70,6.1
6284453,1,B00IORPRJK,"Interesting idea, but everything becomes pretty clear early on to the viewer but not the characters. Watching them flounder around with clues glaring them in the face was unbearably frustrating.",1418601600,,194,5.5
6284454,4,B00IORPRJK,Excellent movie!,1418083200,,16,7.5
6284455,5,B00IORPRJK,"Excellent movie. It fits right in there with Triangle and Time Crimes as great, complex movies where, if you just sit back and watch it, most everything gets explained at the end in a very satisfying way. The inevitable group of young, attractive people all have well delineated characters and are all fun to watch. I have no idea why so many reviewers are so negative about this one.",1417132800,,384,4.579710144927536
6284456,3,B00IORPRJK,This one might be worth you watching.  It was different that's for sure.,1416614400,,72,4.538461538461538
6284457,4,B00IORPRJK,"Surpringly good. Don't read about what it is, and just enjoy it.",1416355200,,64,4.416666666666667
6284458,4,B00IORPRJK,"Mine Games biggest asset is it's impressively talented and attractive cast but I enjoyed the film as a whole as well. It's very much a psychological thriller with a little bit of slashing going on, as well as a mystery.

The mystery of course is revealed in the twist that you see building during the duration of the film. Joseph Cross is such an under rated actor,he portrays the schizophrenic Michael who may or may or be taking his meds!

There were a few effects and they were done very nicely. I found it to be entertaining and thought provoking even though, yes,we've seen similar plots before.",1415750400,6,600,4.598130841121495
6284459,4,B00IORPRJK,"Not a bad movie! We thought it would be a C grade, low budget film, but it was quite fun.",1414281600,2,89,3.5
6284460,2,B00IORPRJK,"Mine Games was basically the movie Triangle...except not on a ship...and not even half as good. I recognized Briana Evigan's deep voice right away, and though the acting was decent the story was too recycled and yawn-worthy. The ending was disappointing, to say the least. It was at least watchable, so that's worthy of 2 stars. If you end up watching Mine Games and actually like it, try watching the movie Triangle with Melissa George. It's a billion times better.",1414281600,3,466,4.8375
8644257,3,B00IORPRJK,"I am not really sure why I went for 3 stars here but I will stick with it for now. We have 7 friends going to the country to meet 2 other friends and have a wonderful weekend. I liked the cast even though sometimes I was annoyed by some of them and the personnas. We have a very attractive cast (aren't they always?) One girl is some kind of psychic and sees visions but is always to wiped out to tell the others what she sees. Now without giving things away in case you actually see this movie, I am not quite sure if this is all illusion, time paradox or just overactive imaginations. The film itself was very dark since it was filmed a lot in a mine shaft.  Therefore I did miss out on a lot of what happened in the mine, I could not see it. I am not sure that I would say that you should see it but maybe give it a try, it isn't terrible but not exactly memorable either.",1502236800,,875,3.943502824858757
8644258,1,B00IORPRJK,"More than half of this movie was a flat, slow, build that has zero pay off. The movie ""gets going"" in the last 20 minutes, but if you've made it that far you probably wouldn't miss anything by just turning it off.",1500249600,,213,4.095238095238095
8644259,4,B00IORPRJK,"Kind of predictable, then again it's not. Very well done.",1475971200,,57,4.8

8644261,3,B00IORPRJK,"Not the BEST but not the WORST. If you've seen the movie The Triangle it's EXACTLY like this movie (The Traingle was set on an ocean liner)
The movie is good, but around minutes 49 I realized what was happening and said ""DUH!"" and the rest was REALLY easy to figure out. If you like thriller/ psychological movies this one is a good watch. If you like horror/ ghosts not so much...",1462665600,,381,4.305555555555555
8644262,3,B00IORPRJK,"I expected another teens-in-the-woods-with-a-madman-loose movie. This is not at all what this movie is. It is much more cerebral and paranormal than a teen slasher flick. In fact there is very little gore - but the usual teen sex/drinking you'd expect, not a big deal to me.
I was pleasantly surprised to be more entertained by this film than I thought it would be - you do actually have to pay attention and there is a real plot line, unlike a lot of movies aimed at this demographic. Not great, but not bad for a rainy day.",1456358400,,525,4.422680412371134
8644263,4,B00IORPRJK,"Good movie. Well filmed and acted. It had a good story, but it was missing something in the ending. In short it never truly explains what exactly happened. It sort of leaves it up to the viewer to decide what happened.",1452988800,2,218,4.341463414634147
8644264,5,B00IORPRJK,"This is the kind of movie you can (and should) watch more than once because it is such a mind-bender. It keeps you guessing the first time, but after you've seen it and find out what's what, you can rewatch it pick up on things you didn't realize before. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Me and my bf were talking about it for days afterwards.",1446768000,3,341,4.2615384615384615
8644265,4,B00IORPRJK,"The special effects utilized in ""Mine Games"" are tight. There isn't an exploitative nature to the gore or deaths, but what is scene on film comes across realistic looking. The shadowy nature and fact that almost all of the scenes are in nearly dark areas, or at night, gives the film most of it's spooky quality. The cinematography hearkens back to more traditional methods of straight cam shots, light inflections and natural third person views. With all the gimmicky, modern methods of handhelds, shaky cam shots, or first person view points, it is nice to see some aspects of classic horror story telling style still used. Not that I have a problem with fresh, innovative filming techniques like first person POV or found-footage.

Overall ""Mine Games"" gives us a great nightmare scenario that is well executed. The story is creepy, creative and cerebral. It will not appeal to all horror fans, and there is plenty to get the intellectuals stirred up, with the whole time/space-Ouroboros aspects of the story. Personally I spent a lot of the film wondering what exactly was the real deal happening- was it a ""Soul Survivors"" situation or was it a take similar to ""Triangle"". Once I caught up with the true nature of the hell these guys were dealing with I was still compelled to the story. It does weaken a bit toward the end after the big reveal. Not much though, and the time until the ending-when it all becomes clear- isn't all that long, so ""Mine Games"" works pretty much from start to finish.",1431907200,3,1501,4.75095785440613
8644266,2,B00IORPRJK,"This flick feels so much like the Friday the 13th (2009) reboot for the first 20 minutes.  Not only because modern day Julianna Guill (The Apparition, Altitude) is in it--and playing pretty much the same exact role--but because of the nice log cabin McMansion in the woods they go to for a 20-something vacation.  Our 20-somthing group includes the classic Cabin in the Woods (2012) roles of the athlete, the scholar, the fool (stoner), the virgin (in this case, shes a self-proclaimed spiritually sensitive medium; Rebecca Da Costa), the whore (Guills role), and one extra female role in which fellow modern day Briana Evigan (The Devils Carnival, Mothers Day, Sorority Row) plays the straight, serious, concerned girlfriend of a guy who needs to take his meds for something that is never explainedmaking him something of a wild card role.

This group is deep in the mountainous woods for a little vacation and partying in a remote location.  In the early scenes they drink (some doing so all the time), try to sleep with one another, do drugs, and discover an abandoned mine.  This cookie-cutter set up plus two scream queens, along with the fact that we had a sex scene in the first 15 minutes signal us that we are not in for anything deep, original, or intellectually stimulating.  This should be a typical, formulaic VideoOnDemand/Direct-to-DVD horror-by-numbers, right?  Actuallynot quite.

Yes, this movie started out like the Playboy channel was hosting a Coors Light commercial, but we get hints that this will turn out to be something more.  Our medicated character has dreams that take place in an abandoned mine shaft, our medium sees spirits and the characters venture into the mines to encounter echoes from the future about their fate.  Seems like our story is trying to break out of the cookie-cutter mold.

This twisty-turny plot clearly tries and, in premise alone, maybe there was something theresomething that could have been good.  However, the execution left me desperately wanting something more substantial.  Itll make you think and become hopeful after you lumber through the first act.  I just doubt that the thinking will lead you to a satisfying outcome.  Whats more is where the execution of this would-be decent premise has failed, the special effects and acting take no part in remedying such malady.  The characters make dumb decisions that hardly make sense and even though the story leaves nothing to the imagination, the end still doesnt necessarily fit the story.

I have no idea whyand I couldn't be troubled to look up the reasonbut I knew about this movie for a couple years yet was only able to find it on Netflix and Amazon recently.  Its listed as a 2012 movie, but I don't know who (of the generally movie-going public) saw it before this year.  I guess its nothing important enough to discuss, though.  Just another horror movie unworthy of a theatrical release at the end of the day.  It probably had difficulty picking up support somewhere along the process line leading to its release.  The same seems to be happening to 7500 (2014, but I knew about it already in 2012 and was looking for it then), which has still not been released in the US but, from what I hear, were not missing out on much despite the provocative trailer.

When all is said and done, Id advise skipping this one.  You might find some positive reviews, but the reviews are all over the place (evenly distributed from 1 to 5 stars on Amazon).  The best quality of this movie is the unreached potential of its premise.",1426809600,2,3535,4.832225913621262
