5271891,5,B0095XHTMK,"Ruth is one of my favorite books of the Bible. The story of how Naomi and her Moabite daughter-in-law, Ruth, were redeemed by their kinsman, Boaz, is a wonderful foreshadowing of the salvation of all who accept Jesus Christ. There are depths to this tiny book that still can't be plumbed even after repeated study.

This past summer some friends invited my wife and I to take a trip to Lancaster, PA to see a performance of ""Moses"" at the Sight and Sound Theatres complex and we were thoroughly impressed. After the show I happened to see the DVD of the theater's production of Ruth for sale at one of the gift shops but opted not to purchase it at the time and it's been on my ""must buy"" list ever since. This week I spotted the DVD at a local Christian book store and finally grabbed it.

This DVD captures one of the live performances of Ruth which was featured at the Millennium Theatre at Sight and Sound from 2005 through 2006. The leads are Dina Hamilton as Naomi, Leslie Talley as Ruth, and David Felty as Boaz. All three actors give strong performances. I'm not a big fan of musicals but I actually enjoyed all of the songs. God is praised and honored from start to finish of this production. I was following along and thanking the Lord from the bottom of my heart for rescuing me and being my Kinsman-Redeemer. Writer, Jeff Bender, added several non-biblical story elements that are reasonable and often illuminating. I had wondered why Naomi didn't immediately claim her kinsman-redeemer upon her return to Bethlehem and the play proposes a believable explanation. Also, the Hebrews' undoubtedly strong prejudice against Ruth, the Moabite foreigner, which is referenced only indirectly in the biblical text, is a major story element. The sound, camera work, and editing for this DVD are top notch. I'm very, very impressed. For a little more than $20 the viewer has the absolute best seat in the house. The only drawback to this DVD is the subpar picture definition. The picture quality is comparable to a VHS tape; it's a little disappointing and distracting but not earth-shattering. There's not much in the way of bonus features but there is a nice ""featurette"" comprised of interviews with the writer and lead actors.

If you've never seen a show at Sight and Sound in Lancaster or Branson, MO I strongly urge you to do so. You won't be disappointed. But DVDs of the S&S productions are economical, entertaining, and inspirational options. In some respects (like the close-ups of the leads) it's even better than being there. Ruth was the very first Sight and Sound production to be made available on DVD. There are also DVDs for ""In the Beginning"" (2007-2009), ""Joseph"" (2010-2011), ""Jonah"" (2012), and ""Noah"" (2013). Hopefully S&S made improvements in the picture quality for those DVDs.",1420070400,,2804,4.789256198347108
5271892,5,B0095XHTMK,"Sight and Sound creates wonderful plays depicting scripture. They bring to life scenes from the Bible though not exactly as the scriptures speak. However, the theme and the message is clear. You will want to watch also the messages about the scenes and the actors. This is a must. Ruth is our favorite book in the Bible.
This DVD was received on Wed. Nov. 19th and we viewed it that very night. Thanks very much!",1416441600,,412,4.506666666666667
5271893,4,B0095XHTMK,"A wonderful Biblical story told in words and song!  All four of the Sight and Sound productions I have seen ""live"" have been amazing!  This DVD production was almost as enjoyable, and available at a more affordable price.  And, the ""close-up"" scenes on the DVD version are an added bonus that is, of course, not possible at the live productions.",1412208000,,345,4.716666666666667

8536251,4,B0095XHTMK,"While a great deal of poetic license (and a wee bit of bawdiness) is employed, this production is entertaining and seems generally faithful to the Old Testament's Book of Ruth, who was to become David's great-grandmother (Theological shortcoming: One song seemed to infer that deceased humans become angels.).",1508025600,,309,5.458333333333333
8536252,5,B0095XHTMK,"Sight and Sound Theater is quite impressive. Additional things are added to make a story that the actors can play. It does follow the Biblical narrative  closely. I like it that when Naomi tries to send Orpah, and Ruth away. They both want to stay. I have seen several movie adaptations that have this all wrong! In the movies I have seen, they make it seem like Orpah had a grudge against Naomi. The Bible says ""And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people."" So Sight and Sound follows what the Bible actually says here! While Hollywood just butchers up scripture in their portrayals. I am glad I have this DVD!",1502409600,,639,4.461538461538462

I loved the dvd and look forward to buying other Sight & Sound productions on DVD!!!!!!",1478908800,,317,4.56140350877193

8536258,5,B0095XHTMK,"My personal favorite (of all the Sight & Sound productions). The final scene, depicting Ruth's place (along with many other ""unlikely"" people) in the lineage of Jesus, is unforgettable! This is a story worth watching--and telling--again and again. Unfortunate circumstances CAN be overcome and transformed into something powerfully redemptive!",1455494400,,343,6.020408163265306
