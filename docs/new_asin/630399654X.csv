The third chapter introduces us to Skuld, Belldandy's younger sister, who, in addition to being a goddess, has quite a knack for building and fixing mechanical devices, and is addicted to ice cream. (She is also nicely voiced by Pamela Weidner.) Skuld has grown lonely since her two older sisters left heaven to be with Keiichi on earth, and so one day she materializes in the young college student's home...into a rather awkward situation. (No, I won't say what it is. I hate spoilers.) Skuld is angry with Keiichi for the wish he made that now binds Belldandy to him, which has her initially acting hostile twords him.
There's more to part three, however. In each episode, Belldandy and Keiichi's relasionship is threatened in some way. In the last chapter, for example, where we first met Urd, the oldest goddess sister gave Keiichi a love potion meant to get him to express his true feelings to Belldandy. But then in walked Sayoko, a stuck-up rival girl, and soon Belldandy found him confessing love to Sayoko.
This time, Keiichi is to take part in a bike race with a rival motor club. According to a bet his friends made, (without his consent, of course,) if he loses, Belldandy will have to become the girlfriend of Ayoshima, a rich, snobbish member of the rival club.
To sum it all up, this is a fine addition to a great series, and one that any OMG fan should see.",1022630400,,1582,4.554385964912281
