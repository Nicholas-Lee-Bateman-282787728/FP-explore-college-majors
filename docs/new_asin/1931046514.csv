It was complicated and there was too much talking with no simple exercise routine to follow.  However, I managed to filter out five different exercise routines for me to use.",1484092800,,269,5.090909090909091
7801448,5,1931046514,I love all of Dan Johns stuff.  This has a ton of warm up ideas and exercises.  Perfect for trainers and coaches of athletes...,1361836800,2,127,4.25
7801449,5,1931046514,"Dan John is on point with this information. He give great advice on how to conduct group setting warm-ups and how to hit all the major points of corrective exercise while still giving the client / athlete what they want and need. I highly recommend this video by Dan to anyone working with athletes, weekend warriors, or group training sessions.",1322179200,2,345,4.766666666666667
7801450,5,1931046514,"Imagine that you are at the gym and you run into a guy who has the equivalent of a lifetime PhD in exercise physiology and working out and he is kind enough to help you out.  Pop this into your computer or DVD player and that's just what it's like. It's a deceptively simple video of the highlights of a Dan John seminar in strength training work-outs.

  Any of the exercises he teaches to participants can be incorporated into your own fitness routines. The ones he terms warm-ups are not stretches but are useful routines with a dumb-bell or other weight. He illustrates and explains each exercise thoroughly,and it is helpful to then watch the male and female class participants do them (class members of various fitness and experience levels and all ages, including age 60+).

  The exercises are not complicated, and he has a talent for highlighting a key point or two about technique to help you develop proper form and execution. As with all Dan John material there is so much to pick from, I find I watch a bit of the video and then race off to my dumb-bells and try out what I've just learned. I have yet to make it through the complete video--which is a good thing!

  The disc also contains a small PDF file that outlines a mens and womens workout complete with warm-ups, ab circuit, and barbell complexes. The exercises will improve your balance (something many weight-lifting and other programs skimp on), flexibility, strength, posture and breathing.",1295049600,6,1465,4.709803921568628
