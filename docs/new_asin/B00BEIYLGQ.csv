5584377,2,B00BEIYLGQ,"This movie is somewhat informative, but not as fun as expected from its title. It traces back the roots of the song, but kind of ends there. I wanted more and to learn more about associated dances, weddings, future, etc., but it never comes. I wouldn't spend more than $.99 for it if I were you.",1388966400,,295,4.285714285714286
5584378,5,B00BEIYLGQ,Full of humor and wonderful information. Smiled through the entire movie. It's the whole history and sociology of Hava Nagila.,1387756800,,126,5.35
5584379,5,B00BEIYLGQ,"What an upbeat, fascinating, utterly entertaining movie!  What I thought most interesting about the movie was how the assimilation of Jews in America was linked to Hava Nagila, and how many different types of singers, musicians, entertainers now embrace the song - well beyond the Jewish community.  Well done movie.",1384646400,2,316,5.3
5584380,5,B00BEIYLGQ,"Laugh out loud funny, uplifting, and informative. I viewed the film at the CCA in Santa Fe, NM. The entire audience was laughing. Smiles and positive comments from all.",1371340800,,168,4.827586206896552
5584381,5,B00BEIYLGQ,"This movie previewed at KlezKamp, held annually during Christmas week (when else?)in the Catskills (where else?) One section was filmed a KlezKamp 2011. I laughed til I cried. The work brings up so many memories of Bar Mitzvahs and weddings, and alot of the stars of the '50s and '60's who recorded Hava Nagila, successfully and not so successfully. Why do many Jews, especially those who are musicians, hate and resent this song? Find out!",1364688000,3,440,4.88
8566996,5,B00BEIYLGQ,"This is an educational, respectful and highly amusing look at the Jewish song&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hava-Nagila/dp/B000S42768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hava Nagila</a>.  The film traces the song back to the Sadigorer Hasidim in Russia, follows it to Israel, and then to the United States, where it became a staple at Jewish weddings and bar mitzvah celebrations after World War II. There is a very funny segment on the exodus of American Jews from the cities to the suburbs, including a lovely bar mitzvah video that was either from the 50s or 60s, and a short TV clip of Allan Sherman singing ""Here's To The Crabgrass"".  There are also lots of clips of singers and musicians performing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hava-Nagila/dp/B00R1YAY04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hava Nagila</a>, such as Harry Belafonte, Connie Francis, Glen Campbell, Irving Fields, and Bob Dylan. (Oh, and let's not forget Chubby Checkers twisting to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hava-Nagela/dp/B007HI9IRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hava Nagela</a>.) I think the movie could have done without some of the clips of really weird performances of the song, such as Mr. Dylan's, but other than that, it was a delightful film.  The only problem with watching it is now I can't get the song out of my head, along with an Allan Sherman song.  No, not the crabgrass one that was in this movie, but his most famous one . . .&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hello-Muddah-Hello-Fadduh-A-Letter-From-Camp-Granada/dp/B005HHVCNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hello Muddah Hello Fadduh - A Letter From Camp Granada</a>.

8566997,4,B00BEIYLGQ,Well-done! Mix of fact & sociological opinion on the history & cultural impact of that ubiquitous song. Funny too! Probably audience-limited though.,1420070400,,148,5.7727272727272725

8567000,5,B00BEIYLGQ,"Who knew that a movie about a song could be so entertaining?!  The song has a long and rich worldwide history that is explored thoroughly but in a very interesting, at times, humorous way.",1400544000,,188,4.529411764705882
8567001,3,B00BEIYLGQ,Kind of like listening to your Zayde tell Shtetl stories.  Fascinating subject.  You know it's an important part of your heritage.  But there is just not enough information to fill the allotted time.,1393891200,,199,4.96969696969697
8567002,5,B00BEIYLGQ,"We all know about the ancient roots of ""Hava Nagila,"" right?  This great documentary sets us straight on this issue ... and everything else about this quintessential Jewish party song, this cheerful celebration of our ethnicity, this beloved symbol of a hope that was realized in 1948.  Quintessential? --- not in all circles.  Cheerful? --- not to the combatants in the struggle for attributed authorship.  Beloved? --- not to many Yiddishists.  You'll laugh!  You'll cry!  Most of all, you'll be entertained!",1393459200,,510,5.222222222222222
8567003,4,B00BEIYLGQ,It was entertaining but all the hype about it before seeing it left me a little disapointed. Still Hava Nagila the movie was good. Four out of five stars.,1393027200,,154,4.344827586206897
