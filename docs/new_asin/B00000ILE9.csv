1222682,5,B00000ILE9,OK the 4 discs in this set are great ..... They had been digitally remastered THX sound and the video is better than the first disks that came out with the individual movie .... BUT .... if you are an aficionado of both the Alien series and of video DVD's then don'y buy this set but kick out double the bucks to buy the 2003 Alien Quadrilogy .... There are tons of new sceneces on that set AND most importantly all the movies were reworked and are BRIGHTER CRISPER and well just plain unbelievable ....,1093305600,8,503,4.3052631578947365
1222683,3,B00000ILE9,"The first two movies are outstanding. Ridley Scott does a magnificent job on the first one. The first movie scares you because you are first introduced to the Aliens and the settings are incredible. The cast is good and you can't help wondering who will survive. Even though they only battle a single Alien they have very limited weapons. No assualt rifles, just flame guns they improvise with in their shop. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley the heroine is remarkable. If you don't like people being defenseless you may not enjoy this as much as Aliens. After all it is pretty much a smorgasbord for the Alien, and the crew is the menu. Ian Holm as the robot Ash is determined not to let Ripley kill the Alien.

The second movie, Aliens, on the other hand is riveting non stop action. James Cameron does a fantastic job of turning the tables a bit on the Aliens. Here the humans actually stand a chance of surviving because they come armed for bear. This is a detachment of Marines and not some mining expediton like the original. They aren't here to study, they are here to kick some serious Alien booty. My favorite of this series because I like survivors not going down without a fight. A good deal more insight into the Aliens and their method of reproduction. The fight between Lt. Ripley and the queen will keep you glued to your seat. Michael Biehn is a nice touch as Cpl. Hicks, a Marine with a heart. Lance Henriksen as the robot is great. He shows Ripley that some robots can be trusted.

The third movie was bit hard to take. Okay landing on a prison planet is interesting, but why kill off all but Ripley from the last movie? Even her cat that survived the first two. That's was a low blow indeed. I had become attached to the characters that survived the second movie, so that put a sour taste in my mouth right from the beginning. It seems they wanted to make it more like the first movie by only having defenseless quarry for the Alien again. Yum yum lots of defenseless prisoners for the Alien. Rather than have an Alien baby, Sigourney even takes her own life. How do you spell depressing?

In the fourth movie we find that Ripley is back because she has been cloned. They need her after all to mother a hybrid Alien. The humans are not quite totally defenseless but it is still pretty much another smorgasbord for the Alien. Ripley is pretty much a puppet for the military wanting to create a new weapon. So once again since the first movie the corporations want the Alien to survive even if it kills indescriminately. Once again she dies taking out the last Alien. Good effects, fair acting, lousy story.

Fans of the second movie may be a little disappointed in the new Alien vs. Predator movie released today. I went to see it since I loved the first two movies in this collection and the first two Predator movies. Fans of the first Alien movie will like it since it has plenty of suspense but there is not much of a chance of survival for the group that goes to investigate the temple. I was a bit disappointed because a couple of the people that I thought might be survivors don't make it. Only one does like in the first movie. I was also not happy about how a couple of the Predators seemed to fall victim so easily since considering their arsenal of toys, of which invisibility was rarely used, made it seem they wanted to show the Aliens tougher than what I think they are against a Predator.",1092355200,3,3414,4.440191387559809
1222684,4,B00000ILE9,"Ridley Scott's classic film spawned a whole new subgenre of films and resurrected the monster on the loose b-movie all within a tight, two hour horror film. Yes, folks I called it a horror film. The trappings are science fiction but not much more. In reality Alien is a remake of It The Terror Beyond Space. Dan O'Bannon's script took the same basic premise and decorated it with an entire alien culture and spieces so different from human culture and much more predatory that it helped create a bumper crop of films for the next twenty years.
To be honest, the final film cut much of O'Bannon's most creative aspects of the script. It was simplified by Walter Hill and David Giler to the point that O'Bannon wasn't even sure he wanted credit at one point. Still, it works because Hill and Giler like Scott recognized that the core story idea would be fun. Let's lock everyone in a spaceship millions of miles after from Earth with a creature that appears invincible. Introduce a plot variation on 10 Little Indians and you've got a solid hit on your hands.
The transfer of Alien is very good and the interactive menu fairly easy to use. The sound has also been mixed for the first time for 5.1 Digital surround. That's a bit plus as the original was in stereo. There's also the inclusion of the famous cut scene where Ripley finds out what really happened to Dallas and the other crew members. It literally stopped the movie cold in previews which is why it was excised. Add to that the stunning trailers (for both television and theaters) and you've got a solid package worth having.
Most sequels are little more than placeholders in the franchise. Aliens was an exception to that rule. Every bit as different and as good as the original film that inspired it, it could be aruged that Aliens was actually superior to the first film. While Ridley Scott's classic haunted house movie (it may be set in space but, really folks it's a haunted house movie)is a great, tight horror movie, James Cameron's sequel builds on the character of Ripley and turns the first film's premise on its head; by the end of the film Ripley is every bit the predator going after the Alien queen.
The extras include an interview with James Cameron. I might also add that this is the expanded edition that appeared on laserdisc. The story is much richer and plays better with the added scenes. There's more depth to the characters and the sense of irony as to the fate of Burke is deepened. The sound is terrific and the transfer, again, very good.
With Alien 3 the series took a sharp decline. That's not due to director David Fancher but, instead, to the streamlined script. Originally director Vincent Ward was set to direct and he envisioned Alien 3 set on a monastary world. The switch to a prison planet doesn't gel quite as well. The rewrites and decision to ""end"" the series undermine much of the film. The decisions made as to the fates of the other survivors was also miscalculated. Still, Alien 3 has a number of strongly directed sequences and the CGI Alien adds a new, unpredictable element to the mix.
Finally we get to Alien Resurrection. It's not a bad idea. The scripting is clever and has many tongue in cheek moments. Unfortunately, the film doesn't come together as well as the first two films. Many of the scripting decisions work quite well but the casting is questionable. Joss Whedon's script is literate and intelligent with just the right attitude given this is the fourth installment in this series.
The transfer looks very good and, again, the sound is terrific. AR is a step up from A3 and a vast improvement in the area of the script.
Overall for the whole series--4 stars. 4 1/2 for Alien; 5  for Aliens; 2 for Alien 3 and 3 for Alien Resurrection. To give the producers credit, the entire series has held up quite well. It's a pity that the opportunity to do more with 3 and 4 wasn't realized.",1060214400,4,3902,4.582260371959943
1222685,5,B00000ILE9,"Easily my favorite film franchise ever made.
 A truly amazing quadrilogy.

 Alien - The first installment in the series. It's a little on the slow side, and maybe even a little boring at times, but still a good movie none the less. It's sets up the rest of the series.
 MAKE SURE TO WATCH THIS BEFORE THE OTHERS!
 I saw 'Aliens' before this one, and it pretty much ruined this one for me. I knew what was going to happen.
 But overall, still a good film.
 Easily the scariest of the ""Legacy"".

 Aliens - The best film ever made. Period.
 It's absolutely perfect and flawless.
 I love this film.
 The casting is great (Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henrikson, Paul Reiser, Carrie Henn, Jenette Goldstein - all perfect for their roles.), the directing is perfect (James Cameron), the special effects are visually stunning, and the story is one of the best ever written.

 A very different film then '",1059868800,,986,4.6395348837209305
1222704,5,B00000ILE9,"The Alien Movies are indeed some of the greatest sci-fi movies to come out in the late 1970's.  This DVD set in particular shows the movies in the best way possible, the DVD format. The second movie Aliens, which other reviewers have mentioned as having a ""grainy"" picture and therefore leading the people to believe that this transfer was not a good transfer, are very mistaken. The Director James Cameron filmed the movie like this to add more of an effect. But in since this is the only one out of the four to have a high definition transfer also makes it the best out of the four. Also, the movie has 17 minutes of footage from the laserdisc version. So, while the DVD box states that the footage is brand new, it is if you don't already own the laserdisc version. The other special features include interview with James Cameron and interesting shorts on the making of the queen alien.
  Alien, the first movie includes a documentary and deleted scenes. The best by far is an early ""Cocoon Scene"", this shows an early version of the cocooning by the Alien in which is shown in greater detail in the second movie. Alien also contains original isolated scores which for a person interested in sound or film production is quite interesting. Alien also contains 500 production photos and artwork, posters, theatrical trailers, TV spots. It also contains a very well done commentary by Ridley Scott, the director of Alien. The commentary is very good and worth listening to one of the best directors in movie history.
  The third movie Alien 3 is still a good movie but not as good as the first two is still a decent movie. The fourth movie Alien Resurrection is perhaps the most horrible because it had to find a way of bringing back the main character, which the story itself strays, way too far off track and really doesn't fit that well into the other three also because of so many loopholes in the story as well. The special features on these two DVD's only offer trailers and the third movie offers a ""making of "". The picture and letterboxing is all your truly getting out of the these two DVD's. This box set as a whole is worth it. The widescreen ratios are all 2.35:1 for the first, third and fourth movies while, Aliens has a 1.85:1 ratio.  Alien and Aliens are the only two worth buying unless your a fan of the movies then by all means buy the box set. But also since I'm writing this review in light of 20th century fox is putting out a 9 disc collector's box called ""Alien Quadrilogy"". This will feature Alien 3 in its 2 hour 50 minute cut and Aliens in two different cuts the theatrical version and the Director's cut offered on this version of Aliens. The fourth movie will also get an alternate beginning and ending. So, while you probably still can find a copy of this great set it's better to wait for the 9 disc ""Alien Quadrilogy"" later in the year in October of 2003.",1055030400,11,2888,4.480988593155893
1222705,5,B00000ILE9,"I've never been a Sigourney weaver fan, and I honestly think she helped make the last 2 movies stink more than they should have, but the second movie in this series Aliens is one of my all-time favorite classics. The special edition has a ton of new scenes that make it very enjoyable to watch, even though I've seen the original cut probably 30 or 40 times now.
If you do not own any of the Alien movies but were as fascinated by HR Giger's art and alien creation as I was, you must get this movie set. If you were as underwhelmed with the last 2 movies in the series as I was, then keep in mind that you will also get a ton of special content in the form of design sketches, deleted scenes, graphics, concept art, etc which can take an hour or more to browse through. All in all, even though the last 2 movies in the series are barely ratable at 2 stars, overall the series is worth purchasing in one piece and enjoying all in one sitting in some dark night at home alone.",1052006400,2,974,4.131578947368421

1222707,5,B00000ILE9,"ALIEN - movie that started it all. It introduces Sigourney Weaver as Ripley-a woman destined to battle the galaxy's ultimate creature. Crew of Nostromo investigates a transmission from an unknown planet and discovers a life form that breeds within a human host.
ALIENS - Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, the only survivor of Nostromo. Face with difficulty to explain the faith of the ship and it's crew to the Company, Ripley joins a team of marines to investigate a mysterious disappearance of colonists on LV-426.
ALIEN3 - Once again the lone survivor, Ripley awakes on Fiorina 161, wasteland populated only with maximum security prison inmates. Unfortunately, she was not the only life form on the space ship. And this time she is the host.
ALIEN RESURACTION - After 200 years and 8 horrific experiments later Ripley is back. A group of scientists clone her along with the alien queen inside her in hopes to create bread of ultimate weapons.
These are the most original, powerful and terrifying films in Sci-fi history.

The second film, ""Aliens"" was utterly brilliant. It was non-stop action and it was a great success with fans. How could they top this one?
They couldn't.
Well, with the third film, ""Alien 3"", they basically gave us a rehash of the first film but changed the setting. What's worse is that they used the goodwill that the second film created and spent hardly anything on special effects or sets. This was a boring and huge disappointment for fans.
The fourth film, ""Alien Resurrection"" improved on the third one and was fun but no where near as good as ""Aliens"".
The boxset is a great idea for fans of the saga and has alot of interesting things that you can enjoy about the making of the films.
I would have given this boxset a higher rating but the third film really, really disappointed me and this is one of the few times that I would have liked to demand my money back from the theater.",1044230400,,1041,4.398963730569948

No need to go into my thoughts on the various movies in this set. Regardless of whether one was better than another is really pointless at this time. Im quite sure the movie sales spoke for themselves and the executives know where they made their mistakes. But lets face it one thing they did do with great precision was to keep Siquorney Weaver in all 4. Without her I probably would have called it quits after the first 2. If you cant get the original stars back in a movie then move on to something else, its just not the same without the original actor.. Death being the exception of course :).

1222711,4,B00000ILE9,"ive aged since these movies have come out.  and my thoughts on them have changed.  when i saw aliens in the theater (i was 13), it was incredible.  when i saw alien3 in the theater (i was 19) i wasn't too impressed.  now im 30 and have reversed my opinions.
we all agree that ridley scott created something special with the first installment.  it was a breed apart, created its own subgenre, and was entertaining as all hell.  sigourney weaver shaped a hero unlike any other at the time.  30 years old, female, getting her hands dirty while maintaining her feminity, classic and irreplaceable.
cameron's aliens is to me the weak link.  is it scary? yes. does it hold to the alien theme? yes.  but it was in essence bland.  one dimensional characters with guns.  weaver plays ripley with all the maternal fear, love, and rage she can muster and does it well.  but otherwise, just goons and guns. acceptable hollywood fare, but the series begs to be more.
like i said i originally wasn't smitten with fincher's alien3.  but since then ive dug seven, and fight club, so i was stoked to give this one another chance.  and it blew me away.  fincher is creative in his camera work, but only to the benefit of the movie.  the characters have histories, some of which we learn, others we dont.  granted, a number of them hardly have lines so its hard to care about them, but the primary cast of players deliver a movie with wit, depth, humanity, and of course, fear. weavers ripley plumbs new depths of character and pushes what shes established even further.  a 42 year old female hero with sensitivity, and calloused knuckles is a rare find and welcome. fincher made some bold moves with this one.  many of which were cut in the theater but returned in the dvd release.  those revived scenes are more than likely a big part of why the movie works now, but didn't then.  just goes to show, that often times, its the risks that make a movie worthwhile.  alien3 was dark, moody, and scary as hell ... thats what alien is all about.
juenet's earlier films had thier own style, some of which can be attributed to his partnership with producer caro.  and it was likely that style wouldve been too much for alien - resurrection.  but he managed to keep a creative eye on the camera but not let it get out of hand.  the fourth alien movie had all the substance to get the fluid and gothic mood rolling, but maintained the depth of choice characters and occasional surprises in the storyline.  its a movie true to the spirit of the original with dark and forbidding scenes, but successfully kept it fresh with new ideas.  and of course weavers return as ripley.  it goes without saying at this point that ripley is one of the true great and original ""heros"" of film, largely due to weavers impeccable ability to fuse together so many elements into one character.  the fact that she continues to do so while they add more and more facets to her is astounding and refreshing.
this dvd release does them all great justice.  i was only reminded of the age of the first film by the opening 20th century fox film logo.  they are clean and clear and well mixed.  puts the movie right back in your lap like in the theaters.  the bonus features are lacking.  but i tend to expect that in older films.  they didn't necessarily know when making 'em that they needed 3 hours of behind the scenes did they :)  that said, the featurettes they have are welcome and fun.",1041638400,7,3439,4.481481481481482

1222722,4,B00000ILE9,"I've been a slobbering Alien fanatic since age six, and Aliens made its theatrical debut.  Mmm, I can still recall the thrill of every slapped ammunition clip, every morbid hiss and the wicked cacaphony of machine gun fire.
Anyway, personally, I bought this because - well duh - its the Alien series.  The pros are that I have my prized DVD collection in a nice little box.  The cons are that it came packaged with a lump of [poo] called  Alien: Resurrection.  Personally, I've always looked down on people for their dim view on Alien 3.  It made a perfect circle, I thought, to the series.  Everything was fairly nicely wrapped up in an intriguing and fittingly depressing conclusion.  The fourth film, however, was such a pathetic attempt I wish it hadn't been made.  The impressive cast aside (although it certainly wasn't Ron Perlman's pinnacle as an actor.  ""So, like, what'd you do?"") there were very few saving graces, and Buffy's Joss Whedon needs to check his head if he even thinks for a second that he's ever going to be Aliens material.  He needs to stick where he belongs: television.
Anyway, given that this is only the price of 3 DVDs, you're basically getting the fourth one for free, so I strongly suggest it, just as I strongly suggest burning the fourth installment and sending it to Joss Whedon with a picture of his dog being sodomized by a kimodo dragon.",1037404800,6,1376,4.644628099173554
1222723,4,B00000ILE9,"I've watched all four films and I have to say the first two were the best. The first, Alien, was a fantastic (for it's time, 1979)Sci-Fi Horror movie, with a great plot and ending. Yes, it's graphics and special effects are not up to par with the modern day Digital graphics and million dollar explosions that seem to dominate today's movies, but it takes a creative script and equally good acting/directing to make a movie like this work. That's why Alien succeeded and has such a large fan following to this day.
The sequel, Aliens, directed by James Cameron (Terminator I & II, Titanic) continued the saga of Lt. Ripley and the ""Alien"" in fine style. It is my favorite of the four and has an excellent supporting cast. I'm not going to tell you about it; Just watch it!
So, I've had nothing but good things to say about the first two movies. Why only four stars?  Because the third movie really went down  compared with the first two. I don't think it's because it was really bad, but more because the first two were sooo good, and my expectations for the third episode were high. It turned out to be slow and a little boring. The first two movies were 5-star material; this one only gets 2.5 stars from me.
Unfortunately, the final movie, Alien Resurrection, fails to improve much on the previous movie. Yes, there's definately more action, but Ripley's clone comes infected with the Butch/Slut gene, and makes her character less likable. The script takes much of the blame here. I don't think she was as comfortable in this role. Winona Ryder should have stayed away from this one. Her character softens the plot and generally weakens the whole movie. I struggle to give it 3 stars.
For my money, I would buy Alien and Aliens, instead of the entire legacy. They are two of the best Sci-Fi movies EVER! The last two, I'm sorry to say, are not worth the extra money.",1035158400,5,1869,4.543026706231454

1222725,5,B00000ILE9,"The impact of these films on popular culture cannot be denied. Parodies of the chestburster are found anywhere from Mel Brooks' ""Spaceballs"" to the Nicktoon ""Rocko's Modern Life,"" and the movies themselves have spawned innumerable series of toys, comics, novels, T-Shirts, and crossovers. This is proof of their greatness; spanning over twenty years and driven by such master filmmakers as Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and Joss Whedon, they inspire more than just fear in the viewers (although fear is hardly in short supply). All of them are good, but in very different ways. I will now discuss each of the movies independently.
Alien is, in my opinion, the most uncreative and emotionally weak of the four. I know the hardcore fans will hate me for saying this, but it's true. The plot is not much different from that of the horrible B movies of the '50s, and there's not much emotion except fear. Where this movie truly excels is in how well it is done; the acting is superb, the set designs are awesome, Ridley Scott directed, and H.R. Giger designed the alien monster. But even then, the alien moves very oddly; at one point, it is just waving its arms about randomly while gliding toward its prey. Still, this movie breathed new life into a very dead genre.
Aliens is widely regarded to be the best of the series, and with good reason. At first it dealt with Ripley's newfound distrust of androids, her nightmares about the Alien, and her loss of her daughter; then it moved on to Newt's loss of her parents, developed the relationship between Ripley and Newt, exposed Hicks's softer and more caring side, and ended with Ripley's acceptance of Bishop and hope that both she and Newt could now dream safely. Oh, and there were lots of ugly monsters, too. It was even more well done than the first, with James Cameron designing literally everything - from what the colony looked like to how the aliens moved.
The very underrated Alien 3 took a much darker, more poetic look at things than even the first two. Ripley, emotionally devastated by the loss of the other Aliens survivors (especially Newt), finds herself socially isolated on a colony of ex-cons. Her suspicions that an Alien followed her are laid to rest after an autopsy and cremation of Hicks' and Newt's bodies, but then reaffirmed when inmates start disappearing. Another revelation, that she is carrying a Queen inside herself, only compounds the issue, as she knows that the clock is ticking and she has no hope for survival. Many sequences in this film are beautifully and poetically done, including Dillon's mid-movie speech, Ripley's final plunge to her death, and the way the cremation was synchronized to the birth of the Alien. The music expresses the moods of the movie better than pretty much any other movie I've seen. It has a few minor flaws, mostly with the Alien, which is born almost fully grown and can cling to ceilings as if it was filled with helium. One of my friends commented that it also glows a slight teal when hanging from the ceiling. Use of the F word is a bit excessive.
Alien Resurrection is also highly underrated. Although it was no doubt an ""unnecessary"" addition to the Alien chronology, and is nowhere near as good an ending to the series as Alien 3, it is no less a movie. Following a mutated clone of Ripley, it takes the saga to an extreme of wierdness, delving into Ripley's irreversible connection to the Aliens and her resulting personal identity crisis. Call, the movie's ""token android,"" tags along to raise some deep philosophical questions, which Ripley sometimes turns around back at her. Many moments of this movie deserve pause, especially when Ripley finds out about the... shall we say, less successful experiments. The ending is very emotional; the human/alien hybrid displays both human affection toward Ripley (who it regards as its mother) and inhuman cruelties toward others, and Ripley is forced to make the toughest ethical decision of all the movies. She even tells the creature ""I'm sorry"" and cries as the alien is blown into space, not wanting to cause so much pain in something so human, but having little other choice. The writer, Joss Whedon (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer), criticized the way the movie was done, and he's quite right. The set designs look like someone splashed moldy diarrhea on the walls, the alien effects are messed up in places (like with the eggs taking WAY too long to hatch), and some of the actors look much meaner/sleazier than was really necessary. Still, it has its good points. The Auriga's interiors are staggering in size and very cool-looking, while the music (as per Alien 3) matches whatever the mood is at the time. Also inherited from Alien 3 is slight overuse of the F word.
As a side note, there's something of a logical progression within the first 3 movies. In Alien, Ripley's primary goal is survival, and killing the alien is just a necessary step; in Aliens, she risks her life to save another (and certainly doesn't mind filling the Alien critters with hot lead on the way); and in Alien 3, she sacrifices herself to kill the last of the creatures. Her focus gradually shifts away from keeping herself alive and more toward wiping out the aliens. The fourth movie doesn't really fit into this pattern, she just runs around the ship and blows away monsters. Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you :)
The special features on the DVDs are nothing special. On the last two movies, there's nothing but a ""making of"" featurette and a few trailers. The first two movies have those plus a truckload of concept art and production photos. Only the first movie has deleted scenes. The second has an interview with James Cameron. But come on, these movies put together last over 8 hours, who has time for special features?",1033171200,2,5800,4.777888446215139
1222726,5,B00000ILE9,"Ridley Scott's classic Sci Fi thriller ALIEN is the best of the franchise, no question, no debate, it is the best. Great visuals and special effects from maestro H.R Giger and masterful direction from Scott give the film it's dark, horror-house look. A great performance from Sigourney Weaver and haunting music by Jerry Goldsmith all combine to create one of the greatest Sci Fi films ever made.
James Cameron's gung-ho sequel is a great thrill ride, adorned with menacing Aliens (hats off to Stan Winston, the special effects are brilliant) and an equally menacing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver got an Oscar nomination for the role). The DVD adds more footage including Ripley's discovery that all her family have died since the last film, and although the added scenes tend to slow the pace sometimes, they add to the character, and make the film feel more complete. Great visuals, ear-splitting sound and Cameron's trademark over-the top action
Pre-Fight Club David Fincher directed this misunderstood entry into the Alien franchise. While it's a flawed film, it does touch on some themes that weren't done in the first two, and there are some effectively creepy moments.
The special effects quota reverts back to the original's modus operandi of not showing the aliens as much as James Cameron's ""everything and the kitchen sink"" trademark. Which is rather effective and creepy, utilising the old ""hiding in the shadows"" trick. And Sigourney Weaver is good as the tough-as- nails Ellen Ripley. Still, it's disappointing compared to the first two films, because the action is subdued, the characters are cardboard and the plot is very silly. But there is some good action, and while the nihilistic ending would have seemed to rule out the possibility of a fourth entry, Alien Resurrection carried on the story to bigger, and arguably better effect.
After the lacklustre Alien 3, this visually impressive entry into the Alien franchise is far better than it's predecessor but doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of Ridley Scott's original.
The special effects are the main attraction, including a standout scene with CG aliens in water, and both CGI creations and practical blend seamlessly together.
The action set-pieces are nicely done if overly-gruesome, and with a climax that's a fascinating and fitting end (?) to the series, Alien 4 is well done, if sometimes over-cooked. All put in a terrific DVD box set loaded with extras, this one is a MUST-BUY DVD collection. No questions asked.",1028937600,9,2499,5.097560975609756

1222728,5,B00000ILE9,"I have always been a fan of good (and bad) sci-fi, and the ALIEN series is still my favorite. Previous reviewers have gone over the plots, so I'll try not to do that. The first, ALIEN, was certainly riveting and suspenseful. Ridley Scott made his mark with this film. Sigourney, the ultimate hero, was really an ensemble cast member throughout most of the film, making no character more important than any other. I liked this touch, though the film was really a high-tech remake if ""IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE"". My favorite of the series is ALIENS, the second installment, directed by James Cameron (also, still trying to make his mark in Hollywood). This one also won the most praise and awards, including an Oscar nomination for Sigourney (and 6 others awards). Indeed, Sigourney's performance has more depth and range (the scenes referring to her daughter, left out of the theatrical release & the VHS versions, show a tenderness that is compelling.) The action is unrelenting, almost exhausting; non-stop excitement, due to absolutely brilliant editing (it lost the Oscar for editing to ""PLATOON"", which had one long beautifully edited action scene...this action goes from beginning to end. I would've voted for this one.) Cameron also used Bill Paxton in almost every one of his subsequent films. ""ALIEN 3"" got a bad rap. It's my 2nd favorite in the series. Again, a novice director, David Fincher, showed his flair for dark and brooding venues (later so brilliant in ""SEVEN"" & ""FIGHT CLUB"".) The most interesting thing about this third installment is that the alien was ""bred"" by a dog, and was essentially a mutant variety, one that Ripley couldn't out-guess. Ripley's own impregnation and subsequent demise was handled in a most effective manner. Also, fighting the alien with no weapons was an added challenge, met by a fine director and a stellar cast. The last of the series, ""ALIEN RESURRECTION"" was really only an example of Hollywood trying to capitalize on a successful series. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the plot was a little more than contrived (considering the over-all substance of sci-fi films in general) and didn't get me as involved as the first three. My favorite scene was when the cloned Ripley meets the clones of herself that didn't quite turn out.  I saw all of these films in the theatre in their initial releases. I'm not sure if ALIENS was in a 2.35:1 widescreen, but it's presented here in only a 1.85:1 LBX. The others are all 2.35:1. A lot of people don't like Widescreen, but REAL film fans do, and I can appreciate seeing more of the picture. All of Cameron's other pictures were 2.35:1, and with the big budget he was allowed by Fox, I'm surprised he didn't take advantage of it. Or did he? I honestly don't remember. This whole series has a wonderfully consistant narrative flow; the different styles of the directors add a new touch to each installment. I really love this series.",1026345600,5,2931,4.862
1222729,4,B00000ILE9,"It's great that this set was finally released, even though it lacks special features on the last two in the series. Here's a quick synopsis of the movies:
ALIEN: Scary, exciting, and suspensful sci-fi/horror film which makes a great start to the series. After recieving a signal from a remote planet, Captain Dallas (TOM SKERITT) and his crew (which includes SIGOURNEY WEAVER, IAN HOLM, YAPHET KOTTO, and HARRY DEAN STANTON) land on the planet only to find a derelict spacecraft filled with hundreds of mysterious eggs which have aliens insdie them... soon enough one of the aliens gets inside the ship and all hell brakes loose. Some shots of the alien look very obvious. Comes with many speical features on the DVD. Directed by Ridley Scott. 1979; filmed in 2:35:1 widescreen. RUN TIME: 116 minutes. GRADE: A-.
ALIENS: A visceral, more action oriented/shoot-em-up approach to alien series. 57 years after ""Alien"", Ripley (SIGOURNEY WEAVER) goes back to the planet from the original movie with a squad of marines (which includes MICHAEL BEIHN, BILL PAXTON, and LANCE HENRIKSEN) to wipe out the alien infestation. Soon enough, the marines and Ripley become trapped in the compound and they must find a way out without being killed by the aliens. There are many magnificent action scenes in this movie, but you'd expect that from director James Cameron. Some people may not like that all of the suspense and horror was taken out to make room for shooting. The DVD includes a photo gallery, an interview with the director, and a longer version of the film. 1986; filmed in 1:85:1 widescreen. RUN TIME: 154 minutes. GRADE: B+.
ALIEN 3: Underrated sequel in which Ripley crashes on a planet where there is a huge prison inhabited by ex-cons. Soon enough, Ripley realizes that an alien has somehow gotten in to the prison. Now, Ripley must lead the ex-cons (which includes CHARLES DANCE and CHARLES S. DUTTON) to destroy the beast, but it's more complicated because in the prison there are no weapons of any kind. Director David Fincer (Fight club, Se7en) utilizes the same concepts as director Ridley Scott did in the original movie. There is much bloodshed/gore in this movie and the alien sometimes looks fake, but Alien 3 has by far the best finale of the entire series. 1992; filmed in 2:35:1 widescreen. RUN TIME: 115 minutes. GRADE: B-.
ALIEN RESURRECTION: Interesting but unbelievable sequel has Ripley being cloned with alien DNA on a medical research ship 200 years in the future where experiments on aliens are being performed. Soon enough, the aliens escape and all hell brakes loose (again) on the ship. Ripley, along with a band of smugglers (which includes MICHAEL WINCOTT and RON PERLMAN), a scientist, and a security guard (RAYMOND CRUZ) must make it to an escape ship before they are killed and the ship blows up. Director Jean-Pierre Jeaunet fills the movie with absurd close-ups and gore aplenty, (more than Alien 3) but still manages to create a humorous, action packed movie with some good special effects and chilling music. Some people may not like the ending. 1997; filmed in 2:35:1 widescreen. RUN TIME: 108 minutes. GRADE: C+.
Good series, but I advise you not to buy this set because it lacks special features. There will most likely be a re-release loaded with commentaries, documentaires, etc so just wait for that.
493 minutes; all films are Rated R for scenes of strong violence/gore, frequent strong language, disturbing images, and some sensuality.",1024531200,58,3477,4.965694682675815

Alien 3 had to be one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen, and Alien Resurrection was only made because of the sour taste Alien 3 left in everyone's minds & still it failed to redeem the series.
Alien and Aliens - great couplet; I'd pay for these two DVD's & own them separately.  There is no way in hell I will shell out money for the other two, ""reasonably priced"" as a 4-disc set or not.  Alien was made and marketed as a traditional horror flick, just set in space ""where no one can hear you scream"".  Aliens was a full-on sci-fi blowout, great gadgets/ships/sets put to work in support of the Space Marines vs. Aliens battle finale.
Alien 3 was an attempt to return to the ""unseen horror"" mode of the first movie that failed horribly; the fact that most of the movie's conflict is that faced internally by the misogynist prisoners needing Ripley's help might have amused Sigourney, but it bored the pants off the rest of us.  That's why, despite swearing in the press that this was the last Alien movie & bending over backwards to kill off the Ripley character with finality, they had to make Alien Resurrection, and stuffed it full of other characters & wrested script control from Sigourney!",1023148800,,1359,4.55327868852459

Nice acting, the ""mistery"" creature, which keeps not fully revealed until near the end of the movie, even after the movie end, there is some mystery around the aspect of the creature; and excellent Extra Features of the DVD, trailers, artwork, interviews, etc.
Aliens, also, one of the best Alien movies, a little advanced for its time, I believe its one of the best sci-fi sequels of all time! The Alien is back, and now with the rest of the batch, including the huge Alien Queen nesting in a human Colony. This DVD also has very good extra features, including a great interview with James Cameron.
So, If they are so good, why not five stars? Keep reading...
Alien 3, a regular movie, when I saw it the first time in the movies, I thought it was a real dissapointment, you have to be a real alien-fan to find its value, which I still believe its very poor; hey! If someone would have made this movie with another name and another creature, it could be a stand-alone film. I think this one does not contribute to the whole story as any of the other 3 movies do! Its contribution is very poor, and there are some details that does not match: you never find out when the alien queen puts that egg in the capsule, and you never find out where the acid which breaks the capsule (and killing Newt) comes from!, the extra features [are bad]! it only have the trailers of all movies.
Finally, Alien Resurrection, is more an action movie than a suspense/horror movie, the acting is very good, the SFX and the story rocks, again we have some aliens, a queen and a new-born creature on the loose! But, to the shame of the rest of the story, the original Alien bloodline is altered by the human hand during the cloning of Ellen Ripley, and they even leave a door open for a fifth Alien movie! The biggest lack of this DVD is again the extra features, it just have the trailers (again) and a featurette which returns a little respect to extra features.

1222743,5,B00000ILE9,"I just got this compilation about a month ago.  I'm a big fan of the Alien series.  ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" are by far the best in the series; they should have stopped there.  This still doesn't answer the question, ""Did the nuclear blast produced by the explosion of the terra-forming station on LV-426 ALSO destroy the derelict, alien spacecraft with the thousands of eggs?""
Interesting question.  I'm sure we'll see a fifth movie soon",1014768000,,434,4.824324324324325

The first 3 DVDs have a goldmine of extra features (ALIEN3 has a nice little documentary on the making of all 3 films) and are all great films, besides Resurrection. That movie was terrible. I think you just need to release the ALIEN Trilogy, because the first 3 were by far the best (especially ALIEN3).Alien Resurrection has barely any extra features and has a really lame story. But it is still good to have because it completes the series. Overall, this set is a great deal.",1014508800,,515,4.548387096774194
1222745,5,B00000ILE9,"Like that last reviewer in Jan. '00, I can attest for the unbelievable amount, or maybe shall I say, the usefulness of the extras.  Actually more specifically, the art and production photo selections.  Yes, you heard me right.  The ALIEN and ALIENS art and production sections are extremely well done with text descriptions just prior to what the following stills will be.  Offering greater insight to how the first two films were ""dreamed up"" and inspired.  The first film, ALIEN actually used artwork and ideas from FOUR artists of which one, of course, is H.R. Giger.  The ALIENS disc had a good selection of behind the scenes shorts as well that detailed some of the sets and creatures.
Now as for the ALIEN 3 disc, it has a decent little ""Half-Hour"" documentary on the first 3 films and how they have changed throughout the series, plus a latter emphasis on the workings and making of of the ALIEN 3 film itself.  This docu. had little interview segments from many actors through the series including Bill Paxton, Victoria Cartright (the other lady in ALIEN), and Tom Skeritt.  The ALIENS disc also had a interview with James Cameron that was interesting as well.
As for picture quality, ALIEN has never looked better.  Almost all scenes were crystal clear.  The ALIENS picture quality, even though labeled as 'transfered from a Hi-Def. tape, had a few grainy scenes, especially the extra scene where Ripley was sitting on a bench in the space station waiting for Burke to brief her on her now deceased 66-year old child.
Now I haven't had the chance to watch ALIEN 3 or RESURRECTION yet, but I'd assume, since they are relatively new films, that the picture quality is excellent.  Man, it's hard to believe that we're now at the 10th Anniversary of ALIEN 3.  And by going by the year displacement between each film, I'd say that we may be seeing another ALIEN movie sometime soon.  (It's been 4.5 years since RESURRECTION already.)  Some say that it might be an ALIEN vs PREDATOR incarnation.
But anyway, without a dedicated Surround Sound system, I can't really comment on the sound.  But I'd say it's pretty good.  Probably a bit lacking in the earlier two films, but that is to be expected of such older films.
But for the films themselves.  Many people criticize ALIEN 3 for being a bit cheesey, and I tend to agree with some, however, I think where the script writers failed was that they killed off Cpl. Hicks and Newt before it started.  I believe that if they would have allowed Hicks to survive, the story of ALIEN 3 would probably have been received a little better in that it wouldn't have created such a conflict between Ripley and the Double-Y boys on the prison planet.
Now the same goes for RESURRECTION.  I don't know why this film gets trashed constantly.  Is it because of the whole cloning thing being too sci-fi?  Or what?  Because as we all should know now that cloning is very much a real thing.  Or is it that is tries to be too humorous at times or the <gasp> fish-like ability of the Aliens?  I don't know about you, but RESURRECTION was probably my favorite out of all of them along with ALIENS as well.  Why?  I enjoyed the visuals in it.  The extravagant sets, the new twist on the space smugglers ala the Marines in ALIENS.  I don't know, but I tend to enjoy a fight with at least fair chances on both sides.  I mean when one creature can kill everybody within the establishment and it never gets hurt, I mean com'on, as in ALIEN and ALIEN 3.
But anyway, if you want to add the ALIEN LEGACY to your DVD collection, this is the only way to buy it.  Buy'em separately and expect to pay almost double the price.
Thanks for your time.",1013558400,,3665,4.551145038167939
1222746,4,B00000ILE9,"Alien (1979)- Directed by Ridley Scott.  (Out of ****) ***
Alien  was the film that began the now world famous Alien series, and it's a good start, but it is also somewhat boring in many areas.  The beggining half is much to slow and hasn't got any momentum until the alien shows up (I fell asleep the first time when watching the film).  Also, the characters are paper-thin.  Sigourney Weaver does her best, but in my opinion, she was far better in all three sequels.  However, this movie is still very good.  It's got suspense the first time around and it's got good atmosphere (a slasher movie in space), as well as good direction.  The sets are impressive and the effects are still great.  It's a definate must-see, but I don't suggest to many repeated viewings.
Aliens (1986)- Directed by James Cameron  (out of ****) ****
This very different sequel is almost the complete opposite of the first one.  Repeated veiwings never wear out this movie, it's so entertaining.  It's action packed, thrill packed, chill packed, and it's chock full of wonderful performances.  Sigourney Weaver makes a definate comeback over her rather boring character in the first film, and turns her into a three-dimensional human in this entry.  Also, the supporting roles are all fantastic.  Bill Paxton's funny.  Michael Biehn (The Terminator, The Abyss) is also fantastic.  Carrie Henn, in her only movie role, is also fantastic.  As you propably realized, I think this movie is a classic.
Alien 3 (1992)- Directed by David Fincher (Out of ****) ***1/2
Alien 3 is, in my opinion, very underrated.  It hasn't yet been fully recognized for it's craftsmanship and it's fantastic story. This one is noticeably a lot darker than the other entries and goes more towards the emotional side of Ellen Ripley, and once again, Sigourney Weaver is fantastic.  Also, the ending is touching and quite sad.  The movie is a masterpiece that hasn't been recognized.  Must see.
Alien Resurrection (1997)- Directed by Jean Pierre Jeunet (Out of ****) **1/2
This fourth Alien entry is quite a mixed bag.  It's obvious from the very beggining that this movie was being made for money, and not because the makers had a great story in mind.  I think the story of Ripley and the aliens should have ended with Alien 3, as it was meant to be the final one.  This movie slightley destroys the other ones, and certainly isn't as good as those ones.  However, there are good points about the movie.  An action sequence underwater is particularly memorable, as is a scene of the smugglers fighting off a bunch of bad guys, and the Ripley clone setting fire to a laboratory in which she finds attempts to clone her gone bad.  But also, this movie has bad scenes in it, as well.  Some of the dialouge is purely ridiculous.  the aliens are now done using CGI, and they don't look nearly as good as they did in the earlier ones.  Also, the acting in this movie is rock-bottom.  I mean, Winona Ryder and Sigourney Weaver are good, but the rest of the cast is pitiful, with overacting galore!  I say if you must skip one of the Alien movies, this is the one to choose, although it really isn't to horrible.
Now to my critiques of the Alien Legacy, a Collector's Edition box-set on VHS and DVD.  The set is quite nice, with a fancy box of a silver alien and all four movies fitted nicely inside, as well as featuring some good features (mainly on the first two movies) and nice collector's booklets, but there are a lot of problems, as well.  First off, the DVD set doesn't include the 60 minute documentary, The Alien Legacy, which is featured in the VHS box set (I hear it's a great documentary, but I'm not buying a whole other set just to have it) and that makes me angry.  Also, the Director's Cut of Aliens, although actually a better movie, deserved to be accompanied by The Theatrical Cut using the Branching thing. But the movie is only available in it's Director's Cut.  Next, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are actually lacking in extras.  Alien 3 has a 23 minute documentary about the series, and Alien Resurrection only has a three minute documentary that isn't in any way informative ( nothing can be informative in three minutes).
But, of course, the set is still quite good.  The picture on every film is astounding and the sound is astonishing.  All the films are framed at 2:35:1, with the exception being Aliens, framed at 1:35:1, and all the films look great.  Aliens appears a little grainy in spots but it's not a brand new movie, so it's almost perfect.  The 5.1 surround track on each movie is really booming.  And, while Part's 3 and 4 lack in extras, Part's 1 and 2 have a bunch.  First up is a dissipointing audio commentary by director Ridley Scott on the Alien DVD.  Scott pauses for long amounts of time in-between sentences and always seems like he's struggling to find out what to talk about.  Sometimes he gives out interesting and insightful information, but for the most part I found the commentary a bore. After this, you'll fin a good 18 minutes worth of deleted scenes in the extras section, some awful, and some great things that should never have hit the cutting room floor (the cocoon sequence and the fight between Ripley and Lambert both come to mind).  Also, we've got trailers (they're really spooky) and TV Spots, as well as two outtakes, one where we see the alien in full veiw behind Lambert, and one where Kane wakes up from hypersleep and starts making breakfast.
On the Aliens disk, we've got a nice (but breif) and informative interview with James Cameron that was made in 1986, as well as some bits about the creation of the Alien Queen and all sorts of other cool stuff that the fans should want to check out.  The DVD also has the Director's Cut of the movie, which actually is better, enhancing character developement and even giving us more action.  Some of the new scenes include seeing the colony on LV-426 before it was attacked, Ripley learning that her long hypersleep has made her daughter grow old and die (a touching scene) as well as a scene with a bunch of sentry guns shooting up a bunch of aliens (it's really cool, though not really neccesary).  The scenes blend in seamlessly and look just as great as the rest of the movie.  The disk also features the theatrical trailers for all four movies.
This Alien set is quite good, and it's nice owning all of them in this fine picture and audio...",1013472000,,6408,4.61660777385159
1222747,5,B00000ILE9,"The Alien Legacy is a good set including all of the Alien films. One of the obvious and major benefits is, you will save a few buck's by ordering it. Even though Alien 3 isn't exactly my idea of anything worth watching, and Resurrection seeming only to be existing because someone managed to create something out of nothing, it is still worth every cent. All of the disk's have slick features and down right cool menu's. (Alien's has the most inventive menu.) Join Ripley in all of her adventures. One thing you may notice; even though Ripley sleep's for centuries it seems she never gets a moment's rest.
Each movie is made to link one story to the other, so if you have several hours to burn, you will get an easy kick in watching all four of the Alien film's in order. As long as you have a little brain power, and a lot of stomach, you should be fine.

1222752,4,B00000ILE9,"I've bought the whole series a few days ago...  even if I have seen each movie at least five team, each.  I've watched Alien and Aliens more than thirty times each!  I've had nightmares, lol!  So why am I not giving 5 stars?  Perhaps just because I'm angry at each one of the producers after Ridley Scott.  They were having a masterpiece in their hand and they played with it a little bit too much.  In particular, in Aliens (the second one), there are so many script errors, it's a shame!  James Cameroun deceived me with this one, even if I've liked the movie.  Jerry Goldsmith really took his role of doing a soundtrack for a movie without showing any profesionalism.  He can do much better things than what he did with Aliens.  (Just look at what Hans Zimmer did for the Soundtrack of Gladiator, that's some pretty good stuff!)  No track is impressive with ALiens II.  He even missed at trying to make a military drum sounds like a military drum when they prepare the shutle.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a very ordinary film with Alien: Resurection.  Again, the soundtrack is not impressive at all.  The script is as deep as the script of Scary Movie is.  Finally, there was Alien3...  This is the one I've appreciated the most, along with the first of the series.  The first Alien was really a masterpiece.  And I think it's still the best sci-fi-thriller movie ever done.  Of course, there are many stupid things here again (I doubt that it will someday be possible to smoke aboard a spacecraft, really...  suppose Imperial Tobacco paid the producers to have the crew members to smoke?  something like that...)  The third Alien is my best because of the challenge it represents: making a film with no hero, no weapon, a film so dark you can't attach to anyone.  The soundtrack is very scary, if you like that kind of music.  (Agnus Dei is just chilling!)It's impossible to be darker than that.
I've heard Fox has reserved the domain names (...)So a fifth is coming in...  I just hope that they will do one that is as good as the best one.  (The first one...)
My heart would like to give a 5 for this package.  My head thinks it's only worth 4, because of the weaknesses noted in the soundtracks (1, 2, 4...  do something well or don't do it at all) and all the continuity errors.  (Fiorina 161 in Alien 3 becomes Fiorina 16 in Alien 4, and so on...)  Still, I can't wait to see Alien 5 now...  Happy viewing!",1005004800,2,2410,4.454128440366972

1222756,5,B00000ILE9,"What can I say? Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and Alien: Resurrection. How can you resist?
Alien: Alien [in my opinion] is the best of them all. I know many think it is Aliens that takes the cake, but I find Alien the scariest. It has the original scenes where you don't know that Kane's chest is going to burst and when Ripley is alone with the Alien. These scenes are too classic. It also has the best plot and the best ending. This is the greatest sci-fi movie of all time.
Aliens: This movie is more action-oriented than horror, like Alien. But that does not make it a bad movie at all. Far from it in fact, as I think Aliens is awesome. It has guns, lots of aliens, and a great plot. I only wish the ending hadn't been ripped off from Alien. But still, this and Alien warrant a buy.
Alien 3: Alien 3 is a great movie. Many would disagree with me. But trust me, it is. It is a perfect end to the Alien Series. The mistake reviewers made is comparing it to Alien and Aliens. No, it isn't as good as those, but it still is a great movie.
Alien: Resurrection: Unfortunately, Hollywood wants more money. Instead of leaving the trilogy at 3, like they should have, they had to make a fourth movie. Alien: Resurrection is a joke. It is just awful. I cannot find anything good to say about it. All the producers did was turn up the gore and erase any type of plot.
Well, I hope this was helpful to you. Buy this if you love sci-fi, and if you don't I would just buy Alien and Aliens.

- And to whoever said ""Movie Is Missing Scenes"" I would like you to inform that he is wrong. The movie Alien has all the scenes. But no, he didn't make up those scenes he lists.

This version was only showed once commercially in England, but it did feature all the scenes that guy says are missing. The DVD version of Alien comes with these scenes in the Feature menu.

1222759,5,B00000ILE9,"This is a collection of one of the finest horror/sci-fi/alien(!) films on this planet :-) and because they are all done from different directors, you will find an interesting mix of dealing with generally the same subject - very powerful, very brutal and very scary looking aliens.
While the first two movies deliver a lot of action, which is both intelligent and very, very scary, you have to look at the following 2 films separately.
Alien 3 is a very intelligent movie, where obviously a lot of thinking has been done before doing it. After you have watched the first to parts of this astonishing legacy, you will be totally surprised by the way the 3rd part tells the beckoning story of Ltd. Ellen Ripley. The way the camera moves is the first thing that will strike you as totally different (or alien) to the first parts. In the final scenes of the movie, the camera goes up and down, racing down semi-dark tunnels, whirling, spinning ... you almost hear it breathing hard, because it is running so fast, almost feel the lungs pumping, making your tv's screen vibrate - well maybe the camera'd have to be organic to show these symptoms of exhaustion, but YOU will definitely feel it. The camera / YOU is / ARE CHASING an ALIEN anbd you're right on to it. The movie is very fast-paced, very sinister, and very rich of new ideas. Although I liked the first two films more, I still enjoy watching Aliens 3. To be honest, when I watched it for the first time, I did not like it at all and rated it below the three other Alien films, but THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY NEEDS A SECOND VIEWING (in any case, whether you like or dislike it; the 2nd v'ing probably is not that much of a problem if you already liked it when watching it for the 1st time!). Anyway, after having seen it on dvd, at home, totally relaxed, and absolutely happy about having purchased this dvd set ...witty, well-paced, fresh, and just very thrilling.
Alien Resurrection maybe is the weakest of the whole series, but that does not mean it is a bad movie - only compared to the other 3 it is just not as good, but hey, for the 3rd sequel this an achievement to be pretty proud of (not many sequels, if there are any except these movies, manage to deliver a good follow-up to the original story while remaining good movies). As a stand alone film - which it certainley is, like all the other Alien flicks - I'd give it a 4 minus (but only a very small minus - and after all, a minus, if you look at its optics, is just a plus missing a vertical minus!). With Alien Resurrection, I love the film's idea: Ripley has been cloned, there is an Alien queen again, the US gov is secretly growing Aliens - hehe, cool! ....
In the first to movies E. Ripley is more like an innocent victim of a sudden alien invasion with a strong (and successful) survival instinct, while in A 3 and 4 she is a very tough soldier, stern, ruthless, and very dangerous.
Especially in Alien Resurrection Ltd. Ripley's appearance shows a terrifying change: Ripley is, because she has been cloned with an Alien inside her, half human, half Alien! That's just a thought that makes a very cool movie. Chilling is no term to describe Ripley's characteristics in this movie. I plea for ICY!
Now imagine, 4 cool films, on dvd (!), right - that means high screen resolution after a terrific picture enhancement, superior sound quality - life's a piece of sweet chocolate cake!
The only thing you could get grumpy about is the very modest addition of special features. To be honest, extras are pretty poor. Even the Special Ed of ""Aliens"" (the 2nd part) does not contain extras worth to earn a dvd the name ""Special Edition""! But there is something else too, this box-set misses: the fifth dvd! .... I am sorry, but there are too releases of this box set, but only one available in the U.S. That's the Region 1 4-disc edition, while in Europe, where I come from, there is quite an other release: the Region 2 5-disc release, the fifth disc containing almost two hours (if I remember correctly - I watched it some time ago) of interviews and behind-the-scenes. ....",997660800,3,4089,4.489932885906041

The crew of the Nostromo were in for it at the point where the alien made it's chest-bursting debut!  The sequel had Ripley returning to the planet to kick some alien butt!  It should have stopped at that.  But noo...  Leave it to some foreign director to take over and you see the results.  I rated this as 4 stars only for the quality of the first two films.

Yes, indeed each went about in a different way, but they all pulled it off in some aspect that can never leave a fan saying ""I was disappointed with that film"" In the 1st, there's storytelling going on and you face the terrible facts right along with the characters which made it so suspenseful. In the second, they keep your heart pounding with great action scenes, and show some interaction between characters such as Ripley and Hicks. I also had to admit its music was interesting. That credit music in the end at first makes you think that they're all safely returning home, then it sounds so creepy as if it foretells bad things to come. I liked that. In the third, they confront gripping new approaches such as going against the alien without any modern weapons, but also with feelings that make you think Ripley was never really ever safe from all her horrors as she has to face them in a whole new way. In the fourth, the new twist of how Ripley changes your thinking about her fighting these things to her actually changing them makes for a unique but touchy ending. At first you may feel like there's something you miss in the ending, but really in my opinion if all the directors could go about their own styles and yet create consistency from with the same terror that the first few scenes strike into your heart to nearly the very last, that makes this one of the best suspensefull horror series ever made.",996105600,,1552,4.43006993006993
1222762,5,B00000ILE9,"By far one of the best movie series ever made, every movie, in it's own way is breath-taking. In the first movie you have a basic introduction to the alien in a very good setting. A ship that is heading back to earth in space and the alien is stalking the crew-members and killing them off.
In number 2, unlike one you take on the alien(s) on their home turf as it were. As far as action goes, this is the best movie for action and special effects.
According to many people, alien 3 was terrible, however if you look at it from a philosophical aspect, it is a great movie. It screams, this is what it is like to do battle with one of these creatures in hell, with no weapons and no true way to fight them.
The last one is just a special-effects feast, with an ending that is interesting. I personally enjoyed it, but I have my own reservations about the end.

1222765,5,B00000ILE9,"This is an outstanding collection.  If your a science fiction fan then you must get this collection, PERIOD!!  Any DVD collection would not be complete without it.  Of course some of the films are stronger than others.  But as a whole, please show any sequel movies as strong as these.  For that matter show me and four movies based on the same story and theme which have held up as stong as these four.
Not only are these films classics, but there arguably the best Science Fiction films ever made. The only other Sci-Fi films which reach this calibur are 'Empire Strikes Back', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', '2001', 'and maybe Dark Star'.
Well may dark star can be excluded from this list, but there is no arguing it's the best cult Sci-Fi film ever made.  John Carpenter and all of the other people involved with 'Dark Star' went on to contribute to these great epic science fiction films which I've listed above.  If you get a chance, I would highly recomend watching 'Dark Star' just for the sake of the ideas and what it might have been with a better budget and a little cleaned up.  I would think this would be the ultimate remake if done properly with a better script, changed and add some elements to the plot, and with a grand budget.  There are some awesome ideas put into this Lo-Sci-Fi thriller.  Plus you'll get a few kicks out of it.  This was John Carpenter's first film and of course we know where he went from here.
I must add that Alien 3 is one of the most underated films ever made.  I think this holds up just as well, or even stronger in  certains ways than the first two.  I love the way David Fincher Directs.  From here he went on to make Fight Club, Seven, ECT... From this stand point you should watch it now with a sense of how David Fincher makes his films.  Dark, Doomed, and untimatelly down right depressing.  I think its a great film which was done wonderfully.  If anything else respect it for its artistic quality.  You might not like the plot, you might not like the characters, but there is no denying its a film which holds up as strongs as the first two.  The only thing this film doesnt have is the massess backing it because it wasn't what they expected, or not what they wanted in the next film.",982108800,2,2246,4.379227053140097

If you buy the first two separately, you'll be glad you did because you'll save yourself about 50 bucks by avoiding the boxed set.  The first two have plenty of extras to keep you busy for awhile.  The last two have a little while to develop a stronger reputation to put out more extras for those projects.  I do also need to warn that when this boxed set went on sale the first time it was literally a fraction of the cost that it is now.  Don't waste your money.

1222769,4,B00000ILE9,"The Alien Legacy boxed set is a very nicely packaged DVD collection. While the quality of the films is inconsistent, this set is not to be missed. All the missing scenes (many of which greatly improve the films rather than detract from them) are replaced in these versions. The menus, sound quality and other features are also top-notch.
While the first two films are by far the best, it's nice to get the whole set and therefore the whole story. Alien 3 is the weakest of the set, abysmal and dark without any shred of hope to it. Aliens is still the strongest film in my opinion with great action, characters and story. The first film still captures that sense of horror and fear better than any other in the series, however. Alien Resurrection is better than most of the critics rated it in my opinion, but it's really a distant third in overall quality.
The Aliens universe is a dark, unsympathetic shell in which corporate behemoths hold sway over the masses and human life holds little value. In this dismal setting, the heroism of the series main characters, Ellen Ripley above all, is all the more moving when you consider the odds stacked against them.
The Aliens series is great and influential science fiction, a precursor to Bladerunner, taking the shining chrome and bright lasers out of the genre and replacing them with dank, greasy and cramped starship hulls and flamethrowers. It's influences are still felt in today's science fiction films.",972172800,25,1458,4.7896825396825395

1222771,3,B00000ILE9,"I couldn't help but feel a little bit cheated when I got hold of this set. Starting of with the first film:Alien. The start menu is great and uses the DVD's capacity to full extend. It's the oldest movie of 'em all but it has the most extra features and hidden menu's. It's absolutely packed to the brim with extra's,and the picture quality is astounding and you can make out all the detail you couldn't quite see on video. Going through all the extra's on this DVD might take you an entire evening! Top notch!
Then comes Aliens. Same story here. Fantastic start menu. Selecting the options really makes you feel like you're a part of the movie. Tons of extra's on this disc too,giving you a good insight on how much director James Cameron really influenced the overall artistic look of all the things used and worn in the film,like for example the loader wich Ripley used to battle the Alien queen. The extra's on this DVD are once again really satisfying and you'll have a great evening diggin' through it.
So then,why not give it a five star rating then? Well because of the next two DVD's:Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection (and my final word). Alien 3 features a 23-minute making of... that doesn't show much about the making of this movie. Instead,it's focus lies on the actors' visions on the alien saga as a whole. The menu is very disappointing after you've witnessed the brilliant menu's of the previous two movies. Furthermore,it has some theatrical trailers and that's basically it. The picture quality and the sound however is of the best quality you'll ever get out of the Alien 3 movie. I would have expected more extra's on this DVD if only for the fact that it's about twelve years younger than the first Alien movie. Certainly,keeping track of a movie's progress was as much of a standard issue in the nineties as it is now?
Wich takes us to the final instalment of this box set:Alien resurrection. The DVD version of resurrection makes the Alien 3 DVD seem like it's packed full of features. There's only a ... 3-minute featurette on this DVD.I'd agree with you if you'd say that there just isn't a lot to tell about this movie. It could have been that they didn't keep track of the production process,but they did. You see,I've counted 144 pages in this ""The making of Alien resurrection"" book that I purchased a couple of years ago,so I really expected them to put the ""filmed"" version of that book on DVD but I guess it wasn't worth the trouble anyway. This DVD is nothing more than a upgraded VHS tape offering nothing more than a better sound and picture quality.
So what choice do you make? If you're an Alien fan the choice is easy:simply buy it because it's the Alien series in the best possible picture and audio quality .If you only really liked the first two Alien movies,like a lot of people only do,you'd be better off buying these discs separately. Finally,and that's the reason why I felt cheated,if you live in Europe you'll want to buy the region 2 version of this box set because that version has a bonus FIFTH disc that is NOT included in the region 1 set.",966556800,6,3090,4.549371633752244

Alien and Aliens are true classics,Alien3(despite the  frequent bashing it has received) is a great addition to the  series,Ripley(Weaver)having a more dominant role in this film than the  alien and Resurrection which even though lacks the scares of the first and  the power surge of the second is still a HIGHLY entertaining movie. One of  the most important elements of the Alien Legacy is that each movie was  directed by a different(and new at the time) director by choice of the  studios. So each movie has something special to offer while still working on  the same concept. All in all,a must buy box-set.",965865600,5,822,4.75886524822695
1222773,5,B00000ILE9,"Alien Legacy sets the standard which all other DVD titles should seek to emulate. A wonderful package of four great films plus a fifth one hour bonus disc (at least for UK editions) which tells of the sory behind the  making of the first film.
If there was a slight complaint it would be  that the extras on the discs grow smaller with each film. 'Alien' is chock  fall of stuff, 'Aliens' has less, 'Alien 3' less still and 'Alien  Resurrection' barely anything at all. Still, to be fair, you're spoiled by  all the extras on the first film and it's fair to point out that the extras  on the last movie are in line with what you tend to get on many other DVD  titles.
As for the films themselves.... well, I'd personally rate them in  the order they appeared on screen;-
Alien is a wonderful study of terror  and its impact when first released in the cinema is now the stuff of  legend. I can remember seeing it myself on the night it opened in the UK  and the reaction of the audience was unforgettable!
Aliens was a worthy  successor to Alien but it didn't quite eclipse it. The action was good and  I enjoyed the realisation from the space marines that they were in way over  their heads (slight complaint here.... would a corporation really only send  TEN lightly armed space marines to try and capture a beast of such ferocity  that may have wiped out an entire colony as well as the crew of the  Nostromo?) but it didn't have the style or feel of the first movie.  Nevertheless, still an awesome movie in its own right.
Alien 3 was slated  by many on its release but, like Blade Runner, time has been kind to it.  Once you actually sit and study the film properly it offers much more than  you first thought. For the people trapped on the planet there is little or  no hope of salvation and the suspense plays well.
As for Alien  Resurrection, well, it's not the worst sci-fi movie you'll ever see (not by  a long way) but as a member of the Alien family it is stand-out black  sheep. It tries to be all things to all people and falls short on many  counts. I enjoy to watch it now and again but am always aware of its  shortcomings.
All in all, I believe that Alien Legacy offers the best  value for money available on the DVD format at the moment. If you're a fan  of the Alien films or just somebody who enjoys watching great movies then  this set is for you... just be sure to watch them in the right order! :-)",964828800,4,2421,4.2687224669603525
1222774,4,B00000ILE9,"Despite the obvious impact Star Wars has had on nearly every science fiction film since 1977, the Alien series has managed to stand on its own, with its own imitators.
Often imitated, never duplicated, the original  Alien remains the best. But if you're a fan of the series to even the  slightest degree, then this set is a must-have. Aliens has been expanded  with previously-deleted scenes, and the entire feel of the movie is  improved. Originally screened as an action/thriller shoot-em-up, the movie  becomes throught provoking after merely ten or so minutes of additional  footage. It's amazing how much character development ten minutes can give  you!
Alien3, though often overlooked, is also an intriguing film. The  action gets underplayed here, but a cat-and-mouse sense of impending doom  pervades in its place. This one has a grittier, more thoughtful feel,  bringing back the aura of the first film.
Alien Resurrection tries to  play the middle ground. Action, tension, character development -- some  might argue this film conflicts with its own goals too much. Personally, I  think it holds up quite well in the series. I had the first three on VHS, I  have no regrets getting all four on DVD.",963532800,2,1207,5.0
1222775,4,B00000ILE9,"This is definitely one of the better box sets available.  Not that it's appearance has anything to do with it's content, but it must be pointed out that this set is pretty well put together.  The silver embossed alien and  logo on the case is pretty creepy.  As a set these films couldn't  be more different in style and tone.  From the methodic, slow build of  Scott's direction in the first film, to the high budget James Cameron  extravaganza in Aliens.  The third and fourth adopt a post apocalyptic,  prison feel under Jeunet and a human genetic, philosophical, platform with  Fincher, but are not nearly as clever or creepy as the first two films.
  As a whole this set is a lot of fun.  Geiger's creature is ugly, mean,  and truly scary.  I remember the first time I saw Alien when I was a kid (I  have just dated myself) and it was the only movie then and since that truly  scared me.  Freddy, Jason, Michael Meyers did nothing for me, but the first  Alien movie freaked me out.  It still scares me today.  Given that fact,  this movie and set are essential for my collection out of respect for  making me lose sleep; I would wager the same for any sci-fi fan.
  The  menu features of the set are well put together.  In the case of the first  and second disks the menu itself is worth playing with, just to watch the  camera navigate itself through the ship.  Similar to the films, however,  the third and fourth film menu presentations lose something.  Not as much  time is taken in the actual construction and they, still acceptable, pale  when compared to the their predecessors.  I bought this set without  having seen the last two films, but I am such the sci-fi fan I knew just  following the story from the first two films would be worth the watch.  I  am very glad I did, but am now nervous that the fifth film is being  considered for shooting.  Rumor has it the alien finds its way to earth....  could be fun.",959731200,4,1927,4.385714285714286
1222776,4,B00000ILE9,"I will start off this review by talking about the movies themselves...
ALIEN: For me, 'Alien' is the best movie of the lot.  The atmosphere created by this movie is incredible and the original is by far  the most tense and scary Alien movie of them all!  The real reason this  movie is superior to the others in my opinion is because of the outstanding  set pieces and the ground breaking models used for the spaceship shots etc.  Also, the characters in this movie are great and you really feel as though  they start off hating each other but are slowly forced to work as a  team.
ALIENS: This follow up to 'Alien' is much more action orientated  then the original but still manages to be fairly scary.  The characters in  this movie are unforgettable, as is the dialog.  The action in this movie  comes thick and fast and works Extremely well thanks to the fabulous  direction from James Cameron.  However, I can't help but feel that this  sequel lost some of the charm the original.  Never the less, this is a  classic movie and is not to be missed by anyone.
Alien 3: This movie was  badly recieved by critics and the general public when in was released (i'm  afraid this included myself).  However, 'Alien 3' is yet another classic  movie and deserves to carry the Alien title.  This second sequel captures  the atmosphere of the original film by not letting us see too much of the  alien creature itself.  The sets and general feel of the movie seem to be  rather gothic and I felt this suited the movie very well.  The film is  suitably scary although it lacks the tension created by the first two  because the creature is so familiar now.
Alien Resurrection: Hmm, oh  dear!  After such a good track record the Alien series slips up.  The main  problem with this movie is that all the characters are totally unbelievable  and there is no fear in it at all!  The aliens have been created using CGI  for the most part and as a result we see way too much of them which is a  huge mistake because the previous films were scary because we only saw  parts of the creature.  It upsets me when I look at the first film and then  watch this!  Overall, one to avoid!
THE EXTRAS:  Alien:  Wonderful! Not  only to we get behind the scenes fottage and deleted scenes but also  feature length commentary from director Ridley Scott as well as a whole  host of other extras such as outtakes and concept art.
Aliens: There are  some top extras such as conept art and an interview with director James  Cameron but sadly there is no commentary (a real missed opportunity).  However, this is the special edition of 'Aliens' and as such contains 17  minutes of restored footage.  Some people claim that the new footage is a  waste of time but I disagree and feel it adds greatly to the movie (e.g. we  find out that Ripleys daughter is dead so the emotional impact between her  and Newt is much stronger).
Alien 3: A short featurette  and trailor!  What a disappointment.
Alien Resurrection:  Again, nothing more than a  short featurette and the original trailor.  This is less of a  disappointment because I really don't care for this film much any way!
Alien Legacy:  A bonus 5th disk that looks in depth at the making of the  original Alien movie.  This is fantastic as it offers real  insight!
Conclusion: This DVD box set feels a little rushed!  It's as if  Fox finished working on the Alien DVD and almost completed the Aliens DVD  and the relised they had met their deadline so quickly put some cheap  rubbish on the Alien 3 and Resurrection DVDs and released them!  However,  the Alien movies are absolute classics (with the exception of  'Resurrection') and as such this DVD box set comes highly recommended.",959040000,5,3703,4.528158295281583

Yes,  yes, and yes. Simply put, this is the best usage of DVD to date. Picture  quality and sound are outstanding, and that's just the beginning.

1222784,3,B00000ILE9,"As described in most of the other reviews, the first 2 movies (""Alien"", ""Aliens"") are definitely the best. ""Alien"" introduces us to a space freighter crew pulled out of  hypersleep to investigate the source of a distress beacon. We meet the  creature that awaits them on the stormy planet: a seething, relentless,  lightning-fast, and cold-blooded (acid-blooded, in truth) predator that  uses human beings as reproductive hosts, with horrific and gut-wrenching  results. ""Aliens"" covers the rescue mission, in which space  marines are dispatched to rescue a colony that landed on the stormy planet.  ""Aliens"", directed by Terminator's James Cameron, is a more  action-oriented film and, in the view of many people, even better than its  predecessor. Hard to believe but true. ""Alien 3"" covers Ripley's  crash-landing on a planet inhabited by convicts who have been given life  sentences. The Alien caused the crash and proceeds to cause all kinds of  mayhem, destruction, and the usual loss of life. People generally dislike  ""Alien 3"", primarily because most of the characters are rapists  and murderers and, hence, hard to sympathesize with. If anything, I found  myself rooting for the alien (""Just get this over with"", I  thought). This is the weak link in the collection.
In ""Alien  Resurrection"", it is several centuries after Ripley's death, except  Ripley has been brought back to life through the miracle of cloning. But  now, Ripley also has DNA from the alien incorporated into her genetic  structure. The evil corporation has genetically cloned several of the  aliens but they escape and cause mayhem, destruction, and the usual loss of  life. Ripley, part alien herself, is now rather neutral about the creature.  While ""Alien Resurrection"" shows the evolution of Ripley's  character from frightened protector to cunning survivor, it lacks the  tension of the first two movies, since we know that the alien won't kill  Ripley. Instead, the director would have us worry about characters that we  know less about and, in truth, don't really care for very much.
Ridley  Scott and James Cameron understood how frightened audiences--and the  characters--would be to think about having their bodies used as hosts. It  is horror personified. The latter 2 movies are more in the slasher  tradition, filled with gratuitous violence of people getting their heads  bashed in. Scott and Cameron steered away from overt violence--it was  enough to know what was going to happen. They borrowed a page from Greek  tragedy.

The collection easily rates a 5, however, for me the first two (Alien and Aliens) alone justify this score. Both these movies maintain a level of  suspense rarely found in other scifi/horror films. The additional scenes  included in Aliens are a pleasant bonus, although they do not add much to  the film overall
Alien3 is the weakest film of the collection. The plot  is thin relative to the others as well as being somewhat predictable. The  Alien itself is slightly disappointing. The problem director Fincher faces  is the issue of plot repitition - the same characters facing the same foe -  his response is an Alien containing the genes of a dog. The result is not  so convincing
Alien Resurrection sits more comfortably with the first two  movies. The transformation in Ripley's (Weaver) character is spellbinding  and gives the director (Jeunet) a blank canvass to work with.

Not to take away any effort from the last two, I think the first two is classic in its  own right.  I cannot say enough about Aliens (2nd part of the series)  because it contains visual effects that is stunning for its age.  Cameron  had to do a lot of homework on what works and what won't work with the  tight budget he had.  It's amazing what he did with the kind of money in  his hands, sort of like Lucas with his first Star Wars.  Besides beating  the odds with special effects, the story telling and balance is cunning.  Cameron bend and twist the plots to gain audience's respect for knowing the  material and doing his homework.  Instead of copying what Alien did.  Cameron made it better.  The 3rd in the series contained too much profanity  even for a jailhouse scenario.  The set was good but overall even with a  talented director and ambitious effort, the 3rd in the series failed to  make an impression as the first two.  To define what is a good movie, you  have to stand back and look at the overall picture.  I love the special  effects on the 4th one and I love Winonna Ryder... The irony is, being a  synthetic, Call (Winonna) shows the most humane attributes of fear,  emotional attachment and being hurt by ridicules than any of her human  buddies.  For some reason I like the 4th one more than the 3rd by a big  margin.  It's highly entertaining.  To rank them, I would #1 Aliens, #2  Alien, #3 Alien Resurrection, #4 Alien 3",943920000,,1582,4.366782006920415
1222789,4,B00000ILE9,"Each of the Alien movies are representative of the times in which they were made.  Alien had at its focus a mistrust of the giant corporation and sex as death as another primary theme.  The alien is the most sexual of all  of the characters (ironically, its ally, the robot, is the least sexual of  all of the characters).
Aliens is representative of 1980's optimism.  The  company is still evil, but this time the conclusion is upbeat.
Alien3, on  the other hand, reflects the pessimism that was going on economically in  the early '90s, displayed by Ripley's sacrifice at the end mirroring the  impression that many Generation Xr's had that they would have to pay for  the deficit that had ballooned during the 80's.
Alien Resurrection, on  the other hand, displays the attitudes of the hip, self-referential late  90's.  Things aren't too serious this time around, even as things are still  going to hell, now the characters are laughing about it.",943056000,16,950,4.819875776397516

1222795,5,B00000ILE9,"As a movie buff I just adored the ""Aliens"" movies.  I can hardly believe that Alien was released 20 years ago.  Viewing the four movies, in one sitting has slightly altered my impression of them. If anything I  appreciate them even more.  I am not sure that these are horror movies  though.  I see them as an excellent Sci-Fi series.  They merge together  very well, unlike the Star Trek movies.  What we see is a story presented  in 4 chapters.  One of  basic themes, through out, is the government agency  wanting an alien.  This ""request"" appears in Alien, and is  covered in all the movies.  The quiet beginning of Alien sets the  scene, with the explanations well done.  Then the pace picks up, slowly and  relentlessly at first.  Then you hit Aliens.  With the extra footage added,  this seems even faster than before.  It's difficult to imagine a more  forceful movie.  The pace is exhausting. Then the cooling down with Aliens  3, this movie had me on the edge of my seat, so creepy, you just knew  something was about to happen - but when?.  Alien Resurrection a good  final(?) chapter.  I felt that the boxed set was superior to the Laser disc  sets, I had only the last 3 to judge.  Is this set worth the money?  certainly, and then some.  Very well transferred, and very welcome.  I had  thought that  Fox was joining the DIVX camp, and had just about given up  hope.  So thank you to Fox, a very worthy effort and much appreciated.  One  last thought, Sigourney Weaver deserves an Oscar for this series. She is  very good in these movies, very convincing.  Other actors have been awarded  Oscars for far inferior performances.",929404800,,1639,4.560975609756097
1222796,5,B00000ILE9,"I previously had the Laserdisc versions of the first two movies.  The DVD knocks these out of the water visually and audibly.  The extras are also great.
My only criticism is that I live the UK and am therefore  ineligible for receiving the fifth disc as there is no option for mailing  to England even though I would gladly pay the extra cost.",928972800,,344,4.412698412698413
1222797,3,B00000ILE9,"I am assuming that you have seen all four Alien films, so I will skip the review on the contents of the films and focus on this special DVD edition instead.
Unlike the VHS edition, the DVD box does not come with the  behind the scenes special/making of Alien Legacy which was included in the  VHS edition.  Instead, you get a coupon which you can use (with the usual  hoops of original receipt & S&H fees to jump through) to redeem the  5th disc, which is available ""while supplies last"".
The 20th  Anniversary edtion of Alien on DVD is a very impressive disc - the deleted  scenes, including the unfilmed ones, were included in the disc, complete  with written/director commentary.  The deleted scenes demonstrate director  Ridley Scott's ability to recognize the fact that the unseen can generate  more fear than excessive gore.
The Aliens DVD was clearly the best of  the bunch.  It is basically the reissue of the Aliens Special Edition Laser  Disc box that went out of print for years, and you sure get the most bang  for the buck with this DVD, now priced at about a quarter of the LD box's  price with enhanced sound and picture from digital remastering.  The  animated menu is also very cool, clearly the most impressive of the four.  All the supplement materials from the LD box was meticulously transferred  to the DVD edition.  The only shortcoming was that the disc was incomplete  in the trailers department.  There were a lot of TV spots made for Aliens,  most of which are still available in QuickTime format downloadable from the  Web (please do not e-mail me for the URL, since I don't have it).  However,  the disc offers only 1 theatrical trailer from each of the Alien films  instead.
Alien 3, on the other hand, suffers a lack of features (with a  behind the scenes/making of that probably aired on HBO when the film was  released) and the bad DVD authoring has resulted in a ""pause"" in  the movie at approximately 58 minutes and some 20-odd seconds into the  movie, which sticks out like a sore thumb and really ruined the movie for  me.  I haven't sat through the other 3 movies yet, but I wouldn't be  surprised if the same problem exists on the other discs as well.  The fact  that Fox lets this kind of glitch slip by while charging more for their  DVDs compared to their competitors says something about their attitude to  consumers, IMHO.  I was also disappointed the legendary ""director's  cut"" featuring substantially different dialog and plot lines was not  presented with this edition.
Alien Resurrection has similar problems  with Alien 3 in the (lack of) feature department.  With a behind the  scenes/making of featurette that already aired on HBO (IIRC), there really  isn't much else to offer.  A director/cast/crew's commentary track is  sorely missing.
This special 4 disc boxset also comes with nine  collector's cards - they are about baseball trading card size and were  tucked in between the pages of the insert booklet of Alien Resurrection.  Due to the substantial mass of the 9-card package, the insert booklet  suffered deformity as a result of the unsecured pack of cards being  shuffled around during shipping.  Looks like the folks at Fox did not do  their homework.
In conclusion, if you missed out on the Aliens special  edition LD boxset, go for the Aliens DVD itself.  But if you are a diehard  Alien fan and are not picky about lack of features or technical glitches,  this is a good addition to your DVD library.  This boxset appears to be  rushed to the market in order to meet the deadline for the 20th anniversay  of Alien, because nothing new was presented with all but the first film.  Let's hope Fox fixes the pause glitches and issue a more comprehensive  edition in the near future.",928713600,26,3746,4.701238390092879

1222800,4,B00000ILE9,"Alien is, perhaps, the most sexual horror film ever made. Ridley Scott subverted the gothic formula in order to create a tale of Freudian horrors in which a space ship becomes a metaphor for female anatomy. Those that  miss the point that the alien represents female sexuality, and the  reactions to it stand in for the male response to a strong woman, should  watch the film again with fresh eyes. The other three films in the series  are fine. Especially Alien Resurection, which has an interesting subtext.  Alien3 is a good attempt, but falls flat. Aliens, the least of the series,  is watchable for Weaver's strong performance. Overall a set worth owning.",928368000,,660,4.848214285714286
1222801,5,B00000ILE9,"I am a major fan from from the uk.  I think that the Alien series of films are the best i have ever seen.  Alien is a good film with excellent special effects and the scene where the alien bursts out of the mans stomach almost  made me lose my dinner.  Aliens has to be one of the best alien films.  I  still can't believe they left out the extra footage.  You actually get to  see newts family and you get to know things about Ripley that you wouldn't  know.  Alien 3 is okay but can be a bit depressing at times, no offence to  David Fincher though, but it lacks in the same sort of rush as the first  two and stands at the bottom in terms of quality.  Alien resurection is  excellent.  Sigourney Weaver looks amazing and her half Alien character is  often funny and creepy.  The supporting cast are good and it's great to see  Wynona Ryder back.  All in all I would say Alien Resurection #1.  Aliens  #2, Alien #3,  Alien3 #4.",928281600,,929,4.159090909090909

1222803,5,B00000ILE9,"What impresses me most about 20th Century Fox's Alien series is that the studio has strongly resisted the temptation to churn out mindless brain-dead sequels until the law of diminishing returns kicks in.  The  series has, to date, provided refreshing variations on a theme in each case  directed by visionary film-makers, even if the results have sometimes been  a little flawed.  Sigourney Weaver has wisely bolted her career to this  series and has consistently offered us a dynamic and compelling portrayal  of a woman facing her personal demons,  illuminating all the films with a  level of complexity unheard of in the genre.  Most fans of the series will  not argue over my choice of Cameron's first sequel as the stand-out episode  (especially when presented, as it is here, in it's extended version), very  closely followed by Ridley Scotts cramped claustrophobic original.  That  the other two lag behind is not a reflection of the films themselves rather  than of the very the high standard set by Alien and Aliens.  Ignoring such  comparisons, they are not without interest and deserve re-appraisal.  Alien  3, especially, still seems to me a dark, moody, angst-ridden film with an  almost mythic element completely ignored by it's original audience.  Should  you purchase this set?  Well, it's a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned -  the extensive extra's and additional footage are merely the icing on a very  delicious cake.",927936000,,1439,5.094827586206897
1222804,5,B00000ILE9,"I love the Alien series, good and bad parts all together.
Alien the Horror: Best of the series (I like basic horrors) and was original. Many imitators, no successors.
Aliens the Action Movie: Guns 'n' Ammo in  outer-space. Best ships, weapons and story of the series.
Alien 3 the Art  Movie: The cute kid and the hero die before the credits are over, powerful  imagery, (loved the hint that something wasn't right with Ripley, alien  hatching, burn the bodies scene)  and a new aspect to the alien life cycle.  Many didn't get the point. This is the thinking fans movie.
Alien  Resurection the comedy: Felt sorry for the poor alien at the end, finaly a  human face to empathise with the alien, just wants his momma, and she  flushes him out the airlock again. Nice! Still weaker than the first 3  combined, but interesting anyhow.",926812800,,830,4.662068965517242
