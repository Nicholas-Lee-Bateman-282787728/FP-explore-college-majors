8626169,4,B00GPVQD9U,"I recommend this DVD for new Cowboy Shooters.  Lefty Longridge does a good job in this instructional DVD.  He covers the basics of getting started in the sport. I only wish there was more info, such as a comparison of different holster options. Explaning cross-draw for example. It would have been cool if he had a ""posse"" of beginners shooting with him for our edification.  Overall this DVD is worthwhile for beginners wishing to learn more.",1420070400,,443,4.802631578947368
