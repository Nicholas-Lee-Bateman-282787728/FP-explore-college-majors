It begins with Dusty singing Deep in the Heart of Texas. Then they hear shots, but they are on vacation. Alibi goes into town for supplies. Three riders shoot at a man driving a wagon, it crashes off the road and goes down a hill. Alibi carries this man to a cabin, he doesnt know who those three men are. This wounded man tells his name (Bret Travis) and destination. Denby introduces an imposter to Judy Wilson, co-heir to the Lazy W ranch. Alibi rides by and asks for directions, then returns to his partners and tells them of the swindle. Who can identify Bret? His papers were sent to Denby the lawyer. Dusty goes to that ranch and says he was a friend of Mr. Wilson (lately deceased). Granny questions him. Crash orders milk in a saloon, and for another customer. Sue me. Then he goes to Denbys home to search his files. He is caught, but makes a deal!

Crash will work as the foreman for the Lazy W ranch. He takes charge. Who has Bret Travis identification papers? We see where they are hidden. Crash meets a man who was asked to survey the Wilson ranch for oil. Where is this area? Crash finds it, oil is bubbling out of the ground. A man recognized the Range Busters and warns Denby! The Range Busters plan for a showdown at the Lazy W ranch. But Dusty is captured and locked in a shed. Bret Travis greets Miss Judy, but is accused of a robbery! Crash goes to Denbys office, there is a confrontation and a fight. But Crash is shot! Denby and his crooked pals go to the Wilson ranch. Granny tells Alibi where Dusty is locked up. Alibi and Dusty ride, then split up. There is a chase for action. The good guys win! Granny says goodbye. The Range Busters ride away for another adventure.

This story tells how the true heir was able to get his inheritance, a ranch that has oil. The heiress was also saved (implicitly). I suspect some scenes were edited to reduce the running time to an hour. In these films the Range Busters use their real names: Ray Crash Corrigan, John Dusty King, and Max Alibi Terhun.",1507248000,,2048,4.3700787401574805
