8332011,5,B001P449DE,This DVD originally produced at the end of WWII tells the whole story. We the People...owe a great debt to those who have given so much.,1313452800,3,136,4.269230769230769
8332012,5,B001P449DE,"Although very dated and a bit idealistic, if not overly positive, this film review of the impact of war on soldiers returning from WWII is startling for its reality. One gets a glimpse into treatment methods used during the late 1940s and early 1950s. After viewing this documentary, one may wish to read a book written a few years later, namely, ""Toward Therapeutic Care."" TW, LICSW",1283817600,13,383,4.818181818181818

8332014,5,B001P449DE,"John Huston refused to make pure propaganda.  This documentary is real. The problems and treatments of mental illness from war are very frankly discussed and the patients are real soldiers (I wonder if they could do this today?). Nobility Studios took the time and effort to revitalize a film that the government would rather have hidden, especially in light of the modern world situation.  This is a good movie and the talents of both John and Walter Huston bring an element of meaning that is simply not available in other films from this period.  A must for a collection because it is both art and reality.  My thumbs up.",1237852800,30,624,4.697247706422019
