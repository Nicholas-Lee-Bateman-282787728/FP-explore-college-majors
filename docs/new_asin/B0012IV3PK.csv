3089435,4,B0012IV3PK,"Hi Folks, I'm not a Yankee or Diamondback supporter per se...but this was a historic and terrific series so I picked it up immediately and have to report that this SET is a let down.

Unlike many of the other series sets this ONLY has the complete games from the series, which given that it was a full seven is acceptable but something more of the lead up would have been better for context.

Also..DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR 1 DISC 2001 MLB DVD...its not on this set..
the bonus feature they tout as ""Destiny In The Desert"" (2001 Official World Series Film) isn't the hour plus movie but a scant 9 Minutes!!  what kind of ""Film"" is that?  Featurette...maybe...but calling that a film is ridiculous...its about as long as the championship acceptance feature..
the bonus interviews Don't feature Schilling or Johnson?

Hey..if you are a Diamondbacks fan ...you have to have this...but its nothing compared to the 1988 Dodger set or the 1977 Yankee sets...but more on par with the 1975 REDS set...but that was understandable...I just figured they had less good material 30 years ago..there is no reason that this set couldn't have been fleshed out a bit more.

At least this tremendous series is there to enjoy...geez when you consider all the hall of famers on that field..wow..and not to forget that CLemens and Johnson are a couple of the ALL TIME strikeout kings...and Schilling will be in the Hall as well..it ended the most recent Yankee Dynasty...and came on the heels of 911...this series just deserved more in my opinion.",1209513600,19,1523,4.771863117870723
3089436,5,B0012IV3PK,I am a huge yankee fan considering ordering this because it was the greatest world series I remember watching even though we lost every game was terrific except game 6,1420502400,,167,4.6
3089437,4,B0012IV3PK,It was just what I expected! Good to relive the glory! It came in perfect condition. I wish there were more special features. And I wish the tapes were still in good condition.,1376006400,,176,4.363636363636363
3089438,5,B0012IV3PK,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching all seven games from the 2001 World Series.  I hadn't seen them since watching them live when I lived in Arizona back then.  Oh, the memories...some bad, some wonderful.",1335744000,,199,5.0
3089439,5,B0012IV3PK,"I've seen replays of the ninth inning of Game 7 a hundred times, and am still on the edge of my seat in anticipation when Gonzo steps to the plate.  Great set, fun to watch (definitely more-so if you are a Dbacks fan or a Yankee hater).  Gonzo, Gracie, Beautiful Steve Finley, David ""Dayum-he's-hot"" Delluci, Reggie, Jay, Randy, Curt and the rest ... all qualify for ""Mr. November"" status in my MLB record book.

Great gift to give with some tickets for opening day!",1333238400,,466,4.523809523809524
3089440,5,B0012IV3PK,"I went to one of the World Series games. Arizona won big time. My daughter wanted this for her birthday so this review is based on her comments to me. She has absolutely loved this collection. If you are a Diamondback's fan, you should buy it!",1324166400,,243,4.304347826086956
3089441,3,B0012IV3PK,"It is certainly all 7 games of the 2001 world series, but for my money I think they should have done better than record straight from the master tape and leave the imperfections. Extra content is okay. But for your money, you're better saving those dollars and buying the standard 1 dvd 2001 world series.",1283644800,2,305,4.5636363636363635
3089442,5,B0012IV3PK,I feel this is a great DVD for all D-Back fans to have. If you were luck enough to be at any of the games (I was at game 7) it is a must have. The only bummer is that it was broadcast in high definition.,1260144000,,203,3.4347826086956523
3089443,5,B0012IV3PK,I bought this along with the Cincinnati Reds and Boston Red Sox series as birthday presents for my son.  He is a baseball fanatic and remembers watching the Reds/Boston when he was only 12 in 1975.  He felt the D-Back/Yankee 2001 series came the closest to the excitement of that series.  He loves both and now him and his 2 sons are watching some of the great players of the past that are in the Hall of Fame along with future Hall of Fame players.  Having the DVD's of the old World Series available is wonderful in that the younger generation can watch the players in action instead of just hearing what is said or short news reel clips of them.  MLB is doing something right with the issuance of this collection.,1243987200,,716,4.393939393939394

3089445,4,B0012IV3PK,"If Richardson ""JrJ"" is right about this then maybe it shouldn't sell for $35. Maybe $15 is more reasonable. Both the History Channel and A@E Home Video sell this for just that.",1224201600,,176,4.53125
