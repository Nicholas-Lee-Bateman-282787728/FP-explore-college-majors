1661245,1,B00005TNER,"I was hoping that Mariah Carey would prove everyone wrong and make a film that actually does something for her acting career. But judging from the cheesefest that was this trailer, she's gonna stink up cinemas everywhere big-time! I mean am I really supposed to believe Mariah Carey as a poor backpacking singer! She would have been better off in a movie like The Bodyguard, somewhere she could play herself. A character film like this is far too taxing for someone who's had so little acting experience.",996019200,10,504,4.804597701149425
1661246,5,B00005TNER,"Mariah fans will dig this flick for sure--and I bet a lot of others, too. Considering she's sold over ten million per album she has released and has more sales than any female recording artist in history, I think her fans alone can fuel this film's success. Congrats, Mariah!!!!! I can't wait to see it...",995846400,7,305,4.5636363636363635

1661249,1,B00005TNER,"Don't waste your time. Don't make the same mistake I did, going in thinking this might be funny. It's not. It's just boring, and so badly made that it actually made me angry. Do yourself a favor, pick literally any other movie for riff night, and have a good time. There is no good time to be had watching Glitter.",1484179200,,314,4.25

1661258,1,B00005TNER,I watched it because of it was featured on the How Did This Get Made podcast. I knew what I was getting. I just wish I didn't pay $4 for the pleasure.,1473552000,,150,3.71875
1661259,5,B00005TNER,Timeless classic,1473033600,,16,7.5
1661260,3,B00005TNER,"When telling people I planned to watch Glitter amongst hand selected horrible movies some people actually reacted with a very hushed ""I love that movie"" (un-ironically) while looking away or down. I totally get it now. If you hate it you should, for the awful hackney music video disjointedness and needless yet inescapable slow motion. For those people whispering that they really love this movie I get that as well. This movie does have a beating heart, behind Mariah's terrifying eyebrows  & uncontrollably changing facial expressions this movie is about how genuinely insane it is to be ripped directly from hardship and delivered to a stardom no one would even think to hope for. It's about how when everything breaks the music is still there. I have no idea what the moral of the story is. DJ Dice dies but he leaves a nice note, the end leaves you scratching your head but at least she meant it. Every demented moment of it.",1467590400,,931,4.711656441717792

1661268,1,B00005TNER,"I wish that I could give this no stars. Honestly, Im the biggest Mariah Carey fan and I hate to say this BUT SHE DESERVED BETTER. Mariah is my biggest inspiration. I have a bracelet that says, What Would Mariah Do, so when I set out to watch Glitter my expectations were high. I was crushed to see what a desperate pile of garbage it was. Like did they really expect us to believe that she could eat that much glitter?! The answer is a big fat NO. The entire movie was her eating a pile of glitter. 2 hours of her scooping glitter into her gullet. It was so unrealistic. I asked my doctor and he said that GLITTER IS TOXIC. Thats right she would have DIED. A more realistic movie would have shown her dying of a glitter overdose and becoming a glitter zombie superstar. If it was really a biopic like they advertised, thats what would have happened. Frankly, Im crushed. Ive been sobbing into my Mariah Carey pillow pet for what feels like years.",1461628800,,946,4.320224719101123

1661277,4,B00005TNER,"Glitter is definitely not as bad of a film as the critics described it as. Yes, there were some moments in the film where Carey's acting was sub-par, but overall she seemed confident playing her character and did a pretty good job of portraying her as well. This film I must say is truly the victim of bad publicity and had an unfortunate release date. I would give this a chance! The soundtrack for this movie is also phenomenal, with songs like ""Lead The Way"", ""Want You"", and ""Never Too Far"". Give this film a chance, you won't be disappointed!",1451520000,7,547,4.48

1661282,1,B00005TNER,"I saw this movie when it released in the theaters and I remember that night I was in the cinema only about 5 or 6 other people were  in there with me.
I also remember that night before I went to see it I said to my self, "" My stomach won't stand to see this movie more than once."" because I heard critics say that it was bad.
After seeing this movie I felt embarrassed, disappointed, and discouraged. I remember coming home that night after seeing it my mother asked, ""How was it ?"" and I said, "" It sucked.""

 In my book Mariah Carey is a good singer, but not a good actor and could not compare her acting to Elvis Presley. In other wards Mariah is made for singing not for acting. Doing music videos is one thing but a movie is something else. I say she is better off sticking to making records.",1445904000,,797,4.063694267515924

1661300,5,B00005TNER,"A decent movie. I have the DVD, the vinyl soundtrack & CD. I think the music is better than anything Mariah Carey has done since. I worked at Blockbuster when this movie was released on DVD. I took it home and then recommended it to my customers. It did well as far as rentals went. Mariah is believable in her role. Terrence Howard is a nemesis to Mariah's DJ boyfriend in this movie. It's predictable in  some areas but considering this was Mariah's first film, she did well. Highly Recommended",1423612800,2,496,4.511111111111111

The leading lady was not named Glitter, she couldn't act, tons of lip syncing, the costumes were stupid, and I'm judging them based on all singer/dancer/follow your dreams-type of movies.  Trying to remember this movie is giving me a headache, and blood is coming out of my tear ducts.  Definitely do not recommend",1412121600,3,491,4.49438202247191

Don't really understand why MC had a nervous breakdown after this. It's really not that bad.

The story is predictable and is like an after-school special in my opinion. Relatively harmless.

She's so unusual looking and that voice is incredible. Really so unique. The story is Ghetto-Fabulous!!!",1410566400,,399,5.107692307692307

1661334,4,B00005TNER,"I really liked this movie.  It shows the dark side of the music industry. It shows how a really strong opinionated person can easily be transformed by fame.  Weaved into the story is a Milli Vanilli plot.  Its funny, compelling and makes you think about how precious life really is and how important friendship is.  There were several characters that could have been developed a lot more. I felt every part had the perfect actor.  Terrance Howard making an appearance as a bad guy was great to see. Overall I thought it was entertaining enjoyed seeing Mariah at the height of her fame playing a part that I thought was perfect for her.  Where movie lacked, great talent filled in the gaps.",1394668800,,689,4.60655737704918

1661336,5,B00005TNER,"If you don't like glitter you were probably a victim of what I call the ""media bashing"" of a superstar. People really try to act like this is the worst movie ever. It's not. I'm not saying it's the best ever but Mariah does a really good job and the storyline is compelling enough; plus hello, all the singing? Never Too Far is still one of my favorite songs and this movie still makes me shed some tears...
It took me a while to buy it but I'm so glad I finally did. Now I get to watch it whenever I feel like it!
So I would say that if you're hesitating about watching this or deciding whether to buy it, go ahead.

Once upon a time, Mariah Carey was a force to be reckoned with. One multi-platiumn hit after another, Mariah was set to take the music world by storm with her multiple orgasmic vocal chords. But somewhere along the lines, someone had the brillant idea of making her a movie star. Too bad no one thought to see if the diva could actually act. That may have saved her the trouble of checking in the psych ward for her ""breakdown"".

The story (sorry, I can't say that with a straight face) is a rags to riches story about the metoric rise of Billie Frank (Carey). But once she's there she discovers that to stay at the top may mean having to sell her soul to the Golden Calf.

Bad acting, bad writting, and a clueless director pepper this waste of celluloid. And Mariah even manages to screw up playing herself. How is that possible? Even Paris Hilton is able to be herself.

They should have just made it current day since you can't tell it was the 80's anyways.  I really liked Mariah's character, I thought she did a good job with her role.  The DJ dude was sort of interesting.  I hated Da Brats character and the mexican friend< Tia Texada?  They were both highly annoying.  As for the music, I loved it.

1661361,1,B00005TNER,"""Glitter"" deserves its reputation as a hackneyed rags-to-riches story that has been told and re-told many times. After the opening credit sequence, which surely must hold some kind of record for most pointlessly drawn out credit sequence in film history, we meet a young Mariah Carey. Here Mariah plays Billie Frank, a talented young singer who has a meteoric rise to the top, but (surprise!) finds that the high life has its own set of challenges. I was especially amused by a conversation among producers when the assertion ""He just signed Chilly D"" was taken as great praise. That made me think was it Chilly D as played by Lorenzo Lamas in ""Body Rock,"" or Chilly D that Melvin Van Peebles made famous in ""Identity Crisis?"" After watching the film, sadly it seems likely it was the former.

Billie's overprotective producer and boyfriend Dice, played by Max Beesley (who?,) provides much of the conflict in the film: please especially note his ridiculous overreaction to seeing Billie in a bikini during a video shoot. Note also that a musical montage shopping spree with the girls makes it all better: no problem, it was the same decade that Madonna sang about a material girl, after all. The film has numerous subplots including a pathos-filled story about looking for the mother that gave her up for adoption and about rival would-be music mogul Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) who has a backroom deal for her contract, which leads to fisticuffs and ultimately Dice's untimely demise. It's all very dramatic. The film, annoyingly set in the 1980's with the requisite clothes and utterly wretched music, perfectly suits Carey's talents. Perhaps the single biggest annoyance was the repetitious use of ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On,"" made famous by Robert Palmer on the 1986 album ""Riptide."" They got the rights to the song, and they got their money's worth.

This film got terrible reviews and deserved every single one of them. Mariah Carey may have a great voice (nobody's saying otherwise,) but a leading lady she is not. Combine that with a terrible script, wooden supporting performances, and subject matter that has been done much better repeatedly and the course to oblivion is clear. The DVD features two music videos, ""Never Too Far"" and the insufferable ""Loverboy"" by Carey, and a director's commentary if you can stand to sit through it a second time (though only the truly hardened bad movie viewer should even consider such a feat.) I actually watched the commentary to glean insight into the train wreck, but if you can believe it, it's even more pretentious and tortuous than the film itself.

""Glitter"" is everything you've ever heard and so much less.",1284508800,5,2674,4.924611973392461
1661362,2,B00005TNER,"After ""Glitter"" and her interviews from the ""I Love the 80s Strikes Back"" specials, I had a startling epiphany about Mariah Carey: she's a very boring woman in person.  No offense, she is a great singer (more than I would ever admit in public), but while she's an angelic Goddess that could cry out the fountain of youth on stage, as a normal being, she has all the tone and enthusiasm of a soul-crushed cubicle worker.  This film showcased many of her inabilities: her limited range when acting, her monotonous deliveries, her consistently mellow expression even when she's angry, and the way she pouts whenever she has tear drops in her eyes. She was so dull in her acting, she makes Britney Spears look like Barbara Streisand.  In all probability, she could be the primary flaw of this whole film.

No way am I going to be lenient with ""Glitter"", but I do acknowledge how this film had put Mimi in a serious state of depression.  I am going to be nice and say this movie ISN'T worth getting despaired over, as it is slightly better then the likes of ""From Justin to Kelly"" and ""Spice World"" for two reasons: one, it has an actual narrative, unlike ""Spice World""; and two, unlike that American Idol movie, the songs in ""Glitter"" were quite listenable.  In many ways, this is a mirror image to the Britney Spears movie, ""Crossroads"", which I thought was okay.  Both it and ""Crossroads"" are self-indulgent with their leading singer, both deal with mommy issues, and both---ahem---""struggle"" to reach a certain career that they desire. But while ""Crossroads"" could focus on other characters besides the singer and she had to face trials to get ahead of herself, this movie is all about Mariah Carey and she's not taking the hard route.

The movie's set in the 1980s, even though the characters didn't act, dress, or walk like it's the '80s. Billie Frank (Carey) and her two best friends since orphanage tried to get into the music. Billie's voice was heard by a Disk Jockey named Dice, and Dice decided to buy her off of her manager, played by Terrance Howard; amusingly enough, Dice didn't pay him up front and yet he acquired the mixed-breed anyway (not a wise decision,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DJay/dp/B000BITUWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DJay</a>). From then on, Billie heads the career stardom as the movie practically ignored her friends just for more of Billie and a bit of her relationship with Dice.

Billie's journey is how the movie truly faltered. There's no tension or effort in her progress, she's essentially getting a free ride to fame; no real struggle to care or get involved. Even if there's scenes that have potential for drama, they quickly gets shuffled over: when Billie has trouble wearing a bikini on a video shoot, Dice just dragged her off stage; when her manager threatened Billie over Dice's debts, Dice proceeds to beat the crap out of the manager in the next scene; finally, the heated argument between Billie and Dice due to business arrangements was only brief. The only dramatic moment that stood out was a pretty tragic one, but it happened on the final ten minutes, which led to Billie's impromptu song that the concert band somehow harmonize without knowing the track in advance. Plus, that led to one of the most cop-out endings I've ever laid my glowing face on.

""Glitter"" is so easy on the lead character, so superficial on the dilemmas that there's nothing substantial worth seeing; nevermind how horrible the editing is and how warped the scene transitions are.  I would get the same premise but better execution in a film like ""Coyote Ugly""; in fact, I suggest you watch that instead.",1281916800,2,3679,4.898713826366559
1661363,1,B00005TNER,"It is not bias when I say that the best thing about this movie is Mariah Carey; that is fact.  Sadly, nothing else about this movie is even remotely worthy of the viewer's attention.  In fact, Carey's own dedication isn't really worth our attention either.  I mean, she tries, but she doesn't really succeed.

The film is your generic fluff regarding a young underprivileged aspiring singer who happens to catch a break when a DJ hears her sing in a club.  Soon she's swept away from her thankless backup gig (for a ridiculously untalented yet hilarious Padma Lakshmi) and thrown front and center in a world she isn't really used to.

Like I said; generic.

The acting here is practically atrocious, especially on the part of Max Beesley, who may give the worst male performance of the decade.  He is just wholly unbelievable, and he tries WAY TOO HARD, and unlike Carey, it shows.  To say that Carey comes off unscathed is rather preposterous since she is the focal point of this horribly bad film.  She does put in the best performance (outside of Padma, who is campy caricature deliciousness) but she isn't given anything noteworthy to do.  Da Brat is just plain awful here (any doubt?) and the rest of the supporting cast fails to do anything memorable.

In the end, I must say that my biggest disappointment was the music.  I LOVE Mariah Carey, and this time in her career (released around the time that `Butterfly' and `Day Dream' were making their universal impact) should have resulted in a brilliant soundtrack.  Instead, this album proves to be her WORST, one that is just atrocious with maybe ONE (if any) memorable song.

In the end the film turns out to be sappy, predictable and sloppy.  Nothing comes together right here.  Carey is a phenomenal singer, one of the best to ever grace the earth with her presence, but she is no actress (well, she was OUTSTANDING in `Precious', but that is another story).  When all is said and done though, even a great actress couldn't have rescued this remarkably uninteresting and unaffecting film disaster.",1276646400,2,2057,4.746478873239437

1661386,1,B00005TNER,"I can't even begin to tell you how bad this movie is!

""WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS""

It starts out with Billi Frank as a biracial child (no suprise there considering the fact that this is very losely based on Mariah Carey, also played by Mariah Carey), of an struggling, single black mother.  Her white father barely pays child support.  So when her mother loses her job at the jazz club (she's a singer by the way), and the building is set on fire, due to her mother's carelessness, Billi is sent to live in an orphanage, there she meets her two friends.

Flashforward to the present, she and her two best friends from the orphanage, are grown up and backup singers for a Jennifer Lopez like woman, who is wrost then Jlo.  Well as the story goes on, the DJ hears Billi's voice in the background and meets Billi.  Then they become lovers.

And from there on, it gets very stupid and bad.  I mean this movie was so boring it's not even funny!  I don't think that acting is Mariah's area anyways.  And who the heck is Max Beesley?

A film that, without the barest hint of shame or irony, features as a centerpiece the Robert Palmer song, ""I Didn't Mean to Turn You On.""

I think the timing was just bad for this movie. And it didn't help that it was set in the decade of decadence and excess (the 80's) in New York. Who wanted to see NYC like that on the big screen after the devastation of 9/11? We were greiving for NYC at that time.  We surely didn't care that Mariah Carey had a movie coming out. I suggest you give this movie a try. It's not a masterpeice by any stretch of the imagination, but it's fun to watch.

1661406,3,B00005TNER,"With ""Crash"",""Lackawanna Blues"" and ""Hustle and Flow"" receiving rave reviews,and in last year's ""Ray"", Terrence is riding high right now, and since the early 90s, has been in an incredible amount of movies and miniseries (and music videos).

And then there was ""Glitter"". This film could have easily derailed his career but compared to some megaton loads of excess that have been released in the theaters (Showgirls), I don't think many people had high expectations in her acting ability to begin with. Madonna had already blazed that trail, and the only good movies she seemed to be in were where she was in a supporting role.

I think that because she is overly self-conscious, it winds up in the film, there are love scenes, daytime soaps show way more. A little bit violent, but not too... I guess this is her ""Xanadu"" at best, but Olivia had ""Grease"" on her resume. Mariah had a short scene in ""The Bachelor"". Max Beesley (Dice)is a good actor, and this one must've hurt him for a while because he was one of the main characters. Terence plays the bad guy Timothy, and the scenes between Max and Terence are as good as the film gets, but it has the feel of a PG film. Had it not been a vanity flick trying to appeal to a wide audience, the film would've fared better.

The story? Remake of a remake of ""A Star Is Born"" mixed with a little bit of ""Purple Rain"" made for Lifetime?

1661416,4,B00005TNER,"This movie is a compelling multi-tiered story of a burgeoning love affair and a phenomenally talented singer's rise to prominence.  Mariah Carey is stunning in her portrayal of Billie Franks.  There are literally insufficient accolades to capture the magnificence of her voice. This movie engages one emotionally, as one finds himself cheering for Billie's successes and lamenting her losses. The movie also offers an interesting albeit superficial perspective of the music industry.

Max Beesley gives a remarkable performance as Dice, Billie's love interest.  Mariah also performs credibly in her acting debut.  Billie is abandoned as a child by her mother due to economic pressures and is raised in the foster care system of New York City.  Billie forms life-long friendships with two other girls whom she meets in a foster-care facility. The movie carries the friendship forward in a seamless fashion.

Billie and her companions secure back-up singer roles with a pathetically untalented and narcissitic singer. Dice, a popular DJ, discovers that the untalented singer is duping the public by lip-syncing to Billie's extraordinary vocals.  Shortly thereafter, Dice convinces Billie to allow him to produce her music. In the process of gaining substantial eminence in the music industry, Billie and Dice fall in love.  Old debts resurface in Dice's life and cause turbulence in their relationship. Tragically, Bilie and Dice's love affair ends at the moment of Billie's realization of her dreams.

She tries to cross over into other entertainment mediums she knows nothing about such as acting. What happens when said singer tries to act with no training? You get the disaster known as ""Glitter.""

""Glitter"" doesn't ""Sparkle"" for Mariah Carey or help her attain her the ""Fame"" of her 80's contemporary Irene Cara. The plot is so predictable you know what's going to happen after watching the opening credits. Billie Frank abandoned by her mother and sent to a group home is going to grow up and MAKE IT BIG. On this journey down the yellow brick road to the riches her manager ""Dice"", two group home buddies and a cat that replaces Toto. Sadly the cat is smart enough to split halfway through this nightmare of a film and not come back until near the final act. If only I were as lucky as he is.

The story is supposed to be about life in New York City in 1983. I never got a sense of that period watching that film. (I grew up in NYC during the 80's and I wish it were that nice or that safe.) Glitter looked like the Disneyfied 2001 New York City not the grim gritty 1983 New York City. There was no ""urban jungle"" of burnt out buildings, dilapidated apartments, junkies, graffiti painted subways and dirty streets. Music was important to people because it was the only thing besides education that gave them hope in all that despair. For a lot of people it was their only ticket out of the ghetto. Had the producers of this film studied the era they put this film in (Fort Apache, the Bronx, Krush Groove, and Beat Street would have been great reference material to use for research) they would have understood how the dark mood of the city motivated so many to work towards their dreams. Instead they develop a shallow screenplay that glosses over those important that would improve the story and ignores cinematic details like mood, tone and atmosphere that would have made this boring film somewhat interesting. A story set in the REAL grim gritty 1983 NYC would give Billie some REAL motivation to beat the odds and make it big. She'd be singing her heart out because there would be no way else to go but in the grave.

The horrible cinematography makes Pearl Harbor's quick cut editing appears Oscar worthy. The camera doesn't stay in one place but a second before moving someplace else. I had to wonder if the cinematographer had ADHD. If you look closely you'll realize there isn't a close up to be found in this film, every shot is a wide shot that keeps you from focusing on the actor's faces. I guess the director was trying to cover for how bad the acting is in this film. And boy, does it stink. I've seen better acting in an eighth grade play than in this film.

Mariah Carey is wretched in the role of Billie Frank. She has a grand total of TWO facial expressions: Happy and confused. That's some acting range. Irene Cara (Sparkle) Diana Ross (Lady Sings the blues, Mahogany) and Judy Garland (A star is born) at least had some screen presence and gave good performances. Eric Benet is the only person to give a WORSE performance (ONE facial expression; a silly grin.) Everyone else phones it in realizing ""all hope is lost,"" praying no one will see them in this horror of a movie or see it on their resume.

Unless you're a MST3K producer looking for a film Mike and the bots to bash avoid this trash. Get A star is born, The Five Heartbeats, or Sparkle. Both of those films are far superior to this.",1097712000,5,3519,4.458074534161491

1661433,2,B00005TNER,"A film by Vondie Curtis-Hall
There are some movies you watch because you think it is going to be a good movie and what you know about the movie sounds interesting.  There are other movies that you watch simply because of all of the negative press about the movie and you wonder if the film can really be as bad as ""everyone"" has said.  ""Glitter"" falls into the second category of movies.  This was Mariah Carey's first starring role (after a small supporting role in ""The Bachelor""), and both the movie as well her acting were absolutely trashed by critics and ""Glitter"" was a box office bomb.
Mariah Carey stars as Billie Frank, a rising pop star in the early 80's.  We open the film when Billie is only a child.  Her mother is a longue singer (or perhaps, a bar singer) who brings Billie on stage so they can sing together.  Her mother seems weary of everything, and when their house burns down (it is implied that the mother is the accidental cause), young Billie is put into foster care.  We are flashed forward to the early 80's and Billie is dancing (with her friends, presumably the two she met in the group home) in a club.  She is signed to sing backup for a solo artist, but it is really Billie's voice that is being used to sell the records.  This is a rags to riches story where Billie starts out with nothing and with the help of a producer (Max Beesley) who hears Billie sing, ends up to be a star.  It mirrors, in a way, the story of Mariah Carey herself.
So, is ""Glitter"" really as bad as its reputation suggests?  No.  It couldn't possibly be.  ""Glitter"" is your average rags to riches film and is simply an average movie.  What this movie does is give Mariah a vehicle to show off her singing ability.  It's a movie about a singer going from the smalltime to the big time.  ""Glitter"" seemed to exist more to give Mariah...excuse me, Billie...another opportunity to sing rather than give the character the chance to grow or develop (and thus give Mariah a chance to show off her acting ability).  ""Glitter"" is a completely standard, ordinary movie.  There are certainly worse movies out there, but then again, there are certainly better movies out there, too.  ""Glitter"" is not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, so I can't recommend it (not even a little bit), but it is also not nearly as bad as has been reported.

1661434,2,B00005TNER,"(...).I can't really sum it up all in one phrase so I'll just rate each aspect of this almost-disaster:
Acting(2.5/5):The acting is maybe the best thing out of this movie,and that's not really saying much. But,you have to admit Mariah did a pretty good job in this movie as an abandoned orphan turned aspiring singer(big stretch) named Billie. Maybe if it wasn't for the horrible supporting actors and actresses(Billie's love interest,DA BRAT!),this movie would be better. And the arguements between Billie and the other guy(he did so horribly I don't even want to remember his name) are so unemotional and contain so much ingenuity that you can't help but laugh!
Plots(2/5):Glitter is to original as hot is to cold. This movie has so much over-used plots that it's hard to sit through this movie and not say ""Hey,I've seen that before!""Sure,some plots are pretty good(Billie trying to find her abandoned mother;the mother-daughter thing is one of the only good parts of the movie,(...)),but a story about an aspiring singer falling in love with a guy?Been there,done that WAY too many times!
Production(1/5):Since this movie is based in the '80's,it's hard to not believe that the movie wasn't made in the '80's,too! Can you say corny?Right when you finally get into a good part of the movie(i.e.,Billie's drug-addict mother stupidly burning their house),all of a sudden,here comes a stupid fade-out(in white,in fact),or here comes some tacky slow motion sequence with,what do you expect,glitter all around! And the music...Mariah,you have been doing,well,very badly in the music department ever since Rainbow. And the sad part is,Mariah is a producer in the movie!
Overall(2/5):Now I'm not saying the movie is COMPLETELY horrible...it's lame,but not a horrible bomb. Mariah is very lucky she did a pretty good job in this film,or else I would've rated this one star!

From the outside I couldn't see what was so bad about it. The plot seemed good: a young girl trying to make it was as a singer in the '80s. I decided I would have to see it for myself. I looked at the local video store but it was no where to be found. Then one day I saw the movie being advertised on VH1. After about 3 years 'Glitter' was finally having its first network premiere! Last night I stayed up to watch it. Well part of it anyway. I couldn't even get through half of the movie. It was that bad. The acting in the movie is horrible. The actors seem to try so hard but it comes off as being completely fake. Mariah Carey's acting is especially poor. She just stands there and smiles, showing no emotion whatsoever.

Avoid at all costs unless you think movies like 'Gigli' and 'Dude Where's My Car?' are works of art.",1076803200,4,1204,4.216450216450217
1661442,2,B00005TNER,"I watched Glitter; because I am a fan of Mariah Carey. I was dubious about watching it due to the reviews, but I had to cast my own opinion, and I found it to be an average movie, though drawn out a bit too long.
Though meant to be a drama, i found this movie at my video store in the science/fantasy section... so was confused if it should have been in the drama or comedy quarter.
I dound Mariah's acting to be lacking; and at times comical when she tries to act cool or angry. She was transparent in some scenes, but I truly found the scene at the end of the movie, where she reunites with her mother that gave her up at 12..to be genuine acting. I saw it in her eyes that she WANTED to act this scene to its all, and it worked cause it got me, especially when she broke-down. I know that feeling!. It touched me, but maybe thats from personal experience..
Also, in terms of Mariah's poor acting abilities; shamefully, Mariah as a child, produced a better performance than her adult contemporary..She had sad doeful eyes and showed angst and dispair when she had to leave her mothers care.
Fast forward to Mariah/Billie as an adult and this is where I had to laugh, with Mariah trying desperately to look like a sex-bomb dancer in a club; she looked cheap, tarty and poor. Maybe it was for the 80's but still, she looked like crap. I liked Da Brat, looking happily heavy and funky, her friend..no comment. I did like it though when the showed up the tone deaf singer, Sylk..I liked that bit..and Ace djcute to look at but one of the worst tryhards I had ever seen on film.
Another scene i have to give credit to Mariahs limited acting range, would be when and she HAS to go on with the show and perform to thousands of fans at Madison Square gardens, with the pain of knowing, just minutes before she graces the stage, her love (dj jULIAN/aCE)has been killed. She demonstrated some acting talent, but her vocal range is still showcased in this filn, though her acting range isnt. It doesn't help that the release date for cinemas was Sept 11; as who would've been going to the pictures during that dark week?? Plus, Mariah had to much to prove, and the timing both globally and for her own personal self, was wrong. If it had been released before or sometime after, I am certain it wouldn't have had such HARSH HARSH reviews as was delivered.
I concur with many other reviewers, her (Mariah) Britney , Madonna and Dianna Ross should closely peruse and screen their next cinematic choices or at least take up serious coaching for the craft of acting.

1661450,1,B00005TNER,"First, I need to justify the reason why I rented this film: I simply wanted to have a good laugh, because I knew it had won a lot of Golden Raspberries, and there's Mariah Carey in it, so it had to be really awful.
Awful it was. We follow the very ordinary and pathetic path of a young woman who suddenly becomes a superstar. Wow! How original! I heard that even though Mariah is playing a fictional character, the story is inspired by Mariah's career. I guess she just added some semi-dramatic (as we are trying not to laugh when something bad happens to her) elements in the story to make it an even bigger cliche collection.
There are no SO ridiculous or absurd parts in this film, because it stays very simple (and I don't think anyone from this film has the IQ to go for something more complex), but it really simply sucks. There are many scenes where the director clumsily put occasions for Mariah to show her supposedly amazing voice. I guess that gave Mariah a reason to release a new album and make more money (and also get fired from her label HA HA!). When you get to the rolling credits, you just can't understand how the film could last one hour and forty minutes and leave you with the impression that you slept for one hour and forty minutes, even if you didn't. This film is empty. Period.
With some awful acting from Mariah Carey, who should first: stop acting and second: stop singing, you are left with the impossible belief that they took her as the lead actress. She never sounds natural, she will get on your nerves with her shallow acting when she tries to demonstrate feelings other than simply smiling like an idiot like she does all the time on MTV. I know that may sound very mean, but it really leaves you that impression, especially if you don't really like pop music/movies. As an actress, she has no charisma, physically (I really don't think this woman is attractive at all) and she simply doesn't have a believable enough psychological aspect in her character to mention it. She is not the only bad actress in Glitter, there's also the boyfriend. He's not EXTREMELY bad, but noticeably. The mother is also pretty awful, and the black guy that is some kind of ""gangster"" is one of the worst.
The directing is conventional, it has nothing special, nothing good, nothing bad, except for the fact that it gives a product entitled ""Glitter"". That's all I had to say for the directing.
Overall, ""Glitter"" is, without being the worst thing I've seen in my life, a very pathetic piece of cinema and a very meaningful failure for Mariah Carey. Shallow, narcissistic, cliche, stupidly dramatic, badly acted, with average directing, ""Glitter"" is, in the purest meaning of the word, a WASTE of time.
It didn't glitter that much on the Box-Office, didn't it Mariah? I give it 1/10.",1065484800,11,2801,4.581673306772909

The acting was so one-dimensional, it was almost painful. The actors weren't engaging and i honestly wouldn't have been surprised if they had been holding the scripts and reading them off to each other-it would have had the same effect. Mariah Carey is without a doubt one of the most talented singers out there today and i think her vocal range is mindblowing- but you don't have to be a ""redneck"" to see that this movie totally blows. I swear, if she ever makes a movie again, I'm going to move to another country, so I won't even be associated with a country that would actually make a SECOND piece of crap like this",1058572800,10,912,4.402366863905326
1661455,1,B00005TNER,"I saw this movie about two months after it was first released.  I went to a theatre where admission was only $2.00.  Lucky considering all the bad reviews I had read.  It proved to be as bad as one could expect.  It was just a [bad] movie, plain and simple.  It was very reminiscent of its more successful predecessors such as ""The Rose,""  ""A Star Is Born"" and ""Mahogany"" to name a few.  All the positive reviews are no doubt from Mariah's legions of fans (to whom she affectionately refers to as ""lambs."" Sheep is more like it).  Here's a quick rundown of the ""plot"" for those of you who have yet to see it (don't bother):  As a little girl, Mariah's character Billie Frank (said to be tribute to two of Mariah's real-life idols Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra) is turned over to child welfare after her alcoholic and/or drug addicted mother (it never really is specified) nearly gets both of them killed in a house fire.  Flash forward about fifteen years later to 1983 where Billie, and her friends since childhood, Louise (Da Brat, who does a wonderful job here as the comedy relief) and Roxanne (Tia Texada) get an offer to sing back up for an attractive, albeit tone-deaf singer named Sylk.  It is at Sylk's lyp synched performance to a track featuring Billie's voice that Billie and company meet a DJ named Julian ""Dice"" Black (Max Beesely, in the only other stand-out role in the film).  He sweet talks Billie into letting him produce her. Within a matter of weeks, she with record deal in hand, ends up getting him in the sack.  The rest is pretty predictable.  Stardom eventually leads to lost friendships, lost love relationships and death.  This film (I'm sorry to even admit it) had the potential to be an okay movie.  There were certain points where the movie tries to be poignant and touching i.e. like when Billie finds out that Dice has been murdered or when she is finally reunited with her long-lost mother.  The sad, but all too obvious fact is Mairah's stiff wooden-like acting and inability to emote onscreen doesn't allow the aforemntioned scenes to have the impact they were intended to.  It is also further proof that Mariah should have stuck to singing and that the filmmakers could have casted a more convincing leading lady.  The box office failure had little to with the release date.  It could have been released in theatres six months prior to September 11th and it, no doubt, would have still earned the same acidic reception and scathing reviews, if not more so. An interesting side note about ""Glitter"" is the same screenplay writer also wrote the script to the far superior Oscar-nominated Tina Turner biopic ""What's Love Got To Do With It.""  Imagine that.

All in all, the movie was only about a star and a half.  It was an overused, poorly constructed formula that seemed to very much be a direct rip off of the three aformentioned films.  One review I had read beforehand had described this movie as ""The Mariah Carey Vanity Project"" and that's EXACTLY what it was.  Like it or not, not every entertainer who tries their hand at acting is good at it.  In my opinion, the only good singers-turned-actors are:  Cher, Bette Midler, Janet Jackson, Aaliyah (R.I.P.), DMX, Busta Rhymes and, even though I hate to admit it, Diana Ross.  If you're looking for a great story, then rent ""Postcards From the Edge.""  Its star Meryl Streep is living proof that just because you are good in one realm of the entertainment biz, doesn't mean you automatically HAVE to do the other.",1058400000,12,3504,4.642857142857143

The movie is uninspired, as is the acting. It boggles the mind what makes pop divas think that because they can sing well, that they can also act. This has only proven true with a few artists, and the others are simply not acting material. Mariah would fall into that category. Her acting lacks emotion and drive, it seems like she is shifting from scene to scene just being there, like scenery. The supporting cast is better, but not much either. The script is a mess too, after a few scenes in the beginning when we see Carey's character being taken away, we're supposed to feel compassion but it doesn't happen. Basically the movie is just to show off Mariah's vocal skills which we already knew she had. Plain and simple.

She isn't downright awful, she's just flat.. not even trying to be herself, yet she can't manage to put anything into her character... As a result, one can't identify strongly with the protagonist (Billie) and any her supposed struggles, feelings etc..
As a showcase for Mariah's vocal talent, It works fine.. the lady can definitely blow! But we all knew that already.. They seem to rely on the supporting cast a great deal to get any sort of effect from Mariah's performance.. While I admire her as a songwriter and singer, and I realise that this was a tough time for her, she just isn't a very strong actress. As a result, this movie is just plain tedious.. and even in that context, it doesn't even have any redeeming camp value whatsoever..it's just dull.

1661462,4,B00005TNER,"With all the hype of the critics saying it was a terrible movie I started watching it thinking it's probably not as bad as the critics say it is and even if it is Max Beesley(Dice)looks hot so at least I can watch it for him. I never expected I would be so moved and touched by this movie. Don't listen to the bad reviews this movie is great.
Mariah's acting was nowhere near terrible and that goes to the entire actor's in the film. It's a wonderful cast and the actors played and fitted their parts perfectly. Max Beesley plays all the instruments his character plays in the movie unlike some actors who fake playing the instruments, as he is a musician in real life, so he played his character really well. Mariah's emotional scenes were very realistic and her character's two friends Roxy and Louise(Tia Texada, Da Bratt) really liven up the film. Terrence Howard's character(Timothy Walker) is really good; We really grow to hate him at the end of the movie.
The story line may seem a bit cheesy but as you watch the film it does have depth. There is a twist in the movie that is so powerful and unexpected that makes the movie become deep and emotional. The only thing I would say that was a slight disappointment was the note from Dice read in Mariah's voice. It so should have been Dice's voice but due to legal reasons it had to be Mariah's. The Director said the impact was stronger in Dice's voice but it still works which I agree with.
The soundtrack is equally as good as the movie. The tracks blend nicely together and you hear two short bits of dialog from the film in between tracks. One from Roxy and Louise and another from Timothy Walker but I think we should of heard some of Dice's dialog, as he was a main character. Maybe I'm overreacting cause I have a soft spot for the actor. The DVD features are good as you get two music videos, trailer and director's commentary, which can be interesting. I think it would of been better if there was behind the scenes footage and interviews with the actors.
I would recommend if you haven't seen this film you should watch it. You will be pleasantly surprised on how good it is. The critics got it wrong this movie is excellent and didn't deserve the bad reviews it got, it shines.",1054771200,2,2244,4.409638554216867
1661463,2,B00005TNER,"It's kind of ironic that ""The Bodyguard"" was a box-office hit while ""Glitter"" was a box-office bomb.  Whitney Houston's acting was even more wooden than Mariah Carey's, and comparatively, the story was less believable.  And the music in ""Bodyguard"" was worse.
""Glitter's"" story is actually pretty good, if a bit tired.  Mariah Carey plays Billie Frank, a beautiful young woman who faces down hard times and despair to become a national singing success in mid-1980's New York.  The camera work and pacing is actually pretty good; the movie doesn't drag along excessively.  Great performances by Da Brat (who knew!) and Tia Texada as Billie's backup singers and girlfriends keep it real, and Max Beesley puts in a decent performance as Billie's manager / love interest, Dice.
The biggest problem with ""Glitter,"" I think, is that it's Mariah Carey in a starring role.  She's trying hard, to be sure, but she's not leading lady material.  I think that people love to hate her because of her bigger than life marketing and those sappy songs.  That would be a good reason, I guess.  (Note to Jennifer Lopez:  BEWARE!).  It's hard to believe that she could take herself seriously although if you compare what she's made musically to what Elton John or Cher has turned out in the past ten or so years, she's a little less campy by comparison.
There are some funny parts in ""Glitter"", especially the video shoot and the time she thinks she found her estranged mother and it turns out to be a junkie,  but it's sappy and a little contrived and yet strangely earnest. The Muppets probably would done this a little better (Miss Piggy as Billie Frank!  Awesome!)...",1050883200,14,1652,4.815602836879433
1661464,2,B00005TNER,"Can I even keep my review a minimum of 1000 words?  For starters, this has got to be one of the worst movies made in recent years.  Right up there with Xanadu, Endless Love, and Grease 2.  The story is a very simple one about how a girl who lived a tough life and ends up as the biggest pop star of her day.
For starters, any period piece for a show-business story should NOT be set in the 80s.  The costumes are far too distracting to care about anything else most of the time.
The acting is at best really [bad].  Mariah Carey, who can sing like nobody's business, does not have the same acting ability.  Her facial expression doesn't change at all throughout the whole film, and her line delivery can be anywhere from wooden to hamming it up.  I forgot this movie wasn't supposed to be a scene from a soap opera.
The writing itself is just sacriledge.  Full of really bad phrases and[] sentences, you just cringe hearing some of them.  To give you a taste: ""The glitter can't overpower the artist,"" ""Shake your chi-chi,"" and my favorite, ""Woe is me?  What the hell is that?""  Even Dawson's Creek was written better than this.
Now, the story is just plain sad.  So many important details are overlooked and just poorly explained.  In the beginning, the mother falls asleep on the couch and drops a lit cigarette between the cushions.  The house burns down, and the viewer is supposed to understand that the mother has a substance abuse problem?  Just because someone gets drunk one in the beginning doesn't mean they're an alcoholic.  Show her trying to go on without it, or going through desperate measures to get some liquor and then I'll buy it.  And how about the cat that disappears thoughout most of the movie and then all of a sudden is back?
I can't go on much more.  This film is not bad enough to be good.  In fact, it is way too convoluted to even be appreciated on that level.  The only thing worth discovering in this movie is the soundtrack (hence 2 stars), but other than ""Never Too Far,"" none of the music is good enough to save this sorry excuse for a motion picture.",1050192000,4,2086,4.396866840731071

She accepts, but not knowing there are some hidden strings attached to this once and a lifetime oppertunity.  Another subplot is Billie attempting to find her mother, with no luck.  I'm not going to reveal the rest of the storyline because I want you to see it for yourself, and not judge the movie based on all the bad reviews.  It also stars the R&B singer Eric Benet who meets Billie later in the movie.  The DVD includes Trailers, Director's Commentary and music videos for ""Loverboy (remix)"" and ""Never too far"" (great for us who don't get MTV!).  Overall I would reccomend ""Glitter"" to anyone who was thinking about seeing it but didn't get to.

Every scene screamed a dual message:  that Mariah/Billie was the most talented singer in the world, and that she was the most beautiful woman in the world.  I came away from the movie convinced that both were as far from the truth as possible.  Nearly every action and every line of dialogue was a cliche.  Even the ""dramatic plot twists"" that they threw at us came off as silly and annoying.  We found ourselves laughing hysterically at a movie that was trying to be high drama and yet fell very short.  Also, we literally lost track of the number of scenes.  It was as though they wanted to put in as many very brief scenes (most of which went nowhere) as they possibly could.  If we could sit through it again we'd probably count the scenes, and wouldn't be surprised if there turned out to be over a hundred scenes, many of which lasted less than a minute.

1661479,3,B00005TNER,"I viewed this film with some trepidation, given the panning it got from the critics. Well, to my surprise, it is nowhere near the worst movie of the year. While it is not in the same league as the film, ""A Star Is Born"", from which it borrows heavily, it is certainly not without some redeeming qualities.

The film basically chronicles the rags to riches story of talented singer, Billie Frank (Mariah Carey). Her mother, a woman with a substance abuse problem, sang in dives for a living, before abandoning Billie to the custody of the state. Motherless, Billie grew into a lovely, young woman. Having inherited her mother's talent, she, too,  became a singer, working as part of a trio, until discovered by DJ of the Year, Dice (Max Beesley).
Dice, in effect, becomes her manager and producer. They also become an item, until his svengali act wears a bit thin. Struggling to be her own person, they part company still loving each other. Just before disaster strikes, they realize just how much each loves the other. Billie also realizes that, despite personal trials and tribulations, the show must go on.
While Mariah's performance has been heavily criticized, I think that she has taken a drubbing that has not been totally warranted. Her singing in the film is top notch, though her acting, admittedly, is a bit wooden and limited. It runs the gamut from sheepish grins to deadpan delivery. She needs work in the acting department, no doubt about it.
Max Beesley, however, is surprisingly  good in the role of Dice,  though he is hampered somewhat by the screenplay. His lines are not much better than Mariah's, though his delivery of the lines is superior to that of her delivery. The rest of the cast is fine, doing the best that they can with the lines with which they have to work.
Part of the problem, obviously, is the material with which the cast had to work. Kate Lanier's screenplay is nothing to write home to mother about, with stilted dialogue and a story line that fades once it stops borrowing from ""A Star Is Born"". The thing to do, when borrowing heavily from another film, is to do it better not worse. In this, the screenplay fails.
The screenplay, however, is not the only problem with this film. Director Vondie Curtis Hall was a trifle ham handed in his direction, at times. This is no surprise, if his his commentary, which was surprisingly inarticulate, is any indication.
Still, though not the best film, it is far from the worst. If one is not, however, a Mariah Carey fan, deduct one star from my review.",1025308800,14,2536,4.666666666666667
1661480,3,B00005TNER,"Although critics disdainfully trashed the movie and its leading lady, Mariah's movie debut is an entree into the world of acting and Hollywood. Mariah's reputation as an actress is secure because she not only produced the movie, she also produced the soundtrack. Society and media needs to acknowledge Mariah's potential as an actress instead of having a disdainful view toward her.
""Glitter"" shows how her character(Billie) rose to musical stardom despite her hardships. Her mother was an extraordinary taleted jazz singer who is down on her luck due to her drug and alcohol addiction.  Billie's father is a rich married white guy who had a one night stand with her mother and have never showed any interest in her at all. He simply threw money at her mother who was recently fired from the nightclub and told them never to show up in the affluent neighborhood again. Her mother was forced to give up her lovely daughter after an accidental fire in their run down house, due to carelessness, to a state-run orphanage. Once again, her father didn't take her in. Her mother promised that she would fetch for her once she got herself clean.  The truth is that she never cleaned herself of drug and alcohol and was shown roaming the streets of New York until later in the film when she finally cured herself of those things that ailed her. The film never fully explained the cause of her addiction.
Billie met her two companions, Roxie and Louise, at the orphanage, who were played by Tia Texada and Da Brat respectively, who became her lifelong friends. The three were eventually adopted into a loving family who genuinely cared for them until adulthood.
In the early 80s, Billie was given a chance to shine in the entertainment world with help from her soon-to-be boyfriend named Dice, a little-known New York DJ who first discovered her singing talent when she was a backup singer for mediocre singer Sylk. She moved into her boyfriend's house soon after and he helped her develop her musical talent.  Trouble came later when her boyfriend became resentful of her astronomical success as well as an unpaid debt to her old producer who is Silk's boyfriend.  She broke up afterwards.  Then she hook up with an aspiring singer played by Halle Berry's husband, Eric Benet, who had done a duet with her.  Then later on in the film, her ex-boyfriend was murdered and she and her mother finally reunited in rural Maryland at the end of the film.

Nonetheless, I bought it previously viewed from Blockbuster and was excited about the Director's Commentary. What in goodness's name could Vondie Curtis-Hall possibly say about one of America's Most Hated films?
Nothing much, is the answer. During his full-lenth commentary, Curtis-Hall stutters, ""umm""s, and fragments his sentences more than a third grader. It's unbelievable. The actual direction of Glitter was okay, but it's a good thing he didn't become an English teacher. He has little insight on making the film and I wonder if he was actually present or if he was just taking the credit for someone who didn't want to be associated with the project.
The music video for Loverboy is great eye-candy (did you notice those pink shorts??) and the video for Never Too Far is a waste (considering it's the same sequence that's in the movie...why not just use chapter selections and get there?).

As a fan, its not hard for me to watch Glitter, but I do want to be objective as well.  I feel that Glitter wasn't a bad movie.  I have defintely seen far worse.  I believe this movie was more suited for television or maybe a cable spot, but not big screen theater.  The plot of course was somewhat predictable to a certain degree.  It just didn't seem made for big screen theater.  What people fail to realize is all that Ms. Carey did to get this project off the ground.  She did more than just show up and act in this movie.  From what I understand she was very instrumental in many aspects of production or direction etc.  And I believe that for someone's first big screen movie, for her to have so much input, that is pretty good.  Mariah's acting isn't bad either.  The acting isn't the problem in this movie, perhaps the subject matter is a little predictable.

As for Mariah Carey, I have seen worse actors, but her performance is, for the most part, vapid and colorless. And she should slap her hairdresser and makeup artists. She wears her hair in a ridiculous one-sided ponytail that looks hilarious and when she is made up, she looks like Kathi Lee Gifford.

1661494,1,B00005TNER,"Following the lead of many pop divas who want to make the transition from the music charts to the box office, Mariah Carey stars in this big-budget turkey that had flop written all over it from the start. In a film that she claims is semi-autobiographical, Mariah proves that she no longer is the sweetheart of the mainstream American pop scene in what many will see as an attempt by Ms. Carey to move from predominately caucasian audiences to one that is urban.
In ""Glitter,"" Carey plays Billie Frank, a biracial child who was the product of a fling between a black lounge singer and a married caucasian man. Billie, who is placed in a foster home and grows up there with the support of two friends (played by rapper Da Brat and Tia Texeda) appears to be on the verge of major success. While singing back up for a talentless singer named Sylk, Billie is discovered by a New York deejay, Julian Dice (played by Max Beesley), who pours his energy into producing the next big thing in the New York music scene.
As the movie progresses, Billie and Julian develop a relationship that not only involves romance, but also plenty of success along the way. Ultimately, like in many romances there is a tragic ending, however the film ends with a positive conclusion that some might find heartbreaking (not to me). The film, which was supposed to be Mariah's vehicle to film stardom was also tied to the release of an album by the same name under her new short-lived contract with Virgin Records (that contract was canceled and Mariah was given a fee to walk away from the company due to the terrible sales of the album) was a major dud upon its' release in theaters and soon found itself on video store shelves soon after.
""Glitter,"" directed by Vonde Curtis Hall, is not an Oscar-calibre film worth watching. If you are tired of hearing about Mariah's antics on the news, than this film won't help you relieve you from such pain. Besides the fact that film has excellent zooming of scenes and the fact that in one scene we can see both towers of the World Trade Center still standing before that horrible day in September 2001, there is not a reason in this world to watch this turkey. Someone should have named this film ""Butterball,"" because just like a turkey, it stuffed with ... and will put you to sleep in a short time. ""Glitter"" only gives us proof that Mariah is over the hill and that she not only alienated audiences due to the bad publicity she had in 2001, but also due to her confusion about her ethnic roots. Mariah was born on Long Island, New York, and not in New York City. Mariah's mother is Irish (as in caucasian) and her father is of mixed Afro-European descent (he is Venezuelan). Mariah was discovered due to the good deed her friend, singer Brenda K. Starr, did for her when she forwarded a tape of Mariah's vocals to Sony Music Head Tommy Mottola (Mariah's ex-husband). Therefore if she claims this is a semi-autobiographical film, than Mariah must be on something if she can't honestly tell her own life story.
If you are looking for a sedative, ""Glitter"" is the film for you. If you're not, skip this Ishtar-esque flop and look for something else to watch.",1017187200,11,3177,4.555944055944056

I also love the last scene when Mariah shows up in the middle of the country in a limosine, decked out in a glamourous gown, reuniting with her long lost mother and then having an emotional breakdown.

There was some shots of the WTC which is a little spooky.  If they had released the movie in mid-summer as planned I believe it would have done much better.

True, the plot is stuffed full of every rags to riches cliche from 100 movies past, but for some reason it all worked for me.  I was especially impressed with the fact that Mariah wrote most of the music for the film, which was used very effectively.  I thought the song ""Reflections"" was especially touching.  I actually found the character Mariah played in this movie more endearing then the ""real"" Mariah.  Just watch the ""Loverboy"" video on the disc and you'll know what I mean.  Mariah is not great, but she does not embarass herself either.  The music fits perfectly into the movie, and you can tell that a lot of hard work was put in by Mariah.  So, even though the movie is not totally successful (and at times not that good), it's fun to watch someone as talented as Mariah give it a try.

With all this behind her, the last thing Mariah Carey needs is another jab at her debut movie, ""Glitter.""  But considering the rather high average rating for this DVD, I must proclaim the truth: this film is bad.  And not just bad, but over-the-top, can-they-really-take-this-seriously bad.  Mariah is Billie, a multiracial aspiring singer who gets involved with a music mogul and slowly rises to fame.  Hmmm.  Sounds a bit too similar to Carey's own real life.  But no matter.  Carey is as inept an actress as she is powerful a singer.  She may carry a scene, but what she doesn't convey is emotion--except for the unintended laughs that her performance will rouse from the audience.  I can't believe that the director even bothered to do a commentary for this dud.

This is a mediocre film built on a hackneyed, hole-ridden plot, shallow characterizations, and editing that strives for and fails to achieve true stylishness. The acting is good enough to keep the viewer from being taken `outside' the film, and suggests that, given better writers and directors, Carey could have ended up in a film that garnered more positive response. Much of animosity towards this film seems to be a reflection of viewers' animosity towards Carey herself. Her unhinged personal life and the headlines it's generated have translated into a great deal of personal contempt for her and her work.

1661516,1,B00005TNER,"It all began back in 1990, when a young music sensation with a vision of love set out to make it happen, giving us emotions deeper than we'd ever dreamed of, and warning us that someday, ooh, someday, she'd be the only one we'd be wishing for. And for a while, when this hero came along, with the strength to carry the world of music along, it seemed as if we couldn't live if living was without her.
Let it be known, Mariah Carey was a favorite during my formative years, her music providing an outlet for emotional grief as well as jubilant bliss. As I grew up, it seemed she did not, as her music generated into little more than Britney Spears for the over 30's. And like most musicians and singers, Carey decided to take the fateful step into mega-stardom by bringing her voice, her looks, and her breasts, onto the big screen.
That's where ""Glitter"" comes in, though I doubt the movie is more of a rise for the starlet than it is a crushing blow. It couldn't have come at a worse time, too, as Carey, suffering from various mental breakdowns and delusions of the booty-licious Jennifer Lopez trying to steal her fame, was more or less fragile. And while it may not be cordial to kick people when they're down, I think the atrocity that is ""Glitter"" is enough exception to this rule.
The movie is pretty much a fictionalization of Carey's own rise to stardom, beginning with the life of young girl Billie Frank, whose mother works as a lounge singer. One night, a carelessly lit cigarette results in a change in Billie's life: she is forced to leave her mother and become the property of the state, living in a child care home and making two best friends who, you guessed it, will remain by her side, through thick and thin, throughout the entire movie. This I can stomach, but I'd like someone to explain to me just how her cat, seen as a kitten in Billie's younger years, also remains by her side throughout the entire movie.
Getting back to the story, the movie skips a couple of years to find itself in 1983, where Billie is working as a backup singer, until she is discovered by famous DJ Dice (Max Beesley), who makes a deal for her contract and begins making her into a star. But while Billie wants to spread her wings and prepare to fly, Dice sees fit to rule over her decisions, his antics keeping her from such prestigious events as the USA Music Awards, and coming between her and her tag-along best friends.
So what's a diva to do? Leave him, go back to him, pout and leave again... you see a pattern here? Of course you do: ""Glitter"" makes it so that no event, no plot development, however well-intentioned, is not foreseen at least half an hour before it arrives. The rags-to-riches story is so old, so worn out, that the film is like a slap in the face to the intelligence of moviegoers everywhere. The movie makes attempts to get our attention with two main subplots: Billie's search for her long-lost mother, and Dice's debt to Billie's former producer. Sadly, neither of these carry enough potency to make us believe in the material.
I guess one could enjoy ""Glitter"" as an unintentional comedy, with its hilariously uproarious depiction of the 80's club scene in the Big Apple, and the abundance of lines like ""I can't do this without you"" and so forth. The real gut-buster is seeing Carey trotting around in front of the camera, putting forth her best effort, and seeing her fall flat on her face on almost every attempt. When she's not speaking, the movie almost shines; she opens her mouth, dialogue or musical number, and all that glitters is not gold.
I can't really stand up for the movie on the grounds that longtime fans of Carey's music will appreciate the effort put forth here, either. Being a fan of her many songs before the downfall that began with her ""Rainbow"" release, I'm an avid believer that when Britney Spears hit the scene, Carey got nervous, thus the release of such brainless, beatless, mainstream songs as ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Loverboy,"" one of the film's many incessantly played tracks. The soundtrack for ""Glitter,"" populated with songs from its main attraction, is little more than a testament to my theory concerning her career's slow decline; whereas Carey used to be a trend-setter, she now sees it fitting to follow suit instead.",1011916800,24,4284,4.586701434159061

I also feel that Mariah Carey wasn't given the chance to excel because of her ""breakdown"".  I don't think a breakdown necessitates critics blasting apart an entire movie over one player!  I think the story was well written and flowed nicely.  It had comedy and drama and catchy songs!

Max Beesley was also great, with a rather one-dimensional character coming to life and depth in his hands. Da Brat was also wonderful, in her too few scenes. Overall, I loved it. I'm a HUGE fan of Mariah so I knew I would like it, but I truly think anyone who watches this movie will enjoy it, if they ignore what the critics said. It's an enjoyable movie, not something that requires deep concentration or thought. So in my opinion, ""Glitter"" does glitter. And Mariah does, too.

The setting in the 80's was perfect, it wasn't fake looking or cheap, Mariah and the producers of this movie really captured the essence of the 80's with this movie. The music used (the songs that were used as background music, not the ones on her album GLITTER) were very significant of the 80's for sure. The songs she recorded for the soundtrack GLITTER speak mountains after seeing the movie, it makes far more sense now after seeing it. When you hear her sing ""Reflections (Care Enough)"", a song about wondering why her mother gave her up, and if she really cares, is heartwrenching and I think was an important part of the movie. ""Never Too Far"" is one of the most beautiful songs Mariah has written (and sang) since 1997's BUTTERFLY album.

WRONG!!! Just because the media had a field day about it doesn't mean the movie was that bad. In fact, the opposite is correct, the movie was wonderful and Carey is anything but bad in it. The idea of having the 80s theme and the soundtrack to go along with it turned out to be fantastic. The songs, the club scenes, the clothes - they all contribute to having the movie look just as if it was done in the 80s. True, the plot wasn't based on a Stephen King story. But it is so much better than half of the summer movies I've seen in the past couple of years. Mariah is a singer and she excels in playing one (Billie Frank). The rest of the crew did a great job as well. Da Brat & Tia Texada (Playing Billie's childhood friends) mostly helped the funny part of the film, Max Beesley (as Billie's love interest) - the romantic/dramatic part and even gorgeous Eric Benet with a cameo appearance did a fairly nice job. All in all, the movie is short, fun and even has a surprising ending! The music that goes along with it is an extremely big part of it and I feel bad for the reporters who dislike Carey's music and for that chose to dismiss the whole movie.

Mariah looks beautiful and it was a treat to watch her sing.  I personally really liked the soundtrack so if you view this movie as one big video you won't be disappointed.

1661532,2,B00005TNER,"I'm surprised so many people on here are giving ""Glitter"" rave reviews, given its rank in the Bottom 100 Worst Movies Ever on the IMDB.  (I'm guessing a lot of these folks are Mariah music fans, which I am admittedly not.)  I'd put it somewhere in the middle.  There are ""good"" bad movies (i.e. ""Showgirls"") and ""bad"" bad movies; ""Glitter"" falls into the second camp.  While Mariah turns out to be a surprisingly good actress -- she certainly puts Madonna to shame, much as I hate to say it -- this film never manages to transcend into being anything other than utterly banal.  Indeed, her acting skills are the only reason I'm not giving it a one-star rating.  The rags-to-riches story is as trite as it gets, and the ending is predictable within the first five minutes.  None of the characters are particularly interesting, and I didn't buy Max Beesley's ""New Yawk"" accent for even the briefest second (he plays Dice, the Love Interest, but is British in real life).  While it's not in the Worst Movie Ever Made category, ""Glitter"" has few redeeming qualities.
Then there's the small matter of period detail, which is nearly 100% off-base.  The film is (inexplicably) set in the big-hair, big-shoulders, skinny-tie era of 1983-1984, yet the characters' fashions and hairstyles look like they're fresh off the new-millennium catwalk.  Aside from Mariah's cover of Robert Palmer's ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"" -- which in the film is, in an amusingly ironic turn, supposed to be her character Billie's big debut single -- the music is late 1990s-style, not early 1980s.  Even the film's restaurants don't jibe; Asian-French fusion cuisine (consumed on Billie and Dice's first ""date"") didn't exist even in New York nearly 20 years ago.  But I'm harping here.
I'd recommend this movie only if you're a big Mariah fan and only if sappy, predictable, tragedy-laced love stories are your cup of tea.",1011225600,3,1896,4.854037267080745

Maybe she should have started with smaller roles and worked her way up, but overall she gives a convincing portrayal of Billie Frank, aspiring pop diva. The plot is the basic rags to riches story. It does move a little slow and in almost every scene someone comments on incredible her singing voice is or how beautiful she is, which gets a tad annoying, but the music is appealing, and it looks like Mariah is having a ball. This is definetly a camp classic, sort of like Showgirls. It's so bad sometimes you gotta love it just for the cheese factor. I think most people will probably hate it, but Mariah fans and fans of campy movies will fall in love with it and watch it over and over again.",1011139200,8,844,4.248447204968944

Honestly, the movie wasn't that bad - I can name quite a few films that were atrocities in their own nature.  Carey wasn't going for an Oscar-nominated performance or a ""Best Film of the Year"" trivialty; no, what was intended of ""Glitter"" was mastered.  It's an emotionally-driven film about a girl who was a stranger to herself and her music, and in her journey she found herself, her dream, and her talent renowned.  Simple as that.  I will add, however, that if the film would have been post-poned until later in Mariah's career, the writers would have a lot more information to draw upon.

The tragedy about this film is not that Mariah Carey was in it.  In fact, that was then only thing that made it watchable.  The first 5 minutes of the film set the mood of a little girl growing up to become a famous star.  But for some reason no one decided to let us see that process.  The theme for a great movie is here but it got lost on some writers desk or some producers cutting board.  It jumps for point to point.  I often found myself wondering what happened next and then all of a sudden three scenes have past.  Character development is not done at all.  Simular to The Supremes ""Billy Frank"" a.k.a. has backup singers who for some stranger reason never come out of their apartment.  They are always at home waiting for her to call them.
As a period piece it had some great moment the 80's club scene shots where nicely done but a little redundant.
Another disturbing fact about this film is that for some reason the cinematographer decided to only use shot of Mariah smiling.  Mariah is very beautiful and photogenic but I know she has more emotion that what she is shown giving.
All and all this is a fair film.  It is not her greatest work but its not Ishtar or Freddy Got Fingered either.  Definitely not recomended unless you like Mariah.

1661551,5,B00005TNER,i was very surprised with her performance. She amazed me with her talent and beauty on screen. She definately has what it takes to be an actress. I know that she will be great in her next film. She's so beautiful and talented! I love her!,1010793600,,238,4.195652173913044
1661552,5,B00005TNER,I think the movie is not NEAR as bad as everyone says it was. Mariah Carey is a magnificent singer and she doesn't deserve what's been happening to her lately. YOU GO MARIAH!

I mean I think that the critics should have given hear a break, this is just her first film, I mean look at what they said about Cher in her first movie and look at her now...I don't think that Mariah is going to let peoples negativity stop her from making more and more movies in the future. She is strong and will survive. She has million and millions of fans all over that world that support her in everything that she does and we won't allow anyone to mess her...You Go MARIAH!!!

I am not quite sure how this movie became such a critical ""joke"" - in each screening I went to in the theatres, there were tear-filled audience members waiting for credits to roll by as they dried their eyes.  ""Glitter""'s script, I thought was somewhat lacking and the continuity of the 80's vibe wasn't there (ie. why did Max Beesley have '90s hairdos and say jargon like ""aiight"" and ""crib""?), however Mariah Carey's performance was decent for a first film and I'm positive that most people will be somewhat surprised. Da Brat, Tia Texada, Terrence Howard and Ann Magnusson's performances were all highly enjoyable and you too will feel that this film was there were as an unnecessary backlash against ""Glitter"".
This movie is worth watching in your home, without the influence of snarky people in the audience persuading your perception of the film.  I predict also that ""Glitter"" will likely do much better as a ""guilty pleasure"" film on rental and DVD sales than it did in the theatre... give the ""Glitter"" a try or go ahead and jump on the bandwagon like everyone else and criticize something nobody gave a fair chance to from the get-go.",1010448000,,1308,4.658008658008658

I DID NOT SEE what everyone is talking about?! Never before have I been more proud of Mariah and all she does! She deserves so much more recognition not only for this whole project, but all the efforts she put into it. When reading the film credits, you see Mariah not only did a fine job of acting in it, she helped produce the movie, and came up with some of the concepts herself, while at the same time recorded the 12 track soundtrack which also fits the movie perfectly and gives a great flashback of those funky beats from the 80's. Everyone is entitled to their own opinon, but if you have not seen this movie just because of what everyone ""says"", you are the one missing out!!

1661570,4,B00005TNER,This film isn't the worst film in the world and it isn't the best. Mariah reached a point in her career where she wanted to try something new and this film was something new for her. Her acting skills arn't as good as good as Julia Roberts or who ever but Mariah can work on it and get better. The Story is simple but Mariah takes a cheeky stab at the way record companys control artists. There is more to the story then just rags to riches and when it comes down to it I'm sure Mariah was having fun and the film is fun and its hard for critics to understand that because everything they seem to write is negative.

This film may be a little too late to show that she can act BUT the Glitter movie showed that Mariah can give veteran actresses a run for their money. Yes, I can give you alot of details that you can look out for so you can hate this film, like poor script(the Dice verbal buy-out of Mariah/Billie from her former manager failed to convince me that such thing is possible coz there was never a contract so the former manager really can't stake a claim to Mariah/Billie unless that verbal agreement was put into writing & Dice could've have always consulted a lawyer to ask the former manager to back off since Billie is a famous star already & she can afford to protect her status from a sleaze like him) & yeah, poor visuals. They kinda concentrated on a lot of gloomy events & trouble in Billie's life but let's all see the movie's plus side for all it's worth : 1) Mariah can act, & SHE CAN ACT WELL , she's a natural, save for her consciousness on her teeth so she refuses to give a natural smile on-cam , 2) the movie was inspirational 3) the songs are good - those who thrived in the 80's era will appreciate the soundtrack 4) somehow the movie pulled an emotional plug on me, i cried in the end w/ what happened to Billie & Dice's lovestory & 5) the best thing is that, this is just Mariah's first solo-starrer!

I believe the same will be true here for Mariah Carey's ""Glitter""!  Let's face it, the movie's opening couldn't have come at a worst date.  Even if the reviews had been sensational across the board there were very few people wanting to sit in a dark theatre in September, there really wasn't a chance for the numbers to turn around for this movie.  This is a movie that you will be happy to have in your library in years to come.  I personally am not a big fan of Mariah Carey, but you have to give the woman credit.  I had wondered if after such a poor opening of this movie it would set her off into some sort of emotional spiral, but she's kept her chin up and she's kept on plucking.  Whatever her personal problems are she is out there singing to the troops and giving it her best.  Considering the lackluster opening of this film I hope can be made up in sales of the DVD!  I'd hold off on the VHS until the $$$$$ price falls!!!",1010188800,,1091,4.2270531400966185
1661573,2,B00005TNER,"The main fault with 'Glitter' lies not so much with the acting but rather more with the careless plot.
The plot is too diversified. If one were to examine most blockbuster films, it would appear that most such movies have a central event or storyline. In 'Glitter', this is not at all the case. One moment, Billie (mariah) tries to cope with finding her mother, another moment she's in the process of cutting a record, and at the same time, she's fending off the jealousy pangs of her boyfriend...All in all, there are just too many events occuring and they somewhat don't relate well to one another...
In a nutshell, the movie has covered much more breadth than depth and as a result, it becomes awfully superficial and somewhat cheesy.
It is also a somewhat badly directed movie. Why are the 'cute' transition effects appearing in this movie at all? Unless the movie was intended to be a fantasy or dreamy movie, such embellishments are simply inappropriate. Indeed, Glitter was more of serious drama rather than some whimiscal fantasy film.
I suppose the failure of Glitter could have been attributed by Mariah Carey's desire to put her life story onto the big screen. However, more thought could have given to design a specific theme, and then to include only the events that help to reinforce each other, instead of just dumping everything possible into the film.
Not surprisingly, with its whole array of events occuring randomly throughout the movie, one does get 'confused' at the end of it all. What was the most important event in the movie? Does the movie provide any meaning at all? What really was the movie trying to convey?
In the final analysis, 'Glitter' is fortunately no nighmare but rather more of an inexplicable eventful dream. You can't explain the reason for the dream, and so when you wake up, it's easy to forget the dream too.",1009929600,2,1853,4.75776397515528

Glitter is actually interesting to watch.  Both storylines keep you in suspense throughout the whole movie and the visual and musical aspects of the movie were surprising.  Honestly I didn't have faith in Mariah's acting ability at first.  Granted, she is no Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock, but she is an actress who has proven that she can handle the job.",1009929600,,504,4.693181818181818
1661575,3,B00005TNER,"I saw Glitter on the opening night and I will admit it was not a packed house (Okay, there were eight people).  Yet that did not stop me from enjoying the film. I have never been a big Mariah fan, yet somehow I thought this film might work because even if I don't always like Mariah's music, she does put in a lot of effort into her work , and it shows in Glitter.  The film was unfairly trashed by critics who just figured Mariah was another pop star trying to break into movies.  Well, she is, but Mariah does have charisma, and if anything good comes out of this film, directors will notice that Mariah has the ability to be a good  comedic actress.  She's very appealing as Billie, a young singer who rises to stardom in the 80s, and who tries to cope with both her professional and personal lives.  Mariah may not always score in the dramatic scenes, but she has a charming quality that carries the picture nonetheless, particularly in her scenes with Max Beesly, who plays her boyfriend.  Glitter is not perfect; it's episodic, the music is okay  and the climactic scenes
(involving a dramatic concert finale) are not believeable (you'll know what I mean when you see it), yet it is still enjoyable.  The film works best when it is poking fun at the 80s and at the
superficial nature of the music business (since Mariah is the star and helped oversee the project, this heightens the comedy and thus, makes it realistic), it's only too bad the film didn't concentrate more on the satire element rather than the romance.
Glitter may not sparkle, but it does have its' bright spots.",1009411200,10,1585,4.494773519163763

1661586,2,B00005TNER,"Mariah Carey is one of the most successful artists of a generation but she should've thought out her forray into
feature films better.
 ""Glitter"" was a film that Mariah had mentioned intrest in
making for years. It was sort of autobiographical(a lonely city girl with a soaring voice,becomes a superstar and all sorts of drama follow) but ultimatly,dealt with two of Mariah favorite things:emotion and '80s club/soul music.

That looks good on paper but making it happen would be harder.
Telling the story of Billie,a young girl with a troubled family
(addict mom,deadbeat dad) who gets adopted and starts singing in
dance clubs and meets the man of her dreams,Dice(played by Max Beesly)only to become a star. But emotional shortcomings still
remain.

Just another ""Star Is Born"",you're probably thinking.
No,
actually,Mariah's inspiration was Prince's 1984 classic ""Purple
Rain"".
In fact,""Glitter"" is basically a Mariah-fied ""Purple Rain"".
Family problems,coping with stardom,and a crazy affilate
(the underated Morris day in ""Purple Rain"";Da Brat in ""Glitter"")
were all staples of ""Purple Rain"" and of ""Glitter"" too.

So what's the problem with ""Glitter"" then?

It has to Mariah's limited emotionally range as an actress.
Watching this film,I just see Mariah not Billie. She doesn't give
the character any identity of her own. And the film has a stale
air to it. Nothing fresh or exciting. Or at least,not much.
 ""Glitter"" didn't deserve the backlash it got. It wasn't
that horrid. But it doesn't muster up much praise either.",1008633600,6,1528,5.241803278688525

1661588,3,B00005TNER,"Before ripping all over Mariah, let's be gentle because this is her first movie.  Most people's first movies are not that great -even great stars had to start somewhere.  The difference is that Mariah comes into the movie with a prior history of being a pop diva, and so everyone expects so much.  Give her a little room.  While this movie is not that great, only a few things would have to change to make it great.
First, the lines would have to be rewritten to tap into a deeper human condition or struggle -- more than just a yearning to be pop star but rather a deep desire to be heard.
Second, lose the romance.  Although romance is a classic theme in almost any movie, it doesn't belong here.  What's needed is a musical struggle between two career paths that if she doesn't choose one soon, she will have nothing.  The two choices are: big star go for broke, or moderately successful career in something else.  It cannot be big star or nothing because obviously when given the choice of nothing anyone will take the route of being a big star since there was nothing to lose.",1007769600,,1081,4.424242424242424

In my opinion, she absolutely rocked, the music was so fitting, and the her outfits were incredibly ravishing.  She worked each and every scene, and basically let you haters ""Have IT!""  Glitter was definitely a breakthrough movie for her, cause many of my friends who don't personally like her, really enjoyed the movie, and actually made an effort to watch it again with me, ""She was actually pretty damn good"" is what they told me, they said the script was kind of dull - which I personally didn't care about cause I was in tears throughout the whole damn thing - but she is actually a very good actress.

If people would give this movie a chance...I know they would like it.  It was actually a lot sadder than I expected but nevertheless great.  Also, it REALLY makes the Glitter album a lot more meaningful in a good way.....

I know she is not like this all of a sudden actoress, duh, she needs time to grow just as she has with singing. I wish people would atleast give it a chance. I guess a lot of people didn't like the plot of the movie, but it's not supposed to be this movie that just blows your mind a way, it was a cute little movie to start her acting off, ya know. I mean as she grows the movies will be more deeper and different concepts as well. I think the movie and her acting were great, i just think they rushed the begining, like can u sing, sure, of course, wat a good voice. I didn't like that part, and i think they could've expanded on Rapheal's(eric benet) character a little more. Otherwise the movie is great, i loved it! Also i think this movie wasn't supposed to be like titanic or serendidpity or any huge movie, i just think it's a starting point, it's a cute little movie! Also i believe people were expecting a movie like whitney houston's ""The Bodyguard"". It was a huge success. I think this way, mariah is mariah, she is not whitney, and wat she does and likes is not wat everyone else may like. I know she loved doing the movie and she enjoyed making it, but too many bad things surrounded the film and soundtrack. Personally, the movie was ten times better then the stupid critics have to say.

You hear her songs from the Glitter soundtrack play through-out the movie. I am a big Mariah fan, but I am also a big movie fan, so I have to be honest with you! Mariah is a natural-born actress in this movie, but the script is just absolutely horrible. The first half of the movie goes really fast...for example...(Wanna be a star, ok, wanna let me produce you,ok) I didn't like that part. The second half of the movie gets really dramatic and sad and I enjoy this part, because it shows that Mariah can act. Her performance in this movie is no better than Jennifer Lopez in any other movie, people just didn't wanna see it cause they thought it was about her...which it is not!

1661609,2,B00005TNER,"In Japan too, this film was released in theaters, and considering it was withdrawn in 2 weeks, the reception on the audience's side was, at best, lukewarm...
As I am not a Mariah Carey fan, my interest was only this: Can I enjoy watching this film as a whole?  The result was, my realization that sometimes critics and I can agree.
Probably, Mariah Carey is not responsible for choosing the wrong materials for the film; playing a singer is not a bad idea, if you get a strong support from somewhere else.  Look at, for example...
So, what is wrong with the film? The lack of good script is one reason; so many things are put into the film.  So the pace of the film is too fast, and sometimes suddenly stops to showcase her singing.  This, however, should be still OK, but there was a serious moment concerning alcohol and lost mother.  The film suffers at his moment because, somehow, we cannot dissociate the real Mariah from the character she is playing.  I know the film is a fiction, but I could not help thinking, ""Did she (Mariah) really experience these things?"" As you know, these serious scenes should be suitable in films like ""Tina,"" but they are hardly desirable alongside Mariah's persona.  That is why the last scene (which tries to wring tears from us) fails, because we KNOW she is just playing the part.
I don't think this is a vanity product, but still a result of misguided judgment.  Why not strong supporting cast? (Eric Benet appears, giving a good, but too brief support.)  Why not another director?  Vondie Curtis-Hall, known as director of ""Glidlock'd,"" though I liked the film itself, hardly is a right choice.  I hope her next film would be a better one.",1004313600,,1682,4.591973244147157

Everyone is right...Mariah is a wonderful singer and a wonderful newly-hatched actress, with great potential.
I am also very sad to notice that After only having been out for a little after three weeks, Glitter is only in ONE theater now. I am very upset that others put down her movie, just because they might not like Mariah herself(I can't see why). Even if they didn't like HER, they should see beyond that and see her as an actress, as Billie.

1661611,5,B00005TNER,"Ok.  I already saw the results of the box office and I know ""Glitter"" did not crack the top 10 movies making only a marginal 2.5 million dollars on it's first weekend.  I think this was mainly due to two factors:  1. America:A tribute to heroes and 2. Harsh reviews by movie critics.  ""America: A tribute to heroes"" was such a high grosser it probably kept many people away from the theaters on Friday night, the night of the debut.  Critics rated ""glitter"" surpirsingly low and maybe discouraged would-be movie goers to see this film.  I did see this film on it's first day of release and let me tell you:  don't believe the critics.  Ok, I will tell you that yes I am a huge fan of Mariah Carey but that really shouldn't affect this review at all.  Mariah has really great acting ability in this very moving and touching film.  It's basically her first film debut other than ""The Bachelor"" which she did a cameo.  The film is basically about Billie Frank (Mariah) growing up in a poor neighborhood with a drug addict mother and a torn apart family.  Billie grows up to become a back-up singer in an all girl group where her voice becomes more noticible than the lead singer herself.  She eventually becomes a star through a bad boy DJ (Max Beesley) who has a big dispute with her former manager over her contract.  He is ordered to pay 100 thousand to contract Billie but he never pays the money.  It's a really touching movie and shows the struggle of Billie trying to do music and trying to make a name of herself dispite people saying ""her music sounds the same"" or similar comments.  Billie struggles with the loss of her mother and hopes one day they will re-unite.  Billie also falls in love with DJ Dice but they have problems in their relationship later on.  I think the storyline is really great.  There is lots of great music by Mariah and when she sings ""Never Too Far"" live, it's just amazing.  This movie touched my emotions because it was really sad at times, happy at other times and very funny.  Mariah has excellent acting talent and this could be her second best talent to singing!  There were some unintentional laughs by the audience I saw this movie with and it was weird cause some people were laughing during parts of the movie that were not even funny at all and I coudln't understand it.  They just thought it was hilarious she loved her cat so much I guess.  Mariah Fans, you will love this movie just like I did.  Mariah is truly a talented actress and don't mind the critics.  They don't know what a good movie is anyway.  I'm sure ""Wisegirls"" will get Mariah even more noticed by Hollywood and she'll develop into an even better actress.  People who don't know what to expect, I encourage you to see this movie because I'm sure you will at least like it.  It's a good date movie too.  Very sad though at parts.  Overall, I loved it and Mariah still rules my world.",1001894400,5,2895,4.426136363636363
1661612,4,B00005TNER,"I'm a big Mariah Carey fan so naturally I had to check out her acting skills in GLITTER. First of all, the critics are totally wrong! GLITTER is an enjoyable, light movie to watch. Mariah does OK on her first try as an actress. I admit, some scenes are a bit cheesy but it's not THAT bad. GLITTER begins with flashbacks of Billie's (Mariah's Character) past as a child with her mom. Her mom is a struggling singer that performs at bars/clubs. Soon after Billie's mom puts her in a foster home. Then, GLITTER fast forwards to 1983 in the club scene. Billie is now a young woman working at the club as a dancer. Anyways, to make a long story short she gets discovered by this guy (Dice) and he becomes her boyfriend/mananger. Billie now tries to make it as a singer in the 80's. GLITTER also features appearances by Da Brat and Eric Benet.",1001635200,,837,4.371794871794871
1661613,5,B00005TNER,"OH, GET THE TISSUES READY! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A WHILE. MARIAH WAS OK, BUT THE STORY-LINE WAS EXCELLENT!  ROXCKSTAR HAS NOTHING ON THE RAGS TO RICHES TALE OF CAREY'S CHARACTER. THIS WAS AWESOME AND I CAN CRY JUST THINKING OF THE MOVIE. GREAT FOR  A DATE OR TO SEE WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS, GUYS WILL LOVE IT TOO!",1001635200,,337,4.014925373134329
1661614,5,B00005TNER,"Me and my friend went to go see Glitter the day after it came out which was last weekend.  OOh it was an awesome movie and Mariah Carey can act for all you people who said she couldn't act.  She did a good a job, with directing and acting.  Billie(Mariah) and Julian ""Dice"" Black (Max) made a great couple in this movie.  I think they would make a great couple offscreen also.  Max is so hot!!!  I just wanna tell Mariah to go on with  her acting, you could really make it with singing and acting.  Brat and Tia did an awesome job as her best friends!!  I cried when she cried especially when she touched me at her concert in the movie by saying ""Don't ever take someone for granted, because you never know when you will lose them!""  I just wanna say ""I thought that was really deep Mariah!""  It would mean the world to me if Mariah had a concert in North Carolina and I could meet her and maybe get a couple of tickets and backstage passes.  That would really mean the world to me, and I wish I could meet Max Beesley because I really think he is gorgeous and I love his accent.  Anyway I think what happens in the end to Dice.  If you haven't seen the movie then I won't tell what happens to Dice, but I really recommend that you girls take a couple of your friends, and guys take your girlfriend to this movie, and everyone don't take anyone for granted because you don't know when you will lose them!

1661625,5,B00005TNER,"Glitter was released on Friday the 21st, by Sunday the 23rd I had seen it 3 times.  This movie is worth the price of admission, I would pay $15 a ticket to see it.  The movie has its funny parts, thanks to Da'Brat and Tia, and its emotional parts.  Overall everyone in this movie was great, but Mariah out shined them all. In her first starring role I think MC did one heck of a job.  I can't wait for her other movie ""Wisegirls"" to come out next year. If you haven't seen this movie, go see it, I guarentee you will love it. Mariah is soaring to the top of the actress list.",1001376000,3,575,4.017543859649122
1661626,5,B00005TNER,"I saw this movie a couple of days ago, after anicipating to see it for months. I just recently got a Mariah Carey CD and it is the only thing I listen to now. So when Glitter came out, I wanted to see if Mariah could act and sing. Don't get me wrong, I love Mariah, I think she is great, but I had my doubts about her acting. She was way better than I expected. I took my little sister to the movie, and she hates Mariah Carey, but when it was over, she loved it.
  The music in the movie was perfect. It was all perfect 80's sound. If you don't like Mariah Carey or whatever, you should see the movie anyway just to hear the songs. The directing was great too, the director made sure that everything was authentic (i.e. 80's clothes, style, attitude) All and all, this was a really good movie, it was way better than I expected, even though it has gotten bad reviews, this is not one of them.",1001289600,3,893,4.068181818181818
1661627,4,B00005TNER,"I watched Glitter this weekend.  Upon entering the theater there was a part of me that was afraid of what I would see - a horrible film, bad acting, and the demise of Mariah's acting career.  As I looked around I noticed there were only a handfull of people in the theater so I immediately knew that this movie was not going to be the commercial success that a lot of people were hoping for (it's only at number 11 this week).  I liked the movie a lot.  The movie has no socially redeeming value, but that's not the point of it.  It's meant to be pure entertainment and Mariah definitely delivers.  It's a fun movie with a great storyline.  There were a few scenes that were emotional and touching and Mariah's music scores the movie well.  Her acting skills, though not bad, do need a little work, but this is her first movie so give her a break.  She is definitely a capable actress and I'm now eagerly anticipating her next movie: Wisegirls.",1001289600,3,944,4.379310344827586
1661628,4,B00005TNER,"I am not a fan of Mariah Carey. I think she is a great singer who under uses her voice alot with terrible songs and even more terrible music videos. I loved this movie though. Go into this ""Pop Film"" with no expectations and enjoy the fun ride. It made me laugh, yell at the screen and cry. Mariah Carey may not make music I agree with or music videos that I would vote for on TRL, but the fact remains that she is a great talent.",1001289600,,430,3.954022988505747
1661629,1,B00005TNER,"There's a standard joke about movie trailers that nonetheless rings true--if the narrator solemnly begins, ""In a world ..."" the movie is going to be lousy.  When I first saw the trailer for Mariah Carey's ""Glitter"" and heard those fateful words, the knell of doom sounded in my mind.
Still, when someone offered me a free ticket for a sneak preview I could not resist.  If nothing else, it would be good for a few laughs, I thought.
But no.  ""Glitter"" takes itself deadly seriously, as does Mariah, and that turns what could have been a so-bad-it's-funny film into 100 minutes of tedium and eye-rolling.
The plot, as it usually is for recording artists' vanity vehicles, is simple--Mariah plays Billie Frank, a poor kid from the other side of the tracks (alcoholic mother, absent father, blah, blah, blah) who ascends to divahood with the help of her dj/producer (Max Beesley), who then grows jealous of her success.  Anyone who has seen ""A Star Is Born"" (or ""One Trick Pony"" for that matter) will know exactly how the film turns out.  It roughly follows the path of Mariah's own success, complete with mean Tommy Mottola and Brenda K. Starr clones (FYI, Mariah got a start singing backup for Brenda).
What makes the film ultimately ludicrous is that it is purported to take place in the mid-eighties, but the look, slang and fashions are straight outta ""TRL,"" since these days the majority of Mariah's fans weren't even born when Reagan was president.  Why this particular time frame was chosen is a mystery.  Anyone over the age of 25 who sees this film will have a great deal of fun marveling at what we were supposedly wearing and listening to back then (dreadlocks?  rapping?  In 1983 we were wearing color-coordinated flouncy miniskirt sets and listening to Duran Duran in the clubs!).  And Billie's supposedly self-penned 1983 hit, ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On,"" was a Robert Palmer song--that came out in 1985!  Videos, with the exception of Michael Jackson, were still pretty much straight performance shots, but nope, there Mariah is in a dreamy dance sequence clad in a silver bikini.
This movie misses on so many levels it's amazing.  At the sneak preview I attended, there were two girls, around 14 or so, sitting in front of my friend and I.  Rabid Mariah fans both, they were bouncing around excitedly when the movie began.  By the end, they were sitting in as much of a daze as the rest of the audience.  As we filed out, one of them said, ""I still love Mariah, but that movie was really bad.""

1661631,5,B00005TNER,"A review is not you opinion.  A review is a judgement on how you think an audience would react to the movie.  No one can honestly say that the movie will be good or not by a trailer.  You have to actually go see the movie.  Mariah Carey is an amateur of course, but you all haven't even given her a shot to at least make her name in the movie world.  It seems to me like everyone in the movie business only needs to look good and be able to read, and Mariah can do both so she has it made in the shade.  Julia Roberts is a terrible actress, but she has a big name.  The trailer for Glitter looks awesome.  I think audiences will enjoy the movie.  It was said to be more of a love story versus about the life of a star.  So, this sets the story of this movie past Whitney's movie, The Bodygaurd, which showed her as a snobbish woman who let fame go to her head, then Fatal Attraction like action got her together with the Bodygaurd.  So, Mariah will make an impression on fans and non-fans.  She won't give up; she hasn't yet.  That shows the extent of her true potential and devotion as a person.  The movie will be a hit.",999302400,2,1122,4.018099547511312
