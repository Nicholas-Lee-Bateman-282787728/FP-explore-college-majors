8604118,5,B00ED1ZYMG,"A wonderful film, Pardon Mon Affaire (Un elephant ca trompe enormement). is very clever, funny, sophisticated, human, all with a touch of pathos in a way that only French cinema seems able to do. The VHS (which was the only version available for a long time) is typical VHS quality, a bit fuzzy compared to DVD or BluRay, but until recently digital copies were virtually impossible to find. Between my ordering 6 weeks ago and now (Ap. 2014), a BluRay edition has become available of Pardon Mon Affaire (Un lphant a trompe normment - An Elephant Can Be Extremely Deceptive). The BluRay indicates it is subtitled  and says the languages are French and English. The DVD now out too, indicates the language as only French, with subtitles. These distinctions are important, and hopefully accurate.

The VHS is dubbed. Initially I was disappointed, being familiar with all the French actors and their voices from other works, and I saw this film on its release, with subtitles. But then... the dialogue, especially of characters in the background, speaking along with the main protagonists on screen at the same time, greatly enrich the complexity of the film, and background conversations are not subtitled. But they are dubbed. What I missed! So without being fluent enough in French and without being able to follow a foreground conversation and a background conversation at the same time, the subtleties only come across in the dubbed version. Who would have thought? It would be lovely to have both options: dubbed and subtitled. Are they both really on the BluRay? I wonder?

Five stars for the story. Three stars for the quality of this VHS. At least four stars for the BluRay  five if it has both spoken languages. Four stars for the DVD with (if) only French spoken. If the price ever comes down and I indulge in a region free player, I will update this review. This French comedy, full of all-too-human touches, is well worth watching, and stands up remarkably well. Martine Sarcey, who plays the supporting role of the clumsy office worker, Esperanza, who mistakenly thinks Jean Rochfort/Etienne is after her, is a particular masterpiece.",1460246400,,2144,4.930747922437673
