5990522,4,B00FFGKN88,"Important story well produced and explained.  Especially interesting for those who ""grew up"" during those times.  Keith Dunavant is outstanding!",1383523200,,144,6.15
5990523,5,B00FFGKN88,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. I'm so happy that these stories have been preserved with this film, especially because they are told by people that were on the frontlines. This will certainly add another layer of significance when visiting Foster Auditorium.

I'm very pleased to have purchased this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone.",1381017600,,353,5.303571428571429
5990524,5,B00FFGKN88,"THREE DAYS AT FOSTER is a must-see documentary for sports fans and non-sports fans alike. It's gripping, fast pace, touching, honest, and smart. Keith Dunnavant is a master storyteller that has tapped into a mostly unknown chapter of the civil rights movement. I look forward to seeing more of his films. This is a documentary that all students of American history should watch.",1380585600,,378,5.015873015873016
5990525,5,B00FFGKN88,"""Three Days at Foster"" is the most comprehensive documentary ever produced on the integration of the University of Alabama athletic program.  I particularly appreciated the recognition that was given to the integration of basketball program, in addition to the football program.  But the film does so much more than just ""provide information"".

Keith Dunnavant has searched out the players, coaches and others who were integral in moving our University forward in this area and has provided them with a platform to tell their stories in their own words.  When watching the film, you look into their faces as you hear their words.  ""Three Days at Foster"" will allow both current and future generations to gain from this experience in ways that just reading about the events could never hope to equal.

When I see white fans wearing a Mark Ingram jersey with pride at an Alabama game, I realize how far we have come and how much we owe to these pioneers, who, thanks to ""Three Days at Foster"", will not be forgotten.",1380412800,,1014,4.832369942196531
5990526,5,B00FFGKN88,"""Three Days at Foster"" is a very well-researched, skillfully presented account of experiences and observations of players, coaches, students, journalists, and others during the integration of University of Alabama sports teams. Even with the broad range and large number of people interviewed in this film, the focus firmly stays on the central figures in the story, the early black athletes. The film is visually pleasing and interesting, it offers many touching and inspiring moments, and suspense builds until the significance of the ""third day"" is revealed--all contributing to drawing me in and holding my close attention from beginning to end.",1380326400,2,649,5.5
5990527,5,B00FFGKN88,"Growing up in Alabama I was close to the turmoil of the 60s when George Wallace took his stand in the schoolhouse door, but still too young to fully understand what came afterwards.  Watching the story of the first African Americans to integrate the athletic department at Alabama was eye opening, even to someone that witnessed it as it happened.  Of course there was not the vast media at that time to tell all of the story.

Three days at Foster was a stirring reminder of those dark days with tales of courage and honor intertwined.  You'll laugh, cry, get angry and proud during a very quick hour and a half.

This is ""the rest of the story"".",1380153600,,647,4.4491525423728815
5990528,5,B00FFGKN88,"This documentary is riveting because 50 years after the fact, we learn new, relevent information about racial issues in Alabama.

We learn coach Paul ""Bear"" Bryant was ahead of the curve integrating his football team at the University of Alabama.

We also see the national myth debunked that the 1970 Alabama-Southern Cal game - featuring USC's black tailback Sam ""Bam"" Cunningham, who literally ran all over Alabama -  had nothing to do with Bryant integrating his team. Bryant's first black recruit, Wilbur Jackson - already on scholarship but ineligible as a freshman - watched the game from the stands. It's a fact of which few Alabama fans are aware.

Keith Dunnanvant's documentary pulls back the curtain to show what was really happening in Alabama athletics during the pinnacle of the civil rights movement.",1380153600,2,815,5.105263157894737
5990529,5,B00FFGKN88,"I have had the opportunity to watch Three Days at Foster and I was sincerely moved by the film. The day that the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed I was on 19th Street @ First Methodist Downtown. I felt the bomb go off. My Dad came to get us out of Sunday School and we went home. I was 7 years old at the time and I had no idea what was happening. As time went on I had the great fortune to be able to become a Student Athletic Trainer for The University of Alabama. When I got to Alabama I had already been shown that people were just people no matter who they were. At Alabama I developed some great friendships from the teams we had during the '70's that still last to this day. Coach Bryant made it very clear that we were a team, period. We were very successful during those days on the football field. We all knew that there were some great people who had come before us to prepare the way for us. Until I saw Three Days at Foster I thought I knew the whole story of integration of Alabama Football. I did not know the whole story. This movie is about much more than Alabama Athletics. This is about how we as a country struggled with a great discourse. It is about some individuals who decided to think outside the lines and who were responsible for themselves. And in being responsible for themselves they helped move a society forward even though the ""society"" never knew their names until now. It is very interesting to me that the individuals who are depicted in this story have been able to be successful in their lives even though they did not play in the NFL like so many people hope they will be able to do to change their circumstance.

Today we have so many young people who hang their hat on the chance that they will be able to ""go to the next level"" when the people who are depicted in this movie are men who decided to do what they needed to do to educate themselves and become successful in life regardless of whether or not they were able to play football somewhere.

Thanks Keith for a great work!",1380067200,2,2026,4.219072164948454
5990530,5,B00FFGKN88,"""Three Days at Foster"" is an emotional, eye-opening film. I saw it during a special screening in my hometown in Georgia, and it moved me greatly. I was a college student at the time most of the events depicted in the film were happening, and like many others, I didn't understand the hardships so many of those people experienced while trying to break down the barriers. I was struck by the nobility and humility of these young men, including Wilbur Jackson, the first black man to play football at Alabama, and their families. I will never watch another Alabama football game without thinking about these incredible men and how they paved the way for the world we know today. I wish that everyone in America could see this film. It truly shows the power of sports to help us see beyond black and white.",1380067200,3,803,4.583333333333333
8615222,5,B00FFGKN88,"I can state unequivocally and from personal experience that if you speak to 100 people about the integration of Alabama football, 1967-71, you will get about 100 different perspectives. I have done this and trust me, there is a big difference: white 'Bama assistant coaches, black 'Bama fans, black 'Tide players, black USC players, West Coast /North vs. Alabama/South, Southern journalists vs. West Coast journalists, whites and blacks, conservatives and liberals, white USC coaches, black USC coaches. What director Keith Dunnavant seems to want EVERYONE to know was that Bear Bryant did not integrate because USC beat his team in 1970 and forced him to do it. This is not what happened. What is less known is that several black walk-ons and other black athletes had begun to integrate at 'Bama prior to 1969-70. Freshman Wilbur Jackson was already recruited on scholarship and in the program when USC came to town. The impact of the 1970 game can be debated forever. It must be stated that Bryant did not intentionally lose or necessarily expect to lose to USC, but I do believe he knew he might and he had a plan if he did, and one thing is for sure; whether by luck or genius, that plan worked. What seems obvious looking back is that USC's victory had a big effect on Alabama fans and alumni, particularly older people. Younger fans seemed ready for change and in fact were already itching for it. This documentary gets into the heart of what was going on campus in the turbulent 1960s. Kudos to great scholarship.",1523059200,,1520,4.783269961977187
