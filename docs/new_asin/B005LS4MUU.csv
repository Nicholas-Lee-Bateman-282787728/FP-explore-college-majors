4829925,5,B005LS4MUU,"I wondered after reading the sole reviewer's rather negative and empty post about how the lack of ""3D"" would affect my viewing, but frankly I was not seeking a ""3D thriller"" and his review made no comment about the content! .  I wasn't seeking a 3D adventure...rather an overview of a journey I'd like to take but may never get there.  But I decided to trust my instincts and ignored the negative bought the film and am glad to report to you that I got exactly what I'd hoped for!....a beautifully filmed presentation of a faraway land. It gave me an overview of its history, culture, music, religion and geography.  I thought it was a sublime ""journey""..exotic and impressive. The only thing that could have made it better would have been to see it on a 25ft high IMAX screen to get a sense of the sweeping landscapes both in the desert, underwater and in the cities, especially in Makkah, but alas my city doesn't have an Imax.
I appreciated the history lesson and background on the Arabian precursor culture, of the Nabateans whose empire at the time was extremely successful by any standards, as providers to the Roman Empire of special spices and frankincense which provided enough capital to build monuments and structures that still awe the observer with their beauty and endurance.
 -- views of their magnificent ruins carved into sandstone in hidden places in the desert was all new information to me-- though the scientific and scholarly history during the ""golden age of Islam"" which sparked the European renaissance of the 15th century was familiar, but overall it was well organized and integrated.
I also enjoyed the underwater sequences in the Red Sea, along with the aspects of the archaelogical excavations ongoing-- Juxtaposed with the unbelievably impressive high-rise and construction boom that has taken place over the last few decades - quite astonishing to see how much of the society has managed to remain steadfast despite these rapid changes of their country over a short period of time.
I especially was interested in the enormous investments their govt has made into higher education and scholarly endeavors at a time the world needs more intellectual pursuit and less militaristic targets.
All in all I'd say the film gave me pretty much what I've come to expect from an IMAX journey film...high quality, thoughtful exposition and a good deal of cultural information as well as the typical types of information a 'travelogue' film tends to offer.  McGillivrey and Freeman rock!  and Helen Mirren's voice polished it nicely.  Hamzah Jamjoon, the film student from DePaul Univ Chicago was adorable & a personable 'guide' during the film making in his homeland.
If you prefer to take the road less traveled you will enjoy this journey.",1324339200,73,2761,4.9375

4829934,5,B005LS4MUU,"Ok, lets start by getting something straight for new 3D viewers.  3D imagery is not all about popping out of your screen, but forming a depth field that goes multiple layers inward as well as sometimes appearing to pop out of your screen. The 3D advertisers stress the ""pop out"" effect to sell the concept so many think 3D is about doing this. This film does have quite a few scenes that is low in depth, but it IS RICH in many scenes that give great depth to the scene. This film does lack in much that actually pop's out of your screen, but the documentary maker wasn't looking to make that type of film. He did a wonderful job giving information and presenting it in a beautiful 3D environment. It is just not the ACTION 3D video that some people have come to expect from Hollywood.",1464998400,7,785,4.340136054421769

4829958,1,B005LS4MUU,"I was looking for some 3D programs on foreign places and this seemed interesting.  While it covered Saudi Arabia, it did not touch on the rest of the Arabian countries.  In fact, it was more propaganda than travelog.  Helen Mirren only narrates about 7 minutes of the show, the rest is by the guy who made it which is not all that good. The wide angle lens used for the IMAX was not cleanly remastered for normal TV screens which resulted in some camel noses that seemed 6 feet long! There are sections on the ""great strides"" made for women which are just fictional pieces as several women are now in Saudi terrorist jail just for driving cars. There are much better pieces out there on the frankincense trade and Mecca.  As a avid reader on the Byzantine Empire (post Roman), I noticed several inaccuracies.  Again, I cannot recommend this to anyone outside of Saudi Arabia or anyone wanting to see a decent 3D film.",1419984000,4,917,4.533333333333333

Very refreshing, even for a student of world culture, with a native guide who has put a great amount of effort in.

4829979,4,B005LS4MUU,"Awesome Hamaza! I really liked this documentary as it unbiasedly unveils the true culture and history of Saudi Arabia. One striking feature about Saudi Arabia is that old and new ways live side by side in an incomparable harmony. In Riyadh, you see tents and skyscrapers, camels and Ferrari. Your documentary encapsulates the main aspects of the culture old and new in 45 min..
I also learned a new thing here... I actually never knew that Nabateans helped develop what we call modern Arabic today. That's just fascinating! I'll definitely do more research on that...
One thing that I disagree with is that wealth is not the ""first thing you need to have a golden age"" though it's an important factor. In my humble opinion, knowledge is the first seed of wealth and civilization, and The Islamic Golden Age from 750-the 16th century is a perfect example.",1361664000,,854,4.816326530612245

4829984,3,B005LS4MUU,"Some of the historical recreations were nicely filmed, HD is generally well done.  Some of the scenes at Mecca were really impressive.  However, I had hoped for something more informative, and the fish-eye lens shots just don't look good for smaller screens (meaning not on a huge IMAX screen).  Both the 3-D and 2-D versions on are on one disc (not a big deal), but the feature is only 46 minutes long, the making of is 26 minutes long, more than half the length of the actual ""feature"".  It really felt like a project by a serious film-school student (not helped by the main narrator being basically that), with some animated aspects that really take you ""out of the experience"".  You find yourself wondering about the production, about why do we need to have fisheye lens shots, animations, shots of the student greeting his brother, etc.  Helen Mirren does not do the majority of the narration.  I don't think the description is terribly misleading, but you do not get anything truly in-depth.  Yes, you see Madain Saleh, but you don't get a terribly thorough history or details about it.  Yes they show the frankincense trade route (another animation, of course).  Some of the shots of cities and landscapes are very nice, but I don't think I would have bought this, even at this price, knowing what I know now.  I'm kind of glad I watched it for the few nuggets of intriguing history about the golden age of Islam, but I wish I could return it and look for something more educational.  Amazon's return policy does not allow for the return of opened ""movies"", that's why I felt I should provide some of this information for others considering the purchase.",1348963200,17,1661,4.689655172413793

But it's not terrible at all in any regards. It doesn't utilize Helen Mirran enough though, instead we get the narratoration from the director himself. Which is ok but not effective overall. The story of the two golden ages of arabia is interesting but the fact that the second golden age was a huge empire that slaughtered millions and forced people to convert to islam is not discussed. It was a great empire though and that is a fact and in that regard it's no worse than most of them.  The scenery is awesome here as you would expect from a imax project and that helps. And I must agree with this flick that saudi arabia is finally moving forward in womens rights , although people who are not muslim still have no rights there. But who knows? at least the saudis are our allies and that's a good thing.  This one however is not one of the strongest of the imax series , but inspite of that it's still worth putting into your 3d collection.
