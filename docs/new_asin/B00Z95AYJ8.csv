Your pregnant wife Linda has been captured by a ruthless scientist, who created a devastating virus. To rescue her, you have to fight through the old rotten experimental clinic, armed to the teeth, one level after another right through the dark, decayed guts of this evil complex. unfortunately you don't have much time, at dawn, the whole area will be eradicated.

This is a really good attempt at doing something completely original, no one has ever attempted a whole feature length first person movie before and its great fun indeed from beginning to end, the story is very much like a game, the character will walk around a speaks like Duke Nukem, spitting out wise cracks left right and centre, picking up weapons as he goes along, the character will read letters and clues lying around telling the story of what has happened, the violence is bloody for most part and looks good, the character movements are great and they have captured the weapon holding movements spot on, its exactly like a cross between Duke Nukem and Rec like the quote on the cover says, there are lots of great dialogue moments taken from classic games and movies, there are a lot of great retro graphic like moments too especially at the beginning with the cool credits and throughout the film you get save games and other in game references, look out for the copy of Doom hidden in one scene, this is really great fun if you love these old style games, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this movie but for a small budget experimental movie is bloody brilliant, well done to all involved! The movie is made in Germany but is in English language.",1456531200,,1637,4.625429553264605
