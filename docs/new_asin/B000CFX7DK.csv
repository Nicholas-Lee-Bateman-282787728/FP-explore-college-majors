2463612,5,B000CFX7DK,Love the blurbs....was the best part of it all. Gift for my husband and he seemed to enjoy it. Great transaction.,1394755200,,113,4.428571428571429
2463613,1,B000CFX7DK,Not recommended. It did not say in large enough print that it was a rerun of the TV series. It was disappointing and terrible. Very amateurish editing. Not even worth returning !!!,1378512000,5,180,4.65625
2463614,2,B000CFX7DK,Not much porn. A waste of money if you want to see some thing like the title suggests. These words are added to fill in the minimum requirement.,1360281600,12,144,4.178571428571429
2463615,1,B000CFX7DK,"do not purchase, do not even think of buying this video. it should be illegal to sell something of such poor quality. not clear, dark copy of movie. if they pay you to see it do not do it.",1356998400,5,188,3.8461538461538463
2463616,4,B000CFX7DK,"The commercials of swinger clubs with phone numbers blanked out (of course they aren't open anymore) are sometimes funny. One is a joke where Al Goldstein tells us what we can do after death. I will admit the best part interviews Bambi Woods from Debbie Does Dallas. If you can find anyplace else where she was ever interviewed in person, than you are the rare one who wouldn't find this worth the price of the whole DVD. Forwardable is the Vera Knotty interview where she peforms the stunt that gave her that name.. yuck!",1306713600,13,522,4.5638297872340425
2463617,5,B000CFX7DK,When stars were . . . Well . . .Kinda average lookn.  LOLz I'm glad I added this one to the colection !,1269820800,3,103,3.4782608695652173
2463618,5,B000CFX7DK,"This was before that dum Republican Ronald Reagan was president for him to push porngraphy down the drane.

This vol. 2 will depend on your ability to stomach Al Goldstein's tactless interview techniques, his brazen politics and his acknowledged perversions. Still when not trying to parley his mind-boggling notoriety into a sexual conquest, Goldstein cracks self-deprecating jokes and speaks with a forthrightness and candor that is rare in any field of business or entertainment.",1141948800,8,482,5.513513513513513
2463619,5,B000CFX7DK,"I must tell you, if you want to see a vintage local New York adult cable show, this volume is for you. Midnight Blue was a leased access program on Manhattan Cable TV's Channel J back in the `70's. Al Goldstein and Alex Bennett hosted the program and to this day, these men are my heroes of New York cable porn, period. The segments in the volume are pure gems and the commercials are out of sight.

I was very disappointed with the first volume, The Deep Throat Collection, because of the annoying factoids popping up on the screen, thus, ruining the entire DVD itself.

I am very happy to report that the pop ups are now an extra. That way you can disable it and finally enjoy the show in the clear. Honestly, New York After Midnight and Blue Underground should redo and reissue the first volume because of that problem.

I am disappointed of the lack of the show open of each segment. Volume 1, The Deep Throat Collection, added the original 1975 - 1976 opens to each of the show segments, but this volume didn't and they should because that was a part of Midnight Blue as well. Remember the ""Late Late Blue?"" I still have the open on tape from 1982.

I hope they will correct it in future sets.

Midnight Blue is a must buy to adult entertainment fans!!!

Something old? Something new? Something very little Midnight Blue...",1138665600,19,1328,4.444444444444445
2463620,5,B000CFX7DK,"Al Goldstein created a great show in ""Midnight Blue."" No matter what you think about Al, he allowed porn stars to be themselves on the air. This show has clips from a variety of his episodes. The highlight of this collection is the interviews with Marilyn Chambers. I always get a kick out of the former Ivory Snow gal.  Annie Sprinkle is also a delight.

But what I find myself more glued to is the ads for various swing clubs and porn theaters plus an escort service. I wouldn't mind sitting through these ads during breaks in Seinfeld. Why doesn't Plato's Retreat advertise during the Superbowl? And who knew strip clubs back then had buffets?

This is essential viewing for anyone who enjoys vintage adult entertainment.",1137801600,16,724,4.73015873015873
