8376097,5,B002OLT716,It's a really intriguing subject and the stories told here are very interesting.  I wish there were more.  There are 3 accounts of cannibalism.  The first is the most interesting to me.  I know there are definitely A LOT more occurances of cannibalism out there and I wish they would do more episodes.,1347926400,,301,4.622641509433962
