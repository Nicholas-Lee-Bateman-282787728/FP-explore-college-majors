1881741,4,B000099T4G,"Bark! is the story of a woman named Lucy (Heather Morgan) who is the midst of a mental breakdown and the only way she communicates is through barking. Lee Tergesen (HBO's Oz) plays her frustrated but very patient husband, Peter, who seeks advice about Lucy from everyone, including the family vet, played by Lisa Kudrow) and a psychiatric resident, played by Vincent D'Onofrio.
Fans of Oz, who've seen Tergesen shine as Tobias Beecher, will be thrilled to see the not-seen-often-enough actor in almost every scene of this film. He *is* the movie. Everything revolves around him and the problem his wife is encountering. And he plays the part brilliantly. Yes, I'm a little biased because he's my favorite actor, but he really does shine here. Peter has to deal with his wife's breakdown, her lack of communication, her very strange and hostile family, taking over her business and do it all without losing his own mind. Tergesen makes us feel for Peter. We ache for him, even when he betrays his wife.
The film itself is weird and has no satisfying conclusion but Lee is amazing to watch and his performance is guaranteed to make you glad you bought this DVD.
Hank Azaria has a small part as Peter's best friend.",1056585600,17,1212,4.748815165876778

Bark was directed by Kasia Adamik and was her first movie that she directed. A man tries to hide the fact that his wife now thinks she is a dog. He goes through turmoil trying to hide it from neighbors, family, friends and her work. Will he stay with the one he loves or give up? Will she remain a dog or be able to cope with the everyday stress of life?

Plot rating

The movie has themes of infidelity, commitment, and psychological trauma. We don't see a plot like this very often and I found it compelling. The husband truly does everything he can to bring his wife back. They did a good job at incorporating how she became a dog and mixes it with stressful life situations, such as, her family, people she deals with everyday,  and her marriage. It would be nice to be able to has a nervous breakdown and just be able to turn into a dog who has not a care in the world and can lay around all day but I'm not that lucky, plus, I can't reach that far to my balls. I give the plot an 8/10.

Actor/Actresses

Lee Tegesen does a great performance playing the torn husband who tries everything to get his wife back, and hiding her breakdown from friends,family, and her job. I haven't seen him in a lot of things but he always makes his roles feel real when he does something. Heather Morgan plays a dog for most of the movie with flashbacks explaining how she became a dog. She does a great job at playing a dog and also with being a neurotic woman. Hank Azaria tries to play the funny committed best-friend who cracks some jokes and tries to find the lighter side of things in this serious situation. Lisa Kudrow plays the nice vet who tries to help Lees character and also plays a love interest. She seems to play the same character in all the things she does which is a little disappointing. I give the plot an 8/10.

DVD Extras

This movie comes from First Look Pictures. The extras are terrible. Only a few trailers for other movies. (Man, I really should start picking DVD's with better extras). It gets a big old 0/10.

Personal Thoughts

This movie does a great job at incorporating family problems, emotional distress, and marriage commitment into the movie. All the actors are very entertaining and bring their own thing into the movie. Although this movie isn't very well known and got a bad rating I would suggest it to people who are fans of psychology or interested in the plot.

All in all this movie is good and gets at 16/30. It's not my favorite movie but nice to watch every once in awhile.",1265500800,,2519,4.3382978723404255
1881743,1,B000099T4G,"I'm very surprised at all the high ratings for this movie. This movie was awful, maybe I'm just not avant-garde enough to get this movie but I was not impressed.

Basically this movie is about a woman who acts like a dog. Seeing her bark was annoying for the neighbors in the movie and for me. I have to admit that I didn't finish this movie, so maybe it gets better but I doubt it.",1252800000,3,382,4.093333333333334
1881744,3,B000099T4G,"Bark is a film that had everything going for it.  Lee Tergesen, Hank Azaria, Lisa Kudrow and Vincent D'Onofrio are all extremely talented actors that do wonderfully with the material they're given.  Some scenes are laugh-out-loud funny.  The premise, a woman beginning to think she's a dog, is original and full of potential to be either humorous or dramatic.

So what went wrong?  Not only was most of the movie not funny or moving, it was banal and pointless.  The over-the-top characters (Lisa Kudrow is a ditzy vet; Vincent D'Onofrio is a psychologist who wishes he could play the harp for a living; Hank Azaria is a rebel who can't keep a job for more than a week; Lee Tergesen is the normal guy who watches the insanity around him with amazement), instead of being interesting, mostly came across as silly and badly thought out.  Scenes meant to show us how crazy life was made little sense and were badly scripted.  The final scenes, obviously meant to be heartwarming, were soppy and rather abrupt.  Plot lines started and then went nowhere, leaving me wondering what happened.

This movie is worth a look if you're a fan of any of the actors.  They all make the most of what they've been given, and each has a scene or two where they rise above the mediocre material.  However, if you're not already a fan, there's not much to recommend about this.",1204156800,2,1357,4.631799163179917
1881745,5,B000099T4G,"Bark was a very funny movie but it was also sad, as the wife was truly sick.  As usual Vincent D'Onofrio did a spectacular job with his part in this movie.  I found it very poignant.",1155340800,3,182,4.027777777777778
1881746,5,B000099T4G,"I was soooooo surprised/impressed by this movie.  A complete pleasant surprise.  I love dogs, therefore, gave it a chance and I'm glad I did.  Once getting through the beginning of the movie (which I thought would be unbelievable or not possible) I was so incredibly moved by it.  Very moving and enjoyable, to say the least..............",1120348800,4,338,4.982142857142857
1881747,5,B000099T4G,"I was so relieved to find this excellent movie. The actors are great, the script a little kooky but very sensitive, and this one hit me in the heart. To me, this movie is about Unconditional Love. The husband realizes that he would rather have a happy ""crazy"" wife than a wife on medication being used as a guinea pig and turned into a zombie. I was moved to tears because I have this kind of love and I am also obsessed with my dogs. I am buying this movie for my husband, my mother and my doctor. I am hoping they will understand and see what I see. GREAT MOVIE...STUPID COVER...EXcellent Acting...A movie that makes you think...and if you do think and see past the extraneous plot directions, you will understand about Unconditional love.",1116288000,12,741,4.496296296296296
1881748,2,B000099T4G,"Sorry 'bout that pun!

It's difficult watching a group of amazingly talented actors try to make something out of this mess of a script.  Unfortunately Heather Morgan, who plays Lucy, wrote the screenplay and didn't do herself any favors.

The premise of a man watching his emotionally delicate wife's mental stability disintegrate to the point of where she recedes into life as a dog holds some promise, but it isn't fully realized here.  Secondary characters, particularly Lisa Kudrow as the veterinarian seem lost at sea.

There is something of the indulgent feel of an actor's improvisatory workshop at work here, a sort of ""let's assemble a group of independently odd characters and place them into a collective situation.""  With all of the characters wildly left of center there is little more than Lee Tergeson's slowly unhinging Peter to draw comparisons with normality to on the whack-o-meter.  Hank Azaria tries, but isn't given any meat to work with and his fairly large amount of screen time feels wasted.  How do you NOT use a talent like Azaria who pretty much livens up anything just by being there.  Evidently, this is how.

Heather Morgan actually makes the most of the role she's given herself and she veers from wildly annoying to earning this viewer's sympathy at her handling by the psychiatric/medical professionals.

Vincent D'Onofrio does manage to add another winner to his aresenal of misfits.  A brief bit with him playing Vivaldi on a harp is the highlight of the film.

Everyone gives there all and you want to route for them - Tergeson most of all - but an earthbound script keeps the entire thing from ever becoming anything special.  Too bad.",1115596800,10,1673,4.907473309608541
1881749,4,B000099T4G,"I enjoyed this movie, but, some my friends thought it got a bit tedious after the concept of the 'madness' of one of the main characters became clear ... Comments like 'she really didn't have to spend much time studying the script', or 'remembering her lines' started to float around the room ..

Of course if you are like me that enjoys character studies .. well thewn you'd rate the film as 4 stras .. otherwise I'd suggest you pass on this one ...",1111363200,2,450,4.357142857142857
1881750,5,B000099T4G,It is an extremely sensitive and original tale. Funny and tragic about the border between normality and every thing else. A very suttle lesson on how to accept the difference. A wonderful cast with an expetionnal Lee Tergesen!!! Watch it!!!,1102291200,2,240,5.025
1881751,4,B000099T4G,"Though a huge Vincent D'Onofrio fan, I had resisted renting this movie because (A)the title, especially the exclamation point and (B) a woman becomes a dog?  Like the play ""Sylvia""?  It just sounded bad.  But it isn't.  The story isn't as goofy as it seems in the blurb, and the acting is really enjoyable.  It really was somewhat sweet how this peculiar woman manages to bring together a sort of family made up of her friends--it made me think about how many of us do the same thing, pulling together others to make a group.  The moments when all of the friends (who don't yet know each other well) are all gathered in this rinky-dink apartment, concerned about a catatonic woman, while getting to know one another are wonderful.
Especially splendid is Vincent D'Onofrio, and it isn't just because he's always brilliant.  His is just a fabulous character, with so much going on and such an empathy for the wounds of others.  At first, all of the characters, especially his, sounded like this acting exercise we used to do where you pick 2 totally unique traits for your characters (like, I'm a blind opera singer, or a Vietnam vet/bumble bee) and then do an improv.  I mean, Vincent's a Psych resident (doctor, not that he lives there) AND a would-be harp player--it sounds too much like the screenwriter was trying to be interesting.  But it works, and some of Vincent's moments are so delicate and--well, I could go on, but realize that I'm not going to convince anyone.  But, the movie is worth a watch and you will enjoy it even if Vincent doesn't make you pant.",1095984000,3,1567,4.620938628158845
7990251,3,B000099T4G,"Indie film is an acquired taste.  Not bad, not great, just something different.",1473638400,,79,5.076923076923077
7990252,1,B000099T4G,"""Bark"" was recommended to me as being an unusual film with a unique premise; those are two traits I admire greatly in contemporary cinema, and while there's no denying this film has an extremely talented cast I found it relentlessly boring, superficial, and shrill. The DVD packaging claims the film is a comedy, but there's nothing funny about it and nothing funny about mental illness in general. The premise is that Lucy (Heather Morgan) is a dog lover and professional pet sitter with serious mental and emotional problems who over the course of the first act begins to think she's a dog. Eventually she communicates by nothing but barks and dog gestures (a particularly groanworthy scene involves her growling at and biting a robber). Her husband Peter (Lee Tergesen) is a complex, brooding man with issues of his own and whose life is crumbling around him. Sounds hilarious, no? The two are surrounded by a cast of misfits, notably veterinarian Darla (Lisa Kudrow) who seeks to analyze what breed of dog Lucy has become and Vincent D'Onofrio as Malcolm, a failed psychology resident and harpist who tries to help the couple. D'Onofrio turns in by far the best and most nuanced performance here, and when he's onscreen the film gets markedly more interesting.

This movie has one joke, the incessant shrill barking, which wears thin very early in the movie (starting right after the soliloquy on shopping cart return strategy in the Von's parking lot) and becomes highly annoying very fast. There's lots of traumatic drama: Lucy in a padded cell, loads of relentless psychobabble, Lucy drugged into a vegetative state, unnecessary family conflict in the form of Lucy's sister Rebecca (Aimee Graham) showing up as a horrible harpy full of vitriol at Peter, movies of people watching dogs barking, eviction from their apartment (due to excessive late night barking, naturally) followed by public soul-rending, etc. Remember: this is a ""comedy"".

I guess the film thinks it can label itself a comedy because there are a couple of lighter moments awkwardly jammed into it that make you scratch your head as to their relevance to the plot: there's a wholly unnecessary romance scene in Peter's kitchen (What? It's a lighthearted romp now?) and Darla has to confess she can't date Sam (an inconsequential character played by the talented Hank Azaria) because he smells like celery salt. I did not make that up. The film features numerous long and uncomfortable scenes of general moodiness and malaise and I found nothing about it palatable in the least. It fails as a comedy because it's patently unfunny, and it fails as drama because it's whiny, overbearing, and annoying. The film has an ambiguous ending of a birthday party that reveals Lucy to still be a dog, which implies even if the marketers were calling this a comedy in the Shakespearian sense of the word, it's still inaccurate.

For extras, the DVD has three trailers including ""Bark"" and subtitles. It also has one of the most appalling and irrelevant DVD covers I have ever seen in my life. I absolutely detested this movie.",1471478400,,3088,4.946050096339114

7990254,5,B000099T4G,"It was a good movie but the barking was shrill and over the top, I almost turned it off. The movie kicks in when Vincent (the resident)enters the movie. All the smiles and laughs were because of he and his interaction with the others. I also believe that the crazy family who stop by are completely unnecessary and only take from the movie, other than the broken dog dish. I can't figure out why he occasionally sees other women barking too besides his wife. A few barks, ok, this hurts your ears. Love Vincent's work as always.",1376092800,,528,4.453608247422681

It was professionally executed. I just found it really dull and it went nowhere. I didn't get it. I can't recomend it at all. It was hard work to watch and went off in 20 minutes on my DVD player.

But what if you were human...and no one understood how a human could be pushed to the brink and become a dog?  This is a one-of-a-kind classic that I enjoyed from start to finish.  Kudos to Lisa Kudrow, Heather Morgan, Lee Tergesen, Vincent D'Onofrio and Hank Azaria.  This is a well-directed/edited profile of being on the brink of a nervous breakdown.
