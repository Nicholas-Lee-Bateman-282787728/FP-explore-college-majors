The images are very nice and have diverse images of different types of water images (some aquarium, some ocean, some rain, etc). The music can be a bit cheezy, but there is also well-recorded audio of the ocean/rain/aquarium noise that you can select instead. I've used this at work to play behind the singers I bring in and it has fabulous effects on the vibe of the room.

This dvd gives you a bunch of fantastic options. I would highly recommend it for someone who wants to have diverse and interesting backgrounds. But if you want to just pop in the video and have 1 image play, this is not the dvd for you.",1124496000,5,710,4.338345864661654
8037873,3,B00063E7L4,"I always used to have fish, but between work, my daughter's activities, and the daily parts of life that keep me busy, I simply don't have time for it these days.  I bought this DVD in the hopes of creating an ambience in my house similar to the one that I had when I kept a fish tank.  Well, there are about 3 good tanks on the DVD.  Now, that's not to say that the other 6 tanks aren't good too, but they're more like windows on a boat to me than fish tanks.  When did you ever see a shark swimming in your tank, but vanish out the other side like Pac-Man?

In the tanks I would classify as good, I found the fish swimming off-screen and random fade effects a little distracting too.  I would have liked the fish to stay within the confines of the picture for an extended period of time.  Also, the default music on the DVD is really annoying.  The ""natural"" bubble sounds were pretty good and about all I would want to listen to on this DVD.

Over all, this is a good DVD and does give a good atmosphere in the house... but it falls short of turning your TV into an aquarium.",1103500800,13,1078,4.071090047393365
