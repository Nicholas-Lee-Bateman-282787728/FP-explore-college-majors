8451116,5,B0050DON1Y,"Appointment in London (1952) also known in the USA as Raiders in the Sky (1953) is a taut, well written and well acted WW2 Bomber Command story. The film accurately portrays the life of a bomber squadron on ""maximum effort"". There are no over the top heroics, but the mood is just right, with a constant tension even in moments of relaxation... the war had become a relentless exercise in mechanized killing with operational crews knowing that the chances of them living to complete a full tour of 30 operations was one in four at best, but they just got on with it.  The footage of night bombing raids and the master bomber techniques it shows is by far the best of any film covering this subject. The Avro Lancasters are magnificent. This is truly an excellent film, far better than ""The Dam Busters"".
The film transfer to DVD for Amazon is excellent and high quality. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1361232000,2,899,4.549382716049383
