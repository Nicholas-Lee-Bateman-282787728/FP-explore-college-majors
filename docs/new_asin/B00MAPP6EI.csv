6566995,2,B00MAPP6EI,"I was actually naive enough to have purchased season one.  Having watched the first episode several days after it actually aired, I was surprised to find that the new policy is to have to pay for the entire season.  I thought that the scenery was appealing, actors at or near their best, but the premise is tired. Also, the story was too dark. I would have preferred to have tried out the second episode to see if any of the characters were worth rooting for, but wasn't given the choice of using a season pass.",1409270400,2,511,4.368421052631579

6567001,1,B00MAPP6EI,"I cannot believe anything this poorly written ever got on BBC America.

This is one  of the poorest written series seen during the 2014 season.  It is so badly written it will make your teeth hurt!

The pilot episode plodded along with no ""dramatic tension"", no apparent plot, poorly defined characters. It seemed to take forever to end. It was a total waste of time.

Don't bother with this Stinkeroo... You have better things to do with your time..",1408838400,6,450,4.6455696202531644

6567015,5,B00MAPP6EI,"This is a slow burn creepfest. Small changes in behavior, changes in tastes in a loved one, odd behavior between two strangers on a beach, people saying things that make no sense.

Pay attention, it's all important.  No you don't know what's going on but eventually you will and everything will make sense. Best part of the show for me was the performance of Millie Bobby Brown (more recently seen in Stranger Things), a young girl who excels at portraying a raging psychopath.

I just ordered the season on blu ray and I'm sad to hear there won't be another.  This show did not get the audience it so richly deserved.",1473811200,,618,4.54054054054054

6567025,3,B00MAPP6EI,I hope it's time to everyone well. This BBC production is quite intriguing. I watched the first episode free. But Prime wants you to pay for each episode or the season after that. I paid for 2 episodes but the show does move rather slowly. I wish prime would offer some of these BBC shows for free. The shows I did pay for were good.,1437955200,2,333,4.138461538461539

6567029,1,B00MAPP6EI,"1. First indicator of a cheap production is that the cover, which only bears a small resemblance to the movie, is the scariest part.
2. Second indicator is the cheap, supposedly scary and way overused, effect of closeups of pupils becoming larger and blacker - used repeatedly that was it.
3. Third, not scary but cheap, effect of sudden appearance of someone in the video frame. A guaranteed audience jumper.
4. Convenient unimaginative plot of some secret (so secret that the script does nothing to explain who and how they came to exist) somehow living a long time by replacing someone.
5. Never really shows or even explains how #4 above takes place or even some elementary school logic behind how it is possible. Forget everything we know about the brain's complexity.
6. Directing consists of lots of jump around scenes (part of not having to logically explain anything) probably meant to keeping the audience from having to think.",1428105600,3,937,4.89937106918239
6567030,5,B00MAPP6EI,We loved this show. When is it coming back on?,1427155200,,46,3.7
6567031,5,B00MAPP6EI,"Wonderfully Dark Drama. The acting is top notch. The story is of Hitchcock-ian proportions. I only hope we will be blessed with a 2nd series of this great story.

This show is based on the book of the same name by Michael Marshall Smith. What I like best about this series is that it is spooky. Not slasher-flick spooky, but suspenseful, clever and chalk full of surprises. I won't go into plot details as I am sure there plenty of reviews that will do so. I only want to convey how much I enjoyed watching this show.",1424649600,,517,4.329896907216495

6567040,1,B00MAPP6EI,"I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews. I watched 2 and a half episodes and then gave up. It's WAY too disjointed and confusing. There's one story line where Mira Sorvino disappears for days and her husband is frantically trying to find her. When she finally shows up, he's like, ""Oh hi hon."" He should have been screaming at her, ""WHERE THE HELL have you been?"" Then there's some weird little girl who's apparently possessed. In addition, James Frain plays a guy who is pretending to be with the FBI, and mainly he's just running around shooting/killing innocent bystanders. There's no real suspense, the plot jumps all over the place, and it's just silly. Avoid this unless you have absolutely nothing else to watch!",1421280000,4,732,4.771653543307087

6567044,2,B00MAPP6EI,"There are 8 episodes to season 1. The first six episodes seem disjointed in that you have no idea as to who these people are and/or what they are doing and why. Episodes 7&8 answers a lot of the questions about what was happening in episodes 1-6. The way season 1 ended I have no idea as to what to expect in season 2, I don't know if they will continue with the original storyline or are they going to go off on some tangent and take the storyline in a new direction. Actually I can't find any information regarding a season 2 for this program.",1420243200,,545,4.150943396226415

6567047,5,B00MAPP6EI,"I am half way through and I love it. The way the series deals with reincarnation brings up an interesting metaphysical topic of discussion I would call soul rape, because that is essentially what is going on here. Mira Sorvino is excellent and so is the man who plays her husband, as well as the actress who plays the little girl. I think the assassin is rather heavy handed though. What I am enjoying is how they are developing the characters bit by bit. Each episode you learn a bit more, but only JUST enough. It is also very, very creepy. I can't help but think of HP Lovecraft's ""The Thing on the Doorstep,"" even though I realize there are a lot of differences. The concept of soul rape is in that story also.

BY THE WAY, I MADE A MISTAKE. I AM REVIEWING THE WHOLE FIRST SEASON.",1419379200,3,784,4.297297297297297

6567050,5,B00MAPP6EI,"I am so glad that I stuck with this show through the first few episodes because it's a masterpiece and a great example of ""world building"" - after watching the show all the way through to the season finale, I had a hard time dissuading myself about the existence of the Qui Reverti. It's unsettling in the best way possible.

The story builds slowly and carefully, leaving the viewer to initially assume that nothing is really happening. By the time you realize that the protagonist's strings are, unbeknownst to him, being pulled by a powerful & malevolent secret society it's too late - you're hooked. A great binge watch for a rainy afternoon.",1417564800,3,646,4.716814159292035
6567051,4,B00MAPP6EI,"A quiet, thoughtful mystery/suspense show with a metaphysical twist. There is gunplay and violence, complicated and interesting characterizations, and an extended contemplation of the nature of the soul, reincarnation, and a subtle form of body snatching. If you liked X-Files, you will like Intruders.",1417564800,14,302,5.886363636363637

I get that Millie Bobby Brown is an actor and she is playng a part, but I cannot watch anything where a child has to deliver such adult dialogue. Whomever even thought up this idea has some issues. Shame on her parents for letting her be in it.
I'm going back to Doctor Who where they know how to do creepy properly.",1417478400,6,485,3.9591836734693877

6567064,5,B00MAPP6EI,"The first episode was somewhat confusing and my husband and I didn't think we were going to like the show. The writers are very clever, however, and they peaked our interest so that we had to watch the second episode. Now that the season is over we are hopeful for a second season and can't wait. Too bad there were only 8 episodes. This show is cast well, and provides a good variety of mystery and suspense. The show comes together with every episode you watch.",1414022400,5,463,4.395348837209302
6567065,5,B00MAPP6EI,"Premise follows a small group of people from a secret society who have learned how, after their deaths, to reemerge and basically repress and overtake the soul of a person with whom they share a body in their next life. This process requires certain rituals and triggers,  which are basically objects seen before death which can cue the dormant soul to return and repress the soul currently inhabiting the body in the next life. This also requires someone to actually ""trigger"" the soul to come forth. These are another part of the society- a group of people known as ""shepards"", as in those who ""Shepard the soul"" to cross into death and eventually back to the living via that soul's trigger item. As an example, one character's trigger is a sand dollar. There's more to it than this and much unfolds over these initial episodes which makes one go back and say, ""ah, now that makes sense"".
 Excellent series . I am hoping it gets the following it deserves so it too is not cancelled like some other shows I enjoyed in recent years.
It has action, mystery,  interesting characters and a plot which to me, is intriguing from the first episode on. Though different in premise, it reminds me of another action/mystery series I loved watching unfold- Zero Hour. It was cancelled by ABC but available on Hulu. Both series delve into rituals/religion,  relics, death, suspense and intrigue- all that manner of fun stuff which leaves you guessing and wanting more.
Check your TV provider's on demand section if you don't want to chance the purchase; I've become such a fan that I can't wait for it ""on demand"" and opt rather to pay for an episode here on Amazon if I miss it's original airing.

6567071,5,B00MAPP6EI,"Let me say this show is not for everyone. Its a supernatural dark thriller that, in essence, the genre itself puts people off. Its also a very hard genre to do right. But, in my opinion, its one of the best shows that attempts it.

What I love about this show:

1. The girl actress. She is actually really good, despite some of the comments on here. I just think some people can't get over the type of roll she must play, and it clouds their judgement. She does an amazing job.

2. Its slow in therm of reveling the plot. YES! it actually makes you pay attention and think. Most people don't like this, but there are a good majority of people who do. I don't want to know everything from the start.

3. Its not slow it the sense that it is directed well and despite the slow plot there is action and you are always on the edge of your seat. The music helps.

What I think needs improvment.

1. A few holes in the plot, its not terrible, but there are a couple and your just like... really... why did he go there, why did he do that. Was it really that easy, that was pretty obvious or you wonder were the writers just lazy.  You know what I'm talking about... ""that was an impressive code,.."" duh!

I'm giving it 5 starts because, like I said, not many shows in the genre do it well. I think, out of its genre, its one of the best, hence it gets 5 stars. If they could fix a few stupid things in the plot then it would be a really good show.",1413158400,,1441,4.049295774647887

6567077,2,B00MAPP6EI,"John Simm (the Master from Doctor Who) is an ex-cop who is now a writer and he's investigating his wife.  The vast majority of the show are closups of him as he tries to do an American accent.  He's also constantly fiddling with images on his phone.  The plot is revealed EXTREMELY slowly from the POV of John Simm's  character, an assassin, and a little girl.  After half a dozen episodes, I can say pretty assuredly that this is not a quality series.

I do have five suggestions for future filmmakers:

1.  No more little kids creepily talking like adults.  Unless the kid is an exceptional actor, this cliche has the opposite of its intended effect
2.  No more numerology.  In this case it's the number 9.  It's been done to death!
3.  No more crazy looking people ranting on the radio.  As a twist, why not have blogger conspiracy theorists.  The guys on Intruders were literally broadcasting from a van down by the river
4.  No more having assassins jump out of the shadows and kill someone when they're about to spill the beans.  It's like disarming a bomb with one second on the timer.  It's artficial and forced and your audience resents you for it.
5.  No more killing pets.  It's become a trend now to show animals being killed to set the mood, or worse, often animals are killed as a joke.  It should be off limits, as well as killing babies or diddling children.  Just don't do it!!

In a nutshell, the series is a guy who sounds weird getting drunk and fiddling with his phone for the 'human element'.  And the plot element involves one of the above hackneyed plot devices.  Is it just me or has the quality of the BBC really sunk lately?

edit:  I thought of a 6th suggestion:
6.  Just because you're allowed to use the ""S"" word, it doesn't mean you have to force it into every conversation.  This is especially true if the lead actor isn't adept at an American accent.  When he says ""sh*t"" to punctuate a sentence, he sounds like those two blonde (Eastern bloc?) foreigners on Family Guy.",1412035200,4,2003,4.45303867403315
6567078,3,B00MAPP6EI,"I only watched the pilot episode and I like the premise and the way the episode develops it.  This structure, so far, does not seem to be a series of complete little stories, each with its own resolution with little new to offer the overarching story.  Events in the pilot outline the mystery which will probably be explored in future episodes by the few characters to survive the pilot's events. My biggest dislike is the overdone music and atmosphere. Those of you who live in the Northwest know that the fog is confined to the outdoors.  It doesn't permeate our hallways as soon as the sun sets.  Ridley Scott is the master of this technique, but we don't live in a Blade Runner world or a spaceship infested with aliens.

I find the young girl rather talented in her role, but unless the series becomes more cohesive and engaging, I likely will give up on this one. Sometimes the script is embarrassing weak, the editing fragmented. It just appears to be not well conceived or produced.

6567085,3,B00MAPP6EI,"An intriguing new show, its too early to tell if its any good or a bunch of nonsense, but it has kept me watching.  If it goes where they promise (actually explaining the mysteries, etc), it could be a great show.  Watching the little girl perform makes you squirm, and brings up questions about whether or not its even appropriate.  Thankfully she does a pretty good job, but she has to go to some pretty dark places for a 9 year old.",1411084800,4,435,4.280487804878049

The ""secret society"" is made up of people who inhabit other people's bodies in order to be immortal... There are idiot reviewers (some of whom are in the *Amazon top 1000* for reasons that elude me their reviews are so banal.

This show really rides on the performance of the little girl. Her acting is so exceptional I can't remember another actress of her age with her skills or range.

The music is also superb and really sets the tone for the whole show. I really hope they keep up the good work. Keeping the focus on HOW & WHY the secret society does what it does will keep the show interesting. If they spend too much time on badly written scenes where one of the male characters comforts another in a hotel room it will ruin things. KEEP IT EDGY.",1409702400,2,857,4.35
6567097,4,B00MAPP6EI,This show shows a lot of promise but it does expect you to jump in and just go with it. It does have a clear direction that it wants to go which makes me want to see how it continues to develop. Too many shows these days don't seem to get the time to develop before they get canceled and some of that is due to us as an audience being unwilling to give them a chance. I am glad the BBC has green lighted this show and I am willing to stick with it.,1409616000,15,448,3.7263157894736842
6567098,5,B00MAPP6EI,"Very slow in the development of the story line, even if there are only two episodes.  Needs to pick up the pace a bit.  I have to admit I am getting tired of series that are so slow, that things don't get interesting until the end of the season, and then they get cancelled.

6567099,1,B00MAPP6EI,This is one of the worst shows I've ever watched. I'm all for leaving some mystery to the storyline but this show took that to the extreme and was completely incoherent. Definitely don't waste your time with this one.,1409529600,2,217,4.589743589743589
6567100,1,B00MAPP6EI,"Do NOT Pay for This

I don't even know if I'd advise you to watch it if it's free on Prime. Probably the worst piece of you-know-what I've seen in a long time and I paid for it. I feel ripped off.

Why is it that every show Mira Sorvino appears in bombs? Could it be that she's the world's worst actress? What is it with Hollywood nowadays? Pick the cheapest actress? Obviously we don't like her -- God, don't rent this. Don't even watch it for free. It is beyond horrid.",1409443200,,471,4.108695652173913
6567101,3,B00MAPP6EI,"So far I have only watched the first episode. I don't like that it is so confusing. Why do these writers do that? I guess they think it's more intriguing to keep us guessing, but the truth is, unless they make it a LOT clearer in the 2nd episode what the heck is going on.. I'm not willing to invest more time in this series. I'll give it one more episode, but if things don't become a little easier to figure out why this mysterious man feels it is necessary to go around killing innocent people, just to track down some guy named Bill, then I'm done. I get that the little girl and the missing wife have two personalities inside them.. apparently one from this life and one from a different life, but why do they have to die?  Or at least, it appeared that he was ready to kill the little girl until she convinced him that she ""wasn't Marcus"" or whomever, at the time.

8671195,1,B00MAPP6EI,"I have never said ""I feel like I lost time I will never get back again"" in a review, but this is an exception.  I started fast forwarding through episode one -- not a trace of humor or scares, though the completely unnecessary drowning of the cat sequence qualifies as something horrifying, but not in any good sense.  I have a wide range of tolerance for the unknown, and even the most violent scenes if they are somehow part of the whole, but I would hope anyone seeking something along the lines of X-Files would not get fooled like me.
