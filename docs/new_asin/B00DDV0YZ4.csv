5793581,5,B00DDV0YZ4,The best!  I'm Franco-American so I watch this series in French.  It's the best crime series I have ever seen!,1411430400,3,110,4.45
5793582,5,B00DDV0YZ4,"This is truly a riveting French police procedural with complex and sometimes flawed characters in the lead roles. The principals are doing their police and judicial work the best way they can leading to some frustrating obstacles that need to be overcome.....somehow before 'catching the bad guy(s).  If one is looking for shoot-em ups and explosions, this is NOT your glass of wine.. Rarely will you find such a number of great actors in a series. I've been following this series on MHz networks and wondering why we can't have something this good here in the US. The French language and English translation is so easy to get by because Spiral (Engrenages) IS THAT GOOD !!!",1394668800,6,674,4.810344827586207
5793583,5,B00DDV0YZ4,"all four series of this french masterpiece in one package.
very intense watching, engaging plot and performances;  remarkable camera work.",1373328000,8,138,5.9
8592369,5,B00DDV0YZ4,"This is simply one of the best crime tv series I've ever seen the last decade and one of the most brilliant European television productions airing today. ''Engrenages'' is a French word that can be loosely translated as a complex mechanism, and in the series context it refers to the French judicial system from the top ranks till the last patrol officer. All six seasons so far follow a central storyline which involves a grisly crime, mainly homicide or/and rape, and the pursuit of the guilty party from a team of the experienced Paris Homicide Unit. The main characters are Laure (Caroline Proust), the captain of the team, Gillou (Thierry Goddard in a magnificent performance) and Tin-Tin (Fred Bianconi) who, more than often, adopt a convenient interpretation of the legal procedures in order to nail the perpetrator(s). Apart from the Homicide Unit, the series focuses also on the professional and personal lives of a judge, a prosecutor, and a female barrister. The direction and acting are both exceptional and offer the chance for the spectators to learn a bit more about the mean streets of Paris, a metropolis which seems to be always in a flammable situation, facing major problems like drug abuse, extensive street prostitution, aggressive immigrant minorities etc. Actually, sometimes you may feel that you should stop watching ''Engrenages'' for a short while in order to take a breath of clean air, as the depiction of these issues offer no chance of optimism, but on the other hand you can never do that because the plot is so compelling that you are eagerly waiting for more. It is definitely not the usual stuff that the genre offers and you must have a strong stomach to get through the viewing experience, nevertheless, in the end, you realize the brilliance of ''Engrenages'' and wish that in the future we will have the opportunity to see more television productions of the same high-quality standards.",1526860800,,1926,4.96594427244582

8592375,1,B00DDV0YZ4,"Compared to the excellent Scandinavian and British detective series, I thought this one was awful. Totally unrealistic plots. For instance, whoever heard of of detectives removing a burnt body out of a trunk without the medical team and body bags, etc. not to mention dropping it on the ground by accident. Also the overt criminality of lawyers, judges, etc. was ridiculous. Hated it. A waste of money",1432771200,,401,5.0
8592376,5,B00DDV0YZ4,"Excellent series for those who like French police procedural movies. Very well cast and acted, with an attractive heroine dedicated to her job but with her share of problems (bosses unfairly down on her, loyal subordinated who have their own issues, no real luck with guys. Terrific gritty atmosphere.",1422057600,,301,5.163265306122449

The series tho is as realistic and ""true to the real stuff"" as I have seen.  Too bad we can't do a series like this.",1418169600,2,309,3.796875
