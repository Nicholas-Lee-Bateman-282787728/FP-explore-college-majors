Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all
Ooh the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all
Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord
They know not what they've done
'Cause as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all
Ooh the harder they come
The harder",1526947200,,739,3.8366013071895426

Would have been 5 stars, if the Special Features worked, neither of my two different Sony Blu-Ray players would play them (just flashes and then back to the menu). Don't know if that's a Sony issue or a disc issue but will have to try some other players.",1465862400,2,427,4.405063291139241
