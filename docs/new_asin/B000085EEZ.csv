8173564,4,B000085EEZ,"UK/DK... very nostalgic of the life and times, and attitudes of London punks who were living it. Also funny interview with Capt'n Sensible and The Damned crew. It also contains the full music video of The Blitz's ""New Age"" [rare] a track with the most addictive hook & riff of ANY punk song...(IMO) Brill doco.",1334707200,,310,4.654545454545454
8173565,5,B000085EEZ,"An hour of old both life and promo clips,well edited,nice sound and picture and very interesting documentary. Interviews are much longer than in the Punk And DisorderlyDVD,only HALF of the footage is exactly the same as in that one,in tipical Cherry Red scamming style,so don't buy both (P n Dis is better)",1134518400,4,306,4.903846153846154
8173566,3,B000085EEZ,I would say this movie is ok. Some of the speeches in between songs can be annoying but sometimes cool. If you can find it for a cheap price (under 20 bucks) get it.,1120521600,2,165,3.8823529411764706
