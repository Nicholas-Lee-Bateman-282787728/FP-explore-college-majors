It is basically the story of his life growing up in a small town,  why he painted the way he did, who and how he got his inspiration, why and how he became the painter of light.  It contains an all star cast.  In the special features portion there is a great interview with him where he reveals a lot about himself.  It is tragic that he died so young.  This movie is not shown on TV often and for $10.00 on Blu-ray is a must have.  Watching it then watching and hearing the interviews in the special features is a must have for anyone who is a fan of his work...",1513468800,,627,3.968
