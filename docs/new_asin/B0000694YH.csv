7965413,5,B0000694YH,"This disc is quite a bargain with not one but three movies on it.  Will Rogers as ""Judge Priest"" is a real charmer about a long-gone slow paced south.  The second feature is a landmark silent film.  ""Tumbleweeds"" is arguably William S. Hart's finest performance.  The film has a poignant spoken preface with Hart himself saying good-bye to the old west.  The musical soundtrack was specially produced for this 1939 re-release of the 1925 film.  The third feature(titled ""Yellowstone""), while strictly a ""B"" movie, is fun to watch because of the beautiful exteriors actually shot at Yellowstone National Park.  Though out-of-print, this disc is worth seeking out.",1154390400,2,662,5.130841121495327
