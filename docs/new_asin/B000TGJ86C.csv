8209083,1,B000TGJ86C,More like a documentary by some guy walking around NYC. This one will be donated to the library. Or church.,1390521600,,107,4.4
8209084,4,B000TGJ86C,"This was actually more enjoyable than I expected this to be. Maybe it's the years of Real Sex and Spencer Tunick documentaries, but I expected a more hit and miss program. It was actually all hit. A director/photographer goes around trying to get women (or hired actresses) to wear nothing for pictures in his new book, a friend videotapes the shoots in apartments and a few rooftops, etc in New York. Good variety in woman (race and look), and also, anything the lovely Sativa happens to pop up in is a win. Thought I would regret the purchase, wound up loving it.",1339718400,3,565,4.549019607843137
8209085,5,B000TGJ86C,"Just like you would expect from playboy great selection of women and high quality video production. The video is divided into 20-30 minutes clips or episodes. So just when you think the dvd is finished another story starts. At least 2-3 women of color. Lots blondes and good selection of bush and no bush,lol",1320192000,4,308,4.722222222222222
