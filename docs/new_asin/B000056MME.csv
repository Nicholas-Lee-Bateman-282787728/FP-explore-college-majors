This is what it should be here in Finland ;)",1013126400,3,178,3.9722222222222223
7932298,4,B000056MME,"All of the songs are ok. But ""Stoned Raiders"" is missing, it's one of the Cypress Hill's best songs, i wonder why it's not included. If i didn't give it 5 stars, it's because navigation menus are slow. In conlusion, buy it, it's pretty enjoyable.",1012003200,,246,4.488888888888889

This Is Excellent It Starts Off ""Live At The Fillmore"" Those Who Have The Live At The Fillmore Album Will Be Familiar With These Tracks But Will Now Be Able To View 7 Of Them,I Think They Should Have Put The Whole Concert But This Is Enough To Ask For. On This Tape It Has Videos From All Albums From ""Cypress Hill"" It Has Videos For ""The Phunky Feel One"",""How I Could Just Kill A Man"",""Hand On The Pump"",""Real Estate"",""Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk"" And ""Latin Lingo"" From ""Cypress Hill II:Black Sunday"" The Videos Which Appear Are ""When The Ship Goes Down"",""I Ain't Goin' Out Like That"" And ""Insane In The Brain"" The Tracks That Appear From The Album ""Cypress Hill III:Temple Of Boom"" Are ""Illusions"" And ""Throw Your Set In The Air"",From Cypress Hill IV ""Tequila Sunrise"" And ""Dr. Greenthumb"" And From ""Skull & Bones"",""Rock Superstar"" And ""Can't Get The Best Of Me"".You Must Buy This It Even Got Tracks From ""Unreleased And Revamped"",These Are ""Throw Your Hands In The Air"" And ""Boom Biddy Bye Bye(Fugees Remix)"" And A Spanish Version Of ""How I could Just Kill A Man"" From The Spanish Album,Also Features ""Puppet Master"" Featuring Dr. Dre Which Appeared On A Soul Assasins Album. Its Brilliant I'm Tellin' Ya Your Not EVER Going To See Most Of These Videos Anywhere Else,TV Has Been So [...] Stupid Not To Show These Vids Regulary Of The Band That After Ten Years Is ""Still Smokin'"".",995500800,6,1430,4.58984375
7932301,4,B000056MME,"PROS: The music videos are well done and artistic. The DVD has many great hits, and a lot of videos that you most likely have never seen. The TV Special (30 minutes) is pretty interesting. Quality of sound and picture in all tracks (including live) is great.

CONS: Most (if not all) of the music videos have the lyrics edited for profanity. As for the live tracks at the beginning - they don't put on a great show. The live tracks are kind of boring.

Overall, the pros outweigh the minor flaws. This is essential for any Cypress Hill fan. It's a blast to watch over and over, especially with friends - just don't buy it for the live performances; they're dissapointing.",986428800,3,671,4.491803278688525
7932302,5,B000056MME,This is a MUST OWN DVD for a true fan of Cypress Hill. These music videos are nearly impossible to find or download and its awesome with 27 Videos all on one disc. However I gotta say it would have been much better if Cypress had put the whole concert live on a DVD. MUST OWN!,981936000,,276,3.9464285714285716
7932303,4,B000056MME,"This DVD is the best thing Cypress Hill can do for all their fans who have never seen all there videos.  It doesn't contain every Cypress Hill video such as; Rap Superstar, Boom Biddy Bye Bye (original version) and Insane In The Brain (Jason Nevins Remix).  It's probably not a DVD you'll watch over and over, but the rarely seen videos are cool to watch.  Although this contains 7 live performances, they should have included the entire show which would have made for a great DVD. There isn't much else except for the TV special which is cool.  Watch what has made Cypress Hill one of the greatest rap groups today, and see why they are still smokin' after 10 years!!!!",981417600,2,670,4.512396694214876
