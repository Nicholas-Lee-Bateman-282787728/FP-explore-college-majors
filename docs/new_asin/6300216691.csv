262291,4,6300216691,"Super adaption of Hemmingway's novel. The latter third is a bit weak. It amlost feels like Schaffner is trying to take us over into ""To Have and Have Not"".  There is a powerful theme in Thomas Hudson's time in Cuba hunting German submarines and his isolation and despair over the loss of his sons.  It carries well into the emotion of his relentless hunt throughout Cuban waters for the Germans in the novel. This should have been used to finish off the movie. Instead Schaffner switches over into late 50's Cuba??? It weakens the end. Excellent first two thirds, though. The casting of George C. Scott as Hudson is brilliant.  It fits him like a glove. If you didn't like the movie end, PLEASE read the book, Papa H would have wanted you to.",1076198400,4,742,4.522388059701493

262293,4,6300216691,"Ernest Hemingway was the all time master of tales about real men who go  down fighting.  The twist, however, is that so many of his heroes recognize  the futility of their struggle, and in writing them this way Hemingway taps  into something ancient, something epic on the level of Greek  Tragedy.
George C. Scott's performance in this film is perhaps his  greatest, and while the film does lose continuity in its final 3rd,  probably due to overzealous editing, this is a film that is more about the  journey/tale than about the destination/conclusion.  My only regret is that  it isn't yet available on DVD, to put its tropic vision and hauntingly  surreal quality on full display.
Islands In the Stream does an especially  good job of capturing the air of general anxiety and uncertainty that  America felt during the time leading up to World War II, and the story  parallels this impending tragedy by building a growing sense of all that is  lost as a family, nation and world reel toward war.  In this sense, the  movie can be compared to the novel ""Alas Babylon"" in its ability  to capture an apocalyptic danger held ever closely and uncertainly at hand.  Deeply moving.",968112000,20,1176,4.7611940298507465

I buy George Scott movies just because he is the lead. He is always great, but he was in some pretty harsh / ugly movies that simply are not palatable. Some very B ones t'boot.

262387,4,6300216691,"After visiting my daughter in Key West and buying The Old Man And The Sea and reading it I bought the book and movie for Islands In The Stream..  I seldom watch a movie more than once but for some reason I have watched this movie more.  There is something ""different"" about it.  It has the look and feel of the ocean - filmed in Hawaii actually not Bimini of the book - plus an varied emotional feel as the main character Thomas Hudson spends time with his sons, his ex wife coming to see him, and other situations with him, his family, and a sometimes drunk entourage.  Sometimes the film is warm and at other times haunting  or tense.  At a high level it gets the main points of the book out but  like any film adaptation of a book there are some noticeable changes.  In this case the changes were OK (I ding the rating one star for some of these) but the overall feel of the flick still made me feel like the book does; one of a very different lifestyle, time, and set of circumstances few of us will see. One might get a taste of such things in the Caribbean, or even Key West, far  from the tourist hordes and tourist traps in the fantasy land by the beaches.  In short a thoughtful movie for a good Friday night or Saturday afternoon with a good, cold drink, just  like you will see in the movie itself.",1495411200,2,1309,4.175298804780876
262388,4,6300216691,"I thought this to be an excellent movie. and I agree with other reviewers here that the character was Hemingway in disguise. George C. Scott's performance was wonderful. Hemingway's writing was based on his life experience; the best kind of fiction, and as I have led a similar life of adventure, he has haunted me until I penned my first and perhaps last novel not too long ago which you can find on Amazon here:

Nice scenery from those days on Kauai too and before it was ""discovered""... when they actually built for real entire sets.  The wharf village was a blank pier and returned to it following filming.  Hollywood !  Sure I'm biased... they paid me @ $250 a day for a week, a small fortune at that time.  As a 25 year old then I was dazzled.

262656,5,6300216691,"One of my all time favorite movies. Great movie if you are an Ernest Hemmingway fan as it is based on one of his last novels and there is a lot in the movie that relates directly and indirectly to Hemmingway himself. So often a great movie or book is a matter of taste or what you are looking for. There are folks who love a good storyline, a good plot. If it is missing, they are disappointed. For myself, what I want in my books or stories are great characters, people who take you on a bit of an emotional roller coaster and characters where you see some development. I also love when various themes are woven through the plot. This is one of those movies. Although the plot is rather simple, there is plenty in the character and theme departments. I really think George C. Scotty did a terrific job in this movie. He is very believable and certainly casts the type of figure that Hemmingway himself always wanted to me (and at times was) but who often feel short. A wonderful added bonus to this film are the gorgeous island settings and historic d&eacute;cor. Well worth the watching.",1428019200,3,1089,4.422885572139304

262660,5,6300216691,"ISLANDS IN THE STREAM, based on the Hemmingway novel, is my favorite film. Why is it my favorite film of all films I have ever seen? There is just something about this character that I like. I liked this film the moment I first saw it when it was released in 1977. George C. Scott is Thomas Hudson. He is an American and is a artist who has left the mainland and lives on an island in the Caribbean circa early 1940. He has several friends that come an go in and out of his isolated world, a world surrounded by the enigmatic veneer he has constructed around himself through his lifetime. His friends include Eddy played by David Hemmings, Joseph played by Julius Harris, Captain Ralph played by Gilbert Roland, Willy played by Richard Evans and Lil played by Susan Tyrrell. George C. Scott's Thomas Hudson seems as though he is somehow playing Hemmingway. He is as much aloof as he is down to earth. He is a man with passions, yet his passions seems to make him such a distant figure and still a man everyone admires and tries to inch just a bit closer to be a part of his worldliness. His friends seem to know him better than he knows himself. I suppose that is why I like this film.",1423699200,3,1185,4.294642857142857

262794,4,6300216691,"This movie is one of my all time favourites. Upon recently watching the beautiful DVD release of the film again I was deeply stirred to tears at its poetic beauty, its passionate view of the sea and its powerful portrait of a flawed man desperately trying to find meaning and leave a legacy. It is a film made with love, that portrays love between people in all its shapes and forms with grace,integrity and genuine heart.

The film opened to mixed and generally ignorant reviews. The problem lies in the way the film slips in its final third. Split into three episodes, the first ""The Boys""is magnificent, deeply felt, honest,subtle and true. The second,""The Woman""is a touching and tragic addendum to the first part. The third, ""The Journey""is where the film falls down. Suddenly we are thrown into almost a different movie, one of an adventure yarn indicative more of Hemmingway's ""To Have and to Have Not'. The characterisation falters and the reasoning behind the central character's choices makes no sense.  It all falls back into place in the final five minutes as he sees his ideal in the sight and feel of his sons and the one wife he truly loved,leaving a glistening,heartfelt finale.

Even with its weaker final third, this remains a marvellous film, one to cherish for generations to come and one that explains Ernest Hemmingway (clearly the inspiration  for the central character) more than any other film.
FOOTNOTE: If anyone reads this and can tell me whatever happened to the wonderful child actor Michael James Wixted who flawlessly captures the moment between childhood and being an adult in this film as the middle son, Davey. His work is flawless. Up till this point, he had been known as a child actor,but one showing all the signs of developing into an interesting adult performer. After this movie he seemed to disappear and no amount of web searching can give any info. Any help, I would love to know. !!",1330387200,4,1928,4.798192771084337

262798,4,6300216691,"Why this film is almost forgotten is beyond me. Maybe it's because it is so very different. This isn't so much a story as it is a series of vignettes that define and enlighten the reclusive, introverted Thomas Hudson (the semi-autobiographical Hemingway counterpart). When the film begins, Hudson (George C. Scott) is living alone in the Bahamas in 1940; he has given up on two marriages and his three sons to indulge his artistic work and his passion for the sea. Through the vignettes, he begins to realize that his life of quiet self-indulgence isn't worth the things he gave up to get it. His awkward reconnection with his sons (and his awkward and tentative attempts at parenting) develops beautifully into some of the most human, warm moments I've ever seen on film. Watch the fishing trip scene, and if your eyes don't mist up -- well, I can't guess what planet you're from. Hudson also learns that he must finally give some long overdue tough love to his troubled, alcoholic friend, Eddie (David Hemmings); he understands that his interactions with others are what it's all about.
Scott is exceptional is this role. Hemmings and Bloom are also solid, as is Julius Ferguson as Joseph.
There are a couple of weak moments in the dialogue and the fishing scene is spoiled for a moment by a flawed effect when the characters and the marlin are in the same shot. Overall, though, these are small quibbles. You will want to watch this every few years and introduce this to others who likely have never heard of it.",1254096000,,1515,4.6992481203007515
262799,4,6300216691,"It is fashionable in some circles to fault this work because it was not finished by Papa before his death.  That seems to me a fair criticism of the novel, which shows clear style breaks and long passages that lack his usual wordsmithery.

The movie, on the other hand, is quite watchable, though by no means a cinematic masterpiece.  As is often the case, it is probably best to consider the film as a thing-in-itself, avoiding constant comparisons with the written word.  George C. Scott is masterful in exactly this kind of role--the tortured, driven soul with a crusty shell and a soft heart.  He brings to a less than fully developed story line sufficient skill to realize the essence of the character he portrays.  David Hemmings is great in the type of role idealized by Peter Lorre a generation before.  The comparison is almost unavoidable.

Islands in the Stream is well worth watching as an exploration of disordered relationships and their tearing impact on the human soul.  It has a sentimental three-hankie conclusion just saved from schmaltziness by the skill of the actors.",1242345600,,1089,4.875
262800,4,6300216691,"It's difficult to critique the 1977 film ""Islands in the Stream."" On one hand, it has moments of stark brilliancy, breathtaking in tone and unforgettable. There are enormous talents at work here, performing with great earnest and intensity. It's a beautiful locale, the sun-drenched waters and beaches of the Bahamas' island of Bimini (though it was filmed in Hawaii). We gaze at these vistas while listening to the haunting strains of Jerry Goldsmith's angelic musical score&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Islands-In-The-Stream-Original-Motion-Picture-Score/dp/B000000O78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Islands In The Stream: Original Motion Picture Score</a>, easily one of the finest of the composer's career.

George C. Scott, in a role he was born to play, is the lonely Thomas Hudson, an expatriate artist who spends his days walking the beaches, sipping rum and gritting his teeth at the madness of an unforgiving world. The film is based on Ernest Hemingway's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Islands-in-the-Stream-A-Novel/dp/0743253426/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Islands in the Stream : A Novel</a>, published posthumously in 1970. Though I have not read the book, it's obvious Hudson is a spicy version of Hemingway himself, and Scott is the perfect presence to take on such a lofty symbol.

Scott's Hudson, a distant man with a history of bad temper and alcohol abuse, is on emotional edge as he prepares for the arrival of his three sons for the summer. The film intimately portrays his heartbreaking attempts at making peace with his boys and forming a bond of deep love with them. These struggles represent the high point of this ambitious film, and scenes on the boat when his most rebellious son fights for hours to reel in a huge fish, is the stuff of engrossing and magic drama. The story takes place in 1940, on the eve of the outbreak of World War II, and rumbles of sea battles can be heard on the horizon, further enhancing the urgency of the drama. The gulf between father and son has rarely been portrayed so well.

""Islands in the Stream"" would have been better served to focus on these universal conflicts during its complete running time. Instead, the film breaks up into roughly three chapters, with the opening third dealing with Hudson's sons. The following two thirds, not without their merits, seesaws between the tragic and the hysterical, creating an intensely uneven film.

Through it all, Scott stands firm, giving an amazingly complex performance and arguably one of the greatest of his career. He's given strong support by David Hemmings as Eddy, his tragic alcoholic assistant. Claire Bloom has a memorable cameo as Hudson's ex-wife and while she does good work, her appearance is about the moment the film unravels.

And so, what to make of ""Islands in the Stream,"" a film that navigates insanely between the sublime and ridiculous? Filmmakers made a poor strategic choice in separating the dramatic thrust into three chapters, and even more so because the opening chapter is the strongest. I suppose we could blame the source material, which was an incomplete book of Hemingway's culled together after his death. I choose to say ""Islands in the Stream"" is a great, unpolished gem. I marvel at the sublime cinematography of Fred J. Koenekamp (which was nominated for an Academy Award). I'll close my eyes and listen to the graceful chords of Goldsmith's brilliant score and then gaze at the incomparable presence of Scott as he strolls the beaches portraying a man very close to him in spirit.

I return to this film often like a warm memory. The opening third is so good, that I forgive the overall imperfection, loving it without reservation.",1230422400,,3766,5.35304054054054
262801,2,6300216691,"I was thinking about purchasing this DVD to add to our collection of best-loved movies.  I hadn't seen it before today, but I've enjoyed Hemingway's novels and George C Scott's performances...so what could go wrong.  Unfortunately much too much.

Perhaps the story Hemingway attempted in this unfinished work is too big for the screen.  With so much ground to cover, the filmmakers choose to eliminate too little and so by spreading their attention a mile wide have fashioned a movie paper thin...

I can only guess that the original script was a lot more appealing than the picture we see.  Otherwise why would Scott choose to do this after his success with Patton, The Hospital and They Might Be Giants.  Nothing was engrossing: not the relationship between Hudson and his buddies on the island, not his relationship with his sons, and not the interaction between Hudson and the only woman he loved.

Completely unsatisfying.

""Islands"" was a waste of time.  Don't waste your money.  I'm happy I borrowed this one from the Library.

Buy one of Scott's other movies...certainly, Patton and The Hospital, but also The Hustler, Strangelove and They Might Be Giants, or another, not yet on DVD, but among my favorites - The Flim-Flam Man.",1220572800,,1236,4.917874396135265

262845,4,6300216691,"Islands in the Stream, Hemingway's posthumously published exercise in romanticised self-loathing about an ageing artist in self-imposed exile in the Bahamas in WW2 coming to terms with his failure as a husband and father and trying to make amends, reunited many of the key talents from Patton - director Franklin J. Schaffner, composer Jerry Goldsmith, cinematographer Fred Koenekamp and star George C. Scott - to almost universal audience indifference, but it's a surprisingly solid and engrossing film that gradually works its way under your skin. The kind of personal project that somehow usually heralds the end of a director's major works and the beginning of his descent into lucrative journeyman work when it fails to find an audience, it does build up a surprising degree of emotional power in the last third. Scott reins it in to good effect here: the scene where he realises the true reason for his ex-wife's visit overcomes the atrocious writing to deliver real suppressed emotional power, while his scene on the beach with Julius Harris where he knows he needs to move on but cannot bring himself to do it is genuinely touching. Aided by a well-cast David Hemmings as his rummy mate and a superb score by Jerry Goldsmith (the composer's favorite) that builds on the sea theme from Papillon and works much better on screen than on CD, it's well worth checking out, although be warned that in the marlin fishing sequence there is one bit of back projection so staggeringly bad you cannot understand why it was allowed to remain in the picture!

262846,2,6300216691,"My opinion of this film is tainted by my familiarity and love for the novel.  The film seems to be an amalgam of ""Islands"" and ""To Have and Have Not"" with an odd Holocaust twist thrown in.  The film may be satisfying to someone unfamiliar with the novel, but if you're expecting a cinematic presentation of Hemingway's last and greatest work you will be sorely disappointed. The film, like the novel is presented in 3 parts.  The first, ""The Boys"" is a faithful but truncated rendition of the book, that is somewhat flat due to the deletion of the family history that makes Hudson's relationship with his sons understandable.  The film does capture a little of the complex and often achingly touching father-son bond which is the great strength of the novel. The second section, ""The Woman"" is poorly done in the film.  The movie includes the ex-wife's visit solely for the purpose of telling us that Tom, the eldest son, is dead, the tragic motivation for Hudson's heroic trip in the third section.  The novel presents, in rich, profane and erotic prose a journey deep within the tortured soul of Tom Hudson and makes a solid, unambiguous connection to the third section.  Hudson volunteers for the hazardous anti-Uboat patrol (not the maudlin rescue of Holocaust refugees inexpicably inserted into the film) because with the deaths of all 3 of his sons and his best friend Eddie, the loss of 2 wives and with an entire world at war, making pretty pictures in isolation on a desert island seems ridiculously irrelevant.  Very little of this comes through in the third act of the film.  Here, elements of ""Have Not"" are thrown in to lend a Hemingwayesqe veneer to what is definitely not a Hemingway plot line.  Tom Hudson would not act out his grief over the loss of his son at the hands of the Germans by passively and accidentally rescuing refugee Jews (as in the film), but by actively hunting down and killing renegade Uboat sailors (as he does in the book).  This is Hemingway, afterall.  To die in this personally meaningful cause is satisfying to Hudson and he can let go of his previously meaningless life with satisfaction.  It would not seem to have been more difficult to tell the tale as it was written.  The film softens Hudson, perhaps to make him more appealing to an audience of mixed gender.  Perhaps Hemingway doesn't transfer well to films intended for general audiences.  It confirms my view that Hemingway was a man who wrote for men and his works cannot be understood by women, as politically incorrect as that opinion may be.",1135814400,7,2548,4.71783295711061
262847,4,6300216691,"After the sonorous triumph that constituted Patton, Franklin Schaffner bet again with George Scott with this nostalgic cinematographic adaptation based on Hemingway 's novel about the decision of a sculptor to retire himself for living with his sons in an island where they will  remain isolated and where obviously will spurt conflicts with his ex wife.",1129075200,,354,5.321428571428571
262848,5,6300216691,"I first saw this movie while based in the Bahamas working for the US Gov't as a contractor, at the time I had a good background with Hemmingway, thanks to a very good literate public education (which seems to be lacking today) that emphasised excellent authors such as Hemmingway, Thoreau, and Cooper.  The movie, an excellent and faithful, but somewhat concised version of the book, follows what I consider Hemmingway's ""self-lament"" on the failings of his life and his desires for what he lost during the course of his full and enriched life-style, mainly, a stable and enriched family life and meaningful marriage.  The book's fictional charecter, Thomas Hudson, mirrors in many ways Ernest Hemmingway's profile and charecterizes his life.  The movie itself, especially if seen in widescreen, has excellent cinematography of the Bahama archielago.  The charecters, although predictable, are not shallow, are identifiable and plausible, and the events and charecterizations based loosely upon factual events and incidents.  The slight underlying political ramifications (such as the jewish immigrants, failures of both Cuba and the US in the immigrations laws, lack of Royal Navy prescence in the Bahamas)are all factual and in itself are generally forgotten when making movies and entertainment media of the time period.  The Thomas Hudson characterization itself is indicative of Hemmingway's own personal ""recklessness"" of spirit and action.",1127174400,2,1446,5.520361990950226
262849,4,6300216691,"Set against the backdrop of the second World War, ""Islands in the Stream"" tells the story of painter Thomas Hudson (George C. Scott in a terrific performance) who has escaped to the Bahamas in hopes of isolating himself from the world. The world still finds him in the form of the storm clouds of war and the visit of his sons from his two marriages. Hudson tries to reconnect with his young sons in particularly his middle boy who habors anger towards being adandoned by his father. The late David Hemmings gives a terrific supporting turn as Eddy a British ex-patriot who works for Hudson and is his closest friend. The veteran and young cast do a terrific job with the economical screenplay by Denne Bart Petitclerc (creator of the old TV show ""Then Came Bronson"")based on Ernest Hemingway's posthumously published novel.

Director Franklin J. Schaffner (""Patton"", ""Papillion"", ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""The War Lord"")was made to direct this material. His lyrical direction helps the cast give transcendant and powerful performances. Scott as usual puts his all into his portrayal of Hudson. The print used here looks exceptionally good.

Paramount has done a exceptionally nice job in transferring this classic film to DVD. While not a perfect transfer, the bright vivid colors and crisp, sharp clear images perfectly capture the lazy ambience of the Bahamas. Although the source material isn't the best novel Hemingway ever wrote it was, perhaps, his most honest. One can detect more than a whiff of autobiography in Hemingway's Hudson and that element is strengthened by Scott's performance.

The film comes sans extras which is a pity (I wish that Paramount would look at the terrific job Warner Home Video has done with some of their smaller cult classics and follow suit)but it does feature a beautiful widescreen transfer of the film.
