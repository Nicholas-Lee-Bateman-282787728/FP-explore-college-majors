2953519,5,B000VU2T8U,"This is an excellent instructional DVD for anyone wanting to learn the basic foundation of poi spinning.  It is marketed to belly dancers because of the veil poi segment, but 90%  of this video is just the breakdown of regular poi moves.  There is a veil poi part, but it builds on moves already learned just with the veil.  In other words, it isn't just for belly dancers or totally focused on belly dancing at all.

She is in front of a mirror, which makes it nice cause you can see the moves from behind also.  And there are loads of slow motion shots that were really useful.

The teacher is a belly dancer and not a professional fire performer, but I liked that more.  She obviously has experience teaching movement because the mirrors are a great idea.  And the pace was perfect and the information was really well presented.  She showed how some dance moves could be combined with the poi moves, which was useful and fun.

There are several really easy tricks mixed in with a lot of tough ones too and that kept it fun and challenging.  The teacher was positive and encouraging and it was a fun and relaxing DVD to watch.

Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn poi.",1189728000,38,1204,4.442922374429224
2953520,1,B000VU2T8U,"I was excited to get this DVD because I'm new to spinning poi, however I found myself getting frustrated with the video. Of course practice makes perfect and I found myself wondering if this DVD was meant for someone who already had some what of an idea of what they where doing. Steps went by too fast for me, even though she was in front of a mirror and I could see what it looked like from all angles. She did not tell you how to ""START"" doing a trick, she was already in the trick formation. I guess what I'm saying is, I felt as I was always seeing step 2 and 3 not step 1, 2 and then 3.

And the bonus footage at the end? What a joke, the quality was extremely poor and fuzzy. All in all the video seemed to be only 15-20 mins long... NOT worth the money, I'm sure there is better beginner videos if you're interested in learning how to spin poi.",1357862400,5,852,4.011764705882353

Michelle is fluid and graceful, and can actually keep her planes even (seriously, some other ""instructors"" out there can't even keep straight planes!).  This would be great for a very new beginner, but doesn't get too detailed.  Over all, not a bad DVD to have in your Poi library.",1299542400,,342,4.666666666666667
2953523,5,B000VU2T8U,"I was totally captivated when I viewd Michele's  belly dance poi video on youtube. I knew then I had to learn poi or at least try. As soon as I received my instructional video, I worked dilligently and have achieved much success. With only a few lessons, I have been able to perform simple routines in performance with my dance troupe. The audience loved it! I am working on perfecting the more intricate moves before I present them to an audience.
 The beauty of poi spinning is captivating to the audience as the veils appear to be ribbons of fluid in the air, and depending on the multi color schemes of fabrics, these can even mimic flames!

 A section on how to make your own poi is included which helped me make my own practice poi with everyday around the house objects such as 2 lyniards and 2 soft bath sponges which eases the occasional misdirected blows to the face and body.

I found this DVD to be of Michelle Joyce's usual excellent standard of presentation, and although known for her bellydance instructional products, this particular DVD would be beneficial to those interested in circus or theatrical performance; dance; or just looking for a different work out video; or just looking for a fun family activity - however, because poi requires a large space to move, you would want to be careful as to where you practice the poi while viewing the instructions - don't do it under your best crystal chandelier!  As the presenter is in front of a studio mirror, you see all angles, plus the slow motion repeats, close-ups and practice drills are excellent, clear and concise, the only difficulty I had with this DVD, is that Ms Joyce chose to present the veil poi section with the veils the same colour palette as the drapes on either side of the mirror, giving the impression that she is twirling the curtains, thereby making this section a little difficult to view in real time.

If you don't have any experience twirling anything or using your wrists, it may be hard to understand. It has a quick segment on selection of poi, several basic movements with regular tempo and slow motion that allows you to follow, a nice demonstration on combining movements and tempos to make things look more interesting, a very quick bit on veil poi, and two performance segments.

I purchased this hoping for veil poi instruction for belly dancers, but there isn't much. Basically you can use the poi veil as double and single veils with lots of spins! I was hoping for a breakdown of which belly dance moves go best with which poi veil moves. She does a bit of demonstrating traveling camels with one poi trick, mayas with another, and maybe one other thing, but otherwise everything is turns, turns, and turns. The performance looks more like poi veil that just happens to be done in a belly dance costume. I was hoping for at least a discussion on how to layer hip movements with poi movements.",1382486400,,1167,4.665048543689321
