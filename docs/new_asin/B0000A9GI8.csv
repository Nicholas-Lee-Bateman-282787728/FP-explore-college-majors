8166167,5,B0000A9GI8,"Excellent documentary about the historic Hill District in the city of Pittsburgh, PA.  WQED did a great job producing this with video and images of the Hill and quality interviews. For anyone who only thinks of the Hill District as a place of low socio-economic status, this film is a must see to acknowledge the vibrant social and cultural richness that existed in the Hill prior to the past several decades.  We show this film to college students learning about poverty and social injustice as an eye-opener.  Great interviews with civic, religious, and cultural leaders including Teenie Harris.  Every Pittsburgher should see this!",1439942400,,634,5.12621359223301
8166168,5,B0000A9GI8,"This is an amazing look at the history of an African American neighborhood in Pittsburgh.  I am shocked and uneasy that WQED (who made this film) is no longer selling it.  All of their other local history programs are still being sold, with some of the older ones, like Wylie Avenue Days, being converted to DVD.  This is the only one of their local history programs that features the history of African Americans in Pittsburgh.",1186531200,6,428,4.68
