7882570,4,6304945000,"This film is a good exposition that shows a group of people who were assigned to film the atomic tests. They created new techniques of filming (including cameras that film 1:1000000 of a second). There is also a surprisingly human aspect to this film and small pieces of comedy such as the cameraman who was told that he was going to stand at ground zero (for a nuclear rocket test) and he thought he better wear a hat. It is a good supplement to ""Trinity and Beyond"" and stands reasonably well in its own right. Well worth looking at.",1000684800,3,535,4.414141414141414
