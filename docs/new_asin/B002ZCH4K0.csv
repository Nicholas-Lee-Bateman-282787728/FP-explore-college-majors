4014321,3,B002ZCH4K0,"Run! Bitch Run! is not for everyone. Need one note that prohibition, even? However, the film works well on three levels and for three potential audiences. Firstly, RBR succeeds as an exploitation flick. Do you want and expect cheap, nasty thrills? Well, you get them. And, you should add RBR to your library. Secondly, RBR is a stylistically beautiful movie. It emulates noted rape-revenge predecessors' images, scenes, and feel. The film-makers have studied Day of the Woman, Last House on the Left, and Ms. 45. The costumes, cinematography, and music all match a by-gone grindhouse film perfectly. RBR's subject matter and plot are exceedingly ugly, but the composition itself far exceeds most works of its type. The film-makers knew what they were doing. Lastly, RBR has unexpected spiritual and psychological subtexts. Unexpected for a ""B-movie."" The victimized character Catherine uses faith to survive her ordeal. Then, pius Catholic Catherine faces ethical questions about taking her brutal revenge. By comparison, DotW visits and considers Christian morality only briefly (45 has of course the Nun character). Psychologically, Catherine proves interesting. She speaks little the entire film, so an audience must read and analyze her. Compliments to lead Cheryl Lyone. Psychologically, her attackers prove fascinating. They are all people whom a viewer has met. A person feels that s/he knows these characters. A viewer has much to consider and discuss after viewing.
A thought on the film's title. The title displays an artful dichotomy. On one hand, the usage of ""bitch"" grabs attention, remains in memory, and indicates the film's exploitive nature. Certain consumers have GOT to see this movie after seeing the title and infamous trailer. On the other hand, the title comes from the attackers' dialogue. They toy with Catherine and sadistically yell ""Run, bitch! Run!"" before chasing her like prey. So, the film's controversial title exemplifies the misogyny condemned within the film. And, one's emotional reaction to ""bitch"" might actually be empathy with enraged and humiliated Catherine. But, of course, one does not more deeply understand the title until having viewed the film.
Certainly, whether a viewer finds RBR ""cool"" or ""well-crafted"" or unexpectedly thought-provoking, the film could catalyze appreciation and discussion.",1262563200,6,2345,5.480662983425415
4014322,4,B002ZCH4K0,"Beating a Dead Horse.

There is a new type of modern grindhouse film that has emerged over the last half decade or so, which I feel is a direct offshoot of the Torture Porn franchises of Saw and Hostle. It seems that these two franchises managed to turn the soil over on a market that has been in hibernation for the past couple of decades. If you would bare with my indulgence a minute, I would at first like to tell you that I have decided to call this new offshoot of film ""Neo Exploitation"" in order to have some sort of readily available label to pin on it during the course of this review. To distictly clarify exactly what kind of animal I am talking about here, I will at first like to tell you what kind of film this is not. Lately, some new shocking French films have come out that clearly have strong eliments of exploitation coursing through their veins, they are Baise Moi, Irreversible, High Tension, Insides, and Martyrs. The major distiction that separates these exploitation films from Neo Exploitation is their professionalism. All the French shockers I have mentioned have real directors, real actors, real screen writers, and real budgets with studio backing involved. If anything, these French shockers seem more like sister offshoots of The Japanese Horror Industry, and not offshoots of Torture Porn. In contrast, The Neo Exploitation films are entirely amateur productions. These films lack professionalism, budgets, acting, adequate film jobs, and usable scripts. The Neo Exploitation films include such un-noteworthy titles as Blood and Sex Nightmare, Live Feed, Defenceless, The Hood Has Eyez, Gutterballs, and Sick Girl, none of which I would feel comfortable recommending to anyone. Oddly, the very act of depicting titillating gratuitous grindhouse material, somehow seems to remove every aspect of sound film making judgement from their subsequent film makers, either that, or it simply removes any and all amateur film makers who might have sound film making sensibilities to begin with.  Now that I took the time to clarify these differences, it is time I tell you about the latest Neo Exploitation shocker to go straight to DVD, this is Jospeph Guzman's Run! Bitch Run!

Shakespeare would never approve.

Right from the very first scene, the viewer is treated to three immediate sex acts, a stabbing death, and implied body dismemberment, all of which takes place within the first seven minutes. The film opens in Lobo's pad, he is the main perpetrator in this feature, and looks the part, manly, muscular, long haired, and slimy. He is receiving fellatio from a hooker named Karla, whom he obviously pimps. Much like those old WB cartoons in which the big bulldog has its tiny ineffectual yapping sidekick, Lobo has a partner named Clinton who is painted as a stuttering insipid simpleton. This bit of character juxtaposition is barrowed directly from David DeFalco's Chaos, which itself was lifted from Wes Craven's Last House on the Left. The big dog always looks bigger when his closest male associate is completely clueless. Clinton likes to spend most of his time smoking dank from a glass bong while watching nunsploitation flicks on the TV. Nonetheless, he is also with a floozie, whos name just happens to be Darla. Very quickly Clinton and Darla are having a shirtless make out session on the living room sofa. Then there is Marla who is upstairs entertaining a fat middle aged John. Yep! Karla, Darla, and Marla, and to make this name game even more silly, Karla is black, Darla is Asian, and Marla is...Actually I don't what the hell her nationality is, but regardless, they still manage to represent three different racial ice cream cone flavors. Now Marla's John wasn't too keen on her lack of love making enthusiasm, so he makes the mistake of calling her a whore. She really doesn't like being called one of those, so she abruptly stabs him to death. Apparently Marla is a loose cannon who kills people at random all the time, so this is nothing out of the ordinary in the Lobo household. While Lobo runs upstairs to investigate the carnage, Karla, his sex partner, helps herself to a bag of his drugs. The only reason she does this is so that she will be murdered ten minutes later in the film, while the main character and fellow victim just happen to be at their doorstep trying to peddle their religious paraphernalia. That is how they end up being captured by the big bad wolf Lobo and his criminal gang. What fallows is a half hour of torment, rape, and cruelty, some of which is actually pretty effective for a super low budget exploitation sleaze fest.

The main character is Christine, who is played by newcomer Cheryl Lyone, and her fellow Catholic schoolgirl victim is Rebecca, played by Playboy centerfold model Christina DeRosa. Cheryl Lyone was a good find for the lead character in this feature, not only because of her more then pleasing figure, but also because she has a rather interesting Mia Farrow, Lynn Lowry, Sissy Spacek thing going on. With pale blonde hair, eyebrows, and eye lashes, milky white skin and huge grey eyes, she conveys purity, repulsion, and dogged determination with realitive ease, and those three acting expression comprise the entire range of what her roll required of her. The biggest boon to this film however, was that of Marla, played by Ivet Corvea. This lady looks deranged, like someone somehow took the creature from Alien and turned it into a human female. She is either Hispanic or half black, has huge long white teeth, both upper and lower set, that manage to show all the way down to the gumline at all times. To make this oddity even more pronounced, she has a very angular protruding jut jaw. She really looks like she will bite you too, because she has the eyes of a complete psychotic. To his credit, director Joseph Guzman was smart enought to leave the captured and terrified Catholic schoolgirls alone with this madwoman for nearly seven straight minutes of screen time. He seemed to know what he had with Ivet Corvea, because he even gave her the very best moments of forced torment that this film had to offer.

About ten minutes later, Catherine is pulled out of the trunk of a car and abandoned in the woods, all so she could be chased down by Lobo as a kind of cruel prerape game. Now on her own for spoiler reason I won't mention, she is finally caught and deflowered by Lobo against a fallen tree trunk. This scene itself last roughly two minutes, and due to the trickery of camera angles, has absolutely no nudity involved in it whatsoever. To be honest, I feel that Joseph Guzman dropped the ball a bit on this scene, because it looked far more like Lobo was merely freak dancing Catherine while they where both still completely dressed. What fallows is a moment that was directly lifted from I Spit On Your Grave. Clinton, the stuttering idiot, is handed a bayonet and ordered by alpha male Lobo to go finish Catherine off, and just like the retarded character Matthew Lucas from I Spit On Your Grave, Clinton can't bring himself to kill her when he has the chance. She manages to get up and stagger away, only to tumble 20 feet or so into the rocks along side a stream bed. Clinton leaves her believing she is dead, though he did manage to strip her completely naked first, which makes for a mighty fine montage of Catherine walking butt naked through the woods while trying to find her way back to the main road. Though Run! Bitch Run! suffers from many of the same ills as the other Neo Exploitation films before it, Joseph Guzman does this genre much better service by barrowing from the past successes of Last House on the Left, and I Spit On Your Grave, and competently depicts a palpable sustained sense of tension and terror throughout the entire half hour that Catherine was in the villains clutches. This easily lifts Run! Bitch Run! to the height of the greatest Neo Exploitation film in existence right now.

The last act of the film is of course centered around Catherines blood thirsty revenge against her attackers. Though there is nothing in Catherine's revenge that comes remotely close to the visceral horror of Camille Keaton's castration of Johnny ( Eron Tabor ) in I Spit On Your Grave, Joseph Guzman still shows enough film making sense to heighten the tension during this sequence by inserting black and white flashbacks of Catherine's rape and humiliation as she drives to exact vengeance on her perpetrators. Another fine touch was Guzman's keen eye to have her dressed in a nurses outfit during this final bloodbath. Having this ultrablonde pale skinned Germanic looking heroine in a white nurses outfit with matching bonnet while displaying an intense look of determination on her rapt face showed that Joseph Guzman had more visual IQ then all the other Neo Exploition film makers before him combined. Though nothing in this last act ever rises to quit the same level of effectiveness to when Catherine was being abused, it still manages to overshadow its contemporaries in this genre.

More Bang For Your Buck!

There are many areas in this film that ultimately compromises its believability, all so that Guzman and company can give you more bang for your buck. First and foremost is the overwhelming amount of female nudity that is inserted into every single crack and crevice that this feature has to offer. Outside of a near 15 minute long nudity hiatus in which the drama of taking Catherine out to country supersedes all other details, female breast continuously pop up like flies all over the place in this feature. I know what your thinking, that this isn't a bad thing, but it does remove a much needed sense of foreplay and teasing, while at the same time subduing the shock value between the contrast of what are meant to be ordinary moments, and those of sexual depravity. The film location was another choice that greatly hindered the believability of the films content. Here we have two Catholic girls living in southern California going door to door to make money for their church, but instead of doing this act of faith in the literally thousands of square miles of suburbs that surround the Las Angeles area, they are instead trying to peddle their trinkets to various hovels in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Sure, the isolation of this location makes the capturing of these innocents a total snap, but I thought the whole idea of trying to sale stuff was to make money, not to go on a tour of lost American ghost towns. Although I absolutely loved the seven minutes that the girls where left alone with mad woman Marla, the plot device that places them with her left a lot to be desired. First off, wouldn't a sicko like Lobo stick around to fully enjoy the nubile charms of these two freshly captured super cute hard bodied teens first before he did anything else? And if he was to leave them to be gaurded by a single person, wouldn't it make sense to bind and gag them first so that they would have no possible way of escaping and screaming for help? And out of all the people to leave the girls with, why would Lobo ever leave them in the hands of Marla? Didn't she just stab a man to death that very morning for little or no reason? And doesn't Marla kill people all the time willy nilly like a pestilence? Marla's hardly a reliable choice in my book. What makes all this even more preposterous is that Lobo decided he needed to leave right that very second so that he can dispose of a dead body, even when he owns a meat freezer. And why did he feel that he had to take Clinton with him? Am I to believe that it takes two grown men to gaurd one dead woman, and one single woman to gaurd to living and unbound women? The point to all this is, is that the simple questions need to be asked by the production first before I am going to award, even an Neo Exploitation sleaze film, five stars. I am still waiting for the day that a Neo Exploitation film maker honestly asks himself, what would a group of criminals really do in this situation? And what would a couple of captured victims really do in that situation? That's all. But at least now, one truly independant Neo Exploitation film exists that I can feel completely comfident and comfortable recommending to other people.

Run! Bitch Run! is the best Neo Exploitation film yet made, and an easy recommendation to anyone with a taste for sleaze.

One film it kept reminding me of was Ms. 45. I agree with other people who commented accordingly. The film borrows shamelessly from Tarantino, which is no suprise either. Most people who reviewed this film here hated the music. I liked it actually because it fit the film and it also fit the music of 70s sleaze cinema. The movie is bad, but it seems to take pride in the fact that it is. Some of the acting was very poor while some was pretty good actually as far as this kind of film goes. I also liked the idea of the ugly duckling catholic school girl transforming into the buxom sulty sex kitten. I wasn't expecting that. Earlier in the film she appears pretty homely while her fellow catholic school girl friend appears far prettier and takes on the naughty, sexy role. I expected that she would be the main subject of the film, but she wasnt. She gets offd fairly early in the film. Once the beast comes out in the ugly one and she lets hair hair down shes pretty attractive in a very unusual way. In the way a female lead would have appeared in one of these sorts of films in the 70s. In some ways this film succeeds more accurately in re-creating a grindhouse feel than films such as Death Proof or Planet Terror, which while very well done don't feel like they are actually from that era of cinema. This one does on the other hand feel like the real thing.

The same terrible direction is used for the sex,it's interesting that a movie with this kind of storyline and subject matter can come across so tame. A few reviewers had the nerve to compare this movie to 70's classics like ""I Spit on your Grave"" well let me be perfectly clear the story may be similar to ""I Spit on your Greave"" but the violence and even the sex are as weak and watered down as it gets.

It is a pure, deranged, off-putting exploitation film, violent, sleazy, and unpleasant to watch as the story unfolds. Basically, the movie is about a young girl's descent into madness after being raped and brutalized by a threesome of perverted nut jobs. The bulk of the film is spent with her getting revenge on the three crazies. There is abundant nudity, and the recurrent themes of anti-religion, Nun-bashing, and lesbianism are all there as in ""Nuns,"" but without any sense of humor or empathy for the main character.

4014367,3,B002ZCH4K0,"A few grindhouse revival flicks have made their way to me recently, and I welcome them with open arms. Not growing up with this particular genre, I missed out on the whole experience. Luckily, thanks to filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and Rob Zombie, a quiet but prevalent resurgence of these trashy and exploitative films has emerged, introducing the nasty to a whole new generation. Run! Bitch Run! is one of these particular films that is an excellent throwback to the tasteless style of the 70s.

The plot follows two Catholic school girls, Rebecca (Christina DeRosa) and Catherine (Cheryl Lyone), going door to door selling bibles in towns seemingly in the middle of nowhere. The girls make a stop in the desolate town of Moseley and stumble upon the wrong house. They wind up at a rundown brothel owned by Lobo (Peter Tahoe), local pimp and drug pusher. Upon witnessing Lobo keeping his pimp hand strong, the girls are held captive and abused to the fullest extent of the word.

There are some disturbing scenes, however like other exploitation flicks the scenes are put there more for shock value and don't hold the same connotation as such movies as 8mm. That is certainly not to say the subject matter presented is not serious, but it is presented in an almost desensitized manner as with many of the film's contemporaries. Needless to say, viewers sensitive to themes of sexual abuse are better off staying clear of this one.

When Rebecca is forced to play Russian roulette by Marla (Ivet Corvea), one of Lobo's prostitutes, things start to take a darker turn in the story. The crew of dirty and misogynistic individuals then proceed to take Catherine out to the woods to have themselves a vicious and disgusting game of predator and prey. From here on out the film turns into a classic revenge tale, giving a nod to the many predecessors of its genre.

The production of this film is great. The film truly looks like it could have came out of the 70s with the sometimes grainy picture, grindhouse music, and rough acting. The third act of the film presents plenty of generous bloodshed as our main character makes an extreme transformation (complete with a nurses outfit). Run! Bitch Run! is almost a textbook exploitation flick. Sure it's not original and lacked in many areas, but I think it achieved what the filmmakers were going for.

For me the film was very entertaining and gave me another firsthand glimpse into the world of grindhouse cinema. It's true that I will not be able to get the same experience as going to a grindhouse movie theater back in the 70s and seeing the classics for the first time, but I still feel that the evolution of filmmaking has allowed these reincarnations of late to bring an experience of their own. This film wasn't done quite as well as the those by the modern masters, but exploitation fans and those looking to get a feel for this gritty and indecent genre will find much to enjoy with this one.

4014368,5,B002ZCH4K0,"It's about time a film captures the true charitable spirit of Catholic youth and their willingness to help others without prejudice. This movie begins with two Catholic school students spreading The Word by delivering bibles door to door in an impoverished neighborhood. At first, all they meet are closed-minded heathens, but they eventually come across a dysfunctional family in need of saving.
Unfortunately, one of the students realizes that she is not up to the task of sacrificing her time for the needy family (it turns out the poor girl has a gambling problem and abandons her school friend in favor of playing roulette). But her more spiritual friend, who is played marvelously by Cheryl Lyone, sticks with the struggling family, even to the point of moving in with them.
A pivotal point in the film comes when Lyone's character accompanies the family on a camping trip. While enjoying the outdoors, Lyone learns that all of her new friends have physical challenges and she becomes concerned about their health. For instance, the younger brother has a speech impediment, the sister has a drug problem and the older brother suffers from hemorrhoids (which are so severe that he often howls in pain). Realizing that poor families, such as her new friends, cannot afford health insurance and the promise of Obamacare is still woefully unfulfilled, Lyone decides to commit herself to becoming a nurse!
We are then treated to many uplifting scenes as Lyone practices her new profession both in hospital settings and on the street. In one touching scene, she comes to the rescue of a homeless man in an alley who has got something stuck in his eye. Lyone doesn't hesitate to help remove the obstruction.
Without giving too much away, Lyone never forgets about her adopted family and eventually helps them too. By the end of the film, the younger brother no longer stutters, the sister gives up drugs forever and the older brother even finds a cure for hemorrhoids.
This is a very uplifting film and I highly recommend it to anyone who cherishes and believes in the power of the human spirit. Be forewarned, however, that there is some nudity, but such brief glimpses of the human anatomy should be expected in a medically-theme movie such as this.

But her more spiritual friend, who is played marvelously by Cheryl Lyone, sticks with the struggling family, even to the point of moving in with them.
A pivotal point in the film comes when Lyone's character accompanies the family on a camping trip. While enjoying the outdoors, Lyone learns that all of her new friends have physical challenges and she becomes concerned about their health. For instance, the younger brother has a speech impediment, the sister has a drug problem and the older brother suffers from hemorrhoids (which are so severe that he often howls in pain). Realizing that poor families, such as her new friends, cannot afford health insurance and the promise of Obamacare is still woefully unfulfilled, Lyone decides to commit herself to becoming a nurse!
We are then treated to many uplifting scenes as Lyone practices her new profession both in hospital settings and on the street. In one touching scene, she comes to the rescue of a homeless man in an alley who has got something stuck in his eye. Lyone doesn't hesitate to help remove the obstruction.
Without giving too much away, Lyone never forgets about her adopted family and eventually helps them too. By the end of the film, the younger brother no longer stutters, the sister gives up drugs forever and the older brother even finds a cure for hemorrhoids.
This is a very uplifting film and I highly recommend it to anyone who cherishes and believes in the power of the human spirit. Be forewarned, however, that there is some nudity, but such brief glimpses of the human anatomy should be expected in a medically-theme movie such as this.

4014373,2,B002ZCH4K0,"This is an interesting film to see, but from the moment it starts you can tell that the only vision here was to hire sexy women so the staff can see them naked!

This film has no real plot.  It is about revenge as we get tortured and learn this about 40 minutes into the film!  During that 40 minutes I had to keep checking my watch hoping that it was about to be over!  It did pick up towards the second half with something that you could follow except for the sexy women getting into all types of homosexual and normal sex acts.  They could not have paid these h.o.e.s that much money to do what they did in this movie!

Speaking of the h.o.e.s., the women do have sexy bodies.  Nice, robust behinds (rare on white women, although I saw one tonight!  Sadly, I was with someone so I could not speak.) and nice joints!  Make no mistake, the women being naked is the sole reason this film was made.  The sleazy producers did not care how old or young the women were as long as they stripped totally naked.  If I were them, I would be ashamed to add this as my 'acting' credit.

This is a porno, not a film.  EACH h.o. in the film should be ashamed of themselves.  Women have to ask themselves some serious questions if they want to act.  The first one should be: ""Why do I have to take my clothes off to get this part?""  As you can see, most women who start off naked on film (Pam Grier) usually end up that way and never get taken seriously.  Just because you are cute and sexy does not mean that some pimp should get you to h.o. for a few dollars - unless that is how you are...

Hey, I like wild films and I even watch po-rn.  I do not respect or like the h.o.e.s. in po-rn and I truly believe that they can do better for themselves than to be prostitutes so that these pimps make money.  So sad.

4014376,5,B002ZCH4K0,"I saw this movie several months ago, and didn't type a review for it then. I am typing a review now because I really liked this throwback to 70's horror, and I wanted to throw my two cents in since it has such a low rating on here.

I'm shocked that Run Bi**h Run has only 2 1/2 stars out of 5 on amazon.com, when in my opinion it's the best rape/revenge film ever made. I enjoyed it more than both Last House on the Lefts and I Spit on Your Grave. It has a real sense of fun about it, a fast pace, colorful and sometimes profane dialogue, as well as in your face violence. Oh, not to mention all the nudity. What more do people want?",1290038400,12,634,3.953125
4014377,1,B002ZCH4K0,"This is a wild movie. Every scene is way over the top. Very low
budget and the acting is poor. It is the basic rape-revenge slasher
flick with plenty of blood and nudity. I give it the one star because
Cheryl Lyone and Christina DeRosa are both quite stunning. Cheryl Lyone
does a decent job with her crazy whacked-out chick stare.",1287273600,4,331,4.442622950819672
4014378,2,B002ZCH4K0,"If I can describe my feelings regarding this movie in one word, it would be ""meh"".  While others may find it shocking at some points, overall I found it a bit too over the top to even illicit much of a response.

The plot is very basic:  Two Catholic school girls are selling Bibles door to door when they witness a murder within a rundown house that happens to be a drug/prostitution den.  The girls are captured, and one is immediately raped and killed while the other is taken to a wooded area and sexually assaulted.  She manages to escape, and then exacts her revenge.

It's a very standard and gruesome rape/revenge plot, although to be frank there is more rape than revenge.  Out of the nearly 90s minutes of video, the revenge part comprises about 20 minutes.  While the content may not be as cringe-inducing as some horror movies, it is still very, very graphic.  Do not watch if you are adverse to nudity, murder, rape, or necrophilia.  Really, just don't.  Personally, I found much of it so over the top that at points it seemed an almost satire of the 70s faux-snuff films.  I'd have stopped watching the first 5 minutes in, but I have to admit, the subpar acting, horrible wanna-be porn music, grainy film and gratuitous violence had a deer-in-the-headlight effect on me.  I continued watching (fast forwarding in many areas) simply because, like a nasty car crash, you just can't look away.

If you're interested in the cinematography, the film is shot on moderate quality film and then filtered to give it a grainy, retro feel.  I have to admit, the director did a good job in this regard.  As far as the shots and angles are concerned, it's competent, but lacks that slick professionalism you'd associate with ""real"" movies.  In this regard it had the feel of a very well directed student film.

If you're expecting a fulfilling movie, skip this.
If you are disturbed by graphic violence and (simulated) sexual assault, skip this.
If you can stomach the questionable content and like laughing at so-so movies a la Mystery Science Theater, then this might work.",1277942400,38,2076,4.6878453038674035
4014379,1,B002ZCH4K0,"I usually like well done revenge movies. I happened to watch this one because it is available on Netflix and the synopsis sounded interesting. Well, this movie is now in the top three of all time worst movies I have ever seen. Actually, I fast forwarded through about 75% of it because it was just unbearable.

I try not to judge what other people may or may not like. If you enjoy absolutely horrible writing and acting, totally over the top gratuitous sex and violence, and characters who don't seem related to the genus homosapien, you may enjoy this movie.

The whole production was a GHASTLY mess from beginning to end. Atrocious acting, run of the mill plot, bad lighting, dialog, makeup, casting and costume design. I knew there was going to be some gore but the rape scenes were down right unnecessary. I should have followed my gut. With a name like ""Run Bitch Run"" what did I expect. Jokes on me for wasting an hour or so out of my life watching this steaming dung heap of a film. Everyone involved in this mess should go play in traffic.",1276992000,3,605,4.315789473684211
4014381,1,B002ZCH4K0,"Once again I fell prey to the early reviews posted here for this atrocious film - when will I learn?? This flick suffers from bad acting, weak script, violence we`ve seen a thousand times done better elsewhere, and characters you actually want to see dead, the sooner the better in fact. And none of the marketing or philosophical reviews here remotely ring true. This flick only appeals to men who really hate women big time - I`m aware that almost all exploitation is misogynistic on one level or another, but this turned me off entirely, and I own a toolshed of exploitation films. The way women are treated is disgusting. In order for a revenge flick to work, you need to know something about the background or have reason to feel for the victim(s), otherwise it`s like reading the obituary column - if you don`t know the deceased, who cares? No effort is made to do this at all, so it fails completely as a revenge film. The only nudity is always tied to extreme violence, so it`s as erotic as giving grandma a spongebath. And none of the women are much to look at either, another failure on parade. My exploitation brethren, I implore you not to make the same mistake I made after reading the first few reviews and product description, there are too many of these films available that ARE worth watching, avoid this one. 'Run! B**ch Run!' from this misogynistic mess right now!!!",1270857600,8,1385,4.611336032388664
4014382,4,B002ZCH4K0,"Oh, it's become okay in the modern age to talk and analyze exploitation films in the same terms as we would approach the classics.  That's fine to a point, but I think it misses the essential point of such films - the filmmakers themselves didn't take them all that seriously, so coating them with the gloss of academic respectability just takes away from the final product.  The more that's written, the less the film works.

Okay, so what is this film?  Put simply, it's I Spit on Your Grave, a simple rape/revenge tale.  Since this is a modern horror film it's a homage of sorts, even down to selecting a lead actress who resembles that poor woman in the aforementioned title.  Now, whether this is a plus of a minus is up to the individual viewer.

The pluses?  Well, of its type it's actually quite good.  Much has been made of this movie looking like a film made in the 70's, but honestly - it doesn't.  That's not a bad thing, though.  It's senseless to try to make a film appear as though it's from the 70's.  Look at Tarrantino, he tried it with Grindhouse, spending more money in making it look aged than the original films cost to produce.  Senseless.

Also, as a homage, it works.  It's tasteless (see the minuses section), mostly without a hint of comedy, and even vicious.  These are what the film clearly sets out to do, so they're pluses - they work.

The minuses?  Well, the main one is - I ask myself, ""What's the point, exactly?""  What's the point of making a homage to I Spit on Your Grave?  Why not simply watch the original film, which ultimately is still more shocking than this film.  Make an exploitation film, yes.  But why mimic one so closely, especially when you don't have a single idea that tops what is shown in the original work?

The thing is, the so-called ""Torture Porn"" epidemic has gone much further than this film portrays.  The likes of Devil's Rejects does nihilism far better than anything here, for instance.

The soundtrack, too, isn't all that convincing.  There are moments when it works, but other times it's clearly a modern work.  Let me state up front, I LOVED the soundtrack, but it took me out of the attempted deception of when this film was made (and if people who loved this don't have John Zorn's The Gift CD, why not?!?!)

To put it simply, this is a decent title for fans of 70's exploitation.  I'm not sure why they bothered to do it, and perhaps if it had been made in the 70's it would be a cult classic.  But the thing is, cult classics BECOME cult classics, they weren't MADE to be cult classics.  As such, I think the filmmakers were stretching here.  As a rape/revenge tale (blah blah blah, yes I know about Virgin Spring) I don't know why you wouldn't just return to ISOYG....  why watch THIS film.....

I don't want to write a negative review.  I give it 4-stars.  It does what it says on the box.  But if you don't have ISOYG, certainly get that first.",1266019200,4,2920,4.431261770244821
