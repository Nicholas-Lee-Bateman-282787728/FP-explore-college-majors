8409940,4,B003VI2J2K,"This film has interesting lead actors and visuals, and a story line that's a cut above average. In more detail, the writing doesn't make use of the full range of which an actress like Marion Cotillard is capable, and there are some technical and believability issues, but in the end you do care about the two main characters.",1483574400,,325,4.620689655172414
8409941,1,B003VI2J2K,"BORING  - old school chivalrous love drama - even that's not relevant, I don't know how to describe it... I guess beyond boring.
The director wasted actors' time as well as mine",1461196800,,177,4.53125

8409947,1,B003VI2J2K,"Don't waste your time on this one, folks, unless super-depressing, no-emotional-payoff movies are your thing.  It is not the love story the preview makes it out to be.

** Spoilers follow*
The two leads spend very little time together until the last 30 minutes of the film.  I just couldn't get past the stupidity of the idea of just wandering straight into the freakin Sahara.  And after watching them meander aimlessly, there is no real resolution for the viewer.",1420243200,5,465,4.848101265822785
8409948,1,B003VI2J2K,"Where do I start? This is such a silly film. Marion Cotillard's character roams the desert without head covering as the sand and sun assault her but the makeup department keeps her looking like she's at a tea salon.  She even endures a sand storm with her eyes and mouth wide open. She is ill informed and belligerent. I suppose this is meant to indicate that she's a strong woman when all she is is a silly romantic risking her life to chase a married man because she LOVES him. She is haughty and spoiled. The captain character is predictably one-dimentional and insipid in every scene. The story is sentimental in the worst sort of way. The characters all live in their own worlds and never truly communicate with each other. This is a foolish, foolish movie.",1416614400,6,762,4.562043795620438
8409949,3,B003VI2J2K,"i adore these two.  i'm sure i'll watch anything they're in together. . . but once, a happy ending... not for reality sake, but for the living, hopeful being inside of us.",1416355200,,171,4.34375
