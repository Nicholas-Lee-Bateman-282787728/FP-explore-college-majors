8139691,5,B000HG6K7Y,"In this DVD Kelly Galloup ties imitations of the most important surface flies there are, cripples and spinners. Trout will often key on injured insects, often to the point of total disregard of healthy duns.

From the anglers perspective it is critical to learn everything possible about tying and fishing these important, but frequently over looked types of insects. Understanding how to design and tie the patterns is a must for the serious fly angler of today. Watch as Kelly ties his revolutionary new cripple pattern as well as caddis cripples and several types of spinners.

Produced and filmed by Jack Dennis, Kelly explains the world of cripples and spinners as he ties the best imitations to match them. Many are his own patterns tied with innovative new techniques to help you match the hatch. Enjoy Kelly's quick wit and tips on how to fish them most effectively.
