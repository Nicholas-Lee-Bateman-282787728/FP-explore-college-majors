7858791,3,6304005164,"Children will most likely enjoy this 2016 animated musical 45 minute film, with lots of singing and dancing, which was made for them, even though the story in it is unlike the classic novel. This film may even cause them to remember the story when they grow older and prompt them to read the novel. The only resemblance to the novel is that there is a hunchback ringing bells at Notre Dame who saves a gypsy. The hunchback is not at all ugly; in fact, he is handsome. Unlike the book, the hunchback loses his deformity and marries the gypsy and the two live happily ever after.",1502582400,,577,4.401869158878505
7858792,1,6304005164,"Morbid curiosity got me here, and trust me the rumors are correct that this is the worst animated rendition of the Hunchback story.  There is nothing done well or correctly here, it's downright comical.  Get some animation buffs and literature enthusiasts together to yell and throw things.",1475366400,,290,5.148936170212766
7858793,1,6304005164,"I got this because I was baked and it looked ridiculous. I was not disappointed. That does not mean it was good, though.

This is the most pathetic attempt at making a dark story PC I've ever seen. It had me in tears it was so hilariously bad.

Perfect for the puritanical Westborough Baptist zealot looking for a nauseatingly vapid movie for their children that has no sexual undertones, no violence, no naughty words, and no...well...logical story line. The music is awful, the plot is non-existent, the villain is comically unbelievable and EEEEEEEvil.",1424736000,3,555,4.956989247311828
7858794,5,6304005164,I liked the story of King Arthur as a child and young man.  It also teaches children non-violence is the right way.,1403827200,,115,4.2272727272727275
7858795,5,6304005164,"I am 18 years old and I still enjoy watching ""Camelot"" as much as I did when I was 10. Great, beautiful, movie. Songs are fabulous.",1337385600,,131,4.076923076923077
7858796,1,6304005164,"Every Saturday morning the Home Shopping Network shows this program.  I don't know why.  Other than fairly entertaining songs, it has no redeeming qualities, other than its lack of quaility is pretty hilarious.  The animation is totally terrible.  My favorite is how every time these three bats talk, they use the same scene.  So even if they say something serious they still laugh afterwards.  They flip it sometimes to confuse you, but they aren't fooling anyone.  Also, there are very few similarities between this and the real Hunchback of Notre Dame story.  Like at the end the hunchback becomes handsome and gets the girl.  You see, he was just hunched over all the time because he was so sad.  I could literally talk for hours about how bad this is.  Having never seen any of the other Enchanted Tales, I don't know how good they are, but if this one is any indication I would recommend staying away from them.  Unless you like to laugh at really bad stuff, then you will probably like it.",994291200,5,996,4.628571428571429
