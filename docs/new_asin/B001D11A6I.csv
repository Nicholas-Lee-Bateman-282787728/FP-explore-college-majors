3521437,4,B001D11A6I,"If you don't mind antiquated animation and hilariously awkward sound effects, then you should definitely consider purchasing the complete Speed Racer box set. I was a fan of the show as a kid and my love for it was renewed after watching the recent live action feature film by the creators of the Matrix. The DVD menu is very clean and easy to use and also includes lots of bits of facts and bonus features. It's a great show for kids and adults alike and it all comes in a nice six disc case.",1233705600,8,493,4.25531914893617

It comes out ""Go Racer, Go racer, veture a heaaaad!"" Too funny!  I have two boys, three if you count Daddy, but their together time has bought me lots of over due solitude.  Daddy is so happy re-living his youth and bonding with his boys, he doesn't even mind changing diapers or cleaning up after their spilled snacks.  It's like, a miracle.

THE CASE IS NOT COOL, very shoddy, looks like the Mach 5 was just in a crash.  The door metal is bent, and not from shipping damage, just a really crappy pressing.  The printing on the wheels is awful.  So much for the collector's case.  Oh well... I can only hope that the crappy version becomes rare or something ;)

Skip this version, I will probably return mine, if I see that there is a better ""run"" on store shelves.",1223510400,10,631,4.333333333333333

1 was made from a real Tire.
2 played Music.
3 was shaped like the Mach 5s steering wheel.
4 came with a pull back car
5 came with a licensed Plate
Now my point is this Why release the whole set again in a fancy case Im sure they made quite a good amount of cash when they first put it out It seems to me they are getting money Hungry like other companies releasing DVDs that already been released

Mach Go GO GO is a far better show and deserves to be on DVD uncut
instead of this children Version.",1223251200,2,583,3.982905982905983

The reason it was so long was because I marked time to run home and watch Speed Racer! Speed Racer was my world and I reveled in his adventures. Watching it again as an adult brought back many fond memories.  Sure, the dialogue and plots are a little hokey by today's sophisticated standards, but Speed Racer still holds up well and my children also enjoy the adventures.

3521476,5,B001D11A6I,"Watching NASCAR will never excite me. Who wants to watch cars drive around an oval track? NASCAR will forever be B-O-R-I-N-G because I grew up watching the death-defying races on the Speed Racer series where cars were routinely bumped off of high cliffs or otherwise destroyed by on-board saw blades and weapons systems that allowed drivers to take out one another during the course of a race. Speed Racer's Mach 5 car can jump over other cars, deploy any manner of gadgets and even turn into a submarine whenever water becomes an obstacle. I'm sorry, Dale Jr., but compared to Speed Racer, NASCAR just doesn't measure up.",1370217600,4,622,4.822429906542056

3521480,5,B001D11A6I,"as a cult classic, you gotta love Speed Racer.  known for its super-fast speech, this one kind of reminds you of those martial arts films where the mouths don't match the words in the least in that you know it was originally in Japanese.  and that fast talking is what it is known for to my friends and I who caught it on MTV at the time.  so if it is compressed well imho that adds to that aspect.  it also is telling in that there are so many words to get the idea across that for those of us who find it charming we find there is also stuff going on in these adventures.  Speed hooks you like a soap opera in that many of its episodes have multiple parts.  there is no bad language, but being it was really a Japanese cartoon the tone of the story was somewhat dark at times as compared to US animation from its time.  however, speed is a race car driver who is the good guy who invests himself to save the day even though it involves a lot of danger and it isn't certainly isn't required of him to do anything.  i find that he has to have a lot of virtue to do that.  the humorous rate of speech and Speed's virtue are uplifting and while the show is dark in tone at times these things give it a reassuring feel as does the theme song in the beginning and end.  the catchy theme song is also a part of its being a cult classic and is on the upbeat side and i find myself singing it.  you should see the Japanese version of the opening theme on youtube after you watch the series.  it's neat to see the contrast between the versions from the two cultures.  you should also check out wikipedia's explanation of the play on the word ""go"" which is kind of interesting.
a decent series and a cult phenomenon at that!  Go Speed Racer go!",1367366400,3,1735,4.079646017699115

3521514,5,B001D11A6I,"The  Japanese animated T.V. show, SPEED RACER, made its initial American debut way back in 1967. Since then it's been in syndication all over the world, winning new generations of fans who recognize quality when they see it.

As a kid in the early 70's, I was deeply inspired by the show, especially because it was instrumental in teaching me how to draw. I'd spend hours and hours drawing all the characters, not being satisfied until I captured their likenesses and proportions with pencil and magic marker.

SPEED RACER had a more realistic style than most '60's animated fare, not only artistically but thematically as well. It was more ""grown up"" in its plots and characterizations, and the rip-roaring action had a cinematic flavor. The background animation cels approached the level of a Disney feature length film, and the show employed interesting camera angles and lighting reminiscent of the fabulous Fleischer SUPERMAN cartoons from the '40's.

In addition to its famous, catchy theme song, SPEED RACER had great music throughout, underscoring drama and excitement like no other animated series of the time.

This beloved, groundbreaking classic is available as a 6-disc set that contains all 52 episodes, looking as sparkling fresh as when they first came out. DVD extras include The SPEED RACER Files, which contain notes and clips on various aspects of the show, featurettes on the history of SPEED RACER and the making of SPEED RACER: THE NEXT GENERATION, and an episode of the latest incarnation.

The original SPEED RACER is a show that can be enjoyed regardless of your age, and if you loved it as a kid, chances are the kid in you will still get revved up by it all over again. Go Speed Racer, GO!!!",1339459200,,1719,4.890034364261169

3521517,5,B001D11A6I,"Son is totally into Cars, so on a whim, bought it.  We LOVE it.  I love the short episodes that keep us hanging, and honestly it makes me nostalgic for old shows that had this format that you watch a little every day and it keeps going on (Spiderman i think also), with such thrilling chase scenes, cliff hangers, and silly comic relief.  And the guilt of family tradition, and family business and respect for elders, etc etc, cultural stuff is so intriguing - stuff that we don't have here in the US.

Its violent for young children (guns and smoking), but not disturbing, oddly.  Enjoy it.",1334275200,,591,4.485981308411215
3521518,5,B001D11A6I,"Creative writing, incredible characters, top notch animation (for its time), great voice actors, thunderous action sequences, imaginative art and design and amazing atmosphere lead to one thing: a legendary, iconic, revolutionary, pop cultured filled and amazing cartoon that can never be duplicated. I grew up watching ""Speed Racer"", ""Ultraman"", ""Jonny Quest"", ""Land of The Lost"", the ""Banana Splits"" and ""Valley of The Dinosaurs"". ""Speed Racer"" is a multi-generational, multi-cultural event in the world of television and cartoons and it is second to none. Rather it be the haunting ""GRX"" episode, the stunt-filled episodes with the ""Car Acrobatic Team"", the haunting ""X-3"", the brutality of the car wrestling match, the mayhem of the ""Mammoth Car"" or the destruction of the ""Monster Car"". This cartoon blows away almost anything out in the last 30 years. My children love this cartoon too. 10/10.",1328054400,10,899,5.428571428571429

3521520,4,B001D11A6I,"This old animated classic from Japan is far better than the modern attempt to remake and recapture the past success of Speed Racer.  The artwork is excellent and the stories are exciting and dramatic without being overly violent. Even though the animation is somewhat outdated when compared to other anime series from Japan, this older original version of Speed Racer has a more compelling feel to it and a more detailed character construction than the modern series does. It's simply far, far better.  Speed Racer is a tough character , he never backs down from a challenge despite some ""very"" crazy  races that most sane drivers would never think of getting involved in..., like racing through an active volcano for example..., but Speed Racer also has a sensitive and heroic side.  It's a great series and can be enjoyed by both children and adults.  The DVD's worked perfectly, audio and video were perfect.

They are still watching their way through the series (I'm glad this is a complete collection), and they like the action, the storylines, and the characters (Speed Racer, Trixie, and Racer X).",1317772800,3,365,4.126760563380282
3521523,5,B001D11A6I,"I think I just read the funniest review ever on Amazon. It was written by WinfieldLizzie on this product. They claim that the ""C"" word is used in an episode & that there is probably other bad language. Well, I wasn't even going to bother looking it up, but was going to say that they must have misheard the word, as it would never appear in a TV cartoon from the 60s. But my curiosity got the best of me & I threw in the DVD. I went to the spot they mentioned & put on my closed captioning. If WinfieldLizzie had done this, it would have saved them a lot of trouble & saved them from looking like an idiot. The word in question is actually the word ""con"". Truth be told, it sounds a bit like the ""C"" word, if you're listening for it. Anyway, feel free to buy this set, as there is nothing offensive in it. I would have commented on WinfieldLizzie's review, but they didn't allow commenting on them. Understandable. Too bad their bad review affects the product's rating, as it is brought down due to stupidity.

As for the quality of the DVDs, they are top notch as far as video & audio. There is some speed up in some episodes to fit them all on the discs, but it is hardly noticeable. The packaging is the new sleeved package that have been seen recently in discount DVDs. In my opinion, they're well worth the price. If you like the show, get it.

They are in their original state (not over dubbed or enhanced).  I really am happy with this and my kids are too.

Its funny but when you watch these cartoons the topics of some of the plots ring true today. the only thing not so nice for a little child is they are pretty violent but i think they were made for older kids not for a three year old.,1262822400,7,404,4.0625

They liked it and I told them how it was based on an old cartoon.  They wanted to know more, so for my youngest's 6th birthday, I ordered the complete set.  Everything came on time as ordered.  The two boys love it!  As opposed to other cartoons the kids watch, I actually enjoyed watching the episodes with them and remembering most from my own childhood.  It is a fun thing to do on a rainy day and when Mom needs a break.  We watch an episode or two at a time, but still have not seen them all, yet.  I think I enjoy it as much as them.

But the episodes are just as I remember them and still thrill me as they did all too many years ago which is amazing in itself since the production quality of anime back then was not good.

8290898,4,B001D11A6I,"Now this is the series I grew up watching and loved!  This made it's debut in the year I was born, 1967. It is one of the only things I remember watching from my childhood.  I loved the racing and how utterly cool the cars looked.  More than that, I think I was in love with Speed Racer himself.  Now don't laugh, a child younger than 5 can have a crush on anyone she wants to right?

But back to the story line and this set of DVDs.  Action, adventure, mystery, fast cars and lots of humor.  What little boy didn't want to be Steve Racer or little girl Trixie?  Or the other way around, it doesn't matter.  And I wanted a monkey too.  Did I buy this to relive some weird childhood fantasy?  Of course not, I bought it for my grandchildren who were 6 and 5 back then.  Some of the cartoons they have these days can become a little monotonous after a while.  So why not get them something that I would enjoy watching too?  In fact, the whole family got into watching these episodes together.  Every Saturday morning for the longest time we watched these, every single episode for I don't know how many months and then they were off again picking favorite episodes to watch over and over again.

I knew with Speed Racer I didn't have to worry about any language, it was against Federal Broadcasting Regulations (or whatever it is called, lol) back then wasn't it?  There isn't any awkward adult situations or comedy.  There are fight scenes but I would much rather have those fight scenes than the things they portray in some children's animation today.  Just some clean wholesome fun that we could all enjoy together.  Kids want you to be fully engaged with them.  They don't like it if you are not in the room with them or even if you are in the room but occupied with your smart phone or tablet.  They want you watching, commenting, and laughing right along with them.

One of the first realizations I made as a grandmother is that grandparents are here to show our grandchildren how to have fun, how to enjoy life, how to just be who you are.  Parents don't have that luxury. They have to deal with everything under the sun, the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Speed Racer is about having fun, enjoying life, following your dreams, being who you are.

I actually bought this set several years ago but as I was going through some old Amazon purchases saw that I never took the time to review it.  This set definitely deserves a review!  I do, unfortunately, have to deduct one point for the fact that the DVD's didn't come packaged in a way that would protect them.  It would have been nice if they each had a jewel case instead of an envelope.  Just by looking at how much the price has increased since the time I purchased this, you can tell this is something that people are going to want to keep and collect.  In four years, the price is 4x as much.

I ordered this 5 Disc DVD Speed Racer: The Complete Classic Series on Amazon and paid full price for it.  I was in no way obligated to write a review but have only done so because I enjoyed them so much.  I enjoy sharing my experiences with other consumers in order to help them make more informed purchasing decisions.  No one wants to buy something and realize they have made a mistake and wish someone would have warned them first.  Likewise, everyone wants to find a great deal or bargain that they will enjoy.",1454716800,3,3368,4.34991974317817
