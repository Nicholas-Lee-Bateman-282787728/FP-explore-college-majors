I can't even believe these people are in the profession. And the filming.. you could give a bunch of children a video camera and they would do a better job by far!  WHAT A WASTE of $3.  In fact, I would have gotten more satisfaction just throwing the money out of my window vs. watching this again!

My husband and I have watched endless zombie and monster movies. It's our favorite genre. With that said, out of all of these, this has to be the single worse ""homemade"" camcorder quality pile of stinking dung! PLEASE, do not give these people your $2.99. There is a reason you can not see a trailer before you pay. This has ""local theater troupe"" written all over it.....No, I take that back, that may be too generous. There truly was no word for how awful this was. My husband and I sat speechless as we watched the first 10 minutes....I mean, not a word from either of us, just vacant stares. It was that bad. When we finally pulled ourselves together, we tried another 5 minutes, but on fast forward. No, it never got better. I was waiting for someone to jump out on to the screen and hold up a sign saying, ""Just kidding...we were joking!""  Again, please don't part with your money on this one.

It's very Tarantino like where the story moves around events.  Very artsy and dramatic and the zombies aren't the main focus - the people are! Good acting by the leads, Murphy and Devaney and LOVE Terry!  Episodes 7 and 8 are amazing.  They use good real special effects and the make-up looks creepy!  It reminds me of the Original Dawn of the Dead and the darkness of 28 Days Later but with a twist.  If you love zombies, watch all 8 episodes!

This show has real potential, although it seems like a bad start it sets up the
viewer for a well thought out story. I found out this predates the walking dead
by more than a year and while they finished their first season they have been
slow to release their second. I wish they would hurry too because the writing
and the story really start to get great starting in episode 5. The world still
exists and zombies haven't taken over yet. Is it worth it ? Yes, if you want a
soap opera stick to the crap you watch on Sunday nights.",1390780800,,562,4.165137614678899

3691974,5,B001LYMWPU,"Zombie Hunters City if the Dead
Volume 1
Fun, classic, quirky zombie show
Zombie Hunters city of the dead and can it be cheesy ? Plain and simple yes it is. It's great fun !!
I first saw this on Queens public access and thought what is this ? It's grainy and weird and has great music. It's the best thing I've seen on public access! My boyfriend and I decided to grab a copy, get some drinks and see what it was all about.
The zombies especially in the first couple of episodes all dress in plaid shirts. The women are pretty tough in the show and my boyfriend notes that even the zombie women are pretty good looking.
My favorite characters are Carrie and Bates, well all the zombie hunters are pretty cute. I really like that at one point one guy says let's go to Cancun instead of dealing with this.
Things really pick up in episode 3 and there is a cliff hanger at the end of episode 4.
Overall it's fun and most of the acting is really believable but most extras aren't real actors, still it's a good laugh and a fun ride. These guys are New Yorkers and its a blast to see them on screen.
Can't wait to see Volume 2 !",1376006400,,1123,4.109090909090909
3691975,5,B001LYMWPU,"If you like John Carpenter and George Romero then you have to check this out. This is real independent horror. I picked up this DVD set from a convention and I have to tell you that while this is not a ""Hollywood"" production, there is a lot you get from this. Mainly, it's original, not a copy of anything else. What is cool is that these guys with their friends made it. It's rough in parts, but overall it's a real labor of love that has gotten notice by the independent world of horror.

The first episode is a little slow but it picks up, and if you like zombie stories and asking yourself ""What would I  do??"" this is series for you! They mess up at first because they aren't cops -- they're acting as vigilantes, a so-called ""Death Squad"" to protect their family and friends. These guys wrote that on purpose to show realism and mistakes that people make.

I saw this when it came out before The Walking Dead was even on TV and when they only had individual episodes available at conventions and I picked up the whole first season when it was available. Which is two DVDs. Get them both !!! The show just gets better and better !!!

These guys use real special effects not the CGI crap on most Hollywood productions. That's why it looks real, the way Romero and Savini did it in Dawn of the Dead.

The main acting is good-- some guests are great and the direction is very artistic. Trust me the episodes have a lot more action than the whole 2nd season of The Walking Dead. What's cool is that they (the Hunters) aren't the only game in town. There is a group that wants the Zombie Apocalypse to happen. I could have done less with the news scroll but it serves its purpose.

Pay attention to the main characters Cassidy and Bates because they are friends but one guy wants it to end the other guy loves it and thrives in this environment. If you see the tension trust me it comes to a boiling point that any Carpenter fan will love!

It's filmed on location all over NYC and they even address real issues like how would the police and government handle things and would the world collapse in a night?

Zombie Hunters City of the Dead is so much more original then most zombie stuff you'll ever see. Watch it, learn the characters and by episode 4 you'll want vengeance and you'll want to see what else is coming. The second DVD has all kinds of extras and Easter eggs for the fans.

You can tell a lot of time, energy and love went into this show, I can't wait for season 2 !!!",1375401600,4,2484,4.279317697228145
3691976,5,B001LYMWPU,"Normally I don't write reviews on Amazon, but I've really enjoyed the Zombie Hunters series and reading some of the reviews for it on here reminds me just how petty and hateful genre fans can be. I thought I'd take a minute to try to balance out some of these misguided reviews and ad hominem attacks.

There's nothing better than an old horror film. Directors like Whale, Browning, and George Waggner made classics because they loved what they were creating. Even maligned directors like Ed Wood and _The Beast of Yucca Flat_'s Coleman Francis made their movies with a passion lacking in so much of the garbage the film and television studios crank out now. The folks involved in Zombie Hunters clearly share that love for what they're doing. They know zombie mythology, taking inspiration from the best of the likes of Romero, Dan O'Bannon, and Danny Boyle's visions, and adding their own unique spin to the genre.

Some of the previous reviews take shots at the technical aspects of the series, like the special effects or writing. There's no need to wonder if some of these reviewers watched more than the first episode, because the reviewers have said that they didn't bother. Their loss. Is the first episode a little rough? Sure. But it's worth keeping in mind that most first artistic efforts show a lot more in promise than execution. As the series progresses, things get better. Much better, in fact. Once the series finds its footing it truly is remarkable.

Ignore the bad reviews on here. The folks making Zombie Hunters are doing something special; give their work a chance you'll see it.",1375142400,8,1602,4.797101449275362

I haven't gotten the DVD yet, however I have watched the show on the internet because I do not live in New York. Being a Zombie fan, I wish I did at times because of this show. It is a breath of fresh air in a cluttered genre these days. It's almost as if Zombies are ""Safe"" now. It may not have the greatest acting or the biggest budget out there, but Zombie Hunters: City of the Dead is an excellent romp through Zombie Hell. The special effects are very well done for the budget they are working with and I adore the musical score. The scripts seem to flow quite well and the story get's more involved with each episode. My only complaint is that the DVD's aren't coming fast enough so I can keep building my collection.

The Bad: How many times can you miss hitting a Zombie standing in front of you, just one arm length away? And were did those bullets go?
