8235084,5,B000Z7G890,"I am a fan of the Street Series DVD's. Vol. 5 just validates my opinion to the max. All the action and the coverage of these NBA superstars gets me jacked up for another NBA season. I love the piece on Kobe and Wade. Since Dirk won the title a lot of people have been jumping on his band waggon. I've been a fan for a while now of his talents and this DVD gives me the highlights and inside look that I'm looking for. Awesome, awesome DVD. Love it. Absolute 5 star buy.",1309996800,,469,4.0

A bit of bio on some favorite players such as Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett and Dwyane Wade are all here. Fancy footwork and game highlights galore. I recommend.",1258329600,,280,4.30188679245283

Unlike some other dvd's, they really take their time to put the spotlight on these great stars. Not much talk, just A LOT of highlights and great stories !",1219881600,2,310,4.553571428571429
