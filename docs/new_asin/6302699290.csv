7829541,5,6302699290,"In this episode, vampire Barnabas attacks Daphne Collins, who dies and rises as a vampire. Dr. Julia Hoffman finds out about Barnabas vampirism and offers to help cure him. Barnabas also becomes closer with Victoria Winters.
Ben Cross is great as Barnabas, Joanna Going is a stunning and beautiful Vicki Winters, and both are very convincing in their respective roles. It's hard to believe that NBC canceled this series after 12 episodes because it was critically acclaimed, but overlooked in the ratings race. Nevertheless, this is a great collection to own.",977529600,,559,5.153846153846154
7829542,4,6302699290,"This was a remake loyal to the orginal series. And with better acting ;-) (although that was part of the charm of the original).  Ben Cross was  well-picked for the all important role of Barnabus. I think the problem was  that they were recreating the original series episode by episode. I could  see a little backgound or some flashbacks, but I hoped for more than a  retread of the old series. This (the original) series eventually paved the  way for such successful shows as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Charmed.",967680000,,515,4.666666666666667
