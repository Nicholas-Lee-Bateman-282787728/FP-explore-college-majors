7850814,5,6303544819,"One of the great things about the Brady Bunch was that it was a show about some of the problems kids have to face while growing up.  This video contains two classic episodes ""Will the Real Jan Brady Please Stand  Up"" and ""Her Sister's Shadow"".  Marcia is one of the most  popular, smartest, and prettiest girls in school.  Both of these episodes  deals with how Jan has to live in Marcia's shadow, resulting in some of the  best episodes ever made.  No Brady collection is complete without this  video.  A must for all Brady fans!",963446400,9,530,4.484210526315789
7850815,5,6303544819,"Every Brady fan worthy of their bell bottom pants knows these two episodes already.
Do you remember when Jan decided to buy a black curly wig so she would stand out from her sisters? How about when Jan thought that  Marsha's great accomplishments at school were overshadowing her own? - you  know, the ""Marsha, Marsha Marsha"" episode?
The Brady Bunch is  still as amazing a show, as it was in the 1970's with a following that is  one-of-a-kind.
No Brady fan's collection would be complete without these  two classic ""Jan"" episodes.",963360000,9,531,4.791208791208791
