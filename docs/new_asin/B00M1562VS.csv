When I saw the Nureyev version in Paris I thought ""this is it"" but I had little knowledge of Russian ballet at that time. When this original Lavrovsky version was telecast two years ago with the same principals I knew I had to see it live to arrive at a final opinion. The opportunity came when Vishneva and Shklyarov opened the Mariinsky season at the ROH in London last July. This is certainly it and although DV is in her late thirties she IS Juliet and VS IS Romeo. The intensity of emotion these two in this production beam out to you is indescribable ..... when the curtain falls one has to be pretty xxxxx not to have tears in his/her eyes. No wonder someone said ""Paris Opera Ballet dancers dance like civil servants (which they are) and Russians dance like as if their lives depended on it"" !",1431907200,2,964,4.451977401129944

They are both so supple and energetic, and Romeo lifts her so effortlessly that he must be incredibly strong! Their Musicality is flawlessly expressed in their movements, so I've got to say that young Russian Dancers must be getting some excellent Dance Schooling! (Natalia Osipova of the recent Royal Ballet ""Giselle"" is another good example. Did you catch Peter Wright's comment in the Documentary, that she made Classical Ballet look like the most natural thing in the World?)

3) The dichotomy of this Production is that the Sets, Costumes and Direction/Choreography of the Corps De Ballet range from Embarrassing to Downright Silly! I'm surprised that Monty Python didn't get a Credit! The only way to forgive this is to view it as a Historical Document, showing The Russian Tradition established in the Era of Silent Films. All that grimacing, and expansive gestures, which might look OK if you're sitting in the Gods holding your Oxygen Bottle, is truly ridiculous! They need someone from The Royal Ballet (Covent Garden or Birmingham) to show them how Ballet is done today. To paraphrase that Comment made about Peter The Great of Russia, Sir Peter Wright would ""Drag Them Kicking & Screaming into the 21st Century!""

4) I know that Comparisons Are Odious, but if you carefully compare Mariinsky with either of the two BRILLIANT Royal Ballet ""Romeo & Juliet"" Productions, you will see what I mean!",1428364800,,1614,4.974074074074074
8669598,5,B00M1562VS,"I just want to inform anyone who has any second thoughts about ordering this disc, that the error mentioned below has been fixed--I ordered directly from Amazon and my BluRay plays beautifully.

I was very happy with the production itself.  I admit I love classical ballet partly for historical reasons--and before this release the only recording hat was satisfactory of Lavrosky's original production was a Bolshoi DVD of a TV performance from the 1970s--beautifully danced, but often so badly filmed that nothing could be made out.  I am so glad that the Mariinsky is recording HD versions of their repertoire--now if only Gergiev could be persuaded to pull out their reconstruction of the original Sleeping Beauty!  (I know--it will never happen...)

There is much more early Soviet style storytelling than fans of the MacMillan version would expect--but it truly works, especially with the sets and, of course, score.

I miss the chess board design of Lavroskys original production, but otherwise everything seems to be here--and personally I feel like Vishneva--a dancer I am often on the fence about--is perfect in the role of Juliet.",1428019200,5,1140,5.168478260869565
8669599,3,B00M1562VS,"Hum...  I have mixed feelings about it. There're certain parts that are really well danced, but overall I don't enjoy it.  First, I don't like the choreography.  I prefer Royal Ballet's version much much more. Second, I don't like Vishneva's Juliet. I do love Vishneva when her dancing was still pure and beautiful and hasn't developed a habit of doing weird acting in ballet. Third, sorry I'm not a fan of Gergiev, his conducting is way too dull for Prokofiev's music. Fourth, performance of corps de ballet is shockingly terrible, are they really Mariinsky?

Well, the only highlight of this ballet is Shklyarov, one of the best Romeo I've seen. Or I should say, he is THE ROMEO- young, handsome, passionate, impulsive... and he has such wonderful technique. I'd love to see him dancing Royal Ballet's version with a more matching ballerina.",1421712000,7,843,4.915492957746479
8669600,5,B00M1562VS,"I am so glad that I've bought this blu-ray.  I absolutely love it.  Great to have a copy of Diana Vishneva's dance.  Very strong dancers overall, and on top of that, it was conducted by the only Valery Gergiev!!!
Yes there was a bit of music glitch at the beginning of the blu-ray, but it was during the time of displaying the Mariinksy Theatre; therefore, it was way before the ballet, and it had no impact on the performance at all.
I'm very happy with the purchase.",1413504000,6,468,4.35632183908046
8669601,1,B00M1562VS,"Vishneva is simply too old for Juliet, especially when partnered with flamboyantly boyish Shklyarov - she looks like his mother. The production is dated and not particularly interesting, but Vishneva is still the weakest link here. They should have filmed her 10 years ago.",1412899200,9,273,5.2272727272727275
8669602,1,B00M1562VS,"The supplied first copy had a manufacturing fault in the form of loud 'white noise' which obliterated the sound track during three points in the opening menu sequences. The replacement has now been received but has exactly the same fault. It therefore seems that this is a general manufacturing fault, especially as others have reported the same fault as well. The DVD version plays without the fault so the problem probably lies in the disc manufacture rather than the original recording.

As this seems to be a general fault the disc will need to be re-mastered and then re-issued. Faulty discs should be returned and refunds requested pending re-mastering and re-issue. Re-mastering will take several months at least and will only happen if enough discs are returned with appropriate complaints. It is possible that the manufacturers are unaware of the problem which can be solved only when they do become aware.

Additionally purchasers expecting surround sound should be warned that stereo is the only playback option offered. This is of good quality but is inadequate in terms of the 2013 recording date.

...........................................
Further Information - update

One reader who received a defective copy as described has notified me that he now has a perfect copy which he seems to have obtained directly from the manufacturer. This may suggest that the disc may now have been re-mastered.
Meanwhile I note that the price on this site has increased which makes it very expensive for a stereo only disc.
Collectors may therefore find the Acosta version more attractive on both price and sound considerations in addition to any preference over interpretation/choreography/performance etc.
