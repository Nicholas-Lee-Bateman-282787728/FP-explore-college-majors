I have deducted one star because if you view this 3D disc on a non 3D system the picture has a jerky motion that at times is not natural looking, still a razor sharp blu-ray picture but simply not natural looking especially with any fast motion.",1365292800,5,342,4.444444444444445

8548990,5,B00AA9QKOG,"I consider this DVD to be the most outstanding of my entire collection. The 3d filming places the viewer inside the orchestra and zooms in as each player or section has a solo part. The clarity of the disc and depth of the 3d is sensational. Now, let's get to the performance. One can only say that there is no doubt the Berlin Philharmonic is one of the worlds greatest orchestras and Simon Rattle as conductor will delight you. I guarantee you will want to give a standing ovation each time you listen to this disc.",1472169600,2,517,4.395833333333333
8548991,2,B00AA9QKOG,"Not even close to the superior version of Abbado and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra who did it to perfection, as he does with all his Mahler recordings. That is the one to buy to really appreciate Mahler's First. Bernstein's version, with the Vienna, though and older video performance also has more of a wonderful balance of the slow and faster parts than this version.  I found Tilson Thomas' interpretation to be bold and innovative and also far better than this one by Rattle.",1470528000,,480,4.783132530120482
8548992,3,B00AA9QKOG,"Superbly recorded disc which exploits the DTS-HD technology to the limit. I don't own a 3D television but the 2D image is adequate without being stellar. The other strong point of the disc is the superlative playing of the Berlin Phil - consummate musicianship.

Where the disc fails for me however is in the interpretation of both works. Rattle robs both of their punch. He takes the Mahler very slowly and fails to hold the tension through the first movement. In the second, which in Abbado's Lucerne Festival disc sizzles and pops with energy and enthusiasm, Rattle is lugubrious. Where the music oughtto be exuberantly charging at the listener, the slower tempi feel strained, as if there needs to be energy injected into it rather than flowing out of it. The orchestra seems well within themselves and I found myself wondering if they are sensing the lack of a strong leader in the performance.

Similarly, the Rachmaninov is tame - the string melodies to some may sound sumptuous, to me they come across as having been tamed and stripped of their romantic grandeur; toned down to the level of lounge music. The disc annoyed me, when it ended I found myself thinking that this was Rachmaninoff and Mahler done a la Andre Rieu. Perhaps I'm being unfair. Just to reiterate, sonically the disc is stunning and perhaps this is worth the price of admission.

I broke one of my cardinal rules when purchasing this disc which is to make sure that the name of the composer is at least in as big a font as the other credits on the cover. In this disc's case the biggest font here is for the 3D technology followed by the venue of the concert followed by Sir Simon's. The composers are relegated to small type and the title of the works is revealed only after tilting the box!! That to me says a great deal.

I look forward to the Berlin Phil's new leadership.",1435968000,,1855,4.595166163141994

8548994,5,B00AA9QKOG,"In between those who feel that Tennestedt's Mahler's 1st was too ""schleppend"" or draggy (I don't) and those that Tilson Thomas' version was too pushy ( I do ), lie those who feel that Abaddo's had just the right balance in tempo and expressiveness. I loved Abaddo's version and wrote a glowing review of that disc 3 odd years ago. The eagle -eyed amongst you who watched that DVD  would have spotted sitting in the forefront of the audience, rapt in attention, Sir Simon Rattle! So when it was announced that he and the BPO would play a live concert featuring Mahler's 1st in Singapore in November of 2010, yours truly simply had to go. Messrs. Rattle and the Berliners did not disappoint, obliging with a sizzling account of this favourite symphony and what with the fabulous acoustics of the Esplanade concert hall we were left enthralled and leapt to our feet in a breathless standing ovation at the end. So it is very good that we now have a release of this performance in stunning 3D video and equally stunning surround audio. Truth be told the 3D recording was of a full dress rehearsal before the main public performance which is why you see so many students and young people in the audience, but it is still a faithful record of a great performance.
Where would I put Sir Simon's take of this symphony? Well it  certainly has more zip and excitement than Abaddo, though still maintaining a strong grip on dynamics and expressiveness. It is not better than Abaddo's but I would consider it a very strong contender. It evokes more exhilaration than Tilson Thomas' version with its relentless acceleration and is ultimately more satisfying.
Sound wise, Abaddo's was very good, Thomas was even better but this Rattle disc surely takes first prize. From the very beginning where Rattle lingers with the softest of string pianissimo depicting the sounds of nature to the thunderous fortissimo of the stormy movement , the dynamic range on record here is truly breathtaking! And there is great accuracy of timbre too. The opening of the funeral march with the double bass playing the Frere Jacques variation, followed by the bassoon , tuba and then the whole orchestra sounds incredibly true to life and is the best I have ever heard. Yes, and the climactic finale should really blow your rafters off. Kudos , sound engineers.
Videophiles should rejoice too for this version when played on a big screen in 3 D is truly a sight to behold. About a third of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra seem to extend into your living room, giving solid flesh to the musicians and space to the stage and with certain angled shots mind that the energetic bows of the string section don't poke you in the eye or appear to anyway. On 2D playback, if the image appears too hard edged, just ease up on the contrast , brightness and color saturation and things will look natural again, and otherwise there is nothing to complain about.
This is a worthy demonstration disc, especially in its 3D iteration and we hope such cutting edge discs will be released in the future, though this will materialize only if the buying public support it with their wallets. Otherwise I fear the 3D evolution will just fall by the wayside which would be a great pity. 5 stars then for artistic performance and for the stunning audio-visual achievement . What a disc !",1382400000,3,3331,4.711835334476844

8548996,5,B00AA9QKOG,"The first thing to note about this disc, recorded in Singapore in 2010, is the exceptional quality of the recording, both visually and as an audio experience. Not owning a 3D player or television I played this 2D 'compatible' disc using the latest top model Marantz player coupled to high quality audio and can report that there was absolutely no evidence of jerky playback or dark imaging as reported by another reviewer. On the contrary both aspects of the recording were particularly fine.

The tonal resources of this famous orchestra are fully realised by Rattle and the engineers. The sound is wide ranging with impressive depth of stage and dynamics. The bass end of the percussion, such as the bass drum, is particularly well caught as well as the top range such as the triangle and impact of the cymbals etc. The camera work itself gives impressive detail without being invasive.

Simon Rattle is known for his love of passing detail within many of his interpretations and that is what we get here. This approach suits the sound of the orchestra very well. The strings are one of its glories and produce an impressive body of tone from the softest pianissimo to the loudest fortissimo. Woodwind and brass are not doubled except at the demanding conclusion of the Mahler where an extra trumpet is used. The horns stand for the final bars to maximise their effect as Mahler requested.

Staying with Mahler, this performance is markedly different to the ones by Luisi and Abbado, both also on EuroArts plus that by Tilson Thomas. Mahler's excitement at his own composition is quoted in the booklet as 'It grew so overwhelming - flowing out of me like a mountain torrent! ... All the floodgates within me were thrown open in one go.' This is the description of a young man in a hurry. That could not describe this performance which has a tendency to linger throughout the musical journey, admiring the view and making the most of the passing musical scenery. Rattle, approaching a climatic point, frequently reins back the tempo before unleashing the power of the orchestra. Tilson Thomas takes the opposite line and pushes on with, if anything, an increase of tempo at such points. Luisi takes much the same view. Abbado is more circumspect, pulling out much detail but still keeping things on the move but with his typically lighter and clear-sighted approach. Rattle seems to view the work through the eyes of an already mature composer with some hindsight and, as such, this is a very impressive delivery and has clearly been much enjoyed. Certainly it reproduces better than Luisi's 2008 DVD performance which is recorded at a very low level and needs a 4-6 decibel increase of playback volume to come alive properly. Tilson Thomas comes with an (excellent) 2 hour documentary and does not have a concert fill-up which makes the concert performance of the symphony very expensive, but it too boasts superb playing and recording. Abbado also has excellent sound and recording and is coupled to a wonderful performance of Prokofiev's piano concerto 3 by Yuja Wang.

The Rachmaninov has the same performance characteristics. This was written at the end of Rachmaninov's life and it is arguable that Rattle's view is completely valid. The orchestral response is sophisticated and individually and corporately does everything that Rattle demands. Much incidental detail is drawn out lovingly and the big string melodies are luxuriously delivered. What is played down, or missing, is sheer passion, Russian dance rhythms and the percussive energy of the original. At this point it must be mentioned that there are two versions of this music - this orchestral one and a two-piano version which actually came first. The two-piano version also has the same big tunes but is also essentially a percussive work where the rhythmical drive of the dance element is very much to the fore. What is always surprising when listening to the original is how little one misses the opulence of the full orchestra setting. Rattle plays this as if the orchestral version came first and ignores the percussive nature of the piece - strange perhaps in a conductor who started life as a percussionist in the National Youth orchestra. However, once again, this performance has proved to be very well liked.

In conclusion, I would suggest that this is a very fine disc of its type. It will especially appeal to those who enjoy the sounds and sights of a great orchestra playing music which demands a very wide range of tonal and dynamic resources. These demands are fully and impressively met. It will also appeal to those who view these two works as works of maturity and, in the case of the Rachmaninov, as primarily orchestral rather than piano music. The recording itself is glorious and I found no evidence of playback problems on a conventional 2D Marantz player. It might be a good idea to check that players have the latest software updates.

I would suggest that this disc establishes a new level of technical excellence and will give much musical pleasure to those who warm to Rattle's interpretations - very much as the packed, and noticeably young, audience did at the time.",1372550400,6,5168,4.900571428571428
