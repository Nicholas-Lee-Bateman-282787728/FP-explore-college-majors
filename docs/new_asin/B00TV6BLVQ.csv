7022678,4,B00TV6BLVQ,"The film opens with a series of Marine phrases and history which comes quickly across the screen. The longer ones require a pause button to fully read, at least for me. Sgt. Carter (Mike 'The Miz' Mizanin) is now a civilian working for Hawthorne Global Security. It is his first day on the job, as he has a few days worth of growth on his face. His job is to protect (along with a bunch of co-workers) Olivia Tanis (Melissa Roxburgh) a smart talking 24 year old who has information to take down Genesis, who manufactured substandard military hardware. (This must be the military items we never check to ensure they are made to specifications.) Global is subcontracted to the Department of Justice.

The action starts out early and continues through the film. There is some attempt at ""First Blood"" type of scenes that could have been better developed to make the film more interesting. Tanis, who initially loathes her protectors, especially Carter, quickly must rely on Carter for survival.

The film suffered from the same problems as previous films. The Miz can't act. The plot is straight, improbable, and mindless. The dialogue is dry. On the plus side the creation of the character Olivia Tanis provided the needed internal drama and conflict as she becomes the wild card in the film that is otherwise void of mystery and surprises. Danielle Moinet, the blond on the cover has a minor role and few lines. For some reason, late in the film, she does take off her vest so we can see her in a tank top.

Good mindless action film for those who can't get enough of Steve Austin type acting.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Excessive gun fire and some knife fights. Minimal blood.",1428796800,16,1685,4.6824324324324325

7022701,3,B00TV6BLVQ,"THE MARINE 4
MOVING TARGET

I have enjoyed all of The Marine movies that the WWE has released thus far and I am sure I will enjoy future installments. The first one was really fun and I loved the setting and story behind 2 and then of course I really enjoyed The Miz in the third one. So I was pretty sure I was going to like this latest one.

Miz returns as Jake Carter and has a new job working security thanks to a friend. They have an assignment to watch over and transport a witness who has information for the Department of Justice. All is well upon pick up but it is during the transporting part that things go wrong. The team is ambushed on the road by a group of mercenaries who takes out most of the security detail. Carter escapes with the young lady whom he is protecting but the mercs are hot on their trail.

This is your typical straight to DVD B level action movie but those are the things I like. Sure I did like the previous one with Miz better but this was good. The action is just what you would want and the acting is just what you would expect. Miz and Summer are good here, although Summer does not have too many lines but her role didn't call for it. The story from Alan McElroy is good enough for this franchise, in fact he was a writer on the first Marine and another WWE flick, The Condemned 2 starring Randy Orton. You may remember him as the writer of the Wrong Turn films or the Spawn film and animated series. Along with Halloween 4 among others I have to say that I have enjoyed his work.

I can say the same thing for the director as well, William Kaufman, as I enjoyed his Cuba Gooding Jr. flicks The Hit List and One in the Chamber along with Dolph Lundgren. He did a good job here just keeping the story going and never feeling boring. I have to say that over all I did enjoy this flick, not the best from WWE but not the worst I don't think. You get some good behind the scenes and making of features on the DVD. Over all if you are a fan of anyone involved then I think you will like this.",1472169600,,2027,4.072681704260652

7022704,3,B00TV6BLVQ,"Marine 4 was just like any movie remake I'd seen recently.  While it's more of the same thing we've got new faces in the roles.  Professional wrestler Mike Mizanin stars as this reboot.  (When you think of the reality of it, professional wrestling IS acting so he's certainly not new to the idea.)

The plot isn't difficult, there's not a whole lot of thinking required.  The action is perfectly scripted for a wrestler to understand and work with.  Is there a reason to own this?  If you have the others and want the full set.  Otherwise, watch it and move on.  You'll survive, I'm sure.",1469145600,,588,4.523809523809524

7022718,3,B00TV6BLVQ,"Jake Carter (The Miz) is now a retired marine starting his first day in his new career working for Hawthorne Global Security who were hired by the Department Of Justice with the high level assignment of protecting a whistleblower with a bad attitude named Olivia Tanis (Melissa Roxburgh), who has important information on a corrupt army defense contractor, until she's taken into custody however their vehicles were ambushed by mercenaries lead by Simon Vogel (Josh Blacker) leaving Jake & Olivia as the only survivors as they figure out that someone involved with the transfer tipped off the mercenaries.  Jake is determined to stick to his mission to protect Olivia but still deal with various issues from Olivia not trust him, discovering who the mole was & that person using his influence against him, and fighting the group of mercenaries (one of them played by WWE diva Summer Rae) many different times who eventually started having tension between themselves.

This was the second time in the history of WWE Studios that a movie sequel had a direct connect to the previous movie with Miz once again playing the Jake Carter character but the twist being him showing his moral standard as a Marine where he must carry out his assignment instead of how it's been previously in this series where they went after a family member who was kidnapped and I really enjoyed him in this role while the movie was filled with action from different scenes of gun-play & fist fighting with the plot having some twist (nothing we haven't already seen in at least two of these previous Marine movies) but everything was still easy enough to follow throughout the film with the only nitpicking downfall (for wrestling fans more than anything else) is how Summer Rae is heavily promoted in this movie to the point where she shares the DVD cover but her role was nothing more than a background character instead of a leading or even secondary role but it's worth a watch overall.",1449273600,,1965,4.827893175074184

7022752,3,B00TV6BLVQ,"Not enough Summer Rae. That pretty much sums up the movie for me. The action was good, with some good firefights allong the way. The main bad guy was especially likable as the villain. The main actor also does well in his role of protecting some girl because she knows something bad about some bad people. Still, I came into this for Summer Rae, and there simply wasn't enough of her. She gets only 2-3 lines and is not used to her potential. For example, she is kind of shown to be some kind of sniper at the begining of the film so I expected a sniper showdown near the end of the film. No, didn't get that. It wasn't a bad movie by any means and was better than past Marine movies, but yeah... more Summer next time guys.",1433980800,3,724,4.178571428571429

Summer rae has such a small role she shouldn't really be on the cover. SPOILER ALERT coming up:

I really wish they hadn't killed her off. It would have been great to see her do her own series of action movies. Who knows though, it is the movies and anything can happen.

There are so many more wwe stars on the roster to pick from, so why the miz is beyond me. Other then that the only other complaint I have is it was short. I watched it, but couldn't even enjoy it.

I truly dislike wrestling so I have no idea who these people are in the wrestling world, so it is not some allegiance to them. I am not sure but this might be the second best out of the 4 as far action sequences go. The hand to combat is pretty good and so is the fire arms fighting. But each new marine movie gets further and further away from a reason that makes sense. The first two marines had their wives kidnapped, the third had his baby sister kidnapped. This 4th one is a recent marine veteran starting a new protection job here in the states. And on his first day his team is set up. The plot is all downhill from there and acting is just barely bearable.",1430524800,,785,4.103896103896104

7022790,4,B00TV6BLVQ,"The Marine 4: Moving Target is a fine movie and I enjoyed it. It's like watching an episode of the A-Team, plenty of over the top action. No F-Bombs & No Nudity. There are minor amounts of blood when someone is shot, but nothing worth worrying about as you see more blood on East Enders and Coronation Street. I don't know what Certificate it will have upon U.K. release but if it higher than a 12 it would be unwarranted as the Marvel films are more violent.

This film carries on with the character from the previous Marine film, which gives this series some continuity at last (I hated that there was a different character in each of the first 3 films) and is in my opinion better for it as it builds on the character. Acting wise this film won't win any Oscar's but I found it highly enjoyable and I hope that they use the character again in any future instalment of the Marine franchise.

I bought this from the U.S. as the U.K. does not seem to have a Blu-ray release scheduled (at this time) and as I have the previous 3 films on Blu-ray I took the chance that the U.S. version was Region Free (like the U.S. release of The Marine 2. As that is only available on Blu-ray on U.S. Import). It states on the packaging Region A only, but I can confirm that it is Region Free as it played in my U.K. Sony Region B locked player.",1430265600,11,1330,4.211764705882353

7022795,3,B00TV6BLVQ,"I was beginning to think the movie would never start, when it finally did. Thankfully.
Lots of action, things getting blown up and mounds of gun violence. Pretty much everything I look for in an action movie. The side story was protection detail.
I realize the main character used to be in the forces, and the title of the film makes you think war is involved or something, but it's not. This movie, and the 3 previous films, follow a marine after he gets discharged. I like this approach, as we all probably wonder what they do after they leave the service.
The female lead character I wanted to slap the crap out of, most of the time. I'm glad they kept her safe, but she was a pain in the ass.
Though it was super predictable, lots of action fans will enjoy this movie.",1429574400,3,772,4.3310344827586205
7022796,3,B00TV6BLVQ,"Do you trust me now? Jake Carter (Mizanin) is a marine who is charged with protecting Olilvia Tanis (Roxburgh), a high profile whistle blower who has numerous death threats against her. When someone in Jakes organization is revealed to be a traitor he has to not only fight off the traitor but also keep Olivia safe so she can testify. This is a movie that is pretty much what you expect. An hour and a half of stuff blowing up and violence with a little plot. The main problem with these movies is that there is really no suspense. When you get to the fourth movie in a series you pretty much can predict how it will go from the beginning. This is no exception. On the other hand though, I have seen much worse direct to DVD sequels and this one was at least entertaining enough to keep me awake. Overall, another unnecessary sequel, but one that is at least watchable. I have seen, and expected, much worse. I give this a B-.",1429574400,,927,4.333333333333333
