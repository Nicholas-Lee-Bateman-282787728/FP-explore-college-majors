Movie watching ( a close second is Mercy Mission).

When I started watching this I was Late Young , and now I identify
strongly with Jason Robard.  I see something new every year. Buy the movie. You won't regret it.",1228867200,3,354,4.268656716417911
1200887,5,B00000F2TQ,"I first watched this movie in the late '70s - my mom made me sit down and watch it.  It was presented as a ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" made-for-TV movie.  As it turns out, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen, holiday or not.  It will make you laugh and cry, and may even render some goosebumps with the point it makes about life.  If you have not seen this movie, please give yourself a treat at Christmas and sit down to watch this movie with family and friends - you won't be sorry.",1132704000,17,490,3.9693877551020407

7906490,5,B00000F2TQ,Great story wish Amazon made it available for FireTV. My wife and I have have been searching for this for years. Scrapped our old VHS system years ago.,1506556800,,151,4.428571428571429
7906491,5,B00000F2TQ,"It is hard to contemplate why this movie has not be made DVD.  It is a story that is so captivating, engaging, and inspiring, that is defies rational explanation why it is not a major Christmas movie.  The sacrifice of a mother to protect and nourish her son, the love of a grandmother, and the (natural) demands of a grandfather that his grandson be independent and resilient, herald the hallmark of this story.  The ending, if anyone is able to watch it, marks this movie as a must-have for all Christmases to come.  At 70 years of age, I still weep ... at the ending.",1482537600,,570,4.4

7906493,5,B00000F2TQ,a tape in good shape.  I had been looking for this movie for a long time.  No longer in production.,1443916800,,99,3.9
7906494,4,B00000F2TQ,"It started as a joke ... saying my favorite Christmas movie is one where they get Grandma drunk, but this really is my favorite Christmas movie.  Eva Marie Saint and George Parry turn in stellar performances, yet you will need to endure some wooden acting from Jason Robards.  Joanne Woodward has a supporting role and is magnificent as always.

Tags that could be applied:  family friendly, The Great Depression, heart-warming and classic.

The movie is based on Glendon Swarthout's 1977 novel ""The Melodeon"".

Hoping they will take a second look at this and release it on DVD soon.",1418342400,,583,4.8979591836734695
7906495,5,B00000F2TQ,"I seen this movie on TV but have never seen it again. I checked Amazon for a copy of the DVD.  Found it.  It is 125.00.  That is sick.  It does not cost any more to copy that movie than any other.  There actually a few good movies.  Is that why they are hoarding it.  Why is that cost so high?

7906496,5,B00000F2TQ,"This really first rate Hallmark film should be released on DVD/Blue Ray.
Jason Robards is a farmer, the curmudgeonly grandfather who has never gotten over the death of his son in the first world war. Eva Marie Saint is his long suffering wife, George Parry is the grandson who is foisted off on them because of Great Depression finances,
All three could not be better, and the supporting cast, including Joanne Woodward as  the young boy's mother, are just about perfect..
The plot is simple, even formulaic, but its weaknesses are overcome by the fine acting and some moments of genuine emotional power. Robards lets his old age play for itself with an unadorned grittiness, and Saint, whom I have sometimes found rather wooden, relaxes into a lovely performance, the quintessential grandmother ! The recorded sound ambiance and the musical score are not always in keeping with the visual images.",1384387200,6,897,4.98
7906497,5,B00000F2TQ,"This is one of those movies you see on TV and never forget.  I have remembered it all these years but couldn't remember the name.  Now with all the information resources on the internet, you can get that information.  When I found the title on Amazon using the actors names I held my breath to see if it would be on DVD...Nope...ugh.  As other reviewers have said, it is funny, sad, sweet, poignant...wonderful.  You really get the Christmas feeling with all the snow and it is an old fashioned type Christmas.  Reminded me of some of my own childhood Christmases.  If it were on DVD I would buy it in a hot minute!!",1323475200,,616,4.398230088495575
7906498,5,B00000F2TQ,"IF you like good Christmas movies, this is one that will fit the bill. IT has everything from humor,sadness, joy and love. Jason Robards and Eve Marie Saint are the perfect match for this movie- The movie will brings a tear to any ones eyes  unless you are a Scrooge, but it will also bring a smile. Wonderful Christmas Movie --I loved it.",1294185600,,339,4.380952380952381
