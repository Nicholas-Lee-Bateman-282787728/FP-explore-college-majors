8353855,2,B00271RHP6,"The man himself answers about his creative process. Saul Bass seated in a desk, in 1977, gives the context of some, but just some of his works. With a strange structure, - 'cause maybe for someone who doesn't know he was sort of the father of the movies' titles with a twist in a time they were just plain Helvetica over white or black drop- the movie presents titles from: 'The man with the golden arm' -a classic with awesome music, white stripes, and luxuriant rhythm-, Carmen Jones; then some 'figurative' -not just fonts and animation, but actual photography, faces, sea from 'In Harm's way' and 'Seconds'; the narrative structure (think of 'Catch me if you can' titles) of 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' and the 'West side story' (graffiti with the names in it). Then sort of boring big sequences of 'The Big Country' a western, and something called 'The Victors' -a collage about WWI-; it cames Grand Prix -Speed Racer without animation-. A thing with a clock -zzzzzz- called 'Nine hours to Rama', and an extraordinary piece with a cat from 'Walk on the Wild Side'. And thats all folks!

Where it is: 'The seven year itch'? the ending credits of 'Around the world in eighty days'?, !!!! Hitchcock's  Psycho from the sixties!!!!! -the real sequel to his own 'golden arm'-, Spartacus?, the first 'Ocean eleven's' -a classic on its own right!-? War of the Roses, Cape Fear, and Age of the Innocence and Casino?
None of them! At the end we had around 7 minutes of actual Bass' voices and opinions.

 This is not a documentary, just a 'featurette', -remember is just 30 min long, and if it would be priced around half -I paid 39.90 dlls!!! in 2011- it would be ok, at least they could add the Bass' 'Why man Creates' -his ideas about creation!!.
 Really is much more didactic to surf the net and look after all his titles available in many pages...
Pass on Bass here, BUT go and see it and love him, and get crazy about his work somewhere else...

By the way later I learned -grrrr- that if you buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Short-11-Ecstasy/dp/B000055WG3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Short 11 - Ecstasy</a>&nbsp;there is also Bass on titles, but a MUCH lesser price...",1294272000,5,2221,4.862433862433862
