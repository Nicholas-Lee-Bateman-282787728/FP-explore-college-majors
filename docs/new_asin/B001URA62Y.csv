The behind the scenes parts, the director's explanations about his artistic choices, and of course - The wonderful music, singers and overall performance.
I would recommend this to every Mozart lover, and for those who would like an easy way in to the world of opera.
Wonderful!",1400284800,,307,4.923076923076923
8344794,5,B001URA62Y,"This is an excellent DVD of a behind the scenes look at how television films are made, in this case a film about an opera. And not just any opera at that, but one on Mozart's earliest,most exotic, and most romantic - Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail. The Italian version of the name is the Seraglio (or in English readers minds --that Turkish Opera).  Set in a former Turkish Palace in Istanbul one of the twentieth century's finest opera directors,Elijah Moshinky-originally from Australia but now resident in London, takes the viewer through the plot and brings out the historical context of the play while describing the various characters through different pieces of music.

He shows the reader the historical connections to Mozart's time through the music. His treatment of Blonde's aria to the Moorish overseer is brilliant  and funny. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra provide the music under the legendary Sir Charles Mackerras (who is visible early in the DVD).  Some of the players are unknown but all are disciplined in their approach and carry their parts very well,especially Peter Rose and Yelda Kodalli. There are no weak spots in this cast. The costumes are in period style and are luxuriously glorious. The finale is visually and musically spectacular and is the highlight of the DVD. This DVD production is highly recommended for opera fans and historical buffs alike.",1356652800,2,1380,5.0394736842105265
8344795,3,B001URA62Y,"This film is in essence NOT what it claims to be - it is NOT ""Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail"".  While it chewing and dissecting  incessantly Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail, it is in reality only fragments of that great opera, chopped to fit the director's taste, who in turn showcases his erudition of the whole opera genre by referring to the ""Cats"".  Perhaps before making this film, ""Cats"" was the only opera Elijah knew.

Alas, we simply do not have the whole continuous opera here, which is a real pity, since the original idea of making it ""on location"", in Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, seems very promising.  The initial teasers excite the anticipation - the views of Istanbul seashore, its hills, the palace itself - all titillate imagination.  Then Belmonte, in a costume of Mozart's time, walks to the palace, singing Die Entfuhrung opening aria ""Hier soll ich dich denn sehen"".

But it is interrupted by director's talking, and then the same pattern continues throughout, yet at the end we do not have the whole ""opera"" - the word opera means ""a work"" - so the actual work was not completed here, unfortunately.

I still give it three stars because I loved the scenery, and from that point on whenever I see Die Entfuhrung the images from this incomplete production conjure up in mind.  The same was in Berlin on June 13 this year, where this opera was staged.  The singing was excellent, I posted some videos on youtube:

Here on this DVD, however, the singing is superb, too - I loved Yelda Kodalli as Konstanze, and Desire Bancatore as Blonde.  I'd say that if this production was complete, it would end up better than a classic Die Entfuhrung with Edita Gruberova and Karl Bohm, easily available on DVD here and everywhere.  I find Kodalli Konstanze a very inspiring image, young, vulnerable and arrogant, quite different from Gruberova's interpretation.

Another pleasant character here in Peter Bone as Osmin; his voice is somewhat higher than a normal Osmin, and it sounded refreshing.  The famous scene of Blonde teaching Osmin art of love in ""Durch Zrtlichkeit und Schmeicheln"" aria is so marvelously staged here - so naturally and funny, with Desire Bancatore putting up a splendid performance.

All in all, I recommend this video due to great singing and scenery, while keeping in mind that the magic of continuous music will be interrupted here - perhaps the director thought that there were too many notes in the whole opera.",1309046400,4,2478,4.875894988066825
