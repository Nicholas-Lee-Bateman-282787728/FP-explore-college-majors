185308,5,1563311976,"Anthony Hopkins, although a smaller character in the film, shines brilliantly under the great direction of John Madden.  Gwyneth Paltrow is also spectacular in this film, but I want to mention the two actors who make this movie even better.  First of all, Hope Davis is perfectly cast as Paltrow's sister.  Her portrayal does everything it's supposed to.  She made me very irritated and angry, but in a way that really boosts the plot of the film.  Also, Jake Gyllenhaal, although not a powerful character, has really proven himself this year.  With a fantastic performance in this film, along with a great performance in Jarhead and even better in Brokeback Mountain, Gyllenhaal is my pick for breakout actor this year.  Bravo to this amazing ensemble cast.",1139616000,5,758,4.968253968253968
185309,3,1563311976,"There are so much to admire in John Madden directed `Proof' - Gwyneth Paltrow's acting for example - but there are also many flaws in it, the worst being its stagy and talky nature of the film.

At first `Proof' unfolds like a mystery. As many say on the net, the film is based on the critically acclaimed play (which I have not seen). It is about Catherine (Paltrow) and her recently deceased father Robert (Anthony Hopkins). Robert was a genius of mathematics, but his last days, as is suggested in flashbacks, were troubled ones.

Now one interesting thing happens after his death. Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), former student of Robert, finds a notebook, which might or might not contain a brilliant finding of mathematics. Of course, we need a proof as to the authenticity of the writing. But eventually Hal realizes another proof is needed: who really wrote this?

[STAGY (YOU MAY LIKE IT OR NOT)] `Proof' is no more about mathematic theories than `A Beautiful Mind' was. `Proof' is about Catherine and other three characters - her father, Hal, and her domineering sister Claire (Hope Davies). Almost all the dialogues are exchanged between Catherine and one of these three roles, and their exchanged words, which often get emotional, suggest the truths about their relations and the past. The method is notable for its lengthy speech, which reminds us its stage origin, and whether you like it or not, you never forget that you are watching a filmed version of a stage production.

But perhaps that would not be really annoying. Paltrow' shows splendid acting, so does Hopkins. Unfortunately Davies and Gyllenhaal are less compelling than the other two, partly because Davies's character is basically a off-putting one, and Gyllenhaal's unconvincing. His must show enough intelligence to convince us that he can notice the true value of the notebook in his ex-instructor's library. Sorry, but I couldn't see anything like that.

Oscar-winning `Shakespeare in Love' is one of my favorite films, but if the director had been someone else, it could be much better than what we are seeing now. John Madden, who directed both `Shakespeare' and `Proof,' handles the material pretty well here, but the results are far from perfect. The overuse of flashbacks is confusing, and when the film shows the romance, his direction becomes suddenly banal. And it must be admitted that the film gets silly sometimes. Throwing such a precious notebook into a car window? Didn't he think of any better idea?

`Proof' has intelligence, and the academia presented here looks real enough. But I'm afraid that is exactly the reason I was disappointed with the film. The performance is strong and good enough to make us care the characters while the story is convoluting, requiring us too much patience to follow it. The film says the notebook contains a significant discovery of mathematics while they don't even think of the simplest way to prove who wrote it In this way the characters are presented with superb acting, but we are never truly allowed to feel the pains or regrets of them.",1137542400,7,3067,4.934108527131783
185310,4,1563311976,"As she reaches the ripe old age of twenty-seven, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) struggles to come to grips with the death of her father, a brilliant mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) who suffered from mental illness. Inheriting her father's genius and passion for numbers, Catherine left her own work five years earlier to care for her father through the past five years of his life. Catherine is also afraid that with her father's brilliance, she is doomed to share his end, a concern exacerbated by her estranged sister Claire (Hope Davis). Working with Catherine to sort through her father's notebooks is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a PhD student. The film is about the discovery of a mathematician and the authorship of a brilliant proof.

Hollywood portrayals of university campuses (er, campi) are often something of a stretch, but I found that in ""Proof,"" academia had a realistic feel. The campus itself is easy enough to show, with grand old buildings and manicured grounds, but to get a clear understanding, one needs to look into the buildings, into the professors' offices and the discussions they have with their students. One needs to hear the students calling home to check on aging parents and dealing with conflicting demands on their time and attention. All of these elements were captured and presented effectively.

Performances were uniformly well-done: Paltrow and Hopkins made for a convincing daughter-father pair, with the daughter's concern for her father leading her to choose between her own brilliant career and the care of her father and the father's mixed feelings of comfort from his daughter's presence and frustration at her apparent unwillingness to continue her own promising research.

The film carries with it a certain sadness and loss; after making several lifetimes' accomplishments in several fields, Catherine's father starts ""to get sick,"" at about the age of twenty-six. The rest of his life was a downhill struggle with mental illness and he could be seen as yet another example that in mathematics, practitioners finish their best work not long after completing their PhDs. I could not help but be reminded of ""Losing It,"" a Rush song:

  Sadder still to watch it die

  Than never to have known it.

  For you, the blind who once could see,

  The bell tolls for thee.

But rather than focusing on the loss of a brilliant mathematician, the film places his work and his life in context. While ""the machinery"" is gone, the man inspires and drives and his earlier work endures, to be used as foundation for another generation of mathematicians.

It's a wonderful story, presented well on-screen, and it's good to see scientists being seen as something cool for general audiences.",1137110400,8,2715,5.078828828828829

185314,5,1563311976,"I was clueless in the decorating area when I got married.  My mom was a natural and had an electic style.  It didn't come naturaly to me so I was totally freaked out when it came time to buy carpet and furniture and paint and redo the kitchen.  Our house self-destructed and I didn't know which way to go and knew that every mistake I made would be one we couldn't afford to fix.  I like all styles and there are so many colors and ideas that it's overwhelming.  I thank God I happened to catch the Lynette Jennings Decorating TV show when this video aired.  It made it all so easy and now I get raves about my decorating and it's all stuff I learned from this VHS.  I'm buying copies for my daughters and another one for me because I'm always giving my copy away. Lynette gives great advice, she's  intelligent, gutsy & FUN!

Your husband will probably freak when he sees the Oatmeal carpet being replaced by Hollyhock (a real cool color of burgandy) and the white (ugh!) walls being painted Forest Green.  Tell him to go buy tires or whatever else he does.  When its done he'll be singing your praises!! Remember to consider his deer heads or fish or golf stuff or whatever he likes, tho.

The relationships between Catherine and Claire, Hal, and Robert were so emotional. I loved this movie. Just loved it. It was the kind of movie where you watch it once and you want to go back and watch it again. I'm not typically a Gwyneth Paltrow fan but she was so good in this role.

It's about a brilliant mathematician, and the main character (his daughter), that both work on, well, mathematics. But besides math, the story is about a girl who takes care of her father who has a degenerative disease. A close bond between father and daughter, the story draws out a dramatic plot between the daughter and life itself.

And like the title, the movie is about a particular proof. However, it doesn't tell you what the proof is about. It's simply a story about a girl, somewhat of math, and her family and friends.",1466467200,3,609,4.62962962962963

That is: As a former math major, I find this movie fascinating. Someone involved clearly knew a lot about math, because the descriptions of the struggles involved in striving to the highest levels of mathematics, as well as the nature of searching a difficult proof, strike me as knowing and insightful.

Gwyneth Paltrow gives an earnest performance and makes for a sympathetic and believable lead. The other actors are up to par and nicely compliment her character. The film tries to hit a sentimental note, and move the audience with some dramatic scenes. I cannot say it totally comes off, but it comes off well-enough.

185338,4,1563311976,"Part drama. Part love story. This film falls somewhere in between but satisfies neither genre.

Here's the scoop. Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been taking care of her father (Anthony Hopkins) who was once a brilliant mathematician but has gone round the bend over resent years. A younger math geek (Jake Gyllenhaal) has been living in the house and gleaning whatever wisdom he can from pops. Dad passes away and sister Claire (Hope Davis) flies in from New York to try and help. A seemingly brilliant math proof emerges but who is the author? Is it dad's or Catherine's?

There's a lot to like in this flick. Paltrow is as good as I've seen her. She wears no makeup and looks somewhere between haunted and exhausted. She's worried she might have caught dad's crazy gene and can't finisher her math studies. She can't concentrate and knuckle down. Hope Davis doesn't get ti. She's been doing the successful New York business thing and stuff that is important to her seems trivial in light over everything else that is happening. Gyllenhaal isn't really putting himself out here. He's stretched a lot more in other recent outings. Hopkins is his usual great self and Hope Davis is at the top of her game. She means well and is sincere, but she just doesn't get it.

The math speak sounds authentic. David Auburn, who wrote the script from his original play, either knows math well or did some serious research. The sets, directing, music and such are all befitting of the project. I guess the problem lies in the tug of war between Paltrow's struggling with her own demons and the developing relationship between her and Gyllenhaal. Neither has a very impactful climax. You see it. It's there. But you don't feel it. The final scene says the two might get there but it was too soft for my dollar.

The average rating here from users is 3 1/2 stars and that's a safe bet. I went to the four because it deserves to be seen. Three stars might keep people from seeing a very worthwhile effort.",1432512000,2,1990,4.644886363636363

She has a relationship with a young man out to find something in her father's journals to build his doctorate on.  He finds a mathematical ""proof"" that is new and unique and then calls her a liar for saying she wrote it.

185369,3,1563311976,"PROOF is a riveting stage play that in FILM form, or, as an image for the masses, lacks the necessary magical empathy that only (live) theatre evokes. Great adaptations are rare as evidenced by the Pulitzer-Prize and Tony Award-winning plays, AGNES OF GOD and 'nIGHT MOTHER that lost their souls when their film counterparts turned these allegorical tales into earnest dramas. Here, in the film PROOF, the director seems satisfied with--or oblivious to--the secret he reveals in the first few minutes, which is the driving force of the action and the core of the drama. That said, the result has a false intensity, and a subsequent 100-minutes of hurry-up and wait that may drive you mad.

To be clear: David Auburn's 2001 Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning play is breathtaking. However, John Madden's artistically insensitive direction of the 2005 film, letting the Jack-In-The-Box pop up before we even get one good psychological go-'round, may be more telling about Hollywood's underestimation of its audiences than about Mr. Auburn's profound play.

Superb acting is the chief selling point of ""Proof,"" the generally interesting film version of the David Auburn play, adapted by Auburn and Rebecca Miller and directed by John (""Shakespeare in Love"") Madden.

Anthony Hopkins plays an aging math genius whose career was cut tragically short when he fell victim to some form of mental illness in his late 20's.  In the years since, he has been little more than a shell of his former self, reduced to shuffling around the house in his bathrobe while filling up endless notebooks - originally intended for brilliant mathematical proofs and formulas - with incoherent messages and doodling.  Gwyneth Paltrow, in one of her most demanding roles, portrays Catherine, his equally bright younger daughter, who is firmly convinced that she is succumbing to the same mental illness that has claimed her father.  Hope Davis is her older sister, Claire, who left their Chicago home to make a new life for herself in New York, but who, now, on the death of their father, has returned with the express purpose of bringing Catherine back home with her in order to ""care"" for her.  The fourth main character is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young math professor who admires the work of the once-great Robert and who, as both a friend and potential romantic interest, really doesn't believe that Catherine is losing her mind at all.

In thematic terms, ""Proof"" makes us ponder where exactly that fine line is that separates sanity from insanity and how we can ever really know if and when we are crossing over it.  As embodied by Paltrow, Catherine becomes a fascinatingly complex character, one whom we seem to be looking at as through a shattered mirror or fractured lens, never quite sure whether each image at any given moment is a true reflection of who she is or a mere illusion.  Paltrow slides in and out of Catherine's many moods with such precision and conviction that she makes us aware of the scary and literally maddening nature of her character's predicament.  As Claire, Hope Davis delivers a beautifully insightful performance as a woman of practicality and reason who apparently has no means of understanding or coping with the certifiable insanity of her father and the possible insanity of her sister.  In the fairly small but pivotal role of the deceased genius, the always reliable Hopkins appears entirely in flashbacks and in scenes depicting Catherine's imagination.  Finally, Gyllenhaal brings an earnestness and intensity to the part of Hal, a character that could have fallen into callowness in less capable hands.

The filmmakers have certainly ""opened up"" the play to the point where it never feels theater-based or stage bound.  The dialogue is literate and incisive, for the most part, although there are times when the movie comes across more as an intellectual exercise than a fully convincing drama about real people.  That`s where, lucky for us, the actors step in to perform their magic.",1185148800,,2958,4.959514170040486
185393,5,1563311976,"Based on David Auburn's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, ""Proof"" revolves around Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow), the daughter of a brilliant, recently deceased mathematician (Anthony Hopkins). Although Catherine has inherited her father's mathematical genius, she fears that her knowledge might come with a heavy price. Her father had a history of mental illness for many years, and Catherine is worried that the disease has been passed on to her. To make matters more complicated, Catherine's pushy sister (Hope Davis) returns to town for her father's funeral and is intent on bringing Catherine back to New York City to stay with her. However, when Catherine shares a breakthrough mathematical proof with her new lover, who also happens to be her father's former graduate strudent (Jake Gyllenhaal), tensions arise as the authorship of the proof is questioned. Did Catherine's father write this amazing proof before his death, or is Catherine its true author?

I thought this film was an excellent adaptation of Auburn's play. Paltrow gives an outstanding performance as a young woman coping with the death of her father, her own personal regrets, and mental instability. Hopkins also delivers a great performance as the delusional father figure, although I wish he had a bit more screen time. The only performance I was slightly disappointed with was Gyllenhaal's, who is kind of a putz. However, his character is a bit of a putz, too, so I guess I can't hold it against him too much.

Okay, so by now it's pretty well known that I will watch anything with Jake Gyllenhaal in it. I mean, I actually watched The Day After Tomorrow all the way through. (For which I still have not received my medal, Mr. Emmerich.) So when I found out Gyllenhaal would be one of the principals in John Madden's adaptation of David Auburn's engaging play Proof, I was pretty much champing at the bit. And I was not disappointed.

Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Claire (Six Degrees' Hope Davis) are sisters, the daughters of Robert (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a disturbed mathematician. Claire moved away years ago and made a name for herself in the financial world; Catherine stayed at home to take care of her father and follow in his footsteps. Gyllenhaal plays Hal, a graduate student of Robert's. The main thrust of the play centers around a complex mathematical proof Catherine claims she wrote; neither Claire nor Hal believe her. We get to sit back and watch the fallout as these three characters ride the emotional rollercoaster, intercut with flashback scenes giving us pieces to the puzzle of whether Catherine or Robert was the actual author of the proof.

""Nakedly manipulative"" is the most tactful way I can put the mystery portion of the whole thing. Auburn (who also wrote the screenplay) knows exactly how to keep the viewer confused, but still thinking he's got a handle on things. To his credit, he does it very, very well. The present-day scenes didn't need a script, really; if you put three actors of this caliber in the same room and hand them a one-sheet scenario, you'd be able to film the improvisation and come up with something worth watching. If the movie's got a dark spot, acting-wise, it's Paltrow, who comes off as shrill and unlikeable at times.

Perhaps part of this was due to the mechanism of jumping back and forth in time--maybe I couldn't get a complete picture of who Catherine was.

185411,5,1563311976,"John Madden, who directed Shakespeare in Love (1998), and David Auburn, who wrote the script (adapted from his play), have put together a moving story about mathematical genius admixed with mental instability much in the manner of the life of John Nash who was the subject of A Beautiful Mind (2001).

Nash was a paranoid schizophrenic who was tormented by voices in his head warning him of dangers and conspiracies that didn't exist.  Like Nash, Robert (Anthony Hopkins) is a brilliant mathematician who, having done spectacular work in his early twenties, goes crazy.  Unlike Nash he is never able to regain control of ""the machinery,"" as he calls his mind, and is never able to do any worthwhile work again.

Or is he?  As he is taken care of by his mathematically astute daughter, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow in a most affecting and beguiling performance) he fills scores of notebooks with intense writings.  At one point he seems in remission and at another point Catherine rushes home to find him in out in the backyard in the middle of a snowy night fired with enthusiasm about his latest work.  At another point, he and Catherine work together on a project.  And herein lies the crux of the matter.  As we discover, this project turns out to be a proof of a difficult mathematical theorem or conjecture that will be internationally celebrated if it is correct.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays Hal, one of Robert's students who is going through his mentor's papers in the hope of discovering something wonderful.  Catherine tells him that among the 103 notebooks that her father filled during his days of mental instability there is not a single one that has anything of value in it.  But when Hal wins her heart she produces a notebook that was locked away in a drawer.  It turns out that this notebook contains that most amazing proof mentioned above.  And it is here that Catherine says--in line that is so very well set up that her expression fairly takes your breath away--""I wrote it.""

Well, did she or didn't she?  Because the work seems to be in her father's handwriting and seems to be well beyond her abilities, her sister Claire, played in that clever but somewhat annoying style that Hope Davis has so perfected (About Schmidt; American Splendor), claims that Catherine is deluded and couldn't have written it.  To Catherine's grievous disappointment Hal reluctantly agrees, and this seeming lack of faith in her sends Catherine toward the precipice of insanity.  This is the key question of the plot.  Who wrote the proof?  Its resolution will be the denouement of the story.

Clearly Claire believes that Catherine is so like her father that she is about to go crazy herself.  So she tells Catherine she wants to sell the house now that their father is dead and bring Catherine to New York where she lives so that she can take care of her.

Will Catherine go or will she trust her heart and begin a life with Hal?

This movie does not play well with some audiences I think because the wonderment that some of the characters feel--the absolute awe that transfigures them when they behold a great mathematical proof, is not entirely appreciated by the average person.  Madden makes sure that Catherine, Hal and one of the mathematicians form on their faces an expression something akin to a religious enthrallment when they understand the thrilling logic of the proof.  I suspect that for many viewers something was lost in the translation.  Consequently, although many others, including myself, believe this to be one of the outstanding movies of 2005 it only rates a 7.0 at IMDb and was not nominated for any Academy Awards.  Paltrow won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance in Shakespeare in Love, also directed by Madden (he seems to bring out the best in her), and that award was richly deserved.  But here in Proof I believe she was every bit as good (in a different way) although she was only nominated for a Golden Globe award and did not win.

Another thing about this movie is that it is strangely affecting emotionally.  You might find yourself misting up a bit as you watch.  I know I did.

185426,4,1563311976,"This is a fairly tough movie to give an opinion on without spoiling the end of the movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow is the daughter of a famous mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) who had some incredible breakthroughs in the field.  At some point Hopkins had gone mad and Paltrow decided to devote all her time to taking care of him rather than place him in a mental facility.  When the movie begins, Hopkins has recently died.

Jake Ghyndenhal (I think that is how you spell it) is a university student that was being tutored by Paltrow at her house.  He wants to examine over 200 notebooks that Hopkins had left behind in the house to determine if Hopkins had made any other breakthroughs that nobody knew of.  Paltrow tells him that all the notebooks were gibberish scribblings made during Hopkins insanity however, Jake insists that he needs to look at them.  This makes Paltrow suspect Jake of wanting to steal and publish some of her father's ideas as his own and she even accuses him of trying to steal some of her father's notebooks.  Jake does have one in fact, hidden in his jacket but he claims that he kept it only to give it to Paltrow as a gift because there was a note to Paltrow written by Hopkins in one of his lucid times.

In the meantime, Paltrow's sister comes from out of town to help settle Hopkin's estate much to Paltrow's chagrin since her sister wants to sell the house and force Paltrow to move to New York with her.  Paltrow always hated her sister's superior attitude and this angers her to no end.

The movie is fraught with flashbacks throughout especially to the one year period where Hopkins had become lucid.  During that time Hopkins had wanted to work and tackle mathematics again with Paltrow as his assistant.  He sits outside in a snowstorm writing.  When Paltrow explains all this to Jake and her sister, the audience is not sure whether what she tells them specifically about this episode (to say what would be a spoiler) is the truth or totally made up by Paltrow.

The end of the movie presents the audience with a paradox and the audience is not sure whether the claims of Paltrow are the truth or not (we are never sure if the same madness that had overtaken her father had overtaken her too).

This movie is pretty slow but intriguing.  It is the type of movie that could open a lot of discussion afterwards and I am sure that this could be a good film-English project for a University course.  I give it just under four stars.",1162771200,5,2461,4.504504504504505
185427,4,1563311976,"Gwyneth Paltrow returns to high drama after experimenting with some other material.  A highly respected actress she finds her niche in this role with no trouble.  She played the part on stage and obviously has it down cold.

The story starts with her character seeing visions of her father (Sir Anthony Hopkins) who recently died.  He was a brilliant mathematician who slipped into mental illness for a short time.  He recovered briefly but then regressed back.  During his regression and before his death, the two of them, sharing the same intellect, spoke of doing the greatest Proof ever.

The main idea of the story is her fear of inheriting her fathers mental illness.  Particularly when it looks like she may have tried to plagiarize his work.  Her sister does not make it easier due to her thinking she slipping away as well, just as their father did.  She attempts to take control of her life and get her the `help' she needs.

The performances in this movie are top notch.  Paltrow proves once again she has range beyond many of her peers.  Gyllenhaal continues to gain notoriety with strong roles like this and Brokeback mountain, making him one of the best young actors out there as well.  And there's always Sir Anthony Hopkins, reliable as ever, giving an outstanding performance.  The chemistry between him and Paltrow is the best thing about the movie.

Although the dramatic element draws on the `Proof', it's mostly just a shell of a reason to get these characters together for the performances that they give.  Underneath the drama is something of an empty shell.  We don't really care about the Proof and it could be emphasized a little less.  But in any case, it is an integral part of the story.",1161302400,7,1716,4.736486486486487
185428,4,1563311976,"`Proof' plays out with a lot of similarities to the brilliant `A Beautiful Mind', but it approaches its subject differently enough to make it its own film and not a carbon copy of success.  Adapted from the play of the same name, `Proof' covers the week following the death of brilliant yet mentally disturbed mathematician Robert (Hopkins).  His youngest daughter Catherine (Paltrow) had been taking care of him for the past five years, sacrificing her dreams of higher education to watch after her lonely and dying father.  After his death she has to deal with his ex-student Hal (Gyllenhaal) who is searching through Roberts notebooks in order to find proof that even in his insanity he was still brilliant as well as her sister Claire (Davis) who never gave either of them the time of day but is determined to help now that their father is dead.

What makes this film memorable is the layered performances by the entire cast.  Gwyneth gives a very structured performance, giving us varying degrees of emotions and unraveling her characters inner workings to us gradually.  Anthony Hopkins is such a wonderful treat here, truly mesmerizing, and Hope Davis takes the whole unsympathetic sister role to the next level.  I truly hated her even though I'm convinced she didn't mean any harm.  To me Jake Gyllenhaal is really stepping up to plate.  He had an amazing year last year with three brilliant performances, one of which lead him to an Oscar nomination (all three of his roles, from Brokeback Mountain to Proof to Jarhead were wonderfully layered and all three different from the next making him a true cinematic chameleon).  Although his character is minimal in this film he really commands the screen while he's on and makes for a wonderful treat.

While I'm not a mathematician, nor do I even understand half of what made the characters in this film so smart (all that talk of proofs and primes goes right over my head) one can still be enthralled by the underlying and motivating factor to this film.  This is a film about grief and acceptance, especially of ones self, and realizing that we are all capable of great things.  As Catherine deals with the loss of her father whom she no doubt loved very much she also is faced with the idea that she may very well have not only inherited his genius but also his dementia.  And when those closest to you are convinced you're following in his downward spiral you begin to believe in the possibility, almost convincing yourself of what you are certain could never be.  While not as brilliant or emotionally abrasive as `A Beautiful Mind', `Proof' still works hard to strike the right chords, and thanks to impressive performances by the entire cast it hits most of them right on the head.",1161302400,6,2744,4.7594936708860756
185429,4,1563311976,"Beautiful and mysterious '{Proof}' takes the lives of two math geniuses, a professor at the University of Chicago, Robert (Anthony Hopkins), and his aspiring student daughter, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Both are gifted and both suffer from mental illness.  Ingeniously, we see the movie from inside Catherine's fragmented consciousness.  Her perception of scrambled time with memories that are elusive makes us passengers inside her struggling mind.  She is his caretaker, but she assumes the independence (and talent) to go to Northwestern and materialize her education.  In the meantime, her father has died, which shatters all the time frames.  Sister Claire (Hope Davis) comes from New York to the funeral.  We find her an irritating presence, but she is intriguing.  Is she thoughtful to Catherine or not?  Everything from shampoo conditioner to funeral arrangements is taxing for Catherine--and it shows. She finds some needed love and reassurance from her father's understudy, Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), and this is where the split comes between audience and protagonist.  Paranoid, she suspects he is some opportunist trying to feed upon her and her father's legacy.  Although even her suspicions are logical.

The film posts some important questions for us to ponder.  How crazy was Robert during his lifetime?  How much of a genius?  And, especially how much do these two dynamics fit in for Catherine?  She doesn't know herself.  It is hard for Catherine to sort out the truth from fiction in her scattered consciousness, but she finds out the truth, and so do we.  The way the story is presented is fascinating and emotionally rewarding.  Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Auburn.  Kudos for director John Madden, who gets us into Catherine's skin, taking advantage of film in a way that the theatre can't.  '{Proof}' is sometimes a beautifully heartbreaking film with revelations that are poignantly presented.

185430,5,1563311976,"John Madden and Gwyneth Paltrow first collaborated on ""Shakespeare in Love,"" one of the most intelligent, lush romantic comedies of all time.  They reunite to make a completely different kind of magic in ""Proof,"" a film adaptation of a wildly popular play in which Paltrow also played the lead.

""Proof"" is steeped in the culture of mathematic academia, where words like ""proof"" are used with hallowed reverence, and the leading figures are considered to be gods by the ""mere"" professors and grad students.  Paltrow plays Katherine, younger daughter to a mathematical genius (Anthony Hopkins), who ""revolutionized the field twice before he turned 26.""  But Dad recently died after a long mental illness, and Katherine put her own academic life on hold to care for her dottering old man as they rattle around their big Chicago house together.  Katherine insists that Dad has some lucid times where he was working again, working on something great . . . could it be found in the hundreds of notebooks Dad left behind in his study?

Grad student Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) is plowing through the books as fast as he can.  (One has to suspend a little disbelief here, believing that any university has lookers like Paltrow and Gyllenhall in the same math department.)  Hal and Katherine also have a bit of a thing going, but both of them move with the caution bred from working too close for too long a time.  I've never really been a fan of Gyllenhaal before ""Proof,"" but he gives a sincere, restrained performance that is just perfect.

And then there's Claire (Hope Davis), Katherine's older sister, who has flown in from New York to help out.  Claire has clearly abandoned mathematics as a career and has moved on to more practical, lucrative pursuits (although her job is never explained).  Claire has the disadvantage of being a merely ""talented"" person born into a family of geniuses, and it's pretty clear that she's got plenty of her own issues.  Davis, giving yet another fine performance, conveys much of Claire's repressed frustration with brittle mannerisms and inflections, but neverteless she conveys a lot.

But Paltrow is the true shining light here.  Far from the radiant beauty she plays in virtually every film, Paltrow here is haggard, worn thin by her years of caring for Dad and also the worry that she might be ""like him"" in both good ways and bad.  It's pretty clear that every character Plus, she's carrying a secret.  Either she has gone beyond her father's genius and discovered a new proof that had eluded the old guy, or she has stolen his work and tried to pass it off as her own.  Paltrow, one of the sunniest of actresses, here comes of as believable as a soul in torment.

This is a ""little film,"" clocking in at 90 minutes and with a tightly focused plot and cast.  That doesn't mean that it isn't excellent.  Along with ""Wonder Boys"" and ""The Squid and the Whale,"" ""Proof"" stands firmly in the short line of recent fantastic movies about academics and academia.  Check it out.",1159920000,4,3003,4.77906976744186
185431,4,1563311976,"Gwyneth Paltrow is Catherine, a young mathematician who is the daughter of Robert, a legendary mathematician ruined by mental illness and played by Anthony Hopkins.  The lives of mathematicians revolve around their ability to craft coherent answers, or proofs for elaborate mathematical questions.  Few mathematicians successfully and single-handedly arrive at a significant proof in their careers and, as ""Proof"" suggests, most mathematicians hit their peak in their mid-twenties.  Robert managed the first hurdle, but as to the second - his life degenerated into an existence trapped in a house of math books and notebooks riddled with incomprehensible figures.  Catherine, having dropped out of school to care for her father, already wonders if she's destined to suffer the same life of mental illness as her father.  She ""loses"" time, and endures spates of depression that keep her bedridden for days.  However, when she's up and about, her sometimes lucid father engages her in number games, and urges her to work on proofs while out of school - he himself suddenly feels competent enough to work out a new proof, one which will compensate for years wasted looking for alien messages in Dewey-Decimal codes at the local library.  Mathematics is both home and prison for all mathematicians - it's absorbing, and those steeped in its ways find themselves undone trying to rely on it to explore and explain their reality.  And when a possibly groundbreaking proof is found in one of Robert's many notebooks the script turns into a battle of wills between Catherine who claims to have written it, and Claire who thinks that Catherine is using the proof to hold onto a bleak existence in Chicago where she will follow her father's path into madness.

Robert is already dead when ""Proof"" starts, and we only meet him in flashbacks that hint at both his and his daughter's sanity.  In the ""present"", in the aftermath of Robert's death, Catherine must deal with Harold ""Hal"" Dobbs (Gylenhaal), a young mathematician who may represent Robert's opposite - sane but also mediocre.  Hal loves her, or maybe he's in love with being the boyfriend of the daughter of a legendary mathematician, and he's obsessed with finding the shreds of a master-proof buried in hundreds of notebook pages of scribbles.  Then there's Claire (Hope Davis), Catherine's older sister, an established financial analyst in Manhattan (the story is set in Chicago).  One of the best scenes in the flick (and easily the funniest in what's not quite a laugh-riot movie) is the first meeting of Hal & Claire.  Already beginning to suspect that Catherine is well on the road to emotional instability, Claire drills Catherine on details about Hal - always referring to him by his full name, as if he were a delusion of Catherine and needed first and last name to ground him in reality.  In the next scene - driving up to Catherine's and finding Hal already there, Claire points at him with angry vindication - ""Harold - Briggs!!"".  (The script slyly suggests that Claire may be at least as insane as her father, but found in her job and home an existence that accommodates her mental state.)  When the disputed ""proof"" is first found, Harold becomes the battleground between Claire and Catherine - the older sister convinced that their father found lucidity before his death to author a last heuristic hurrah.

This was a great film, though largely on its performances - the story itself seems unfinished, with a too-pat ending.  I never thought much of Gylenhaal, though he's incredibly mature if befuddled by Catherine (if you didn't like ""The Good Girl"" because of him, he's still great here).  The deft script makes him a cutting composite of a man who genuinely feels for Catherine while also being exactly what Catherine hates about mathematicians - geeks who hit their peak early and spend the rest of their lives bragging about conferences they attend, playing in horrible rock bands, poking holes in the proofs of others and paving the way for the next generation of mathematicians.  Hope Davis makes the most out of Catherine's extremely unlikable sister, in a script that has little patience for her.  The movie of course belongs to Paltrow who seems to be both fighting a losing battle for sanity and fighting off those who might try to rescue her from it - it's her least ""Hollywood"" performance, prickly and unfriendly yet oddly beguiling.  Catherine has already learned that math is a prison, but spends the rest of the story trying to find something other than the disputed proof to save her from that cell.",1158883200,,4585,4.956919060052219
185432,2,1563311976,"I don't know how ""Proof"" worked on stage, but for me it just did not work well on film. Tedious is the word that keeps coming to my mind to describe how I felt as I watched it. I endured it, hoping minute after minute to begin enjoying it.",1158105600,3,239,3.8979591836734695
185433,4,1563311976,"Having seen the play (with Liza Weil as Catherine, using the same unique tone --melancholic/bitter/superior/anxious-- of voice that she uses on ""Gilmore Girls""), I thought the movie would only be mediocre. Instead, I really enjoyed it. Such a contrast in characters, especially between Catherine and her older sister. I loved the scene on the porch when her sister is asking her if she tried the shampoo she bought for her. ""It's supposed to make your hair healthy,"" she tells her.

""Hair's dead,"" Catherine replies.

But the sister goes on and on about how great it is, it's organic (""but organics can be chemicals,"" notes Catherine) and blah blah blah. So true. It's amazing how her sister can go on and on about such irrelevant things.

Grrrr to those who were skeptical that a young WOMAN could solve difficult proofs. Viewers can see how tough it is to live in the shadow of a genius parent (or sibling, for that matter - her sister was ""successful"" in her own way). It's rare for other people to accept you at (and above) that genius level, but sometimes it works the other way; if you have an older sibling who excels in some area, others might expect you to be just as smart.

But mostly, I think that if Catherine had been male, it would have been easier for many to view her as the legitimate author of the proof.

Hopkins was excellent. I'm never too thrilled with Paltrow, but she was ok for this one - though it was harder for me to accept her as a math genius at the start of the movie. By the end, I felt that she was somewhat on that level, but I think I replaced her with Liza Weil's exquisite, intelligent depression in my imagination.",1156377600,7,1653,4.496666666666667

I loved Gwenyth's portrayal of a daughter that loved her father so much that she felt it was her responsibility to take care of him even though she was sacrificing her own life. The story was right on the money as far as being how those situations go sometimes in life. The sister who came into town for the funeral and tried to be bossy and pushy was also very true to life.

But it was obvious to me she was just exhausted and suffering a nervous breakdown. Who wouldn't after dealing for five years with a father who is that difficult to deal with? And why shouldn't she be full of rage when you have a sister who was too selfish to help out? Being in her prime and taking care of her elderly father I can understand the rage, fear and love being so tied up together you feel crazy.

This is a story about family bonds and stratospheric genius. It's coming to grips of who you are. It's also letting go and paradoxically embracing who and what you are and who and what you can be.",1154563200,3,930,4.406976744186046
185447,5,1563311976,"As a former acting student, I'd like to concentrate on what I liked about the performances of the

four lead actors in {PROOF}.

Gwyneth Paltrow, as Catherine, plays the daughter of a genius father who has recently died.  Her sense of loss after caring for him for the previous five years, and her fear that she might have inherited his insanity colors Paltrow's performance throughout.  The subtleties Gwyneth uncovers of her character's dilemma remind me of a well rehearsed symphony.  There are no wrong notes anywhere.

Anthony Hopkins, as Robert, the father, expertly portrays the agony of a brilliant man losing his ability to do his life's work.  In the hands of a less experienced actor, this could have been over-dramatically done.  But, in the hands of Hopkin's, every time he was on screen, I had just the right amount of sympathy, hope, and affection for his character.

Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Hal, Robert's zealous former student, plays this multifaceted character with all the uncertainty inherent in his desire to bring glory to his former professor, satisfy his desire for Catherine, help her solve her dilemma, and finally to bring glory to his own career.  Gyllenhaal is one of those actors that in theater terms is someone who has stage presence in spades. I have to watch everything he does and says on film.

Hope Davis, as Claire, Catherine's sister, plays the over-confidant, irritatingly organized, much-too-late to be really helpful sibling to perfection.  From the minute she shows up, I'm turned off, and as I see that she and Catherine's personalities mix like vinegar and water, I despise her character more and more, but was forced when the film was over to admit, ""Wow, she did that really well.""",1154304000,8,1731,4.951557093425605
185448,5,1563311976,"Proof boasts prize-winning source material and an excellent cast. What more can one ask for?

The film stayed very true to the original stage play, telling the tale of a young woman named Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow), who dropped out of college to care for Robert, her mentally ill father (Anthony Hopkins) who also happens to be a famous mathematician. After Robert passes away, Catherine (already a little socially awkward), is lost, rambling around his old house by herself. Graduate student Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) requests her permission to sift through the copious notebooks that Robert produced during his decline, hoping to find the next mathematical breakthrough in their pages. Catherine assents, and the two begin a tentative relationship. When Catherine points Hal to a locked drawer in her father's study, he is thrilled to discover a very important, groundbreaking proof that he immediately attributes to her father. When Catherine divulges that she herself wrote it, both Hal and her estranged sister Claire (Hope Davis), who has flown from New York to Chicago to attend the funeral, doubt her assertion. Catherine already fears that, with her father's talent for math, she has also inherited his tendency towards madness. She reacts strongly to the betrayal, and Hal must try to prove that he does have faith in her.

What's interesting about the script is that the audience doesn't know until the end just which of the characters to believe. Did Catherine write the proof, or did she steal it from her ailing father? Did her father still have possession of his faculties in his decline, or was he incapable of writing the proof? Is Hal sticking around because he really likes Catherine, or does he want her to let her guard down just enough to allow him to make off with the mathematical prize he's looking for? This tension makes the film (and the play) work. The material's no slouch. David Auburn won both a Pulitzer and a Tony for the play this film is based on.

All the performances in this film were very strong. Paltrow particularly shined, rendering Catherine as shy, awkward, and afraid of her own potential talent/madness. I thought her treatment of the character was very original; I haven't seen her perform in a role like this before. She played this same role to stellar reviews on Broadway, and her reprisal of Catherine in the film is delicate and layered. I really enjoyed her.",1154044800,10,2409,4.94320987654321

We saw this late one evening after being tired enough to be put into Dreamland... FAR FROM IT! It was an engrossing story of the great irascible mathematician Father enacted by Sir Anthony Hopkins. His daughters were fearful of him and for his loss of life and his good rational mind. I surely identified with his plight in my own personal history.

This is a fascinating and intelligent drama.  I found it difficult to follow due to so much of the story being told in flashbacks.  In many ways, due to Hopkins's excellent acting, the flashbacks were far more real than the storyline they were trying to portray in current time.

185452,5,1563311976,"""Proof"" is one of the most intelligent movies I have ever seen.
It is the story of a mathematical genius (Anthony Hopkins) who has developed schitzophrenia in his later years,and his Daughter(Gwenyth Paltrow) who cares for him during his ongoing illness.

While everyone who comes in contact with him sees a crazy man, on the inside of his gifted mind he is solving a mathamatical proof that has eluded mathmaticians for years...or so we think.

The Father dies, and
only the Daughter knows of his work, until she gives it to her boyfriend (Jake Gyllenhaal)as a sort of gift, as he knew her Father well, and was one of his students.
She later confesses that SHE wrote the proof, and we are taken through flashbacks of when her Father was alive, to see who after all wrote this groundbreaking equation. We find out in a very revealing unforgettable way, when the Father reads his out loud.

His ""proof"" is nothing but a bunch of gibber-jabber that makes absolutely NO sense. -something about the months of the years and so forth.
After being forced by her father to read it out loud, Her heart breaks for her him, because he is so senile, and she puts HER proof in HIS drawer, and locks it, and there it stays until she retrives it and gives it to Jake Gylenhaal.

Another drama that plays out in this movie is that the Daughter thinks she is also mentally ill like her Father, and will end up like him.

 Hope Davis, who plays her sister also believes that her sister is crazy, too.
I, myself, did not believe her to be crazy at all, only a little lonely, and isolated from caring for her father, yet the worry about it plagues her.

I have read some of the other reviews where people say this movie was so confusing. I think it made perfect sense the first viewing. The flashbacks were merely to explain the mysteries,not put there to confuse.

This movie makes you question if there is any truth to the belief that there is a thin line between genius, and maddness. This movie is based on the pulitzer prize winning play, and is well worth renting, or better yet, adding to your collection...You WILL want to own it.",1149292800,9,2118,4.497395833333333

They all play a vital role involving Paltrow's character who feels she is insane like her deceased math genius father (Hopkins). Her character struggles for sanity after the death of her much-respected father. Gyllenhaal's character is a former student of Hopkins and Davis plays Paltow's older sister. I like the ending, how the credits start to flow across the screen before the last scene is even done. Intelligent, low-key film. Check it out some time.",1149206400,4,720,5.324561403508772
185454,5,1563311976,"There's a wonderful moment late in Proof where Catherine, Gwyneth Paltrow, says sadly to Hal, Jake Gyllenhaal, ""I think I'm like my father.""  Hal, beaming, says, ""You are.""

What is so marvelous about this exchange is that both statements are correct, but the interaction is a case study in flawed data interpretation.  Catherine means that she's afraid she is mad, like her father.  Indeed there is evidence enough that at the very least she is emotionally fragile and will succumb to serious mental illness at some point.  But Hal is looking right through her fears, he means that she is like her father in that she is a brilliant mathematician.  Ironically it is perhaps the latter of the two possibilities that causes Catherine greater fear.

The other spellbinding moment is when she finally reads her father's great proof out loud to him, as he demands.  Without spoiling it I'll just say that this brief scene illustrates the essential truth of the movie so powerfully that it is breathtaking.

Proof was originally a play, so the emphasis is on dialogue, beat, structure, nuance, and revelation.  Director Madden also gave us Shakespeare In Love, with Paltrow, so you know from the start you are in for a quality production.  Jake Gyllenhaal is faultless as a young man fearlessly going where a wiser man would not, because Paltrow's Catherine, while beguiling, is trouble.  This is perhaps the movie's greatest power, and Paltrow gives the best performance I've ever seen her give.

Catherine is a woman of contradictions, strong yet brittle, selfless yet self-absorbed, generous yet resentful, brash yet timid.  She maintains this highly nuanced state throughout the film, and even though we cannot understand her, (as she cannot understand herself), frequently become impatient with her, wonder if she put herself in the role of victim in order to wallow in it and use it as a weapon against others, we never stop caring about her and hoping she'll be all right.

This is a slightly different Paltrow, a little older, a little tougher, and her performance is incredibly confident - really a pleasure.  About Anthony Hopkins what can one say, he is such a fire horse that at this point he must carry around a handful of performances like this in his hip pocket at all times - that said, he is absolutely on target.

The sleeper in this movie is Hope Davis as Claire, Catherine's sister.  She is Catherine's anti-matter, and their confrontations reveal much not just about them but also about their father.  With her ""To-Do"" lists, which she neatly checks off, her clipped speech, and precise thoughts about Catherine's future, Claire is the Uber-Yuppie from heck we all fear.  The irony is that once we get beyond our initial dread we see that she has some valid points.  Even the most elegant solution must be tested, Claire helps.

The characters are interesting. The dialog, especially between the daughter and her father is always at multiple levels. The conversations interweave logic, math, and interpersonal concerns. My favorite part is where the Anthony's character (the father) encourages Gwenyth's character to stop moping and start working. He uses the properties of the number 1729 to good effect.

The movie is a little slow and predictable so I knocked a star off. If you didn't have a tie into it like ""math"" or Chicago, I could see where it could drag. The flashbacks are supposed to be slightly confusing. She's having problems with the death of her father and her mental states. I didn't understand the criticisms of the other reviewers of the movie based on the flashbacks. Some of the confusion was intentional.

I think that this was the director's intention. You are supposed to be wondering throughout most of the movie who wrote the proof, and has the daughter inherited her brilliant father's insanity?

Luckily, I have the DVD, so I was able to listen to the director's commentary, which clears up exactly what he was trying to get across in the movie.

The first time I watched the move, there were too many scenes which did not quite make sense. I had difficulty understanding the character motivations in places. This is a drama with a lot of emotions swirling about, and I think it is difficult to make sense of it in one viewing of the movie.

I give this 3 stars because if you buy the DVD, you can watch it multiple times and gain a better understanding with each viewing. I think the themes of the movie are interesting.

185467,2,1563311976,"Given its cast, pedigree and subject matter, ""Proof"" is a surprisingly minor, insignificant picture, clever and moving on a Lifetime Channel frequency, but thin and immature otherwise. Adapted by David Auburn and Rebecca Miller from Auburn's Pultizer Prize-winning play, it suffers from arch, rat-a-tat dialogue that works on stage but drones onscreen, and most painfully predictable casting that finds Anthony Hopkins as a mad genius, Gwyneth Paltrow as a melancholy girl, and Hope Davis as another bossy shrew. To the well, to the well, to the well - and now the water's tepid and soot-ridden.

Paltrow is Catherine, an amateur mathematician wilting under the smothering pressure of sister Claire (Davis) and the memory of just-buried father Robert (Hopkins), a Chicago University professor who, like some mathematicians, made landmark discoveries in his early 20s, coasted on tenure, and then slowly went insane. Director John Madden only reveals glimpses of Robert's downward spiral before his death through Catherine's harsh eulogy at his funeral; the movie is more occupied with Catherine's struggle to cut her own figure in life when she shares her father's talents. Especially when one of her Robert's old students, Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) discovers a brilliant proof that Catherine claims to have written, then

locked away out of respect - and fear.

Because the answer to this mystery is obvious whether you've seen the play or not - let it be said it is the less interesting of the two possibilities - ""Proof"" must churn its pleasures from performance and direction, both of which are uninspired. Madden prefers pretty to intense, and so a play entirely comprised of interiors is opened up to the towering Chicago oaks and softly falling snow. Dust is caught only when dancing in a concentrated sunbeam.

Paltrow plays Catherine as a whiny waif, while Davis kneads the exact same dough she has for years. Hopkins, as Robert, is asked to assume an odd role - that of an insane man whose insanity is alluded to but never shown. ""Proof"" focuses on his blustery ""lucid"" year between manic episodes, and leaves no explanation for the descent, apparently preferring we watch ""A

Beautiful Mind"" and borrow the life arc of John Forbes Nash. Catherine and Claire's mother is not mentioned, strange for characters reflecting on the death of one parent.

And the movie speaks incessantly of math without ever dissecting any of its meaning. What's a creative proof? How do new and old methodologies differ? Auburn and Miller supply the words - Madden neglects the music. The characters should talk in a vacuum. The audience should not see in one.",1147824000,3,2645,5.096997690531178

The plot was severely lacking and the acting was unenjoyable.  Most of the movie consisted of Paltrow's character (Katie) bickering with another actor/actress.  Not even worth the watch.",1146096000,4,426,4.6891891891891895
185470,5,1563311976,"By reading some of the previous reviews, I get the feeling that some people may have been disappointed by the fact that the plot of the movie is somewhat simple. This is not an adventure movie; it is a character study, a journey into genius and madness, the complexity of family ties, and of relationships growing from intellectual and sentimental attraction. Some call it a thriller and I agree with that. It is a thriller to people who like sensible movies.

The performances of lead and supporting cast members are flawless, believable and touching. Gwyneth Paltrow delivers a performance that I find much more admirable and challenging than the one in ""Shakespeare in Love"", and if I had to choose, I'd give her the Oscar for this one which I found much more interesting by all means.

Jake Gyllenhaal makes an adorable Hal (even when you wonder about his motives); his confident performance rings absolutely true (he must be every geek's hero now!). Sir Hopkins is his own, usual perfect self.

Hope Davis' character is truly irritating, so I guess she does a great job.

Interestingly, ""Proof"" does not deliver one single breathtaking moment to replay over and over. It is not ""memorable"" that way. It is the mood of the whole movie that sticks with you. Dialogues can be quite funny at times (the ""jojoba"" lines are funny and the ""dating the doctoral advisor's daughter"", very sweet), and I actually found the ""theatrical"" sound of them pleasant and interesting.

The editing work is excellent; the flashbacks are carefully spread out through the movie to help build-up and understand the complexity of the ""present"". If anybody finds the succession of past and present scenes confusing, one must consider that maybe there is a relevance to that. The main character is confused and has lived in confusion for several years, to a point where she is afraid to be ""like her father."" And she is not thinking about his genius when she says that...

This movie is delicate and sensitive; it will still be as true and interesting as it is now in ten or fifteen years from now. It has timeless qualities.",1146009600,9,2103,4.795580110497237
185471,2,1563311976,"PROOF must have demonstrated higher power in its successful Broadway run than in the mild drama on view here.  The acting can't be faulted, exactly (although a case could certainly be made for Paltrow's nasal whine as the most irritating star voice since Liz Taylor's breathless baby-doll gurgle of the 60's and 70's -- surely her unquestionable ability's not well served by roles like this, or SYLVIA, where she has to complain endlessly).  The problem's the script.  By now, the central situation's probably known to most audiences going in, which leaves a long, static first act of exposition to arrive at a singularly unsurprising curtain line.  Once the conflict's established, the action plods like clockwork to an entirely predictable conclusion.  No incidental felicities of soaring language or intriguing character tics to provide interest along the way.  Despite the star power on display, and pedigree of the script, PROOF plays like a Lifetime movie-of-the-week, with slighly higher production values.  A major disappointment.",1145923200,3,1038,5.409937888198757
185472,3,1563311976,"As the movie starts, I was struck by its stagey quality. First Paltrow declaims; then Hopkins declaims. In the DVD commentary, I learned that this movie was in fact adapted from a stage play in which Paltrow also starred. I had somehow missed knowing about the existence of that originating stage play, but was glad to be proven right in my instincts about how these movie characters were projecting. The acting gets a little more fluid and natural as the movie progresses, but never completely loses its staged quality.

Other aspects of this movie are artsy and artificial. For example, Hopkins' schizophrenia doesn't look like the schizophrenia of anyone I've known diagnosed with the condition. Hopkins' schizophrenia is played strictly to the balcony.

Paltrow's character, while meant to be sympathetic, actually comes off as being adamant at the wrong moments, over-the-top shrill at the wrong moments, then pliant and self-doubting at the wrong moments. I began to lose interest in her when she brimmed with such loud indigation over the police coming to her door and wanting to question her - after she had CALLED them reporting a burglary in progress!

Again in the DVD commentary, Director John Madden congratulates himself and everone involved in this project on creating such nuanced characters. He cites Paltrow's sister as an example of the triumph of nuance over stereotype. However, I found Paltrow's sister to be a completely stereotypical villainess. She has no redeeming virtues. She is a social wasp. The commentary is apt when Madden says her actions remind him of key Shakespearean scenes. She is like the MacBeth play-within-a-play wherein the murderers pour poison into the King's ear. She is Iago, whispering tragic lies into Othello's ear. She goes crisply on her way, scratching people, along with errands, off her ""to-do"" list. And she doesn't change or grow as the action progresses. She will continue ticking down her list to the end.

Jake Gyllenhaal is the only truly likeable, sympathetic character in this movie. He is the kind of friend everyone might wish to have. His developing bond with Paltrow is what holds this movie together and makes it worthwhile.

As for the math - I wish there were MORE of it. The audience never really gets a feel for the importance of any math study here. All we get is the too-often repeated pronouncement that it's all over for a math thinker by the age of 22. But what about the math itself? We really don't get an inkling of what Paltrow has proven or failed to prove. And making the rudaments of a math idea available to a popular audience is possible, as shown by the TV series ""Numbers."" I was hoping there would be more Numbers in here, and less histrionics. There may be form in this movie, but there just isn't enough function.",1145664000,7,2805,4.8844537815126055

185474,4,1563311976,"It's easy to dismiss ""Proof"" as a ""Beautiful Mind 2.""  But it's a film that has stayed with me and left a lasting impression.  For me, that's an indication of quality.

Director John Madden (""Capt. Corelli's Mandolin) re-unites with the star Gwyneth Paltrow from 1998's ""Shakespeare in Love"" that resulted in a Best Director nomination for him and a Best Actress Oscar for her.  Paltrow got glowing reviews for her performance as Catherine in David Auburn's play on the West End stage in London.  The mathematics-laden premise translates fairly well to screen.

At times we are confused.  First, it seems that Anthony Hopkins is real and helping his daughter celebrate her birthday.  Then we learn through her dialogue with Jake Gyllenhaal's character Hal that Catherine's father was a brilliant mathematician who suffered from mental illness and has died.  Gyllenhaal who came off a very hot year with an Oscar nomination for ""Brokeback Mountain"" and a lead performance in ""Jarheads"" seems very likeable here.  Even so, we're unsure if he's using Catherine or if he's cultivating a relationship.

There was a little film called ""The Secret Life of Dentists"" that starred Hope Davis as a dentist having an affair.  She gave a complex albeit less than likeable performance, much as she does here as Claire, Catherine's sister who is persuaded that like their dad, Catherine is also losing her mind.  With films like ""The Daytrippers"" & ""Next Stop Wonderland,"" she's creating an interesting body of work.

Although there are some strange notes in the film such as Hal's band that seems to invade their party, it's the relationships between the characters that make the film memorable.  A daughter's connection to her father that is strong can inspire her for a lifetime.  Seeing Catherine discover her own brilliance and come to believe it is also quite moving.  This was a little film that our local cinema refused to bring here to the large screen.  It's well worth investigating on DVD.  Enjoy!",1145232000,7,1995,5.009118541033435
185485,5,1563311976,"This movie successfully transitions a great play into a great movie. There are three keys to this success: a beautiful script, an incredibly gifted lead actress, and a director who knows how to sustain the energy of a film from scene to scene, beginning to end. Other reviews have outlined the story, so I won't waste space with another rehash. Besides, the story line is not the essence of the movie. Paltrow gives her best performance of her career, and that is saying something. The story itself catches a whiff of doing mathematics, which is a pretty difficult thing to put on the screen. I especially liked the way Jake Gyllenhaal's character wavered between the obvious fact that Katherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) really had proven the stunning result that the movie revolves around and his obvious ambition to prove his own mettle as a budding mathematician. Mathematicians are at once extremely collegial and extremely ambitious. The script and Gyllenhaal's execution hit just the right tone. Since this is the 58th review of this movie here at Amazon, I won't stretch this out. Know that this fine movie has been carefully transferred to the DVD medium. The film is intense, lean, crackling with energy, fast, endearing -- it made me love mathematics all over again.",1145145600,8,1269,4.962441314553991
185486,2,1563311976,"Proving or disproving something is the goal of many mathematicians. But PROOF takes that equation into an entirely different dynamic. Gwyneth Paltrow (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998) as Catherine gives the best performance of all in this ensemble cast. She's the daughter of a genius (Anthony Hopkins, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, 1991) who'd lost his mind and recently died. But his brilliance was legendary. His equations changed mathematical history. And when Catherine appears to be just as brilliant as her father, her fears drive her to extremes. She feels she may be losing her mind, too, so she hides her intellect behind a mask of despair, longing for her lost father. Behind this facade we see her own battle with depression and her worries that she may be too much like her father. Will she end up just as mad as he? This is the question that eats at Catherine throughout the story.

Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) plays Hal, the love interest, as well as a math student trying to come up with his own proof (i.e. mathematical breakthrough). He's pouring over Catherine's father's final papers, trying to determine if there was anything of value left in his fractured mind just before his death. And when Catherine gives him a key to the desk, Jake uncovers what could be a discovery of monumental importance. But who wrote it? The father ...or the daughter?

Hope Davis (THE MATADOR, 2005) stars as Claire, Catherine's distant sister who returns to town to help bury their father and to tick Catherine off of her ""to-do list."" She was the other shining star in the film, acting as a neurotically classic type-A personality.

______________________________________________________________________________

Although PROOF held my interest, it's impact on me was negligible. There was no ""hallelujah"" moment where everything fit together or where an actor or actress did something extraordinary. They just ...were.

The pacing of the film was pretty laid back, too. Director John Madden seemed in no particular hurry to get a resolution to the audience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But for a ""family dynamic"" film, there could've (should've) been something more gripping that held my interest.

I will say that the picture was acted and shot well. Just not ""very"" well. Anthony Hopkins was just Anthony Hopkins, for instance.

Psychology students might eat this story up, but for the general population it may fall pretty flat.",1144800000,,2445,5.112781954887218

My mistake, as this movie was entirely captivating. Despite its potentially polarizing subject matter (advanced mathematics), PROOF delivered the goods on all counts. Each of the four principal actors is excellent, producing a sum greater than the individual parts. Special kudos to Hope Davis as a yuppie with considerable and misguided energy, and to the excellent Gwyneth Paltrow, who is not afraid to look un-glamorous.

The story develops with plenty of unexpected twists; thus, despite its subject, it is anything BUT formulaic. (Hey, a math joke!) A truly terrific film.",1144540800,7,760,5.325

Beautifully nuanced performance by Gwyneth Paltrow (Gyllenhall and Hopkins are good, too, but Paltrow is the show). Taken together with her appearances in ""Bounce,"" ""Emma,"" ""Sylvia,""and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" among many others, this provides strong evidence that she is one of the best actresses ever.",1144368000,5,673,5.607843137254902
185489,4,1563311976,"Outstanding performances, riveting, winding and weaving through family crisis centered on a deceased, enigmatic father figure.  I can't give away any more than that.  But there is a story about mathematical discovery here, not a bad one; and contrary to what other reviewers have assumed, there are mathematical anecdotes, some proof, the details we're left imagining belong to any number of questions that have been asked about the prime numbers.  That is secondary, this movie is about a struggle between the dramatized popular mythos of intellectual productivity; and the catastrophe of American anti-intellectualism.  Again, a movie is a byproduct of culture, working people in a contemporary setting who's creative output engenders their own misperceptions--it is not a documentary about mathematics, and the movie construct in consumer idolatry doesn't presume to play umpire:  that's a fair criticism, that's a foul ball etc.  It's never been just entertainment, it is a medium constantly issuing templates for our common values, presentations weak, true or false about the way people think about and accept reality.  Now since that is an irresistible temptation to manufacture, such is the news and public perception of real events, a movie is a commodity which can't be taken at face value--as much as its commercial backing would want us to.  On this point, Proof never made it to the local theater here, and then even major chain video rental/retail weren't carrying it.

I had an opportunity a while back, to ask why the movie never came to town, the ticket gal used her walkie-talkie to ask her manager as she tore our tickets for a different movie.  The man said it wasn't a decision of the theater's, that it all happened and went down in corporate skyscrapers far away.  The mandate:  No one would be interested in a story like that, about mathematics of all things.  Then I stumbled on it in the other store of a well known video rental on the other end of town, rented it and watched it on a Macintosh G4 with great anticipation.  I'd practically made a list of important things to look for, if and when I'd ever get the chance to see it. I can't watch movies on my Winbook XL2 anymore, Microsoft failed me and took away my DVD decoder, even on a Win'98 reformatting.  Maybe I should write to them:  `Thanks for breaking my DVD, there has been no custodianship of consumer reliability-(hock spoot).'  Zero backward compatibility, neither Win'98 or Win'XP will let a less complicated, 16 bit startup.exe file perform its humble task, reinstalling the decoder that was shipped on a CD.  I bet you can't even get that first tv tennis game with the sliding barriers and square ball to work on these things.  What isn't true in mathematics, is that we can throw away our early understanding and ways of thinking about the science.  We can't forget basic addition, nor the heuristics to long division with paper and pencil...though there is some interest in ridding the public school K-12 curriculum of that...and in logic of implication, we cannot, under any circumstances do what is called `denial of the antecedent'.  That is effectively walking away from the argument ipso facto, not `straight on through the argument.'  Andrew Wiles did not therefore prove nor go anywhere near Fermat's Last Theorem.  He tried to deny the Fry antecedent corollary to his elliptic modularity work.  Since everybody at the time was too bamboozled to see straight, it was never caught.

I did see a copy of Annals of Mathematics in this movie, happy to report.  Gwennyth's gorgeous.

Now, we might ask why there are only two valid forms of modal implication:  ponens and tollens, each preceded by the Latin term `modus'--just like `modus operandi'.  This would require a level of analysis actually above the sentential logic, a meta-logic.  Well, we know you can't drive down a one way street going in the opposite direction, and when there's a sign that says `right turn only', we have to follow that rule too.  The logic of proof is like a system of traffic rules, and they are routinely violated by the hot air community.  Since the rest of society has abandoned them to their play schools, they get to race around and be naughty any way they please.

A fun contemporary treatise on Logic is ""Everything that linguists have always wanted to know about Logic, but were ashamed to ask."", by James D. McCawley, University of Chicago Press, 1981; he was on the faculty of the school filmed in this movie.  I guess now we can include the shaming of the mathematicians.  He's trying to adlib some humor with his examples in that book, you have to bear with him.

There are actually a lot of books written on the mathematical procedures for `proof'.  It is a subject of fascination in its own right, (apart from mysteries of primes or whatever).  How is it we `know' a thing?  Scientists at AT&T studied Boolean disjunctive form to graph a sort of phase portrait of the Satisfiability Problem; it is like many natural phase behaviors called `critical point' phenomena.  Indeed, we do have `flashes of insight', true `Eureka' moments happen, apt description.  They've even drawn a picture of it; it does not look like the jar of mayonnaise ('Annie Hall') either...and to be honest...this movie didn't bother to work out some of its bugs with the subject, like where they meant Mersenne Primes, in the name dropping of Sophie Germain.

American films have belabored the insanity of anything mathematical as they have sold a cruel lie to young people and the more seasoned, necessarily more thorough reasoners:  that the shelf life of the ephemeral mind which must absorb more and more is less and less; therefore ignore the senile over age 22, who couldn't possibly know what they're talking about.  History has proven them wrong in many cases of career contribution over the entire life.  Ignore such ignorance at its worst, discouraging others.",1144368000,,5938,4.8998998998999

Her daughter tries the best she can to join the pieces in this intricate puzzle of formulas and theorems he left. She assumes the difficult task to further his investigations.

Behind this very painful script, I should remark the prominent acting of Gwyneth Paltrow , who must play a razor edge role between insanity and reality, to create this diffuse atmosphere that will swaddle our rational, analytical and cold logic.

The way he portrays the father who thinks he still possesses a brilliant but in fact ""out-of-order"" mind is just right to the point. Delicate as a piece of well crafted china. The casting does make it right for him. Hope Davis as Claire is as annoying as ever - the control freak sister who thought of redeeming herself through the taking over of matters from her abandoned sister, after years of avoiding caring duty of her father. Nonetheless, her affection for her sister does make up a lot to her distant approach in the past. Jake Gyllanehall as Hal could be regarded as the weaker character in the movie. Probably after Brokeback Mountain, people will expect a lot from him. Not that he is bad, but the character itself isn't as multi-layered as the other three, which in a way put him on a disadvantaged ground right from the beginning.

In all, this is a very faithful adaptation of the play and if you like the play, you will like this movie. One thing we could appreciate at least is that the director managed to turn a play that only happens in the set of a single house into a more geographically spread experience, which breathes a sense of real life into the play itself. Also scenes written to bridge different time frames and background stories were very well done as they all managed to tie into the original plot of the play. It is definitely a movie that had made good full use of the play. It's a pity that this movie was overlooked during the took over of Miramax by Disney, otherwise it would have a better standing in this year's award season.",1142812800,5,2305,4.525179856115108

Proof reiterates an observation that Nobel Prize work in the hard sciences is created in the twenties. Not so the social sciences, literature, philosophy, where wisdom accumulates with age and Nobel Prizes are awarded for the products of the later decades of life.

In science one needs to be uncompromised, unintimidated by others' beliefs, prejudices preconceptions, or their treatment of you. The scientist must think independently to contribute unique knowledge about the universe.

Once into the thirties the distractions of marriage, children, friendship, social-professional commitment (dreaded departmental meetings), mortgages, loans, bills, debts and the need to work to fit in and to survive may preclude risk taking.

The time and energy drain of obligations may suppress a drive to travel to the edges of human consciousness to extract new aesthetic insights, intellectual concepts, ways of looking at our natural and created environment.

Proof is a literate compassionate presentation of the inside of mental illness (Anthony Hopkins), the role of family and friends in the evolution of the disease or it's stablization and containment, and most importantly the impact of mental illness on the caregiver (Gwyneth Paltrow character) associated often with the sacrifice of a caregiver's life and potential contributions to become the guardian of the ill.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Caregiver-Helpbook-Powerful-Tools-for-Caregivers/dp/0978544803/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Caregiver Helpbook, Powerful Tools for Caregivers</a>&nbsp;outlines the challenges.

This film deliberately toys with its audience so we can't get a fix on whether Catherine is crazy or sane, skittish or companionable, a liar or a saint, brilliant or dull. At the end we find out, but we're given a lot of false scents until then. So maybe it works as a kind of academia thriller, but for me the thrill was gone.

To me it seems the story is more about the challenges and ethical issues surrounding the care of ill parents. How much should children be expected to sacrifice to provide a ""dignified"" life for their parents? But this story falls far short of answering that question, too.",1142467200,,781,4.578571428571428
185510,2,1563311976,"Reading many of the one-two star reviews pretty much sums up my feelings. The character development just isn't there. Anthony Hopkins, my fave actor ""ever"" is barely seen and when he is it feels like ""Instinct"" all over again. The worst part of the movie is with the ""tuh-duh"" moment (such as it is) of the movie in which the writer and director made the absolute least out of the mathematical theory written in the notebook; it just wasn't presented in a way that made it the least bit interesting to the audience. *Spoiler: And the part about the father/daughter handwriting looking the same because they spent a lot of time with each other actually made me LAUGH!

Thankfully I only rented this from Netflix, and I suggest you do the same. Proof is just a watered down version of a Beautiful Mind mixed with a high profile cast that prove sleepwalking and acting at the same time is possible.",1142208000,8,895,4.59375

Anyway this unfolds like a mystery and surrounds itself with a hint of depressed madness.  Dour sounding - but it's not.  Gyllenhall brings great energy to his scenes and Hopkins is all demented gusto.

185512,4,1563311976,"I had a psychiatry professor in medical school who advised us about recognizing depression in our patients.  ""If you start to feel depressed being around them, then they probably have depression"", we were told.  A different psychiatry professor gave us a lecture on the sometimes grey area that exists between ""genius"" and mental illness.  For example, he proposed, if modern miracle anti-depressant medications like Prozac were available, would you have treated Van Gogh - preventing him from disfiguring and ultimately killing himself, IF you knew that by treating his ""illness"" you might also be depriving him (and the world) of his ""genius"".

That is a good question that has no definitive answer.  This film explores that nebulous area `twixt genius and madness.  It also looks at relationships, trust and ""love"" between father and daughter, between sisters and between lovers.  The reason I began this review discussing how it can make you feel depressed being in the company of depressed people is that watching this movie made me feel a little depressed.

Gwyneth Paltrow stars in David Auburn's script, adapted from his play, as Anthony Hopkins' daughter, Catherine.  Hopkins' Robert was a math genius, twice making ""life-time achievement"" kind of discoveries in the field before age 27, at which time he began to become ill with a mental illness that caused him to deteriorate until his death many years later.  Much of the film is told in flashback.  Catherine took care of Robert for his last half-decade.  Did she do it out of daughterly duty?  Did she do it to be near her father's mathematical genius as she was working out her own mathematical proofs?  Did she do it to avoid moving forward with her own life and academic career?  The film suggests perhaps all three, and leaves the viewer to your own conclusions.  Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Hal, one of Robert's graduate students, smart enough to understand the high world of mathematic academics, but not quite genius enough to make the kind of revolutionary breakthroughs that make you legend.  After Robert passes away Hal asks permission to read through Robert's copious notebooks where he scribbled down page after page of gibberish, hoping that a spark of genius will appear amid the mad scribbling.  Hope Davis appears as Robert's other daughter, Claire.  Although Catherine may have inherited some of Dad's genius, Claire is the one who seems to have her life in more order - for the kind of folks who think lives should be orderly.  Claire flies into town for Robert's funeral as well, hoping to interject some order into Catherine's life.

The film does not delve into deeper mathematics.  Rudimentary arithmetic is not required to view ""Proof"".  The movie looks at the lives of these people and presents the characters ""as is"".  We see that Hal also plays drum in an alternative rock band made up of math grad students.  One of their pieces is called ""I"" after the imaginary number that equals negative one when squared - this song consists of the band standing silently on stage after telling the audience the name of the song.  If you're the kind of person who might find such things entertaining - this may be the film for you.

The storyline concentrates on Catherine and explores whether or not she may have inherited her father's genius, or his madness, or both.  Although the film is filled with the fine acting you'd expect from a collection of Academy Award winners and nominees, it was not the most pleasant thing for me to watch.",1141948800,3,3517,4.915254237288136
185513,3,1563311976,"Not since the last time John Madden directed her in ""Shakespeare in Love"" has Gwyneth Paltrow done such sterling work as she does here as Catherine Llewelyn, the daughter of a legendary mathematician and a pained woman on the verge. The vast challenge Madden faces here is cinematizing a play about intellectuals discussing the decidedly non-visual subject of mathematical proofs. He only partially succeeds in opening up the play by effectively using real-life locations at my alma mater, the University of Chicago, as well as interweaving moments that occur in the past and present with surprisingly seamlessness.

What Madden does less well is make the math interesting to the viewer, which Gus Van Sant did to better effect in ""Good Will Hunting"" and Ron Howard with more visual style in ""A Beautiful Mind"". The fabled proofs of Catherine's father Robert are discussed but not shown to any illuminating effect for the viewer, and consequently we are not engaged in the characters' extensive discussions about them. Instead, we have to relay on the credibility of the actors discussing them, a big dramatic presumption on the part of Madden. The literate plot revolves around Catherine's obsessive perception that she is descending into madness like her father before his death, and in particular, the mystery around the authorship of a breakthrough proof, i.e., whether Catherine or Robert came up with it.

Anthony Hopkins portrays Robert with his trademark bluster, but since his character consists of flashbacks in Catherine's mind, we really don't get a chance to understand his perspective on his own dementia. As Catherine's controlling sister Claire, Hope Davis proves again to be among the more chameleonic actors around as her character's narrower mindset cannot begin to fathom the creative genius of her family. It's really a thankless, two-dimensional role since Claire simply observes and provides an unwelcome myopia to the situation. Unlike his Brokeback role, Jake Gyllenhaal truly does play a supporting role here as Hal, a protege of Robert's who is so impassioned by mathematics that he pores through Robert's notebooks for days on end. While sincere and engaged, the actor hardly looks like your typical math geek and must additionally carry through the somewhat preposterous romantic situation that occurs in the middle of Catherine's mental incapacitation.

On the whole, I think this piece should have been left onstage given the reams of dialogue here. I don't feel the screenplay by David Auburn (the original playwright) and Rebecca Miller (Arthur's daughter and a better writer than a film director judging from her 2005 film ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose"") is entirely successful in translating it to maximum effect for the screen.  Nonetheless, Paltrow's galvanizing performance and the dramatic intensity of key scenes will reward the more patient among us. The DVD has relatively little in the way of extras, though it does contain a generally informative audio commentary track by Madden. There is a brief, making-of featurette that allows Madden and the actors to provide some valuable insights into the play and the characters. There are three deleted scenes, one actually an alternate to what was finally used, all understandably excised from the film.",1141862400,2,3290,5.260952380952381

I understand why Proof received such positive reviews.  It certainly walked and talked like a duck.  It boasts a cast with impeccable film credentials and contains a high brow intellectual plot that revolves around cerebral math geniuses.  Given those two points, the movie had to be Academy material, right?  Wrong.

The problem is that the movie really has nothing to say.  Hopkins, Paltrow and Gyllenahaal are all fine in their roles.  But none of them has much to do.  Hopkins is a ghost and little more than a static character in his scenes.  Paltrow is bitter, morose, a bit manic depressive and on the whole an unsympathetic character who never really changes much during the course of the film.  Gyllenhaal's role is boiler plate material as that of a twenty-something nerdy yet charismatic math whiz who worships the work of Paltrow's late father (Hopkins).  Gyllenhaal wants to review Hopkin's scribblings in the hopes of finding something important to publish for the math world.  Along the way he falls for Paltrow and she for him.  A great math proof is found and there is ambiguity as to who actually wrote it.  Not much else happens of interest in the film.  The cast plods along and is practically screaming at times for something to do in this relatively uneventful tale.  Proof isn't a bad movie, but nothing really happens in it.  I believe there is a compelling story somewhere in Proof, but when the film ends you are left wondering how it never made it to the screen.",1141689600,6,1756,4.713815789473684

I enjoy who-done-its, thrillers, and action movies but periodically venture into other categories (and thankfully so).

185532,3,1563311976,"Given the other reviews, maybe I am just stuck.  I saw this as a play at Arena Stage in DC a couple of years ago, and thought it was absolutely terrific.  Easily one of the best plays I have seen in recent years, and we seem to see a lot.  I am also a big Paltrow and Jake Gyllenhaal fan.

However, I find the film heavy-handed and Paltrow and JG distracting.  This play/screenplay has important things to say about trust, relationships, what things like mathmatics mean to the world, the meaning of genius, etc.  But the movie seems corny, trite, overplayed to me, even though the cast is wonderful.  To me it is as if the actors are doing a fantastic job of acting the wrong parts.  Perhaps the Director just sees something very different for this profoundly excellent story than I do.

185533,5,1563311976,"This isn't the type of film where you are mildly entertained and then forget about the movie within a day or two of seeing it. Instead, the directors have tackled the formidable challenge of adapting a successful Broadway show to screen and, in the process, it sometimes works in much better ways than the stage play, broadening the possibilities and losing some of the claustrophia of the limited stage sets.

 It is hard to say exactly what 'genre"" this play fits as it equal parts thriller, mystery and exploration of the human spirit.

  On the surface, the film focuses on a formerly briliant mathematical genius (played by Anthony Hopkins) who went from flashes of brilliance in his early 20s to utter insanity as he got older (with brief remissions). His daughter seems to show promise as well but she fears that the same mental instablility which plagues her father will someday strike her as well. She is a sad, often bitter, person.

  Gyneth Paltrow is so exceptional in the role of the daughter,  Catherine, a woman who is complex, difficult and anxious, that it is hard to imagine anyone else doing justice to the role. After her father's death, she is left to pick up the pieces with the help of a math student who is researching Catherine's father, in both his glory and illness.

  In addition to hundreds of illegible journals left behind by her father, one stands out, possibly leading to a breakthrough moment in mathmatical history. It is, in short a great proof...but who wrote it? Did the genius father in one of his rare moments of remission? Or did his talented (but unacclaimed) daughter do so?

  Needless to say, this raises issues of trust as well as how you prove something which is very hard to prove. Catherine has been a recluse for years, caring for her ailing father. She disappeared from academia and her reputation was never established. Contrast that with the history of her father and it his hard to decide who was most likely to be in a state of mind to come up with an elegant, groundbreaking proof.

  As doubt rears its head, Catherine seems to be suspected by everyone around her, from her boyfriend to her sister. She nearly cracks completely under the pain and pressure and the film doesn't lead to a neat, pat resolution.

  The word ""Proof"" revolves on so many levels in this lovely movie, hinting that some things are ultimately unproveable and must be taken on a certain degree of faith. Catherine nearly loses her strength, her spirit and her confidence in the process but she is stronger than she thinks, although her sister does her best to sabotage her confidence and whatever shreds of self-esteem she has left.

  This is a deep, rich movie that makes one think about how we commit to people and ideas, how we prove that our accomplishments are our own (when all evidence seems to point to the contrary) and but how it is always a  the leap of faith to trust others. In that regard, these is no ultimate proof.",1140739200,6,2965,4.655769230769231

However, on both accounts, this is not so. I felt this movie amounted to nothing much more then a pile of cliches. I'm suprised Ebert and all the other reviews claim it was well acted -If anything, I think Paltrow in particular overacted her part (in terms of portraying a neurotic/scizo) and wasn't convincing enough as a mathematician.

Speaking of which, no one in the film was convincing as a mathematician partly because no actaul matheamtics seems to make it to this movie. Sure they throw out words like ""Algebraic Geometry,"" or ""Game Theory"" (More an Economics field then Matheamtics anyways) but that is the extent of the ""mathematics"" in this film.

It seems the author could have easily made the film a little more authentic by hiring an actaul facaulty of matheamtics as an advisor to the film. What is funny about what little that is shown is its mostly Analysis (if its anything recognizable at all, a vast majority of the things writ on the board are as far as my friends and I can tell, giberish), whereas suppodly this great awe-inspiring proof (A proof whose structure is actaully never remotely discusssed) that Paltrow's character may have written (and also what her father suppodly worked in) was  Algebra/Number Theory.

A simple analogy to demonstrate my gripe about this film is it's like if one were to have made a movie about individuals in some other less abstract field, perhaps an engineer or inventor, and the film contained virtually nothing about the subject this[these] indiivdual[s] were known for. It would make the film seem a bit empty (and would defeat the purpose of basing a movie on these people).

Of course I admit this movie's main drive is evidently not mathematics (and it's target audience is certanily not mathematicians), its really a romance story. Yet, even given this I must say it was far less enjoyable then past titles with similiar premise (the so-called ""romance w. nerds"" sub-genre). I can think of two movies that did this type of film far better, that is IQ (Walter Mathau, 1994) and Beautiful Mind (Crow, 2001).

In the later, although there was virtually no mathematics as well, they at least ""talked"" about the subject that John Nash discovered in some brief detail. Also, of course, the acting was more convincing in that case as well.

Even other movies based on ficticious genius like ""Good Will Hunting"" had more convincing main characters (and much more compelling character drama) then Paltrow's mathematician and her toils with the outside world. I think with Paltrow's character, one see's only one facet of her personality (that is the incomprehsensible neurotic side), whereas a film like ""Good Will Hunting"" we saw the characters behave like actaul people every once in a while (and in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""IQ"" the characters' personalities actaully changed and grew throughout the span of the film).

The result is of course, as I stated above, a cliche (not that most films nowadays arn't devoid of this, but in this case, I believe its it much more evident). In any event,this film was one of the few movies I have purchased and felt it was a waste. In comparative terms, from its set of peers, it probably fits closest to a little known film ""Infinity"" about Richard Feynman.

In fact, that film also mentiond virtually nothing about Feynman's work and stayed almost entirely within the romance story. I'd say ""Proof"" is much more enjoyable then that film, however its far less enjoyable then ""Good Will Hunting"" and certanily does not compare with ""IQ,"" ""Beautiful Mind,"" or ""October Sky"" (that is other similiar films). The movie is a rent, as opposed to a buy, in my opinion.",1140307200,11,3897,4.8466165413533835
185547,1,1563311976,"I think I have learned more mathematics by watching the movie Proof than I have learned in the past four years of an undergraduate mathematics major.  For instance, I was unaware that proofs were things that demonstrated theorems. After watching the movie the first time through, I felt compelled to do a frame by frame analysis of all mathematical results published in this movie.  I cannot deign to be able to vouch for the validity of all results, for they are too far advanced.  However, if they prove what I think they prove, then it's a very important proof!

I won't waste anymore of your time by expounding on the virtues of this movie-- they are clear.  It is a movie that reinforces the reality of mathematics:  that it is dominated by people of questionable mental stability.  Even the most stable mathematicians in this movie are a bit, shall we say, eccentric.  Go watch this accurate portrayal of reality and see the profundity of its mathematical results, if you can.",1140307200,7,982,4.735294117647059
185548,4,1563311976,"According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, there are several definitions of the word ""proof"" that apply to the movie of the same name adapted from the David Auburn play.  The etymology of the word can be traced back to the Latin ""probare,"" meaning, ""to prove.""  Both parts of the first definition of ""proof"" as a noun come into play: ""(a) the cogency of evidence that compels acceptance by the mind of a truth or a fact; (b) the process or an instance of establishing the validity of a statement especially by derivation from other statements in accordance with principles of reasoning.""  But there is also another meaning of proofs that is relevant to the story, which in the field of mathematics, where a proof is a demonstration that, assuming certain axioms, some statement is necessarily true.

Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the daughter of a Robert (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant mathematician who has recently died.  Robert made two enormous contributions to the field when he was in his early 20s and then got ""sick,"" a euphemism by which his family and friends referred to his schizophrenia when they were not coming right out and saying the man went mad.  Catherine followed in her father's footsteps, studying mathematics, albeit at a different university, and she is worried that maybe she is like him in having mental problems as well.  After all, her father is dead and she is still having conversations with him.  But she has more immediate concerns because now that Robert is dead, the vultures are circling down.

There is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), who was Robert's student and has taken it upon himself to go throw the dozens of notebooks in which he scribbled mathematical formulas and insane ramblings.  Catherine suspects Hal is looking for something that he can steal as his own to make his own reputation, and hitting on her does not make her think much more of him.  Claire (Hope Davis), her sister comes in from out of town, sells their father's house from under Catherine, whom she seems convinced, is having mental problems.  Then Catherine gives Hal a notebook, and in the notebook there is a proof (of the mathematical sort).

The proof appears to be brilliant, but that, of course, has to be proven.  But then Catherine claims that she and not Robert is the author of the proof.  Both Hal and Claire find this hard to believe, and on some level Catherine has doubts as well.  Is she a brilliant mathematician like her father, trying to attain a validation now that she never received before, or is she simply schizophrenic?  More importantly, what would constitute sufficient proof to prove any or all of the above?

I have not had a math class since I was a freshman in high school when I took geometry, so I have no clue what the math geeks in this movie are talking about, but that is okay because it is the idea of the proof and not the proof itself that matters in ""Proof.""  But when I stopped taking math courses I started participating in debate, so I know something about the fine art (if not science) of argument and how to prove things.  The irony here is that neither Hal nor Claire, nor Catherine for that matter, seek any proof.  They all make assumptions and the only relevant evidence has to do with penmanship.  This leads to the question of what sort of proof we would be willing to accept, but director John Madden is not leaving that to chance.

""Proof"" will appeal to those who are interested in the fine line between genius and madness, even if that idea is becoming overly related to the field of mathematics in movies of late.  Paltrow's character is at the heart of the story and virtually every scene is between her and the other characters.  Hopkin's character goes from lucidity to ravings, but what matters is how Paltrow reacts to him, because they constitute the key proof as to her emotional state and mathematical abilities.  Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes with whichever way the wind is blowing, but it is Davis who's compassion and concern for her Catherine is chilling, so there was a strong sense in how I wanted Claire to be wrong more than I wanted Catharine to be right.",1140134400,,4141,4.70873786407767
185549,5,1563311976,"""Proof"" is based on the play by David Auburn, who contributed screenwriting skills as well. The film was directed by John Madden, who previously directed Gwyneth Paltrow in a successful run of the play in London. So both Madden and Paltrow come to the film with a lot of experience. They are joined by a superb film cast, most notably Hope Davis, in bringing this intriguing story of family and identity that revolves around an important mathematical proof to the screen. Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the daughter of a brilliant mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) who struggled with mental illness. Catherine is very much like her father, so much that it scares her, and was very close to him. She gave up 5 years of her life to take care of him when he was overcome by psychosis. Now her father is dead, and Catherine's fastidious, controlling sister Claire (Hope Davis), has arrived to put everything in order and take control of Catherine's life, which she fears is heading off the deep end. A former student of their father's, Harold (Jake Gyllenhaal), is determined to look at every piece of gibberish the great man wrote in his last years in case any important math found its way through his madness. Catherine relents and leads Harold to the prize: a fantastic proof. But who wrote it?

I have only occasionally seen any indication that Gwyneth Paltrow is anything more than a mediocre actress, but those little glimmers of talent were signs of better things to come. Paltrow is very good in this role. Catherine is an intelligent, fragile woman whose outbursts may or may not indicate instability, but who has consciously chosen to deny her nature, even to herself. From the outside, she is an unnerving enigma. From the inside, she suffered tremendously for her father's madness. Director John Madden presents this story as dual narratives: The subjective past, which we see through Catherine's memories, is alternated with the objective present. This is very effective. Clues to the film's 2 mysteries, Catherine's character and the proof's authorship, are found in the past, which unfolds simultaneously with the present narrative that focuses on Catherine's changing relationships with Claire and Harold. I applaud Madden's decision to use a steadicam to impart a sense of realism and immediacy. It works nicely, and it's a whole lot better than a shaky handheld. ""Proof"" is a thoroughly enjoyable film whose characters always have something interesting going on in their minds. Its talkiness betrays its theatrical roots, but Madden has done such a good job of placing the action in natural settings that I was rarely aware of the film's theatricality.

The DVD (Buena Vista/Miramax 2006): Bonus features are a making-of documentary, 2 deleted and 1 extended scene with optional director's commentary (7 min), and an audio commentary. ""From Stage to Screen: The Making of Proof"" (10 min) includes interviews with director John Madden, producers, and cast who discuss the characters and adapting the play to film. There is a good audio commentary in which John Madden contributes a lot of analysis of the narrative structure and characters, taking us through Catherine's thoughts and emotions, as well as discussing themes, visual style, dialogue, and directorial decisions. Captions are available for the film in English. Subtitles and dubbing are available in French.",1140134400,2,3380,5.121376811594203
185550,4,1563311976,"Proof of a mathematical equation and proof of madness are the two driving forces in John Madden's film. Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) who cared for her brilliant mathematician father Robert (Anthony Hopkins) is afraid that she's inherited his other ""gift""-mental illness. Catherine cared for her father Robert during the end. When Claire (Hope Davis) Catherine's sister arrives home for the funeral she expresses concern for Catherine's mental state. Catherine begins to doubt her own teetering sanity. Robert's assistant Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) rummages around Robert's papers the night before and after the funeral trying to find an important equation her father was working on before he died. Featuring a group of strong performances, ""Proof"" is a compelling drama about grief, madness and emotional seclusion. Although Madden's drama suffers from the stage origins of the play but the emotional high wire act the cast performs makes it worthwhile. Whether or not there's ""proof"" of this film being a ""great"" film is based on how drawn into the drama you are by the appealing cast. A warning about some of the other reviews here--there good reviews but some of them have spoilers that give away a lot of the plot of the film. If you want to be surpised and enjoy the ride then I'd suggest you skip reading these reviews.

 ""Proof"" looks extremely good here with natural skin tones, sharp image quality and nice definition. The 5.1 audio isn't exactly designed for the format since this a dialogue driven film but there is nice ambient sounds evident in the other speakers.

A clinical but interesting commentary track by John Madden is interesting to listen to but would have been enlightened by the cast's contribution. We also get deleted scenes none of which are revelations ""From Stage to Screen"" covers the adaptation of the stage play to film. One of the challenges was staying true to the stage roots while opening up the player and making it less stage bound. Producer Allison Owen makes an interesting comment-she imagined the film as the type of film that would have been made in the 70's where moving and powerful drama was still king in theaters. The cast and Madden discuss their characters and what attracted them to the project. Madden comments that many audience members thought that the play was like watching a movie which is a bit unusual but that was because of the fact that the play was told from a variety of different points of view and the staging.

 A fine film that touches on madness, emotional isolation and the fear of what lies down the road for anyone; ""Proof"" is a fascinating drama that works amazingly well due to the strong performances. Madden who worked with Paltrow in ""Shakespeare in Love"" clearly connects with Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins.",1140048000,40,2779,4.954935622317596
185551,5,1563311976,"PROOF is one of those rare films that transfers a superb play directly to the screen without losing a bit of the power of the play, but enhancing the story with the advantages of the camera.  With a tough story like this one it takes a brilliant cast and director to fine-tune the work and in this instance it all works to perfection.

The story is well known from all the PR of the theatrical screening: recounting it in a review does not  add or subtract the importance of the film or the experience of the viewer.  The premise, mathematician Robert (Anthony Hopkins) and his caretaker daughter Catherine (Gweneth Paltrow) who also is an uncommonly bright  27-year-old mathematics mind and has spent the glowing years of her youth caring for her recently deceased father. They converse in flashbacks, a means of realizing the closeness of their bond emotionally, mentally, and probably parallel mental illness proclivities.  Robert left notebooks filled with thoughts and clues to a complex mathematical proof and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a devoted admirer of Robert's genius, is organizing the thoughts and deciphering the meanings of Robert's scribblings. Catherine's estranged sister Claire (Hope Davis) arrives to 'settle' the matters left by Robert's demise and becomes the camera that brings focus to the fact that Catherine has inherited not only her father's genius but his mental fragility as well.  How this quartet - Robert, Catherine, Hal, Claire - serve to unravel the findings of Robert's (and Catherine's) legacy is the essence of this gripping tale.

A more powerful group of actors for this film would be difficult to find.  One expects the brilliance of Paltrow's performance since she had time with the character on the stage, and Hopkins can toss these bizarre characters off with grace and aplomb.  But it is the pleasure of seeing Davis and Gyllenhaal rise to the same level of expertise that makes the film glow.  This is an example of ensemble acting of the highest form and director Madden conducts the performance with sensitivity and momentum.  The result is a treasureable, intelligent, powerful film that challenges the mind while entertaining all the senses.  Highly recommended.

Gwenneth has to figure out how to act like a genius that is humble, absolutely gorgeous but not worthy of any praise, kinda like downplaying how stunning beautiful you are on screen and be coquetish, clueless and alarmingly charming.

No sirree, all you have to do is suspend your belief that true brilliance is an aberration fraught with instability, self adulation and insanity and you're halfway home.
