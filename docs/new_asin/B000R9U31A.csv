What appealed to me and maybe not everyone, is she didn't lock you down into a ridged format. Meaning there isn't only one way to play this and that.  I was familiar with most of what she presented, but it was good to have it reinforced from a pro.  I was very appreciative of her effort putting out the DVDs.  My POV it is a great addition since there isn't much out there for this style of play.",1420329600,,555,4.216981132075472
8199686,3,B000R9U31A,"If you're looking for the McDonald's approach to Delta Blues, and the E-Z way to play bottleneck riffs without actually fingering any chords, this course is for you. Mrs. Block does essentially the same 3 or 4 things over and over again and applies it to several of Robert Johnson's songs. In between, we are treated to her musical philosophy - which apparently includes her pride in not being able to read music or understand basic musical terminology - and the deep reverence of a former East Village strummer for someone who could actually play.
If this is all a little too wishy-washy, streamlined, pasteurized and homogenized for you - and you actually know the names of the notes you're playing 'n' stuff - I very much recommend you buy Scott Ainslie's Robert Johnson Signature Licks DVD instead. You'll learn more from Mr. Ainslie in 5 minutes than from Mrs. Block in 4 hours.",1418083200,,883,4.740259740259741
8199687,4,B000R9U31A,"I have never even heard of anyone who has so thoroughly investigated the mechanics of Robert Johnson's playing style.  If you want to know the likely way Johnson played his tunes, this CD will walk you through it.  This not a CD for beginners.  You should have at least a medium proficiency for guitar if you are going to tackle this method.

Rory does a lot of remarkable story telling and name dropping intermingled with her instruction.  She obviously reveres Robert Johnson and romanticizes his style as equivalent to classical orchestral music.  That's a bit over the top.  I did find it ironic however, with her emphasis on authentic reproduction of Johnson's sound, that she chooses a $6,000+ Martin to play it with.  Why not play a restored Stella or a Washburn parlor guitar?  She's a virtuoso blues player in the old style and very interesting to watch and listen to, but I think the Martin detracts from her presentation when it comes to playing Robert Johnson authentically.",1409097600,,986,4.821428571428571

8199689,5,B000R9U31A,"I have been playing guitar and the blues since 1969, and at the age of fourteen,  I found and listened to RJ and learned, as best I could from ear many of his tunes, from the original vinyl release.  And, like so many, i have been intrigued with his history.

Ms. Block is a master.  She has a depth of understanding of RJ, his music, and intricate details of his style that are simply, unequaled.

Now for the relevant part.  She's a great teacher, and breaks down intricate sections of the songs to make them possible.  They are, at times, technically challenging to play correctly, but, it is all there, in her video as well as the download booklet on the DVD.  (I have no idea what another reviewer is referring to about poor Xerox quality, as you print these out from a file on the DVD using your home computer and printer.  Perhaps at one time this wasn't the case.  My materials printed perfectly and in a full size 8x11 format. )

Ms. Block moves at the right pace, is extremely interesting not only in demonstrations, but also, in really digging into some subtleties that will help you be a better musician, no matter your level.  Also, she has great stories about RJ, and best, performance tips that are great.  Best guitar video I've used.  And its easy to stay enthralled and to follow along.  That isn't often the case with instructional videos, in my experience.

I highly recommend these videos to improve your ear, your funk, your timing, and breadth of finger style techniques.  Ive been playing country blues for ....over 40 years, and I learned a lot.  Having long ago worked out many tunes in standard tuning, and being no stranger to open tuning and slide, this series offers a fast track if you are just starting RJ or slide work.  Ms. Block not only a great guitarist and vocalist, but a great teacher.

Get this set while you can, This is a sleeper.",1392422400,2,1873,4.501483679525222
