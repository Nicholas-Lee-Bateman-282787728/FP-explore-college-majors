It is 50 minutes long and thats about 45 minutes too long. The only good part is the last five minutes. The whole film is shot in black and white and or grainy,blurry pixelated film. It is torture to watch and gave me a headache. A plot is not really necessary for a good horror movie but this had no plot and no purpose. At no time do you really know whats going on and why. Skip this film.",1516492800,,531,4.018867924528302

8673904,1,B00MQ6NHRO,"This movie sucks! It's one of those you could film with an IPhone, and use your untalented friends as the cast. Then ketchup for special effects. Don't buy this, save your money!!!",1423958400,3,180,4.65625
8673905,3,B00MQ6NHRO,"This is not what I would call a horror film. It's more of an indie necro/torture exploitation movie. In a nutshell: IF you are into a buxom woman getting it on with a corpse while torturing a kidnapped man, well then you are in luck. A girl in a slipknot mask tortures a poor guy for 40 min, the rest of the film is an attempt to capture the less violent side of her unstable nature through ""interviews"" and blurred cinematography. So not my kind of horror, I wasn't thrilled. Coupled with the fact that you can't buy this one for less than near $20 shipped and it's only a 3 star experience at very best.",1422403200,3,605,4.224137931034483
8673906,4,B00MQ6NHRO,"I picked this one up cheap, this is a low budget movie and I really enjoyed it. Some parts of the film you could tell that it was low budget but if you really watch the movie it flows well and seems like there is potential for a series of films with this one. Graphic at times and some nekro involved. The really only issue with this film was a loud noise during one part of the film that lasted a bit to long. I have seen three films from this director and he has turned me into a fan of his work. There are a lot of indie horror directors out there and I can see that Mr. Mills is a threat to all of them.",1421884800,2,607,3.7874015748031495
