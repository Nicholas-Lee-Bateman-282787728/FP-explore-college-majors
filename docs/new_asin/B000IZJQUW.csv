Now the movie itself:

The plot is disappointing, w/ a ridiculous script, even crazier dialogues. The cinematography, customs, editing, direction, the female lead all follow the same sinking ship.  The acting was so robotic.  Watched it mainly for debut role of the male lead. The music is pleasant and a few memorable tracks.  If you grew up in the 90s, then the music, Bobby Deols long locks and his round shades from the movie, have been tattooed in your head.",1460592000,,659,4.646551724137931
