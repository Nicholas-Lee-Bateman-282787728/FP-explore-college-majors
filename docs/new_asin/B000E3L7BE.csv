2485850,5,B000E3L7BE,"I dabble in Anime once in a while when it really interests me.  I've been into Anime since Robotech in the 80's but I'm not hardcore.  I really just find a series I like and watch it but I'm not proactive with searching out Anime.  I'm so glad I found out about Eureka Seven.  Although this is just a review of the DVD set, I have seen the series up to episode 43 and must say that this Anime is one of the best series I've seen in quite a while.

At first the whole concept of air surfing mechs looked pretty cheesy (mostly cuz i'm still in love with the mechs from Macross) but it didn't take long to win me over. The aerial battle scenes are awesome.  I like how they incorporate x-games type moves during battles scenes like the cut back drop turn (surfing) to evade missiles.

This series kinda reminds me of Lost a little bit.  You start right in the thick of the story and throughout the series, you get a little backstory of the main characters.

The overall main story is terrific and imaginative.  Basically, you're the events in the series take place in another planet where ancestors of ""earthlings"" have settled.  Renton is the son of Adirock Thurston who was a military scientist who saved the world during the Summer of Love.  He meets Eureka one day and decides to go with her and the members of GekkoState and from there he slowly (and sometimes painfully) finds out his role is bigger than he could ever imagine.  I'll leave it at that.  Along with the action is a sweet love story between Renton and Eureka and lots of comedy c/o the other members of GekkoState.  Just a side note, if you watch carefully you'll notice little tidbits of pop culture.  Two of the GekkoState members are Woz and Jobs (Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs) who are the tech guys and another two are Gidget and Moondoggie (from the Gidget movies).  Also they mention that Holland is from North Shore (north shore hawaii is the mecca of surfing); when Renton goes to his uncle's plantation (that looks like cuba) he sees a billboard of his father that resembles the famous Che Guevarra picture; and a lot more.  I dunno I just think little things like that is cool.

Pick up this series you won't be disappointed. I love it!",1149811200,2,2213,4.419753086419753
2485851,5,B000E3L7BE,"I've had mixed feelings about Studio Bones in the past. Cowboy Bebop had the style, the characters, the music, the atmosphere, and way too much violence. Rahxephon was a trip worth taking, but a trip none the less. Wolf's Rain was a garbled mess despite fantastic art, music, and story (I attribute that to just plain bad direction). Now THIS...this is something TOTALLY different.

Anyone remember the funky music and atmosphere of Jet Set Radio (not to mention that crazy-cool art sytle)? What about the sweet character designs of FLCL (and it's slick soundtrack)? Okay, now remember the feeling you'd get when you saw something just plain awesome in one of those Mecha sagas like Macross? Stir it all up in the anime blender and you get something...like THIS.

Just trying to describe the universe of this series is very hard to do. It's a sci-fi world unlike any other. Most people go about their lives on a planet where energy currents flow underground and through the skies (leaving glowing colors in their wake). People ride these currents on futuristic surfboards and (you guessed it) Giant Robots. (: Of course, the robot designs are by Shoji Kawamori, so of COURSE they transform :)

The plot is hard to describe because it's kind of hidden from the start. We get the generic pathetic kid wants to escape his boring reality and finds himself thrown into high adventure with a mysterious young woman leading the way, but naturally that's just an excuse to get things started. The real story involves aliens, the past, the main character Renton's lost family, and the secret of who exactly that strange girl Eureka is. Naturally we won't get into any of that for a while though.

What we will get into this volume is GekkoState, the terrorist/skysurfer organization with unknown motives, the stylish yet strangely stoic, yet compellingly sweet Eureka, and the poor teenager Renton who is obsessed with becoming a sky-surfing legend like the GekkoState crowd he worships, and the oh-so-mysterious disappearance of Renton's sister and father (who supposedly saved the entire planet once upon a time).

The story unfolds rather slowly, revealing very little about the true nature of most of the characters, or their true motives. There's plenty to keep you busy in the mean-time however. The music totally rocks and augments the action beautifully (I have the soundtrack on pre-order). The animation and artwork is breath-taking, truly pushing your TV and DVD player to their limits. The animation is just so bright, so detailed, and so GORGEOUS that the first episode took my breath away in spots. For a 50 episode TV show, the high budget and superlative quality really shines.

While not perhaps having the high amount of action as Gundam or Macross (yet?), the action sequences are well executed and fast paced. We've got Macross-style missiles being evaded, surf-board rides through the stratosphere, and super-weapons spewing light like the end of the world (and it's still only the first 5 episodes).

The voice acting in both dubs is quite good, although the English dub perhaps lacks some of the clarity of the Japanese, and some of the subtitle translations are questionable. I would probably listen to the English, except I just prefer the voice actress' voice who plays Renton for some reason. If you dig the Japanese track you may also want to check out the commentary with the two voice actresses who play the two main characters, and the interviews included.

This show creates a totally new world to be explored, and it wouldn't surprise me if it builds up a considerable following later on as people discover it. So far it's been worth seeing for the music and visuals alone. Oh, and if you don't think Jet Set Radio has anything to do with the sense of style in this show, just compare Gum's costume to Eureka's. Riiiiiiiiight.",1149033600,18,3850,4.912307692307692
2485852,5,B000E3L7BE,"(Because of a mistake made by Amazon.com, this review was also posted for the regular edition of the first volume of Eureka Seven. Please disregard the review of the box set, as that was what I was originally reviewing.)

I don't know what got into me when I purchased this set from Amazon.com. I'm usually never lolled in by Special Edition sets unless it has a box to contain all the discs in the series. Beyond that, I'm not too interested; all I care about is the anime. But I bought this box set on a hunch (though I was looking at the collector's box at the time, to be sure). Something told me that Eureka Seven wasn't to be underestimated as the next big series. And after I watched the first disc, I'm completely sure I was right. If marketed correctly, Eureka Seven should take the place of Fullmetal Alchemist when they finally complete their DVD release run.

In truth, I'm not really here to talk about the series, but this box set in particular. As the title says, this box is filled to the brim and running over. Not only does it have the first disc and a collector's case, but it has the soundtrack, which as of the time of this writing has yet to be released, the first volume of the manga series, and for all of you fan-boys and -girls, a t-shirt as well. And I will say that nothing here left me disappointed (except for maybe the shirt, as I'll probably never wear it, but either way it was free). The shear value of this set is what makes it great. Consider this: most special edition sets with collector's boxes market for about $30; the Eureka Seven soundtrack will go for $20; the manga will sell for $10; and the shirt will probably go for somewhere around $15. Added all up, that equals a value of around $75. Yet you get all of this for only $45.

So, if you're planning on collecting this series then I wouldn't miss out on this set. Everything here is a great companion to the excellent anime included, and the slip-case collector's box is unique enough to add a little flair to the DVD shelf. Get this and enjoy everything it has to offer. There is hours of entertainment in this box.

Now for the anime...

Eureka Seven is a beautiful anime, and has everything that to me makes an anime great:

1) Animation--Eureka Seven has some the cleanest and freshest animation I've seen, and seems to somewhat resemble an FLCL mixed with Fullmetal Alchemist. Not only that, but the action is smooth and exciting, the character designs are unique, and the settings really add to the story that is taking place.

2) Story--firstly, Eureka Seven has some great characters, with Renton, a bored boy who just wants a little change, to Eureka, a wise-for-her-age girl who pilots a giant wind-surfing robot. And while this series contains a large cast, it does well to keep a few of the cliches out (though not all, I will admit). As for the story surrounding these characters, that's pretty good as well, at least from what I saw so far. Renton, as stated, wants a little change, and feels locked in the boring city in which he grew up in. That's when Eureka makes an appearance--of sorts--and Renton not only falls in love with her but makes his decision to finally change his life. Also, he must do this while living with the knowledge that his sister has disappeared, and his father is the man who saved the world.

3) Music--if you've read any of my past anime reviews, then you know I highly regard Cowboy Bebop, FLCL, Samurai Champloo, and Wolf's Rain not only for their great stories but for their excellent music as well. Eureka Seven follows in the same route, adding a techo-dance theme to their musical score that accompanies the goings on in the series oh so well. Luckily, the soundtrack comes paced inside, so you can hear this music anytime you like.

No matter which version you do buy, though, I wouldn't miss this anime either way. Eureka Seven seems to me to have everything people should love in an anime. And the future for this long anime series is very promising.",1146096000,17,4001,4.5
2485853,4,B000E3L7BE,"Eureka Seven is one of those series that appears to wanna emulate some aspect of pop culture.  The choice here is apparently surfing, but in this anime it's obvious of a different kind.  The series character names are taken or derived from the world of surfing, rock, and others taking in the era's from the fifties to today.  Some are surfing related like Gidget and Moondoggie, and some indicate more the professions, like Jobs , and Woz (Steve Jobs, and Steve Wozniac founded Apple Computer), who play engineers.

The plot is a bit far fetched, but interesting none the less.  Man has colonized a planet at some point in the past, and there are environmental issues.  The steps he has taken to correct those may be making the situation worse.  There are other things at work here, but I don't want to spoil the series for you.  This however is not for the impatient.  While enjoyable, there are slow episodes and the plot develops quite slowly as well.  If you are good at putting together hints you may arrive at some conclusions earlier. Not much of the back story is revealed in any particular episode, until you get to episode 29 when a major piece is filled in.

That's probably a good thing because it takes that long for the two focal characters to come to terms with who they are. Initially, I too felt impatient about the wait for this much of the plot to develop. I changed my mind about that after thinking about it some.  There are a lot of anime series out there about boy mecha pilots (what is it the Japanese have with 14 year olds piloting these things).  Most don't give the leads much justification, beyond simple protection, and sometimes revenge to take the controls. In the Evangelion series for instance, would you really want someone as naive, and messed up as the disturbed boy Shinji to decide the fate of the world? In this series, the boy pilot was put through a lot before the facts were revealed to him. It effected him greatly, but he came to terms, he didn't go nuts or all indecisive as in some series.  You can understand him, and how he makes his choices later in the series.  That can be said too for his main and initial reason for starting this adventure, the girl Eureka.

Now, I don't want to scare off a lot of parents here, but the group the boy joins, the Gekkostate, which sounds like a small country is more like a terrorist cell.  Other than their deadly contacts with the military however they don't prey on civilians.  A good part of the series illustrates a lot of the darker side of man.  Governmental mis-information leads to racial and religious hatred and oppression.  Mans exploitation of the environment has way overstepped the bounds of being judicious.  In a particularly stupid, greedy, selfish, and perhaps evil manor the powers that be, plan genocide as a viable solution.

Now as for this box set, a real bargain if you like extras, it comes with a high quality brown (not the usual white or black) T-Shirt, although the transfer I got was poorly done, two Music CDs with nearly 50 songs, A full copy of the first graphic novel produced for the series, A DVD with the first 5 episodes, and a high quality art box to hold the first couple seasons. You will rarely find this much in one special edition set, at least not for the kind of pricing seen here.  I believe that since this is a relatively new series from Japan, and has not had a long time in fan-subs, or other promotion, the idea is to give you some initial value, and a taste of the series.  For those who want to wait, this is playing on Adult Swim on the Cartoon Network.  On TV there are likely to be cuts, either for time, or for some degree of violence. All that said, if you like your action Gundam Wing style, go elsewhere. If you enjoy a storyline that won't play out in the first episode give this a try. I had to take away a star for being a little far fetched as far as even SciFi goes.  If you have good suspension of disbelief skills, go ahead and add one back.",1145664000,30,3998,4.4275956284153
2485854,5,B000E3L7BE,"Eureka Seven is my favorite show ever, and I wanted to start supporting it and getting the dvd's.

2485855,5,B000E3L7BE,"it starts a little bid clumsy, but after you get the first idea, well, its pure fun.

2485856,5,B000E3L7BE,"As the title says, Eureka 7 is one of my favorite animes ever. It has a nice, crisp animation, absolutely awesome soundtracks, interesting story, comedy and romance elements mixed in, and, of course, the mecha. Let me spell this for you: GIANT. ROBOTS. ON. SURFBOARDS!

Most of the characters in Eureka 7 are very interesting, rich and complex. Eureka - the female lead - is especially cool: mysterious, enigmatic, and silent. The male lead, on the other hand, annoys a lot of the watchers because of being, quote, ""a whiny kid"". I don't think that's the case though - Renton is just being a normal 14 year old kid who suddenly has to deal with a lot of new responsibilities and hardships in his life. This is a story about him growing up, among other things.

Speaking of the story, it starts off pretty slowly, introducing new characters and explaining their situation in detail. There's no shortage of action scenes, but the storyline really begins to unfold only in the second part of the anime (it has 50 episodes in total).",1221868800,,1029,4.679558011049724
2485857,2,B000E3L7BE,"While Eureka Seven contains many positive aspects, including fresh, high-quality animation and music as well as somewhat unique characters and premise, this is one for the rental queue unless you are a hardcore collector of anime in general and must have every title on the shelf.  Though not nearly as bad a train-wreck as Planetes, which engendered similarly high expectations with its early episodes and follows closely the same themes, Eureka Seven will leave most seasoned anime fans reaching for the Amazon Sell button by the time it's over.  That is, if they make it to the end.

The first episode is almost stunning in its artwork and its instantly  engaging and rapidly developing action and story.  This mood continues, though gradually losing steam, throughout season one, as unique characters, backstory and situations are revealed and developed.  However, the first warning sign is male lead Renton Thurston, who is pretty much a stock anime character archetype:  the clueless, whiny introverted young Japanese male.  He of course develops somewhat of a spine late in the series, although in a nauseating and purely politically correct ""clean hands"" and stock fashion.

The distinct disappointment of Eureka Seven is the tremendous potential of the early episodes being wasted, as it devolves into a somewhat disjointed, meandering, tear-soaked morality play with dialogue lifted straight from any common social psych text found in any American university, mixed with entire episodes of daytime soap opera just to make sure we get the point.  If you haven't already threatened to throw the fancy collector's box through the TV screen by the last quarter of the series, you will in the final episodes.  Although, if you think the Ludovico Technique that Alex from Clockwork Orange endured for receiving information is valid, you may enjoy the final episodes of Eureka Seven.

Not only do you get to hear a side character explain the plot, the theme and the moral to you for 5 minutes while standing virtually still; you get to hear Renton Thurston then regurgitate the entire spiel to not just one, but two more characters, separately.  Apparently, modern audiences aren't sufficiently intelligent to simply understand these pedantic moral lessons from entertaining action and context; their minds have to be imprinted via multiple enforced pressings with no movement or story in the way.

Since many will not agree with my assessment of this series and can enjoy it for the various reasons detailed in other reviews, I won't myself keep making my point again and again, and again, and again...

Suffice to say, that if you are a seasoned anime fan expecting something in the same class with Fullmetal Alchemist or Neon Genesis Evangelion (or any of another hundred or so anime series), then definitely rent this series before buying it.  Many, if not most, of you will be disappointed as well and reaching for that Sell button.",1221091200,3,2940,5.106471816283925
2485858,5,B000E3L7BE,This one has a lot of charm.  I love the artistic style and the amount of detail in the characters they designed into this series.  Not knowing much of the story I picked it up and am very happy with starting what seems like a great series.  I love the use of color and the ending credits song is amazing.  Best song in an Anime for me since the opening credits to Escaflowne.  Cool mechs and action too.,1211760000,,404,4.128205128205129
2485859,5,B000E3L7BE,"A great start to what promises to be a great anime. Thus far it is pretty light hearted. We get a fairly light hearted introduction to the characters and the basic story elements.

It has a great mix of comedy and action and definitely a hint of a greater story lingering beneath the surface. One of the best components of the series so far is the varied cast. It's a large cast, but doesn't suffer from many overdone character types or redundant personalities. Each character even has a unique look and you don't get much of the sibling effect in this show.

Another great element is the look of the rest of the show. It mixes a sci-fi/futuristic look with a retro 60s and 70s style. I'm usually not one for retro styles but it works quite well in this case. The animation itself is also well above average for an anime series and remains consistent with the quality set by the art itself. The soundtrack is quite diverse as well, but also seems to use a retro style at times, while other times it adopts a techno or even alternative style. The voice acting is great as well, both sub and dub. I prefer the dub myself, but sub fans certainly won't be disappointed either.

It is a mecha series at heart, but there's a lot to it at that. At this point there's not a whole lot of story, but what we've had so far has been great to watch and has done a wonderful job introducing the characters and themes.

The special edition comes with a free copy of the 1st manga, a 2-disc soundtrack release, an artbox and a brown size large t-shirt with the Gekkostate logo on the front and the Eureka Seven logo written vertically down the back. I felt the manga failed to live up to the style of the series, but the soundtrack is pretty diverse and impressive and the shirt is actually of pretty good quality.

The artbox opens and closes by removing the entire top piece, which is the bulk of the box. It's an interesting design, but the cardboard piece on the bottom portion that the top portion closes around when you put it back on is already showing wear on my artbox. It's still a great box though, and the artwork is a great example of the shows style. The image of Renton on the box seems a bit young compared to his age in the series, but that's only minor nitpicking.",1203120000,,2266,4.334905660377358

2485865,5,B000E3L7BE,"Eureka Seven is an anime that has surprised me.  I am not the type that likes anime involving giant robots....usually.  For example, I don't really like any of the Gundam animes, but Eureka Seven is an exception. The show involves LFOs which are basically giant robots people can ride things called Waves in.  They can also use boards to ride these Waves, it is very much like surfing only without water.

The story's main character is a 14 year old boy named Renton Thurston, and more than anything else in the whole world, he would like to leave his boring home town and his boring life behind.  Oppurtunity knocks when the Nirvash type Zero(that's another big robot) crashes where he lives and out from it comes Eureka, the girl of his dreams.

Eureka is in fact a member of GekkoState, a group of rogues that ride the waves.  More importantly, Renton idolizes them.  He soon comes face to face with Holland, the leader of GekkoState and his idol.  Renton's dreams come true when he becomes a member of Gekkostate, leaving behind his old life... at least for now. However, Renton will not find life as a member of GekkoState as fun or easy as he originally thought.

This is a brief summary of the first five episodes of this show, which are on this DVD.  For any fan of anime, I suggest this DVD. Eureka Seven is a great show that grows on you, it's strongest aspect is it's character development, but you have to watch the episodes to see this.  The show has action, and at times can be heart warming, yet heart wrenching at the same time.

As previously stated, this DVD has the first 5 episodes of the show in either English or Japanese, with an interveiw from the Japanese voice actors for Renton and Eureka, they also provide commentary for one of the episodes. This DVD introduces many, but not all of the main characters, and simply gets the story rolling. Again, I only offered a brief explanation of the story, but if you buy the DVD you'll get a better idea of what it's all about, and I think and hope you'll enjoy it.",1172016000,,2033,4.476964769647696
2485866,3,B000E3L7BE,"I know what some, if not most of you, are thinking... 3 STARS?  I have seen the entire series, all the way to its conclusion.  I decided to write this review to give a little warning about what could have been one of the best anime mecha shows in the last few years.

So... to start with I will have to say the first DVD here is very good, there are very few things that detract from the first 5 episodes of this series.  The only thing I could say about it is the pacing in the begining is slow but you will realize later why it is paced in such a way.  The characters, dialogue, and story arc is very well thought out here in the begining and I enjoyed watching it immensely.

Now my review of the rest of the series is why I am writing this today.  The first ""season"" of Eureka Seven ( 1-26 ) is an incredible roller coaster ride that will both dazzle you and take you to places you wouldn't have considered before.  The second half of the series however is an INCREDIBLE dissapointment.  What was strong in the first season is weak in the second.  Strangely, also some episode budgets must have been cut in the second season as I could see marked difference in quality between episodes.  By far some of the worst episodes are in the second half of the show and I cannot begin to tell you how bad they are without possibly spoiling part of the story for you which I am loathe to do.  The story potential that was in the first half of Eureka Seven with its mysteries and life lessons are concluded badly and at times forgotten about in the second half, basically meaning the show felt like they were creating the ending as they were releasing episodes.  This generally works well in episodic shows but with such buildup, character developement, and mystery that was in the first half this does not work here.  To be honset if it was not for the first half I doubt I would have been able to finish watching the second, it was that painful to watch at times.

I wrote this review to warn you what will be coming ahaed and to say that Eureka Seven is an excellent anime with an unfortunate finish.  I am not saying do not watch this show but to just be a little wary of the second half, it could have been so much better.",1168387200,4,2220,4.212765957446808
2485867,5,B000E3L7BE,"I hopefully won't give away too many spoilers.
I had seen a few episodes of Eureka Seven on Adult Swim, but I remained skeptical.  [...] Yes, Eureka Seven has its own wikipedia page.
I eventually bought this special edition since I figured I would end up buying the soundtrack at some point, and I figured the shirt and box were nice too.  Oh, by the way, the view of the shirt the product image shows is the back of the shirt.  The front of the shirt has the Gekkostate emblem in the top left.  After reading Courtland J. Carpenter's review in which he describes Gekkostate as being more like a terrorist cell, I was kinda surprised at the shirt.  I love my shirt, by the way.
As for the show itself, well, you'll be proud to wear the Gekkostate emblem as well because Gekkostate is just awesome.  While being deadly serious at times, Renton permeates the show with a youthful optimism that is infectious.  One of the major themes throughout the show is the idea and importance of choice as well as being loyal to the ones who matter.  Additionally, be prepared to see characters face the consequences of their actions and choices.
There's something very special about this series and the characters in it.  The characters all have their own histories and backgrounds, and very few of them seem flat.  Even Dewey has a certain aristocratic air about him even though he comes across as very easily despicable.  Eureka may remind some viewers of Cheza from Wolf's Rain, but I caution that even Eureka has her own past and pain.  In one sense, this makes her more real.  In another sense, it may make viewers attach more strongly to her.  If a viewer grows attached to Eureka, they will have some strong feelings later in the series which may reflect the viewer's own personality and traits of character.  Will someone despise her, pity her, or maybe agree with Renton that taking a stand is the right thing to do?
I will leave potential viewers with this in mind.  One Sunday morning, I was watching the second episode on the disc while mulling over what to speak on that night at church.  I was responsible for the evening's Communion meditation.  The episode's opening scene with Renton and his falling predicament made me think about a message:

""Make a choice, commit to it, and see it through.  Don't be afraid to get out and take a risk for the ones you care about.  Take a risk; make a choice; stand up and be counted for something that matters.  After all, that's what Christ did when he committed his life to us on the cross at Calvary.  That's one of the reasons we remember His spilt blood and broken body when we partake in Communion.  He made a choice; he took a stand for us; He bled and died for us.  Is it really too much then, for us to take small risks in our own lives?  Is it too much for us to commit to those who matter to us?  Is it too much for us to find something to believe in and commit to it?  Christ committed to us, and we should commit to each other and to things in life that are worthwhile.""

If you let it, Eureka Seven will make you think, and you may be surprised what application that ends up having in your own life.  I know I was surprised.
Another person and I were discussing this later...
""Wait, you got the idea for tonight from that series you've been watching?""
""Yeah, but I'll never admit it to (the pastor, name withheld).""

2485868,5,B000E3L7BE,"I love the show the first few episodes maybe a little slow for some people, but it picks up later in the series. With out the first few episodes you lose some of the character of the show.

I love the shirt and were it all the time.

I love reading manga of the anime series I watch. This actually adds to the whole experience. I definitely would recommend this special edition DVD to anyone that likes Mech Anime",1163030400,,413,4.215189873417722
2485869,4,B000E3L7BE,"First of all I should confess that I love this series (I didn't see dubbed version yet) like most of other anime titles so far but the thing is,this kind of plot line is getting a little bit ordinary. If you've seen ""Neon Genesis"" or ""Rahxephon"" or ... You'll understand what I mean. A normal boy who becomes a legend, a legend who regains his faith & believes after he lost them (You always hear in this genre this dialogues:Who am I? What am I doing here? & ...) & the one who changes the world's destiny by his hands...

But anime is anime & I can't stop myself from loving it.

I'm sure you'll find enough comments about the story & other stuffs here,so no need to explain them all again here.

Just I want to say the 3 1st seasons songs are among best musics I've ever heard in my life so don't miss them fans.

Enjoy",1152057600,2,822,4.150943396226415
2485870,5,B000E3L7BE,"Wow! That is all I could say after watching the first five episodes  of Eureka 7. I first watched them as Japanese with Enligh subs but even when watching as English dubs the show was just as moving. Many anime have predictable almost clliche main characters and love stories. But Eureka 7 is far from it. The main character (Renton Thurston) is the son of a national hero. The only thing he cares about is lifting. He doesn't seem that good at it either. However, he overcomes his shortcomings in lifting while trying to attatch the Amita Drive to the Nirvash. He has character flaws just like a real person. The girl for which he falls for also has flaws. Eureka never shows strong emotions and rarely smiles or laughs. But Renton seems to change that. Now the series is pretty good sized so expect a lot of character development. However, don't expect the kind of mecha battles you would see in Neon Genesis Evangelion because the series are very different. I hope you like Eureka 7 because I know I did!",1151539200,,1007,4.532967032967033
2485871,5,B000E3L7BE,"Young Renton is sick of his life in a do nothing town, slaving away for his cranky mechanic grandpa. The only joy he gets is riding his ref board, a device used to surf the trapar winds, energy waves in the air. He dreams of joining Gekkostate, a rebel organization that lives to defy the official city governments. Not only are they a bastion of counter-culture, they are also a symbol to the young to go against the system and live their lives on their own terms. Of course, the government's main priority is to crush them. That's what they're in the course of doing when a mecha, called an ""LFO"", crashlands on Renton's home! Once he gets over the initial shock, his emotions run the other way, when a strange but beautiful looking young girl named Eureka steps out of its hatch. Renton is instantly a slave of love! The forces of Gekkostate have come to Renton's grandfather in search of a device called an ""Amita Drive"" which grants an LFO incredible powers and was created by Renton's dad, who is currently missing and presumed dead after saving the world. Will Renton's dreams finally be fulfilled even as he falls deeper in love and gets a reality check when he meets the rest of the Gekko's crew?

The premise of Eureka 7 is a little dumb. I mean, a show about surfing mecha??  I guess back in the 90's around the peak of surfer culture in America, this show would have been seen as cool, but now it seems a little silly.  But the execution by Bones, the studio behind Full Metal Alchemist and Wolf's Rain, pulls off a major coup by actually making this anime great! I don't know really how they succeeded, but it mostly comes down to great animation along with some great characters. There are reaction shots and displays of emotion that are only seen in real live actors. For example, when Renton learns that Eureka is a ""mom"" for the first time, there is just this static shocked reaction shot for a long couple of seconds as some banal info scrolls over his head, but it works like the best comedy. The Japanese voice acting is superb and is some of the best I've ever heard. Great show so far!

The extras include an interview with the Japanese actresses who play Renton and Eureka and they also do an audio commentary for Episode 1. There is also a clean opening.",1150070400,,2278,4.46875
2485872,5,B000E3L7BE,"Studio Bones are usually credited with high quality works (Wolf's Rain, Rahxphon, Fullmetal Alchemist, Phantom Memory Kurau) but on this outing, Eureka Seven, their first 100% original work, they've outdone not only themselves, but seemingly almost every other anime studio today. Directed by Tomoki Kyoda (assistant Director on Rahxephon) and writing supervised by Dai Sato (assistant writer in shows such as Samurai Champloo or Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex) Eureka Seven stars Renton Thurston as your regular 14 year old craving a more exciting life, but when a beautiful young girl piloting a giant mech, and his Idol Holland all crash land at his house, his journey into the mysteries of the planet begins. The basic backdrop of Eureka Seven takes the traditional mold of Mecha anime, such as the original Gundam, and refines it to the point that it once again seems fresh and new, the actual plot of the show is beautiful but hard to put into words without spoiling due to it's structure and leisurley pace which emphasize character development that is invaluable to the plot progression. The series features outstanding direction, especially in terms of action scenes, for anyone who has doubts about the concept of ""surfboarding giant robots,"" they only need to the incredibly shot action scenes that feature terifically fluid movement almost unheard of in TV anime. The show is smartly written, making it accesible to a wide range of audiences, the characters act in a very real fashion and are given credble reasons for their actions, the emotional factor throughout the show can be very intense and is never portrayed in a forced fashion. Outstanding work all around.

The first 5 episodes of Eureka Seven, out of 50 episodes, set the stage for an imaginative and emotional journey that will, no doubt in my mind, leave it's mark in you. I cannot reccomend this series enough, as in my opinion it encapsulates the very best in anime, a wonderful cast of characters, a creative story and gorgeous animation and music.",1149897600,,2036,5.005899705014749

The edition itself is so beautiful, it comes with the first five episodes, a t-shirt, the first volume of the manga, and the original soundtracks 1 CD, all in one beautiful box.
Just make sure you check out the box right after you unseal it, do it on a table or a low height from the ground, because if you hold it from the wrong place, it may open and cause the items inside to fall on the ground while you're holding only the upper part of the box, that actually happened to me, but thank God it wasn't harmed.",1433980800,,634,4.0396825396825395

Eureka Seven is a nice take on mecha, surfing, and pirate/rebels going against the controlling power.  Looking forward to watching and reading this again very soon.",1397692800,,473,5.0256410256410255

It is engrossing and you can get invested in the characters without fear of them going poof by the end. I think the ending was pretty good to and like how they left it so that it could continue. I like a story that has a happy ending. I would though recommend seeing it from the start to finish and not trying to watch out of order.,1376870400,,496,3.872549019607843
