8005163,4,B00011CZQA,"John Romer does a good solid job in this one of his earliest films. The only real compliant I have is that it is way too short. It is a very meaty subject (The New Testament and its early history) that could of easily have been explored further. That and the photography was not up to his usual standards.

Hopefully he will come back to this subject soon and in DVD format! I can recommend highly his other films, ""The 7 Wonders of the World"" and ""Byzantium"".",1100736000,3,460,4.287356321839081
8005164,5,B00011CZQA,"This series is great, and John Romer is someone who breates life into history.  I think many Christians are afraid of comparing history objectively to their beliefs and bibles... afraid that some ""facts"" will undermine their beliefs somehow... but what Romer reveals enhances the meaning and beauty of the bible, and it's clear from the first episode that he has great reverence for the bible, and has pondered it extensively. In one episode, Romer traces the sources of the flood story; in another, he picks up a hair comb and piece of ancient glass from rubble and sand, and paints a picture of the ancient biblical era people who used these items.  Throughout the series, he introduces the viewer to obscure libraries and museums where the fragments and documents that were part of the chain in preserving scriptures and from which we get the words we use as the authority for the explanations scholars have debated for centuries.  He also introduces us to powerful church fathers, like Irenaeus, and Jerome, who made the first decisions that afected how we read the bible today; and he illuminates the debates people had even at the earlies times, over what should be included, how it should be ordered, and translated.  I hope that someday, this fascinating series will be reissued on DVD.",1073174400,10,1294,4.894977168949771
