2664557,3,B000J0I7HO,"This is a 70+ minute video which is a mix of cardio and weights, doing ""functional"" moves involving hand weights, a balance ball, and a resistance band. There are six ""drills"" which contain a cardio section, an upper body section, and a lower body section. It starts out intense and gets more and more intense as you go through the workout.

This video was a lot of fun to do. The time went by quickly and I had a great time with the sections that I didn't find exceeding my abilities. I especially loved the sections of the workout where I got to ""play"" with the balance ball - throwing it up in the air, bouncing it on the floor, tossing it around, etc. However, I did find a lot of the workout to be too high impact for my tastes. For example, the ski hops and bunny hops on and off the step were just too much for me.

I think of this as a ""softer"" Boot Camp, so if Boot Camp is a little too rough or ""manly"" for you, you'd like this workout. It is a space hog, though, there are walking lunges and some other lateral moves that require a lot of space. There is also a section of the video where you use the balance ball against a wall, which I would prefer not to do. There are no alternate moves for the wall section, and Cathe doesn't offer low intensity options for the majority of the high intensity moves.

Overall, I give this video 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. It loses points for the high intensity sections with no low intensity options and the wall section with no other options.",1172188800,21,1487,4.174216027874564
2664558,5,B000J0I7HO,"I really like this workout.  If you are a Cathe fan, it is pretty different from any other workout that she had done.  The closest thing to it is Boot Camp.  Both videos are good in separate ways.  Boot Camp is only one hour and seems to concentrate more on strength work.  Drill Max has a lot more cardio in it.  And I found it to be a pretty tough go, but mixed up enough where it was enjoyable.  I intend to do this one regularly.  I would say however that this is a pretty advanced workout.",1163116800,17,494,4.020618556701031
2664559,4,B000J0I7HO,"I usually love Cathe's workouts.  I like this, but not as much as her others.  This is quite effective (if you can make it through to the end), but usually with interval training, you pick up the intensity and lower it only to pick it up again.  Here you are pretty much going full tilt the entire way.  I don't really classify this as interval training.

Having said that, you will get a great workout from this.  In the six circuits (that each have three segments), you will work on balance, agility and functional fitness.  You will need to be somewhat fit already in order to do this because otherwise you will find it very discouraging and may quit.  Each of the segments within the circuits do step aerobics, floorwork and standing toning.  Even she will tell you that if you don't have a lot of space to work in (cause you'll do football drills) then 'take it higher'.  So she is one tough cookie, but she will give you results if you do this consistantly.

You are looking at a workout well over an hour.  But while it's tough and makes you sweat, I just wouldn't call it interval training.  Her instruction and cuing are as good as ever and I think that if you are fit or somewhat fit already, you will have lot's to gain from this.  I really like it.",1162425600,10,1260,4.329059829059829
2664560,5,B000J0I7HO,"This is one of my favorite Cathe DVD's, and I own almost all of them (and there really isn't one I DONT like!).  You sweat like a madman and it's easy to follow. I love the circut training on this and I alternate it with some of her other muscle building DVD's ie. Muscle Max, Hour of Power etc. to build muscle at a more intense level. It's a strong cardio workout and there is always room to modify if you need to (which you will at first, especially if your a beginner). You certainly get out of it what you put into it, but I know when I put this DVD in I'm going to get an excellent workout, no question! Just push yourself to the limit and earn the body you deserve!",1211500800,3,672,4.014925373134329
2664561,5,B000J0I7HO,"As a former college middle distance runner not much impresses me by way of workout videos! Cathe is the only one that does it for me. Of course you get what you make of it but if you put in the effort with her you'll feel and see the results.

Only draw back is the extra equipment you need to buy but it tells you what you need on the DVD",1210291200,,339,3.7746478873239435
2664562,5,B000J0I7HO,"This is the first of Cathe dvds that I have worked out to.  I was so impressed with the intensity, variety and ease of moves that I went online and ordered several more dvds.  This dvd is not for the faint of heart. It is labeled advanced and rightly so.  It is comprised of a series of ever increasingly difficult high energy drills(thus the name drill max) that keep your heart pumping and give your body a great workout.  The good thing, if you are not up to doing all of the drills just go to the menu and choose the ones you feel like doing.  This feature offers great flexibility in how you approach your workout.  I recommend this dvd.",1194652800,,642,4.264462809917355

2664564,5,B000J0I7HO,"Whoever said this was a ""softer version"" of boot camp seriously got it wrong. I have been working out with Cathe for over a year now and although I own many of her workouts including drill max there has never been a time when I was not either challenged or that I have felt completely rewarded. Is the intensity high impact and fast paced, of course because how boring would it be for her to stop and show modifications or go on and on about how to modify every step. Does she tell you how to modify? No, because here is the thing don't jump as high, don't jump as far, drop the weight, don't go as low!!!!! You can modify as needed and I seriously doubt that the advanced exerciser needs someone telling them this. This workout will continue to challenge you in every way, cariovascular, muscular endurance, stamina, and agility. Cathe and her crew are an inspiration and everytime I workout with them I am more and more amazed.",1186963200,4,929,4.43859649122807
2664565,5,B000J0I7HO,"After Butts & Guts, this is my favorite workout of Cathe's latest series. This circuit workout as produced is 72 minutes long, during which Cathe puts you through six drill cycles:

Warmup

Drill #1:
Cardio #1
Squat & Curl
Upper Body

Drill #2:
Cardio #2
Plie Squats
Scapular Retractions
Bombdiver/Plank Pushups

Drill #3:
Cardio #3
Lunges
Wall Squats
Curls on the Ball

Drill #4:
Cardio #4
Firewalkers
Glute Squeezes on the ball
Upper Body

Drill #5:
Cardio #5
Walking Lunges
Shoulders on ball

Drill #6:
Cardio #6
Squat Thrust
Lunge/Power Scissors
Upper Body
Stretch

And, of course, with Cathe, you always get fantastic chaptering and premix options: Cardio Blast (39 min.), Ultra Cardio Blast (63.5 min.), Scrambled Cardio Blast (46 min.), Cardio/Leg Blast (57 min.), Cardio & All Upper Body (60 min.), Total Body (52 min.)

You'll need a stability ball, standard size step (Cathe & crew use one riser), a band, dumbbells, and yes, a little bit of floor space. In terms of just how much you'll need to move within your workout space, you'll do four walking lunges, then turn and repeat. In another cardio segment, you'll jump (feet together) or do a forward bound three times and turn.  There is some high-impact involved, but it can be modified, and you'll still get a great workout. Music is instrumental - not necessarily recognizable - but with a good beat.

I highly recommend this for people who want a solid athletic workout with simple choreography.",1183852800,5,1461,4.8983739837398375
2664566,3,B000J0I7HO,"I own almost all Cathe Friedrich videos ever made, including the original Step & Motion.

I have worked out to Cathe's videos for 10 years, and Drill Max is at the bottom of my favorite workout videos.

Here is why I don't care for Drill Max:

1.  The workout takes up way too much space.  Unless you have a lot of room and a free wall, this video will require modifications that take away enormously from the workout.

2.  Some moves (esp. the football runs) are very difficult do execute on carpet.

3.  This workout does not hold my attention -- I find it on the boring side.

4.  The stability ball is overused and actually causes my heartrate to lower too much during its use in the cardio sections.

5.  The music is not motivating.

The Pros:

Fantastic choice for the choreography challenged

Great Premix options

New and innovative moves, i.e., dive bomber pushups

Good choice for the intermediate exerciser ready to take their workouts to then next level

Cathe is a superb instructor -- very upbeat and motivating.

This is a great workout for building endurance.  The strength gains will be minimal for the more advanced exerciser.

If you want a great workout that is much more difficult, is shorter in duration, and does not take up a lot of space, then try Boot Camp.

If you want to sculpt and chisel, try Cathe's Gym Styles, Slow & Heavy, or Pure Strength series.

Drill Max is not a true weight workout.  I consider it to be a circuit workout that builds more endurance than anything.  It is not the best choice for those who want to sculpt their body or gain strength.

Some of the cardio is very difficult and some is beginner level, at best.

I know lots of people love Drill Max, but it is not for me as it does not fit into my fitness goals.

In summary, this video will strongly appeal to some exercisers and not to others.",1180051200,15,1849,4.435820895522388
2664567,5,B000J0I7HO,"This is my first Cathe Friedrich dvd and I love it! It provides a great boost to my workout schedule and is very challenging. If you're feeling overly energetic you can run the workout straight through (over 60 mins) or choose one of the shorter premixed workouts for different areas of concentration.

Great workout for intermediates who are looking for a push up to advanced.",1174521600,2,377,4.8
2664568,5,B000J0I7HO,"I loved it, however keep in mind, this workout is for someone who wants High intensity workouts and does not like alot of breaks.  She does give ample recovery for the muscle by switching back in forth non-stop.",1174435200,4,211,4.552631578947368
2664569,5,B000J0I7HO,This DVD is awesome!!! It tests my endurance like no other. I'm in better shape because of this workout and many other Cathe's DVDs. This is workout is definitely for advance exercisers. It's very athletic and not dancy at all... be ready to sweat. This DVD is like no other Cathe DVD...she includes lots of functional exercises. Great Job Cathe!!!,1172707200,5,348,4.816666666666666

8148235,5,B000J0I7HO,"This is an excellent workout. I have most of Cathe's DVDs, and this is one of my favorites. She keeps you motivated with her spot on cuing, it is fun, and a great addition to your collection to mix things up. I love the ball work!",1429574400,,230,4.021739130434782
8148236,5,B000J0I7HO,What I could view of the dvd was great; however I had to return it due to the fact that it was all scratched up and would skip.,1422921600,,127,3.5714285714285716
8148237,4,B000J0I7HO,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.

Another great workout from this instructor.  As usual, good cuing/tips without useless chit chat or annoying pep talk, great camera work, music ok, ""backup dancers"" non-annoying.

Ball cardio exercises suprisingly effective considering ball is not really heavy, it is just an effort in itself to hold such an awkwardly large object.  I used only free weights, ball, and step.  Substituted free weight exercises during band exercises (not a fan of the band.)  Step was not worth setting up and working around in limited space since it is not used very often or long.  Would have been better to skip the step and do more regular floor plyometrics.

Other than that, worked up a major sweat and got a decent sculpting and cardio workout.",1314144000,,799,5.0
8148238,5,B000J0I7HO,"Like most Cathe workouts, this one is filled with unique moves that keep your heart pumping.  Challenging and fun.",1281398400,,114,5.0
8148239,4,B000J0I7HO,"Even if you are not in the best shape this DVD delivers a great workout with simple combination drills and some light weight training, at the end is like Cathe said, ""You get what you put into"".",1268438400,,194,4.27027027027027
8148240,5,B000J0I7HO,"I own all of Cathe's DVD's except for her earliest productions that are only available on VHS, and this is one of my favorites.  It's an extremely tough and advanced workout, but Cathe makes it so much fun.  Just be sure that you enjoy doing circuit-style workouts before ordering this one since it's a combination of cardio and weights.

What is really nice about this workout, too, is that Cathe focuses on functional movements, such as those that are used in everyday life.

To do this workout, you should have a step (although you can modify the workout if you don't have a step), some dumbbells, and a stability ball.

Just writing about this workout is leaving me itching to do it since it's so  much fun.  Great music and Cathe's upbeat attitude make this one a sweat fest!

UPDATED ON 10/18/09:  I wanted to point out a few things I forgot to mention in my initial review.  First, the step choreography in this workouts is really basic since the workout focuses on athletic-style drills, so don't let the stepping scare you if you're not a step person.  Second,  by the time you finish this workout, you'll have worked every major muscle group; the only group not given separate attention is the abs/core, but you use them in many of the exercises.  Finally, circuit workouts like this one will help burn fat and maintain the muscle mass you already have, but they won't help you put on muscle.  For that, try Cathe's Gym Styles or Slow and Heavy or 4 Day Split workout series.  Hope that helps!",1255651200,4,1503,4.5767790262172285
8148241,4,B000J0I7HO,"This is a challenging workout; however, if you are not familiar with step routines, it can get confusing. I have to stop and restart when it becomes ""dancey"" and try to figure out what the move is. I have been able to complete the entire workout and I definitely work up a sweat. This is a great workout for anyone who enjoys step aerobics.",1252886400,,340,4.328125
8148242,5,B000J0I7HO,"This is one of the hardest home workout DVD's out there.  It is a cardio circut, interval training workout.  You will do cardio on and off the step, use weights for upper and lower body, and you will work your core throughout the entire DVD, they get no downtime.  There are some really great premixes on this that make it well worth your money.",1223510400,2,345,4.359375
