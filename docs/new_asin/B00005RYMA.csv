7952804,5,B00005RYMA,"I played this movie side by side with the other version offered by Amazon and rated NR.  They are both the same.  This appears to me to be the NR version rather than the R version as Amazon lists it.  This version has the scene that someone here says is missing from the R version.  The resolution is better on this version also.  And the data file - video file - is larger on this version which would indicate to me that this is indeed has better resolution.  There are extras on the other version offered on this site, but those extras only consist of 25 seconds of photo captures of the video as well as a one paragraph synopsis in Spanish of the movie.  And even with those extras on the other DVD, the data file is still smaller which would indicate to me lower resolution given the smaller data file.  The other edition is cheaper, as of this writing, but it is lacking in detail.  Not as sharp.  The movie, itself, is good though.  It's good erotica.",1384732800,,957,4.290502793296089
7952805,5,B00005RYMA,"Soft core version of ""Indecent Proposal.""  The story starts out slow, but once it moves, a lot of actions immediately emerge.  Kira Reed, my favorite and Janine Lindenmalder make a good pair in this, yet another excellent title released by EROS.  A title not to be missed if you want story and real actions.",1026777600,4,307,4.648148148148148
7952806,3,B00005RYMA,"the acting is fair and the love scenes are top notch-beware of the r rated version; it cuts everything! if youve seen it, the first love scene on the car-transcends into the bedroom![which cuts that part out]",939427200,17,208,4.648648648648648
