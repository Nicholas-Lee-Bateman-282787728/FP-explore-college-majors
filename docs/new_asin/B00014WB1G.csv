1971404,5,B00014WB1G,I feel a kinship to the barbarians. The ate and drank anything. Killed and mamed innocent people. Belched very loudly. I felt like I was watching a home movie from my childhood.,1180310400,5,177,4.5625
1971405,5,B00014WB1G,"I have heard some people criticize the accuracy of the documentary, and they may well be right. However, I for one have a much much better knowledge of the Vikings, Huns, Mongols, and Goths after watching the documentary. It was very very entertaining, dramatizations were excellent in my opinion. I would highly recommend this DVD. If you like medieval history and want to learn more, then read some books. However if you're like me and enjoy the visual aid and lack infinite time to read all the different histories then this is a great place to get your feet wet.",1178841600,5,566,4.67
1971406,3,B00014WB1G,"I want to respond to the many posts about the ethnicity of the Great Khan. For the record, many of those who are having a hissy fit over him being presented as a caucasiod are doing so out of ignorance. Arab chroniclers described him in great detail: red hair, fairly large (6 footish), green eyes and fair skin. The same goes for Tamerlane (Timur the Lame) more or less. There are several books that describe this. And his hordes weren't all Asiatics because many were descendants of the Sarmatians and even earlier the Scythians who were the first horse culture in basically the same region. They were blondes and dressed much like the later Germanic tribes as did the Sarmatians and a recent discovery in western China - the Tocharians (blondes & Nordic, Germanic-Celtic weaving/clothing, quite tall) - more commonly referred too as the 'Tarim Basin Mummies'. Both PBS and Discovery have DVDs and VHS tapes on this discovery as does the Journal of Indo-European Studies covers it.

The DVD was all right. I've seen better.",1165536000,66,1025,4.823863636363637
1971407,5,B00014WB1G,"Overall, it is a good dvd that in less than 4 hours puts the viewer in a time and space context.

If you listen to the story it tells rather than look for mistakes (wether the race of the actors is correct, etc) you'll start to conect names of tribes (huns, vikings, etc.) and dates with other civilizations that are better known (romans, etc).

Take a look at it.",1149984000,15,364,4.260869565217392
1971408,5,B00014WB1G,"Don't knock this series. This is good stuff, and I know until I can get this collection if I see one episode from it on the History Channel I will record it; I've always wanted to know more about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, and this series gives a rather good detail about the whole fall. I know I would like to know the creul and vicious emperor that started the fall in 180 a.d., but I'm sure that's for another time. In the meantime this is good enough.",1148860800,7,470,4.119565217391305
1971409,3,B00014WB1G,"So, okay -- having Mongols depicted by actors who could have been anything from Hispanic to Caucasian and certainly not ""authentic"" Asians is relatively horrible, considering there cannot be a dearth of Asian/Asian-American actors who could have portrayed Genghis (or JENgis, as several of the historical experts were calling him in the program) far more realistically.

Still, the History Channel did a commendable job of exploring the histories of the Vikings, Huns, Mongols, and Goths in this program.  While I cannot verify whether all the information provided is completely accurate, I doubt there are as many hugely glaring errors as other critics would make one believe.

My only disappointment is that there were still unanswered questions about several things after having watched this series.  The name HUN -- is it related to the HAN dynasty of China that drove them westward...?  And what's the difference between an Ostrogoth and a Visigoth -- geography alone, or more?

How did Kublai Kahn fit into the blood-drenched history of the Mongols?

Finally, I would have liked seeing even a little coverage of other barbarous European tribes such as the Vandals, Gauls, Picts, Angles, Saxons, and Burgundians.

At the end of the day ""Barbarians"" presents a decent documentary on a subject heretofore not covered and I found it largely enjoyable and educational.",1128988800,44,1369,5.247706422018348
1971410,1,B00014WB1G,"I bought this DVD after watching the DVD of ""Spartans"" by PBS.  I was really in the mood for another great history show.  However, what I got was simply awful.

  To start with, I can't stand the overly dramatic narrator, who tries to imbue every syllable with ominous overtones.  His narration is extremely poorly written, it sounds like a script from a B movie.

  The shows are also filled with innumerable blunders, an example of which is that in showing a map of the Viking's homeland of Scandinavia, it completely leaves out the territory of present day Denmark, even though the Danes were a major part of the Viking age.

  Then of course, there are the horrible historical re-ennactments, which though copious, are also innacurate.  Mongols, Tatars, and Arabs are all portrayed by Caucasion actors and actresses.  I find it mind boggling that they couldn't even find actors of the right ethnicity to play an important historical figure like Ghenghis Khan.

  Anyone looking to buy a History Channel DVD should think twice and then get one of PBS's excellent productions.",1104710400,21,1078,4.9
1971411,2,B00014WB1G,Viewers who object to the Caucasian actors in this series portraying Mongols should take a look at the classic whopper of the genre--John Wayne as Genghis Khan!,1081123200,7,160,4.962962962962963
1971412,1,B00014WB1G,"The use of Caucasian actors to play Mongolians-especially Genghis Khan- has effectively discredited the History Channel as nothing more than mindless entertainment. If they are so careless about this obvious aspect of history, then what other lies are they tying to pass off as historical truth? This is no different than yellow-faced white actors in any horrid asian themed movies way back in those less ""progressive"" times. The Barbarian series should be categorized as dim-witted entertainment and not educational.",1080604800,9,517,5.556962025316456
1971413,5,B00014WB1G,"I have viewed many documentaries and this one is great if you want to know more about those groups considered to be barbarians by those civilizations that they attacked.  Truth be told, they weren't and this set helps in explaining these groups.  It will not give you everything about each group, but it does give you some good history to base a solid opinion on.",1301270400,,363,4.569230769230769
1971414,3,B00014WB1G,Same problem with History Channel videos---repeating the same scenes too often to eat up time.  Historically I do like the references and the impact in modern history.,1296691200,,167,5.185185185185185
1971415,5,B00014WB1G,"Excellent collection.

This is how history should be presented in school. This makes learning a pleasant experience. My daughthers liked it a lot and after watching each show I helped them do do some further reading on the internet.

I wish I could find something like that for math to help my kids.",1283126400,,299,4.622641509433962
1971416,1,B00014WB1G,"This review is of the DVDs, not the show.

Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But the DVDs are actually non-anamorphic letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap, direct-to-video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.

If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.

Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century.",1261526400,,873,4.619354838709677
1971417,1,B00014WB1G,"Reading some of the other reviews, perhaps I should not regret so much that this is yet another shoddy History Channel product without subtitles.  It's not a theatrical production.  It's narrated for goodness' sake.  How can they manage NOT to subtitle these documentaries?",1254441600,4,273,5.3023255813953485
1971418,5,B00014WB1G,"As a high-school teacher for history and English foundations, I must utilize movies as a visual aide supplement to help them connect with the characters, setting, dialogue... I strongly recommend using this dvd to support your curriculum to teach on all levels of student learning (auditory, kinesthetic, visual).",1230076800,3,313,5.541666666666667

1971420,5,B00014WB1G,"After viewing the PBS series on barbarians I purchased this and other DVDs and VHS tapes regarding this interesting part of human history.  It is an education to learn the part played by so many barbaric, warring peoples, helping to put historic sequences in place.  In fact, there were some barbaric peoples I had not heard of; others I could not place geographically.  This is an important addition to my historic video collection.  I recommend it highly to those interested history in general and barbarian peoples in particular.",1215993600,2,532,5.011363636363637
1971421,5,B00014WB1G,"I love this series.  It combines reenactments with expert historians' interviews, pulling the viewer into the past and making it seem like the present.  It's pop history.  What of it?  It gets you interested and encourages you to explore issues that interest you.  What struck me the most is these barbarians were brutalized by their neighboring empires, and had to develop guerrilla tactics to compete successfully.  Rome, for instance, wanted everyone and everything to bow down to it.  Why was its culture more important than the other ones?  Eventually, the conquering hordes made peace with their enemies and accepted their gods in order to get along and assimilate.  Perhaps there's a little barbarian in all of us.",1211932800,2,721,5.094017094017094
1971422,5,B00014WB1G,"Well, I've always liked the History Channel's documentaries over the years and this is one of my favorite productions. The only thing I'll say about buying it is that the episodes are too short with commercial lapses built into their structure--by this I mean they'll fade out of a scene and then fade back via the repetition of a small segment of tape. This can get a little annoying if you're watching them all in a row. The fact is though, I don't have time to read separate books on the Vikings, the Huns, and the Visigoths so I appreciate the insight that this collection provides. They're well done and very educational. I'm not sure why some people reviewed them so poorly here.",1187222400,11,685,4.5772357723577235

8006554,4,B00014WB1G,"History speaks of warrior cultures from a soldier's point of view as a war fought in a civilized fashion.  Now I realized to every established empire in history that to that culture, the invaders were referred to that culture as being barbarians.  Ancient Persia referred to Alexander The Great's army as being barbarians.  The Romans were brought by Christianity, as being barbaric.  In the ""quote-un-quote"" barbarians, they referred themselves as being civilized warriors.",1430524800,,474,5.4520547945205475
8006555,5,B00014WB1G,"This complete series is absolutely a great educational tool for all who want to know better the European history during the ""dark ages"".  It provides a great explanation of the other civilizations and cultures around the Romans who populated the northern Europe and their growth and raise to power while the Roman Empire debilitated in the West (Constantinople became the cradle of the Catholic Orthodox churches leaving many examples of Byzantine art and architecture across from Albania to Romania).
The structure of the series is by tribe and it is weaved chronologically providing an excellent educational background to understand more about these groups.",1420070400,,659,5.398058252427185

8006557,3,B00014WB1G,This is a very informative history.  Its worth purchasing for those who like a bit of history. It is worth the money.  This has to be watched and re-watched in a timely fashion.,1339804800,,177,4.333333333333333
8006558,5,B00014WB1G,"I must say that when I bought the 4 DVD set of ""Barabarians"" I expected interesting but somewhat dry material with college professor types talking and some drawings and perhaps paintings depicting the various hordes under review. I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find out that the History Channel actually went to various locations around Europe and filmed actors portraying the hordes, the peasants, etc. In other words, this is as close to an actual glimpse and re-enactment of this period as you will ever see. Only Hollywood could top this set. There are 8 hordes represented and each horde runs about 45 minutes so there are 2 hordes per DVD.

I learned A LOT about the period from 400 AD to 1300 AD when the Huns pressed into Eastern Europe and displaced tribes that fled from their advance and in doing so, became the ""Barbarians"" (e.g. Goths/Vandals/Lombards/etc.). You also get the Vikings, Saxons, and Mongols who all came a bit later but were no less influential in shaping modern day Europe.

This is a part of history that was never covered in my public education. I guess it was just too dark and bloody. Ironic that the Black Death in 1349 actually ended the ""Dark Ages"" and ""reset"" Europe by killing about half the population.

It is sad that the History Channel has had to branch into ""popular entertainment"" to stay afloat so I expect less of these type of ""magnum opus"" productions in the future. So snap this up while you still can!!!!",1330819200,,1457,4.705882352941177
