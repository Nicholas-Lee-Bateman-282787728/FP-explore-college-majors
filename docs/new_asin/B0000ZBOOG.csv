1961364,3,B0000ZBOOG,"Vampire Sisters is third in a sequence of collaboration between Joe Ripple and Don Dohler, starting with Harvesters and then Stakes.  As a low budget indie, this movie is really good. It's sexy, bloody, scary, ....
But, the highlight to me is the closing sequence (under the credits) which I believe is outstanding even by big budget standards. I won't spoil it by describing it here. It's just completely great - although you need to have seen at least the start of the movie to get the full impact.  It's one of the most masterful pieces of video and audio editing I've ever seen.",1075680000,2,582,4.586538461538462

8004727,5,B0000ZBOOG,"I had not seen any of Maria Beatty's films before seeing this. Iam not a fan of either ""adult"" films...or fetish films. The unusual atmosphere created in this film, sucked me into it's aura. Being male, and not fan of lesbian film encounters, I was surprised at my reaction to the proceedings. The two ladies seemed to be very much enamored, and were extremely erotic to watch. I understand that Ms. Beatty's films are fashioned after German expressionism, Weimar era, and American film noir styles. Well bravo at the execution as demonstrated here! I will seek out other examples to watch!",1358121600,,590,4.851485148514851
8004728,2,B0000ZBOOG,"""Vampire Sisters"" is a terrible horror film made quickly and cheaply in Director Joe Ripple's house. The film is the brainchild of the team of Ripple and the late Don Dohler, the master of extremely low-budget filmmaking, famous in B-movie circles for such films as ""The Alien Factor."" Some of Dohler's films are entertaining for their camp value, but ""Vampire Sisters"" is not one of them. Dohler produced and wrote this one while Ripple took the directorial duties. Dohler was a soft-spoken man, and at one point took a long sabbatical from movies; this was made after his time off, and the pause for reflection didn't help in this case.

The plot is actually pretty creative: three sisters who happen to be vampires set up a sultry website to lure victims to their house. This process works well until finally a couple (Mark C. Lassise and Leanna Chamish) take on the sisters. Along the way Dohler fans will recognize one victim as George Stover, who has, I believe, been in every Dohler film ever made. While the basic premise of the Internet being used for evil is great, it's largely wasted with a lame script, terrible acting, and pitiful special effects. The drill to Ripple's eye came off satisfactorily, but the remainder of the effects were laughable, especially the enormously long CGI tongue that was featured extensively in the ""Making of"" short. The film has lots of padding, and the pace is plodding. (Vampire scrapbooking, anyone?) Another issue for me was that I didn't find the three principal characters especially attractive, which was somewhat key given the plot. The best looking cast member was Chamish, who would have better served as one of the sisters. I was amused at the fight scenes between the sisters and Lassise which was a strictly fangs versus mop handle affair (don't ask,) which took us to the ultimate conclusion of the film. Other distractions also abound: a character living in the shed is alluded to throughout the film, but only in the closing scenes do we discover that it is Iggy (Steven ""Proz"" Prosser,) the dimwitted but protective brother of the vampires.

The closing credits of this film are the most grotesque part of the entire movie. They feature George Stover preparing for his date by trimming his eyebrows and nose hair and flossing to the rhythm of sexy music. This might make you laugh, but it also might make you want to gouge your eyes out, so exercise extreme caution. The rhythmic nose hair extraction does highlight a bigger issue with the film, namely its lack of focus. It never was clear what the film was setting out to do: was it strictly horror? Comedy? Satire? None of the above? Only after watching the commentary with Dohler and Ripple were the filmmaker's visions clear. The film is really worth one star (at best) but I gave it two because the commentary track is more interesting than the film itself, a common trend with Dohler. I really like and appreciate Dohler's vision to make independent films with a tiny budget, and from what I know of him, he seemed like a genuinely kind and good guy, and it shows in the extras. While I don't recommend this film to most people, fans of ultra-cheap independent video might find this of interest, and certainly Dohler aficionados will find it worthwhile, mostly for the commentary.",1302652800,,3298,4.794376098418278

8004730,1,B0000ZBOOG,"Another bad film with bad acting bad effects and just a bad plot. There not much here accept some nudity. Three vampire sisters lure men into there house through their sex web sight. Then of course eat suck their blood, how original. Then a cop gets on their tale and you know the rest of the story. A real bore fest. I bought this one and Vampire sisters 2. Both stunk. I will give Vampire Sisters 2 this it had a lot more nudity other than that these movies offer nothing new or cool. Bad film making at it's best.",1173744000,4,516,4.17
8004731,5,B0000ZBOOG,"What more could you ask for?  First, there is the imaginative idea of three female vampires using a webcam site to, not only produce an income, but also lure male victims to their lair.  In other words they pick winners, men who spend more than the others, to sup on.  The men think their fetish dreams will be answered.  And they ARE allowed to live just long enough to make them, and us - the viewers - happy just before they are killed in all kinds of very nasty ways.  Think Tool Time.

The three vampires, played by the cute Darla Albornoz, the tall Jeannie Michelle Jamseon and the very shapely Syn DeVil, are just the kind of vampires I would enjoy being drained by.  As long as they didn't use a saw to kill me.  Ew[...]

The women are pretty and their characters work well together, the outfits are fun - tight leather, little girl outfits, kinky footware - and there is enough humor to balance out the pools of fake blood.  There is some nudity but nothing to overcome the R rating of the movie.

Add a blooper reel, a making of featurette, a commentary and even the closing credits of the movie are fun to watch.  Dance, Darla, dance!  Just tons of fun!",1136073600,10,1164,4.333333333333333
8004732,1,B0000ZBOOG,"There's a difference between making a home movie and making a horror film. It seems the director may have forgotten this small detail as he had one of the vampire sisters spitting out all the blood she drank while showering (Why didn't she just swallow it instead of sensually bathing and letting it drip out of her mouth?) which was obviously cough syrup. This is not a serious movie. In fact, its a fine line between b porn and c movies. If you want to be teased and not see sex, and if you want to be lead on into thinking something could ever result from the poor acting and terrible story, don't see this. If you want a good laugh, please see it.",1124841600,18,651,4.258064516129032
