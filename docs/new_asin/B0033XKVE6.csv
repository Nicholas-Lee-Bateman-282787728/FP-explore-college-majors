4065660,5,B0033XKVE6,"A deeply moving tribute to Sendak, one of the world most cherished authors of childrens literature. This film offers a rare and personal look inside the life of Sendak.  The DVD includes great DVD Special Features including a Q&A with Spike Jones and Maurice Sendak at the Museum of Modern Art.",1266883200,9,294,4.764705882352941

4065662,5,B0033XKVE6,"A fascinating view of the inner life of Mr. Sendak, that I would definitely watch again.",1433721600,,88,4.5625
4065663,5,B0033XKVE6,"Maury Sendak is a legend, not only for his children's books, but for his sense of humor! Very interesting film, which showed the light-hearted and the rarely seen emotional side of Mr. Sendak. Great!",1433721600,,199,4.882352941176471
4065664,5,B0033XKVE6,"I just wish it were longer! Give me a 12 hour doc on Maurice Sendak, and then I'll be a happy camper. The whole film as a wonderful feeling to it and you really get the sense that Spike and Maurice had a great rapport. Loved every minute of it.",1433721600,,244,3.9
4065665,4,B0033XKVE6,"Here is Sendak - gloomy, funny, original like his work.",1432944000,,55,4.6
4065666,5,B0033XKVE6,A wonderful interview full of insights we really enjoyed this documentary.,1431129600,,74,5.818181818181818
4065667,4,B0033XKVE6,Hard to believe he was reclusive.  His work is magical for all ages.,1431043200,,68,4.230769230769231
4065668,5,B0033XKVE6,"...Murray (strike) Maurice is, and was, and the biography too. One comment said something about dark--no, he's witty, accomplished, sensitive... that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it, and a rare fabric this side of the pond.

Meanwhile, I'd not seen most of his other books, seems like each is different, but underneath, all filled with a child's heart and mind. The drawings of the true baby story he told were manifoldly genius. I'm so glad I watched this, made my day : )",1429660800,,477,4.678571428571429
4065669,3,B0033XKVE6,It's a little darker/creepy than I thought... (Maurice too)... but documentary-wise it was good and you learn something about the artist.  The Maurice Sendak set design for the Pacific Northwest Ballet production of Nutcracker is world-class/2nd-to-none!!  (in my opinion).  I haven't seen a Nutcracker production that has been able to match it.,1428710400,,345,5.596153846153846
4065670,5,B0033XKVE6,This was a really well done documentary.,1428451200,,40,4.857142857142857
4065678,5,B0033XKVE6,Wonderful.,1422144000,,10,10.0
4065679,5,B0033XKVE6,If you love Maurice Sendack this film gives you an sight into who he is from the man himself. It's a film portrait of him. A short intimate conversation with him. I enjoyed hearing the personality and history behind the name.,1420761600,,225,4.512195121951219
4065680,5,B0033XKVE6,Excellent little documentary. Sad and moving at times. I only wish it was longer.,1410307200,,81,4.857142857142857
4065681,4,B0033XKVE6,This is a quick snapshot into the world of Maurice Sendak.  He is obsessed with death and seems to be a bit negative about his own accomplishments.  He is also rather delightful.  The film does not go into great detail about his life.  We are just stopping by his house for a chat.,1407628800,,281,4.245283018867925
4065682,5,B0033XKVE6,"Sendak is more than the grandfather of the modern children's book. He was also a world class curmudgeon, and an intricate, wounded soul, whose personality is fully examined in the most loving way here. Spike Jonze, who turned the novelization of Sendak's ""Wild Things"" into one of the most heartfelt children's movies for grownups ever made, observes and engages Sendak with sensitivity and style. The highlight of the documentary has got to be Sendak's story about the Lindbergh baby, a fascinating study in the obsessiveness and fragility of a child's mind. ""Wild Things"" wasn't always the beloved classic it has become. Its long way from provocative boat-rocker to established childhood hallmark shows that an artist who is true to his obsessions, inspirations and fears can eventually create lasting, and fully accepted, beauty. Not that Maurice Sendak would've had the ability for self-forgiveness to ever celebrate such a triumph. His friendship with his housekeeper, his dog, and maybe Spike Jonze, may be the closest he ever came to feeling safe in this world. A beautiful portrait, and a fitting companion piece to Jonze's Wild Things adaptation.",1383177600,,1155,5.248648648648649
4065683,5,B0033XKVE6,"While I am well aware of his books, I had no idea who he was. Knowing something about the author helps me
better understand the books.",1374019200,,134,4.1923076923076925
4065684,5,B0033XKVE6,"Maurice Sendak steps forward in this video to share his unvarnished thoughts on life, children, parenting, and so much more.  Highly recommend that as many ""grownups"" view this one as possible!",1369958400,,193,5.225806451612903
4065685,4,B0033XKVE6,"I have been a Sendak fan for years, so I am biased. The video is put together from a number of interviews. It's very effective, we get his thoughts on a topic, like how to talk to kids, collected from 3 or 4 conversations. Sendak is a sweet guy, interesting and insightful. I gave the dvd 4 stars because the camera was handheld and very shaky. I get nauseated when the camera jiggles a lot. I think even for a hand held camera they could have done a better job. And while filming him in his house they could have used a tripod. I ended up feeling sick for the rest of the evening. Read the other reviews - people make good comments about the content. All in all it's a great video.",1365465600,,682,4.135338345864661
4065686,5,B0033XKVE6,"Haven't watch it yet, but I will later on, however, it has my favorite actor; James Gandolfini, because he got the voice of my favorite Wild Thing from Where The Wild Things Are movie, named Carol. Also...when Maurice Sendak got passed away by a very bad stroke since on May 8th of 2012, I do hope for a sequel and more movies of Where The Wild Things Are to happen, so all those movies could be a very special tribute and honor to Maurice Sendak, to honor him in his memory.",1361145600,,475,4.230769230769231
4065687,5,B0033XKVE6,"I cannot believe how quickly this order came and it's in perfect shape.  If you are a Maurice Sendak fan, you will love, love, love this video.  I can't say enough about it.",1360108800,,173,4.212121212121212
4065698,4,B0033XKVE6,"Really special dvd. The only thing is that the features doesn't have subtitles, so for a no english speaker is a little complicated to understand it.",1356912000,,149,4.769230769230769
4065699,5,B0033XKVE6,"This wonderful ""intimate portrait"" of bestselling children's author Maurice Sendak is a must have for fans. In it, the late author talks to film director Spike Jonze&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-the-Wild-Things-Are-Blu-ray/dp/B001HN699K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where the Wild Things Are [Blu-ray</a>] about his life, his art, and of course his views on kids.

You get to see some pictures of Sendak when he was young, his brother and sister, many of the drawings that he and his brother did while growing up, and includes wooden toys they created. You'll also get to hear what he thinks about his work and life, etc., and see pictures from his many children's books including those he only illustrated.

Sendak is really funny and personable, cursing every now and then, and seemed like a great character to hang around and have a drink with.

The cardboard box that the DVD comes housed in opens up with an illustration of Max and the Wild Things swinging on the trees from the book on one-side, on the other side a photo of Sendak lost in thought with his dog next to him, with a pair of legs and torso off to the left, and includes an essay by Tony Kushner.

Trailers for other Oscilloscope films

Anyway, this is definitely worth picking up.",1342569600,2,2336,5.8011695906432745
4065700,3,B0033XKVE6,"I had seen this film on HBO and I purchased it to screen for the seniors I work with as a social worker at a non-profit agency. The DVD arrived safely and was shrink wrapped. The main portion of the film was fine, but some parts of the bonus scenes (""extras"") were pixilated and corrupted, making portions of them unwatchable. I didn't think I would view that portion again anyway, though, so I just kept it and saved myself the hassle and expense of returning it.",1299196800,2,464,4.406976744186046
4065701,4,B0033XKVE6,"This is a documentary that features a 39-minute interview with the elderly Maurice Sendak at his home. It makes you appreciate how much more Sendak wrote and illustrated than simply his most famous book, ""Where the Wild Things Are.""

The children's book author does seem to go out of his way to be crusty during the interview, occasionally contradicting himself simply in order to establish himself as a free-spirited curmudgeon in the early innings of the chat. For example, he first attests to his dislike of families in general and to his family in particle. But then later he softens into expressions of gratitude towards and affection for many of his family members, especially his brother. It's as if he felt the need to come out fighting in order to strike his interviewer as being interesting and worthwhile, and in order to live up to the stereotype of all authors as being harshly eccentric.

So the main feature of this DVD is a little jagged and doesn't quite seem to reveal as much of the ""real"" Maurice Sendak as it might have. (Of course, that's assuming that there is a ""real"" Sendak, or a ""real"" any of us.)

However the bonus features on the disc are more consistently interesting and enlightening. Sendak comes across as a genuine ""mensch"" in a brief speech he delivers at a star-studded evening gala given in his honor. Some noted actors read aloud from his stories in the course of the celebration. One of the highlights of the evening was Meryl Streep's rendition of ""The Sign on Rosie's Door."" Streep shows why she is considered one of the premiere actors of our generation as she brilliantly brings to life this simple story about some playmates' attempt to put on a ""Show!""

There is also quite an array of trailers in a separately available section among the ""Extras"" on this disc. Viewed this way, these promos aren't irritating ads, but interesting vignettes in their own right. It seems that Oscilloscope, the production company for this Sendak film, specializes in backing films about people on the creative fringes, or simply on the fringes, of our society. You'll see trailers for such films as the one about some backwoods buddies who devote themselves to the search for ""Bigfoot,"" and the one about graffiti taggers.

So this DVD ends up being a full meal, with Sendak's interview just the appetizer.",1294358400,,2334,4.8104738154613464
4065702,5,B0033XKVE6,"I have only been able to watch this dvd once, and I want to pop it back in because I really enjoyed it the first time I watched it, but I wasn't able to focus my full attention on it because I wasn't sitting in front of the television, at the time.

However, for the most part, I was highly entertained by Maurice Sendak.  I absolutely loved learning about this awesomely creative author/artist that I grew up with. It was interesting to see the interaction between Spike, Catherine, and Maurice. It was almost as if it were three kids playing around and talking.

Sendak's outlook on life was very interesting, and it has seemed to work well for him since he's still alive...even though he didn't think he would still be alive at this age.

Overall, I loved the film! I got a chance to watch a few of the special features, and they are great, as well!",1276646400,,852,4.3734177215189876
4065703,5,B0033XKVE6,"A very good insight into the mind of Maurice Sendak who has been an enjoyable inspiration to children and adults.  If you are an illustrator, you will absolutely want to view this DVD.  Also, make sure you watch the additional information and the 80th birthday celebration.  I really enjoyed this DVD.",1270252800,2,301,4.862745098039215
4065704,5,B0033XKVE6,"We and our children have come of age with copies of the LITTLE BEAR books, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, IN THE NIGHT KITCHEN and dozens of other books by Maurice Sendak. Many are well-worn and few discarded. Sendak's books are unflinchingly honest, unconventional, beautiful and relentlessly original.

This brief, lovingly produced and edited documentary takes us into the heart of an author we thought we knew in a way that is human, frank, unflinching and funny. Sendak's vignettes give us with insight into the evolution of the artistic temperament and how a family constellation can inspire or frustrate genius.  We learn so much about the remarkable ties he shared with his brother and sister, his editors, mentors and detractors.

I was touched by the man's durable respect for the minds and hearts of children in a country which dumbs-down so many. I was surprised by his hysterical, often salty, sense-of-humor and inspiring resilience.  So, it is a testament to this film, and its uncommonly fine extras, that I ordered my first Sendak titles in 15 years this morning. My children are grown, but I am not.

Only the most callous viewer could resist the appeal of this film. Five stars.",1270252800,5,1193,4.91542288557214
4065705,5,B0033XKVE6,"I caught this on HBO On Demand last fall and wasn't really expecting much, but this is really a wonderful and moving film. It's short but sweet and it's one of the best documentaries I've seen in recent memory. Highly recommended.",1267747200,,230,4.634146341463414
4065706,5,B0033XKVE6,"I loved this film! Having read many of Sendak's books as a child it was wonderful to revisit the stories that filled my childhood and learn about their fascinating author and illustrator.  Jonze and Bangs create an intimate and moving portrait of a brilliant man. Sendak's own personal life is filled with rich stories and his sense of humor is infectious. I would recommend this doc, if you ever read one of Sendak's books you need to learn about this amazing artist.",1267574400,13,468,4.7073170731707314
4065707,5,B0033XKVE6,"This is such an intimate and beautifully structured documentary of Sendak. Jonze has created another quirky, irreverent and poetical portrait. It's short, yet plays at just the right length. Don't miss the bonus feature which play out just as dramatically as the featured work.",1266883200,5,277,5.318181818181818
8388108,5,B0033XKVE6,"I've been a fan of Maurice Sendak since I was a small child but I never knew much about him until the last few years. This short documentary meets Sendak in his Connecticut home, late in life, and explores his memories and ideas about life. I was very surprised that a lot of Sendak's brilliance, and his themes, seems to stem in some way from some trauma in his childhood. At eighty years old, Maurice Sendak was still working on figuring out what life was about and how to make meaning from one's experiences. This is a great exploration of one of the best creative minds of our time.",1498262400,,586,4.385321100917431
8388109,5,B0033XKVE6,Fantastic move! It is sad to see the way he thought towards the end of his life. A great purchase for a fan/collector of Mr. Sendak.,1493942400,,132,4.115384615384615
8388110,5,B0033XKVE6,"really great doc. ill watch it multiple times. he is a real person with real stories and deep feelings and reflections Ilove watching movies with odd people who make a way for themselves to exist and thrive and communicate.

8388112,5,B0033XKVE6,Learned about a man who wrote the book that I read to all my children. He told about his life and other books he has written. Very good documentary.,1470787200,,148,4.137931034482759
