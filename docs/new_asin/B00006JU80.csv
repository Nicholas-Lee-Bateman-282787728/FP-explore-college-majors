1782389,4,B00006JU80,"Okay, first a brief warning:  This is NOT Sailor Moon.  Despite the marketing on the first arc, and the subject matter, this series can get into some adult issues.  While it's all handled very tastefully, I would suggest that you not get this one for the kids because here is where it starts to show its real colors.
  It's been two years since the last volume was released, and in that time this series has developed quite a loyal following. ....  Still, the best is yet to come.  ...  It's wonderful, wacky, and deep all at the same time.  Unfortunately, I don't want to give any more of the plot away than they have, because there are already some minor spoilers for later (though nothing you couldn't have figured out on your own.)",1034121600,8,735,4.466165413533835
1782390,4,B00006JU80,"It is beyond comprehension that CPM is dragging its heals so much in its release of the complete Utena.  Of course, after the Black Rose there are still two entire story arcs to go, so don't get TOO excited.  But this'll do for now, I suppose.
These episodes introduce a number of new characters, the most important of these being Anthy's brother Akio, who may or may not be Utena's 'prince;' and the enigmatic Mikage, who is the force behind the duels that take place throughout.  Said episodes can at times feel a little formulaic--and it doesn't help that each duel ends with exactly the same choreography--but it's still exeptional, riveting stuff, with perhaps even more emotional cruelty that the first set (the episode that spotlights one of Namani's hangers-on, especially--augh).  Not to mention even less thinly-veiled incest subtexts.  It's not all dark, though; there's also 'Cowbell of Happiness,' the best comedy episode of anything ever.  Plus: the return of Saionji!  It's also necessary to note that the last few episodes are...confusing.  Not obnoxious-confusing, like the final episodes of Evangelion, but definitely not to be fully understood right away, and the real purpose of them--as well as the whole story arc--does not become clear until one had had a chance to see the rest of the show.
Like the first series, the Black Rose arc feels more like part of an extended introduction than anything else; though there are plenty of hints and veilled allusions here, the real 'story' doesn't kick into gear until after this series.  Which means it'll likely be years before it'll become available in the US.  Bummer.  Still, if you're not willing to ferret out the fansubs of the remainder, it'll have to do for the time being.",1031961600,3,1747,4.948630136986301

7970607,5,B00006JU80,"I'm a huge collector of anime. Revolutionary Girl Utena was a collection that I started in the early 2000s, but I couldn't find many of the discs once they started doing box sets. Finally came on here and was able to find them used, at a relatively cheap price--probably paid less for these discs than if I had gone out to buy a new disc or box set of it (starting at $29.99/disc, probably closer to a little over $100 for the boxset...). Very pleased with it since it runs like a charm and isn't too beaten up (doesn't skip, unlike some other discs I've gotten from sellers).",1361318400,,576,4.342592592592593

7970609,4,B00006JU80,"utena! utena! my luv!
how can you not fall in love with such a masqulin girl like utena? she kicks butt, is a great friend, and has... pink hair!
the black rose saga and so on is a bit on the wild side with it's twists and turns in the plot, but it's all there to keep the veiwers watching.
i was first turned off by the odd description from my best friend who- like me- luvs weird things. but out of curiosity i pluged it into my dvd player and coulden't turn it off! the next day, i had gone to the store and bought it.
it's not all oddness, but you have to definitely start at the begining to understand.curiosity is the key thing that made me see it in the 1st place, and i hope y'all like it too.",1062460800,,701,3.943661971830986

7970611,5,B00006JU80,"This DVD picks up speed on the Utena storyline and gives a better insight into the other characters besides Utena and Anthy. It also gets you ready for the Akio ""explosion"" you will expirience on the Akio Arc. This contains the 1st 4 episodes of the Black Rose Arc.
*episode 14- Utena battles Anthy's sister-in-law to be in oreder to stop from killing the rose bride. I give it 5 stars.
*15- Utena battles Miki's twin sister to protect the rose bride from her sword. His sister wants to kill the object of his affections.
*16- Complete filler and boredom. Nanami turns into a cow. I've gotten to where I skip this episode.
*17- Great epsisode. It introduces us to the Juri and Shiori love story. Shiori battles Utena because she now knows she is the object of Juri's affections. I give this 5 stars.
On a side note, the reviewer obviosly dosen't pay attention to the story line. Utena is not a trans, she says herself she's straight and her outfit looks girly anyway.",1055548800,4,967,4.531428571428571
7970612,4,B00006JU80,"On story, plot, etc, this dvd deserves a 5-star rating. I am a huge fan of UTENA and I was thrilled to see the release of this dvd, since it has been something like three years since the first storyline of the show was released to english-speaking audiences. It was worth the long wait. (and it is simply not true that all ""true fans"" will get fansubs long before the official release. some of us do wait, particularly for the higher quality and many options re dub/sub that a dvd release offers.)
However. The first two UTENA dvds, which cost the same as Black Rose Blooms, had 6 to 7 episodes per dvd. This dvd has only four episodes. It looks as though the next dvd, due in a few months, will have only three episodes. In my opinion, four episodes is the bare acceptable minimum for number of episodes on a [price] dvd. And even this dvd felt expensive, though Amazon's generous discount definitely helped defray the cost!
There are more than 20 episodes left for Central Park Media to release in the UTENA saga. Do the math: it's a trend I don't really like. They know this series is a fan favorite, and maybe they had to pay more for the rights to these later episodes - I know they had trouble getting them. I don't know if they're overpricing them or not. But I wish we were still getting 6 episodes per dvd.
Oh, what's this about? The usual: duelling, identity, betrayal, etc. These episodes are, for the most part, psychologically darker than earlier episodes, exploring the indefinably nasty undercurrent inherent in many of the relationships at Ohtori Academy. They introduce an important character: Akio Ohtori, Anthy's elder brother, the school's acting headmaster. Be prepared for a few shocking moments in each episode. Also be prepared for ""The Cowbell of Happiness"", this storyline's token Silly Nanami Episode, where Nanami wears a cowbell simply because she believes it's a designer showpiece, and slowly starts to take on many cowlike attributes.
Despite my discomfort with the reduced number of episodes on this dvd, it's really worth buying. UTENA is one of the most compelling shoujo anime series out there, and far less given to the plot-murkiness of certain other series. Fans won't want to miss this one, and people who aren't fans yet should check it out!",1038787200,8,2282,4.736180904522613
7970613,2,B00006JU80,"It's like someone playing a song off key and much to fast, you recognize the song they're playing but the feeling's just not there. It leaves you kind of wanting...
I'd enthusiastically recommend the first 2 volumes, to me they are a rare masterpiece. This third volume I do not think I would recommend. This is not to say that you should or should not watch it, I really can't say much on that subject.",1038268800,,403,4.386666666666667
7970614,5,B00006JU80,"Charles Solomon's review (the one under the product) for this edition of Utena is insulting to the people who would buy this item and I think you should take it off and replace it with another ""Editorial review"" because he clearly has no true appreciation of Utena and will not inspire *anyone* to buy it with his tactless, misinformed ideas about it. True Utena lovers will discard his review as nonsensical and a great heaping load of BS from an outsider who we should pity because he will never fully understand the compelling, scintillating and undeniable genius of Chiho Saito's Shoujo Kakumei Utena. I doubt he even watched this anime all the way through. He probably watched this edition only and didn't even bother with the other tapes in which case he is not qualified to write a proper review. Otaku's and anime enthusiasts pay no heed to his misinformed review. This next Utena is just as amazing as the rest and you MUST see the rest in order to fully appreciate this. As for the EDITORIAL REVIEW - SHOUJO means it's targeted for girls... young girls... How the heck would that 'guy' know what we think about this (Masterpiece of an) anime or what we feel about it?... because it's not Shakespeare doesn't mean it isn't a rich tapestry of emotions and drama. Hmph. Kiss my Revolution!
Girls 13 and up - this anime is great but true it is not for everyone as I'm sure many other reviewers as have mentioned...
The characters are complex, the story is NOTHING like the movie, the graphic novels are awesome, but watch Utena in sequence if you want to get the most enjoyment out of it. The 'hokiness' of it is the best part about Utena. When Touga and Miki and Juri go onto the elevator and start to recite their end of the world theme it brings a smile to my face everytime I get on an elavator cause I just wanna recite his ""We are the chick!"" speech. Utena is not as bad as Sailor Moon. She's not ditzy, loud or obnoxious. She's actually a likeable and a STRONG female character.... obviously this editorial reviewer just couldn't handle the idea of a strong woman.",1037232000,19,2077,4.541333333333333
7970615,4,B00006JU80,"Okay look. Its painfully appearant that Mr. Charles has not seen a lick of good anime in his life and hence failed to recognize one staring him straight in the face. This series *is* in fact more than silly teenage girls 'elevating their crushes to world catastrophe' or whatever he said. In fact the entire underlying meaning of the series is about that...revolutionizing the world and helping oneself and others to break free of what holds them back. One has to see behind what the chracters are saying to what the truth of the story is. And there is in fact *very* good reason that Utena dresses in the boys school uniform and why Mamiya 'tries to be a Rose Bride...' (<snickers> He reallly missed the point of that one). Bascially, my recommendation is this: if you haven't seen the first 13 episodes then you will be utterly lost (where as those who have would only be nearly completely lost hehe) and you *will* hate it much as he did.
However if you like the first episodes then this starts in a new round of duelists. Now I must admit that the Black Rose season is the cheesiest season of them all. As a matter of fact the only ones worth much are the Nanami cow episode (for comic relief) and the Wakaba duel episode (yes, Utena must face her best friend!) Many of the episodes are very repetative in this season, but some of the episodes are key to what happens later in the Akio Car and Revolution Arcs...so if all else fails at least do yourself the favor and watch the fansubs of this season if you can and save the money for the last 2 sets. ^^;;",1037059200,3,1560,4.382758620689655
