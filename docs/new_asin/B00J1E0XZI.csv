Hopefully, Amazon will give me another copy with subtitles so I can more accurately evaluate this movie.",1470700800,,275,5.133333333333334

8647259,3,B00J1E0XZI,"I am not very critical of movies and i love Mexican films. Having that said I expected a lot of this movie. The movie is about 2 couples, a single ex soccer player and a matured single woman. One of the couples have problems conceiving. The other couple is a gay guy and a aspiring singer and are married just to cover his homosexuality from his family. The single ex soccer player is so depress because his career is over due to an injury and his girlfriend doesn't want to move in together. He ends up sleeping with the gay guy then he does not want to acknowledge his gay encounter. And so on drama. The movie is billed as a romantic comedy, but the was no lol moments and no romance that I can remember. Now the movie does portrait typical social problems so I guess that deserve 3 stars.",1400630400,2,792,4.251655629139073
