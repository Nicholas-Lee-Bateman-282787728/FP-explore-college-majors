5396429,3,B00A7ZRZ7E,"Inspirational movie, great story, amazing runners.  Men would especially love this movie.

However, a major flaw of this documentary is that the only women portrayed in the film are the supportive girlfriends of the male elite runners.  Where are the women ultramarathoners?  I know they were there!  This disappointment made it extremely difficult for me to relate to the movie on a personal level.",1371168000,13,399,5.171875

5396432,4,B00A7ZRZ7E,"Fun to get to know the runners on a personal level...and there were great shots of different locations and terrain that the runners have trained on and raced on.

I am looking forward to seeing a similar documentary about the women runners.  That was the only disappointing aspect of watchinig the video: wishing they had showcased the other gender.",1369440000,5,349,4.898305084745763

The movie is well put together and tells a beautiful story of an exciting Western States.  My husband loved it, and so did I.

5396500,5,B00A7ZRZ7E,"For those that don't know, The Western States 100 is the primo 100-mile trail race in the world.  It has been in existence for decades; and continues to draw world-class fields.  For the year of publication, the producers put together a great story and documentary of 4 world class ultra-distance trail runners - 3 Americans and 1 Spaniard.  The ""big 4"" had all won multiple 100 mile (and farther) trail races through extreme conditions.  Roes had been virtually undefeated in a half-dozen 100 milers; with a notable 100-miler victory (by over 3 hours) in Alaska's frigid temps.  Krupicka won the Leadville 100 - all above 9200' and peaking (twice) at 12,600'.  Koerner had a decade of ultra races behind him - and a WS 100 victory.  Jornet had won the prestigious UTMB in Europe - and many of his exploits weren't even races!

All 4 are followed to their respective homes in Alaska (Roes lived there in modest circumstances - near Juneau), Colorado (Krupicka lives at the base of the mountains), Oregon (Koerner owns a running store there), and Spain (where Jornet skis, runs, and never seems to sit down) - with their histories, families, girl friends, and aspirations - all with a lead-in to an epic race",1446249600,2,1207,4.769230769230769

5396555,5,B00A7ZRZ7E,"""Thirty bucks for a non-BluRay?"" I first thought.

Five seconds into the movie, I was hooked.

The movie cleverly builds up to the finish, with descriptions of the sport, the course, and well-filmed biographies of the four featured runners.

And what four runners they were. You do not ""root against"" any of the four. There are likable personalities amongst all four, and peculiarities in each.

After watching, I was relieved that I didn't have to return it to the rental store.

Enjoyable for any trail-runner or marathoner. Ironman finishers would probably dislike it, as it makes clear that there are bigger badasses than them.",1434499200,3,631,5.028846153846154

Wow! Unbreakable was well filmed, edited and put together. We really enjoyed seeing the background and daily lives of some of the runners, appreciated how well they were tied in with where each runner was on the course and thought they did an excellent job of following each racer featured while keeping it clear where each one was during the race. Anyone involved in running, sports/fitness and endurance races of any kind will appreciate the work that went into making this film.

5396640,5,B00A7ZRZ7E,I love this movie if for no other reason than it made me care about the characters in it. However there are many other reasons to love it. The photography shows breath taking views of the race from start to finish. The camera does not get in the way of the story that is unfolding. This is amazing event to start with and being able to capture much of the essence of the race must have been a unique undertaking and it makes a first class viewing experience. Along with Spirit of the Marathon I this is my favorite running movie.,1411171200,,529,4.247524752475248

5396718,3,B00A7ZRZ7E,"The documentary follows the four main contenders for the 2010 Western States 100 run. This is a foot race of 100 miles duration over some very tough terrain. The challenges met in running a race of this duration were described very well in Dean Karnazes book ""Ultramarathon Man"". I was hoping that the film would capture some of this and I believe it does capture ""some"" of it. An event of this duration (about 15 hours for the winner) is probably not that easy to translate into film. Some of the footage and interviews with the runners are great. Particularly the footage of the Spanish runner Killian Jornet is impressive. My main gripe is there does seem to be a considerable amount of filler footage both in the lead up to the race start and interspersed between the race footage. So you see what seems like hours of footage of competitors talking to their girlfriends and cooking dinner. This isn't particularly interesting. I'd like some more probing interviews about their training, diet and the mental demands of enduring an extreme event like this. There was some of this but the balance between this and ""filler"" material wasn't great. As a runner I am interested in these sorts of films and therefore don't regret watching it. I think runners and those who enjoy documentaries about extreme endurance sports should see the film. But I think it could have been quite a lot better in terms of interview depth and editing out the filler material.",1404950400,4,1455,4.75494071146245

5396722,5,B00A7ZRZ7E,"Being a back-of-the pack ultra-runner, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how things go for the ""ultra-gods"" at the front of the race!  A very interesting look at four runners all entering this ultra ""Major"" undefeated and following the race to see who would remain so.

I watched this two days before a fifty miler for added inspiration and highly recommend it for any distance runner's collection!",1401408000,,392,5.015384615384615
5396723,4,B00A7ZRZ7E,"as a trail runner, i have a tendency to gravitate towards these types of documentaries. as someone who tends be be thrifty coupled with the fact that i couldn't find this guy anywhere, i bought this guy on blind faith. i'm fairly happy with my purchase. the movie is different from the other couple of ultra-running movies i've seen in the past in that there is much more emphasis on the four main stars of the movie. the doc goes into great detail showing each runner's background, talking with each of their wives/girlfriends,  etc. there is, however, a large chunk towards the end of the movie (maybe last 20 minutes or so) that provides some great trail running footage. if you've seen the MMT 100 movie, it is nothing like that. these are elite runners and they cannot afford the time to talk to the camera during the race. overall, it's good if you like this type of stuff.",1395187200,,879,4.528301886792453
5396724,5,B00A7ZRZ7E,"Inspiring stories, and great scenery.  The camera is a bit shaky at times, but I guess that shows that the filmmakers were legitimately involved in the action.

Qualified October of 2010, ran Boston April 2011, and became a trail runner as soon as I got of the plane from Boston.  I ran my first 100 miler in Sept of 2011 and have done 4 more since then including Wasatch once and Bear twice.  My trail running goal was to run Western States someday and after 3 years of putting my name in I got picked for the 2014 race.  I have watched this movie a bunch of times to get excited and feel the energy only a 100 mile race can provide.  I would recommend this to any runner who wants to be inspired by what is possible!",1394755200,9,638,4.031746031746032
5396746,4,B00A7ZRZ7E,"The characters in this documentary are outstanding humans! And they're taking part in one of the toughest trail races in the United States. It was great to meet them personally and hear what people close to them had to say about their lives and their spirits. Unbreakable is at its best in the close moments with the runners and their loved ones during their daily lives. The ""grander"" shots didn't have the quality I wanted to see especially when shooting is such an amazing locale. Props for the mid-race coverage, as I know how difficult it can be to stabilize a camera on the runbut both the mid-race coverage and the scene-setting shots could have been much higher quality. JB Benna is a great storyteller and an amazing advocate for the sport!",1394409600,,749,4.681818181818182

5396749,4,B00A7ZRZ7E,"I ran my first ultra in hopes of qualifying for the Western States. Though I fell short I haven't given up. I bought this film because I want as much information on the Sates course as possible for when I get to run it. I also wanted some winter inspiration and to learn more about the runners in the film. The film delivered all three. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it made me want to go and run. I have an interest in film and would have given it 5 stars if the production quality (in the race part) had been a little better. It is a movie about running so has a limited audience and I have since learnt about how last minute it was shot (the race part) so the smaller production budget and delivery is understandable. If they made another film about another ultra I would buy it.
