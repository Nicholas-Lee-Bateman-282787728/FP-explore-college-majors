2355109,1,B000A3456M,This dvd is only 48 min. long-and repeats the SAME program when it is done-special feature interviews added don't even add up to the 120 minutes it claims on the box-for in the know students of ufology-it offers no new info-,1282089600,14,224,4.487804878048781
2355110,5,B000A3456M,"I HAVE FOLLOWED THE  UFO SUBJECT FOR OVER  50 YEAR.  I RECOMMEND THIS DVD,  UFOS; 50 YEARS OF DENIAL.  THE AUDIO AND VIDEO ARE EXCELLENT.
ANSWERS QUESTION OF HOW AND WHY THE COVER-UP  CONTINUES.  IT IS NO LONGER COVERED UP.  THE INFORMATION IS REVEALED, WE JUST DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY HARDWARE.",1261526400,28,297,4.471698113207547
2355111,5,B000A3456M,"There are plenty of UFO documentaries, but this one tells it straight, in good chronological order, gets to the issues, and as such is an indispensible introduction to the subject.  The testimonies of Jesse Marcel and Philip J. Corso are especially compelling because they were military brass who kept their secrecy oaths until near the end of their lives. Former Astronaut and moonwalker Edgar Mitchell is convinced extraterrestrial intelligences are visiting our planetary system.

This documentary is a well needed corrective to the debunking propoganda of mainstream media (the Peter Jennings ABC special, for example) that passes for ""objective"" analysis. Perhaps if PBS or ABC aired this documentary in prime time people might begin to wonder. But that is never going to happen.",1218585600,50,784,5.365853658536586
2355112,4,B000A3456M,"Decent production with interviews from leading UFO researchers plus some of the last footage of the late Col. Corso, author of:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Roswell/dp/B00006G9QN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Roswell</a>.",1204934400,23,292,9.851851851851851
2355133,4,B000A3456M,Why does the audio drop out at about 26 minutes? That's almost clique'.....,1427155200,2,75,4.846153846153846
2355134,1,B000A3456M,Interesting but lost sound about 26 minutes into the video and never got it back.,1426896000,2,81,4.466666666666667
2355135,2,B000A3456M,not very good for the money. watch the same thing free on utube.,1419811200,,64,4.0
2355136,5,B000A3456M,"Confession: I am a ""Paranormal Studies"" junkie... or, umm... Major. That is why I rate this DVD so high.

If you are a committed UFO debunker or a ""Capital--'S'--Skeptic"" then this DVD will provide further ammunition for you to prove how easily deluded and irresponsible even intelligent, well-educated and highly qualified professionals can be.

If you are thoughtful, intelligent, inquisitive and deliberate (in other words, a true sceptic in the classical sense) this DVD will impress you with the courage and commitment shown by a few intelligent, well-educated and highly qualified professionals.",1416009600,2,601,5.521739130434782
2355137,3,B000A3456M,it was ok i had seen most of it on other shows nothing really new,1408924800,,65,3.4
2355138,4,B000A3456M,Well made and it plays well and there is lots of info brought together in one spot which is useful,1391299200,,98,3.95
2355139,4,B000A3456M,It was very good but only goes for about 50 mins not 2 hours but it had 2 interviews from an astronaut who's been to the moon and Phillip j corso if you've read his book the day after Roswell you'd know that he's an extremely intelligent and reliable source the best I know of. It's a well done and informative doco giving you a run down of how things are and how the government treats ufo crafts etc. I recommend it for those who are interested and those who are unaware of how it all works.,1389916800,3,492,4.082474226804123
2355140,5,B000A3456M,Son like it. Product came in good shape. Fun for my son. He enjoyed it. Good stuff. Thanks for sending.,1358121600,,103,4.2
2355141,5,B000A3456M,"I own probably 10 UFO dvd's - - and this one, by far, is the best of all of them !  The interview with Colonel Philip Corso in the ""special bonus material"" section was truly superb.  GREAT research went into this marvelous movie.  This DVD won two EBE awards.  From Area 51, to Roswell, to Gerald Ford's memoirs to the never-ending governmental cover-ups, this DVD will hold your interest for the entire 2-hours !  A MUST PURCHASE !!",1336262400,13,433,4.5
2355142,3,B000A3456M,"Purchased this for my brother who truely believes in UFO's. I watched it before spending it to him and thought it was kind of boring to be honest, however there were a few things that caught my attention.",1293408000,,204,4.394736842105263
