1976449,1,B00018HU5Y,"This review is for the region 2 UK, Anchor Bay version of the DVD, ""Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun"".  I'm mentioning what version I'm reviewing because it looks like Amazon has copied viewer reviews from a different release of this film.  I'll elaborate on that a bit more further down.  I am not reviewing the movie itself, as I feel the other reviewers have given a good summary from both positive and negative angles already.

In this region 2 UK version of the film, all content with nudity involving Susan Hemingway has been removed.  Curiously, all nudity involving the other characters is still intact.  I can only speculate as to why.  I thought there was something odd with this release when I watched the film and reread the comments from the other reviewers here.  I did some digging and found this same version is for sale on Amazon UK.  Many reviewers there confirmed what I thought.  In addition, other sources indicate this movie should be several minutes longer than what is offered here.

So, I give this release of the DVD one star.  I do this not just because it has been cut, but also due to there being no mention of this on the DVD case.  In fact, it says ""The Official Jess Franco Collection"" on the top.  I would have thought an ""official"" version would be a complete, uncut version, but that is NOT what is being sold here.  Caveat Emptor...

Ironically, the reviewers on Amazon UK say there is a region 1 US version available here (on Amazon US) which is completely intact.  Apparently, that is no longer available, since searches here on Amazon US only return this UK version...which brings me to the subject of the other reviews here (US).  These have obviously been written when the region 1 version was available, so Amazon decided to simply copy those reviews to this region 2 UK version.  I find this misleading - I wish Amazon would make it clear these reviews were for a different product than the one they are actually featuring for sale - even if it is only available from third party sellers.

One of the reviewers on Amazon UK declared this a ""rubbish release"".  I couldn't agree more.  Don't buy this version unless you don't mind several minutes being cut.  Not only does this remove all of the nudity involving the main character, it makes several of those scenes very confusing.  Instead, look for a complete version such as the German Blu-Ray release by Ascot Elite, which is currently available from Amazon UK (from a third party seller).",1444694400,11,2484,4.644495412844036
1976450,1,B00018HU5Y,"This Franco convent film (by ""Jesus"" Franco I note, heh heh) starts off like a wip flick, as 11 minutes in we get a sort of combined ""entry scene"" and ""examination scene"" with the young heroine getting her skirts lifted by a nun who could stand in for the wip evil prison guard. Unfortunately the camera doesn't take the invitation to take a peek, and we have to wait for the 20 minute mark before we get to what could be an ""inmate"" lez scene with the fresh fish.

But then the wip prison form falls apart, as instead of making out, the (very young and very cute) initiate gets fitted with ""crown of thorns"" underwear, which could be pretty cool if Franco would have followed through, but no, we just get a string of extremely fakey makeup blood and the scene ends. Bummer. But that's Franco all over. He films something of fine quality and blows it by screwing up the abuse effects, it's almost always that way, a couple exceptions aside.

Then there's some weird scene involving some kind of bowl placed between another (older) nun's legs, which the satan-worshipping nuns are kissing, but I have no idea why or what is going on, maybe if I had the sound up it would help, and if the version I saw wasn't in German of course. Anyway, we do get some really furry implied nun munching going on, but very much R rated, before she's all covered in fake blood for some reason, being pawed by hands with fake hair glued to them. Geez, the plot thickens, as does the spirit gum, readily visible on the fingers.

Oh, Jess.

Meanwhile we're back to the young one in bed wearing her stylish undergarments still, judging by the blood on her robe, and the same fake blood dripping scene is repeated (he must have run out after the previous scene). Then there's some dream-state implied non-nun munching, before the hairy hands are back and we get some carpet rubbing, with less nap. By the way, slow it way down at this point, shot by shot, and you'll get treated to the girl apparently milking a cow, and missing the bucket. Pretty interesting little side trip to the barn there. Splat.

Someone must have gone out for more fake blood, because all of a sudden we're in a dungeon with a couple of the nuns getting the squeeze put on them. Interesting, I didn't know hair could bleed. Anyway, oops, it was a dream, oh well. Or maybe not, because possibly these same nuns end up hanging around a dungeon later on, liberally swathed in fake blood of course. We never find out what's going on with them. A little R nun lez follows, nothing the horsing around on Night Calls couldn't trumph, and then a totally wasted priest rape scene involving our little cutey with zip nudity at all. Double bummer.

Then, wowzers, it's church orgy time, complete with the spirit gum hands guy back again leering mightily, and brief snippets of nun lez activity, some pretty cute and some rather matronly, including some more shag carpet, but again, all very mild. I'm not sure what was going on there.

Finally, after some escape type plot, we get the young one chained to the wall to be punished, for escaping I think, and the interest level goes way up, because she's really cute. But no, it's Franco of course, and what could be a really outstanding hot iron scene is completely ruined with fake blood and even what appears to be an attempt to simulate heat by using red paint! Oh man, he should be whipped himself for screwing that one up. And not with a trademark Franco bathrobe belt either.

Some more plot, and our cutey is nude and in the inquisition dungeon (I think, judging by the new guys with robes that show up). Redemption for Jess? No, just more of the fresh fake blood supply used up, some of which appears to have been applied like finger paint. Cutey gets stretched, and warmed up some (off camera), confesses, and they let her off for the meantime. Then she tosses a note out of a window, Swamp Castle style. Someday this will all be yours! What, the fake blood? Oh, uh, sorry, I think was curtains in the Python flick. Anyway, Sir Lancelot reads the note and saves cutey from being burned at the last minute, which is a shame, it would have been great fun watching Jess, er, I mean Jesus, messing that up.

Well, what can you say? Just given the scenes that occurred, this could have been a five star sleaze winner, even without the obligatrory convent nun bathing and flagellation scenes. But all that potential is just totally flushed by the master of sleaze disaster. Pitiful, three sleaze stars for the cutey, the implied abuse and the nudity, but two deducted for unholy quantities of fake blood and tragically missed opportunities.",1152316800,9,4632,4.5311004784688995

8007832,4,B00018HU5Y,"This film was originally released in Germany to as Die Liebesbriefe einer portugiesischen Nonne and as Cartas de amor a una monja portugesa in Spain (1977). As some of you might guess, this film was another collaboration between Spanish director Jess Franco and German producer Erwin Dietrich. I tend to split Fanco films into typically bad (bad acting, non sense transition between scenes, too gratuitous sex situations, bad scenery and lighting) and good. While the ""good"" category of films is a rather limited pool, this film fits that category. Here we have a drama, with a relatively original story, with good acting by the main characters, a nice natural setting (shot in an abbey in Portugal), and nice customs. To that you add bits of exploitation, and lots of sexuality (simulated or softcore). Yet, you don't have the typical ""all women walking around naked element here.

In the plot, teen aged Maria (played by Susan Hemingway) is forced into Serra D'Aires convent, secretly run by Satanists led by Father Vicente (William Berger) in collusion with the Mother Superior (Ana Zanatti). Maria is tortured, forced into sex with father Vicente, and with a horned Devil. Eventually, she falls into the hands of the Inquisition, and condemned to death. So, this one should be labelled into the nun exploitation category of films, yet this is a good one.

Technically, this is standard NTSC, region free release by Full Moon Features. The image is mostly crisp clear, and presented in a widescreen format. My guess is that this current release took advantage of the previous Franco film release program by VIP (Jess Franco Golden Goya Collection). Very importantly, the film is the uncut version, running for about 89 minutes. The movie comes in English with no subtitles. Extras include interviews with Jess Franco, his late muse Lina Romay, and producer Erwin Dietrich. So, a good deal for the money for Franco fans.",1485820800,6,1922,5.021943573667712
