8015539,4,B0001OGVQW,"....but enjoyable nonetheless.  This series preceeded some of the other gundam series and the similarity of certain characters is undeniable.  Still, its an interesting look at how total universal war affects all - from young children to the elderly.  Teenagers, of course, become willing and unwilling draftees into the fighting.  This seems to be the basis of war in anime - that teenagers constitute a good portion of the armed forces. They wear the mobile suits and operate them - and perhaps it is an accurate representation in that younger people are able to grasp technology a lot faster than the generation before them.
Of course, these kids have to grow up too fast in this situation - they lose loved ones, new and old friends....all the while creating for themselves new families and friends.  The fashions and hair are definitely ""seventies"" - and the look of the anime is ""older"" also - but still, a satisfying predecessor to gundam seed destiny.",1198368000,,959,4.895061728395062
