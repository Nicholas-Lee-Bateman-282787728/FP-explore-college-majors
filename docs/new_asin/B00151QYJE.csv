3136870,4,B00151QYJE,"From days of long ago.  From uncharted regions of the universe....you know the rest.  Or do you?....

In this day and age, it's nice to go down memory lane.  DVDs has paved the way to relive moments through lots of restoration and remastering.  We're also in an age where certain shows and movies are being released unrated, uncut and uncensored.  Beast King Golion is one of those examples.

Golion, originally released in the early 1980's, wasn't one of Japan's most popular shows, but it proved to be a smash hit in the United States and internationally when it was redubbed and edited to create the universe of Voltron-Defender of the Universe.  Created by the legendary and world-famous Toei Animation Co., the entire mythos of Golion's rise and fall of power is explained a whole lot better in Golion than Voltron.

Some questions are definitely answered with this release:
(1) Do people evacuate safely?  Sometimes yes, but mostly no.
(2) Did a certain character heal from his or her wounds?  No.

As with some or most anime, graphic violence, senseless murders (to include decapitations), suicides, cannibalism, human treatment (whipping of slaves), religious references and moderate to strong profanity are commonplace.  It has its funny moments, especially when the main cast started to argue, laugh and scream in Japanese.  The opening and ending theme cues are somewhat catchy.  Unlike some animation here in the U.S., a Japanese voice-over narration helps to round it out.  When it comes to the forthcoming episode, the narrator sometimes gives the plot away and kills the anticipation and excitement.

Like the previous reviewer said, the only special feature are preview trailers of other forthcoming anime DVDs.  If you're looking for special features, they're better with the Voltron box sets.

Hats off to World Events Productions, Toei Animation Co., Anime Works and Media Blasters for finally releasing one of Japan's most underrated anime gems out of the halls of mystery and into the DVD spotlight.  If you're a Voltron fan, and if you remember some or all of the episodes, it'll make you look at Voltron in a different light after watching this.  Nothing against World Events, and kudos for editing and fitting it for the American and international markets, but the real story is more interesting and detailed in Golion.

In conclusion, if you're a true Voltron fan, don't put off Voltron because of its true origins within Golion.  Many people criticize this because like many anime that were localized and played here in the U.S., companies had to follow stricter standards and guidelines from government corporations like the FCC for viewing on American television, especially to a kids audience, which is why the story was the way it was here in America.  Having said that, Voltron's (and even Beast King Golion's) fate is forever sealed as one of the many pop culture cornerstones of the 20th century.",1213574400,18,2929,5.041580041580041
3136871,3,B00151QYJE,"Golion (1981) is the Japanese TV show that Voltron was made from. As you'll hear from the opening music, Golion is definitely a kids show. However, Japanese kids get way more leeway in what they can watch!

The first episode is vastly different than what appears in Voltron. The Earth is destroyed by nuclear war. They show men, wemon and children being burned alive. The Galra empire forces healthy slaves to eat the dead slaves. There were also many decapitations that didn't make it into Voltron. If I had kids, they would not be allowed to see this show.

After the first episode, the show doesn't differ much from the Voltron we know (aside from the constant peppering of decapitation and canibalism). After the princess pilots the blue lion in episode seven, the show becomes a series of short, disjointed episodes featuring simple characters.

There also aren't many DVD features. There's only Japanese audio, and you can turn the subtitles on and off. There are previews of other shows on the third disk, including a long preview of Vehicle Voltron. There is no commentary, behind the scenes, or liner notes.

Still, I liked watching it. The opening and ending songs are so campy they made me laugh. The episodes seem more silly than anything else. Also, you get 18 episodes with the set, so it will keep you occupied for some time. Campy fun, but not much else.",1213401600,,1370,4.743697478991597

8256962,5,B00151QYJE,"As I have said in my reviews for ""Armored Fleet Dairugger XV"" I am very pleased Media Blasters issued this Japanimated series on DVD so all of us ""Voltron"" fans can see where the show we enjoyed so much as kids came from.

""King of Beasts GoLion"" is an excellent series that delivers great entertainment and non-stop thrills.  What helps to make this series great is its realistic portrayal of war.  There is a great deal of death and destruction on both sides.  In some cases we see that even victories can come at a great cost.  This is something we never see in ""Voltron"" which I think, though I understand that series was targeted to children, is a liability because it comes across as unrealistic.

The series is set in the year 1999.  Five space explorers return to Earth from a deep space mission only to find unspeakable tragedy awaits them.  Earth has been decimated by Thermonuclear War.  All of civilization has been laid waste and humanity has been wiped out.  The explorers are soon captured by Commander Sadak (Yurak in ""Voltron"".) of the evil Galra Empire and brought to the Great Dark Nebula (Planet Doom in ""Voltron"".).  There the brutal Emperor Diabazaal (King Zarkon in ""Voltron"".) and the witch Honerva (Haggar in ""Voltron"".) force slaves rounded up from all over the galaxy to participate in bloody gladiator like competitons with what are called Deathblack Beastmen (Robeasts in ""Voltron"".).  The explorers, not wanting to be butchered in the gladiator arena, escape by stealing a slave ship and heading off into space.  The pursuing Commander Sadak shoots the ship down making it crash land on the Planet Altea (Arus in ""Voltron"".) which fifteen years prior was conqured and decimated by the Galra Imperial Forces and it's ruling family executed.  The explorers make their way to the ruins of an old castle where they meet Princess Fala (Alura in ""Voltron"".), the last survivng member of Altea's Royal Family and her strategist Raible (Coran in ""Voltron"".).

One major difference here is there is no Galaxy Garrison in this series.  That aspect of ""Voltron"" was taken directly out of ""Armored Fleet Dairugger XV"" which was the totally separate and unrelated series used to create Vehicle Voltron.  Other differences include realistic portrayls of death and war as mentioned earlier.

The eighteen episodes featured on this DVD collection are a great way to start this terrific series.  Even if you are not a fan of ""Voltron"" I highly recommend this great series.  You will not be dissappointed.",1336953600,,2517,4.919431279620853
8256963,4,B00151QYJE,"I give this only four because, I felt some of it didn't hold up. That and I felt if they were willing to go so far on some of the more violent parts. They really should have gone all out on the rest.  Sincler is clearly violent, passionate, and insane. More details of his past. Would have developed him, givng us reasons for his insanity. Other than his crule father and later as we find out. Angry and traitorous grandmother. Thats right kids. The old witch is his gramma.  While I understand they wanted to keep some surpires. It would have been nice to get some flashback or early backstory on him. Maybe cut to him out on his campain, while daddy's talking about him. Something other than he's the imperal prince.  Thus evil murdering nutcase.  There was a lot of good things about this.  What with the showing of the missing sences, exct.  Its got a lot of action, murder, despration, and insanity going on. People are killed left and right and it doesn't matter if your good or evil.  This show does its best to drive home the point, that war is war. And it does take much for anyone to die in this show.  Go Lion clearly not for small kids.  However this is still a really good anime.  After they get a few eps in, the show really started to take off. It started to become more engaging and draw you in more.  I would tell any fan of Voltron now grown.  To pick this up for say 15 dollars.  Its a very good show. I just won't spend a lot on this. Like I said its very good.  Just don't spend a lot.  It's missing some plots points, and there's some plot bunnies in it too.  This in some ways is the fore runner to the giant mecha animes of today.",1261699200,,1654,4.186708860759493
8256964,4,B00151QYJE,"Beast King Golion is a great DVD set to own, especially for people who grew up in the 80's watching Voltron. It is so different from what was shown in the U.S., it's the same and familar but totally different and unique. Watch it and that will make sense. The only problem I had was that I wish it included an english audio track and not just subtitles. Also, this is not for kids. There is a LOT of swearing and a LOT of graphic violence,so viewer discretion is really advised. It's an another side of a childhood hero that I enjoyed and look forward to picking up Vol. 2 and 3.",1250208000,,579,4.178571428571429
8256965,3,B00151QYJE,"Having seen Voltron when I was very young, I enjoyed watching the show that Voltron came from.  The series is very different from the one I grew up with: more violent, graphic, tragic, but humorous as well.  The story is follows a logical plot, and I wonder how they managed to get away with so many changes with the Voltron series (I suppose as a kid I wouldn't notice the difference).  One thing I didn't like was the music and sound effects during the gattai/combine sequences, they seemed a little weak.  I actually feel the American Voltron series was better in that regard, but that is all.  Otherwise the music is great, they even have theme songs for the different Lions (which I found very amusing).  Although the repeatative ""Sentai/Power Ranger"" nature of the show (5-man team with robots that combine into a giant robot to beat a giant monster) can be a little boring, if you are a fan of Voltron you should check out Go Lion.",1224460800,,938,4.553571428571429
8256966,3,B00151QYJE,"This is a three-disc set that contains the first eighteen episodes of the series.  All of the episodes only have Japanese audio, and you choose whether or not to have subtitles.

My biggest disappointment with this DVD set is the audio levels.  The volume level on all three of the discs is rather soft, so you have to turn up the volume quite a bit in order to listen.

For me, the best part of watching this box set is to see how the episodes were re-cut and edited for Voltron.  In the long run, I felt that from the episodes I saw on this DVD, that GoLion was ultimately stronger than its Voltron counterpart.  One of the biggest improvements is the fact that the timeline for the events leading up to the start of the series is much clearer in GoLion than it is in its Voltron counterpart.  I also enjoyed the GoLion theme song immensely.

In this DVD set, you see the space explorers bring GoLion back, the death of Shirogane (aka Sven), the death of Sadak (aka Yurak), and the arrival of Ms. Hys (aka Nanny) and Prince Sincline (aka Prince Lotor).

While Voltron would be acceptable for kids to watch, I can't say the same thing for Beast King GoLion.  This set is definitely being targeted at and marketed to the adults who had originally watched Voltron when they were children over twenty years ago.

Even with the issues I had with the audio, I would definitely recommend this set to any Voltron fan who is curious to see what the series was originally like before it became Lion Force Voltron.  However, if you do purchase this set, be sure to watch it when younger children aren't around or after they've gone to bed.",1222819200,,1630,4.432885906040268
8256967,5,B00151QYJE,"Golion is a great anime series! Golion Japanese anime series is what came from Voltron. In Japan, the robot known as Voltron is called Golion. the anime series is great because this version is more like real anime because the Japanese animation is really good! The music is more Japanese and feels more like 1970s music! I highly recommend this Golion dvd set! My only complaint is the anime violence is not suitable for children. Parents: do not let your kids watch Golion! Golion is NOT for little children. This anime is for mature adults. I Highly recommed it!  Get this dvd!  Because the Golion anime is very rare and hard to find here in North America. A+",1221782400,,661,4.593220338983051
8256968,4,B00151QYJE,"The cartoon I grew up on improved with all of the cutting room floor goodies added back in.

The names are all different, it's more graphic, and now you have to read subtitles, but it's so much fun..the camp value here is off the charts.

Throw in some Japanese cheese, mixed with some 70's disco funk and some 80's synth and you've got yourself a classic anime, with a FUN soundtrack/score.

Basically an unedited flashback from a Japanese perspective.

8256969,3,B00151QYJE,"King Beast Go Lion 1 is a collection of 18 episodes in their original japanese, uncut for the older anime fan.  Though this show was translated into Voltron, defender of the middle galaxy, you get a tiny bit more of the story here with Golion.  Without going through a boat load of spoilers and storyline differences, the feel of the two shows are the same and different at the same time.

With GoLion, it was obvious that toy makers wanted to market giant combination robots toys that had swords and interchangable pieces.  Some of the screen shots showing the recycled footage of the robot combining can be so campy, you can almost physically see yourself snapping together and holding golion while you blast the deathblack beastman to smitereens.

Aside from the standard recycled footage, the decapitations, cannibalism, and ultra violence that anime is known for, there is something else.  It was refreshing to see a super sentai series that actually allow the characters to morn and pray.  Most other super sentai series (like power rangers) just fight one bad guy after another, while innocent people get hurt and feel no remorse for the damage was done.  The praying, and the grave visits was left out of the US cut Voltron...and I do not know why.  (At least robotech showed mourning and death..)

This show is also entertaining that the show makes fun of itself at time (none of the characters are called by their actual names, just chief-red, quiet (the black one), moody - blue, hot head- yellow and chibi (tiny) - green....and there was the princess (the girl).  A lot of disney references (long lost aunts, a witch, talking mice...etc) was thrown in the mix, Go Lion is a nice ride back in time.

Shouts out to Mediablaster for going back in time and getting us those great old 80's animes...if only someone can bring out the japanese season of Transformers!!!

I am looking forward to the rest of the series:>",1214006400,11,1924,4.759036144578313
8256970,5,B00151QYJE,"Great box set, most anticipated! Like most people on this side of the world I only knew and grew up with Voltron and not Golion. As a young kid it didn't make a difference, it was all new to me. Same with Robotech. Now is a different story...

Anyway, whoever buys this set thinking this is just Voltron in Japanese should be slapped on the face. If you don't know anything about old Japanese animation and just want to relive childhood memories, do yourself a favor and buy the Voltron box sets. Please don't spoil the rating of a good product because of your ignorant expectations.

This is for the fan of Japanese animation, specifically old/classic anime which is the best as far as I'm concerned.
Golion just like many other anime series of its kind contains violence, LOTS of it, the main storyline usually carries on from episode 1 to the end. The overall approach is more realistic/dramatic inside its own fantastic universe of course. The characters are vulnerable, they have emotions, they can die and they know it so they act accordingly. That's partly what makes these shows so good and enjoyable. The other part is the action and designs along with old school hand drawn animation.

The picture and audio quality are very nice and crisp, they did a fine job. This IS an old show after all so don't go confusing good quality of old animation filmed with OLD equipment with THX top of the line digital technology of today! It's very clean and is as good as it's going to get unless George Lucas picks it up! (<joke)
Included is the original Japanese audio with optional English subtitles. That's all you get and that's all you need.
Oh yeah... no extras...sorry, it would have been nice to see some toy commercials or promo spots, but who knows what copyright/money mayhem lurks behind all these foreign series...

The only negative thing that I could point out is the cover artwork.  I would have honestly preferred an actual original Golion illustration or promotional Japanese artwork of the time as opposed to this modern American comic book look.

A really HUGE THANK YOU to AnimeWorks and WEP for doing this.  It was worth the long wait!  I wish more series like this would be released for the American audience but unfortunately it wouldn't have that big of a market. I'm talking about Mazinger Z,the original Getter Robo, Jeeg, Daimos, Combattler, Gaiking and so many other amazing series from the 70s and 80s! oh well...
Please don't stop with Golion, DO release Dairugger XV!!!! (<""vehicle Voltron"").",1213920000,9,2521,4.752860411899314
