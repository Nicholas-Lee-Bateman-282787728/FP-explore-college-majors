8740822,2,B017VXINI4,"As a huge Michael Amott/Arch Enemy fan I was excited to get another live performance on DVD, and this time with new guitarist Jeff Loomis. Visually, it is well done and I really appreciate all of the official videos being included with the package. Loomis' performance is visually clear and very audible, but whenever Amott takes a solo, the signal drops to a very low volume and you can barely hear his playing. That fact really disappointed me with this purchase. I am hoping their new live DVD; As The Stages Burn, has a better audio mix.",1489363200,,541,4.587628865979381
