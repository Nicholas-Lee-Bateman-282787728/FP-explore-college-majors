2797610,4,B000ONVCEQ,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas. I don't know if this is the case for all of them, but we watched Casino Royale and discovered the menu is in a logographic language (Chinese or Japanese, maybe. I am ignorant on these matters.) It was not a setting on our DVD player. The menu was easy enough to navigate intuitively or based on the general format of menus on DVDs. Once we hit play the movie played perfectly -- in English (sigh of relief).",1200614400,6,452,4.329411764705882
8185698,1,B000ONVCEQ,I cannot be assured that the dvd I am viewing will not freeze. I have cleaned the offending disks to no avail. Also I find I cannot eliminate the subtitles which I find terribly distracting. I am definitely not happy with this set. Had I known this I would not have purchased the set.,1258848000,,284,4.277777777777778
8185699,5,B000ONVCEQ,I watched most of the James Bonds Collection. They played fine. I just had to TURN OFF the Sub-Title caption of the movie. But all movies played fine and in ENGLISH. No Sub-Titles if requested on the MENU options. THANK YOU for the Collection and I will ENJOY watching these James Bond Classics OVER and OVER again..,1239494400,,316,4.56140350877193
8185700,3,B000ONVCEQ,"They mostly work, whatever copied a couple of these really eat the write wring up on a couple and the movie skip's a little.  I guess it's true, you get what you pay for.",1234742400,,170,4.0
8185701,3,B000ONVCEQ,"This is a great collection to have, but there was no mention of the format that the movies were in. On every movie, the words show up along the bottom, like closed captioning, and it can't be turned off. That's kind-of annoying, it takes away from the movies. I would have looked for a different set of the movies had I known that.",1231200000,,331,4.26984126984127
8185702,4,B000ONVCEQ,The product came packaged with all of the DVD's but each of them has a Japanese cover with writing on them and were all programmed with subtitles that had to be programmed off. The gift went over great but I just wish we would have had a little better result for the money we paid!,1230249600,,281,4.127272727272727
8185703,5,B000ONVCEQ,"This video collection is TOPS!!!!  There are eng;lish sub-titles on most of the dvd's, but that doesn't interfere with the quality of them.  Good product! GREAT vendor!!!  Thanks.",1229904000,,179,5.321428571428571
8185704,1,B000ONVCEQ,"THEY JUST CAN'T GET IT RIGHT, ANYTHING PRODUCED IN CHINA IS JUNK, THAT GOES FOR POISONOUS DOG FOOD, BABY FORMULA, POISONOUS TOYS, STANDS TO REASON THEIR EXPORT BOOTLEG DVD SETS WOULDN'T BE ANY GOOD EITHER.
MY STEPFATHER PURCHASED A CAMERA, AND A BUNCH OF DVDS ON A TRIP TO CHINA LAST YEAR, CAMERA PACKED UP DVDS WOULDN'T PLAY. DON'T MEAN TO SOUND PREJUDICE BUT BUY AMERICAN, WE MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS.",1222214400,3,397,4.685714285714286
8185705,2,B000ONVCEQ,"Do not Buy this box set.  Spend a little extra and get it from another amazon supplier.  I should have.

I was amazed when I opened my shipment from Amazon and saw that the James Bond Box set I had order looked the way it did.  Background: I have been living in the Middle East (Dubai) for about 10 years - out here you can buy fake DVDs very easily. They cost about 3-5 USD each and are the latest movies - ie Someone came by my house (they ring your doorbell and open a suitcase of DVDs) asking if I wanted Hancock and Sex in the City - both still in theaters.

Point being, these pirated DVDs look exactly the same as those that I was delivered from Amazon.  The same problem with the subtitles on each movie, the wrong language menus with the cheap feel.  I would not be surprised to find out that these are in fact pirated DVDs - they certainly look the same.  Even the box is identical to the box that the pirated versions come in.

I specifically purchased this set from amazon so that I could have originals.  These are not, what a disappointment.  While the movies themselves work (despite the ever present subtitles) it is a huge disappointment.",1216598400,14,1155,4.300925925925926
8185706,5,B000ONVCEQ,"I bought this set 6 months ago. The quality is perfectly fine and cheaper than other versions. However, the last movie was added from a different set. I recommend this set to any aficionado.",1211846400,2,190,4.617647058823529
8185707,3,B000ONVCEQ,"Yes, these DVDs are viewable in the US and are in English.  They are in wide screen format and appear to have been remastered.  So the quality of the picture is very good. However, I could not turn off the subtitles on 3 of the 4 movies I watched. And I tried viewing the DVD's on 3 different brands of DVD players.",1202774400,6,315,4.064516129032258
