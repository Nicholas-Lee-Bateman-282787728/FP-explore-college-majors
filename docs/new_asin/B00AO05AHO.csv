He stumbles across a classmate and a couple warriors in a battle after school. He soon becomes part of ""The Holy Grail War"". A battle fought every so often to obtain the Holy Grail. The winner gets to make a wish. He becomes the master of a legendary warrior spirit. Her name is Saber. Togther with their ally Rin and her servant, Archer, they will fight against ruthless enemies for their 1 most precious wish.

This anime is simply amazing. It has action and drama mixed together with mythology and magic. The modern day setting with legendary mythical heroes is really cool. I normally prefer anime dramas (Kanon, Clannad, Air, etc.) over action series, but this anime combines the 2 genres very well. The voice cast, animation, story, and soundtrack are all top notch. It's a very addicting series. There are many great, and memorable characters that keep you interested in the story and wanting to know more about them. There is also a dash of comedy thrown in there to lighten the mood. It's a very well rounded series with a lot to offer. I honestly think that no matter what genre of anime you're into, Fate Stay/Night will make you a happy camper. I highly recommend it and I hope you enjoy it!",1356825600,5,1353,4.614107883817427

8555052,4,B00AO05AHO,"Visual novels and anime can seem quite similar, but this series is a perfect example of how they are different. Add a star if you love the game, but others are going to spend an awful lot of this series going, ""What?"" because even 24 episodes is not time enough to fully understand what the heck is going on no matter how beautifully animated the fight scenes are.

Essentially seven magic users assisted by seven great heroes are battling it out for the Holy Grail which will grant the winning pair a couple of wishes, and this series depicts the ""Fate"" arc fairly well, though there are a number of things that are skipped or only scratched the surface of.

Note: The ""Fate"" arc,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fate-Stay-Night-Collection-1-Blu-ray/dp/B009Q6F5WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fate / Stay Night: Collection 1 [Blu-ray</a>] and this set are essentially the same thing as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fate-Stay-Night-TV-Complete-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00LBU7K88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fate / Stay Night TV: Complete Collection [Blu-ray</a>].  The latter has a slightly improved Blu-ray picture, but whether you can even see the difference is something of a question.

8555058,4,B00AO05AHO,"I got this series because I enjoyed the prequel, Fate: Zero and I wanted to see what happened next in the story.  While this wasn't as good as the prequel it was still very enjoyable.  Keep in mind that this is based off of a visual novel that has different endings and if you enjoyed this the movie shows you another ending.

Pros:
The basic plot is interesting and has a ""Battle Royal"" theme to it.
There is some mystery as to what is going on and what will happen.
If you enjoy history like I do, you will also enjoy trying to figure out who the heroes are from history.
If you like magic and action in your anime then you should check this out.

Cons:
The anime can be slow at first.
The screen will flash green for a quick second at random and this happens on both collections 1 &2.  Sentai Filmworks will probably fix this problem if they re release the anime.

Overall this anime was worth my time and money.  I suggest you watch the prequel first as it is not only better but will make you want to keep watching more of this anime to see what happens to the characters.  Because this is based off of a game (visual novel) with multiply endings there is also a movie that came out later, ""Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works"" which shows you another ending.",1401321600,,1266,4.2677824267782425
