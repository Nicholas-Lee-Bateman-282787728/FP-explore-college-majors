7861697,5,6304053193,"This program, which was produced by the Wall Street Journal, originally aired on PBS television in 1996, where I first saw it. I eventually purchased the VHS tape for reference material for a report I was writing for a college economics class I had at the time. Watching it now in 2017, it serves as an interesting time capsule of where Brazil's economy was in the mid 1990s and how its trajectory differed from that of the USA. Of course, so much has happened in the two decades since host Pedro Bial traveled all over his homeland re-discovering his country; so many ups and downs that Brazil has gone through. Perhaps Bial said it best in the program by stating that it will not be a straight road for Brazil in terms of its economy. It certainly has not been for Brazil.

As I said, this program serves as more of a time capsule as much of the data given is now obsolete. That said, it could be useful for researchers and historians looking into the Brazilian economy of the mid 1990s and its relation to the US and global economies.",1484092800,,1037,4.429319371727749
