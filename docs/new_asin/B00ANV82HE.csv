5461658,4,B00ANV82HE,"""Do you still have that disease where you finish each other's sentences?"" someone asks of Jennifer and Kevin. Ever since Kevin moved into Jennifer's neighborhood back when they were both six, they've been inseparable best pals. Their friendship's stood the test of time, from childhood to college. Past that, it's even stood Kevin's sponging off Jennifer for the past seven years as her non-rent-paying roommate at the house she'd saved up for and purchased. Jennifer (Natalie Hall) works hard and has a thriving career to show for it. Conversely, Kevin (an impish Darin Brooks) is a slacker, and, perhaps someday, his caddying at the local golf course and designing of board games at home will pay off. But, no, don't hold your breath.

Here's the thing: Bryce, Jennifer's boyfriend of six months, has just proposed to her, and he means to move into her house right after the wedding. And Bryce cannot stand Kevin, thinks he's a parasite (okay, he's maybe not wrong). Jennifer has always had Kevin's back. She doesn't want to hurt her best friend by evicting him, but she's advised that maybe this is what Kevin needs so that he can finally stand on his own. Kevin, when told this, is aghast, horrified that he's being asked to move out but also that Jennifer actually agreed to marry Bryce, a corporate slimeball whom Kevin feels is absolutely wrong for her.

...Some SPOILERS now, beginning immediately...

And when Kevin learns of Bryce's unfaithfulness, he jumps at an escape clause. His law student brother informs him that, legally, seven years of cohabitation makes Kevin and Jennifer common law spouses. So now see how quickly Kevin rolls with that. And now Jennifer is aghast. But Kevin has always been a quitter. How long can he maintain his stance? Especially since a furious Jennifer embarks on a mission to make him cave. She begins to parcel out daily lists of chores for which a husband would typically be responsible.

The Hallmark Channel produced another winning romantic comedy in THE SEVEN YEAR HITCH. It's a sweet film and pretty funny, if predictable. The premise is marvelously offbeat and farfetched. The two leads, Darin Brooks and Natalie Hall, are engaging and create some nice moments together. I like that the movie's opening sequence sets up their backstory, and so it really feels like there's a lived-in history between them. I wish, though, that Bryce the boyfriend (the appropriately named Ryan Doom) isn't depicted as such a coldly ambitious, two-timing assshat (this is established early in the film). It telegraphs Jennifer's inevitable choice. Too, I think the ending stretched a bit too far in its try to wrap things up too neatly (I refer to what happens with Jennifer's friend and also with Kevin's law school bro). But these are fairly minor quibbles. THE SEVEN YEAR HITCH is very watchable. It's fun watching Kevin evolve from slacker to Mr. Responsible. It's even more fun watching Jennifer's reaction to it. Still, the best bit in the movie? The Gilbert & Sullivan karaoke scene, of course.",1358640000,26,3036,4.947058823529412

So when Jennifer graduates from college and begins building a career in charity, she thinks it's only right to let drop-out Kevin live in her newly purchased house until he gets back on his feet.

Seven years later, Jennifer is continuing up the career ladder while Kevin is still golf caddying and waiting for his big break. Jennifer is happy to let Kevin march to his own beat, but her new boyfriend, arrogant corporate manipulator Bryce (Ryan Doom), wants her to kick Kevin to the curb.

Oblivious to his cheating ways, Jennifer is ecstatic when Bryce asks her to marry him after only 6 months of dating, secretly using her angelic reputation to gain favor with his boss Mrs. Von Hoffman (Frances Fisher).

Eventually Kevin catches Bryce cheating and is determined to spare Jennifer an unhappily ever after experience. With a little help from his brother who is in law school, and support from his meddling neighbor Mr. Henderson (George Wendt), Kevin finds out he is legally married to Jennifer in a common law marriage after living together for exactly 7 years. Now it's up to Kevin to prove he is Jennifer's equal - forever.",1391731200,,1239,4.834905660377358

When it came on again, (thank you Hallmark!) there was less going on and more time to watch him grow into his own skin, both vocationally and personally, and appreciate his changes along the way.

Best friends/next door neighbors grow up and remain close, have a breakup, and reunite: not new ground.  But the difference here is the way in which they are forced to look at themselves more closely when pressured.  It's the little things, of course, that make a movie click with any viewer, and this one has several hooks to draw us in, from Slinkies to topiary, and from Karaoke to battle armor.

5461768,5,B00ANV82HE,I really enjoyed this movie. I first borrowed a copy from our local library. I enjoyed it so much I bought a copy. The actors are not well known but they are good. The story line is humorous and fun. Who will make the best husband the handsome boyfriend with the prestigious job or her best friend? You will have to watch to find out who she chooses.,1382918400,,350,4.161764705882353
5461769,5,B00ANV82HE,"Hallmark does it again!  Seven Year Hitch (don't ya just love the title) is cute, funny, a little serious and has all the things I like in a movie. Is the plot believable?  It may be a bit far fetched but hey, you watch a movie to get-away-from-it-all, there is enough reality in the world.  The characters a full of life and I just fell in love with Kevin.  What a neat guy.  Jennifer is an excellent leading lady.  Together they had a chemistry that was great!  I really appreciate that this is a clean movie.  It's one that I purchased to add to my library of favorites to be enjoyed again and again. My husband liked it too. Seven Year Hitch comes highly recommended from this gal!",1380499200,,685,4.296875
5461770,5,B00ANV82HE,"The movie has a beautiful story line to it and loved the actors. But there is a problem with the DVD!! The first one played perfect until the end then started skipping, freezing and pixiling. It skipped so bad at the end that you could not tell how it ends even though I have already seen it on hallmark. I sent that one back received the second DVD and it did the same thing at the end but not as bad. Got through the end this time but again with some pixiling, skipping and freezing. So beware, something wrong with these DVD's. Amazon is returning my money as they are not going to let me exchange again. Bought elsewhere, so we will see if the same thing happens!!

Update: Received another copy from E-bay this time it's perfect. No pixiling, skipping or freezing. Played through with no hitches. Amazon must have gotten a bad batch of these and I unfortunately received two copy's that were bad so beware!!",1379980800,,912,4.428571428571429

5461797,4,B00ANV82HE,"I just finished watching The Seven Year Hitch due on DVD March 5th. In two words, it was adorably sweet.

Jennifer and Kevin have been best friends since he moved onto her block when they were both 6. Fast forward to Jennifer graduating from college as she talks to her two friends about allowing Kevin to live with her for about two weeks while he gets his feet on the ground. Fast forward another 7 years, and we see a professional Jennifer getting ready for work while her friend Kevin hands her her lunch. They are still roommates with Jennifer moving up the career ladder, while fun loving Kevin works on a board game idea and works as a golf caddy.  When Jennifer's cheating boyfriend Bryce of six months proposes, Kevin must figure out a way for Jennifer to see on her own what a bad move it would be for her.

I thought the movie was a adorable. Darin Brooks (Kevin) is charming, quirky and sweet. He reminded me of Johnny Depp in Benny and Joon without the cane and long hair. He has a sweet smile and was perfect as the long time loyal ""guy"" friend.

 Natalie Hall as Jennifer was as adorable as Darin with her super white teeth and sweet smile.

The Seven Year Hitch is exactly what I would expect from A Hallmark Movie. Charming, funny, sweet, and soft. Although predictable, I enjoyed every moment especially Kevin using their ""common law"" arrangement as a way to keep Jennifer from marrying Bryce.

The movie also received the Dove Family Approved Stamp so feel free to watch around your kids!",1361491200,2,1507,4.498168498168498
