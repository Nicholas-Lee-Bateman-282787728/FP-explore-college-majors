8556383,5,B000S1ITRW,"All of Dick Sutphen's vhs tapes are outstanding but this one is perhaps the best. It has been used by many people in 12 step programs to help them to overcome their addictions, learn to accept and love themselves, and to become more independent. I highly recommend this as an excellent meditation exercise that is both visual and auditory. It has hypnotic effects on eight different levels including positive sublimnal messages.",1371168000,,428,5.042253521126761
