This is really not much of a movie if you're expecting a storyline, and it is a little slow getting started, but the information given on the migrations and life cycle of the penguins is truly remarkable and worth the (price).  (DVD was transferred from film, so picture quality may not be what you'd expect from a DVD!)",1006473600,8,399,4.4520547945205475
1418950,5,B00005AWR8,"I loved the film but should point out that I'm the only reviewer I have ever come across that seems so to do. I watched this a long time ago and have been searching for a copy of the film ever since. The Antarctic scenes are beautiful and John Hurt plays his character with sympathetic flair. If you're an animal lover and relish the thought of a film filmed mainly on location in arctic conditions, then you'll love this.",969840000,10,422,4.3544303797468356
1418971,2,B00005AWR8,"The photos on the cover are of a little girl Hayley Mills and an old man John Hurt.  In the movie they are roughly the same age:  supposed to be college age.

This edition of the movie is recorded from TV or someone's video tape.  It's a homemade job.  Guess that's why it's only $5.

The movie is reminiscent of Never Cry Wolf and other movies of one man alone in the wilderness.  Hayley Mills is in about 1/3 of the movie but most of the time she and John Hurt are apart (he's off bonding with the penguins).

It's a sort of strange movie, but kind of fun to see.  It was interesting to see that John Hurt really was young once upon a time.  The time he spent with the penguins was pretty interesting, but don't get the idea that this is a romance.  It's mostly a nature film.  Maybe worth the $5, maybe not.",1234224000,,810,4.089171974522293
1418972,5,B00005AWR8,"THIS MOVIE IS WELL DONE, AND HAS A STORY THAT CAPTURES THE REALIZATION OF THE PERILS IN A PENGUINS LIFE TO SURVIVE.

1418973,3,B00005AWR8,"I agree that the first 30 minutes are fairly forgettable except for the very English loveliness of Hayley Mills. For one thing, although John Hurt gives a great performance, no one could ever buy that someone who looks like him, even a young John Hurt, could be a womanizer - except for the fact that in this film, his character apparently has lots of money left to him by his aunt.

I would not call this much of a SPOILER, so I'll continue on to say that it was rather ridiculous that a blizzard blew out a window in the Shackleton Shack only after Forbish arrives - a structure that supposedly had survived (as of the time of the filming in 1971) some 50-plus years in Antarctica.

I bought this in Wal-Mart for $1 and it was worth it for the penguin photography and behavior, as well as the realistic cruelty of nature they must endure.",1199232000,,840,4.378205128205129
1418974,4,B00005AWR8,"Ggood film about the life of the penguins, their continuous struggle for survival. Has many aspects on the need for environmental awareness.

I purchased this dvd because of the promising theme and of course because of the participation of Hayley Mills who is one of my favorite actresses.
I was not disappointed.",1194912000,14,385,4.938461538461539

1418976,4,B00005AWR8,"First of all, let me say that before I started watching this, I had no idea that it was made in the 70s.  I just knew that it was about penguins.

Along the lines of March of the Penguins, except with Adelie penguins instead of Emperor penguins, this film documents the life of penguins.  It does not go into too much detail scientifically, and it does not really explain things from a penguin's perspective.  Instead, the viewer gets the perspective from a person studying the penguins.

Overall, I thought this film was great, with a great message.  A man whose motivation for going to Antarctica is to impress a girl ends up having a more compassionate outlook on life after he spends time with the penguins and begins to truly care about them.  Towards the end of the film, there is even a hint of realization that humans take whatever they want from other species with no excuse.  Of course, the main character gets the girl in the end, but she also realizes that there is more to life than the human realm.

The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is for the horrible quality of the film (even on DVD) and for the slow story line in the first portion of the film, before John Hurt's character arrives in Antarctica.",1164758400,,1220,4.434977578475336
1418977,4,B00005AWR8,"Hayley Mills' character is the impetus for John Hurt's character to go to the Antarctic, but she has little screen time compared to the wonderful creatures that are the centerpiece of this film.  Beautiful photography (Arne Sucksdorff, Dir. of Photography)highlights Mr. Hurt's struggles with nature.  While a bit dated in the bits in London, Nature is never dated and the increasing empathy between the scientist and his subjects is touching and heart-warming. Some of the scenes are not for small children or even some large ones, but the film is a treasure.-+",1142899200,2,562,5.0978260869565215
1418978,3,B00005AWR8,"An ambitious claim for a film? - let me explain...

When I was 13 or 14, sometime many years ago, I was off school laying on the sofa with some real or imagined illness. In the afternoon, this film came on the tv. I thought - Wow that looks great I'd like to go to Antarctica!

So when I grew up I did - as a marine biologist. If I hadn't then my life would have taken a different path - so ""This film could change your life"" - it did mine.

3 stars, because it's not really that great as films go, but I am glad I saw it that afternoon in the 70's.",1134086400,11,549,3.756521739130435
1418979,4,B00005AWR8,"This film is the only English language film made by a Norwegian(?) director and easily qualifies as being one of the strangest most patchy films I have ever seen.
The story is simple enough. John Hurt playes Forbrush, a spoilt rich post graduate student who is supposed to be studying biology at the University of London. He is very good in his chosen field, but is largely wasting his time drinking and chasing women. He decides that he wants to impress Hayley Mills, and semi- accidentally gets signed up for a 6 month tour studying penguins on his own in Antarctica. Once there, his loneliness drives him half mad, and he becomes paternally attached to the penguins he is supposed to be studying. In the course of the six months he grows up and becomes an adult as opposed to the fop that he was
The first half hour of the film is almost excrutiating. John Hurt wades through an appalling script (by none other than Anthony Shaffer) and does his best to be drunk and fey and enamoured by Hayley Mills. This part of the the film resembles an Ealing Comedy forged by a drunk Estonian. Once the story arrives in Antarctica, things pick up. Hurt's acting improves markedly, and the penguins start trying to steal the show. There is a heavy duty snowstorm, heaps of literally astonishing scenery, and Hurt starts chewing the scenery as he goes mad.
The main thing wrong with this film is the script. The dialogue is frequently stilted and shows a poor understanding of motivation and character. (Particularly in the earlier scenes). To make matters worse, the direction is thoroughly uninspired. The odd thing though, is that the spirit of the film shines through these mechanics. This was a film made in hardship, and made with love. You CARE for Hurt as he grows up, you can see why he becomes attached to the penguins, why he hates the Skuas, and how his time alone and his hardship makes him grow into a far improved version of his earlier self.
While it is far from being the best made film that you will ever see, I think that this film's spirit will live with you for a long time. Anyone who has ever needed adventure in their life, will understand and probably love the journey that this film delivers.
The DVD master is appalling. There are almost random changes in aspect ratio, from 1.85.1 (occasionally) through to the standard 4.3 fullscreen. There are frequent major distrubances in the image, partly caused by bad storage of the original film, and partly by what looks like a semi-broken telecine machine.
That said, I am glad I own this one. It makes me feel happy to watch it and it makes me think. While it is a curiosity its' whole adds up to far more than the sum of its parts.
...And it is definitely one of the oddest films ever made.",1017187200,36,2754,4.554435483870968
1418980,1,B00005AWR8,"This is not a great movie. It is best appreciated by Hayley Mills'true blue fans (also if you love penguins, lol).  She is very beautiful and gives an acceptable performance.  However, she is very mismatched with the leading man who gives a very lack luster performance, and his sole goal seems to be to get Hayley's character to sleep with him. It's a boring film, with a lousy story outline. So, you may want to save your money.",1016323200,7,430,4.5

.
CRY OF THE PENGUINS was released in Britain as ""Mr. Forbush and the Penguins."" It's a fascinating picture, one that everybody should see.

Filmed for the most part in Antarctica, it's the story of Richard Forbush, a biologist who travels to the South Pole not for a research opportunity but to impress a girl he recently met. He endures long days of solitary hardships in a hovel built decades earlier by Antarctic pioneer Ernest Shackleford. When the penguins arrive in droves however, these miseries are quickly forgotten.

To his delight, Forbush is allowed to walk among and study them carefully. His concern for these cute birds grows when it's clear that predatory skuas are killing large quantities of chicks and destroying unhatced eggs. Forbush tries to find a way to defeat this foe.

7936001,1,B00005AWR8,"This movie was totally worthless, kick myself for ever buying it. Watched half and through it away so nothing interesting about the movie at all.",1319760000,,145,4.84
7936002,2,B00005AWR8,"Richard Forbush (John Hurt) is a part-time biology student and full-time playboy in swinging London.  He has no trouble attracting the ladies until he meets the lovely Tara (Hayley Mills) who is immune to his charms.  Determined to impress her, he takes a job studying penguins for six months in Antarctica - alone.

First of all, the picture and sound quality on this DVD are terrible.  While the movie is filmed in color, the part set in Antarctica is just gray, with no blue skies or water even on sunny days.  The script is predictable and clich&eacute;, too.  It is quite interesting to see John Hurt as a young swinger if you've only seen him as Harry Potter's ""Mr. Ollivander,"" but he's hardly convincing as a lady-killer.  Thankfully he does mature as he endures the rigors of Antarctica and falls in love with the penguins.

The second half of the movie is semi-documentary with Forbush's dry, sarcastic commentary adding some humor, but the focus is on him, not nature.  We never spend time with or really engage with the penguins because the photography is jerky and rushed.  This movie doesn't hold a candle to more beautiful and emotionally-compelling movies like ""March of the Penguins;"" it's just a low-budget look at a self-centered man who grows up while living among the penguins.",1287705600,,1298,4.832579185520362
