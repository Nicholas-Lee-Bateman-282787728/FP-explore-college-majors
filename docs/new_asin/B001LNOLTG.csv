8319195,5,B001LNOLTG,"This is not my favorite Tom Keene movie, but I liked it very much.  It appears Tom is a questionable character accompanied by two side-kicks who have a shady past.  After arriving in a town run by the villains Tom agrees to work for the heroine (played by Sheila Bromley, also a favorite) and her dad on their cattle ranch.  A powerful woman ranch owner is stealing their cattle and luring their hired hands away.  Ultimately the plot thickens with the hero turning out to be a true blue good guy and everyone wins.  The movie was made in 1932 and is 54 minutes long, black and white, of course.  Love those 30s movies!",1373414400,,619,4.385964912280702
