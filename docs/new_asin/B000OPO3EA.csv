8363390,4,B000OPO3EA,"Even though the episodes on these DVDs are only 30 min each and should be reduced to one volume, I still think it is a worthwhile investment.  The animators did not sterilize the Tales for kids with oversensitive parents, which is greatly appreciated.  My kids love these and ask to watch them all the time.  I don't know what the seller is thinking that has just volume one listed for $250, though.  I bought all three volumes on sale for $59 from Schlessinger (normal price is $120, I think).  So, get them - but not from that guy.",1320192000,2,533,4.3979591836734695
