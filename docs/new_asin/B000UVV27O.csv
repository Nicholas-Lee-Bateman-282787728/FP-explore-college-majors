8215200,2,B000UVV27O,Not much information here. First disk was super basic. Second was mainly on tells. third was for online which I can't use now. Waste of money,1421625600,,141,4.461538461538462
8215201,4,B000UVV27O,"If you are new to Texas hold em, a very good set of videos to invest in.
Even experienced players will pick up tips that may help win a hand in
a crucial spot. Never can have too much info to evaluate your own
playing style. Would love to see a video of Annie actually playing and
explaining her strategy after the fact.",1249257600,2,320,4.095238095238095
8215202,5,B000UVV27O,"Whether you are just starting out at playing Texas Hold 'em or have been playing for years, these videos will be more than helpful.  If you are new, the beginners guide will teach you how to get started, basic strategy and the rules.  The other videos will teach you how to play in a casino situation and, especially helpful, ONLINE poker.  There are vast differences in how to play online vs. in person and Annie gives you all the tips!

Ms. Duke explains things so well, you become so anxious to try them out!  Especially the ""tells""  You really start to become more aware of peoples habits.  You can even read people online with her valuable tips.",1244851200,6,650,4.504273504273504
8215203,3,B000UVV27O,"Talk about low budget...Duke explains the very basics of the game and shows why she is so well liked, but the video is not well scripted and we just threw it away after watching it once.  Still, it's probably good enough for someone who has never seen a hold'em game.",1222387200,3,267,4.34
8215204,5,B000UVV27O,I heard that Annie Duke DVDs were the best out there but I was surprised to see for myself how honestly helpful they are for poker players.  They are right on the money for all aspects of poker.  If you get poker DVDs you owe it to yourself to include Annie's works in your library.,1220832000,2,282,4.109090909090909
8215205,5,B000UVV27O,These videos are GREAT for the amatuer beginning to mid-range player.  Many of the ideas and concepts are even helpful to the advanced player.  I attended her seminar in Las Vegas in 2005.....the concepts taught on the DVD's are just as good as her seminar.  A must buy for any beginning to mid-range player regardless of your gender.,1213401600,3,334,4.724137931034483
