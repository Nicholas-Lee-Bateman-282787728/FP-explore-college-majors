4676395,5,B005FITIGO,"well done very entertaining, I found the end a bit of a fast cut but still makes sense !!
highly recommended and worth watching",1319846400,,127,4.333333333333333
4676396,5,B005FITIGO,"i've seen the inside job,(excellent) and too big to fail,(kinda thought they made wall street almost look sympathetic in it's insanity) but this movie kinda explores it from a different side than the before mentioned. it kinda pinpoints the zero point of the (2008)calamity to a small group of excellent actors, and it unravels in a blunt way about three quarters of the way through when the ""solution"" is decided, that quite consicely sums up walls streets attitude toward anyone but themselves.

i had no idea what the movie was really gonna be about, and unlike inside job or too big to fail it keeps it's scope very narrow, and very focused on the specifics of the begining hours or the calamity. casper the ghost(from priest, a beautiful mind) does a great job, as does kevin spacey, and the guy from hero's was surprisingly convincing.
and i watched it twice.

i gave it 5 stars cause 1)it's bound to be underrated 2) acting's great and really excellent, (the begining scene of a manager getting fired, he just sits listening, but his face is so expressive) and 3) the flow is really great. there weren't any moments of ""oh god how much more"" or ""hmm...could've done without that lengthy collage of pensive faces.""
obviously if you're not interested in the subject, maybe zonk out to captain america(i'm not judging, probably watch it myself someday) but if you're into it, check this out.
very, very cool.",1319846400,7,1412,4.782786885245901
4676397,5,B005FITIGO,"MARGIN CALL is a 24 hour distillation of an example of the economic meltdown this country and the world has been and is currently experiencing. Though the film is very well crafted and is populated with some of our finest actors it is an exceptionally disturbing look at greed and all its permutations. The only aspect of the film that makes it less devastating to watch is the manner in which the story is told - through the eyes of the people involved in the crisis and how it affects them as well as those they have financially and morally abused and destroyed.

The film opens with the Investment Banking downsizing firing of Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), a veteran of 19 years with the firm who is on the brink of making a shattering discovery. His boss Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey) simply tells him he is through and has him escorted out of the building, cutting off all ties with the firm: Eric passes a file to one of his young co- workers, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) as he is exiting the building via the elevator stating 'Be Careful'. During the day many others are let go and informed of their separation packages. Tension builds as Peter downloads the information form Eric and discovers that the firm is on th brink of destruction form greedy overselling to clients: collapse seems imminent. It is now night and Peter calls his co-worker Seth (Penn Badgley) back to the office along with another boos Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) and as the situation terrifies them all they inform the Human Resources people Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore) who realize the gravity of the situation and ask the owner of the firm John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) to come to the firm in the middle of the night to inform him of the calamity. The only choice seems to be to sell out everything and close the company, an act that would further betray the clients of the firm and causes considerable conflict among the firm's staff. Everyone seems to trust Sam and will follow his advice as to go through with the questionable sell junk bonds to loyal clients in order to not collapse. Each of the people involved in the action has a personal fear, and Sam is particularly vulnerable because he has been informed his beloved dog is dying from a tumor (one of the few suggestions that these people may have a vulnerable aspect to their psyches. How the announcement is made and the actions taken as the sun comes up on this night of terror gives the audience a first hand look of that hideous moment in 2008 when the markets failed, injuring millions of people's lives.

JC Chandor wrote and directed this film and offers an impressive debut - and a lot of courage bringing a film with this topic to the screens at this point in time. Many viewers may find that there is too little character development in this script, but consider the time frame of the film - less than 24 hours in one of the worst crises of this country - and realize that this may be a statement about the corporate personality: no matter the gravity of the result of crashing they think basically about their job stability. Every one in the cast is memorable, right up to the end of the film when we finally meet Mary McDonnell as Sam's ex-wife questioning Sam's digging a grave for his dog in his previous home's yard. It is a moment of agony that adds a smidgen of idea that the characters involved so indeed have souls.

This is a very disturbing film about a very disturbing subject, made all the more disturbing by the fact that it forces us to look at an act the affected the lives of all of us. As Eric says on the elevator leaving the building, 'Be careful.' Grady Harp, October 11",1319587200,15,3668,4.512781954887218
4676398,5,B005FITIGO,"I have tried many a time to get in the head of the people that are part of these financial institutions and try to understand their mindset.  I have read 5 books on the subject and just had a hard time believing that people could do such a thing.  After seeing this movie, I feel I have a better understanding of the human character and environment in which this happened in.
To put it plainly I could see where I could have ended up working for an institution and been torn between my personal survival and complete unethical traitorous behaviour.  None of these guys seem like the devil incarnate, it just so happens that the consequences of their actions have huge consequences for millions of people.
It's just business.",1319500800,6,724,4.596899224806202
4676399,4,B005FITIGO,"Having been the victim of corporate downsizing more than once, I was immediately engaged with this propulsive 2011 corporate drama from the beginning as Stanley Tucci's character, a seasoned risk management executive named Eric Dale, is told in a coldly indifferent manner that he is being laid off after 19 years with the same unnamed Wall Street firm. It's a piercing yet dramatically economical scene that perfectly summarizes how bloodless the corporate world can be, and in first-time writer/director J.C. Chandor's effort set on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis, it is very cold indeed with 80% of the trading floor being let go. As Dale is escorted out of the building, he hands a flash drive to his prodigious assistant Peter Sullivan and tells him to take a look at it and ""Be careful.""

Once Sullivan analyzes the data, he realizes the universal gravity of Dale's warning - that the firm is so over-committed to underwater mortgage-backed securities that the total potential loss exceeds the firm's total market capitalization value. In other words, the projected scenario means the firm will soon owe a lot more than it's worth, and the market will be on the verge of an apocalyptic meltdown. What happens after this discovery is a series of sharply intense clandestine confrontations with each level of higher-ups recognizing the ramifications of the inevitable disaster, each one far more nuanced in character than we are used to seeing in films from Oliver Stone about greed and immorality. Blessedly, Chandor doesn't stoop to the customary stereotypes in this corporate cage match, but what he does manage is capture the moral compass underneath each player by way of a cast that really delivers the goods with powerfully implosive performances.

Zachary Quinto (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B002HWRYJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>) is initially at the center of the plot as Sullivan and performs well enough in the constraining, semi-heroic role, but the veterans really stand out here beginning with Kevin Spacey, who effectively plays against type as Sam Rogers, a genuine company man, the seen-it-all head of the trading team who rallies what's left of the trading floor with corporate brio but then faces his own cross to bear struggling to commandeer a fire sale of worthless assets dumped on unsuspecting clients. The other standout is Jeremy Irons, who masterfully resuscitates the cool cunning of his Claus von Bulow from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reversal-of-Fortune/dp/B000056BP3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reversal of Fortune</a>&nbsp;as the acerbically survivalist CEO John Tuld. He handily controls the boardroom scene with cutting humor and hostile precision. One of the film's more pleasant surprises is Demi Moore in cool, brisk form as Sarah Robertson, the top risk officer and lone female executive who knows her career is at stake with the discovery of this folly. Tucci is excellent in his smallish role as Dale and gets to show off his resigned character's engineering aptitude with a brief monologue about building a bridge.

Comparatively less impressive but playing their more predictable roles fitfully are Penn Badgley as Sullivan's younger, overtly money-obsessed colleague Seth Bregman; Paul Bettany as Dale's nihilistic, snake-oil salesman of a boss, Will Emerson; and Simon Baker as the most morally despicable executive of the bunch, Jared Cohen. Mary McDonnell has a brief and frankly unnecessary scene as Rogers' ex-wife, and I didn't even recognize the usually hilarious Broadway personality Susan Blackwell as the hatchet woman in the opening scene. There are a few flaws with Chandor's observant screenplay, for example, the overly analogous scenes of Rogers dealing with his dying dog and a rooftop scene that plays up Emerson's nihilistic nature too predictably. In addition, some scenes play either too murkily or too clinically to achieve the precise dramatic effect they should. I think the absence of a musical score also contributes to the sterility of the proceedings. However, as a first-time filmmaker, Chandor more than impresses with his deft handling of such a zeitgeist moment with the Occupy Wall Street protests gaining understandable momentum right now.",1319328000,257,4341,5.574242424242424
4676400,3,B005FITIGO,"I liked the acting.  Stanley Tucci is particularly good, but ""Margin Call"" isn't a very deep or insightful movie about the Wall Street crisis.
Find ""Too Big to Fail"" on HBO first.",1319328000,4,179,4.59375
4676401,3,B005FITIGO,"This movie has a wonderful cast and a great topic, but it was really rather dull.  Stanley Tucci was great as always, along with Kevin Spacey's guy you love to hate.  The casting of the young analysts in the company was well done, even down to the ""all about me"" perspective ...but I kept waiting for something to grab me, but it didn't.",1319328000,7,337,4.333333333333333
4676402,4,B005FITIGO,"The only guy who knows that the company is screwed just got laid off. This begins a compelling drama based somewhat on the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.  To be clear, this is not a thriller and it's not a fictionalized retelling of the Lehman collapse.  It's a conventional drama.  And most of the story takes place in a single building.

The film dramatizes what the executives did in the 24 hours after they realized they were sitting on billions in worthless assets. ""So, what you're telling me is that the music is about to stop and we're gonna be left holding the biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism.""  That's the big cheese played by Jeremy Irons. He concocts a scheme to dump the assets on unsuspecting buyers within a single business day. His underling opposes the idea. Kevin Spacey plays the underling and he's pretty awesome.

People who liked ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", which was a film based on strong performances and sharp dialogue might like this film. Otherwise, the film might just look like a bunch of talking heads. The movie examines the behavior of people in a crisis and their motivations. The most memorable lines comes from Jeremy Irons: ""It's just money. It's made up. Just pieces of paper with pictures on it, so we don't have to kill each other to get something to eat."" I didn't like the way the movie ended.  But I guess it's true to life that way.",1319328000,26,1422,4.619047619047619

Having now done so, I would recommend this to anyone interested in looking behind the curtain to the events that led to the finical crisis that hit in 2008. Granted, this is a fictionalized version of what happened at Lehman Brothers, but is compelling none the less. Outstanding performances by Stanley Tucci, Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto, Simon Baker, and Demi Moore.

4676499,4,B005FITIGO,"I enjoyed watching this movie about the stock market fiasco. I juxtaposed this movie with another movie called, ""The Big Short.""  You really need to see both movies to get different perspectives as to what happened during that market downturn.  Margin Call is one take based on the analysis of two individuals who project a disaster for their firm, and heads start to role when the stuff hits the fan. The losers in both movies are of course, the common folk who buy into the market, buy a home, mortgage, etc.  This was a sad period of time in the United States.  I can remember the only one who got this right (the bubble burst) was Nouriel Roubini.  The one who initiated this disaster was Alan Greenspan in my humble opinion.  He layed the ground work for this disaster with his fed policies.  Of course this is debatable forever.

4676536,4,B005FITIGO,"For intellectually-minded readers, a wonderful alternative vision of a response to the collapse of the speculative crisis of 2008 is the 1973 book by John Kenneth Galbraith ""Economics and the Public Purpose"".
This can be most usefully followed-up by ""The Price if Inequality"" and ""Re-writing the Rules of the American Economy"" by Joseph E. Stieglitz, the Nobel-winning economist.  His book, ""Freefall""  about the 2001 financial debacle is also important.
IMO. from 2001 through the debacle in 2007-08, Wall Street titans and federal regulators, the President and Executive Branch, and most of Congress were criminally negligent in not quickly stopping the sub-prime mortgage fraud by originators and appraisers and the ensuing derivatives and re-insurance frauds.  None had the moral development to stop pocketing the fees and bribes. To my knowledge only a single Swiss banker was ever charged (guilty).  Our great-great grandchildren will still be paying for the $3 trillion bailout while two thousand bankers, regulators, appraisers, etc. should still be in jail for another twenty years.  This problem is still not nearly fixed although Elizabeth Warren has already called for re-instating Glass-Steagel as a first step in a more transparent, firmly regulated environment.

4676654,2,B005FITIGO,"i just watched this on Prime.  Margin Call contains some excellent performances from Kevin Spacey and Stanley Tucci but several characters are redundant (Penn Badgley's role) and some of the story line was a bit questionable.  For example, when they laid people off, a big deal was made of terminating their corporate cell phone service, but they still let people keep the phone.  Stanley Tucci still had the key/file to a corporate computer which he passed on to a low level analyst who found the missing links, so much for confidentiality, he knew the computer password?  The security guard who was so careful at making sure people left wasn't doing a very good job.  The 2 low level analysts were permitted to attend executive committee meetings and make presentations, that would have never happened, someone in management would have obtained the facts and made the presentation.  Upper level management with the exception of Kevin Spacey didn't know what anyone else did.  Demi Moore's character got fired and they let her participate in critical decision making after the fact.  Everyone was up all night brainstorming but they all looked fresh and rested.  People brought open liquor bottles into the office and drank on the job.  The story line about sending employees out to someone's home without their permission to drag them back to the office after they had been terminated without security clearance didn't make sense.  It was a lot easier to get into that place then it was to get out.  If this is how Lehman Brothers, on which this story was based, ran things, it's no wonder they got into trouble.",1494633600,,1614,4.893382352941177
4676655,3,B005FITIGO,"I've seen all of the rest of the high reviews given by various Amazon Prime Members who've watched this film. Now, I can understand why they would give it such praise because of its focus on how hard it's to keep your moral values intact as a businessperson on Wall Street. On the other hand, I was totally confused by the economic terminology mentioned in the film thereby making it hard to decipher the underlying stories within the general premise itself. My gut instinct for anyone interested in working on Wall Street or as an entrepreneur would be to watch this film because it will teach you to hold your moral values close in all situations though for everyone else it might be a tossup.

But for what it's worth, it's very entertaining. That's probably largely due to Kevin Spacey and Paul Bettany (who really stole the show here for me). This movie is not something I would rewatch. I'd definitely not recommend it for those who really want to know how the financial crisis of 2008 was set into motion. I understand the production was low-budget, but the ""fire sale"" was sorely disappointing and not realistic. Also I didn't care for the ending at all. If you really want to see this kind of portrayal on a broader scale, I suggest The Big Short.

I like how one of the characters draw the rest of us into the film, in basically saying we have our lifestyles, with expensive homes we can't afford, but nice lifestyles, and that's only possible because of what they do.  His comments might be considered cynical by some, but they were so true.  This scene was my favorite part of the film.  Another scene that was especially poignant was where Spacey's character in digging in his once front yard, when his ex Wife comes out of his ex house, and asks him what he is doing.
Well he says he burying the dog, because this is where She belonged. No home, No Wife and now no dog.  The house is a mansion, and the Wife seems like a lovely person, and Spacey is a Good Man,  but everything he obviously built up, was gone for him.

Unfortunately, as always, a few top rotten apples is all it takes to contaminate the whole basket. And the solution is simple: all the bottom ones must be discarded...first.
School book formula is a true bible to modern businesses,
CTB = DWIT*(U + C))/Z,
Whereas,
DoWhatEverItTakes denotes DWIT.
Unethical is U.
Cheating is C.
Lastly Zero is, of course, Z.
And all lead to Cook The Book.
It is frightening to see how far one would go to such a great length to apply the C and U in their business models!
But it happens over and over again when those with over 20 years died off, and/or fade out of existence.
My generation was 2001, witnessed and experienced first hand fresh out of college--followed by a painful 2006.
When will that next generation come.
So who can say money is just a piece of paper.

Reasons mainly are that this is a much more intellectual movie. You don't have to be super smart, though some understanding of the market would help those watching, you really just have to enjoy sitting and watching a movie that is much more dramatic in an intellectual sense, than in a violent or sexy sense. That is largely the difference in reviews.

4677092,2,B005FITIGO,"Let me say this before I begin. You will be able to get through the movie all the way until the end but I do not think they should have wasted money to produce this movie. The movie did not bring anything worth while to the table. This was another major company that fell and was not going down without a fight. The acting was not the problem, actually the characters did a great job and that is what really kept this movie together. Without the good acting I just don't know if this movie would have been worth watching. There was no plot in the movie. Just the idea of the corporation falling, everybody panicking and the constant idea of money. You can not produce a entire movie off of that concept. This had the potential to be a good suspenseful mystery. I kept waiting around thinking there had to be some big twist that was going to save the movie and being everything together. But when the end came and the credits appeared on the screen all I could do was shake my head. With all that being said, on some of the other reviews I saw some people say this was this producer's first movie. So I will be easy on him. Sometimes our first work is not the best but then other movies will be better when we gain more experience. So for his first movie I will say he did a good job in at least keeping the audience's attention until the end of the movie. But there needed to be more in the movie than the idea of a large corporation falling and laying off employees without a moment's doubt. Although that does happen with small and big companies everyday, I needed to be invested in the movie by some link that I could identify with that made this movie different from the typical movies about lay offs.

Funny aspect of what was presented is that it so closely resembled what key bunkos in the fraud and theft industry did leading from the felony illegal seizure of all stocks from owners in October 2007 when the brutally corrupt Securities & Exchange Commission authorized those felony abrogations of Article IV of the US Constitution Amendments.  Having two of the executives discussing strategy in front of a cleaning lady also seemed a major breach of rationality.  But certainly no less so than having the Giant Squid leaching on the face of America and its ""too big to be honest"" peers bailed out at taxpayer expense by Frauderal legis critters in the aftermath of the real world version.

[The Glass-Steagal Act, also known as the Banking Act of 1933 (48 Stat. 162), was passed by Congress in 1933 and prohibits commercial banks from engaging in the investment business.

It looks like a huge budget given to a very inexperienced filmmaker. An hour into it the story, instead of peaking in drama, feels to completely run out of steam, the scene of Paul Bettany driving to Brooklyn and back is just so laborious, flat and boring, he himself seems completely uninterested in it. Some great imagery, some good writing, some good scenes (like the one of the douchey VP (Simon Baker, excellent in this), shaving in the office bathroom and having a completely weird and awkward interaction with one of his employe they both know he is about to fire), a very interesting subject matter, in the end a tentative and shallow exercise adding up to not a whole lot. This is a movie that wants you to believe that what you are witnessing a bunch of wall streets execs and workers staying up all night, it's 4am... and yet, not a single one is yawning or is bleary eyed... Almost everything else is like this and feels off, fake, acted and stiff. Kevin Spacey inconsolable about his dead dog? You don't believe it for a minute. The ending, where the consequences of all this tension have been building up for the whole movie and are supposed to blow up in the open seems very anti-climatic. There was a great movie potential in there, a great contemporary real life drama, there certainly was the cast and the budget, but I fault the filmmakers for fumbling that one.

We are fairly removed now from the Great Financial Crisis, but this film did an excellent job of retelling a part of that story in a way that was both dramatically entertaining and substantively accurate.  The cast of characters is remarkable and the fact that no one tried to over-play the others was commendable.  Kevin Spacey is almost always great,and of course has gone on to create ever more interesting characters (House of Cards) since this film in 2011.  But Jeremy Irons, in my view, made this show.  He plays an almost perfect ruthless Wall Street businessman, and his monologue toward the end rationalizes it all with a chillingly accurate portrayal of human nature.  This was one of the best stories of this genre I've seen.  Two thumbs up, big time.",1463616000,2,938,4.711656441717792

Excellent acting all around and taut direction allows the plot to unfold while conveying the complex emotions of many of the characters.

4677596,5,B005FITIGO,"Men in smart, dark suits act nervously in a hush as a procession of women enter the office. Redundancy is in hand, and we observe a clinical dispatch of bad news packages handed out by the women to selected employees. The human stain of culling has started, and things are going to get ugly. But there is a greater threat lurking in the background, and the secret of this will begin to unfold - from the office trading floor to the top man in the boardroom. The message is clear the stock market is about to crash. Traders get twitchy, and the cosy charm of personal wealth is lost in an exchange of crisp dialogue. We are about to learn a lesson in the language of profit and loss: The traders have overstretched themselves, and the promise of high returns won't be fed back to stimulate the market: The public has gone broke.  .......Behind the seemly world of polite manners, smart suits and cocktails, lies a seething energy of ruthlessness: The film is set in the world of trading -and a great story too that enhances itself to the screen. The film engages energy and invites the viewer to observe a private and exclusive world. But it is like an artificial world born out of science fiction, which will soon crack open to reality: The traders are reminded that they are only one step away from becoming broke themselves ......The film has a subtle way to soft pedal emotions and politeness in a  controlled manner  it is like a mafia shake-up without the blood. .......There are lovely touches to the film  the music score ( by Nathan Larson ) beats along pleasantly  and there a snippet of a Chopin prelude ( no. 15 in D flat major ) that is cut short in play as Kevin Spacey awakes from sleep as we are about to indulge....and  a trader recalled to office from a plush bar, still drinking from a lengthy bottle hidden in a brown, paper bag.  I loved the ending: masterfully and touchingly real  - - -  the directors first venture into feature film  remarkable, and well done J.C.Chandor!  The acting is also rewarding on all levels, especially with the star graded choice of actors - and more. ....The story loosely reminds me of  The Machine Stops ( by E.M. Forster ); We ( by Yevgeny Zamyatin), and the film, The Swimmer ( starring Burt Lancaster ). Treat the film with a sense of black humour as it teases us to do so in return  and don't sell your soul to the night of the film.....

4677656,2,B005FITIGO,"This film is similar to the 2016 megahit ""The Big Short"" in that it explores the most public item of the 2008 economic catastrophe -- Wall Street's trading bundles of bad mortgages and the way it helped sink the economy. The difference between the films is ""The Big Short"" explores the issue from the outside and ""Margin Call"" perceives from the position inside a Wall Street trading place, not externally. That similarity aside, there isn't much the two films have in common. The newer film is exciting, funny, socially conscious and exceedingly watchable. ""Margin Call"" is boring, far too technical, and not very entertaining.

It's a shame this is the case for a good cast isn't used very well here. The script is the main thing to blame. Even in the scene where Jeremy Irons tells an employee to explain to him ""as if I am a child"" what's going on (the firm holds too many assets in sinking securities made up of mortgage bundles) the guy doing the explaining is still too technical. I think it must be clear this film was made with the assistance of Wall Street types and there wasn't anyone involved in the production that tried to tame the script, or even enliven it.

As it is, ""Margin Call"" is a couple hours of angst and greed from a Wall Street trader that dumped a lot of bad stuff on Americans. This is one episode that made up the 2008 economic collapse and, in that regard, the film is successful at presenting it. However, movies are also about entertainment and this one fails there. Watch ""The Big Short"" instead.",1460160000,,1531,4.583941605839416
4677657,5,B005FITIGO,"Extraordinary. It moves you slowly into the strange world of investment banking, and unheard of terms (let alone understood) like Credit Default Swap and CDO. But it's so fascinating you want to know about this secret world, which can impact all our lives. I kept waiting for someone to get shot or pushed down an empty elevator shaft, and it was refreshing there was none of that nonsense. Just solid writing.

It moves very slowly, which makes the suspense even more intense. There's lots of symbolism: the death of the beloved labrador dog of one of the bosses, the cleaning woman in the elevator, representing all the little people, standing passively between two of the top traders as they openly exchange info with each other because they know she won't have a clue to what they're discussing. Oh,  and the conversation between Will and his recently-fired boss Eric is brilliant.

Fantastic cast! Kevin Spacey, Demi Moore, Jeremy Irons, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, Simon Baker, Stanley Tucci, etc. are so right on. I wrote down all the things I didn't understand, so I would educate myself and understand them the next time I watched it. And the second time really was better, because I had a good idea of what was really happening out there. It's kind of a morality play; unlike Too Big to Fail, a good movie which was more historically factual but with less insight, the cast struggles through uncomfortable conundrums and  personal motives.

Anyone interested in Wall Street and what's going on behind those protected doors should love this movie, but one caveat: I've never seen a movie that squeezed so  many f bombs into two hours. Holy cow, is that how they really talk?",1459728000,8,1685,4.833333333333333

Nonetheless, the movie rang true to my understanding of the events of 2007-8. The movie focuses on a narrow slice of the situation, that is, how it affected one firm. However. the character studies that make this movie so interesting can be broadened to a view of the typical approach on Wall Street. This is what makes this movie powerful and important. What is missing here (and also in The Big Short) is how the federal government's policies (low interest rates and the community Reinvestment Act) made the crash inevitable. Overall, this movie will add to your understanding of how and why people get sucked into doing what they did. The casting is good, the acting is excellent, and the directing and dialog are also good.

4677813,3,B005FITIGO,"Not the best business movie and doesn't do a good job explaining the problem that led to the financial crisis (so for someone who doesn't know what caused it, I think they'd be totally lost throughout the movie).  I'm never sure if I should be routing for these financial criminals to succeed in their attempt to not lose a lot of money, or not.  I saw this after I saw the Big Short which is based on real people and does a better job explaining what happened and the characters were more enjoyable to watch. I always like Kevin Spacey, he does a believable job.  Some characters are pretty useless and undeveloped.  I watched it while waiting a long time for someone getting a medical procedure, so it was good enough to help pass the time if you are into business movies, which I am, but I won't be telling anyone else that they must see it.",1456963200,,844,4.356687898089172

Most importantly, it clearly shows what made all the characters what they are, despite any superficial qualms they might suffer for what they do. To a person, they really love big money.

The cover bills it as ""the best Wall Street movie ever made,"" and this is probably an exaggeration.  It is maybe the most realistic movie about the events leading up to the stock market collapse of 2008.

Simply put, if you want a crash course in how market sentiment can affect the securities industry, you'll enjoy it, but you need to approach it with the mindset that it will be dry, technical in nature, and leave you feeling unresolved.",1456790400,,655,4.873873873873874

  this movie was very good, but the idea behind all of the stuff that goes on in the buying and selling is very irritating.  the results or victims are the ones that get the shaft in the end.  the top does not care what happens to the middle or below.  that is usually the way of the world, but somehow, it has to stop... makes you want to certainly diversify your investments, so no one thing will kill the future. some people will like this movie, but others will just get angry at what takes place.  if you make a mistake, own up to it and take a loss.  the middle should not suffer at the whims of the top.  the movie was great, but the actions of the board makes you want to puke.",1456617600,2,692,4.036764705882353

Situational ethics abounds in many of the fiscal decisions made which causes the viewer to soul search what they would do.

Paul Bettany is good at portraying ""caring detachment"", if there is such a thing. I saw him in ""Mortdecai"" with Johnny Depp right after this. Talk about a 180!

4678444,5,B005FITIGO,"Jeremy Irons' speech at the end of the movie about how it has always been the same... every peak and every crash... is a classic bit of cinema: by the lack of control of government today, complete joke of regulation of Wall Street and the banks...  through the lack of any consequences to the 2008 massive world fraud involving 10s of trillions where very very few went to jail and the people of the USA and the world took it in the groin... for the same group of amoral trading houses that in the same and new names have controlled the world, its wars  and supposed reasons for wars and have suppressed if needed, the very creativity of humanity for their gain and for their privilege... who have plagued the world for hundreds of years... that speech, well written and without emotion delivered calmly over breakfast... is memorable for a certain clarity and truth and raw power if really heard properly.

The 2008 crash formalized the complete subservience of all other social entities to the trading houses and to the FED and largest banks... no more can we as a people pretend we don't know the truth or that we are in control of our country.
Elections are drivel, raw power and will seem to be enough for Americans, the West and the world.

The movie has a tone that is somber and yet brilliant...  because it really is a burial song of human pretenses to dignity or even the aspiration to be better.

Sad and yet a work of art in its own way, Margin Call taken as an artistic statement about a very ugly truth, is a tremendous movie.

A little remembered fact... since the crash of 2008, the FED (""private"") achieved control over federal government regulatory agencies, in effect regulating itself and its friends... ... in Central banking and by that controls the world and whom... the world now listens to in hushed tones of a slave master.

The few films about 911 (don't look close and run from the truth!) and the movies about the 2008 crash and bailout are bookends and the war movies in between, propaganda commentary.

Margin Call is about the futility of change without a system of morality, to my ear anyway,  that if the model of evolutionary pressure is the only thing that the human race can now beleive in beyond our pathetic patterns of need and consumption... then our headlong charge towards a planet of robots now ringing from every news source almost... is our deserved fate.

We can not say that Hollywood has not made movies that inferred what really happened on 911 and many anti war movies as well as raw war propaganda of course... and many movies about the Crash of 2008. It is us that are not able apparently to even protest.",1456272000,4,2658,4.563025210084033

4678482,4,B005FITIGO,"understated but riveting film which aptly depicts the market meltdown in mortgage-backed securities, although on a more compressed timeline.  the protagonist firm in the movie is probably based on Goldman Sachs which is usually the smartest guy in the room and would figure out the end is near before the rest of the crowd and get out of town alive.  (actually- not entirely true since they should have blown up with their AIG position but were made whole by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson - a former head of GS....).  Good acting all the way around- having worked in the business i particularly found most of the key characters very believable- particularly Paul Bettany, Simon Baker and Demi Moore.  They layoff scenes - how detached and disconnected the room becomes - very, very believable.

I was waiting to get more information and story line that explained the relationship of characters-Jared Cohen (Simon Baker), Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore);and Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci).

On its last day on Prime a day I was already inside for R and R. I had it on all day. It is smart, relevant to those of us who work/ed in corporate jobs at all levels without any porn sex or violence. It just doesn't ring true, however, that when Tuld fires Robertson, Robertson doesn't bring up something about sexism. Most women who are in top positions these days would. Also it is unrealistic that she would just be sitting in her office on her phone. Most  corp. execs in her position of having warned their bosses about a calamity they might be fired for would be downloading files.

All in all, the characters don't develop enough for you to care about them. Some are portrayed as sharks, but you don't see their ""sharky"" side. Some are portrayed as victims of the system. The moral questions don't develop because their is not enough talk about the consequences of their actions, so unless you know the history of the financial meltdown, it is a pretty shallow movie.",1455840000,,525,4.717391304347826

This film, with an excellent cast, by the way, failed that task, A more recent movie, ""The Big Short"" covered the same type of material and helped the audience understand what was going in. This was Wall Street during the mortgage crisis, a difficult thing to understand at best. All one could gather from Margin Call is that some big shots on Wall Street were doing things that would ultimately hurt thousands or even millions of people, and they did not particularly care. Conscience was in short supply, greed and avarice were not. Best single word for this : meh.",1455667200,,639,4.663716814159292
4678665,5,B005FITIGO,"In this age of over the top special effects and shallow acting, my favorite movie find is a low key movie that watches like a really good book reads. The characters and plot develop and the movie leaves you time to understand the players and the plot. I was not disappointed in Margin Call. I grew so enthralled in the unfolding of it that I couldn't bring myself to pause it and ended up stumbling about the house with my tablet. I am appreciative of the nuanced acting. This movie is not a docudrama. It is a fictional telling of a real event, the market meltdown of 2008. It does not identify itself directly with that, it represents the events that led to the first domino falling in the crisis and the story behind some characters who may have collectively flicked it. There is no good or bad, or evil for that matter. There was only greed, over-optimism, and very bad math. I began the movie ready to revile these people and ended it feeling empathy, for I would have taken the money as well. Great movie and I thank those who brought to the screen.

The movie is garnished with social relevance. However, I don't like an open- ended movie where I must make an analytical guess or make my own conclusion.

The plot line is at least loosely based on real events from the 2008 subprime lending crisis, and how people profited obscenely from the misfortunes of others.

Further, Demi Moore doesn't get a lot of screen time, but that's probably because she does such a good job with the time she does get that any more would have distracted from the main storyline.  That leads to the other great element of this movie, which is its portrayal of what is often the nature of business when huge sums of money are at stake:  We're all in it together when times are good, but the moment times become bad it could well be every man for himself, and don't expect anyone to tell you when that moment arrives.",1455408000,,644,4.394957983193278

A magical excel spreadsheet that someone ""solved"" with the result that the company was trading beyond their VAR limits, which then meant they were risking a trading loss as large as their market capitalization (completely irrelevant as far as solvency goes)?  WTF?  Would it have been so hard to have someone with the slightest idea what actually happened in 2008 review the script?  Lehman -- with the CEO named Tuld a pretty silly way to make him Lehmans's Fuld -- went bust because their assets were worthless and everyone knew they were worthless and they were marking them too high.  No one was going to buy that garbage in the completely fantastical ""fire sale"" that happened in this movie at prices starting at 95 cents on the dollar.  No one needed a magical spreadsheet to understand what was going on, they just had to get a list of Lehman's assets and mark them.",1455062400,,1044,4.610810810810811

I think there may have been too much implied, and not said, which would've perhaps let more people understand what was going on. And I feel the last part of the film kind of just glossed over a lot, after the first 3/4s moving so slowly. When it ended I felt very unsatisfied, like it had just lightly skimmed the surface. I think a little more dialogue, and not as much standing around, would have added to it.... You also couldn't really get very deep into any of the characters, even the positions in the company some held, was quite vague...

4679615,3,B005FITIGO,"To reviewers saying the movie is predictable, well, of course it is. It's based on history. Would you call a movie about WWII ""predictable""? To reviewers saying the ending didn't explain anything, it didn't need to. We all know what happened after that. That grave was being dug for everybody. This movie is a drama, not a thriller, but it does help to explain how any crisis has to start somewhere. We are shown ground zero, but individuals without any financial knowledge (such as me) may still not fully understand the details of what went down.

I moved to another state in May 2007 and lived there until January 2009. I couldn't find a decent-paying job and alternated between blaming myself for picking a bad place to live and blaming myself for being a general failure. It took several years before I fully realized what had been going on during that period. I just did some more research and looked at the TED spread for 2006 to 2009, and boy, my timing for that move (and for hauling @$$) was UNCANNY.

4679700,4,B005FITIGO,"Had never heard of this movie, and stumbled across it looking for something available for free streaming on Amazon Prime. It captured my interest in the first 2 minutes and held it firmly til the end. There are a few parallels with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, but this film is more focused on the (ruthless) behavior of an individual corporation and it senior management. I found the characters more interesting than the plot, which was not particularly complicated or creative, but nonetheless engaging. Jeremy Irons is superbly malevolent as the CEO, Kevin Spacey is good as the morally conflicted member of senior management.  One problem I had is that there are many characters, but time didn't allow for their development. And, some of the main characters don't really attract interest, e.g. the Zachary Quinto character (Peter Sullivan) and the Demi Moore character (Sarah Robertson), who have a lot of screen time but are rather bland. Simon Baker, however, plays a poster child character for that group of 40-somethings that seem to permeate  corporate America, offering little to their organizations beyond malignant personal ambition and Machiavellian maneuvering skills.

There were few, if any, heroes; these people were not particularly likable...ANY of them. That said, the story is quite compelling; I vividly remember the panic attack the entire stock market endured, as well as the anxiety that we, the little people lived, watching so much of our savings simply becoming worth-less because of the avarice and manipulation perpetrated on ""we the people.""

the premise is a fictitious financial firm realizing how many toxic assets they have on their balance sheet and what to do about it. All in all a good story and quite vicious in how people are treated on Wall St.: Very little sympathy or compassion shown to or about one another and none shown to common person, demonstrated most explicitly in the minor character of Seth who keeps wondering aloud how much each executive makes while being told how many people will lose their jobs because of the coming crisis.

4680357,5,B005FITIGO,"Despite a tough story to get across to viewers, Margin Call succeeds brilliantly.  This is largely due to a tight script and superb cast even though the story rarely leaves the sterile confines of a high-rise and some cars over a 24 hour period.  Paul Bettany, Zach Quinto, and Stanley Tucci along with Demi Moore perform their supporting roles with aplomb but the real prizes go to Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons who are nothing short of brilliant as morally compromised yet very human characters responding to incentives they know to be wrong but inconvenient to their personal wealth and career prospects.  This is a thinking persons film through and through, something all too rare these days.

If you want to know how the early stages of the Great Crash of 2008 happened, this story is pretty damn close to what the internal dynamics and incentives were like at the big investment banks on Wall Street like Goldman Sachs circa mid-2007 (which largely avoided the worst effects due to being first to dump and then short the MBS bonds and other derivatives it had once sold) versus Lehman Brothers (which didn't dump its assets quick enough and went bankrupt setting off the acute phase of the credit crunch and job losses).  Even if the details of the crisis and technical-speak are lost on you (and they really don't dominate at all, merely being plot devices for the onslaught of Nemesis upon the guilty characters), seeing the way past decisions undermine loyalty, responsibility and empathy is just spot on. The politics of a massive publicly owned corporation and its intricately operating hierarchy are something everyone who has worked in finance or another Fortune 500 company will find chillingly laid bare in a subtle way. There are no cartoonishly evil characters here, and even though Jeremy Irons' scenes make him out to be amoral he merely thinks that is the system they all signed on to, and he's somewhat right despite his callousness.  Spacey tries to hold the high ground when asked to essentially backstab all his employees, colleagues in other firms and life's work but in the end gives in to the one law of the jungle on the Street: money.  And while it's easy judge him as unscrupulous and unprincipled in that moment, the viewer should not forget another brilliant line delivered by Bettany earlier in the film defending the investment firms' actions:  you and I are guilty too, as without these amoral creatures and their great corporate vehicles, we wouldn't enjoy our lifestyles as we know them.  You shouldn't leave this film smugly confident that you aren't above these characters and they world they portray, even if in a more abstract, quotidian fashion.",1453248000,52,2687,4.900881057268722

4680408,5,B005FITIGO,"The Fractional-Banking/Fiat-Money system intentionally produces discord and distress.
F-banking/F-money does not produce Cooperation.

This movie tells you about something hidden. The character played by Jeremy Irons understood that he was servicing hidden players at the apex of the banking industry (Bank Of International Settlements  BIS, etc) who intentionally wanted to produce the [the crisis of asset-backed securities subprime mortgage lending] bubble and the ensuing crash.

When emotional distress is produced, the appetite for debt of peoples of whole nations increases significant. As the character Irons plays says at the end, there will be a whole lot of money to be made after this. (think of the money printing of Economic Easing that the Federal Reserve did and how much money got made in fees by Wall Street as a result, etc.)

Producing emotional discord and distress promotes the survival of the F-banking/F-money system until it doesnt anymore, because it becomes unsustainable (insolvent), as they all have, repeatedly throughout history, over a general period of some 250 years as their longevity cycle. All the worlds money systems tended to start as asset-backed or value-baked currencies, and then became debased. Usually the metal (gold or silver) used to mint the coinage became diluted (debased) with other alloy components that were cheap to mine. Originally the US Dollar was gold backed. Long ago that stopped being true (when the Federal Reserve system of fractional banking and fiat money took over).

During the War of Independence (our Revolutionary War), England had observes present, as did Germany. They didn't much care who won. The bankerss lawers of the City Of London didn't care who won.
(Crown Temple https://www.google.com/search?q=Crown+Temple )

The employers of the observers were interested in how best proceed to get leverage on the debt accrued by the war. It is the Admiralty Law (by which banking functions) that controls how ownership of debt is parsed out. The details of Admiralty Law parses out the ownership of each nations slaves (citizens) who are the debtors of last resort; since they are the ones who pay back the losses that are accrued by their governments and nations. This really means that debt (debt-money of the F-banking/F-money system) is the means by which the citizens of nations are turned into SLAVES. These slaves don't even know that they are the milk-cows for those who are seeking power to assuage their fear of inadequacy and death seeking power to survive. These people are those whose illusion driven contracts require them to do the job assignment of making slaves of those around the world who are open to being slaves. Dictatorships and Democracies all find a way to make slaves of those who are open to the idea of being sold their position of being slaves.

The Civil War was orchestrated early on by the City of London. They did this by getting the territories to want to be either Slave States or Free States. It was orchestrated by those same London City bankster/lawyers from the Crown Temple on behalf of the hidden money owners often referred to as the 13 Families or the Rothschild-cabal, etc. Insightful research details how the First World War was an orchestrated by money manipulation from a hidden perch to better control resources. The Second World War was again a power game, but the hidden part was that Japan was to steal the gold bullion of Indonesia and China. Japan was to do this for the emerging hidden power represented through the Federal Reserve of America. Todays support of the military-industrial-complex that President Eisenhower warned about can be seen with never ending war. Hidden promotion of the Islamic dynamic of today serves this profiteering process. (the tools of the hidden power driving this survival trip could, among others, be identified as the CIA, Zionist-Israel, City Of London, and others) Likewise, driving countries to debt allows the Internationally Monetary Fund (IMF) the chance to then ride to the rescue and provide insolvency relief by selling off a nations assets to private investors (the hidden players), and the plunder and slavery cycle is concluded; until the next scene can arrive to the play. Regime change and other sundry hostilities all work for the hidden power players, too, as your imagination my conclude.

The Board Of Directors (the share holders of the company headed by the character of Jeremy Irons)0 were all wealthy puppets of the hidden power structure behind the whole thing. The system sees and knows what Must happen. It waits until the seeds it plants become ripe to harvest. The character of Irons knew this, as did the well paid wealthy peons who were the company shareholders. All are slaves to their fear of survival.

INTERESTINGLY, the IMF did a global inventory of assets for all the globes nations. It was looking to discover what wealth assets could be fairly assigned to each of the worlds nations (available for pillaging when ripe). It turns out that (per population size) all nations have an equitable share of assets, as compared to all other nations. This means that each nation has an equitable amount of wealth, native to its territory. Each nations wealth status is equitable (per population size) to all other nations. It is not one-to-one equality, but it is close enough to be an equitable dynamic wherein something wonderful is possible. [the IMF doesnt tell anyone about this because it is in the business of plunder and stealing]

A global currency system that is based on the assets or the value of each nation winds up diving forward Cooperation between nations and peoples instead of fomenting Distress and war.

Having an Asset-Backed or Value-Backed money system for the globe makes war unprofitable.
Nations that have currencies that CANNOT be used as fiat-money cant easily fund war and conquest. Besides that is a pain in the butt as compared to the easy wealth growing that can be got through Cooperation.

The good husbandry of cooperation turns out to be the easiest way for all nations to increase their own wealth. People of each nation find it is easiest to increase their own wealth by using their nations assets or value in the best ways possible. Smart and savvy decision making happens, both at the micro level doing business for citizens, and at the macro level of national political decision making. Causing for war and other emotional distress dynamics becomes a stupid thing to do.

This film tells the story of the hidden authors of global distress and planned orchestration leading to the plunder of peoples sovereignty and nations assets as well. And all of this simply because the illusion is afraid for its survival.

4680443,3,B005FITIGO,"Not sure what the point of this movie was...was it a hypothetical musing of the beginning of the crash?  what was conjecture and what was truth?  For me, it didn't do enough to situate the action in a context of what was going on at that time--it presumes the viewer has an intimate knowledge of the time, and that presumption gets more iffy as time goes by and that turbulent time fades into the background.  If you have an interest in entertaining a view of how the 2007-2008 crash happened, maybe this will make sense to you.  If you didn't follow it too closely at the time, you will probably not understand the relevance of the action to any particular outcome.  Not sure also why it was important to portray the number crunchers as engineers by education, who ended up in Wall Street investment banks because they could make more money, as some sort of good guy outliers--nobody in the firms they worked with seemed to know they were engineers or could understand the models/projections they were creating.",1453075200,,1012,4.662921348314606

Having lived through a personal bankruptcy as a direct result of the stock market crash of 2008, I found this movie morbidly fascinating. It takes place in the offices of a huge investment banking company that was making money from packaging paper, the garbage mortgages that the government had forced the mortgage business to undertake, and selling those packages to other financial institution. Risky business would be an understatement as far as their operation was concerned. The entire drama spans about 12 hours of a day that will live in infamy. One might think that a financial drama would be like watching paint dry, but this one is totally engaging, well written and well acted.

The blue language was so egregious and ubiquitous that, for me at least, it completely overshadowed content.  Profanity certainly has a place in books or movies.  Used sparingly and strategically it spices hugely.  Remember, way back for example when old Rhett responded to tearful Scarlett that Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.  Damn!  Back in the day, that shocked.  And everybody loved it.  In contrast, Margin Call characters used the word f_ _ k or f _ _ king in almost every sentence.  It smacked of teenagers that just learned a new naughty word.  It became boring. It also made the movie less credible.  Gentlemen in high-powered positions simply do not use that type of language.

4680559,4,B005FITIGO,"Margin Call is a financial drama from 2011 that actually does a very good job of explaining the basics of the financial meltdown of 2008, as seen through the eyes of a fictional Wall Street investment bank.

Margin Call features an impressive cast that includes Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, Stanley Tucci, Demi Moore, Jeremy Irons, and Simon Baker. Its directed and written by J.C. Chandor, who was formerly a Wall Street investment banker. This probably accounts for much of the realism of the film.

As the movie opens, a massive layoff is underway at an unnamed fictional Wall Street investment bank. One casualty of the downsizing is Eric Dale (Tucci), one of the companys senior risk managers. His termination is so abrupt that hes not even permitted to pass on information about a project hes working, a project he thinks could be critical to the companys financial stability.

As hes being escorted from the building, he hands a thumb drive with the project data on it to Peter Sullivan (Quinto), one of his risk analysts, telling him to look at it but be careful.  Sullivan does this, and soon discovers that the company is so heavily leveraged by its investments in sub-prime mortgages that the amount of debt from the accounts on their floor alone exceeds the value of the entire company.

Sullivan naturally reports this to his superiors, Will Emerson (Bettany) and Sam Rogers (Spacey).  Thus begins a chain reaction of decisions by the companys higher-ups that eventually lead to the collapse of the financial markets, and ultimately the worldwide Great Recession

Ive watched Margin Call a few times now, and never fail to be impressed by its high production values, the superbly realistic acting from a wonderful ensemble cast, and a taut, well thought-out screenplay. I like the way the writers explain the beginnings of the financial crisis. Its completely non-political, focusing instead on the inner workings of one company. Its simple and easy to understand without being simplistic, and yet with just enough of the technical aspects included to make it feel realistic.

Overall, a very enjoyable and informative viewing experience. Recommended.",1452124800,4,2179,5.084033613445378

4680584,4,B005FITIGO,"In spite of the all-star cast and the gravity of the situation that essentially kicked off the meltdown of Wall Street, I didn't find the plot all that engaging. Most of the characters were ruthlessly cold-hearted and without scruples, except for a a few, and even those didn't really try to stop the action that was going to destroy companies and ruin careers throughout the industry. The story has been told before - banks and trading firms packaged together high risk mortgages and resold them as commodities.

When a senior level risk analyst, played by Stanley Tucci, was laid off, he passed the word to a junior colleague to review the analysis and ""be careful"". The brilliant junior analyst uncovered the disturbing news that the company was already too far into the risk territory and had been for weeks. The shortfall, trillions of dollars, was more than enough to sink the company. ""The party was over"", and the senior management concluded that they needed to completely sell off their position immediately during the next trading day. A few directors questioned the wisdom of doing so since it would do so much damage to the markets and to a lot of individuals. The entire narrative takes place on 2 days. The final scene with the company's CEO calmly enjoying a meal in his windowed office high over NYC is chilling because of his cold-hearted certainty that he could do no wrong. (There are no plot spoilers here because everyone already knows essentially what happened on those memorable days in late 2008.)

I felt that there were too many long stretches of people looking worried and introspective, and too little real action - it's all talk, talk, talk. And yet all of the talk doesn't do much to illuminate what the real problem was. In spite of the all-star cast, this movie didn't live up to its full potential. I'm not sure they ever even used the phrase ""margin call"". Nevertheless, it does provide another perspective on those historic days in 2008, which will continue to be the subject for scrutiny by financial and social historians.",1444608000,,2059,4.813559322033898

4680594,5,B005FITIGO,"Very happy I finally got around to watching this..!.  Margin Call is a very gripping drama that tells the story of a NYC financial firm that discovers major flaws in its financial make-up, which could lead to the company's demise. And/or could lead to the financial demise of its client-base.  This then lends to the company's executives frantically (but also rationally, in a matter of speaking) engaging in how to deal with the consequences, including dealing with questions of morality (or lack of it) of the potential ""band-aid"" solutions to the problem.  I think the movie attempts to portray in a microcosm (i.e. within one fictional firm) some of the representative problems that led to our 2008 financial fall....but M.C. is not concerned with technical financial jargon!  Anyone who enjoys great drama, great acting, and an intense storyline can enjoy this movie!

That said, this movie likely will be enjoyed if you enjoy movies heavy on good dialogue...  In some ways it strikes me as a similar to a 1990 movie, Glengary Glenn Ross (which coincidentally also had Kevin Spacey).  I think if you enjoyed ""GG-GR"" you should enjoy this...  Both movies have lots of dark ""sub-text"" between characters....all of the characters are basically fighting for their survival, at least career-wise and financially speaking.  ""M.C."" does a great job of conveying how high those stakes can be and how they can feel like a matter of life or death, or maybe even bigger!!

All-in-all great ensemble cast performances.  Zach Quinto is engaging as the quasi-protagonist.  The great Jeremy Iron's performance in particular stood out for me!  Irons plays a refined, polished executive on the one hand...and yet his character taps into very dark (almost primal) fighting instincts.

4680604,1,B005FITIGO,"For every reviewer using the word ""rivet"" or ""riveting,"" I strongly urge you take a glance at those definitions again. There wasn't a thing about this movie that kept my butt riveted to my seat nor my eyes riveted to the screen. It was 100% the fact that I spent $2.99 that made me watch it until the end.

If you're going off of the trailer, it really looks interesting. The trailer suggested action, suspense, even a little mystery. And seriously, how can a movie possibly go wrong with such a strong, veteran cast? I admit, that's how they got me! I am not a wall street analyst but I do enjoy watching films and documentaries about it. I've watched everything from Too Big To Fail (feature film) to Hank (documentary). Coming from that perspective, this movie really is BORING, SLOW, and anti-climatic. Slow because you don't begin to get to the point of the movie until after the halfway point. Boring because the film spends almost the entire time 'telling' you what's happening rather than 'showing' you what's happening. You could get more entertainment from reading a book! A book won't tell me the sky is falling (aka financial crisis), but it will describe what the scene looks and feels like so I can experience it for myself.

I made in 40 minutes into the film without having a clear understanding of what the problem in the company was. I couldn't tell you a thing about any of the characters, except that person's name and position in the company. I didn't know why the risk manager was fired but his underlings remained; I didn't know why he was being escorted out of the building by the doorman (However, it was clear WHY the doorman allowed the risk manager to give his underling the flash drive--because he was a doorman and not security); I didn't know why that fired guy was so mad at Demi Moore's character; Hell, I barely get why her character was even included when she had all of 9 or 10 lines that didn't significantly contribute to the plot. Who cares that you're gonna be the fall guy if I never see the ""fall"" happen?

Somewhere around an hour into the thing, Kevin Spacey's character is called into the office to ""take a look"" at the problem. Do we get to see what the problem is? Of course not! We are supposed to gather from the incessant ""f**k"" and similar curse words that there is a problem. And, when one person's cursing doesn't drive home the point, we'll just get that person's boss to come in and curse some more...then stare out of a window and curse some more. Come on! Many of the 5-star reviewers claim that folks who found the movie boring because it lacked action scenes. To be clear, there was no need to have a building blown up, have a high-speed car chase, or have someone break out in a bar fight. I think the viewing public is mature enough to watch and be entertained by a piece that lacks these features. What we do require, though, is a plausible plot to follow, some interesting (and dare I say, witty) dialogue, and an ending that leaves us satisfied...even if you don't live up to the hype of your trailer. Since, most of us lived through the meltdown we are fully aware of how the real story ended, please understand that no one was expecting the film to end with money growing on trees. Unfortunately, that magnificent buildup from the trailer ends with a guy, who contributed to the meltdown, being stuck in a job he doesn't like and burying his dog in what used to be his yard. Symbolism received but guess what...I don't know enough about the guy to care!",1439683200,11,3519,4.503912363067292

This movie is about the tense final hours leading up to the financial meltdown of 2008.  Kevin Spacey is very good as a team leader that wants to quit on principle,  but can't due to financial obligations.  He gives a rousing speech to a room full of financial analysts even as he also tells them they're about to lose jobs.  Jeremy Irons is brilliant as the Grand Poo Bah of the firm that gives understated threat through his teeth while dining on exquisite cuisine.  Ms. Moore's character is out for her cut.  Zachary Quinto is great at looking pained, and could be in an emo video.  Simon Baker shaves in the sink at the office and keeps the troops on edge.  Stanley Tucci is the man that warns the firm of the impending disaster.  But above all,  Paul Bettany gives a gut wrenching performance as a trader that is of two minds about his job, and on a philosophical ledge.",1437436800,,992,4.548022598870056

4680618,5,B005FITIGO,"A great movie that was made about the financial collapse is Margin Call. It has an ensemble cast the includes Kevin Spacey,Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons,Zachary Quinto,Simon Baker,Demi Moore and Stanley Tucci. This first film that is written and directed by J. C. Chandor takes place at an investment firm during the first few hours of the upcoming financial crisis back in 2008.

An entry-level financial analyst completed a work of a senior analyst Eric Dale,who was just laid off together with many others from a financial firm, found an information that found it necessary for the company to liquidate its resources. This leads to many decisions from the firm's higher ups to make decisions overnight as to do the necessary actions needed to stay afloat and to lay more people off from the company.

This is definitely one thought provoking film that realistically highlights the events that happened during the early hours of the financial crisis in 2008. It provides us an overview of how financial analysts and financial firms particularly the higher ups make decisions to stay afloat. Also,we get to see different characters with moral backgrounds as to how they deal with actions taken. Despite the fact that the film somehow ended abruptly and the lack of tension it provides as many of the events happen through the conversation of the characters,it nevertheless provides the viewer of a great movie about the impact of the meltdown on a company and the lives of the employees working.",1435881600,,1493,5.016129032258065

4680622,5,B005FITIGO,"The best 'fictionalized' movie depiction of the true chaos and criminal behavior of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, seen from within an investment bank that could very well just be called ""Lehman Brothers"".

As a banker who worked during the crisis (and knew all too well how rotten Lehman's books were, filled with garbage structured securities - admittedly every major investment bank had some level of mis-priced CMBS, CDO holdings - but Lehman was the worst of the bunch, followed closely by Citigroup) this movie does an excellent job of depicting how traders tried to dump these securities onto investors as the crisis was beginning.

Bankers 'financial engineering', creating and selling mortgage-backed securities -- whose true underlying value was never clearly understood by  most bankers in the first place and relied on the false premise that housing values always increase -- was one key cause of inflating the credit bubble, as the 'risk' of loan repayment was moved from lenders to investors but the movie does not get too deep into the causes of the crisis (for more on that I recommend the excellent, Academy-award winning documentary 'Inside Job')

In terms of showing the frantic nature of Wall St. once the cracks began to show however, the movie -largely- gets the facts and events correct. In addition to simply telling a largely true story, the movie itself is a riveting piece of drama with top-notch performances from its star-studded cast; Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker, Demi Moore and Jeremy Irons are all at the top of their game (Spacey deserved an Oscar nod for his work). Paul Bettany and Zachary Quinto add to these excellent ensemble acting.

During these interruptions we got to watch ten to fifteen second snippets of the movie interspersed with much loooooonger periods of watching the reload bar crawwwwwwwwwwwwwl across the screen.  I finally could take no more and turned the movie off for 90 minutes to wait for streaming traffic to become less crammed. Finally got to watch the film, but had to stay up late in order to get an ok signal. Also paid for the HD version, which under the circumstances constantly got downgraded to SD.

4680633,5,B005FITIGO,"Having watched Margin Call for the third time, I remain floored by how solid and accurate this movie is.  It truly captures the sociopathic behavior of the people who run the big Banks/Broker Dealers and how dysfunctional their professional and personal worlds are.  Unless money is on the line, that is.  Then they work together, stomping on anyone  including each other  to grab as much of the pie, deserved or not.  John Tuld (rhymes with Fuld anyone?)  how does the steak and wine in the Executive Dining Room taste after orchestrating a market sell-off that would cripple millions?  Sam Rogers  did you ever think to call your son even though he might be on the other side of those bad trades? Sarah Robertson, you just let your entire firm - and Wall Street - down because you're spineless and/or incompetent, so whats your focus?  Your severance package, of course.  Will Emerson you spent what, close to $75k last year on booze and hookers which did not even put a dent in your take home pay.  Having personally seen microcosms of this conduct first hand, there is a ton of TRUTH in these character portrayals.  The casting is superb.  The mood  most of the action is shot at night in a cloak of darkness  perfect.  Subject matter may be a bit deep for the Average Joe but, then again, the Average Joe would never be able to find himself anywhere near this type of activity (cause, you know, that $700,000 mortgage and $50,000 auto is so manageable on a $60,000 salary).

4680705,4,B005FITIGO,"No sex, no car chases, no bloodshed, lots of talking -- and yet this movie succeeds in gripping the viewer.  Its genius, I think, lies in showing us something that is quite familiar -- the anxiety that goes with losing one's job without having done anything to merit being fired -- and putting that familiar anxiety (or fear) in a context that most of us have no direct experience of: the world of high finance, hedge funds, collateralized debt obligations, etc. etc.  We like seeing people who are that high on the economic totem pole sweat, and yet because they are not all bad people, the movie enables us to see them as fellow human beings too -- in a tight spot of a kind that many of us can imagine ourselves being in, and not just at the mercy of ""the economy"" but as suffering the consequences of decisions made much higher up the chain of command than we can ever aspire to.  These decisions put the people in the movie in danger -- and yet we know too that when things were going well, these same people were all too happy to benefit from the short-term profitable results of these same decisions.  So our attitude towards them is sympathetic, but complicated, in a way that keeps us gripped.

The world of high finance engenders its particular moral dilemmas, and they too are engaging.  The firm in question, an investment bank, needs to unload a lot of questionable financial instruments (think of collateralized bad mortgage debt) that threaten in short order to undermine the total capitalization of the firm.  The ethical question is -- can and should the firm sell these off to clients who don't yet know that the firm's own projections show that the instruments will be worthless in a very short time?  AND if it starts to sell off huge tranches of them, how long ( matter of hours) will it take for the markets, and hence the clients, to cotton to to the shakiness of the firm, drive the prices down, and leave the firm, as they say, ""exposed"" -- and with its reputation for fair dealing in tatters?

These are the issues.  Thanks to a great cast, they're absorbingly presented.  Stanley Tucci (who is getting fired right at the opening), Kevin Spacey, and Demi Moore are  in different positions and at different ranks in the firm, and they want to do ""the right thing"" (or find a way to convince themselves that they can keep their integrity without ruining the firm).  Simon Baker is higher up the food chain, and Jeremy Irons is at the top -- and it's a bit harder to sympathize with them (I'm avoiding spoilers).  Good work too from Paul Bettany and Zachary Quinto.  J. C Chandor has written a smart, knowing script, and he directs with unflashy efficiency (his dad was fired from Merrill Lynch, we learn in one of the special features).  But the acting's the thing -- these guys bring it to life, creating distinct characters and keeping us engaged.  Well worth a look.",1415145600,,2893,4.564796905222437

It is part of what is undermining American democracy, now that government decisions as well as actual elections are being sold to the highest bidder. There ought to be a law, and there isn't.

4680732,3,B005FITIGO,"There was A LOT of drama in the unaccounted for and unpunished creation and the punishing (to everyone except the at-fault profiteers) aftermath of the Great Recession, which in this work was only scratched at the surface and viewed from too limited a perspective in the telling of it.

There was also, in the unavoidable, tactile plunder of the real event, a great deal of ugliness: the unbounded greed of the perpetrators, their arrogant, selfish ignorance and that of their aligned legislators, the latter not touched, the former rendered (mostly through the doubtful guilt written into Spacey's character) far too kindly.

The Great Recession is the story of a tilted system that went criminal and should have killed itself, but instead was left standing tall amidst the rubble of broken and uncertain futures for all of its blood-drawn, dream-torn victims, spilling out obscene profits to its gear turners, Italian and London tailored in Teflon-smug at the kangaroo appearances before culpable committees in Congress, laughing all the way to their banks, yachts, and multi-million-dollar homes.

It portrays the corrupting influence of money on the individual and shows just how easily these mega-conglomerates can convince their spelled to do their bidding. It doesn't do it in the usual Hollywood fashion, and that is why i found this movie so compelling.

Each character upon being introduced feels like a real person navigating the reality of working for a major investment company. It's really a good demonstration of minimalism in film, and how saying less actually tells us more.

This movie does not dumb down the financial jargon, and it doesn't need to. The characters play off one another as we make it up the chain of command at this company. Each character adds a distinct multidimensionality to the scene they are in and helps us feel like these people making enormous amounts of money are still human. If not them, then someone else.

4680743,5,B005FITIGO,"New York, a nameless financial firm, circa Fall of 2008. A woman in a business suit is hunting for someone in the offices of one of New York's high-rise office buildings. She's obviously a stranger since the other workers don't seem to recognize her, and she doesn't know what the person she seeks looks like. Finally, she finds him and asks him to accompany her into a private conference room. In the conference room she lowers the boom: the firm is letting him go. She's part of a hired agency who visits firms to lay off and/or fire workers instead of the firm having to do the dirty work themselves. They act as a cushion between the firm and the poor schmuck who's getting the ax.

During the meeting, he tells the representative that he's currently working on an important project, but the agent offers a generic reply that whatever he's working is no longer his concern, and the firm will take care of it. Of course, it's obvious she has no idea what she's talking about because she's from an outside firm simply engaged to lower the ax on unsuspecting office works. She really has nothing to do with the intricacies of the firm itself. After he's cleaned out his desk, he gives a flash-drive to one of his underlings who's still with the firm and says ""Just be careful."" Later Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), a traders manager, holds a meeting and breaks the news that 80% of the firm had been let go, but those who remain were the most successful, the survivors. At first everything is upbeat despite the lay-offs. This is the beginning of one of the best films of its type about the cut-throat world of financial firms on Wall Street, ""Margin Call"".

The man they let go, Eric Dale, was some kind of senior risk-management adviser, and he was working on the profit-income-risk of the company and realizing something was terribly wrong. He had given the flash-drive to one of the lower level risk-management advisers, Peter Sullivan, who looks through the data on the flash-drive and fills in the missing pieces. The firm is in huge financial trouble. He calls his co-worker Seth at a nearby bar/strip club, who informs his boss, Will Emerson (Paul Bettany, the Albino of the Da Vinci Code)that they need to return to the firm and see the data, even though by now it's 11:00pm. (We learn later that Emerson spends just under $70,000 a year on booze and broads.) And they need Eric Dale to return to the offices, even though they not only just fired him but they disconnected his company cell phone. Sullivan shows Rogers and Emerson the data, which demonstrates the company is more heavily in debt than its entire worth. In other words, the company owes more than what the company could be sold for on the open market.

Eventually, Chief Risk-Management Officer Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore) and Simon Baker (Jared Cohen), one of the top executives, are brought together with Rogers, Emerson, Sullivan, and Seth into a meeting on one of the top floors of the executive suites to discuss the nature of the problem. By 3:00am in the morning, the CEO of the entire firm flies in by helicopter. What is the nature of the problem and what is the short-term solution? Apparently, these after-midnight meetings were occurring at many New York financial firms on the eve of the crisis.

An outstanding completely character/drama-driven film. The cast is first rate. No real big ""stars"" but a cast of heavy hitters in acting. And a first-rate script, one of the best since David Mamet's ""Glen Garry Glen Ross"". While not an escapist film, the story demonstrates an insider's view of what was going on during the eve of the financial crisis.",1407456000,,3634,4.691222570532916

If you can set aside your ire about the despicable actions of the people who created the latest ""great depression"" this movie is an interesting look inside Wall Street/banks/bankers - the motivations, survival instincts and personalities of some believable, and representative, characters. The POV is not simplistic and the characters are not let off the hook for what they do or have done.  As usual, not all the right heads roll - which is realistic.  Bottom line is MONEY!  Even the characters who tried to rise above the greed of the top brass come out with lots of it.  I don't think viewers will side with these people, or like them, but watching them is fascinating.

I like the depiction of the crash of 2008, and the moral implications of the firm's handling of the impending losses on those repackaged bad mortgages made to idiots without enough money to pay for that 500k house. Don't want to spoil things but I think we all know how it turns out. The moral dimension is what made this interesting to me. They mostly chose to rip their colleagues off with a fire sale of worthless commodities in exchange for bonuses.

What was disturbing was the simplistic attack on capitalist practices, as if the bad old investors/brokers brought this mess down on everyone's heads. Congress, (mainly the Dems) pressured banks to offer mortgages to bad prospects. To turn this idiocy into something profitable, investors figured out how to repackage them to mitigate risk. Yes it was risky but the main fault lies with meddling of Congress in the free markets in the first place. So, Wall Street did bad things when the house of cards came down. But the villains are never named in the whole length of this movie.

For me the narrative of the movie is about how its principal players are concerned only by the prosperity of their corporation. There is no sense, or effort shown for the public good. In essence, the message here is that Corporations are amoral, and their existence owes its need to survive and succeed, at any cost. As the cast, play out their respective roles there is reflection, they reflect on the enormity of what is happening: For their company and their lives are being rendered meaningless. While the movie does not depict any one single financial event, or any one financial institution, however, there are `threads' that link this `fictional' account into the real world. This can be exemplified by the 2008 financial crisis: Goldman Sachs and the organisation's efforts to move early to reduce its position in mortgage-backed securities.

This story line was to follow the 2008 events in our markets with toxic assets.,1398988800,,279,4.365384615384615

4680773,5,B005FITIGO,"Maybe the best ""Wall Street"" movie ever made. The acting is superb, the characters extremely believable, and the script nails the subprime mortgage industry meltdown of 2007/2008 to a T. Margin call deals with a 36 hour period at a major Wall Street Firm (could be Citi, Lehman Bros, BS, JPM or a host of others) during which an employee just let go from the firm as a result of a ""downsizing"" had discovered a potential catostrophic drop in the firm's market cap as a result of the firm being over-leveraged in mortgage-backed securities--er--credit default swaps. The layed-off employee, played brilliantly by Stanley Tucci, hands a usb drive containing his findings to one of his underlings who was retained by the firm (Zachary Quinto) as he is being escorted from the building and cautions him to ""be careful"". The film takes off from there with Quinto's character Peter opening the files on the usb, discovering the impending catastrophe, and alerting the uphill chain of command. Anyone who has worked in corporate America (esp. in finance) will appreciate the stunning work of Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons. These characters are real, and exist in every nook and cranny in upper echelons of Fortune 500 companies.",1397520000,,1221,4.990196078431373

4680783,5,B005FITIGO,"This combo pack Blu-ray and DVD plays very well in Blu-ray players with 1080 P screens.  Due to the indoor scene locations and brief outdoor window views, the Blu-ray may not enhance the images to the average viewer over the standard DVD.

Due to the fact I am presently reading the book The Smartest Guys in The Room by McLean and Elkind, this film presented to me in a very different way, revealing the inner workings and thinking of the individuals facing this type dilemma.  The film provides a visual image of the similar process of securitization and what occurs when aggressive selling by originators is not maintained and monitored by higher-ups due to greed.  This entangling thriller with outstanding acting brings the viewer the closest to this human event.  These are some of our best actors in our time and they come through brilliantly.

The movie is in a New York City type setting using a big city backdrop to provide a financial industry effect.  The title may not be appreciated by the ordinary solo investor for margin call is a rare event that minimally impacts the small investor due to strict broker controls.  Here the event threatens 8 trillion dollars in bundled debt.  Powerful and shocking this movie provides the Enron reader a brief opening window of the companys unraveling and understanding of human mindset under those conditions.

The performances are excellent, and the story is especially relevant in view of the meltdown of 2008 and the fall of Lehman Brothers.  It isn't necessary to fully understand the financial issues behind the fictional firm's jeopardy in order to appreciate that Margin Call is the ""Wall Street"" of its time.  The screenplay was deservedly nominated for an Academy award.  An all-too-true, timely thriller that deserves to be seen.",1394496000,,500,4.9879518072289155
4680785,3,B005FITIGO,Not the best Wall Street movie as some have suggested..an unrealistic portrayal of the 2008 financial crisis. Too superficial...movie was microism of what really happened.,1394409600,,171,5.88
4680786,3,B005FITIGO,Funny how occasionally a movie slips by you. This is one of those movies. A strong cast including Kevin Spacey. I liked the pace of the movie and the intensity of the acting.

4680787,4,B005FITIGO,"I really liked Margin Call. Since I have no background at all in the subject matter, a lot of it went over my head, and a friend had to explain a lot of it to me. But it was still an enjoyable movie.",1394236800,,199,3.6511627906976742

4680792,3,B005FITIGO,"Watched ""Margin Call"" last night. It was good in that it was smart, well acted, and the actors had good chemistry. But it really just kind of lays there. It builds tension nicely, but at the same time, there are no real stakes, so the tension dissipates. Yes, it is based on a huge Wall Street scandal that ruined our economy for years to come, but for the characters involved? Nothing really comes across as vital.

Everyone is very matter of fact and drab about the looming crisis. Even when the company is on the brink of going under or when they are selling garbage to people they are knowingly ruining, it comes across as business as usual, which is kind of the point, but it just ends up seeming bland and unimportant. And the characters aren't very likeable, so we have no one to root for. Everyone is a sell-out or just an awful scum bag, so we have no point of reference for the audience and we never really care about anyone or their fate. Without the backdrop of recent history we wouldn't be able to tell just how truly slimy the characters are being. Again, that's kind of the point of the movie, but it really plays out poorly from a dramatic standpoint.

Symbolism hammers you over the head with no subtlety to the point where it is insulting. Meanwhile, the dialogue is so industry specific that most movie goers will have no idea what they are talking about, even if they go in to the movie knowing the entire event the film is based on. I know this is how the characters would really talk, but there is just so much ""business-ese"" that it becomes tiresome. Even the expository scenes that are meant to inform the audience of the situation in plain English rely so heavily on metaphor and tech-talk that it's just as bad as having no exposition at all.

This movie is well shot, well acted, and very smart, but it is more of a ""day at the office"" than a dramatic film. Can't say as I'd watch it again.",1393372800,,1918,4.382022471910112
4680793,5,B005FITIGO,It was a great movie.  Both my husband and I throughly enjoyed the movie.  I actually think that we're going to watch it a second time.,1393200000,,135,4.153846153846154
4680794,5,B005FITIGO,"This is another well written work by the same author as All is Lost.  I think his name is J. D. Chandor.  I may not have his name right but his work speaks for itself.

 I would recommend seeing this movie first and All is Lost as a sequel.
In this movie....we see how events and clinging to the material ....can destroy or bury the innate goodness in humankind.

 We can still see goodness -- more in the young who have not been so long in the waters of greed --  but we see the power that greed has to destroy human caring for one another.

I think I would want to see any work by this author.

4680798,2,B005FITIGO,Haunting music plays in the background throughout the entire movie.  The tension is just not there....it all feels very fictional.  Strange since it all really happened.  The movie just misses the mark.,1392249600,,202,5.25
4680799,4,B005FITIGO,"Fun to watch the machinations.  The intrigues (personal politics) in this film are reminiscent of those in the ""Suits,"" TV series.  There's even a pivotal super whiz-kid character (i.e., as in Suits).

Spacey does a good modern-day - if more weakly principled - Machiavelli (consider his also excellent job in the wonderfully cynical TV series of, basically, the same genre, ""House of Cards"").

Not all characters, however, are as well-defined as even the somewhat trite (older divorc&eacute;'s only love is his dog) and otherwise vaguely limned Spacey role.  Subordinates, then, are less interesting and most of their relationships seem contrived merely to flesh out the fairly flimsy premise which aims to - more suggestively than it actually does - mirror the venal predation and hucksterism of the Wall St. shenanigans that so recently sent the world economy into near free fall.

Stern Jeremy Irons somewhat overplays the severe coolness-under-fire of the subject trading house's top executive.  Then again, the whole thing's caricature.  Thus, the over-the-top character of roles and their enactment here is, at least, consistent as a fiction.  The film seems short, though, and neither characters nor story overstay their welcome.

No such conveniently trivializing excuse for their real-life counterparts, however.",1392249600,,1322,5.5
4680800,5,B005FITIGO,"I 100% loved this movie! It is slow and fast at the same time which may not make sense unless you have seen the movie. It takes place in a 24 hour time frame during the 2008 crash. I was interested to see how greedy investment banks can be and how they got in over their head. Much of the content is very dry being that it's mostly financials being discussed, so again unless you are interested in finance, economics or at least understand it then I wouldn't recommend this movie.",1392249600,,480,4.285714285714286

The recklessness, selfishness, and societal apathy involved with each of these characters is stunningly real - and worst yet these same types are still playing with the markets.

The most normal characters with a conscience appeared to be (a) the incomparable actor Kevin Spacey who was more attached to his chocolate Lab than his employees, and (b) a rocket-scientist-turned-stock analyst. However, acting was good, music wasn't too intrusive, and romance was minimal - so it's worth watching at least once.

4680883,5,B005FITIGO,"Full disclosure, I work in the industry, so there is a bias in my commentary but that's largely mitigated by the endorsement of authenticity I'd give this film.

The truth about 2006-2009, and all the gains, greed, loss and (ultimately) chaos that ensued on both Wall Street and Main Street, is that many of the beleaguered investment bankers, traders, portfolio managers, et al, were just as much victims as the ""little guy"" due to the decisions made by a select few the highest ranks of these organizations. In no uncertain terms, Atticus Finch is not a character in this film, and arguably, there are a few characters that would put Hannibal Lector or Darth Vader to shame. That said, there are a number of roles that by the end of the movie, you feel really bad for, and empathize with their loss.

The timing of the film's release (the peak of the Occupy Wall Street movement) ruined any chance it had for commercial success or being a serious contender for the awards season... cause who wants to feel bad for a bunch of rich finance guys... but make no mistake ... this is definitely a film worth watching.",1388620800,,1113,4.616161616161616

I was in the business for 30 years and what they were doing makes no sense.  In effect you have a great cast essentially speaking a foreign language for the camera.  Also, I don't get the dilemma here.  It certainly isn't moral.  One bunch of bankers/traders have essentially figured out that the market is going to crash a little bit before their competitors.  They don't have inside information.  And they might be wrong.  And, there is nothing wrong with liquidating.  The idea that they'll be pariahs afterwards is idiotic.  Any Firm, on any given day, might decide to do the same.  Big deal.  That's their prerogative.  All the supposed tension is internally driven..they think if they don't act immediately they will get a 'margin call'; but, they don't even have one yet.",1386547200,3,947,4.771604938271605
4680916,4,B005FITIGO,"The beginning chapters of the incredible collapse of the financial markets in the United States in 2007 and 2008 is a great choice for a film since it has the potential to humanize the great risks the large financial firms took as they purchased unsound mortgages, packaged them as securities, and sold them to their customer base. This film certainly humanizes this unsettling event in this countrys financial and economic history. However, as I watched the film I felt that the dialogue and actions of the actors may be beyond the comprehension of those who have little understanding of economics and finance or who did not pay much attention to the meltdown that was experienced in the final months of the George W Bush presidency and which stretched into the Obama presidency and required considerable funds to prop up the over-extended financial industry.

I think the film made a wise choice to focus on the downsizing and layoffs that occur during these financial emergencies rather than go too far in depth regarding hedge funds, derivatives, and banks that are too big to fail. Instead the focus was placed upon the characters in an un-named financial firm and the impact of the economic crisis on the lives of these people. Heads do roll in this film and it was fascinating to see who survives and who goes when the going gets tough.

Stanley Tucci plays an experienced risk manager whose economic model indicates there is considerable risk for the firm as it takes bundled unsafe mortgages and collateralizes them as securities. Since the process requires analysis of the risks of various bundles, the securities stay on the books for over 30 days, creating a considerable vulnerability should the market for these securities evaporate, which is exactly what happened in reality and in the film.

Zachary Quinto plays the role of a bright PhD physicist with a specialty in propulsion who fits the pieces together after Tucci is laid off. Quintos character demonstrates that the rewards on wall street are so much greater than academia that some of the brightest minds are attracted to the oversized rewards that Wall Street offer.

Demi Moore plays the role of a top executive in charge of risk management for the firm. It is ultimately her model that has been unable to predict that the firm is so over-committed to underwater mortgage-backed securities that the total potential loss exceeds the firm's total market capitalization value. She thinks that all those colleagues of hers in the top management tier will pay the price but her assumption proves wrong.

Paul Bettany, Kevin Spacey, Simon Baker, and Jeremy Irons are the four exceptional actors who play the four layers of management at the firm, all of whom have various motivations for their work and perspective on the financial crisis. Young Penn Badgley is a 24 year old making $250,000 a year at an entry level job who has become obsessed with the corporate structure and the ever increasing financial rewards in this business.

The financial crisis of 2007-2008 has much complexity but this film put one aspect of that crisis into human dimensions and thus is a very entertaining film.",1386374400,,3162,4.9453860640301315
4680917,4,B005FITIGO,"This is a really solid drama. I thought this was possibly going to be a sensationalized or over-the-top story about Wall Street excesses, but it really wasn't. There were some really well known names (such as Spacey and Moore) and some newer or perhaps lesser known names, but they all did very well in their roles, regardless of their background in Hollywood. What I particularly liked about the film was how it explored the brutal, bottom line aspects of the finance and securities business as well as the humanity of many of the characters (no matter how despicably some were portrayed). It definitely isn't a feelgood film, but it is a film that will make you think--and one that will likely entertain you.",1386374400,,710,4.780487804878049

Unfortunately, the excessive language in even the opening scenes really spoiled the movie for me.  I realize that won't affect everyone the same way, but if you don't enjoy listening to foul language, it does get in the way of enjoying the story.  This might work well with a TV Guardian or Clearplay filtering mechanism which allows one to watch the story without having to listen to the language.  The only drawback is if the language is so pervasive that the filtering devices crater the storyline connections.

It's been a few days since we watched it, but I think it had a bit of foul language, which I wish could be omitted.  We hadn't see ""Spock"" in anything else before - he did a good job.

With the exception of the one character played by Simon Baker, the characters are not crooks or cheats or predators, but people trying to make sense of the situation they find themselves in and maybe achieve some redemption. Hollywood used to make films like this with much greater frequency, exploring meaty issues and situations to maximum dramatic effect (think Stalag 17 or The Best Years of Our Lives or even Casablanca).  In other words, drama built around meaningful situations where the outcomes really matter. These are the kinds of situations that make movies memorable, and make people want to watch the movies again and again because they show us people not much different from us discovering the heroes within themselves.",1384041600,,1010,4.804597701149425

What's on the screen?
Elephants being slaughtered for ivory? The Facebook IPO? My 401k after Nacchio pummeled $250k out of it?
And could someone show me the formula-trade-fiasco details, so I can follow the worry?

More to follow, if I can return to this sinking ship.

4680972,3,B005FITIGO,Some very good acting in this flick but the movie moved along too s-l-o-w. You really don't know what the problem is until fairly along in the plot. It's discovered by an underling after receiving a flash drive from a co-worker who was just fired. You really don't know why he was fired except that the firm cleans house every so often. So the underling who was given this flash drive starts looking at its contents and calls his younger co-worker back to the office after hours to confirm what he finds. That's just it. You really don't know what he finds except that its really bad. Then the executives get called in and the remainder of the movie is about what course of action to take. It's really about making a choice. The movie was good but the ending was not. That's why I gave it three stars.,1382227200,,801,4.382550335570469
4680973,3,B005FITIGO,"The director has spun up an incredibly (if sadly) believable series of scenes. The very final scene pisses away all plausibility in a few seconds of runtime. I will not spoil the end here, except to say that an incredible coincidence comes out of nowhere. The creator clearly intends to make a poignant metaphor. Instead, it hits like a freshman short story writer with a baseball bat.

The remainder of the film is understated and tense. The first third could be called lagging. Someone has advised not to allow the slightest hint of financial explanation. The scenes in which the predicament is discussed by a growing number of executives feel false. There is some throwaway trader jargon intended to provide authenticity without boring people who do not follow markets. When CEO character finally appears, his job is to play Doctor Watson. ""Explain it to me as if I was a small child or a golden retriever."" Really? The CEO would deliver that stock line? The function could not have been performed by any number of junior traders that crowd the movie?

The Brooklyn Bridge crossing scene is the opposite. It reads authentically, carried by Paul Bettany.

All told, the movie held my attention. It avoided the excesses of 1987's Wall Street (The Gordon Gecko echo). I wanted it to be great. Who knows? Some re-editing, and extra footage might bring it up a notch. Regardless, they absolutely must bury that final scene.",1382140800,,1421,4.863636363636363

I like how they took bits of pieces of the big financial companies and played with fantasy too. One of the better free prime instant videos I have seen on Amazon. I recommend watching this if you would enjoy a well-written script about the world of finance. If you did not follow closely to the 2008 sub prime mortgage crisis- it may be helpful to briefly read about it online. Then, one can play the fun game to decipher which moves and pieces may have been their real-life counterparts. I would have enjoyed a more realistic ending.

4680975,4,B005FITIGO,"One interesting thing about the movie is that from the very beginning, I was constantly trying to label the good guys and the bad guys, since this the good-bad polarization of characters is typical of most mass production movies.  However, the more I got into the movie, the more I realized that there was no good guy or bad guy.  Every character was a mix of both good and bad.  The way this is presented is very well done in such a way that there is no simple conclusion after watching the movie but just many questions.  Another interesting factor is that none of the major players is exempt from greed, and every character has a way to rationalize that there is nothing wrong with their individual actions, it is always somebody else's fault and they are just caught in the middle.  Of course from a systems perspective every character is greedy and their collective actions is what accounts for the whole corporate greed.

While it wasn't something I would have been raving over had I spent (ridiculous) big screen theater dollars on, for a free couch potato session at the end of the work day- this movie was great.  The actors are all on point with their emotions and reactions to situations.  Kevin Spacey's angst over his various life situations comes through the screen and makes the viewer identify with his character despite the clear situational differences from a big firm exec and an amazon.com weeknight streamer.  The ending is both abrupt, off-putting, and perfectly executed.  The themes of big businesses brining the 99% down is far from overwhelming, but actually presented in this round about fashion that draws the viewer in at just the right points.  Great movie, give it a watch....",1378857600,,824,4.934782608695652

4681006,4,B005FITIGO,Kind of goes along with my theory that Wall Street creates these bubbles just to make themselves more money. Good acting and a reasonably good plot.

4681009,3,B005FITIGO,"For a much more detailed and intriguing analysis of the crash, I'd recommend reading Michael Lewis' book, The Big Short.

This movie covers the topic adequately, but I was a little disappointed by the superficial treatment of the technical aspects of the crash, and of some overly-preachy moments.

The movie failed to give any particular insight into the origins of the crash, and seemed to call on the standard stereotypes for the characters involved. I did appreciate that they didn't choose to portray any of the characters as black and white villains, but I felt that their attempts and humanizing the protagonists sometimes felt clumsy or overdone.

Overall - I don't regret watching the movie, but I was left wanting more.",1378339200,2,729,5.008264462809917

4681015,4,B005FITIGO,I found this film compelling. It gives you an inside look at how big business can make very bad decisions that result in negative consequences for the wrong people.

4681017,4,B005FITIGO,"If you can not watch a movie for nearly two hours and not fall asleep due to lack of car chases, shootouts, and clever catch-phrases, just spare yourself the agony and don't even contemplate watching this. There's more action to be found in an episode of Pawn Stars.

If you can endure a film that is shot almost entirely in one pile of steel and concrete as a setting, but need a climactic ending, then unless you've been comatose for the last half-dozen years, save yourself the letdown. There's also more intrigue in an episode of Pawn Stars.

A seeming amalgamation of the bad apples that collectively facilitated, or, depending on your opinion, caused the so-called ""so-called great recession"", the movie is part dramatization, documentary, and cautionary tale.

I think that I could probably shred aspects of this film taken as components, but really, the sum of those components worked for me.

Sure, there are lame Hollywood metaphors and a seemingly deliberate attempt to provide some false closure in the closing moments that even metaphorically didn't exactly translate well considering reality, but don't misinterpret that as a stereotypical ""happy ending.""

It was dull, predictable, and typical Hollywood recreation of reality, but was nonetheless engaging. And to it's credit, the film not only avoids a Hollywood ending in its truest understanding, but it also was careful not to engage in portraying anyone as innocent, a victim of bad guys. The reality that the outcome could be pinned on anyone and probably everyone isn't overtly pushed as a theme, but it's there for consumption if you so choose.

All in all, it's well-done and about as much as anyone could expect from a real Hollywood production that avoids the trappings of any specific genre. If the subject interests you and visual stimulation isn't a pre-requisite for movie enjoyment, you can do a whole lot worse than this film in the year 2013.",1377561600,,1925,5.0

4681030,5,B005FITIGO,"Here we have a timely R-rated thriller that takes place in an investment bank (which shall remain nameless) on Day One of our latest financial disaster. We start with a downsizing: an employee is walked to a glass-enclosed office and heartlessly ""let go,"" in full view of his coworkers. As Security escorts him to the elevator with his pathetic banker's box of personal items, he hands a zip drive to a young colleague with the admonition: ""I was working on this and you need to finish it. Be careful.""

By the time the young fellow completes the equations and realizes the magnitude of the situation, we are off and running. Of course with 20/20 hindsight, we know exactly how big and how brutal it was, what we only suspected was the extent of protection enjoyed by a self-serving top echelon of officers. Their ""take-home pay"" is mind-boggling.

Investment banking is still mostly a guy thing: look at the cast:
  * Kevin Spacey (""Horrible Bosses"") is a long-term employee, a company man who weeps first for his dying dog and then for his beleaguered company.
  * Paul Bettany (""The Young Victoria"") is a mid-level manager, a survivor who knows when to escalate a problem.
  * Zachary Quinto (""Star Trek"") is the former engineer turned risk analyst who is handed that zip drive by his exiting boss.
  * Stanley Tucci (""Captain America"") is the first man out the door. I loved his story about the impact of a bridge he built across a river in the mid-West before he came to New York.
  * Simon Baker (""The Mentalist"") is a shrewd operator who shaves before a 3:00 AM Executive Board meeting.
  * Jeremy Irons (""Appaloosa"") is the CEO who sees this as just another bump in the road.
  * Penn Badgley (""Easy A"") is a recently hired employee who sobs in a mens' room stall.
  * Demi Moore (""Another Happy Day"") tried to warn the officers a year earlier and is now told to keep her mouth shut.

It was a subdued screening audience that exited the theater. We have all felt the impact of that period of insanity and greed, so it's time to put faces on the villains. No gunshots, no car chases, no blowie uppie stuff, just self-serving people oblivious to their impact on the economy, and too arrogant to clean up their own toxic mess of derivatives. The R-rating is due to the profanity-laced language used by these fine folks. Get it at Amazon...",1375488000,3,2344,4.591346153846154

4681041,4,B005FITIGO,"Director and writer J. C. Chandor makes an impressive debut with this taut financial thriller.  With a host of ""A"" list actors in the cast, Chandor manages to take the abstruse world of Wall Street shenanigans that sent markets reeling in 2008, and makes them palatable for viewer consumption.

Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), a 19 year veteran manager of a Lehman Brothers-like firm is abruptly fired along with many others in the trading division.  He hands off information he had been working on to Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), a subordinate analyst.  Peter, who has a Ph. D. in rocket propulsion or something, is able to finish Eric projections.  They suggest that the bundled mortgage-backed securities owned by the firm will soon become worthless.  As this information is elevated throughout the firm, the various players work throughout the night to figure a way out.

Key players include Paul Bettany as Will who is Eric and Peter's boss.  He reports to Sam Rogers (terrific Kevin Spacey) who heads up the trading division.  Even higher in the food chain are risk manager, Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), CEO Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and chairman John Tuld (cool and collected Jeremy Irons).  Irrespective of their decisions, it would appear that the firm is toast, so the calculation is how to get out with the least pain, at least for those at the top.

Surprisingly, Chandor's story manages to create empathy for most of the players here.  With the exception of Cohen who suggested the risky strategy with hesitant help from Robertson and Tuld who made the decision, others were unaware of what was going on.  Many innocent employees of the firm will ultimately lose their job.  The firm makes a decision to sell all of their assets, without acquiring new ones.  As the word quickly gets out about the fire sale, the firm and the rest of those involved in risky financial vehicles like this bring the economy to its knees.  The rest is history.

The movie works in real time which adds a layer of intrigue as implications sink in for all involved.  This is a terrific film that provides an easy to understand look at the inner workings of one investment company.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  While there is nothing eye popping the transfer looks very good with a pleasant blue hint of tint (suits, ties, etc.) in many scenes.  The night shots of NYC look great with the bright lights of the skyline contrasting with the dark sky.  The audio has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also very good if not profound.  With the exception of a bustling trading floor and some exterior scenes most of the dialog heavy film is shot inside small rooms.

4681056,5,B005FITIGO,"Most of the movie plays out at night, high, high above ""The Street"" in one of those typical computer screen lit, fully glass windowed trading offices. A lot has changed since the time of the original 1987 ""Wall Street"" movie. Greed is still good and well, but there is no more charismatic Gordon Gekko trying to get ahead with stolen insider trading information. This is 2008, when most of the financial world is playing with fire; as financial ""products"" (mortgage backed securities, credit default swaps and extreme leveraging) with immense complexities create incredible profits, seemingly nobody knows exactly how the money flows from pockets to pockets. Nobody seems to understand the risks either, although there is a risk management team, everybody seems to be more annoyed with the signs of trouble than trying to heed the warning. In fact, the movie starts with the firing of one of the risk management analysts. Instead of Gordon Gekko there is only a seemingly clueless CEO, ""John Tuld"" (played superbly by Jeremy Irons). You may notice the name is slightly similar to Richard S. Fuld (Lehman Brothers).

The story is well described in all the earlier previews. What is the most striking motif here is that while the traders do their job by selling and buying massive amount of money segments, only few brokers with background in mathematics, physics (rocket science) could grasp the concept of volatility associated with the process. In fact, the higher position is someone in management, the more the single whistle blower trader (""Peter Sullivan"" played by Zachary Quinto) has to dumb down the explanation of the problem in order to be understood. But the problem is about to wreak havoc and billions of dollars could disappear ending the existence of this fictional firm, as the meltdown and financial crisis of 2008 is about to explode.

So time is money. The trading firm has to unload all of its toxic assets as fast as possible to make the most of the money while the rest of the financial world is still unaware of the disappearing value. Few points in sale price may mean 130 million dollar loss, yet the firm keeps unloading and liquidating its assets in a single day. This fire sale disregards any professionalism; a suicide mission that ignores friendship, trust, morals, the discount sale of worthless products means the acceptance of career ending loss of trust as well.

The cast is excellent. But Kevin Spacey gives the most gripping characterization of all. Above the level of management where an outside firing squad in a day could destroy his career by asking him to pack his belongings, he is also below the level of management where he would be truly untouchable and wealthy, he is the only one with moral dilemma. While everyone is talking about profits, income, cars and strippers, he is concerned about his professional credibility. He worries abbout the firm. He worries about the employees. He worries about the financial world. He worries, because seemingly he is the only one who cares about something else or more than money. But he does what needs to be done; single handedly and with nerves of steel he commands the remaining traders to sell off the assets. He only breaks down at the very end of the movie, crying alone in the dark while he has to bury his beloved dog.

An excellent movie it is in the spirit of ""Glengarry Glenn Ross"", ""Wall Street"" and ""Boiler Room"".",1369872000,,3413,4.869191049913941

4681064,5,B005FITIGO,"For me, the most satisfying movies are those that start with a great, intelligent script and match it with outstanding performances.  MARGIN CALL fits that tough standard very well indeed.  Writer/director JC Chandor has crafted a fill that makes the Wall Street machinations in the hours before the financial meltdown into a thriller that's character driven and as tense as a top-notch spy story.

Late one afternoon, just hours after 80% of the department he works in has been laid off, a data analyst at a gigantic trading firm (Zachary Quinto) discovers that the very foundation of the products his firm has been trading has been based on faulty assumptions.  It's too late to reverse the damage...the collapse of the firm is literally at hand.  He tells his boss (Paul Bettany) and the corporate damage control begins.  In many ways, MARGIN CALL is about how the news is received by each layer on the organizational chart, up to the CEO (Jeremy Irons)...all in the wee hours of the night.  Great drama is created simply by watching the realization sink in.  The posturing and maneuvering to cling to a high paying job is always there as well, and it's fascinating to watch.  I've spent a few years working on the lower rungs of ""corporate America"" (not in banking/trading) and really enjoyed the attention to detail in the corporate touches.  How as the next highest level person appearing on the scene makes the previously powerful person just a step down suddenly behave like a scared college intern.  And when the CEO arrives (by corporate helicopter, no less) you can feel the fear sweating out of these men and women as they a) break the horrible news to the man who can destroy them & b) work to maneuver the situation to their advantage.  It's a sinking ship, but each person wants to go down with it rather than be thrown overboard.

The performances are outstanding all around.  This movie is mostly talking, and it's mostly about fairly dry material.  But the script is so clear and crisp that it hums right along, and the actors all tear into it with gusto.  Kevin Spacey steals nearly all his scenes, but he's matched by the oily, riveting Irons.  Bettany is effective, and I really enjoyed Simon Baker in his role as an upper executive.  Also on hand in a smaller role was Stanley Tucci, who simply is unable to give an uninteresting performance.  Demi Moore has a small role, and I was reminded of what a great corporate mover and shaker she can be...thinking back to her role in DISCLOSURE nearly 20 years ago.

Sometimes, the script has to find ways to make the somewhat obtuse details of the financial collapse understandable to the viewer.  These are sometimes well handled, but sometimes a bit clumsy.  When your CEO says ""Explain it to me as though I was a child"", you know that's meant for the audience not the CEO.  The occasional inelegance of this device, as well as the annoying presence of Penn Badgley (a far inferior performer compared to the rest of the cast) as a friend of Quinto's who has nothing really to contribute to the events of the film keep this film just below the status of classic in my book.

But it's still an important film and it's riveting.  Even if you don't care about the details of the financial collapse, the film is well worth seeing.  When you've got Irons, Spacey, Tucci & Bettany all at the tops of their games...it's easy to strongly recommend MARGIN CALL.",1367625600,,3419,4.6755852842809364

The story in Margin Call covers an often sensitive subject, and creates a compelling drama. This is a film that relies solely on its dialogue. It does this right as it creates engaging and immersive conversations consistently that continuously move the movie forward. The ending of the film is amazing, and felt like a huge blow. The acting in this film is superb; Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, and Zachary Quinto are the standouts with their magnificent performances, although the rest of the cast did an amazing job.

There is a HBO movie called ""Too Big To Fail"" that is actually factual but much more entertaining if you are interested in the 2008 economic crisis. The HBO movie explains economics in a way that most of us can understand.

If you have no idea what anybody is talking about in any depth it cannot be very enjoyable although Jeremy Irons makes a couple of good analogies in the movie. That is the only redeeming feature of this movie in my opinion.

4681095,5,B005FITIGO,"*This review contains spoilers*

It's quite an achievement to make a movie about a boring subject and keep the viewer engaged throughout, but Margin Call does just that. It's a financial drama, depicting events leading up to the last stock market crash in 2008.

The movie begins with a scene showing Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) being laid off. He's in risk management for an investment company. When he's informed of the decision, he's escorted back to his office to pick up his belongings, and then made to leave the building. His phone service is immediately terminated and he's told to forget about anything he was working on as it's no longer his problem. But Dale hands a USB drive to a colleague before he leaves, advising him to be careful.

The colleague is Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), who takes a look at Dale's research when everyone else has left the office. His findings set in motion a series of events taking place over 24 hours, during which we are shown how a financial crisis might be handled.

Many scenes involve people looking at computer screens and talking about the worrying implications, but the excellent screenplay makes us anticipate what is coming next. There is a little technical jargon, but it doesn't matter if you don't understand anything about Mortgage Backed Securities. The beauty of the story is in showing the chain of command, and the way in which people respond to the unfolding events.

We see the problem being talked about by Sullivan and a junior analyst, and they decide to tell their immediate superior, Will (Paul Bettany). He then calls in his boss, Sam (Kevin Spacey). As the night wears on, a series of meetings take place. Other department heads are called in, and ultimately the man who decides the overall strategy (Jeremy Irons). Eric Dale cannot be traced, and the decision to terminate his services causes problems to all concerned.

My favorite scene involves Dale talking about his former career as an engineer. He reveals how much of a difference one man can make, and shows some of the traits which earned him his job in risk management.

The movie depicts leadership, reaction to stress, and how a strategy was devised to resolve the situation with as little damage to the company as possible. Ruthless decisions were called for and made, and the story has an undeniable ring of truth at every turn. That's not surprising when you realize that director J.C. Chandor's father worked for Merrill Lynch for 30 years.

Margin Call is a movie that's well-written, well-acted,and surprisingly gripping. It might even make you question your investment strategy. Although I loved Wall Street, I think Margin Call is my favorite story set in the world of finance.

The whole thing is like a game, there's no real gravity to any of this. People telling each other 'F' u and 'F' me all the time does not make for realism, drama or emotion. That is empty and phony, a substitute for Drama. As in life, that often shows a lack of more intelligent communication skills. People trying to look shocked while looking at computer screens and then calling the next level manager ""You've gotta see this"".  Pathetic. NOTHING is explained. Interesting when Jeremy Irons asks for frank discussion and gets a few minutes of vague BS, the topic is then diverted and no one cares about anything except their own asses. The actors do the best they can but there's nothing to work with here. I could not stand Demi More's Character (the rightous, the innocent, and her bailout package 'better be good').  It's all so neat, no consequences and everyone escapes.  Maybe that's the point, but then a very serious subject to the American people is disgracefuly trivialized. I'm surprised because Hollywood usually is very 'self righteous' in demonzing the rich and greedy (as if they are not that).  Not that that's what this movie needed, but it did need some kind of point which you won't find here.

4681111,5,B005FITIGO,"I worked for brokerage firms for a few years right out of college. This movie really captures the look, feel and thinking process of the big brokers. Well acted, with just enough technical detail to explain what's going on but not enough to confuse people. They don't go into how CDOs and credit default swaps based on financial plays - including no-doc, 120% loan-to-value mortgages granted to people who didn't have a prayer of repaying them - helped tank the economy in ways that are still destroying people's lives today. It's low-key, with a minimum of romantic, melodramatic b.s., which I appreciated. I liked this movie so much I broke down and bought the DVD before it became available to be streamed on Amazon Prime for free. This is a movie for people who don't consider thinking an onerous chore and who don't cherish any sentimental illusions about how money's made on Wall Street. I wish that category included a lot more people in this country; maybe then we'd elect fewer mush-brains to public office and have a stronger regulatory system for the financial services industry.

4681112,4,B005FITIGO,"Largely set in the clean-looking office of an unnamed Wall Street investment firm, ""Margin Call"" offers a dramatized account of how a catastrophic financial collapse begins to emerge. No company is named, but we all know for sure where the film is really set. Written and directed by J.C. Chandor, whose screenplay was nominated for Oscar (Best Writing, Original Screenplay), ""Margin Call"" unfolds like a well-made stage play with an excellent cast including Penn Badgley, Simon Baker, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey, Zachary Quinto and Stanley Tucci.

The film starts with a sudden mass layoff of the firm's employees including Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), who has been in charge of risk management. In the scene (that reminds us of ""Up in the Air"") we sense something is not going well here. Before leaving the office, Eric gives a USB drive to a young analyst Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), warning him to ""be careful.""

Late at night Paul manages to complete the task Eric was forced to leave unfinished. We know what he is about to learn. The company is doomed.

""Margin Call"" works as a morality tale told against the backdrop of the recent financial collapse we still suffer. You don't have to know much about the financial markets (for those who need a comprehensive analysis of the crisis, there are several documentaries including ""Inside Job""). ""Margin Call"" is most effective when quietly describing how the firm's employees and CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) react to the disaster that is inevitable.

Perhaps some might think with less subplots (a dying dog episode, for instance), ""Margin Call"" would have been slicker and more intense. Still, the director knows what he is doing and he does it very well. With superb acting all around, the film is engrossing and even suspenseful as a drama, even though we know where the story is going.",1359158400,,1873,4.955414012738854

4681115,4,B005FITIGO,"In 2008, on the eve of the globalized economic meltdown, a young analyst at a Lehmen-Brothers-esque financial institution, comes to a startling conclusion.  His firm is dangerously over-leveraged with cancerous assets and is only weeks away from a complete and total collapse.  Faced with a seven-figure payoff, he and his fellow traders are asked to make a choice.  Are they willing to bite the bullet and reap the consequences of their own greed, or should they sell the toxic assets in one fierce day of trading, thus further spreading the disease to the rest of an already strained financial industry?

Hailed by David Denby of The New Yorker as ""one of strongest American films of the year and easily the best Wall Street movie ever made,"" Margin Call is the sharply-written debut effort from writer-director J.C. Chandor.  Shot against the New York skyline, it dares to look at these ""gods"" staring down from their lofty towers of privilege and power and asks the question: can you humanize the demonized?  Or, in this era of Nietzschian politics, must you continue to paint them as sub-human monsters fit only for extermination.

4681118,2,B005FITIGO,"""Margin Call"" (2011) is a role model for making good money (for some, not all) from a low budget quickie movie

I gave the movie a ""2 out of 5"" rating, which was charitable. Great or even good art, this was not.

That stated, the financial venture part of the movie's history (reported in a Wikipedia article about the movie) is worth a close look.

The project was cleverly executed, done quickly for a roughly $3 million dollar budget, and made 5 times that much (roughly $16 million dollars) by the time was finished being shown in movie houses.

The movie is clever....tricky is also a good word to describe it.

It features very famous and skilled actors and was shot in one location mostly in roughly one month (July 2010) in New York City, mostly.

The famous actors part of the movie included Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons (both Best Actor Academy Award Winners), Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci.

All heavyweights, all actors probably paid a lot of money up front from the $3 Million dollar budget, which otherwise was done on shoestring money remarked on repeatedly and continually by the director, Mr. J. C. Chandor, during the interesting and worth listening to ""director's commentary"" special feature part of the movie available in the DVD home version.

The project was thrifty in ways movies can be and have been often in the past. This meant six figure figures (maybe large six figure figures) could be paid up front to Spacey, Irons, Moore, and Tucci.

Everybody else probably got peanuts and glory, and maybe deferred payment agreements (which when honored were likely good.....those paid in deferred money had roughly $13 million dollars to divide at least part of).

What was the result which turned a profit of roughly $13 million dollars for $3 million dollar up front investment?

Well........the movie did the ""Curse Of The Cat People"" (1943) thing of being a film noir type movie with the ""unknown monster in the closet"" dangled through most of the movie ....and dangled skillfully by expert actor danglers (Spacey, Irons, Tucci, Moore).

It took advantage of the fact most people don't understand Wall Street and big banker gobble-dee-gook terminology, and presented a corporate crisis meltdown scenario where the reason the corporation of ""suits"" faced bad times was never clearly explained....in spite of the (cynical) repeated phrase ""explain that to me in plain English"" (never really done) when the ""what's the problem?"" question is asked and answered.

The audience never has the question answered of why there is ""trouble in River City with a capital 'T'."" ""MBS's"" (mortgage based securities) are mentioned in passing, always as an initial-ism.

""MBS's"" are reported as the reason Lehman Bros. and Bear Sterns went under in 2008, and Goldman Sachs survived somehow.

But not in this movie......the Wikipedia ""Margin Call Movie"" article mentions it briefly.

People who don't check the Wikipedia description don't learn that.

Viewers just learn the company is in trouble and people have to stay up several days and nights in a row facing terrible threats possibly disastrous.

These people are all rich (big money incomes are mentioned repeatedly in the script), so they face losing a lot and that is, for dramatic purposes, more tragic than, say, an entire group in a MacDonald's hamburger stand location employees and managers facing loss of income and unemployment.

The fact this is the message of the movie is part of the reason why I gave it low grades as a piece of art or valuable script writing.

This movie is all about style and technique (delivered well by the big money actors well showcased in the simple film noir show presented), and piggybacking onto the headlines people don't understand about ""Wall Street In Trouble"" (esp. the 2008 crisis widely headlined and reported, never explained well anywhere.......every try to read the book titled ""Too Big To Fail"" (2010) by Andrew Sorkin about it all? Good luck to you!).

""Margin Call"" (2011) is the movie equivalent to an avant Gard stage play presented on a bare stage with a black velvet background curtain, four fold-up chairs, an a hanging light-bulb where very good actors present a story showing they are all in trouble, and act, skillfully, in troubled ways saying troubled things.

""No Exit"" by Jean Paul Sartre (done often by college drama depts. looking for drama without big stage design and costume bills) is an example of this kind of animal.

Well.......""Margin Call"" (2011) made a lot of money relative to it's investment ($13 million dollars profit after repaying an initial investment of $3 million).

Not bad.

The movie itself is no big deal, even with the heavyweight actors part of it.....it's like the old joke about Chinese restaurants, and being hungry half an hour after you eat in one.

It's not satisfying and it's not substantial, and people who label it with 5 stars (very many where it is reviewed by the hundreds who took time to do that) have low standards.

But so what?

These are times of low standards, and democracy in movie reviewing is urged on us by the likes of Amazon. Com and it's wholly owned subsidiary website, IMDb. Com.

People with low standards buy things, and that includes doubtful movies like ""Margin Call"" (2011).

Meanwhile, Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci get paid enough to continue living the good life of rich movie stars, and only a tiny percentage of movies any of them work in are truly good movies.

4681145,3,B005FITIGO,"This movie is another one in a line of movies I have recently watched that have incredibly good actors playing parts that were really just not worthy of their acting ability.  Whether that is the fault of the casting director, the actor (poor role selection) or some issue on directing it is hard to say, but this movie just never gels.  Ultimately the viewer comes away unsatisfied.  The movie includes 3 Academy Award winning actors - Jeremy Irons (Academy Award for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reversal-of-Fortune/dp/B001RGGXRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reversal of Fortune</a>&nbsp;Reversal of Fortune), Kevin Spacey (Academy Award for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty/dp/B005721Y7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty</a>&nbsp;American Beauty) and Stanley Tucci (Academy Award for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lovely-Bones/dp/B003IBEH02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lovely Bones</a>&nbsp;The Lovely Bones).  Add to that several other very good well known actors - and I was expecting a much better movie.

The movie takes place in basically a 24 hr period inside an investment firm.  A senior investment manager is working on some kind of project - the day that the firm is laying off 80% of its work force.  The senior manager is let go, and as he walks out, he hands a thumb drive to a younger analyst who survived the cut (this is the first hint this movie is not going to be very good, the idea that security would have allowed this guy to take a thumbrive with him is not realistic).  He says something like ""take a look"" and so as the young analyst's friends go out for a nite of drinking to celebrate surviving the cut, the young analyst ""solves"" the missing pieces of the work of the senior manager, calls his friends and shows them this ""startling"" discovery.  At this point, a series more and more senior people are ""called in"" to view this discovery, and each level up, the seriousness of this discovery becomes more an more alarming.

The movie then just goes into stupid mode.  It is like 2 am when the office manager (played by Kevin Spacey) is called back, and he calls some guy who is really not introduced well (played by Simon Baker) who is younger, better dressed, and seems like some kind of useless middleman.  He then calls the head of the board (played by Jeremy Irons) and then somehow magically the entire board is called in, they all show up at like 4am spotlessly dressed.  Meanwhile, the young analyst and his friend who also survived the cut are out looking for the senior manager who was fired.  They cannot reach him because his blackberry was turned off . . . and so on.  It just gets dumb at this point because these two young guys are wandering around New York (they stop at a strip club for some reason) and just are all over the place looking for the senior manager.  They come back, then a more senior guy (played by Paul Bettany) goes out with them.

The young analyst is a nuclear engineer who left his prior job for more money etc.  There are just too many characters in the movie that are not introduced or whose role really is not explained.  Like, why is Demi Moore's character in this movie even there?  I never did get what her position was exactly.  Eventually the characters start pointing fingers at each other over this ""discovery"" which the viewer still has no idea what they discovered.  Eventually the viewer finds out - sort of - what the discovery is (and I will not list it here and spoil the movie).  Let me just say that the full explanation of the discovery is totally anticlimactic.

I co-teach a graduate engineering law and ethics course, and I was hoping this movie might provide some prescient statements of ethical or social/moral issues.  It really doesn't.  In the end, the investment firm engages in a ""fire sale"" and ruins its reputation in the saving of the firm.  The viewer is supposed to connect this I guess to the Bear Stearns failure in 2007.  However, there is no real explanation of what a ""risk manager"" is or what hedging is.  It just came off as flat to me.  Yes, the characters are mostly sycophants and narcissists (and mostly well acted this way) - but, where there is an opportunity for some reflection and moral self-analysis by some of the characters - they never do - even the fired senior manager and the idealistic young analyst ultimately just join the rest of the characters in the grand fire sale scheme.

My only complaint about the movie was its excessive us of profanity, particularly the f-work.

What I got out of the movie wasn't so much that wall streeters were to blame; more so I think the filmmaker suggests that these behaviors are a societal or global issue that needs attention by everyone.  One of the characters justifies it through a human nature argument, which was interesting, that people can't help but be who they are.  My favorite part of the movie is probably when Paul Bettany's character is talking to the guy that's going to be fired.

""Listen if you really want to do this with your life, you have to believe that you're necessary and you are.  People want to live like this in their cars and their big houses.

4681179,5,B005FITIGO,"Cascading talents of Zachary Quinto, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Spacey, Simon Baker, and Jeremy Irons sieve the emotions out of an about-to-fall-apart Wall Street firm the night before the market opens. They don't talk about technical details, only the emotions acted out in the actors' faces and dialogue as one might imagine on real executives' faces when the ""big one"" comes.

Most recent jaw-dropping Wall Street debacle I kept thinking of, as I was watching this movie, was what happened to Knight Capital Group (KCG). This financial firm lost about $400 Million in about 20 minutes due to a software glitch that spent several billion dollars meant to be spread over several months in less than half an hour. Its share value collapsed. It still hasn't recovered as of writing this review.

What might have gone through the faces of people in KCG? This movie gives a glimpse of what might have happened: Nothing to those at the highest level, played by Irons, who asks a younger analyst to tell him what is going on as if he was ""a child or a dog"". Irons plays a character of hard cold emotions oblivious to what happens to many, but in need of the loyalty and even affection of the few--suggesting a marginal glow of emotion.

Just below him is a colder and utterly emotionless positional leader played by Baker, who is best known as the Mentalist. His character is meant to eclipse whatever emotion the higher up might have. And below him the leader of the smart worker bees. This role, the most demanding, is played by Spacey masterfully: displaying the dichotomy of being emotional and not. The push and pull of wanting something and not. The resistance creates an internal hurricane not many actors can pull off, and make it look like he's not acting.

At the lowest level are those whose emotions are not yet in check, controlled, or eliminated altogether. What-if scenarios swirl in their minds into desperation and tears. But not for the character played by Quinto, who became famous in the TV show Heroes and the better made Star Trek movie. To say that he gets a promotion later would not give up anything about this story. The character is a prime candidate capable of ridding of all emotions like a Vulcan.

The story makes a point of a distorted reality: money as an end. Yet we have learned from the best known distortionist of reality, Steve Jobs, that money should never be an end, but a means to create great products that people will want to buy. He proved that human resources of Apple can trump over the natural resources of Exxon. That last comment was in defense of capitalism. Either way, while emotions must be controlled, they are, ultimately, called for to be human.",1349740800,8,2690,4.714893617021277

4681183,5,B005FITIGO,"That film is a pamphlet against an unregulated financial market and the story of that catastrophe that occurred in 2008 started after the 1929 crisis when Keynesian policies of all types were instated for individuals to buy on credit and even for the states to do the same. These policies have produced the credit crisis in Europe that we know now; Then in the 70s and 80s, especially with Reagan, and then when the Soviet bloc was out of the picture and no international competition was to be taken into account, we decided to get rid of all regulations on financial markets. Happy were the Chinese who recuperated Hong Kong in 1999 and kept a strict control over their financial markets.

This deregulation of financial markets produced the subprime crisis that we know in 2008. But we have to keep in mind that we are all responsible because we elected the politicians we elected and we let them do anything and they on their side let the financiers do anything they wanted. And we know what happened and what we are still suffering because of it.

The film does not concentrate on the horrific trauma the crisis is for the simple traders of the financial firm that is considered here. It concentrates on how the crisis can be managed by this firm who is happy to know before everyone else. They find out when the assistant sale manager who was just let go and who had devised a program to assess the financial situation of the firm, gives the USB key with it on his way out to the young rocket engineer who runs it and is able to project the present situation into the future. Too late boys and girls: in less than a week the whole financial Titanic hits rock bottom two miles under the iceberg.

Within two days the truth must have come out, first day and first night, and then the problem must be solved to avoid bankruptcy and judicial lawsuits, second day. The boss then has to take a decision and it is simple. In the second day of this two day emergency 93% of all the spoiled assets must be sold, even at a loss. Better lose 20% than everything. And it has to be done by the traders who must be convinced to do it before the Stock Exchange closes in the afternoon.

They are motivated with the announcement that they will all lose their jobs but that everyone who will reach the selling quota of 93% will get a more than one million premium, and if the department manages the same global quota, each trader will get an extra more than one million premium, nearly three millions all together. And they will do it, they will cut the branch on which they are sitting because of this nice little parachute or cushion given to them to soften the fall. Speak of faithfulness and loyalty.

During that time the boss is playing his associates, deputies and other executives one against the others to select the two or three he will need afterwards. Because they liquidate their own firm, they lose all credibility and all customers, but since the crisis will explode just after that black day, which is a Friday of course, they will be accused of having started it, but in the longer run they will become geniuses and will recuperate their credibility and credit to start a new adventure, a financial speculative adventure of course, no matter what the conditions will be then.

But you cannot flush the financial markets out of the picture. You have to get them under control and keep them under control. If we just blazed these financial firms out of the way we would be forgetting that we ALL need what they are providing: credit. We have an instalment purchasing plan here for a car, a house, a washing machine. We have a credit card there that gives us free or nearly free credit for slightly more than a month, though we cannot afford to overdraw at the end of the month when the credit card payments are balanced from your account, except if we can pay a 16 or 18% interest.

And I repeat we are all responsible because we elected those who let the speculators come into the picture at first through the chimney like Santa Claus then through the window, finally through the door, at first under the table, then around the table and finally in the middle of the table top. It is high time proper authorities put all these financial people under control and get us rid of the immoral ones, those who are so un-ethical that you cannot reform them any more. That is difficult, that will be difficult, that will hurt. Let's hope all will foot the bill proportionally to their resources and means.

And dram on the ending that is so similar to the end of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, the salesman planting carrot seeds at night in his garden that does not get any sunshine anyway.

4681184,1,B005FITIGO,"What we should be pondering aren't the merits or flaws of such time-wasting fare as Margin Call, but if all the positive reviews here on amazon aren't perhaps a signal of the coming apocalypse.  Surely, Margin Call receiving even one 5 star rating is cause for alarm.

Wow, was this awful.  My wife and I watched this on-demand a few nights ago.  It was a slow, vague, thrill-less, stupid docu-drama about an anonymous uber-company passing the financial buck around 2008.  I realized that it was probably going to suck about 20 minutes in.  The film just had no center.  No real reason to exist outside the fact that this crappy stuff happened and a few people would definitely watch it if such a film was made.  An hour in, I knew I had to review it on amazon, warning others of the danger.  At that point, I felt sorry for the actors.  What could they have done with such a terrible script and, probably, director?  Not much, apparently.

Margin Call is just-how-bad-can-this-thing-get worthy.  On the bright side, maybe the next generation can make a drinking game out of it.  When an actor says something dumb, pointless, or hopelessly contrived - drink!

My wife said it wasn't all that bad.  But then, of course, she said the exact same thing about the turd Wallstreet 2: Money Never Sleeps.

But if I didn't know better I would say the script was written for a low budget film.  There were very few locations...and too much dialogue (and I generally enjoy slow paced films as long as the characters are developing and I'm learning about them.)  I went from enjoying the story to wondering if it were going to 'get going' to waiting for it to hurry and end.  Basically there's not much to the characters and the main theme drags....and drags....and drags.

4681199,4,B005FITIGO,"Most reviews (below) cover the salient features of this movie that employed an excellent cast of prize winning actors. Even though MARGIN CALL clearly and accurately presents the culture of a high stakes Wall Street investment organization, it does so haltingly. Each of the actors did an excellent job of presenting his or her character. However, missing was strong character dynamics ... or at least the changes were very subtle; and that is derived from the script rather than the considerable skills of Kevin  Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Demi Moore, Jeremy Irons, et al. Unlike certain analogous TV series such as THE GOOD WIFE, MARGIN CALL does not keep moving all the time. Although most of the time the story keeps the action going, occasionally the drama slows down and some times even seems contrived. Such as when the upper echelon of the firm waits on the roof of the sky scraper office building for arrival of the top man in his helicopter. One of the characters climbs over a fence staring down at the street dozens of stories below ... scaring his companions that the firm's financial crisis had made him contemplate suicide (a financial clich).

4681203,5,B005FITIGO,"One of the great themes of modern literature and film is the banality of evil. The casual, gradual descent of ordinary workaday life into increasingly unethical, socially destructive behavior, often without our being aware of it. So that when we finally realize it, it's too late; we're trapped. The small, routine, mundane lies we tell each other in the course of our jobs, to get ahead in business, to get the edge; to succeed, to win, can eventually add up to enormous consequences, as they do here. In an ethically bankrupt system, fudging the truth can seem necessary, because not to might put one at a disadvantage. And so deceit becomes invisible, accepted, habitual. Everybody does it because everybody does it. And before we know it, we're the bad guys.

Like GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, MARGIN CALL is a brilliant, unsettling look at the modern business environment, where the pressure to succeed damages not just the social fabric, but ourselves as well. Lying to each other is bad enough, but lying to ourselves is worse. In a system that rewards ruthlessness and punishes integrity, sociopaths rise to the top.

There are no guns in this movie, no car explosions, no chase scenes, no digital FX, but MARGIN CALL is as dark, brutal and white-knuckle a portrait of evil as you're ever likely to see. The increasing sense of impending disaster is palpable, especially since you know where it's all headed. The characters are complex, finely-drawn and very human. And though no one is redeemed, they seem strangely sympathetic since we identify with (and pity) them, like hapless rats lost in a maze. As Jeremy Irons' character puts it, ""We can't help ourselves."" In the end, all are caught in their own traps, selling each other down the river because, as Kevin Spacey's character says, ""I just need the money.""

But despite its grim subject, MARGIN CALL is too gripping to be depressing. And watching villains rationalize and justify themselves is always fascinating. It holds up a disturbing mirror to capitalism, so naturally some people won't like it. But it's a riveting, nuanced morality tale, told largely between the lines, and for those who grasp the larger implications, it is far more chilling than any action/thriller or horror movie.

4681205,3,B005FITIGO,"Before I saw this movie, I thought it had a lot going for it. Being about the financial crisis of 2008, it sounded like it would have a good story, a good plot. It had a strong cast of actors - Stanley Tucci, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany.

After watching the movie, I felt it still had a strong cast of actors. But the story was a bit of a letdown. At the end of the movie, I sat there for a good five minutes trying to figure out how exactly I felt about this movie. It started out strong and fast-paced - it had me hooked into the story. Then about halfway through, it just seemed to fall apart. The pace slowed down, and the story became bland and kind of dull. It felt muddled with all the characters in there. And Penn Badgley's character seemed kind of pointless. His character showed the idealistic, naive kid who wanted to work in the financial market all his life. But really, it just felt like one character too many for the story. By no means was this a terrible movie - I liked it despite its flaws.

4681206,5,B005FITIGO,"In truth, haven't paid much attention to films dealing with the fiscal meltdown and various human failures preceding The Great Recession. However, had a free slot open and figured, what the heck? It has Kevin Spacey and Paul Bettany, actors whom I've long respected and liked. How bad could it be?

Well, it wasn't. Not by a long shot.

Beyond what the average person learns from the few unbiased journalists and angry duped investors, don't know too much about toxic mortgage products, derivatives, credit default swapping and the various gamblers who infest the industry to ply and play their games. But this stunning film cuts to heart of the issue - regardless of whether or not you're an addict in denial.

Opens with an entry level analyst who picks up an incendiary project from his recently fired boss; tossed away in a typical ""reorganization"" that essentially eviscerated various divisions within a financial services company. Intuitively following up on the cryptic last comment made by his former superior, what he helps uncover is the tip of a terrifying iceberg - one that would eventually become a tipping point to global catastrophe.

Forget the big names. We're talking families in homes that they should not have been able to afford, now on the streets. Millions of jobs lost that are never coming back. Frighteningly close to a breakdown of social order. The lives of average citizens upended and gutted. People who had absolutely nothing to do with what those soulless whores did to make an easy buck is revealed in this disturbing production.

This struck a chord, reminding me of another film. An evil form of mathematics that worked out the cost-benefit ratio in its purest essence. In 2001 HBO released, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conspiracy/dp/B00005YUO1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conspiracy</a>"", detailing the 1941 meeting of Nazi hierarchy that laid out the foundation for The Final Solution. No morality, no ethics, no compassion, no humanity. Whatever worked out best for those sitting at the table - that's the plan. Simple as that. And the fictitious firm in 'Margin Call' is undoubtedly very much true-to-life of most, if not all, these types of businesses. Wannsee exponentially cubed.

Thought it was fascinating that none, not even the senior analyst played by Spacey, heartbroken over the death of his beloved dog, are anything near sympathetic. You don't feel compassion for these people because they're not worthy of such generosity. These are self-serving manipulators who are out to get theirs - period. Any concept of ""honor"" or ""community"" does not exist for these muckers. In my opinion, for the most part, they're functioning sociopaths. One moment crying for a dying pet, the next, happily celebrating the symbolic deaths of their ill-fated colleagues, encouraging others to feel the same by specifically instructing them to totally and completely forget their existence. Wow.

My understanding, confirmed by various dictionaries and medical profiles I perused, is that these people exhibit the very definition of sociopathy. If not naturally, then as part of an accepted set of rather appalling behaviors.

Appreciated that the filmmakers gave us the choice of humanizing them or not.

Not.

Simultaneously revealing that the general populace is indeed as gullible as implied throughout the script. I looked up the dates that Jeremy Iron's character mentions in the film - 1637, 1797, 1819, 1827, 1857, 1884, 1901, 1907, 1929, 1937, 1974, 1987, 1992, 2000, etc. I was stunned. He's right. The gamblers can't help themselves. Especially when they're in positions of power such as government. There's no such thing as oversight, because our leaders are heavily invested in and paid recipients of the game. Terrifying.

Personal Notes:

- Paul Bettany's car speech is, despite the context, a bravura performance. Taking J.C. Chantos' words and imbuing them with a depth and quality sincerely equal to any Shakespearean soliloquy.

Seth: ""Bleep, this is really going to affect people. Real people.""

Will: ""Seth, listen, if you really want to do this with your life you have to believe you're necessary - and you are. People want to live like this - in their cars, in their big bleeping houses they can't even pay for - then you're necessary. The only reason they all get to continue living like kings is 'cause we've got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off, well then the whole world gets really bleeping fair, really bleeping quickly. And nobody actually wants that. They say they do, but they don't. They want what we have to give them, but they also want, you know, to play innocent and pretend to have no idea where it came from. And that's more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow. So bleep them. Bleep normal people.""

Yep. And the scary part is that - he's not wrong. Bookies can't feel sorry for the avarice driven dupes that utilize their services. No one is holding a gun to anyone's head to play the market.

- It's embarrassingly enjoyable, but when things turn truly desperate, I enjoyed watching the sharks devouring the other sharks. Those who thought to keep themselves 'safe', ultimately left without a chair when the music stopped. Small repayment, a tiny fractional bit of karmic justice, as several characters - including one of the architects of the twisted packaged mortgages plan - is told she will be the fatted calf, the sacrifice. After all her scheming and backstabbing - it's her reputation and career that will be publicly butchered. Ha ha.",1346544000,6,5585,5.114160263446762

4681212,5,B005FITIGO,"A lot of the negative reviews seem to be from people who expected this to be a documentary.  It does not claim to be that.  It is based on the Lehman Brothers collapse but does not attempt to analyze it or even explain it in much detail.  In fact, it only covers about 36 hours of the meltdown.  This film is a work of dramatic fiction that follows a group of people who are facing the realization that their current prosperity is based on a house of cards and is about to undergo a ""correction"" that will fundamentally change their lives.  And the change will not come in weeks or months, but that very day.

The point of the film is watching that group of people deal with the crisis on corporate and personal levels; often having to make some very unsavory choices.  The film's high quality comes from the script, which moves forward inexorably as the scope of the disaster becomes clear, and the fine group of actors, who deliver some excellent performances.  I would say there is only one false note in it: Paul Bettany teetering on edge; but I still consider his to be one of the standout performances.

Some reviewers complain that the film is boring.  I have always been somewhat fascinated by Wall Street, so I cannot evaluate that claim.  When I saw it on pay-per-view I thought it was riveting.  In fact, when it was over I restarted it and watched it again.  But there is very little technical detail in the movie.  I think even people whose eyes glaze over at any mention of financial instruments will find this movie rewarding.

In short, if you are looking for a documentary, you will be disapponted.  Likewise, if you are looking for car chases, fist-fights, or moralizing feel-good endings, this will not be your cup of tea.

4681214,4,B005FITIGO,"Think ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" scaled up and toned down.  Kevin Spacey is in both films, of course.  Paul Bettany, as the hotshot yet dissatisfied trading manager, looks like a young, twitchy Ed Harris.  Simon Baker, though not nearly as loud, is more than reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's character Blake.  Could just be my imagination though, as could this: Stanley Tucci, playing the sacked quant who first spots the financial blowup coming, closely resembles Nassim Nicholas Taleb, of Black Swan fame, who also predicted the 2008 crash.  Director and screenwriter J. C. Chandor was very clever to put these allusions into the film, if indeed he did.

The superb ensemble acting is the main draw here.  Jeremy Irons fully redeems the cliched Slimey Limey villain role he's given.  Kevin Spacey is great as the seen-it-all veteran who discovers that he has not in fact ever seen anything like the looming catastrophe he must now manage.  Penn Badgley and Zachary Quinto do a fine job as the newbies who suddenly find themselves in deep water, Quinto to be promoted and Badgley to be canned.  I've seen Demi Moore in so many bombs, that it's very good to see her excel in a movie of substance here.  There is much peering into monitors, much side-eyeing around conference tables, many expressions of dawning incredulity--so much so that one YouTube remix has a scene with the dialog removed, only the reaction shots remaining.

The simplification of the crisis is understandable, if only not to baffle the general public who are unfamiliar with the jargon of the milieu but it has been dummied down to moronic level. If the film making had been dynamic, it would not have been left to the actors to create the tension of this major crisis. Unfortunately, the exposition is so painstakingly and boringly rolled out that the actors are doomed to failure. It was an insurmountable task.

4681239,5,B005FITIGO,"Having spent a good part of my working career in financial markets and having been on both sides of corporate restructures, I feel that I am in good position to comment on ""Margin Call"".

The essence of ""Margin Call"" is a 24 hour period when a large New York investment bank comes to the realisation that it has seriously underestimated its potential exposure to risky and illiquid financial instruments.  In the argot of the industry, the bank has an enormous ""value at risk"".  However, it only came to this understanding by accident.  A ""down-sized"" employee stumbles upon the problem and leaves it to a 28 year old ""rocket scientist"" to finish his work.

The bank is shocked to its core.  It drags its board together in the dead of night to consider its options.  In fact, there is really only one.  Namely, the bank's huge position will have to be cut the following day and damn the consequences.

This is a tightly scripted film with an excellent cast. Paul Bettany as the desk manager, Kevin Spacey as the dealing room's chief and Jeremy Irons as the bank's chairman are all excellent.  They have real street cred.  Dealing rooms spawn often less than endearing individuals.  ""Margin Call"" reflects this fact well.

I thoroughly recommend this film.  It is plausible and certainly timely given the events of the past several years in global markets.",1337731200,,1355,4.7844827586206895

The rest of the movie is trying to figure out the the financials and how to come out of the crisis. All the CEOS then gather for an all night marathon trying to figure an exit plan. The chief boss is Tuld, whose name coincidentally rhymes with Richard Fuld, the clueless and useless CEO of Lehman Bros. Here however, Tuld is a warrior and he asks for information in plain english, `' speak to me as if you were speaking to a child, or a golden retriever.

I don't know why Penn Badgley was in this movie. For as much screen time as he had, he looked perpetually lost - and not in a good way. Zachary Quinto was just okay. Though he's the same guy who plays Spock, I had a hard time believing that he could be a rocket scientist here. I spent more time admiring his hair than his performance. Paul Bettany was surprisingly good, I thought. He had an interesting monologue toward the end, and I thought he nailed it.

I love the idea of this movie. I should've been blown away by the sheer gravitas of the acting talent involved. Unfortunately, the performances only served to elevate the thinly written story.

Margin Call succeeds as a topical, mature, and well-made film - Oliver Stone wishes he could say as much for Wall Street 2.

""Margin Call"" feels much more gritty and real. The good thing about the movie is that it pretty much just tells the story of a hypothetical investment bank (Lehman? Bear?) at the start of the financial meltdown without a lot of political bluster. I thought the movie could have done a little better job of explaining the underlying mortgage-backed securities that precipitated the mess. I have a layman's working understanding of the underlying securities, but some viewers may not have followed the details of the crisis in actual news reports.

4681255,5,B005FITIGO,"""Margin Call"" is a drama film that examines a 36-hour period of time in a fictional New York investment bank during the lead up to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

The narrative gives particular attention to individual employees in the investment bank who face questions of morality when it becomes apparent that they are staring at a major financial collapse. But they have the advantage of acting before the rest of the market gets wind of the situation if they choose to. Subsequently, resolutions are considered which are self-interested and that will leave a tidal wave of destruction, yet resistance to surviving at the expense of other firms and investors faces the monumental barrier of greed.

The film characters represent a variety of philosophies with the pitiless on one side and those that follow moral principles on the other. Both sides and those in the middle collide in a tense tug of war over varying perspectives of what is the right action to take.

With a superb film cast and a well crafted story that covers the viewpoint of those whose hands control the financial future of the world, the viewer is treated to an enthralling movie.

To the average citizen who is not familiar with economics, this movie will no doubt be as boring as watching paint dry.

The problem ?

The movie really does nothing more than show people stressing out over seeing their high flying way of life come to an end.

There is no good detail or explanation of how financial models and the world of investing really work for the general audience.

Jeremy Irons character was truly outstanding in his merciless disregard for others, whether they be his employees, customers or the general populace. He simply didn't care. Modern day evil.

4681259,2,B005FITIGO,"Tell it to me ""as you might to a young child or a golden retriever."" , the business tycoon says to the risk management analyst at a key point in wirter-director J.C. Chandor's ""Margin Call.""

It's a relief to hear the CEO of MBS, John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), want the story of Wall Street's mortgage-backed securities scandal revealed in frank terms. The first half of ""Margin Call"" - a fictionalized, ""inside"" recap of those first days during the 2008 market collapse - is spent with analysts pointing at screens and cursing a corporate blue streak in increasingly strained tones. Here, at last, is clarity.

So the analyst, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) starts his response: ""over the  last 36-40 months the firm has begun  packaging new MBS products that combine  several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security.""

That's Chandor's idea of clarity.

His script swiftly moves to a musical chairs analogy without ever quite explaining the damn thing at the middle of it. Chandor's choice is to vacillate between minute details that are interesting but meaningless - sort of a phony authenticity - and broad analogies featuring crapbags, crapshows, and bridge-building in West Virginia.

In short, no matter what virtues ""Margin Call"" might have, it's a little inane.

Critics lauded Chandor for what he achieved on a small budget, but it's a short-term praise afforded any movie that sticks it to Wall Street. Even in the midst of the movie's crisis moments, Chandor's characters - perhaps excluding Sam Rogers, played by Kevin Spacey - seem awfully impressed with themselves. Or maybe the actors hating their own characters enough to preen through speeches in a way that makes the characters seem ugly. At any rate, ""Margin Call"" plays worse than a documentary on the same subject. You'll certainly learn much less.

It opens with Sam laying off half of the MBS employees on a given floor - including risk management boss Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci). MBS is cold about how it dismisses Eric, who nevertheless manages to slip Peter, his former employee, a disk with some startling analysis on it. After Peter connects all the dots, the data will trigger a fire sale to end all of them.

In a nutshell: Banks approved too many home mortgage loans to too many people who couldn't afford them, under the presumption that, once they jacked up the interest rates on the loans, the ""American Dream"" of owning a home was the kind of responsibility that no soul would dare default on. Banks were wrong. People defaulted. A lot. And since banks had ""projected"" much bigger gains on these mortgages - based on ludicrously high interest rates - than what actually came in, a bubble formed on their value. And the bubble burst. The investments weren't wroth squat.

""Margin Call"" boils that explaination down to Peter, Sam and Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) pointing at a printout, then reporting the news to Jared (Simon Baker) and Sarah (Demi Moore), who have been promoted to their jobs for their looks and ability to prattle on in a sophisticated, empty matter. So they all call John Tuld, who wants to sell everything before the rest of Wall Street finds out what MBS knows.

The climax of ""Margin Call,"" if you will, is whether Sam, the sales floor boss, will deliver a rousing-enough speech for that sale to happen. Since it's Spacey delivering that speech - and few can speechify like Spacey - you can figure it out.

Vagueness looms over the movie like smoke. Maybe that's Chandor's point - numbness. The script is tinged with cynicism and shifts sympathies from Peter - the math whiz who used to be a rocket scientist - to Sam. Quinto, a boring actor, also co-produced, and keeps Peter's emotions buried under his intelligence. Spacey is resurgent in a role that combines venal showmanship and a conflicted conscience. Irons opts for an annoying, caustic Brit vibe.

Chandor has a terrific story; he'd been working in commercial/documentary film for 15 years, banged out the ""Margin Call"" script in four days between job interviews in Boulder, Colo. Chandor's dad worked in investment banking, so his access to the interior lives of those people should have been good. And Academy Award voters clearly agreed; his script was nominated for an Oscar.

But Chandor doesn't play fair. When a character asks for plain talk, he's asking on behalf of the audience. When the response is muddled and technical - and the rest of the movie is, too - it's a dodge. Artful, yes. - but a still a dodge. ""Margin Call"" prefers to be admired better than understood.

It is the way of handing people their pink slip. It's an assembly line that is efficient  and cold. It is a human slaughterhouse in action.

That is how this film starts, a man is being laid off after so many years. The Human Resources executive doesn't have a sympathetic ear, a kind word, or even a warm smile.  When the victim (played by Stanley Tucci), tells her that there is some important project he was completing, she dismisses his concern. His message could be that she is on a sinking ship and she doesn't know the gravity of her own situation. In fact, that is what he was indirectly trying to tell her. He could only tell it to a now former colleague to whom he passes a jump drive, just before the elevator door closes on him and his career.

By early evening the colleague installs the drive and looks at his work.  The numbers don't lie. The company is on the verge of imminent financial disaster. He makes a call summoning people back to work which eventually reaches up the entire chain of command to the C.E.O. It is now late at night, and decisions have to be made, decisions that will bankrupt the firm or sucker other investors to ensure the company's survival.

A number of characters come into play here, the one who is fired, the ones who will be fired, the one who will be blamed, the one who will make the decision, and the one who will abide by it because--he needs the money.

This suspenseful film takes place over the course of one day, from morning to morning. What makes it work besides a fine cast is that you are pretty certain you know the outcome, but you, and forgive me for saying so, don't want to ""buy"" the outcome.

You can hedge your bet that you will be entertained, but perhaps not in a pleasing way. This film is a dose of reality in the way business is conducted. It is ruthless, heartless and is only interested in Profit Resources, not Human Resources. It shows that these people can be robbers, eager to pull the trigger on loyal employees or investors who trusted them. The firm may give knowledgeable people a chilling reminder of Goldman Sachs, and how they treated their investors.

Zachary Quinto, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bethany, Demi Moore, and Jeremy Irons are the cast that makes the financial meltdown of 2008 a taut thriller under the direction of J. C. Chandler. During that night, while the rest of us slept or went about our business of an honest day's labor, many others were burning the midnight oil in bringing on the worst financial disaster in 70 years.

4681263,3,B005FITIGO,"I loved the New York urban scenes at night.  Good acting.  I'm sorry to say I got so bored that I fast-forwarded through some of the middle section. The primary problem addressed was that this financial company was over-leveraged and how that affected the employees.  The primary action of the story is seeing who gets fired and who doesn't and then watching them carrying their belongings from their office outside the building. People who have been fired from their jobs can relate to this story--I guess.

However, I think this film has historical significance.  It is a visual interpretation of the Wall Street mess during the last few years.  Now that we know that this industry has bounced back bigger than ever, it makes the CEO's (played by Jeremy Irons) languid attitude toward his firm's big problem of being over-leveraged seem correct, even though in the film, his coolness and composure towards the problem at hand seems like indifference bordering on corruptness.  The scene I liked best was when the Kevin Spacey character hugged his dog. The dog should have been nominated for an Oscar for making us believe he was dying.  I also watched the director/writer narration version on the DVD, but I'm sorry to say I fell asleep in the middle of it.

I might also add that I have worked in the downtown NYC financial industry during which I also had to drink coffee continually to stay awake.

4681269,3,B005FITIGO,"Most of us know about the 2008 Wall St. meltdown, few of us understand it. Going into this movie, which is based on a true story, I expected to be educated somewhat in Wall St. lingo and come away knowing what MBS (Mortgage backed securities) are and, how they ended up being integral in bringing down an entire industry. Sadly, I came away knowing as much as when I went in.

The movie is slow paced and focus is liberally scattered between the key players. A day of firings, at the financial securities firm, sees one who is exiting hand over a thumb drive to an upcoming newer guy with the parting words ""Be careful"". The thumb drives holds a financial model that heralds the impending doom of the company due to overexposure in the MBS market. High level meetings figure it's time to start dumping those securities and a crazy day of selling worthless securities ensues.

That's basically it. There are one or two points where the characters discuss the ethics surrounding the knowledge that they are indeed selling junk in an attempt to lower their own risk (Save their own a$$es). Buyer beware ? Who knows the games played on Wall St. But, take Wall St. out the picture and apply the same logic to any situation and ask yourself, what would YOU knowingly do to save your self?

It's a cutthroat/competitive world and, in the world of high finance, I'm sure the scale of competitiveness has higher numbers on it.

The movie is 1hr and 42 minutes and, seems to end way too abruptly. We don't get into the aftermath of the day of trading and the viewer is left wondering, ok, what was all that about?

Personally, I feel this movie should have been longer. A summary of the mechanics of the MBS securities would have been very helpful along with at least 20 minutes spent showing us the aftermath of the day of trading. The constant overtone is impending doom on a grand scale yet, I wasn't sure why? It hadn't been explained to me why these men were so in fear for the world. I felt I didn't learn anything useful but, overall, I enjoyed the movie for the sake of the movie.

Spacey, as always, is brilliant, Jeremy Irons, again, brilliant and the other cast members were as good as they needed to be. It's a somewhat dark movie and there is little, if any, lighter moments.

Irons played the role of a CEO of an investment firm and you could feel the power of the character he played. His scenes were show stopping. His acting is worthy of an academy award. Paul Bettany also did an excellent job in his character as an investment floor supervisor. It was a change up for him in roles and it showed why he is such a good and powerful actor.

The script was the next pleasant surprise. I was expecting a movie that was going to bash the Wall Street People but instead it was a thoughtfully well scripted movie showing the ordinary lives of people who got caught up in the meltdown. There was no right or wrong or Democrat/Republican ""stuff"". Just a story of how part of the meltdown happened, how some investment people dealt with it and how it affected parts of their personal lives. In essence this was ""A day in the life of"" type of movie that was incredibly well acted by a heavy weight cast (and there were lots of them).

Just like the 2008 stock market crash, Margin Call (2011) seemingly came out of nowhere and surprised the hell out of me. When I first saw the trailer, this movie got on my radar and I anxiously awaited it's release. To my surprise, it ended up surpassing all of my other highly anticipated films from the Fall of 2011. This is simply one of the best films of 2011...or any year.

Written and directed by J.C. Chandor, Margin Call is a stunning feature film debut. Chandor's screenplay is so sharply and intelligently written, that I immediately compared this film to Oscar winning scribe Aaron Sorkin's super smart The Social Network (2010). This movie is just as current, as relevant, and as snappy as that highly regarded film. I love both movies. They're both perfect in my eyes. Margin Call is the better ""sequel"" to the classic financial thriller Wall Street (1987). While I really like Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), Margin Call is a much better look at the current mindset of the moneymakers in today's stock market, as well as our overall culture.

For many people, this movie won't appeal to them. It demands you to use your brain and look at the darker realities and motivations of investment banks and the people who work in that world. But for those willing to go on the Margin Call ride, and escape into it's point of view, it's a real thriller. I was on the edge of my seat the first time I saw the movie. It just zipped along and kept me fascinated to see what would happen next, even though I intuitively knew where it was gonna ultimately go. But the ensemble cast is so richly fleshed out in each of their roles, that all of the little details of this film had me. Having watched the movie 4 or 5 times now, I keep going back to it over and over because it holds my attention each time.

Ensemble movies like Margin Call live or die with the chemistry and performances of their cast. Fortunately, Chandor has picked a brilliant cast that really came through here. It could be easy for each of these great actors to get lost in the overall story, but each and every single one of them sizzles in their few minutes on screen. There's not really a single protagonist or a single antagonist in this movie. And that's the whole point of the story. It's not black & white. One could argue that Kevin Spacey is the lead actor, but the same argument could be applied to Zachary Quinto. The story is told through the eyes of both, and they both bring some of their best work to it. Supporting actors Paul Bettany, Simon Baker, Jeremy Irons, Penn Badgley, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci each bring fantastic supporting performances, embodying their characters perfectly in my mind. To a degree, they're all criminals and victims in the financial mess that they've created and participated in. And aren't we all really the same, in our own lives? The cause and cure of our successes and failures in life?

The production values in Margin Call far outweigh the reported $3.4 million budget that it was made for. Chandor assembled a fantastic team that really brought their A-game to this project. Shot mostly on a Red One digital cinema camera, along with some footage shot on a Canon 5D and 35mm film, the cinematography by Frank G. DeMarco is beautifully saturated, well composed, and presents New York City as well as any film before it. I highly recommend you watch this movie on blu-ray to fully appreciate it.

While the production design by John Paino might get overlooked, every detail of this claustrophobic movie is well executed. Supposedly, the interior building scenes were all shot on a single floor of this building, so the production design team did a great job reallocating space to serve multiple functions.

Two of the most important aspects of this film are the music and the editing. They go hand in hand, like on most movies. Editor Pete Beaudreau cut this feature down to the bone, leaving just enough material to tell the story in an interesting way, but not too much to weigh it down. The tone and pace are spot on. The original music score by Nathan Larson is reminiscent of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' superb work on The Social Network. It has a buzzing, clicking and edgy beat to it, helping push forward the dialogue and ideas presented by the cast. It really brings an emotional core to the film that might not otherwise come through. It's a subtle emotional core, but there nonetheless. I also really enjoyed the vocal piece ""Wolves"" by Phosphorescent. It leant the perfect tone to the scene where actor Zachary Quinto discovers the problem with the complex financial equation.

At its core, Margin Call is a small, handcrafted indie film catered to a niche audience. It does it's job perfectly. And if you're willing to get into this story and relate to the characters, I think you'll find the payoff that we all look for from our investments in movies.",1329609600,2,4931,4.632723112128146

4681275,2,B005FITIGO,"Margin Call, 2011 film

The movie begins with a time-lapse photo of lower Manhattan, the financial center of America. Grim-faced people leave their offices carrying their belongings in a cardboard box. Another down-sizing? A young woman walks around checking names on a list. Most people are being ""transitioned"" from their company. They can take their personal belongings, their access is revoked. [No warnings at all? It's always best to keep very little of your personal belongings at your office.] A man's phone doesn't work either. The manager talks to the survivors. Later he grieves over his sick dog. [Harry Truman said if you want a true friend in Washington buy a dog.] One office worker gets a surprise when viewing his computer and calls his co-worker. ""Look at this!"" A projected loss greater than the value of the company? The top manager is called at 11pm!

They learn about the projection of volatility. Can they find Eric Dale? There is a meeting with upper management, they look over the reports. There is a problem. It can't be hidden! Can the figures be verified? These Mortgage Backed Securities were popular, but increased risk in case of decreased value. [Were they examples of fraud?] The top manager is there because of his judgment in predicting the future. Can they avoid big losses? By selling to suckers at the current fair market value price! Will they ever trust them again? ""Remember this day."" Will somebody have to take the blame for their problem? Who else? Eric Dale reminisces about a bridge built 22 years earlier. Will he come back.? Who will be let go next? Does the cigarette smoking symbolize their unhealthy actions? ""Is it the right thing to do?"" [The story has slow spots.] Eric Dale returns to the office! The guys below take the blame.

There is a meeting about unwinding the assets of the company by liquidating its holdings of fixed-income MBS today. There is a promised big bonus for this fire sale. They unload big blocks as soon as possible, taking losses. Sam wants out. The top manager mentions the dates of previous crashes and depressions since the 18th century. Sam will stay, he needs the money. Will there be new opportunities in getting out of this mess? Sam's dog died. [Does digging the grave symbolize self-punishment?]

This is not as dramatic (or educational) as Oliver Stone's 1989 movie ""Wall Street"". This seems like a lower budget production (filmed at night). It really doesn't educate the viewer about the swindling in the Wall Street Jungle that caused the implosion that caused the worst economic depression in seventy years. Mortgage Backed Securities were a sophisticated swindle where low-rated mortgages were magically transformed into high-rated mortgages and sold to investors abroad and at home. When people couldn't pay their mortgages (due to low wages and high taxes) they defaulted on payments. This caused the value of MBS securities to crash. [Did this also cause the debt crisis in European countries?] In the 1930s FDR's New Deal passed laws to prevent the swindling that preceded and caused the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Since the 1990s Congress repealed many of the New Deal laws that prevented frauds. Novel financial products were created to swindle investors by hiding the risks. That can't go on forever, and there was a day of reckoning. Overvalued securities plummeted down to their true value and wiped out many investors. Will Wall Street ever learn the value of honesty?",1329523200,,3471,4.969018932874355

My 18 year old son said that he thought the writer really couldn't have been that good if that was all he could come up with.  I have to agree to some degree.  It really was unnecessary.  Having worked around and for and with professional people most of my adult life I have never heard people speak like this, using the F-bomb as one reviewer put it, nearly two to three times a sentence most of the film.

This film throws out the rhetoric and hands you human beings you either love or hate but cannot help but understand their position even if you cannot empathize with it; human, oh so human Nietzsche once wrote.  There are aspects of this film that were obviously lifted from the documentary Inside Job which details exactly what happened in 2008 during the financial meltdown.  Instead of blaming all of the woes on corporations this film extends itself so that we all as a culture are culpable in the values which lead to the collapse.

4681278,5,B005FITIGO,"""Margin Call"" is an impressive feature debut by director J.C. Chandor, who also wrote the film, drawing on the experiences of his friends and of his father, who was a trader at Merrill Lynch as his son was growing up. This film follows the turmoil inside a New York investment bank in 2008, over a period of about a day, as the bank's executives learn that their holdings of mortgage-backed securities are well outside acceptable volatility bands, a situation that could wipe out the bank's entire value if it doesn't unload the securities first. Chandor seems to draw on the recent histories of Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs in constructing this fly-on-the-wall drama of critical events in the biggest crisis in Wall Street history.

Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), analyst at a New York investment bank, finishes work on a risk analysis project that his recently laid-off boss, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), had begun. Alarmed by what he finds, Peter asks his friend Seth (Penn Badgley), a junior analyst, and the Head of Trading Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) to come in after hours to take a look. The company's holdings of mortgage-backed securities have become disturbingly volatile, which, combined with excessive leverage, will soon put the bank's very existence at risk. Sufficiently frightened by Peter's numbers, Will calls the man in charge of the floor, Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), who in turn calls his boss and on up the chain to CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), who must decide whom and what to save.

John Tuld is obviously inspired by Dick Fuld, former CEO of Lehman Brothers. His actions resemble some of the speculation about Goldman Sachs' behavior in 2008. The film is almost voyeuristic in its perspective on how these people act in crisis. There are a variety of personalities at the bank, most of whom are going to lose their jobs one way or another. I imagine that different audiences will take different things away. I found ""Margin Call"" generally sympathetic toward the bankers, traders, and analysts. It does not address how they got into this predicament, which is where their real failure lies. It focuses on how they get out of it -but without explaining that they have little choice but to act in the interest of shareholders, even if they weren't averse to destroying themselves.

These men have only bad choices. They can either do something that looks an awful lot like fraud, or they can wipe out their shareholders, burden the taxpayer, and freeze the credit markets, creating countless more casualties. J.C. Chandor could have been harder on them, and he could have been more sympathetic. By choosing a middle road, he may leave a large part of the audience unsatisfied. I admire him for being authentic rather than dogmatic, though. Seth acts as a kind of tour guide for the audience. A junior analyst in his first job and first crisis, he keeps asking people how much money they make. I enjoyed the compelling characters and dialogue and the look behind the scenes. And, far from profligate itself, ""Margin Call"" was made for an amazing $3.5 million.

The DVD (LionsGate 2012): Bonus features include 2 deleted scenes with commentary, several short items, and an audio commentary. ""Revolving Door: Making Margin Call"" (6 min) interviews the director and cast about the script and its structure -the film follows one piece of information as it moves up the chain of command. ""Missed Calls: Moments with Cast & Crew"" (1 min) is some very brief behind the scenes footage. ""From the Deck: Photo Gallery"" (4 min) is a slide show of production stills. The audio commentary by writer/director J.C. Chandor and producer Neal Dodson discusses locations, structure of the film, performances, character motivations, and sources of information. It's generally a constant commentary. Subtitles available for the film in English, Spanish.",1328832000,,3861,5.009345794392523
4681279,5,B005FITIGO,"Apparently reviewers (found here) critical of this film were looking for a Gordon Gecko ""Wall Street"" redux in ""Margin Call"". Instead of the fantasy which is ""Wall Street"" they got the reality which is this film - and they prefer to be bamboozled.

Having worked on Wall Street and for Lehman Brothers, I can assure the prospective viewer that ""Margin Call"" is a realistic depiction of reality. The film probably is frustrating for viewers who have no idea what an ""MBS"" is (mortgage-backed-security), or a ""sub-prime mortgage"", nor what was at stake in the crisis 24 hour period that this film treats. So let me help those of you thinking about viewing this film...

""Margin Call"" attempts to deal with the first 24 hours wherein Lehman Brothers, Inc. came to grips with the reality that their massive holdings in mortgage backed securities was a house of cards about to topple. At stake here is not piddling issues like the bankruptcy of a mere car company like General Motors, but an investment brokerage company whose default could precipitate a world wide financial collapse. Ignorant reviewers who find this film ""dull"" and ""boring"" have no idea there are watching actors portray persons - just a tiny handful of persons - who are aware that their decisions and actions within a 24 hour period could make or break Western Civilization. The persons portrayed had no idea that the United States government would eventually intercede with billions in bail out money (not to save Lehman Brothers, but with the purpose to contain further damage).

 Someone describing this film as dull, is like someone describing as dull the decision making and dialogue within the White House during the Cuban Missile crisis.

Buy this movie and enjoy it. If you don't grasp what's going on, then educate youself about the facts before viewing it. Don't make a fool of youself by blaming the film producers.",1328400000,4,1893,4.921630094043887

4681283,5,B005FITIGO,"The movie ""Margin Call"" depicts the events that immediately preceded the Financial Crisis in 2008 within a nameless Investment Bank. What I like especially about the movie is the fact that it doesn't try to explain the technical causes of the Financial Crisis but the psychological causes - human failures, which are the real cause for the Crisis: greed, egotism, ignorance. Many scenes in this movie deal with very little dialogue, instead the body language and the unique atmosphere speaks for itself. The ensemble is just brilliant, especially Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons.

Zachary Quinto (""Star Trek"") is initially at the center of the plot as Sullivan and performs well enough in the constraining, semi-heroic role, but the veterans really stand out here beginning with Kevin Spacey, who effectively plays against type as Sam Rogers, a genuine company man, the seen-it-all head of the trading team who rallies what's left of the trading floor with corporate brio but then faces his own cross to bear struggling to commandeer a fire sale of worthless assets dumped on unsuspecting clients. The other standout is Jeremy Irons, who masterfully resuscitates the cool cunning of his Claus von Bulow from ""Reversal of Fortune"" as the acerbically survivalist CEO John Tuld. He handily controls the boardroom scene with cutting humor and hostile precision. One of the film's more pleasant surprises is Demi Moore in cool, brisk form as Sarah Robertson, the top risk officer and lone female executive who knows her career is at stake with the discovery of this folly. Tucci is excellent in his smallish role as Dale and gets to show off his resigned character's engineering aptitude with a brief monologue about building a bridge.

Not sure how the film will perform commercially, given the material is esoteric. If you're a film buff (and enjoy great performances) or you've been in finance, this is a must-see. Other may likely pass.",1328140800,3,1933,5.0754716981132075

4681285,5,B005FITIGO,"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer...I heard that somewhere. That's what ""Margin Call"" is (mostly) about, and the profound arrogance of corporate greed is well examined, especially by Jeremy Irons' slimy performance. I've read some of the other reviews, some not very favorable, but I was never bored; rather, I found it compelling. This is a film about integrity, either lost or on the fence, and what corporate greed can do to otherwise fine people.

Some comedian once said ""Life is all about ass...either kissing it or getting kicked in it"". ""Margin Call"" gives a bit of insight into some talented men who have lost focus on their humanity. It's more about attitudes than the actual events that are being portrayed.
One of the most profound scenes was between Spacey, looking for closure, talking to Irons, pigging out on a steak dinner, smug that he made another billion at the expense of the little guys.

Certainly, the ensemble cast of pros is impressive. Spacey and Quinto were particularly fine, but Irons takes the prize. I genuinely hated him. Demi Moore, too, is not to be dismissed. Too bad the fine Mary McDonnell appeared too briefly. She's got class. I'm sure much of her part was cut, since she has almost top billing.

We see that they're people who are, for the most part, highly paid to the extent of taking their incomes for granted, coldly calculating, and lacking a moral compass.  In the end, it's about putting their personal interest above that of others, regardless of who might be harmed, provided that no laws are apparently being broken.

It lets you see how these characters deal with the conflict between following a strict ethical path and practically ensuring your own demise, or bending the rules so that you and your company may have a chance to survive. While many of us would prefer the ideal protagonist to self sacrifice and do the ethical thing, would would a real person do when their way of life, their paycheck is on the line?

4681291,3,B005FITIGO,"This movie has a superb cast, and a compelling topic, but unfortunately for me it fell flat, because the writing was too labored and the pacing too slow. The film focuses on one night at a fictional investment firm when it's discovered by a young analyst that with the firm's current holdings, their projected losses far exceed the total valuation of the firm - in other words, it's all about to fall apart, ala 2008. It's a tight drama, spanning about 36 hours, with most of the scenes taking place inside the offices of the firm, as the various players struggle to come to terms with this reality, what to do (or not do) about it, and what it means for them. The players include Stanley Tucci as a middle manager specializing in risk assessment who develops the model highlighting the issues, but is let go before he can complete them; Kevin Spacey as a higher level manager, the only one to show anything close to a human heart; Demi Moore as a cold Risk Management VP; Jeremy Irons as an even colder head of the company; and Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto and Penn Badgley as various underlings involved.

Part of the problem for me is that the financial issues involved are all left very vague, so this isn't a film you will learn much from. It is meant to be more focused on the individuals involved, and the ethical dilemmas they faced (or didn't, as many aren't worried about much more than their own skins.) But the only individual that seems even close to three-dimensional is Keven Spacey - the rest are stereotypes. So it doesn't work as an emotional drama, because there isn't much emotion. The dialogue often feels very labored and false - you'd think there would be a little more confusion and anger on a night like this. Everyone also shows up for a crises meeting at 2am in full suits without a hair out of place, which seems a little labored as well. So we don't really get a new perspective on the crises, and we don't really get pulled into the inner lives of these characters either, so what's the point?

Kevin Spacey heads the cast as a middle man who grapples with the morality of selling out at the cost of so many other companies' very existence.

It's a grimly keen assessment of Capitalism; a lovely little tragic-comedy full of lonely figures in business suits trying to hold on to as much of their money as possible. All the business-world jargon that confuses most of us in real life sputters out of the lips of the characters in this movie with irony: half the time no one knows exactly what is meant by ""volatility index"" and the like.

Some variation in the swearing might have helped; these young men would certainly have had bigger arsenals of curses. Jeremy Irons had the longest speeches, if one could call them that, but he's been hamming it up for so long now that he can chew the scenery without saying a word, and he did that too.

I was in this den of thieves for a while and Margin Call doesn't even come close to telling the truth. Tuld is clearly a play on Lehmann's Dick Fuld, and he takes a few light knocks, but writer/director Chandor lets the whole bunch off way too easy. Goldman was the worst but all the WS slimers knew exactly how crooked those mortgage tranches were, and that it would all collapse sooner or later. They also knew they'd get bailed out for being ""too big to fail""...after they let Lehmann go down in flames first. Oh, and they shorted their own damned and doomed-to-fail recommendations.

Nothing too criminal there. Just the moneylenders back in the temple...

This movie conveniently sidesteps all of that with vague references to ""warnings a year ago"", and in the end nobody really plays the villain, when almost all of them were. Add the soft-pedaling of the enormity of these crimes to the often glacially slow pace of this flick and you've got a pretty bad trade.

Plus there are soooo many looooong scenes of guys gazing out the window meaningfully as the foreboding music heralds the looming disaster; that's grade-school tension-building and it just makes this film harder to sit through as it goes.

Denby calling this the best Wall Street movie ever made is a joke and a half; the first Wall Street blows it out of the water in every single way. There are some decent performances here, especially Quinto, Baker, Spacey and Irons, but Stone grasped the Street's inherent criminality in way that Chandor refuses to. Predictably: his father was a trader at Merrill for four decades. Thus we get the ""blameless"" traders here, just following orders.

But there was no Nuremburg for WS in 2008, was there? Hell, even the king scumbag whore Lloyd Blankfein sneered and laughed at the feds and was allowed to walk scot-free, and he was the worst criminal of them all, no mean feat. Still is. But Bush and Obama are bought and paid for by these crooks, and we all just laugh and say, ""Oh well, what can you do?""

Well, you can throw the lot of them in jail, for starters. And you can make art that really shows what's going on. Instead, we get this weak pablum that people call ""hard-hitting"". Uh huh. Hard hitting is exploring how many millions of families these filthy thieves bankrupted, not making us feel sorry about their ""tough decisions"". Hard hitting would also be taking a closer look at how viciously bloated the derivatives market still is, as we approach the next, much much worse crash. Hohoho, like that's going to happen. Hold on tight...

The only really good films about the Mortgage Tranche Scam so far are documentaries; let's hope someone makes a semi-fictional version a heck of a lot tighter and more honest than this insipid WS-approved commercial for sharing blame, blame that can be laid very accurately at a few feet.",1326758400,6,2857,4.7114228456913825
4681300,3,B005FITIGO,"As a non-financially savvy layperson who reads widely and tries to understand what's actually going on in the world, I grasp better than the common Joe how deregulation and high-stakes gambling infected Wall Street, resulting in a global financial meltdown. Still, I was confused by the tradingspeak on which the events depicted in this movie depend. Paradoxically, the plot about the dire meltdown emergency and the based-on-true company's ""survival"" response was so plodding that I noticed several times that I was bored with it.

It started out promising enough, with heads being surgically chopped off by the greedy, ruthless corporate axe. We get a palpable glimpse into the high-stress world of Wall Street trading as well as its utter emptiness. Back-stabbing and ironies abound, and some pictures are worth a thousand words&mdash;like the honcho coming in to shave in the company bathroom in the pre-dawn hours before the sell-off where the underling trader, who has been loudly weeping in a stall, tries to put on the emblematic wooden professional mask while being inhumanely ignored. But the sell-off happens too quickly for its scope and devastation to be appreciated, and the consequences to the global financial system and the ""little people"" of Main Street go unexplored.

I did get a clue as to why real-world traders at post-bailout financial institutions were paid outrageous bonuses for failure. This did not elicit any sympathy on my part for the traders, however, because this movie makes it clear that generosity on the part of ""Mac the Knife"" corporate heads and the honoring of commitments to employees are nonexistent on Wall Street. (On the contrary, this solidified my sense that, in the real world, they are all in-cahoots greedy bastards.)

When the pivot point in the movie arrives, and we are ready for some retrospective analysis, it abruptly ends. This left me feeling like a bucket of cold water had been poured over my head. Was that the point? Kevin Spacey, as always, delivers, but the ending was just plain weird. What was that? A metaphor for his integrity or (unbelievable) naivete sacrificed on the altar of vulture capitalism?",1326672000,,2168,5.11864406779661
4681301,5,B005FITIGO,"I consider ""Margin Call"" a riveting and credible drama about a fateful 24 hours at an investment firm on the eve of the 2008 financial meltdown.

What really grabbed me is the quality of both the acting and the script.

The cast is composed of nothing but heavy-hitters, and they're all at the top of their game here.  Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, and Simon Baker all turn in brilliant, natural performances.

The script was written by the first-time director, whose own father was a long-time Merrill Lynch employee let go during the downturn.

The DVD has special features including a director's commentary and a few deleted scenes and a brief making-of featurette.

I was struck by the director's comment in the making-of featurette that he tried not to make judgments about the characters in this piece, but I have to assume that the audience will make plenty of judgments about these overpaid and under-principled traders.

Take the Spacey character, who isn't the slightest bit nonplussed when he has to lay off half of his staff, but who is reduced to tears when his dog is dying.  As the firm's glamorous but unscrupulous CEO, Jeremy Irons also makes a chilling and effective pitch to keep the Spacey character at the firm after they succeed in selling off their most toxic assets to unsuspecting customers.

I also admired a remarkable scene in an elevator when two of the senior partners are talking in code about the events of the day while a cleaning woman stands between them with her cleaning cart, trying to block out their drama with a smile of inoffensive submission on her face.

In its quiet and effective way, ""Margin Call"" shows what's wrong with our society -- and what's right when an art form shines a light on our greed and corruption.  Highly recommended.",1326585600,,1837,4.818471337579618

4681303,4,B005FITIGO,"Seriously, would you trust these people with your life savings?

Margin Call emphasizes the fact that we don't have as much control over our own investment decisions as we would like to think. There are those of us who have to follow the rules and then there are those who abuse the system, pushing it to and over the brink of disaster. It isn't possible to look at investing quite the same after watching it from the inside. The rules are for the little guys. The big guys will make money one way or another. I certainly would not have wanted to be on the other side of that final phone call.

It made me want to go bury my savings in a coffee can in the back yard.

Actors are excellent. There was more than the average amount of profanity. Good scenery in the few instances where they stepped out of the office for a few minutes.

It was a depressing reminder of how things are and why we can never again really trust a system that is this badly out of control.",1326499200,,964,4.2228260869565215
4681304,3,B005FITIGO,"""Margin Call"" is basically the story of a mythical Wall Street firm (that bears more than a passing resemblance to Lehman Brothers) at the beginning of the 2008 financial melt-down. It opens with the Firm laying off most of its middle managers in ruthless fashion. It quickly develops that the firm has recklessly invested in mortgage derivative products and is about to incur losses that will destroy it utterly. This develops with a reasonable amount of tension, but it is hard to make a movie exciting when the most dramatic moments are of a bunch of actors staring at a computer screen showing financial projections. There are a lot of scenes of executives looking at the numbers and dropping the F-bomb.

This is an interesting movie and pretty true-to-life. Demi Moore, not usually a favorite of mine, plays to perfection her role as the Firm's risk management executive (whose negligence was key in destroying the firm.) The rest of the cast turns in pretty authentic performances and deserve kudos.

Overall, this film comes together pretty well and highlights some aspects of the recklessness that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Worth watching. RJB.",1326499200,,1161,5.010362694300518

""So that we may survive."" Of course, as we know, from our own meltdown that the manipulators come out of it all, well compensated. They even can claim losses to the IRS. Humorously one trader claimed $76,500 for hookers and booze as an entertainment deduction. The scene of our traders looking down from their high rise roof top to the city street below revealed people as ants which is symbolic of the morality of capitalism - it's all about faceless competition, nothing else matters but to survive - wealthy. There was only token brief allusion to the moral variable surrounding the human cost of self-serving greed which, coincidentally, is more than one hears in the real world financial media of CNBC where's it's casually dismissed as the rightful reward of value added capitalism and sarcastically often pointed out that the ants should be grateful for the opportunity to dispose of the crumbs.",1326153600,,1689,4.8477508650519034
4681310,5,B005FITIGO,"Having watched Too Big To Fail (TBTF), The Last Days of Lehman Brothers (LD) and Margin Call (MC) over a relatively short time, I am now catching up on my reviews.

From 2002-2007 I worked for a Wall Street Firm in Mortgage Capital.  I offer this as a source of perspective.

I have a very good friend who worked in what can be best described as a very senior back office capacity re: mortgages, on the West Coast.  He recently watched the movie and thought that it was badly paced and that the script didn't do enough with the star studded ensemble cast.  I respectfully disagree.  IMHO, what makes this movie great is that it took a large number of recognizable actors and placed them all in one dimensional roles.  What is this you say, one dimensional roles don't often make for a good movie?  In this movie and with such a large cast, the risk is that actors will often step out of their respective roles in an effort to get marquis billing, which can result in both over playing their role and a highly uneven telling of the story. What is great here is that no one actor outperforms the other.

Having sat on a trading floor for 5+ years, so much of what was portrayed rang true:

1.) The method by which employees are terminated.  At my firm they did things slightly different.  Those that were to be let go were called to a meeting in a conference room, while those that were retained were given a private audience where a retention agreement was offered.  Some firms did actually escort you out of the building, though the image of walking out the door with a box of your personal belongings in highly accurate

2.) The confused looks of management when they were shown the conclusions reached by the current risk model.  It is important to note that in most situations the models that are written to both book P&L and manage risk are developed by ""quant's"" and that Sales & Trading may at best have a limited understanding of the underlying assumptions.  The more senior management, the less likely the understanding.  This was portrayed brilliantly in MC

3.) The military like ""sacrificial lambs"".  The difference being that the pain involved in falling on one's ""sword"" is somewhat dulled by fairly generous termination packages.  I have personally born witness to this

4.) When the decision was made exit the business by being first out, despite the large losses.  This was not in the film for dramatic effect.  When things were imploding, the general philosophy was that the first loss is the best loss!

I personally liked the scene where the Paul Bettany character is standing on the roof with the 2 junior guys while giving an accounting of how he spent his bonus.  I also thought that the scene where the Sales Manager (Kevin Spacey) called a meeting of the sales staff where he essentially said you are all gone at the end of the day and while I realize that you will be jeopardizing both your professional integrity and future employability, we will pay you each ""$XXX"" million if you unload ""XXX"" of the firm's positions by EOB.  Subsequently, watching the Paul Bettany character starting the day selling in the 90's and ending in the 60's was chilling.  I mean how would you like to be that trader that bought 30-points high in the beginning of the trading day!

I do admit that MC might appeal more to people that have some connection to the industry and have tried for years to explain to friends and family both what the work environment was like and what we actually did for a living!  In this respect, my 5* rating is biased.  However, with that said, if you give MC a chance, the payoff will be there.",1326067200,,3632,4.560185185185185
4681311,4,B005FITIGO,"This movie was far from perfect, as it missed some critical opportunities to educate the viewer, nonetheless is worth watching fro several reasons:
The characters are well crafted from both the business perspective and the technical perspective. many of characters were just forced in into a set of actions that quickly became out of their control as the true magnitude of the mess became apparent.

2 of the technical people ( Quinto and Tucci's roles) were shown in their native form, they way they viewed their world in an engineering mind set. Quinto's character is particularly naive that felt real.

Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Iron's characters as veterans really exposed a seamy side of the whole meltdown business, in that they had no real idea how any of the trading worked in Mortgage backed securities worked in terns of the risks. It was classic as they then had to figure out how to unwind their mess and what i meant for all of banking.

Demi Moore's character was way too weak, but maybe that just reflected reality.

The way all of the traders and salesmen found a way to justify their terrible actions was a great short view into how easy it is engage in self-delusion in order to feel better about your self. The last scene of Jeremy Irons filling in a cross word puzzle in the executive dining room is classic.

The downside of the film fell in two areas, at the key executive meeting, many acronyms were used that assumed the viewer would know, they should have found a way to fill the audience in, especially when all they had to do was associate MBS with Mortgage Backed Securities. way too much implied understanding, especially when they threw around the definition of SWAPs as something no to do. When Quinto's character was explaining the model's failures to his colleague and later with Spacey doing this for Irons, it would have helped to show he graphs they were referring to. Especially since not many people would equate ""volatility"" to a concept relating to market ""trouble"".

when you think about the fact that Both of Dan Brown's Novels/ movies had all of the action take place in 24 hours, and this movie also had all action take place in 24 hours, it represents an interesting contrast in styles. In the case of this movie, the effects are still being felt and it would have been worthwhile making the dilemma a little clearer.",1326067200,,2360,4.702179176755448
4681312,4,B005FITIGO,"Kudos to J.C. Chandor for writing and directing this remarkable film, which never patronizes its audience or demonizes its subjects -- the men (and a few women) who traded mortgage-backed securities in the days leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Chandor recognized that these traders and sales people and their colleagues provided legitimate human drama, and that their actions raised worthwhile questions about fairness, and how we should respond if asked to hurt others, or to make personal sacrifices for the survival of a company that would make no sacrifice for us.

(Spoilers below)

As the story unfurled and the immensity of the crisis became apparent to management, I expected a by-the-numbers thriller in which evil management tries to eliminate the nosy underlings who have discovered their dirty secrets.

Nothing like that happens. Mid-level risk manager Zachary Quinto completes an analysis by his boss, Stanley Tucci, and realizes that the firm's survival is threatened by even a small drop in housing prices or increase in price volatility. He immediately calls in his boss, who doesn't at first understand but who is convinced. He escalates the problem. This cycle repeats itself until, with a few hours, the CEO and executive committee of the bank is involved and sets the strategy for the next day's trading.

It's virtually all 100% believable, down to fine touches like the fact that the characters on screen never mention the kind of securities they trade until the problem has been escalated to the CEO's level. In real life they wouldn't need to, as they all worked in the same group and the assets would already have been assumed. The casual way in which the characters discuss money rings totally true. The relationship between the traders and risk managers and management felt right (I work on Wall Street and could tell who held which job on the basis of their behavior long before the script made it clear).

I've only a few minor issues with the film -- first, in real life, if you hold an emergency meeting at 4:00am, not everybody shows up in a perfectly pressed suit, perfectly shaved and/or coiffed. Second, the moral qualms shown by Kevin Spacey weren't quite right. He knew that his traders were going to hurt their customers, and that many of them would be fired soon afterwards, but I can't imagine the real world equivalent of his character worrying that  his employees would be unemployable as a result. In reality, his desk produced results better than any of its competitors by selling earlier, and that track record would add enormous resume value to every member of his team. At one point Zachary Quinto learns how much the head of his trading desk made the year before, and he expresses surprise and populist objections. No part of that felt right.

There was a problem with my copy of the DVD, with brightness levels changing discontinuously about half a dozen times. I don't know if that is a general problem with the mastering or not.

Anyway, an excellent film. I'd give 4.5 stars if I could.",1326067200,,3047,4.891472868217054
4681313,5,B005FITIGO,"The acting is superb- and the story-even if you have to watch the director's commentary to entirely ""get it""- a wonderful indictment- to me, a leftist- of capitalism. ..certainly presented from the capitalists' point of view- the speech that the CEO- Jeremy Iron's character gives- on the history of capitalism? how many of you knew about the recurring collapses? The speech given in the car by the ? character-(the thin blond crew cutted trader)  about how the traders differ from normal people and how much of a scam they are running? fabulous- absolutely nailed it.

How do I know that it is presented from the capitalists' point of view- one- there is no explanation of the hedge funds and bundlings etc that was the cause; 2, there is no explanation of how people get hurt other than these poor, debauched traders, and 3, there is no direction to how we migh change things-which we (perhaps not easily) could- i e- revolutionary, non-violent change to socialism!

4681315,5,B005FITIGO,"This film is clinical and gripping at the same time.  It grabbed me from the beginning.  The scene where the employees are being called in to be sacked hit me in the gut.  Seventeen years ago I was riffed at a blue-chip law firm; rumors had been spreading and I knew I was to be one of them.  It was cold and heartless.  The most experienced and higher-paid employees were let go and we immediately had to clear out our desks and lockers.  I barely had time to run around and say goodbye to friends.  You go through that once and the experience never leaves you even though I was lucky to get a job immediately and I've been retired for several years.  That scene just made me relive that agony all over again.  I now know how my father must have felt being laid off during the Great Depression even though he got a job as a printer and eventually was recalled.  (The war helped him be reinstated; war is good for business, at least it was then.)

Kevin Spacey was amazing in his depiction of a man wrestling with his conscience.  The scene where he is crying over the impending death of his dog also hit home.  I understood that perfectly but it also let you into the character of Sam, a man who feels deeply not only about his dog but about the effects on people of what is about to happen and sends him into a crisis of conscience.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand the implications of what is happening.  I can barely understand high finances but I knew right away what was happening.  This is not a film that is easy to watch; it is also a film that cannot be dismissed.

Spacey's performance is worthy of another Oscar.",1325980800,,1641,4.293159609120521
4681316,4,B005FITIGO,"**Spoiler**
This story is about the first day of the financial collapse of the US banks and market and then the world financial markets.  The movie starts as a massive layoff is being done to let go of 80 percent of the employees of a financial firm. A typical black Monday! One of the middle bosses being let go gives a data chip to his brightest subordinate and tells him to look into the data but to be careful!  What unfolds is the realization that the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) market is about to collapse and drag their company and the world markets down with them.

The management meets all night and decides that their financial future means more to them than honesty and trying to help others.  This is a shockingly terrifying movie about the realities of the USA and global financial markets where a handful of people make millions (Or billions) at the expense of everybody else who invests in the market or saves their money in a bank.

This movie hits the problem head on and shows how the people sold bad securities knowing that the buyers would lose everything so that they could make personal financial gains of millions of dollars in a few hours.  The buyers purchased the securities knowing something was going on but their own greed made them make bad decisions.

I am sorry to have spelled out so much of the plot of the movie but I see the disaster that this kind of thinking caused and that we are still conducting business today with the same rules.  Watch this movie and then decide if you will ever trust a stock broker or firm again.

The continued success and ""got mine"" of those in charge, or supplied with wonderful parachute type packages is semi shocking and norm for upper management officers. Our economic disaster of 2008-2010 is presented in its most naked form via this film as to USA corporate banks. They/we bundled mortgage related products with lower ratings B, BB, BBB, A or even C ratings, coupled with a mathmatical formula the said the odds of them all failing was nearly impossible. So the products got AAA ratings by Moodys and S&P !!!!. Then the banking firms sold trillions to each other, who then borrowed trillions from other firms using these AAA rated products as collaterical.. Then the products freaking failed as housing collapased/jobs lost and people could not pay their mortgages!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When a man who has given 19 years of productive and loyal service,is frog marched out of the office,the staff know many of them will be next. And they are.
The joke however is on the firm. Once whizkid Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto)has accessed his former bosses last project, he is horrified to discover that trading will soon exceed the volatility levels used by the firm to calculate risk. (It's a bit like waiting for Mount Vesuvius to erupt, fallout will be disastrous.)
The head honcho's are called in to try and stem the blood flow,but the greatest irony is that the man they sacked earlier that day,Eric Dale(Stanley Tucci) is not contactable because they (the firm) disconnected his cell phone when they sacked him that same morning !
Throughout the story one can see that not all the key players will still have a job at the end of the trading day - Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore) and Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) occupy similar positions,with Jared having the ruthlessness and ice-water running through his veins so necessary to survive,and he has the ear of the the Managing Director John Tuld (Jeremy Irons). So it is Sarah Robertson who is told to fall on her sword and be the scapegoat - despite her telling Tuld a year earlier that the firm was heading for financial disaster.
In the end Tuld gives the orders to the traders to sell,sell,sell,as soon as trading opens. Their reward is a seven figure sum for selling worthless assets to the people they do business with. I wondered how many of them realised those large sums of money promised,will have to last them a long time - they won't be picked up by their clients because of what they done to them,and their names will be black listed throughout the finance industry.
To cap it all,the film was gripping,with a strong cast led magnificently by Jeremy Irons,and well supported by Kevin Spacey,Stanley Tucci,Zachary Quinto,Simon Baker,Paul Bettany and Demi Moore.
Whilst not without a few (minor) flaws,Margin Call was - like Wall Street before it - a fascinating look inside the corporate world and at how little responsibility (or concern for investors) when through their own poor management,they run the country into enormous debt,causing mass hardship and job losses.",1325721600,,2373,4.9054726368159205
4681320,5,B005FITIGO,"this is not an action film.  those who do not have at least a basic understanding of the U.S. capital markets will more than likely be bored and confused by it.  in other words, the average Obama voter should probably pass this one up and move on to the latest edition of ""Twilight"" or ""Hangover II"".

what this film is, though, is a very interesting analysis of the events that took place at one (fictional) Wall Street brokerage firm in the hours leading up to the market's awakening to the fact that the loose lending practices that led to an over-inflated housing market, and eventually to the meltdown of the U.S. and world financial markets.  it focuses on one 24 hour period at one firm, and in the process gives a good thumbnail summary of how the market collapse began.  it is also a fascinating study in human behavior and what drove people to foist what they knew to be worthless paper that spread through our economy like a cancer on unsuspecting buyers throughout the markets. I thought it was a great film, at least as far as it goes in telling the story.  but although I liked the movie and give it 5 stars, it focuses only on one small part of the story - the part that happened AFTER all the damage had already been done.

what's missing is what led the lending institutions to make the bad mortgage loans to begin with. does anyone seriously believe that ""greed"" led mortgage lenders, who had been successfully making and collecting on mortgage loans for 100 years, suddenly begin to loan money to people who never had any intention of paying it back? please. be serious. what's missing is the role that corrupt politicians, mostly Democrats, played in creating the legislation that allowed them to essentially force the mortgage industry into making what they knew at the time were bad loans. what's also missing is how those corrupt politicians (e.g., Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Maxine Waters, etc.) continued to exert pressure on lenders and insist there were no problems at Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, even AFTER they knew there was a huge problem. in addition to the federal government's role, farm teams of the Democrat Party, such as ACORN, were instrumental in using racial blackmail to influence loose mortgage lending policies. neither is there any mention of the role of Obama, who contributed to this mess both in his pre-Senate days as a shady lawyer for ACORN, and then after he was elected to the Senate as a co-conspirator with the rest of his Democrat colleagues. Wall Street has dirty hands to be sure and ""Margin Call"" does an excellent job of explaining how they got their hands dirty, but they didn't start the mess, and they're certainly not alone. There are no good guys in this story. only criminals and cowards.  The actions and inactions of Obama and most others in the Congress qualify them as both.

I thought this film was very interesting in presenting the thought process that led the Wall Street firms and their employees to make the cowardly decisions they did (in fairness, though, how many among us would have had the courage to walk away from millions of dollars for a few hours work when the alternative was personal financial armageddon and the house of cards was going to come down anyway?), but the movie completely gives a pass to - or, more accurately, completely ignores the role played by - the people who are ultimately accountable for this disaster - the criminals sitting in the Congress and the White House in Washington, D.C., and staffing the offices of groups like ACORN around the country. they are the ones who ultimately brought hell down on our economy. and they're still doing it.",1325635200,,3652,4.702660406885759

4681322,4,B005FITIGO,"The tale of a financial firm that screws up its gargantuan value, sells at a loss and leads America into the 2008 financial crisis. It's a lot more complicated than that in the film but I'm trying to simplify it. There's a very impressive cast set up with this film: Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Zachary Quinto, Paul Bettany, Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker and a cameo at the very end from Marcy McDonnel. Overall, they all deliver a very good or better presentation of their characters. Spacey is the worn out cynic who's too wrapped up in more personal matters to completely care; Moore and Baker play high up rivals trying to survive the fallout; Quinto is the young brain who first discovers the problem; and Irons is the highest of the high who comes down upon the company with a cold precision and dominant authority at the meetings. There's definitely some ethical choices being made here and for the most part the question is brought up as to whether the right thing is being done. There's also a strong showing of disconnectedness to humanity as these people toss around six figure salaries and much higher as if they were tossing about spare change. Junior types, when not wondering if their bosses really make $2M or more a year compared to their 100k+ salaries, wonder what the common people are doing since they have no clue what is going to happen. Few are sympathetic and some seem resentful that they're giving better credit lines to the masses yet being looked down upon for being greedy Wall Street types. There's some truth in most of the statements, especially if you're on that side of the fence. Math nerds will notice Tucci's error in the latter part of the film when he talks about his engineering gig. This film cost about $3.5M to make (most of the big name actors/actresses didn't work for much) and yielded a bit over $10M at the worldwide Box Office.

4681326,4,B005FITIGO,"I really liked MARGIN CALL (dir. J. C. Chandor), but I have to admit I don't really understand it.  The plot revolves around a young risk analyst (Zachary Quinto) who discovers that his investment banking firm has misinterpreted its own equations and is on the verge of total collapse.  What ensues is a night of tension-filled meetings staffed by company higher-ups (Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Demi Moore) and eventually the CEO (Jeremy Irons).  As Irons explains it, they have three choices:  1) be first, 2) be smarter, or 3) cheat.  He rules out cheating, says he can't count on being smarter than anyone else, which leaves him with being first.  So the plan is to dump billions of dollars of unsecured junk on an unsuspecting market, which will save the firm even as it plunges all of Wall Street into chaos.

As someone with no expertise in either economics or investment banking, I found myself struggling to understand exactly what was going down at MBS, the fictionalized Lehman-style investment house portrayed in the film.  Several characters try several times to explain it, but not very effectively.  At one point Jeremy Irons asks Spacey and Quinto to ""explain it as if you're speaking to a child,"" which gave me hope.  But phrases like ""historic volatility levels"" get in the way of making any of this understandable.  I get the overall picture - MBS (like Lehman) was making paper trades backed by worthless mortgages (among other low-rated vehicles) which they were playing off against each other like the proverbial house of cards.  When Quinto discovers the fatal flaw in their statistics, we know it will all come crashing down.  The question is whether MBS will put its own survival above that of its customers (and the American people).

MARGIN CALL is a thrilling film, although it admittedly takes a bit of concentration to keep up with what's going on.  The performances (Irons, Spacey, and Quinto especially) are exceptional, and I have no doubt the film accurately reflects the mood of firms like Lehman that played a major role in the collapse of our economy in 2008.  But this is not a subject matter that easily translates to story - as such, I never found myself really connecting with any of these characters.  One moment - when Spacey embraces his dying dog at the vet's office - stands out as a glimpse of humanity in what is a very cold and merciless world.  I liked that.  It helped me relate to Spacey's character.  However, ultimately Spacey joins the others in a willingness to sell out humanity for cold, hard cash.  The world of MBS (like Wall Street in the ""real world"") is totally fixated on money - making it, holding onto it, and turning it into more money.

There's one nice moment when two characters look out at the people on the streets of Manhattan and wish they could be as innocent of the horror that's about to be unleashed by MBS (and other Wall Street firms).  But Paul Bettany says it best:  ""People wanna live like this in their cars and big [******] houses they can't even pay for. The only reason that they all get to continue living like kings is `cause we got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off and then the whole world gets really [*******] fair really [*******] quickly and nobody actually wants that.""  This is the heart of MARGIN CALL.  We blame the 2008 crash on greedy Wall Street bankers and financiers, but they're only a reflection of the rest of us who want what we can't afford.

MARGIN CALL is a good film, even if I don't understand it as well as I'd like.  It's also a film that will make you think about the world we live in.  I do recommend it.",1325376000,5,3648,4.62111801242236
4681327,3,B005FITIGO,"Don`t be fooled by the reviews -- this is a good film about the 2008 Wall Street crash, not a great one. The main challenge for the director is that he has to keep us engaged even though much of the audience will surely delight in watching a bunch of greedy financial operators try desperately to avoid a meltdown of their firm which was caused by their love of money and disregard for the risks. The problem here is that none of the characters are particularly likeable or so horrifically over-the-top as to be mesmerising. Instead we have a mixture of innocent youth combined with clapped out bosses with a few cynical high-level people flitting through the action. The movie starts strongly -- a young analyst discovers the firm is about to go bankrupt, sparking a series of panicked meetings through the night -- and speeds towards the tipping point. Are the bosses going to take a risk by keeping some very risky assets on board, or are they going to get rid of them in a fire sale, even though this will wreck the firm`s reputation? Without giving too much away, we don`t really care, since we have so little invested in the actors we`re watching. Kevin Spacey does what he can with a script which portrays him as a good-hearted almost honest boss with a weak character and a need for money, yet it isn`t enough. Jeremy Irons half convinces as the chairman, a cynical old Brit who doesn`t give two figs for tradition or what`s right. At the end he and Spacey have an unconvincing discussion about the nature of markets and how even if you started from scratch, the losers and winners would quickly rise to prominence. It doesn`t feel realistic and helps produce a very flat ending. This movie needs more engaging characters.",1325289600,,1730,4.62012987012987
4681328,4,B005FITIGO,"Enjoyed the movie overall.  My only issue is those who were hurt, were not personalized, they are basically invisible.  We know that it is a 'dog eat dog world', but really, everyone at the firm got paid one way or another.  Show the impact of someone losing their business and the impact it has on their family because they trusted one of those treacherous, absolutely immoral bastards.  That makes the movie.  Also, if you are not in the business, I doubt that you would get the overall drift of the movie, a lot of jargon and MBS, really?!? I think a little more bridging information may have helped lay people understand better what was happening.  Even movies like 'Boiler Room' and 'Trading Places' gave you enough information to understand what was happening without an MBA from Wharton.

The cast is pretty impressive and there are some real big names in here - Kevin Spacey, Demi Moore, Zachary Quinto etc. but the plot just seems a bit lacking.  Basically a financial firm ends up in a bad spot financially and needs to find a way out of it - this comes with a huge loss of jobs.  Yes, the film illustrates how the normal man can go from a well paid job to nowhere within a few hours but I don't really see the point to the film - or rather I do I just don't see why they made this film out of such a ""normal"" story.  I'm not after huge special affects but this just seems rather lackluster and for such a star cast I expected a little bit more.  This is probably the worst review in history as I don't know what to say - the cast are good, the acting is good but the story line is well urgh.

For a movie trying to 'capitalize' on the 2008 meltdown (oh the irony), it sure doesn't say much about what actually happened and it doesn't bother dramatizing it with fiction either.

This has to be the one of the most lightweight movies I've ever seen. Probably the Wall Street version of '2012'.

4681335,1,B005FITIGO,"A movie on the financial crisis could be really interesting, educational and an overall good movie.  This movie certainly had all the right actors to make such a movie.  However, it fails in a big way.  Don't waste your money or time by renting it.

This movie was just boring--REALLY boring.  It didn't explain the financial crisis. Having read several books on the subject, I understand the crash (at least for a layman). I doubt that anyone who saw this movie would walk away enlightened or understanding the issues that led to it.  They never explain anything about the crash.  All you see is that a big wallstreet firm is overleveraged and is about to dump a bunch of stuff. They don't explain what's being dumped, why its being dumped, why the 'volatility' is happening...nothing. They made a movie on the crash and I'm not sure they ever even used the term 'subprime' in it.  That should tell you how little this movie explains the crash.

The entire thing is laced with a class warfare overtone via one character who's only purpose in the film is to say, 'how much do you think so-and-so makes?' throughout the film.  Ok..we got the point.  Wallstreeters earn a lot of money.  We knew that going into the film so why beat it to death?

In case that wasn't boring enough, half of the rest of the film is filled with silent panning scenes of everything from the NYC skyline to the streets to rooms of traders. The occasional silent, panning scene can be profound in a movie.  Silent panning scenes every 5 minutes in a film just suggests a lack of decent dialogue and space/time fillers.

If you removed all the silent scenes and all of the scenes of little discussions about how much wallstreeters make, it would make no impact on the story but there would only be about half-hour of film left.

Hopefully someone else will make a movie on this subject.  The book, The Big Short, would make a good movie.

I rated this very good movie 5 stars ""not"" because it was completely stellar in delivery - but because it nailed everything I have observed happening in the market over the years - things I had difficulty believing at the time, and because I did not believe it, lived to rue the day I did not take heed of what I suspected to be the truth.  And that is that none of these people at the top really know what is transpiring out there in their Never, Never Land of electronic trading; they don't understand the ramifications of their ""leaps and straddles"", "" butterflies and compound derivatives leverage"" because they never had to;  and rely entirely on underlings that don't, for the most part have a good understanding either; that silence is bought, used and trod on as long as is practical;  and that financial instruments the world markets depend on (and the individual investor who has been sold the biggest bill of goods) are knowingly spun out of thin air and kept circulating in a round-robin tail chasing scenario that catches the tail up to the head every decade or so.  There is no incentive to correct, because the Piper is always paid in full by those on the lower levels and has no need to use his flute. (calliope may be a better choice here)  The movie didn't go far enough though because there is the ""next act"" -  the men of hindsight who come in to ""fix"" things are the same men of vision that were always there - and a new decade begins anew with a fresh set of suckers.

Kevin Spacey does his usual good job as Sam, the ""yes man"" department head who is relied upon by Jeremy Irons to keep things lined out - Irons gives the performance that really comes across as the most believable character portrayal of the film - that of the ruthless, untouchable head of a Wall Street trading and financial clearing firm.  He epitomizes the nature of the beast.  Sam buries his beloved dog the same night he has lost everything else, but it wasn't only the dog that died penniless.

  'Margin Call' is first time writer/director J.C. Chandor's distillation of the 2008 financial meltdown. Chandor creates a compilation firm based on Lehman Brothers and other Wall Street firms that tanked during the Wall Street economic crisis. The action is compressed down to one evening and a following morning despite the fact that the actual meltdown took place over a few months. The characters are entirely fictional and I heard that Chandor, during a talk at the new Lincoln Center film center, created the characters without consulting anyone specifically on Wall Street but then had some friends who were in the financial industry, look the script over once it had been completed.

  The plot is rather simple. Things come to head at Chandor's fictional firm, when seasoned risk management executive Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) is fired after another company downsizing. As he's being escorted from the building, he hands his subordinate, former physics ace, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), a flash drive containing a snapshot of the seemingly deteriorating financial situation at the firm (one wonders why 'security' allowed him to hand the flash drive over to Sullivan). A series of executives then are informed of the crisis, culminating in the arrival of the big boss, John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) who decides to sell off most of the company's assets resulting in big profits for the few executives and employees left at the firm but curtains for the rest of the underlings as well as a nasty kick in the pants to the overall US economy.

  Frankly, Chandor's attempt to dramatize the economic crisis is admirable but the subject matter doesn't really lend itself to palpable drama. Part of the problem is that many people (including myself) don't really understand how the financial system works. Chandor goes to great lengths to provide a simplified explanation for the financial collapse, but to be honest I still don't understand what it's all about, despite all of Chandor's attempts at transparency.

  Without a tension-filled plot, Chandor must fall back on strong characterizations of the principal players. Jeremy Irons really saves the day as CEO Tuld. Irons is the only actor amongst the solid cast, to turn his amoral financial executive into a flesh and blood human being. He also happens to have the best lines of dialogue in the script. Irons serves up a superb speech at the film's climax, detailing his cynical philosophy that financial downturns always occur in history and are unavoidable.

  The rest of the cast do their best in roles that are sorely underdeveloped. Quinto neatly conveys the integrity of a former ""rocket scientist"" who admits taking a job on Wall Street, simply ""for the money"". But Kevin Spacey struggles in his role as Sam, the ethical company man who refuses to quit because he also ""needs the money"". Chandor awkwardly attempts to humanize Spacey's Sam in the final scene, where the executive attempts to bury his recently deceased dog, under his ex-wife's lawn. The problem is that we don't find out enough about Sam to care about him. The same goes Paul Bettany as Will, whose main claim to fame is that he hangs out at strip clubs. Simon Baker does his best as the cold as steel executive Jared but he too lacks a back story. Ditto for Demi Moore's Sarah Robertson, who's thrown under the bus by CEO Fuld right before the big sell-off. Stanley Tucci ends up with the sorry sad sack role as the canned supervisor, who also throws principles to the wind by returning to the company one last time, after being threatened with retaliation by the sinking firm.

  Mr. Chandor must be commended for not only bringing the story of the the great 2008 financial collapse to the small screen but ensuring there were no happy endings. As in real life, the traders and executives broke no rules in this unregulated industry and hence were only guilty of ethical lapses, which of course were not punishable in a criminal court of law.

  There are those who may be satisfied with Chandor's sketchy and generic take on the financial collapse that precipitated the current financial downturn, but there are many more books and documentaries that will provide a more thoughtful and detailed reckoning of what really went on Wall Street during those heady times. If however, you wish to start with the basics, 'Margin Call' should be your baby.",1322870400,24,4427,4.947368421052632

4681350,4,B005FITIGO,"Fear not--although ""Margin Call"" focuses on events that precipitated the current economic meltdown, this movie is NOT about economics or arcane government policies. A knowledge of mortgage-backed securities is not required in order for you to enjoy this movie, If, however, you enjoy compelling performances in a tightly-paced, intelligently written and emotionally powerful movie, you'll enjoy this film.  An especially intriguing aspect of this movie is that it remains keenly focused on the three classical Aristotelian unities of drama: unity of action (the story remains centered on the imminent demise of the American economy), unity of place (the vast majority of the action occurs within one firm's corporate office), and unity of time (all of the action takes place in one 24-hour period.). The film's crowning achievement is its ability to depict the human drama, anxiety, and uncertainty that led to and resulted from the economic mess we're all coping with today. ""Margin Call"" belongs to a very rare genre--the economic thriller--and it succeeds mainly due to its brilliant script (by writer/director J.C. Chandor) and the mesmerizing performances of Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, Jeremy Irons, and Penn Badgley. This is good stuff.",1322006400,,1274,5.5

4681352,5,B005FITIGO,"Margin Call is among the best films I have seen this year, and has a message that is as current as the front page.  It is a well-written, taut thriller that has excellent performances all around.  Kevin Spacey turns in an outstanding performance as Sam Rogers, a company man who gradually lets go of all his illusions of being decent for money.  Zachary Quinto is excellent as Peter Sullivan who picks up where Stanly Tucci's character (Eric Dale) left off when he was a victim of downsizing.  Sullivan is more of an idealist and plays off his money-obsessed friend Seth Bregman (played by Penn Badgley) nicely.  Bregman knows the big bucks that the higher ups in the company and making and constantly astonishes Sullivan with what he knows.

As news of the company's mortgage backed security problems grows, people higher up in the company make an appearance, some flying in by helicopter. Jeremy Irons is excellent as John Tuld, the companies CEO, as he admits that he needs the problem explained to him in plain English but controls the situation coolly. Paul Bettany is excellent as Will Emerson, a somewhat burned out salesman who doesn't seem to care about the money but rises to the occasion to unload worthless investments on the unwary.  Demi Moore has a good part as a Risk Management officer - the lone female officer - who is in trouble following the revelation about the company's position. Her character coolly accepts what is going on and as the only woman; she knows that she is not one of the ""players.""  Simon Baker's character (Jared Cohen) is definitely a player and he presents a ruthless exterior perfectly.

Sullivan and Dale show an interesting side of their characters as opposed to the others in that they came from other backgrounds into finance.  Sullivan is a rocket scientist and Dale has a long monologue about how he built a bridge and save the local residents thousands of hours by shortening their daily commute.

Margin call is a film that grabs your interest from the start and doesn't let go. It provides an interesting commentary on the financial meltdown.  Of all the excellent performances in this film, Kevin Spacey remains for me a standout as his character faces a moral decision to let the company he has worked for fail or unload worthless financial products. In the end, the choice his character makes is the one the one that Wall Street made and would make again; save yourself and let someone else clean up the mess.",1321920000,,2464,4.758215962441315

4681355,4,B005FITIGO,"Margin Call does a commendable job showing the humanity - often very flawed humanity, like the rest of us - behind the sub-prime mortgage meltdown. Some of the people are more sympathetic than others just as some are more responsible, and more deliberately responsible, for what happened in the real world while others were swept along trying to stay alive - or at least solvent. The movie also touches briefly on some of the major background issues; the financial attractiveness of these financial analyst jobs to people who would otherwise be contributing their genius to invention, creation, and betterment of technology instead of playing games with money, and the way government regulations contributed to creating the rules that encouraged these risky money games and then toppled the money towers created as a result to devastating effect. The movie builds palpable tension as the crisis comes to a head and we even end up caring about and sympathizing with some of the people who have otherwise been portrayed as monstrous, cackling villains.",1321833600,,1050,5.146198830409356
4681356,2,B005FITIGO,"The topic is, of course on everyone's lips and unfortunately, people have no real clue what they are protesting or have any kind of understanding what happens behind the doors of these uber financial firms. The movie won't really progress you any further in your  understanding unless you are an economist. It had the feel of a documentary yet with none of the education or enlightenment of one. That leaves the entire film to the albeit superior acting skills of some of the cast to create interest. It never really happened for me. It was choppy and rushed yet still slow moving and boring if that makes any sense. The drama you are supposed to feel as a viewer is watching the actors stare at a computer screen and some printed reports with all of them acting with disbelief that in one afternoon the firm, the economy and all the world gets f'd over (pardon my vernacular). That should have weight, but again, I just didn't feel it. Give it three stars for the acting and for the darkness of the film. Minus one star for the techno jargon and ""open"" ending of the movie. I guess in real life, this story is still unfolding.",1321833600,3,1127,4.4975609756097565
4681357,3,B005FITIGO,"I am a fan of the mostly dialogue and little action type movies. Not many get made these days so when one comes along I salivate like Pavlov's dog. Margin Call is a fictional drama based on some of the real life events we saw mature in the 2008 economic meltdown. We are still reeling from this mess in 2011 and we will all be paying for the incomprehensible foolishness and cronyism for many, many, many years to come. This movie makes characters like Wall Street's Gordon Gecko look like a street beggar by comparison. Building houses of cards is nothing to be proud of and while the characters all feign humility and acknowledgment of that fact, none of them do anything to change it. Why? Because none of them actually believes it. Wealth and power have total control of their every waking (and even sleeping) moment.  In the end, all characters must admit to their failure as self-righteous twits because all involved were so personally leveraged they had to make a deal with the Devil.  Watching them all squirm offers a touch of fun for the viewer.

This is a decent film, though far from perfect. I can understand why some people will say it is just too boring. Yes there were times that I found myself a bit bored by the relentless diatribes full of justification through Darwinian zero sum game philosophy and the bang-you-over-the-head post modernist human condition, detestation for their fellow man (suckers deserve to lose) stuff. There is little subtly and nuance to this film; no lines of gray, no ambiguities. The characters are all despicable scoundrels and thieves who become a bit cartoonish at some point. More editing would have been appropriate as the movie is clearly half an hour too long.

All that said, I did enjoy it. Some of the writing is sharp, well researched, and it wasn't dumbed down for the masses like one might expect. Most people will not really understand what is going on.  What created such fear in these desk jockeys working to solve their problem over a 24 hour period becomes obvious as it is revealed to the movie goer that NO ONE really knows what's going on. Part of the point of the film is that no person or no group actually understood what was going on or how these ridiculous financial models were developed -let alone capitalized. In the end we are left wondering why so many ""smart"" people can leave values, sense, and sensibilities behind and do such stupid things...oh ya that's right, it's that whole greed thing. Not so fast. There has to be more to it than just greed right? The acting is sharp and well done by all. As expected Irons, Tucci, and Spacey are standouts -more Tucci would have been great.

This movie is an attempt to shed some light on the absurdity that has become Wall Street --where unbridled greed has become so ubiquitous that Wall Street firms and banks are now nothing short of crime syndicates staffed by well dressed con men.  This ain't your daddy's Wall Street anymore.  Gone are the antiquated Graham and Dodd days of fair valuation analysis and steady dividend yield investments.  What we have now are supercomputers processing probability algorithms designed by rocket scientists processing at millions of iterations per second.  What they are doing isn't illegal (yet?), but it is wrong and they all know it. When heavy-handed government regulation comes crashing down on the financial industry they all cry foul but they have no one to blame but themselves.

BTW, how's your 401K doing these days???  Recommended.",1321833600,29,3505,4.765676567656766
4681358,3,B005FITIGO,"First of all, I will say that the cast of this film is a pretty impressive one. Kevin Spacey gets top billing, but most of the characters are portrayed by folks with lengthy lists of acting credits, oftentimes pretty high profile. I found it interesting that they would all be drawn to a film like this that isn't super high profile. Demi Moore plays the one female character of note.

So as not to spoil things for those who intend on watching the film, I'll just say the plot is basically one where a major financial firm finds itself in a bad spot in terms of mortgage security holdings and has to work its way out of it. Actually, the story is that simple and straightforward. No major plot twists. There also isn't too much in the way of high level quant stuff aside from a VAR reference, though there could easily have been (for better or worse, depending on your point of view). There did seem to be a reference to the so-called formula that killed Wall Street, but only in passing.

I was tempted to call this movie a morality tale, but that's not really a good description. The story's major tension is one of character perspective and turmoil between the idea of doing what needs to be done for the sake of the firm (at least as they see it) and the impact that could/would have in the broader scope. There is no real attempt to provide a ""right"" answer, though. It ends up being more a question of characters working through their own issues.

Overall, I found the film a bit plodding and lacking in the kind of tension and drama that pulls the viewer through to the conclusion of movies like Wall Street (the original, not the sequel) and Dealers. This one ends with a bit of a whimper.",1321833600,7,1698,4.401273885350318

4681369,4,B005FITIGO,"The forces that took the nation over the financial edge and into the great recession are no more complicated than human greed.  They operated on every level from people buying more house than they could afford (the main culprit), to politicians and banks facilitating and encouraging riskier and riskier financial endeavors.

To keep the farce alive and running, Wall Street took the reins and ran with the money.  Everyone seemed happy as long as the money kept rolling in.  Though the financial underpinnings were never sound, things just kept rolling along.  Why rock the boat?

This required a lot of looking the other way by political leaders and denial on the part o the general public.  No one should be surprised that the house of cards came tumbling down.

This movie is about the beginnings of the crash (fictionalized) and how a financial tsunami begins.  This drama delivers some fine performances from Zachary Quinto, Demi Moore, Keven Spacey, Paul Bettany, and Jeremy Irons.  It gives faces and form to what could prove to be a financial Apocalypse that could leave the nation in ruins, only time will tell on that front.

From a business standpoint we see the forces that drive the decisions to cut one's losses and take it on the chin, survival for survival's sake.

We also see moral and ethical struggles which ultimately succumb to going along with the crowd, despite the consequences.

The movie is a look at a small piece of a big puzzle, and the issues that it required the players to face, and their ultimate failure at dealing with them.

What works for me about this movie is that it's a beginning of putting the great recession into context, and getting us to take a look in the mirror to see our part in all of this.

The question is:  can we be honest with ourselves?",1320537600,,1795,4.686900958466453
4681370,5,B005FITIGO,"Up-front warning: there are no exploding cars, steamy sex scenes or ""You can't handle the truth!"" catch-phrases in this remarkable movie. Don't get me wrong, I like that type of movie, but this is something different. It's a drama, not a melodrama. It's a reality show about actual reality, which unlike most reality shows, usually moves along in an orderly fashion.

If you've never been a manager in a serious company, it might not appeal to you. As an ex-software company exec, I can say it felt real to me. I found the story exciting, because I could relate to the characters and their understated pain. Many things are shown, rather than stated. For example, they work all night long in their suits, but no one ever talks about going home, or the hours, etc. If you've been in a management crisis and experienced a long hellish night, you'll feel this movie in your bones.

The best part was the placement of the viewer in the shoes of the company execs. Imagine your place of work for 20 or 30 years going down in flames around you. If you are a teacher, imagine the school is going to close at the end of the week forever if you make the wrong choice tonight. Every kid in your school will never be educated if you fail. The only way to possibly save yourself and your students is to lie your ass off. That is not a fun place to be, and that's the tension behind the film.

On a final note, I didn't sense an overt political viewpoint from the filmmakers. I didn't feel this was a hit-piece on Wall Street or anyone else. It was dramatized and probably shrunken down in time-scale, but quite believable. I found that refreshing.",1320451200,168,1635,4.461538461538462

The characters in this movie are so generic they could have walked out of an old Hollywood war horse like Executive Suite.

I started working in the 1990s on wall street at a time when Risk Management meant something and at a time when firms like JP Morgan out of 23 wall was leading risk management with risk metrics and most of us coming out of great Universities with technical degrees were welcomed, albeit heralded as the saviors of the new age of finance. Sadly we believed it and so did the rest of the world including key people in the administration ""Summers"" defended our new financial engineering products so much so that even in light of the near collapse of LTCM they said that we had it right. Why do we believe that we can dilute ourselves? Mass delusion I say. And I say it again we must be mass deluded. As an insider working in Private Equity who never lost his job after the financial crisis I have to say three things. One that the movie I just saw is very accurate narrating what did happen,as to which firm it was portrayed in the film? well that I won't say, not because I cant say but because it isn't for me to say but what I can say is that it isn't the obvious one it is not Lehman.  Second is that the movie reflects on something that it is amiss among our society which is the lack of what we call Humanity and common sense. Third is that I totally understand why people feel the way they do about us wall streeters, we have not lived up to the expectations  or rather, we have. Lastly I can say that we all have to live up to a higher standard one where we think of the better choices that we have to make and i hope that this film gets people to thing about what those choices are. No one wants to go home after a long career or a short one feeling that they have just sold their soul or realize that they did a long time ago. Finance and Econ are important parts or our society The management of limited resources is a key function for our leaders to help us perform and us too. When doing so, we should not over rely on esoteric financially engineered products we should challenge those who structure them to create products that truly benefit us in the long term, and in order to do so we need to think Long term, just as men like Steve Jobs did when he thought about innovation beyond him, hence the title of this review, Long Term Capital Management LLC.

4681376,5,B005FITIGO,"I saw a Kevin Spacey interview where he claims the practices in ""Margin Call"" are still going on today. This review contains some early plot synopsis for those who may have some trouble with the Wall Street jargon. The film appears to be about a fictional investment firm at the start of the 2008 financial crisis.

The drama opens with an investment bank downsizing. An outside agency has been hired to do the layoffs. We see sad scenes of people being tapped and escorted out. This company laid off much of its middle level management layers and kept the worker bees. Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), a big boss is visibly upset. He has a bottle of Pepto-Bismo on his desk. His Chocolate Lab is dying. Spacey is spending $1,000 a day to keep his dog alive. While he appears to be reviving his role in ""Horrible Bosses""  we later find out he is our closest thing to a good guy.

One of the laid off mid-level bosses, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) hands off a thumb drive to Seth Bregman (Zachary Quinto) who burns the midnight oil going over the data. Bregman panics at the numbers. The volatility index (VI) indicates the company will incur losses that will greatly exceed its total assets. The firm goes into panic mode. The company holds bad assets known as derivatives which is nothing more than pieces of various risk mortgages lumped together. If they attempt to dump them all, without buying, people will suspect something is up and won't buy their assets. If they wait too long to dump them, the fear is someone else will figure out what is going on and beat them to the punch. They are between the proverbial ""rock and a hard place.""

This sets the wheels in motion as the CEO is notified that the company may collaspe.

Penn Badgley views their job as legalized gambling. They make $250,000 a year crunching numbers and think their bosses who make $2.5 million a year are obscenely overpaid. Jeremy Irons plays the stereotypical CEO who doesn't seem knowledgeable about their product.

Now in spite of the fact this is dealing with issues beyond most people's lives, everyone one of us knows the results of an economy crash. The actors did a superb job holding our interest in the film as each person handles the stress differently.

What will the investment firm do to survive? As things get ugly, the drama becomes more interesting.

F-bomb, no sex or nudity. Rare film that has strippers and Demi Moore in which she is not one of them.",1319932800,41,2439,4.6036866359447
4681377,5,B005FITIGO,"This is the type of movie I've grown to love more as I get older (I'm in my mid 30s). I'd rather have a scene with something fascinating unfolding in a company's boardroom followed by a private backroom conversation between characters as imposing as the ones Spacey and Irons can conjure, I'd rather have that than my screen being filled with explosions, CGI effects and cheesy one liners. This is the best film I've seen this year. Period. In this film you get to be a fly on the wall as one of the most age defining events of the decade (the financial meltdown) occur. I didn't take my eye off the screen for the whole duration of the film. I just couldn't. I watched captain America the other day and I simply didn't care about the characters or about anything that was happening on screen. I took phone calls, went to the kitchen for coffee, etc. (And it's not like I can't appreciate a good superhero movie, Thor was awesome, but Hollywood nowadays, is turning into a one liner fest with no substance). The only thing that this movie allowed me to do while it was playing, was to look at the screen and breathe in order to keep a steady body temperature. I didn't do anything else. It was THAT good. I know it's  a totally different type of film (compared to Captain America) but a good  movie is a good movie. Period.  I wish more movies like these were made.",1319932800,,1365,4.387351778656127
4681378,1,B005FITIGO,"Two hours of excruciatingly boring dialogue and general lack of interesting storytelling. No twists, no satisfying accomplishments or any reason to like the characters at all. We kept hoping one of the characters would be shot and/or shoot himself, but sadly this did not happen. Sam's dying dog is intended to be a metaphor for the financial industry or the stock market, but it better applies to the movie itself - a long, drawn out process with no human element.",1319846400,12,465,4.825
4681379,1,B005FITIGO,"Don't waste your time or money. Very slow, predictable and boring.  It is rated R because every fourth line uses the ""f"" word.  Otherwise it would be rated G.  There is no sex, violence or action.  A yarn aimed at beating up on Wall Street with a few big name actors. The one star was for the acting.",1319846400,11,300,4.120689655172414

8470069,5,B005FITIGO,"Subdued, highly intelligent dialogue driven film that gets to the heart of the modern Western capitalist system. I've watched this film more than once and get something new from it each time, every scene is well constructed and conveys subtle/hidden meanings and concepts. This is the only film I have ever seen that gives a true insight into the way modern capitalism works and the moral/philosophical questions and consequences behind it, in a balanced, nuanced and very HUMAN way. Make no mistake its not a film about numbers or the technical mechanics of our system, its a film about human beings and the world we've created around the concept of the free market system. I highly recommend it and cannot praise it enough.",1526774400,,725,4.902439024390244
