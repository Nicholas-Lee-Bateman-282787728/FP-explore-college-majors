I hit a goldmine in this video which gave me historical facts, scenic views and a description of the wide variety of people who make their home in Guyana. I relied heavily on this video and would recommend it for anyone who plans to visit that beautiful country!",1209859200,,439,4.432098765432099

8031595,5,B0002T8FTC,"Guyana Ecotourism! I have watched entralled at this 60 minutes VHS  and it is unbelievable how exciting it is. Guyana Eco tours or rather ecotourism in Guyana makes island sand and beach pale in comparison. Ecotourism in Guyana is very exciting. As a result of this VHS I took three of my friends to Guyana. One Australian, one German and the other, a Scandinavian female. My friends were so excited, they gushed praises upon the breathtaking beauty of Guyana. I must say this VHS, which we took along as a reminder of the places on it that we wanted to experience, was very acurate describing these places as 'Spectacular Wonders of Nature', as indeed they were! This is truly a remarkable production. I rate this VHS five stars! (I wish they had ten stars to rate this VHS. I would use it all up) A Tropical Adventure, Guyana Ecotours, a must-have on either DVD or VHS!----This review is excerpted from Caribbean Diary Magazine and written by Nadia De Frietas, it's Assistant Editor",1116115200,2,984,4.72093023255814
