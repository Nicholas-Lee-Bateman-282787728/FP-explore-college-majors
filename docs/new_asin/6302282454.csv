The framing device is a farse where in B&W, an entriprenure attempts to gather an orchestra of old ladies, a burly conductor and an imprisoned illustrator to ""out Disney Disney"".  The humor in these interludes are slapstick and humorous at best.  Of course, it all goes wrong, and that's part of this film's charm.
There are two versions of this film.  The original, presented here on VHS, and another version of solely the animated classical pieces...be sure which version you are buying.

457054,4,6302282454,"Released about half way between Disney's Fantasia and its sequel, Fantasia 2000, Bozzetto's film consists of short animated pieces set to classical music, interspersed with live-action sequences. The latter lean towards lowbrow physical comedy, and I don't find them particularly helpful, although the opening sequence is quite funny: ""The Director"" explains to us that this film is an experiment in cinematic expression - ""You might call it a 'fantasia'"" - and immediately gets a call from the Legal Department. I thought that was a clever way of acknowledging Disney, without being cowed by him.

  The animated pieces are less uniform than the original Fantasia, in style and in quality, and are also more political; human ""civilization"", and our distancing from the natural world, are frequent targets. The Firebird sequence (Stravinsky) is funny, but also a bit of a polemic, and Disney's own Firebird sequence in Fantasia 2000 - clearly influenced by Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke - is much more magical. But the Vivaldi segment could have been made by Disney himself, as a bee trying to set up a picnic for her family is repeatedly interrupted by an amorous human couple completely unaware of how disruptive they are. Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun (Debussy) captures both an innocent eroticism and the sadness of old age; Valse Triste (Sibelius) is poignant and touching, as a cat wanders through the desolate remains of a house that was once alive with warmth and family. The masterpiece, however, is Ravel's Bolero, as the inexorable dance rhythms of the music are transformed into the inexorable march of life on Earth, with humanity breaking the rhythm and finally shattering the whole process.

  The DVD is a great improvement on the original VHS release, in which the Firebird was plagued by awful wavering in pitch, as if the film had come loose during the transfer. Sound and picture are very good this time, and there are several short films by Bozzetto as a bonus, though these are more basic in execution.

  If you like the concept of Fantasia, you will like this movie; if you have seen Disney's Fantasia (or Fantasia 2000), you should at least rent this; and if you own one or both Disney films, you should buy this one too. The Disney Fantasias are just out in a DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack, and the video restoration is stunning; Bozzetto's film recently went out of print, but thanks to Amazon, it is easy to find new (and used) copies for sale.",1293148800,2,2469,4.915865384615385

It was Allegro Non Troppo--and what impressed me the most was how it made mincemeat out of Disney's  Fantasia (which I saw for the first time when I was 4, and to this day remains my all time Disney favorite).

Another reviewer described them as mean, that is the perfect way to describe them. The ""story"" of these pieces is that the director and conducter have tormented and forced a group of elderly women to play the pieces (at one point beating an old woman - off screen) and tortured (ie chained up in a cellar and starved) the animator. Perhaps there was something funny about torture when this film came out that I am missing now. I did really love the animations and music though.

457059,4,6302282454,"I loved this movie when I saw it at the theater in the 1970's. Years later I purchased it on Laser disc when it became available. That version was the American theatrical edition, which had about 10 minutes cut out of the live action sequences with some mixing around of the footage so that it would make some sense to the American audiences that viewed it. The live action parts always seemed a bit choppy to me and it wasn't until I purchased the current dvd version that I realized the original Italian version had 10 more minutes of live action footage. Now don't get me wrong the live action portions of A.N.T. are fairly clunky, crude slapstick and don't really mesh well with the great music and animation portions of this film, but still, it was the film makers original intent.
In the animation portions in the new dvd the colors are much more vivid and rich as compared to the Laser disc version, which look washed out as though they had tried to brighten the image when they transferred it to Laser. My only complaints might be that the image on the dvd version has the opposite problem, at times it appears so dark that it's hard to make out what's on screen, but overall the pluses out weigh the minuses on the animation of the dvd. What might have really made this dvd great is if they had let you have the choice between the full length version and a version with only the music and animation on a dual layer dvd. For those two reasons I gave it four stars instead of five.",1245974400,2,1488,4.375451263537906

457061,5,6302282454,"As many reviews have mentioned, the Cat and the Evolution pieces are outstanding achievements, as are many others of the creative animations.

One thing not yet noted, which helps one to more easily swallow the live-action segments, is that ""Allegro non Troppo"" can be translated as ""Not too Swift,"" an English slang for someone not too bright or intelligent, literally embodied by the would-be director of the octagenarian musical ensemble and timid animator.

This is certainly a classic of animation, done without the benefit of computer special-effects, but with a realism & sense of humor rarely seen in such ventures.",1232323200,,623,5.22
457062,5,6302282454,"Allegro non Troppo is, like most works of genius, flawed in some fundamental ways, but I cannot picture it in any other way. Its flaws -- like your crazy uncle's greased up hair -- make its genius stand out over a backdrop of humanity we know all too well. I refer to the slapstick live-action humor between animated sequences. It's funny; don't let the nay-sayers turn you away before you see it. But it's also painful. The writers obviously had not purged the fascist terrors of the 1930s and 1940s from their proud Italian souls, and still had that story to tell. In the end (the sequences all add up to their own ""movie"") good triumphs, and even a love interest is made viable in a Chaplinesque way. The live-action sequences are definitely worth watching all the way through, at least once. Then you may skip through it if you like!

But let's talk about the animation, for that's what the film is really about. And the music. The musical choices are terrific, though you have to ask if you want to associate images with your favorite classical works for the rest of your life. I find it not too hard to substitute images of my own, so it's not a bother to me, but some have trouble. If that's the case, then you might avoid Fantasia, as well. Many others in this review section have listed the pieces and animation segments, so I won't go through them again, one-by-one. Instead, let's look at the animation as a whole. It's cartoon animation, as opposed to Disney's more detailed and thorough artistry with the jaw-dropping effects that Disney created and others imitated poorly. So, from the outset you see the style of animation and realize that this is not an imitation of DIsney, but an artistic statement of its own. Therein lies part of its genius. We're not surprised when we see naked breasts or actual live footage briefly flash through some animations, for this is clearly the artistic creation of one person -- a person who has much to say and wastes no time getting it said. Why should art merely entertain on the surface, with wistful nostalgia and cutesy expressions? Bozzetto gets down to the big themes. Prelude: Afternoon of a Faun, for example, deals with the ubiquitous tragedy of aging, of losing one's powers, a condition of humanity (and all creatures, for that matter) from which there is no return. One can feel the palpable frustration of the character who sees everywhere the objects of his desire, but is only rejected by them. In the end, he becomes almost infantile against the bosom of the world -- from dust to dust -- from which he came.

Then there's the sequence about egos: the desire to set one's self apart, followed by the annoyance of copycats. And once he's established his reputation as the one to follow, the deviously vengeful maverick prepares a horrible trick to play upon his adversarial plagiarists... only to find that there ARE some things they won't do. He has underestimated their intelligence after all! Dvorak's Slavic Dance No. 7 seems to have been presciently composed with this sequence in mind!

Evolution was tackled by Disney in Fantasia, and was a monumental achievement in animation artistry. Disney used Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, for which the composer actually collaborated with Disney making cuts and changes he later claimed to regret. Bozzetto realized he could do better. Evolution isn't so dramatic; it's the continual march of living things through the terror of annihilation toward survival. What better work than Bolero, which repeats the same two themes verbatim until the climactic modulation to E Major, each repetition altered only in the orchestration. Similarly, the evolving protoplasms each ""improve"" over their last forms, only to be trumped by the next round. One tricky creature sets himself apart from the whole march partway through; the ape. With bad-boy antics, he leaps over the rest until they arrive at the future, only to find that he's beat them to it and laid out new rules. It's hilarious and deep. Would that all philosophy could be so ingeniously published.

Bozzetto's ""Firebird"" subjects our satanic tormentor with his own medicine, possibly curing him of his evil ways, but there seems to be little connection between the music and the animation, other than on the most banal level. Disney really does trump Bozzetto in Fantasia 2000, where the Firebird is treated to an animation much closer to the real story, and one which also is a tear-jerker that leaves you with hope. Unfortunately, Allegro non Troppo is a bit too senza-allegro for me at this point, though again I can't deny its creativity and uniqueness.

Others have focused on the dreamy-eyed cat, which was always a favorite in our household, too, so I won't go into it, other than to say that it so affected my children at a young age that I think they ""got it"" for life. They are adults now, but they both have powerful political opinions traceable to that sequence. Yes, it's that moving. Would that the world could see.

The animation style gets thin sometimes, but the sequences are imbued with imagination that keeps your focus from becoming critical of the visual plainness. Truly, they are works of genius -- and we are reminded in the live-action slapstick that genius isn't always what it seems. There's a lot of plain work involved. So, we are led to appreciate the beauty even more: that it exists at all, rather than having gotten shoved back onto the shelf before a budget and staff were committed to creating it. Not everyone could have made this happen. Of course, had his budget been Disney-esque, the animation might have been far more artistic, but I'll take what we've got and be thankful that the world tossed up this weird, wonderful, and tremendously moving commentary on the most human of themes.

As I said in the beginning, this is a flawed work, but one of great genius. Nobody will like every bit of it, but there is something important for everyone in this film. It should be in every video library. Seriously. On the level of Koyaanisqatsi, Baraka, Fantasia and its successor, Fantasia 2000, this is an outstanding work that is as much social commentary as work of art, and the artists who created it clearly had some firsthand experience with the evils this world has produced... as well as its most endearing beauties. Treat yourself. Treat everyone you know.

There's not a clunker in the lot, and indeed a true lover of animation will only be left hungry for more of Bozzetto's work.

It's a play within a play--both the making of the film featuring a sadistic conductor, meglomaniacal director, and put upon artist and the film itself. The interspersion of making which was Italian slapstick in black and white with ""Fantasia""-like animation set to the classics was brilliant. All five of us watching were laughing, crying, shouting out comments, throughout the whole film.

Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun--Debussy shows us an aging satyr whose appearance reminded us of Sigmund Freud. He dreams of capturing a faun are almost over.  He tries all the usual tricks: combover, facelift, etc. WIth a little help from avian friends, he's transformed into a redhaired Reynard the Fox looking character.

Bolero--Ravel begins with astronauts dropping an old fashioned Coke bottle onto an alien planet and seeing life evolve from the last bit of ooze from the soft drink.

Valse Triste--Jean Sibelius opens with a tabby cat crawling from beneath the wreckage of a home and recalling brighter days. Out of all the animated characters in this film, this vignette brought startled tears to my eyes.

457089,5,6302282454,"If you are one of those people who buys into the mostly-USAian delusion that all animation should be fluffy bunnies and Care Bears and suitable for even the youngest children, this is not a DVD for you.

If you're interested in this movie due to fondly remembering it from its 1977 US theatrical release, be warned that - as ""Leon"" is a different film from its original edited/softened US release as ""The Professional"" - this is a different, more European film.

Ten minutes have been restored, and they're mostly or all in the live-action framing sequences - bits that were cut for the original US release because they were too earthy or potentially ""offensive"" for any of a number of reasons.  The animated sequences, are just as brilliant as you probably remember. The film is presented here in its original Italian, with subtitles available.

The image is clean and the sound clear.

Responding to a few things in earlier reviews:

First: The ""director"" in the framing sequence doesn't say they're going to *call* the film ""Fantasia"" - he says it will *be* ""a fantasia"", which, according to the dictionary is:

1. Music.
  a. a composition in fanciful or irregular form or style.
b. a potpourri of well-known airs arranged with interludes and florid embellishments.

2. {Literature} an imaginative or fanciful work, esp. one dealing with supernatural or unnatural events or characters: ""The stories of Poe are fantasias of horror.""

3. something considered to be unreal, weird, exotic, or grotesque.

Every part of that definition pretty well covers some part of trhis film...

Second: ""Allegro non Troppo"" (short for ""Allegro ma non troppo allegro"") is a musical direction that literally translates as ""fast/sprightly but not *too* fast"".

I'd say that this film - mostly for the ""Afternoon of a faun"" sequence and some of the framing sequence - is about PG-13 level.  You might want to pre-screen it before letting pre-teens watch it.  (Personally, i wouldn't have any problem with that, but your mileage may vary.)

I will say that anyone who can remain dry-eyed after the ""Sad Waltz"" (Sibelius' ""Valse Triste"") sequence had probably better go back to ""Shrek"" or ""Die Hard IV"" or similar films. (From the opening and the last shot in this sequence, it appears to me, BTW, as if the old house in that sequence is being knocked down in order to build more soulless concrete boxes, rather than being a bombed-out relic of war...)

The extra material on the DVD includes ten of Bozzetto's short films (and, if you consider [live action] full-frontal female nudity offensive, you might want to skip some of them), and an Italian TV dcumentary, ""The Worlds of Bruno Bozetto"".

Bozzetto describes one of his long-time collaborators as an ""Italian Tex Avery"", and the description is apt - both in the anarchic spirit of the work, and in the way that it is willing to go further than much USAian animation.

A brilliant film for animation/music fans who aren't irevocably hung up on the idea that all animation should be clean, pretty and inoffensive.",1193270400,22,3049,4.906432748538012

It has all of the brilliant animation set to beautiful classical music that Disney's Fantasia has, but it also has much more emotional depth.  While Fantasia is great (and I love it, too), Allegro non Troppo really puts you through an emotional roller coaster ride with moments ranging from very funny to very sad and everything in between.  It's a great addition to anyone's dvd collection because it's not only very entertaining, but it's also sure to be different than anything else you already have.

The themes are more adult than Disney but certainly not any worse than fairy tales we tell our children before going to bed.

The animation of the abandoned cat for Valse Triste will bring a tear to anyone's eye. Bolero, while known for it's erotic theme in other movies and personal situations, will never be the same!

457131,5,6302282454,"Allegro Non Troppo is an open tribute to Disney's Fantasia. Instead of being a slavish derivative, however, it stands very well on its own.

The format is the same, a set of animations set to classical music, separated by brief live-action interludes. The interludes are set in an orchestra - but with a hilarious difference. The conductor could be the prototype for ""the pointy-haired boss,"" always abusing the poor animator, while the impresario tries desperately to hold the show together.

The cartoons are the real point of the movie. They leave out most of Fantasia's cuteness and add in a big dose of satire. The opening piece, set to Bolero, chronicles life on earth. It starts with the earliest primordial blob, and works up to - well, see for yourself. A piece by Vivaldi accompanies a poor bee trying to get a square meal, while the giant humans trample everything in sight. Other pieces comment on blind urbanization, or (my favorite) show what might have happened if Eve had left the apple with the snake.

This isn't one for the kiddies, unless you're very broad-minded. It is a keeper, though, and I look forward to seeing it again.

this is not animation for children, but rather what Fantasia's creators could've done if left to their own choice of musical pieces and evoking any subject that came to mind, not censured for young audiences.

457168,4,6302282454,"I have the laserdisc of Allegro Non Troppo, and it's good to see that it's finally going to be released on DVD.  As most readers of this already know, ANT is Bruno Bozzetto's Fantasia-styled movie.  ANT has a beautiful sense of humor that no Disney animated movie has had.  Some of the animation in some of the scenes is ""primitive"" compared to Fantasia, but the simple animation works very well with the humorous scenes.  My favorite animated scenes?  Slavonic Dance and the Finale.  Very funny stuff (and very simply drawn, too.)  This is a great movie and I hope it gets proper treatment for DVD.  One thing that appears to be missing from the DVD is the English-dubbed track for the live-action scenes between the animated scenes.  It will be nice to hear the original Italian dialog, but I will not be able to understand it and have to rely on the subtitles.  It's sad that the English dubbing has not been included. (Why hasn't it been included?)  Especially in comedies like ANT, dubbing into other languages can be used for comedic effect. (An extreme example of this is What's Up, Tiger Lily?)  For this reason, I'm giving 4 stars for the DVD.  Despite the lack of the English track, I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD's release...but I will still hang on to my laserdisc.",1073520000,3,1275,4.638392857142857

457170,4,6302282454,"Allegro Non Troppo.  The title is Italian for a musical instruction in classical music.  Literally translated, it means ""cheerful, not too much""
The b&w live action segments, which take place in the beginning and inbetween animation, feature a young presenter, who tells us proudly, ""This show is destined for immortality.  Music interpreted in cartoons."" He then says the movie is called Fantasia, only to get a phone call, at which he's clearly embarrassed.  ""They've say some guy already made this picture, a certain Crisney, Prisney, an American.""  Which he doesn't believe.  The rough and brutal conductor has more the manner of the local butcher, and the orchestra, consisting of old women in their 60's through 80's, are fearful of him, as is the animator, a mild-mannered man with a balding but flowing haircut that makes him look more like an 18th century composer.  His creations make the old ladies applaud, laugh, and cry.  There's a funny segment involving a gorilla (don't ask) and him doing the Russian kalinka dance.
The first is Claude Debussy's Prelude a l'Apres-midi d'un faune, which traces the repeated attempts of an aging, pudgy satyr to have one of the beautiful, nude and nubile women for himself.  Debussy did write this dreamy work harkening back to the idyllic paganism of Greece.  I was surprised my parents let me see this when I was nine(!)
Antonin Dvorak's Slavic Dance No. 7 tells the story of a man who moves from his cave-dwelling neighbours to live alone, only to have his actions imitated by the neighbours.  Frustrated, he constructs a different house, only to be imitated by the mindless crowd.  Their imitative actions give him an idea.
The next two segments are stand head and shoulders above the others.  Life evolved from a Coke bottle, one of the glass ones, not the plastic ones we have today.  That is set to Ravel's Bolero.  To which the presenter asks, ""Who composed it?""  From some bubbling liquid Coke, to an amoeboid creature to a reptile, and beyond, the animation also presents the march of life over the ages.  The tempo of animation accelerates in tune with the music, where each instrument takes its turn playing the repeated 8-measure tune based on a Spanish dance.  Dinosaurs, prehistoric birds, sea creatures, and even the ape, all walk across the volcanic landscape, and things really heat up when the strings kick in for the first time.
The animation to Jean Sibelius's Valse Triste put a real tear in my eye, as it portrays a cat who climbs from a crawlspace under a large house, only to discover it is a bombed ruin.  The cat's eyes glow when it remembers happier times, such as an old lady knitting in a sofa, a caged canary, when the house was full of life in general.  The colourful scenes when the house is reconstructed in its glory days is a highlight.  However, the cat is clearly distressed upon seeing the stark wreckage.
A perky and funny bee's nice lunch in the meadow is constantly disrupted by an amorous human couple.  The music is set to one of Antonio Vivaldi's concerti, which resembles the Spring segment of the Four Seasons.
Set to Igor Stravinsky's ""Fire Bird"" is a revisionist retelling of the Creation, Adam and Eve, and the Serpent.  Both Adam and Eve refuse the Apple, to which the Serpent himself eats it, and gets a nightmare flurry of images, a post-industrial hell, complete with horned demons and live footage of the night life.  The image of the heart filled with money is a telling one.
The attempt of an Igor-like behemoth to find a fitting finale from the files is actually pretty funny and warped.
Bruno Bozetto's animation is in varied styles, be it the lovely hues of idyllic Greece or the collage of twisted images in the finale.  The overall theme here is how the post-industrial society comes into conflict with the old ways, be it pre-war days, romance, and nature.  I first saw part of this back in 1977, and 26 years later, have finally seen this parody of Fantasia in its entirety, and am glad because of it.

457171,5,6302282454,"Many many years ago, I saw this film and I was absolutely transfixed.  This film cannot helped be compared to Fantasia because they mention this themselves.  But what sets this film apart is it's absolutely brilliant interpetations, in animated form, of these wonderful classical pieces that don't get as much attention as the ones Fantasia made popular amongst the general public.  And there is one classical piece, above all, that was so brilliantly interpeted that it STILL stands out as one of the most moving pieces ever to be put on screen and that is the ""Valse Triste"" segment set to the music of Sibelius.  Don't get me wrong, Disney's ""clean"" animation of Fantasia is a wonderful film, but none of it's segment moved me as much as Valse Triste.  And I think it's free form, scruby, it's understated color use and none heavy handed animation fits BRILLIANTLY here.  You don't feel you are watching an animation, you feel as you are watching a painter, with each stroke, visualize the musical note of this wonderful classical piece.  You get to see the abandon cat go from fantasy, reality, fantasy, that you wish you could adopt the poor cartoon kitty.  If you are a teacher of music, especially classical, get this film and show it to your students, if they are not moved, then nothing will moved them.

I spent most of my viewing time waiting for something unique or interesting to occur. In some ways it's experimental, but could be better described as something sketchy, derivative, and half-realized. Some animation sequences look like discards from Yellow Submarine or The Point, while a very stylized devil-like creature in another sequence was directly stolen from Gahan Wilson. The dissimilar, conflicted drawing styles present in most segments are what gives the film an awkward appearance. Another part which spoils the film is that much of the run time is dominated by various bland, gooey creatures morphing and morphing to what seems like a lifetime to nowhere. Also, Bozzetto's sequences satirizing man's greediness and obsession with world domination come on so thick and heavy it's as if he has to share this recent revelation with the world by hitting everyone over the head with a mallet. The most visually striking sequence is the one with the phantom cat who reminisces and longs for the life and people he once knew, however, the sentimental aspect is so overblown that it results in something tiresome and pathetically disagreeable for the viewer.

My general impression is that Bozzetto was at a loss when it came time to finish most of his animated segments. My problem isn't that the segments lacked tidy endings, but end in abrupt blackouts. Contrary to what many have said, Allegro Non Troppo does not match or surpass Disney's Fantasia by any means. It merely borrows a few themes, shares a similar segmented format, and sets those segments to well-known classical music works as Fantasia did. Aside copying from Disney and others, the animation of Allegro Non Troppo fails to match up with its powerful classical music score.
