7810693,5,6301216172,"The other reviews you will read for this film are all insightful and to the point. I like to view it from a historical perspective. Today there are both kids and adults who never heard of Sam Baugh, or Gene Autry for that matter. For those who are aware of the serial years  1929 to 1956) we know them to be an intregal part of movie making. There is very little on either the big screen or your TV that was not in the serials. And they were amazingly prophetic of the future. Flying wings, television, personal radio communications, radio guided weapons all as early as 1936. King of the Texas Rangers had speed boats and air craft of various kinds, but its excitement was in its variety of action and ever changing locale. As with King of the Royal Mounted, Republic actually went on location away from the boring and familiar rock piles of north Los Angeles County. Sammy Baugh was a pleasant surprise and could have had a career as a Republic western star. Many people my age have commented on the great sound track music of Republic 's thrillers. Cy Feur turned out a masterpiece for this one. KING is a prewar/ spy enemy agent obviously Nazis set in the Texas oil fields with non stop action. My DVD is top quality sight and sound. Its King of the Royal Mounted with southwest scenery and Sammy is a charmer you and your kids will love",1319673600,3,1341,4.407258064516129

7810695,5,6301216172,I was in fifth or sixth grade when I saw the first chapter of this serial. (I am 71 years old now.) I really loved westerns and it was a few years before I became a Redskin fan. I really liked Sammy Baugh and looking at the special effects in the serial now really makes me appreciate the genius of the people who made them.,1046476800,5,324,4.0
