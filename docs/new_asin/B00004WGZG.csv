7925303,4,B00004WGZG,"I bought this concert on VHS when it first came out. The addition of Rick Medlocke & HT on guitars was a great addition. Rick Medlocke first played drums with LS in the early days, while HT honed his skills with the Outlaws. This lineup solidified the ""New Lynyrd Skynyrd"" as a way to continue to be the greatest Southern Rock band of all times. This is a concert that needs to be seen by all LS fans. This concert follows their album ""Twenty"", which is honestly one of their best albums of all time. It's finally out on DVD and is a must see, you won't regret it.",1186444800,4,564,4.18348623853211
