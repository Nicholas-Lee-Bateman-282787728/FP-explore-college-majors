8209865,4,B000TK3648,"Wow, this show needs to come out in Region 1 ASAP. It's vicious and hilarious; sweet and scary. It presents an eerie picture of modern urban London and its ""chav"" culture. The Punks of the 70s and 80s are dead or retired. The chavs have taken over and they are freakin' scary. Imagine a school full of ""Vickie Pollards"" (Little Britain). Completely politically incorrect with a ""pan-Eastern"" headmaster who uses the girls bathroom -- whether they are in there or not, and uses the school to raise dangerous animals which they auction off to make money for the school. Insane! Bring it!",1211068800,,585,4.745098039215686
