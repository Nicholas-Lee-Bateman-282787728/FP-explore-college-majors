7756204,4,B01G6AS4FU,"+++Warning, minor spoilers ahead, but no major giveaways+++

This is a show with a similar premise to the 2008 movie of the same name.  I did like that the main character in the show has a bit more depth than the character in the movie did.  It does take a ""yeah right"" attitude to expect that a 2nd year law student who gets a clerkship at a large patent litigation firm would have the time to ever start getting into the high priced escort business.  That aside, it did make for a compelling story knowing that everything was eventually going to fall apart for her.  Although I did think that gave a bit of that away too early.  I think holding off the how long can she keep it a secret and not affect her ""real"" life could have been stretched into the second season.

While I do think Riley Keough does a good job with the material, her character is really written as very wooden and tries to give a sense of nothing affects her.  The really standout points in the season is when that facade cracks and she does start to lose some control.  They also do not make her all that much of a sympathetic lead character who gets in over her head, but a shrewd into all out manipulative one.  She is definitely not a character that you always root for to ""win"".  The tone of the show is much like the tone of the movie.  The soundtrack is very understated most of the time, and the story kind of jumps from one thing to another without always a lot of flow.

For those who do get the blu ray discs, the show looks great.  There are a handful of very short behind the scenes extras, but nothing all that extensive.  It does have a play all mode so you can pick right off where you left off if you end up stopping it.  It is definitely not a show that will appeal to everyone.  It does have its strong points and some weaknesses.  I would suggest streaming an episode or two before you buy the disc to make sure you want to invest in it, unless you saw and really liked the movie and really want to see how they adapted it.",1472083200,17,2016,4.165374677002584
7756205,5,B01G6AS4FU,Loved it. Found the storyline completely fascinating. Can't wait to see what they do with Season 2!,1471305600,4,99,4.882352941176471
7756206,5,B01G6AS4FU,"When I first heard of this show I admit I thought I would hate it. It just did not seem like something I would enjoy. I got bored and decided to watch it one day and found it totally intriguing. So, I immediately watched four more episodes. It is very addicting. Riley's character is a little different, but it makes you continue coming back to see what she will do next.

Can't wait for Season 2!!!",1471046400,7,399,4.25
7756207,4,B01G6AS4FU,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that this review is based on watching the first four (of thirteen) half-hour episodes of THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE.  Im not saying that its not a well-done show.  Its just not my cup of tea.

Riley Keough plays a second year law student, who goes to work as an intern at a major Chicago law firm.  To make ends meet, she also moonlights as a high-priced call girl.  Her situation becomes rather tenuous when her two careers start to inadvertently collide.

I have no doubt that Ms. Keough who, Im told, is the granddaughter of Elvis Presley, is a capable actress, but the way her role is written in this series makes her character quite unlikable.  Indeed, Ive met nobody in the initial four episodes that I care about, and that, for me, is the problem with this series.

The cinematography in the production is certainly unique and interesting.

Paul Sparks and Mary Jane Rajskub are also in the cast.

The two-disc Blu-Ray release is available via Anchor Bay Entertainment.

7756208,4,B01G6AS4FU,"I'm giving it four stars more for style than anything. Dramatically, it's fairly good, and Ms. Keough's deadpan performance (criticized by some) is effective: one even admires her cool under pressure as she contends with difficult clients, office politics and corruption, and the threat of being exposed publicly (though the release of a viral video of her in action is never fully explained). The series' style is cinematic, with ambience given to lighting, colour and spacing. The pacing is episodic, cuts abrupt; most episodes end curtly. As for why she makes her money that way: Sex sells. It's as simple as that.",1507075200,,617,5.0588235294117645
7756209,3,B01G6AS4FU,"Having only caught the first episode while on travel in a hotel, I was intrigued to see what would follow. The plot was meh. Didn't end up liking or hating the main character. Season abruptly ended leaving us with a ""what the heck just happened"" thoughts. Not terribly interested in continuing the next season. The BR quality and packaging were fine.

7756212,3,B01G6AS4FU,"Christine (Riley Keough) is a struggling law student.  When she finds out her friend if an escort, she decides to give it a whirl.  By day, Christine is an intern at a law office.  In the evening, she is a law student.  After that, she moonlights as a high end escort.  It is more than a little difficult to separate the different aspects of her life.  The further down the rabbit hole she goes with the escort girl gig, the more it consumes her.

Riley Keough, is unbelievably gorgeous and she's built like a cheerleader.  She also has the most amazing hair I have ever seen in my life;  she is able to seamlessly go from the ""professional woman"" look to ultra sexy.  Physically, she is perfect for this role.  That said, she does not seem to be a natural actress.  Granted, her stoic performance is due to the fact that her character is a bit ""damaged"" in some areas.  Still, she almost never smiles during the entire series.

The bigger problem with the series is simply the fact that the pacing seems to be off.  Sometimes there is a build-up to a scene with a client in his bedroom & it's treated as an afterthought.  In short, the show is not as salacious as I expected.  Ostensibly, the producers were worried about an over-saturation of Riley being naked.  Let it be known that's impossible!!  They could make several shows where Riley runs around naked the entire time & the show would still hold my interest!!

Typically, when people think of street walkers they think of prostitutes on street corners of the wrong side of town.  This is about the opposite end of the spectrum:  high society escorts ride in expensive sports cars, eat at fancy restaurants, sleep @ 5 Star hotels and go out on yachts with their clients.  The top-of-the-line GFE girls typically have one millionaire or billionaire who is their sugar daddy.  This show is an attempt to show you a glimpse into that lifestyle.",1497916800,,1900,4.553254437869822

7756220,5,B01G6AS4FU,"A beautifully conceived advance on Soderbergh's 2009 film of the same name, this excellent TV series takes the theme of corrosive narcissistic capitalism further, into darker and more unsettling territory. Excellent work by all concerned, this series is likely to test some viewers and anger others, but those who appreciate its serious-minded, non-judgemental, genuinely confrontational (in the very best sense) concerns should find it extremely satisfying. Every contributor to this very fine series should feel justly proud of their work.",1485820800,2,541,5.775

7756223,4,B01G6AS4FU,"""The Girlfriend Experience"" is a hard series to define - and perhaps even harder to recommend. I'm not saying it's a bad show - it's actually a very good one, hence four stars. But it's good in a very precise and specific way, one that will most definitely not appeal to the majority of the audience who would even give it a chance. It takes a subject that is considered taboo or even distasteful and, instead of attempting to make it palatable or commercialized, explores it in complex and sometimes off-putting ways. I was mesmerized by it, but enjoyment is perhaps a bit of a stretch.

I don't feel the need to summarize or set up the plot of the series - that's been done elsewhere - except to call it a woman's journey to self-realization. Or, as executive producer Stephen Soderbergh might say, an origin story. Christine Reade's transformation from smart, ambitious law intern to empowered, emboldened provider (the show's term for the girlfriend experience) is fascinating and unnerving. It twists and turns not only in terms of plot, but in what it chooses to show and withhold. Huge chunks of time go by between scenes - each episode uses its thirty minutes in the most efficient way possible - and characters come and go as needed without much explanation. What holds it all together is Riley Keough's towering performance, speaking volumes with the most minute expressions and gestures. She invests Christine with suggestions of an entire lifetime using nothing but her face. I'd argue that she makes the show; at the very least, she forms its center, if not quite its heart.

This is the thing you have to understand about The Girlfriend Experience: it's not interested in letting you in, or making a statement about the life of a call girl, or doing anything other than what serves its own interests. The cinematography, while gorgeous, has an inherent remove; people are often filmed through windows, or framed in doorways, emphasizing their closed-off nature. The writing, too, is deeply controlled. At the end of the season, you won't know much more about Christine than you did going in, and that's the point. You probably won't even like her very much - no one is all that sympathetic, and most are morally compromised in some way, but we're following Christine as she lies, manipulates, and seduces to get what she wants. We see the choices she makes and how they affect others, but aside from a few small but revealing moments of honesty, we'll never know why. We're just not allowed.

People going into this to be titillated will come away disappointed as well. The sex scenes, frequent yet brief, are occasionally as graphic as they can get without becoming smut (the kind of restraint the 50 Shades series could stand to learn). But as with the films of David Mackenzie they're coldly distant, a transaction between consenting adults who acknowledge it without words. In fact, one or two scenes are downright uncomfortable. The one thing they aren't, however, is exploitative. This is a choice that Christine has consciously made and, with a couple exceptions, she has total control of her clients in bed. This isn't a show about sex so much as what it can represent, what it means to the characters and how they use or react to it.

And maybe that's what Christine's journey is: learning just how comfortable she is with her sexuality and what it can do for her - how powerful it makes her. I'm only guessing, because The Girlfriend Experience has no interest in telling me if I'm right or not. The final scene is so ambiguous that it, and the entire season leading up to that moment, are open to multiple interpretations. You'll be challenged by The Girlfriend Experience, you'll be left feeling cold, and if you're okay with that, you might even be entertained. It's up to you if you want to find out.",1483833600,,3828,4.760542168674699

7756226,1,B01G6AS4FU,"I understand that the ""creators"" of this show didn't come up with the title as the show was ripped off from a movie, but what a stupid title nonetheless. There's NOTHING about this wretched, soft-core cable TV porn trash that even remotely resembles a ""girlfriend experience,"" unless of course you happen to pay your girlfriend to perform all manner of sex acts whilst ordering her about like a slave. In that case it would be apt. Still, I suppose the ""creators"" of the show deserve some credit for assembling a cast of the finest Canadian actors they could find (the ones who remained in Canada, that is, because they couldn't cut it in the US market), along with Chloe from ""24."" Now that Jack Bauer is out of commission, no doubt she needed the paycheck. Anyway, I can't see how anyone could recommend this garbage as there's not a single likeable or sympathetic character to be had anywhere in sight. Each episode is pretty much a carbon copy of the previous, save the pilot of course, with some contrived personal drama, and of course the inevitable pretend humping. Honestly, the ONLY reason to watch is to see the Alicia Silverstone lookalike who plays the prostitute take her clothes off. Period. It cracks me up how they sell this as drama when it's obviously just soft-core porn. Why don't they just go all in? The show is on cable, they could get away with it if they wanted. Just look at some of the filth HBO has been airing. Instead, they want to make a veggie burger look desirable when what the viewer would likely prefer is a real burger, with cheese and bacon at that. The pitiful thing is that the story of Christine is worth telling and might even have been compelling, if the job had been undertaken by talented writers and all the pretend TV sex left out. But who'd want to watch that?",1481414400,3,1808,4.549079754601227
