8244353,5,B00126P0JM,"""Tormento"" is an accurate adaptation of the novel by the same title penned by Benito Prez Galds, Spain's answer to Charles Dickens. An anticlerical story, the title refers to the name a priest gave the lead character, Amparo, with whom the priest carried on a torrid affair. Amparo is the ward of relatives whose cousin, Agustn Caballero, made a fortune in America and is now being eyed by his greedy cousin Rosala as a potential husband for her own young daughter or, in the event she should become a widow, herself. Eventually gossip mongers will reveal secrets that will imperil Agustn and Amparo's romance. Concha Velasco, as the hateful Rosala, is superb; Ana Beln and Francisco Rabal are also outstanding in their portrayals of Amparo and Agustn, respecctively. This novel's story is continued in ""La de Bringas "" (That Bringas Woman), which exposes bourgeois hypocrisy and turns the Bringas household into a mirror of Isabel II's spendthrift reign in the 1860s, just before she was ousted during the Revolution of 1968. Too bad it's only available in PAL!",1332979200,,1062,4.97191011235955
