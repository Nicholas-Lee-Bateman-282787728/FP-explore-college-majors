She speaks slowly, gracefully with beautiful outdoor locations to look at. She performs them in colorful outfits & too much makeup, but we can blame the producers for that. She is always correct in knowing where you will feel the energy during & after the pose. She also tells you what the poses help your body with to keep you going if it seems hard. The pace if very slow & relaxed & she lets you take short breaks in between each one.
This one like her others has a play feature, extras contains: tell you seperately in pics what the asana helps with for organs or muscles, extra info on how to do it, customizing the working by deciding which poses to do or do repeatedly, guidelines/helpful hints if tired/weak & temperature of the room, fan speak/testimonials & more items to buy.
The poses are: arrow, bowing cobbler, plank, bridge, sidways leg lifts, reverse awwor, fish, knee to outside of arm, triangle, folding triangle, bulldog, sidebends, camel, lion & ends as always with a 5 min meditation/chant.
