750329,1,6303979572,"I had actually seen this film at a midnite show in an old grindhouse, so I had fond memories of it. I had the VHS tape, so I figured why not get the DVD? Yeah, regretting my ass off on that purchase. Worse than any tenth generation bootleg, this tape sucks on every level, from the picture quality, the sound, dropouts, and the titles bleed off to the side. The tape source must have been found in the trunk of a 1980 something Toyota Corolla that was just pulled out of a junkyard. My VHs is pristine compared to this, and they want 19.95 for it? It isn't like they couldn't find a decent VHS tape source, they are right on this site. Another cheap out release that just screws the fans and kill any credibility Full Moon had. Spend that $20 in a strip club, at least you'll see something.",1339200000,24,790,4.23841059602649
750330,1,6303979572,"While I am a huge supporter of this film of trailers, I cannot recommend this DVD at all. The quality is sub par VHS. I own a dupe of this VHS movie that looks three times better than this release. I would have gladly sold my copy to the company who released this as it looks much, much better.",1326153600,22,294,4.0
750331,5,6303979572,"This collection of trailers is probably one of the best ever made. It is old, was released in the 1980s but it is chock full of good, bad, terrible and terribly funny movie previews. Let's see here, you've got zombies, monsters, raunchy babes getting briefly nekkid, explosions, weird rhyming narration with many of the trailers. The funniest ones on here are the blaxploitation movies: Dr Black and Mr Hyde, and of course the Rudy Ray Moore/Dolemite flicks.

The experience is greatly enhanced by the presence of an aged but humourous John Carradine. This legendary film star has been in all kinds of movies over the years, from the original Grapes of Wrath to The Howling to Vampire Hookers. You can tell he was having fun introducing the various segments and one of his sons even shows up to lend support.

I have friends who like these kinds of grindhouse-drive in-exploitation movies and we quoted lines from some of these previews for years...in fact, we still use some of the funnier lines. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

750643,5,6303979572,Hands down one of the best trailer collections ever put together. Sadly the VHS copy OF a copy I have that is several years old is in MUCH better condition than the copy used to create this DVD release. It's seems hard to believe that Mr. Charles Band did not have access to a better quality copy of HIS film to use for this release. The crop factor used is even tighter than the version I have. The picture appears like it was zoomed in on?.. POOR transfer. This is such a great collection. Very broad based. Great classic 70's B-movie mix. The use of John Carradine as the host appearing between the segments is very entertaining.. Such a damn shame about the garbage transfer. I would happily pick this collection up on Blu ray if it were to ever be made available. I wish it was at least as clean as a new VHS copy. If you haven't seen this collection.. I still think it's worth a few bucks to see it.. Even if you only watch it once and then throw it in the trash after seeing the death duel of the black titans on Terminal Island. So much amazing and hilarious dialog contained in these trailers.. So damned entertaining. It's worth a look.(* asterisk required)...,1375142400,9,1170,4.371559633027523
750644,2,6303979572,"Charlie Band does it again. He takes a tape master and transfers it onto DVD. Don't look for crystal clarity here, just trailers and scenes from horror films that were released by Wizard Video on VHS in the early-80's.",1359504000,11,218,4.615384615384615

7858140,1,6303979572,"I can think of at least 3 things wrong with this DVDs title! (Thanks Nelson Muntz!) Terrible video transfer from VHS totally ruins it. The trailers are from 70s and 80s grindhouse//drive-in movies. Some are fun to see, but with only a couple of exceptions they are certainly not the ""best of sex and violence"". Since I can't give it zero stars, I'll justify the one star by noting that it was fun to see host John Carradine (though the jokes were terrible) and the trailers from Rudy Ray Moore movies were sufficiently odd.

I remember seeing the box for this video at my local video rental store in the 90s. I really wanted to rent it, but the tape was never there. I assumed someone had stolen the tape. Seeing it on Amazon recently at relatively cheap price, I bought a copy. Now that I've finally seen it after all these years I kinda feel let down, Imagine that, an exploitation video that's a rip-off!",1521849600,,907,4.463855421686747
