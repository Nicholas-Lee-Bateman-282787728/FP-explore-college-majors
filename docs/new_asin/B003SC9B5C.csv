8404301,4,B003SC9B5C,"Bought this dvd as half of it has Dusty Springfield performances (mostly lip sync) on it.  Really bought it as was told there was a short rare interview of Dusty on it. I already had all of the Dusty performances that were on this DVD.  Turns out the interview of Dusty was probably less than one minute long.  The media caught her getting off the plane in Australia in 1967.  Interviewers were aggressive and very accusatory, a real pain.  However, Dusty handled it very well and even got a good laugh out of it in the end.  Dvd is half Dusty and half Gerry and the Pacemakers.  There are good interviews at the end of the DVD by Simon Bell and Madeline Bell and Bacharach talking about Dusty. Bacharach lamenting that he wanted to do one last LP with Dusty but she turned him down as she wasn't feeling up to it in the late 1990's.  To bad he didn't try to do the LP in the 1980's instead.  That would have been really something.",1482192000,,931,4.274285714285714
