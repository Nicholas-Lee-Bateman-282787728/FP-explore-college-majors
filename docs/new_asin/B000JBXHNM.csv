8149474,5,B000JBXHNM,This made a great gift for my enthusiast. But it only covers a brief part of the history not the most recent (like past decade of history) in depth. But really really cool to see the start of the company and how it changed !,1389052800,,224,4.0
8149475,4,B000JBXHNM,"For those who value the quality of (most) BMW cars, this DVD is very informative. It show the history of the BMW co and how they manage to produce a great car despite the hardships of the wars.",1359849600,,193,4.105263157894737
8149476,4,B000JBXHNM,"This DVD is another episode in the History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series. Generally, it's a good series that covers a marque in a relatively comprehensive fashion.

This DVD covers BMW from it's beginnings as an aircraft motor manufacturer. BMW moved into consumer products as a motorcycle manufacturer then moved to automobiles beginning with a liscence-built copy of the little ""Dixie"" auto in the 1920's.

The DVD does a fairly good job of covering the elegant BMW's from the 30's as well as touching upon their aircraft division from WWI to WWII. It continues after the war with the company's struggles in a devastated Germany with some questionable business decisions. We see the postwar BMW's as small, microcars and cars powered essentially by large motorcycle engines or, at the other end of the spectrum, cars that are simply too expensive for the average German of that era to afford.

In the 60's, we see BMW becoming the ""sport sedan"" maker with their ""new range"" cars that really began to make BMW the company we associate with image of the ""ultimate driving machine"". Thus begins the trend toward sedans with good power and excellent handling - with Italian styling, no less!

The only problem I had with this video is that it essentially stops in the 1970's and the viewer does not get to see the BMW's come to fruition in the late 70's and 80's. They just stopped the story too early!

If you are interested in the history of BMW and it's design philosophy, this DVD is a fairly good place to start. I recommend this with four stars.",1303516800,,1550,4.768656716417911
8149477,3,B000JBXHNM,"This is a decent History Channel show on the EARLY days of BMW - really through their break into the US market with the 2002.  The DVD covers the founding of BMW, their wartime aircraft background, and the development of their car lines from the beginning of the century to 1976.  While the picture on the cover shows a very modern BMW, you won't get anything on any models or history after about 1976 - so be aware when buying that your M3, M5, Z roadster or whatever modern Bimmer you drive won't be on there...",1270425600,2,513,4.333333333333333

BMW gets typical History Channel treatment. This very good overview of BMW starts at its very beginning in 1916. Coverage of the war periods (WWI & II) was particularly interesting. Yes, they address the Hitler thing (this IS the Hitler - oops, I mean History - Channel!). It includes archival footage, photos, and recreations complete with sets, period costumes, and actors driving early models, which I assume are perfect restorations. Seeing those rare, early models (some of which I've only seen in books, and rarely) being actually driven is a very nice addition. Some of the trivia is surprising - History Channel of course did their homework. Lovely footage all around, and the racing footage is impressive (sometimes humorous). There are even early commercials, and footage of workers on the factory floor. It goes decade by decade and covers every model - but here's the catch - they stopped with the mid-1970's series'. I was disappointed that they didn't go further. The late 70's - early 80's brought the M-Technik (Motorsport) cars to the street, and also brought the landmark M30 engine (I have a 1984 533i) - arguably BMW's best days as far as reliability goes. I also wanted to see what they had to say about the recent controversial design changes brought on by Chris Bangle. Has not enough time passed? I still recommend this DVD pretty highly.",1235347200,9,1511,5.4297872340425535
