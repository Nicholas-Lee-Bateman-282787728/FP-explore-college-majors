4712806,5,B005JJCMO4,"Although I was only four years old when this series came out, I love this show.
Several years ago I purchased The Man From Uncle complete series collection, and
enjoyed it very much. I had heard over the years about The Girl From Uncle, but
had not seen it. Thank goodness Warner Archives brought it out. I don't mind
the higher price in this case because I love Stephanie Powers. My mom and wife
loved Hart to Hart, and I always wondered how she would have looked in the 60's.
Quality is fantastic (just like Man From Uncle). By the way, I would love to
see 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, or even Maverick released on demand. For you
trivia buffs, Noel Harrison (co-star of Girl from Uncle) had a minor hit in 1967
with a song called ""Suzanne"". This set comes in paramount like cases (Fugitive,
Rawhide ect..).",1323302400,12,811,4.449664429530201
4712807,1,B005JJCMO4,"""April Dancer"" was one of the two names created by Ian Fleming when he met with the Producer, Norman Felton, about the possibility of creating a spy series for tv (the other name being ""Napoleon Solo"")  The name April Dancer, The Girl from U.N.C.L.E., is also a symbol about everything that went wrong with the brother series during its third season and what went wrong with this series during its first and thankfully, only season.
I watched and loved ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" since the night it premiered on NBC in September 1964.  It is still my all-time favorite tv series.  The pilot of ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E."" was shown as an episode of ""Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" ""The Moonglow Affair"" when UNCLE was still riding high during its second season Friday nights.  UNCLE was already veering dangerously toward ""camp"" during the later part of season two.  However this was still a fairly serious episode.  Beautiful ex-Miss America Mary Ann Mobley played April and Norman Fell played an older, more experienced Mark Slate.  When the series was picked up however, Mobley was deemed too young and inexperienced and replaced with Stefanie Powers.  Fell was deemed too old and was replaced with British David McCallum-clone, Noel Harrison, the son of Rex.
""Girl"" premiered in 1966 when the Batman phenomenon was the talk of tv.  While ""Man"" at least had one fantastic first season and a fairly decent second season before its disastrous third (camp) season, ""Girl"" started at the bottom of the barrel with its first episode.  The high point that season was a ridiculous episode with Robert Vaughn as Solo, ""The Mother Muffin Affair"" featuring Boris Karloff in drag.  The show was horrible from start to finish.
I remember being upset that ""Girl"" was up against one of my other favorite shows ""Combat"" Tuesday nights.  Since there was no DVR in those days, one had to choose.  Since I loved ""U.N.C.L.E.,"" I went with ""Girl.""  After about 4 episodes, I was back watching ""Combat"" again.
Predictably, with ridiculous scripts and a lead character that couldn't fight her may out of a paper bag, it was not surprising that NBC cancelled this show after just 1 season.  Its failure also didn't help its brother series which was also on its last legs.  However, in its 4th. season, U.N.C.L.E.'s producers finally came to their senses and turned the series back into the action-packed, fairly serious adventure that the whole world grew to love its first season.  However it was too late and the damage was done, U.N.C.L.E. failed miserably against a revived ""Gunsmoke"" and ""The Lucy Show"" Monday nights.  It was cancelled in mid-season and was replaced by ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In"" in January 1970.
As stated previously, there is absolutely nothing I can say positive about this series: it was a total mess.  It didn't have to be one.  Before this series, we already had 2 female characters, Emma Peel and Honey West, kicking butt on tv.  However, those were played fairly seriously, (if ""The Avengers"" could ever be called serious,) and this was not.  At least Stefanie Powers went on to better things.  (I met her at a Chiller Theatre show a couple years back and she was very nice.)
In conclusion, if you want to buy a very silly, poorly written and all-around fiasco of a tv series, then pick up ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E."" DVD set right away.",1321488000,13,3339,4.829525483304042

4712811,4,B005JJCMO4,"Norman Felton, the co-creator of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (1964-68), wanted to capitalize on the phenomenal popularity of the TV series, by spinning off another spy adventure series featuring a woman as the lead.  The result was The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. (1966-67), which lasted just a single season, and featured Stephanie Powers as agent April Dancer, and Noel Harrison as her partner Mark Slate.  Like their fellow U.N.C.L.E. agents Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum), Dancer and Slate received their assignments from Mr. Waverly (Leo G. Carroll).

The first appearance of the characters April Dancer and Mark Slate, was in the second season of The Man From U.N.C.L.E., in an episode called The Moonglow Affair (Episode #52, 1966).  Interestingly different actors were cast in both roles, with Mary Ann Mobley appearing as April Dancer, and Norman Fell as Mark State.  The episode has a different tone and dynamic between Dancer and Slate, than would later be seen in the series.  Rather than being equals, Dancer is inexperienced in the field, while State is much older, a little out of shape, and definitely an American.

The creators retooled and recast the series, and went with a more hip, cool, and irreverent tone.  The agents became closer in age and experience, and Slate became British.  Mary Ann Mobley, a former Miss America, was replaced with the beautiful and athletic Stephanie Powers, who was a textbook example of a southern California girl.  Powers looked great in casual attire, outrageous contemporary fashions, or spectacular in formal attire.  Sexy, but with a sassiness and edge, Powers was no pushover, and had goods to tackle playing the lead in the spy spoof.  The son of actor Rex Harrison (Dr. Doolittle), Noel Harrison at about 30 years of age, already had an impressive resume.  A past member of the British Olympic skiing team, Harrison was also an accomplished singer, musician and actor.  Being British, and in very good physical condition, the dashing Harrison was obviously a big change from Norman Fell.  Together, Powers and Harrison make a solid and attractive team, in the battle against the dreaded forces of THRUSH.

By its third season (1966-67), The Man From U.N.C.L.E. had evolved to feature a less serious, more comedic approach to espionage.  The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. also adopted a similar approach, stressing humor and some wacky plots, over more serious stories grounded in reality.  While the series initially found some success in the ratings, the program finished the season ranked near the bottom, and was cancelled.  With the 60's spy craze winding down, the same fate also befell  The Man From U.N.C.L.E., as it was cancelled midway through its fourth season.

Notable guest stars appearing in The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. included Bernard Fox, Casare Danova, Kurt Kaznar, Peggy Lee, Wally Cox, Boris Karloff, Fernando Lamas, Shelly Berman, Nanette Fabray, Dom LeLuise, Leslie Uggams, Edward Mulhare, Lucianna Paluzzi, Lloyd Bochner, Joyce Jameson, Broderick Crawford, Sabrina Scharf, Victor Buono, Yvonne DeCarlo, and Vito Scotti.

The 29 episodes of The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. are broken up into two sets, each with four discs, currently selling for $44.95 each.  At about $90 for the season, that averages to around $3.10 per episode, which is a little steep.  Compare this to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-from-U-N-C-L-E-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00005JM5Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;which once sold for $250, and has now dropped to about $130, and contains all four seasons of the program, totaling 105 episodes, on 41 discs.  The average cost per episode, is about $1.21.  This fantastic set is highly recommended, and often goes on sale at Amazon.  While The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. is a fun series, unless you are a really dedicated fan, you might want to wait until the price drops a bit, which it inevitably will.",1316217600,2,4006,5.347687400318979

4712813,5,B005JJCMO4,"What a long awaited treat! The successful The Man From U.N.C.L.E. had one very unsuccessful spin off- the one hour show- The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.. This obscure spin off lasted a very short one season. During The Man From U.N.C.L.E., two new characters were brought into the episode, THE MOONGLOW AFFAIR which filmed in December of 1965. The characters were April Dancer played by former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley and Mark Slate played by Norman Fell (Mr. Roper from Three's Company). These two characters would go on to do their own series, The Girl From U.N.C.L.E., in the next year in 1966. The producers found the inexperienced Mobley and the ordinary Norman Fell to be less exciting than the pair they wanted to portray in the new Girl From U.N.C.L.E. series. They found a much more hip and mod couple in a 23 year old Stephanie Powers, who spoke several languages fluently, which was an asset to the accents she would need working in all the foreign countries in the episodes, and a 32 year old very British Noel Harrison (Noel is the son of Rex Harrison). Added to the couple of April Dancer (Powers) and Mark Slate (Harrison) was the U.N.C.L.E. boss himself -Alexander Waverly played by Leo G. Carroll.

Although the stories were pure camp, the first two episodes did well in the Nielsen ratings at #24, followed by #30 for the next two episodes. By the 5th episode, the show plummeted down into the bottom numbers, which led to it's cancellation for a second season. Stephanie Powers was always blamed for it's cancellation, as she never made good comments for the press and was not thrilled with the show's crazy, silly unbelievable stories and campiness. Even in the successful first episode-The Dog-Gone Affair, THRUSH develops a drug that causes people to move in slow motion and the anecdote that April must bring is on a flea that is on a dog.

Aside from the campy silly stories, the show spared no expenses with many great guest stars and a $1,000.00 per episode wardrobe budget for Miss Powers. Stephanie Powers mod wardrobe came directly from Carnaby Street in London and she had gorgeous costumes for all the characters she had to play like a daughter of a sheik, a belly dancer or a stewardess. One thing that April Dancer lacked was the ability to get the bad guys. April always played the bait for THRUSH agents, she had compacts and earrings with sleeping gas- but all the fighting was done by her partner Mark Slate. The Avengers Emma Peele did all her own fighting, where April Dancer was always a damsel in distress, making her a weak personality for the already weak story lines. Audiences saw the direct copying off the successful Batman Show, with it's cartoony characters and silly plots, which just didn't work in a spy-fi series as it did for Batman, which was based on a cartoon.

As campy as this show was, it will be great to see Stephanie Powers and Noel Harrison up against the bad guys again and all the THRUSH agents. In the third episode, The Mother Muffin Affair, you'll see Powers teamed up with U.N.C.L.E.'s Robert Vaughn to battle Mother Muffin- Boris Karloff in drag! From only one short year of filming, you'll be treated to a guest star list that is quite incredible, as these episodes included: Edward Asner, Joan Blondell, Tom Bosley, John Carradine, Jack Cassidy, Ellen Corby, Wally Cox, Dom DeLuise, Boris Karloff, Peggy Lee, Fernando Lamas, Gena Rowlands, Ann Sothern, Leslie Uggams, Robert Vaughn, Carol Wayne, Michael Wilding, Yvonne DeCarlo and more.

Warner Brothers is producing this one year Series in a two part disc set. They have divided the series in half and are making the set available together or separately. The Warner Brothers website is selling them together, where Amazon is selling them separately, and the TCM website is selling them together. The prices are all different, so you'll have to shop around. Each half set includes 4 discs, which is 8 discs total. The episodes are made on demand, which means they will only make them as they are ordered and not in mass quantities. These type of sets are always difficult to find in the future, so if you are interested in The Girl From U.N.C.L.E., don't miss out now, as it will be short lived, just as it was in 1966-1967. Warner Brothers website has a sample of the video quality of this show, if you want to see it before you order. Warner Brothers has made this show from the best quality video masters they could find, but it is not restored or remastered, so view before you buy. I looked at the sample and it looks great!

I have waited to see this wonderful campy show for decades and I can't wait to see all the great guest stars along with Noel Harrison and a very young Stephanie Powers with her fabulous mod Carnaby Street wardrobe. A huge Thank You to Warner Brothers for bringing back this fun show!

Poorly written scripts, cheap production values, disinterested and uneven acting, and very little to rally around except for the aforementioned Powers whose luminescent beauty always shines through. I realize that this show is supposed to be a lighthearted spoof, but many of the episodes fail to reach even that low bar. Also, for $21 Amazon ought to be selling the entire series, not one half of one season. Full disclosure: I've only watched the first 6 episodes. Maybe the next 9 will be better.

Stefanie Powers is smart, looks great, and is obviously having a good time; Noel Harrison lends a bit more Bond-style grit to the action. The plots and plot twists are (ahem) improbable, but that's part of the fun. Well worth getting if you like this kind of thing at all.",1517184000,2,444,4.5625

Leo J. Carroll seems bored and disinterested in this series. There isn't much chemistry between Stefanie Powers and her English co star.

8475782,3,B005JJCMO4,Stephanie Powers and Noel Harrison have great chemistry but sadly they are let down by an obviously lower budget than Man from Uncle and very poor scripts. The endless succession of painfully comic villains gets very tedious very quickly- the worst being Boris Karloff in drag as Mother Muffin. I am most of the way through this set and still have the second box to start and it is tough going. If you have the complete Man from Uncle box set and want to have the whole Man from Uncle phenomenon you will need these two Girl sets and the movies collection- but be prepared to spin this series put a bit-  whisky helps. Picture quality is excellent and kudos to Warners for actually giving this a limited release.,1507161600,,712,4.51937984496124

8475784,5,B005JJCMO4,"If you watch TV in the 1960s and had a crush on April Dancer; this DVD is for you!  I remember bits of the episodes shown here on this DVD.  It pretty good quality for not being HD.  April Dancer aka Stefanie Powers is very attractive at 23 years old in the show's episodes and her role is basically a sex symbol type agent since she does almost no hand to hand combat in any of the episodes.  She just uses her attractiveness to subdue the male opposition as well as UNCLE device like spray can of knock out gas, small bombs and such devices.  She does not shoot people either.  Only shooting done by her is for cover fire so Mark Slate can do the dirty work.  Plots are laughable, not seriously presented but entertaining.  I may buy the second part too but it is very pricey for what you get!  Seeing Stefanie Powers sexual powers in her prime with the best body and a very attractive face at 23-24 years of age is probably worth the heavy price tag.  It only lasted one season however.  It too bad that the showrunners did not portray April Dancer like that of Emilly Peel and Honors Blackman of The Avengers!  I think the show would have done much better in the TV ratings and would have latest more then a year!",1499472000,,1217,4.243478260869566
8475785,3,B005JJCMO4,If you enjoy the silly spy stuff of that era then you'd love this.  We liked it at first but it got way too goofy for us....sort of reminiscent of Get Smart or Hogans Heros.,1498867200,,173,3.942857142857143
