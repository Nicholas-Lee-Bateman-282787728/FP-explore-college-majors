8153484,5,B000JWFGV2,"VINCENT PRICE'S DRACULA - The title shudders up a lot more than just the Count himself ! You can see Price having an absolute BALL telling us about the dreaded Vlad than we do watching ! However , I always did seem to enjoy a program a tad more if the actors or host were reveling in it . And this Price does well . The historical content is compelling , to say the least . Even if a few scenes were lifted from other documentaries , it all works perfectly .
I did enjoy the many old film clip[s that show up in the last 20 minuetes or so - I recall as a child watching many of these classic horrors on late - night T.V. - you know , when we had VHF & UHF T.V., decades before the Digital boom . It all brought back those wonderful childhood memories of Mr. Price , Mr. Poe and my favorite magazine , FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND .
I highly recommend this Video to all you Baby - Boomer kids out there , and to the NEW generation who never knew Vincent or Vlad .*****Dave Baker , March 26 , 2010",1269561600,2,994,3.9502487562189055
8153485,5,B000JWFGV2,"Absolutely delightful documentary hosted by one of Fright Film's greatest,Vincent Price.

I discovered this tape when I was six years old at a Jamesway Department Store,and had gotten it as a present for being good in school.

To say this film had a profound impact upon my young,impressionable mind is something of an understatement.

While cheesy in many ways,it's also so strangely entertaining that it has become a cult favorite among my friends at Halloween time!

The film has that creepy,grainy quality of the early 80s,and has a wonderful intro as we are driven by carriage to Vincent Price's castle(!) for him to discuss the legend of Dracula.

The documentary focuses largely on the story of Vlad Tepes(Vlad the Impaler) and his life,through some cool footage from some Romanian epic made about him in the late 70s.

Dracula,The Great Undead,also focuses on the creation of Stoker's novel,with scenes from Nosferatu(1922) to illustrate some passages(which it does quite well) and many of the other film versions are explored.
All of them are Black and White classics like Vampyr(1932),Mark of the Vampire(1935),Return of the Vampire(1944),The Vampire(1957) and Return of Dracula(1958).

There is also coverage of Romania's link to vampirism and a trip to Vlad Dracul's burial place in Snagoc monastery,which is rather eerie.

This VHS is alot of fun for the horror fan who wishes to seek out some creepy and informative fun on everyone's favorite bloodsucker.

And Mr. Price is ALWAYS a delight to watch,so pull up a chair and spend an evening with Price as he gives you all the information you need to know about the Count.

Have fun!",1228521600,2,1645,5.059259259259259
