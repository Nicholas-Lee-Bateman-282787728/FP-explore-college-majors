2554741,5,B000F8O2RY,"This show is the best! It's a cartoon for adults, but series creator Aaron McGruder provides a biting look at life and life's situations through Huey, Riley and Granddad's eyes. It's honest and funny all at once. Good show!",1405728000,,223,4.743589743589744
2554742,5,B000F8O2RY,"Those who were worried about the strip-to-screen translation, fear not. What started out pretty much the same way as Gary Trudeau's Doonesbury and Berkeley ""Mastah-Penguin-Drawer"" Breathed's Bloom County (as a college strip gone daily syndicate) ends up being one of the most eligible candidates for the all-time ""I-can't-believe-they-showed-this-on-television"" award.

Wicked, vicious, scathing, uncompromising, cautionary, the list of adjectives rolls on. My personal experience was when a girlfriend tried telling me that there was a new show out there featuring a guy who was the inverse of Michael Jackson (take a wild guess who).

Nothing could have prepared me for the absolute giggle-and-snicker-fest that was the first season of ""The Boondocks"". From the first few moments of ""The Garden Party"" to the last strains of ""The Passion of Reverend Ruckus"", not a single punch is pulled, not one oblique afro-american (yeah, pardon the archaism) culture reference un-called-upon. Everyone has their pet episode of Boondocks, and chances are, more than likely, it is a first season episode; indeed, talk about one of those shows that has a person smiling years later just thinking about one of the gags. The voice acting is brilliant, the writing is stunning, and every episode stands on its own as a masterpiece.

Well worth every penny and subsequent viewing. One could not recommend this one more.

Oh, and definitely _not_ for kids. :)",1405728000,,1441,5.3628318584070795

2554745,5,B000F8O2RY,"I have one thing to say: if you review this show badly, you need to watch more. This entire series not only the first season, is something everyone should see. Many will review this show negative reviews because some may not agree sigh the political views, but even some conservatives I know laugh at the show, as it is always funny. I am white, and many other white people will hate this show, but many more will still be able to appreciate the politics and humor in it. Even if you are white, you should at least try it and you will most likely like it. The show is a gem in my and many of my friend's opinions. I cannot stress enough how much better THE BOONDOCKS gets season after season, to spite starting at such a high level of quality. So order this and prepare to get offended, get stuck into uncontrollable laughing fits, to think about the political views of the great minds behind this show and most of all, prepare to adjust your own if you are a conservative, and feel stronger as a liberal.",1403568000,2,1005,4.322751322751323

If this was a white show and the use of the N word were abused, it would be pulled off the airwaves & all hell would break loose. There is no excuse for this pile of excrement and no way is it justified in all the RACIEST OVERTONES IT PROMOTES!

Definitely ahead of it's time with regards to cartoons in it's era, and reminds me of the old Wait 'Til Your Father Gets Home for it's adult humor. There was a reason this show was shown on Adult Swim (Cartoon Network), back in the day.

2554757,5,B000F8O2RY,"This show rocks! WARNING OFFENSIVE AND EXPLICIT! This is a great show but it should be noted this is NOT FOR KIDS it is an adult show that is very humorous and random. There jokes pertaining to : ethnicity, religion and politics and there is also violent slapstick. If you take offense to these things then this is not for you.  However Boondocks fans and for people who want to laugh at these things will get a kick out of this show.

2554787,5,B000F8O2RY,"I'll be honest, I had never heard of this show until one night I happened to flick the channel, and there it was, the ""Fried Chicken"" episode...and so I was hooked.

Long story short, the show is all about grandpa Freeman and his two grand sons, Huey and Riley, whom move to the surburbs to have a ""better"" life, but viewers be warned, this shows will push buttons you didn't know you had. The ""N"" word will thrown through out the show; political, social and everyday issues will be portraited in a manner reflecting what real people would say, and not some staged group of actors/voices.

The BoonDocks had me laughing so hard, I was literally crying, just whatch ""The Story Of Gangstalicious"" and you'll see what I'm talking about.

All in all. A great show for those with a true sense of humour, those whom can see beyond what's supposed to be politically right and see things as they truly are.",1356393600,,898,4.530864197530864

2554794,5,B000F8O2RY,"I've always been a fan of The Boondocks. The anime inspired animation, voice actors, and storylines all add to the overall greatness of this cartoon. When I originally watched the series, it was pretty much for entertainment. After revisiting the first season, I realize how much more social commentary on Black culture and pop culture in general flowed through the veins of each episode. Many of the topics addressed are still highly relevant today (somewhat unfortunately in some respects) and even caused me to take a new look at some recent history, which is why I consider it a class cartoon.

Regina King does a great job voicing the Freeman brothers, and John Witherspoon keeps me in stiches! This show is very funny and entertaining, I can't stop watching it!!!!! I have all three seasons, and I'm looking forward to season four! Favorite characters: Huey, Riley, Granddad, Uncle Ruckus, and Tom.",1350691200,,482,4.75
2554796,4,B000F8O2RY,"This is one of the essential episodes that defines Boondocks as the edgy daring work of social and political commentary it is.  It opens with straight arrow Asst. District Attorney Tom facing his childhood nightmare --getting arrested and fearing the prospect of prison rape. When Huey and Riley get involved in clearing his name, we're off on a harrowing and hilarious ride as the episode reveals it true intentions --- a smart biting satirical observation of a certain war we know so well.

Samuel L Jackson and Eddie Murphy's brother Charlie from the Chapelle Show lend their voices to great effect. The profanity is absolutely unsuitable for a kids but pitched to underscore the profanity of the politics it satirizes. If you're not attuned to Bush era politics, the metaphors will sail completely over your head. (And for that I'd pity you) On the other hand if you are painfully aware you will feel a knowing elbow nudged in your ribs every few seconds in this long and oh so dry inside joke. ""Don't you see? They're ROBBING the place!"" Uh, huh.",1349222400,,1051,4.769230769230769

His mentor challenges him using some rather sly forms of reverse psychology, and even abets Riley on a few of his artistic misadventures (indeed, with each being more outrageous and hair-raising than the last).

In the end, Riley's mentor brings out the best in the youth, and as usual, Grandpa Freeman is there to curb his enthusiasm.  This was a top-notch episode all around.",1337299200,,531,4.943820224719101

2554815,5,B000F8O2RY,"The one thing I always love about the The Boondocks, is that it's hilarious and educational, if you pay attention to the message within the comedy. The Comics have a sensible way explaining it, while the TV show goes over the top of explaining it. And these messages usually deals with real life issues within the world of pop culture,  the entertainment industry, the music industry, and how society just basically falls into the nonsense of it all in the end. Now depending on how you look at the show way of explaining these issue, you will either love it, or hate it. There will always be a hilarious joke that can be either, offensive, rude, or down right insulting, but like the old saying goes ""The truth hurts"" and The Boondocks isn't afraid too tell you it.

Those who call this racist, I pity you more than anything. I pity the surface level thinking. For those who call this nothing but comedy, I also pity you. It is funny, down right hillarious.

2554838,5,B000F8O2RY,"This is one of the Greatest shows on Television. It is a comical look at the culture of both white and black people. From the beginning it shows the ignorance on both sides of the spectrum and point out the faults in today's society while still being funny.

However, there are those who think they see through the show to nothing more than a shallow interior and to those people I say get a grip. This show is well written and brilliantly original. The Characters are much deeper than made out to be, however you all have gotten it into your ignorant skulls that they are nothing more than trash talking fools. You cannot see how each character has been specifically molded based on their backgrounds and their environment. So get a grip if you don't like this show than you cannot watch south park either cause it is just as offensive.

Despite the few ones this DVD is NOT ignorant dribble from an angry minority, but a close, careful, and comical look at the faults with black culture as well as a broader look at the faults with the greater society.",1215302400,,1054,4.484375

On occasion, the French subtitles (there are no English subtitles, sadly) pop-up... for no reason. At all.

I think this is great for collectors, but if you haven't watched before, then start on season two. It's better animated, and the plots are a bit kookier, and the characters, especially Granddad, seem to liven up a bit. If Soul Plane 2: The Blackjacking had appeared in season one, I would say it was better. But really, the first episode of the second season shows you exactly what season one could have been.

2554857,5,B000F8O2RY,"The Boondocks is an animated cartoon that is based on the comic strip of the same name, created by Aaron McGruder.  The series is featured on cables Adult Swim late at night, but not sure exactly when, (I don't watch much TV, that's why I got the DVD) and is geared for more mature audiences.  I feel you really have to be older to get into this show; the subject matter and the way it's dealt with are very witty and sophisticated.  I watched one episode with my 13 year old son and he didn't understand about a lot of the jokes, he did laugh when young Huey was screaming, ""Ronald Reagan was the devil"".  That's funny no matter how old you are, but didn't know why many black people (and whites) would have that perspective; I guess they skip over those issues in school.

 If you're familiar with the comic strip, it's kinda has the same spirit, even though the strip seems more political than the series.  The Boondocks is social comedy that features race as a subject matter and more tackles the subject by looking at the cultures of the race and not just white vs. black..  Huey (the main character) and his little brother Riley are young black kids from the hood being raised in a rich suburban neighborhood by their once civil right activist grandfather.

Huey is well spoken, left leaning and highly educated about culture and politically charged topics.  He's a bit of Spike Lee, Mos Def and Malcolm X all in one.  I think this character is the closest to who the writer/creator McGruder is in the real world and shares many of the same points of view as young Huey does.  McGruder has a degree in African American studies and seems to voice as much criticism about his own race through the show, as he does on white people.  Huey's little thug bother Riley is your typical hood rat gangster wanna be that also has intelligence but rarely uses it.  Instead he looks at the world a bit differently than his older brother and chooses to embrace the gun toting, rolling on rims, booty shaken rap video, thug culture that is glamorized and sensationalized in the media far too offend  and revered by many youth of today.

 McGruder does an amazing job of showing the good, the bad, the ugly and the goofy things about being black in America.  He uses a diverse cast of characters to achieve all the different perspectives.  The rich, white old guy that not racist per say, but will exploit black people or anyone else to make a buck.  The rich mans son, that thinks he's black and wanna be thug (voiced by Charlie Murphy from the Chapel Show) and his best friend Gin Rummy (who also thinks he's gangsta, voiced by Samuel L. Jackson)  The educated, soft spoken, clean cut black lawyer with his white wife and mixed race daughter.  Granddad who gives the older black man perspective and his friend who is the darkest skinned black man in the show, who hates blacks and thinks the white man has helped the black man is every way possible, hates MLK and is pro slavery.

This show is just not about Black culture, this show has so many jokes about people in general you see everyday that are so funny and so true.  It was funny to me to watch episode 1 (the garden party) where it features a black man saying the N-word about 60 times to a bunch of tight lipped, stuffed shirt, rich white people and them not knowing if they should laugh or be offended, while I watched this with white people who didn't know if they should laugh or be offended.  It's pure gold.  The animation style has Japanese influence with an urban feel that makes the show stand out from other ""cartoons"".  The fight scenes between the various characters in the show are well done and great fun to watch.  This show also features some of the best voice actors that bring every character alive.  This show has tons of high profile guest voices that do lots of episodes.

This show takes a unique look at world today and what makes black and white culture so unique.  McGruder tackles black on black crime, rap wars, MLK, R. Kelly peeing on underage girls.  How blacks and whites deal with similar issues in a very different way.  Where is black Jesus?  How terrible BET is, and how it kills brain sells.  It attempts to raise social awareness of black culture and shows white America that black people have divorce opinions on what direction to move toward as a race.  This show, to me is about finding a middle ground of being proud of your race and culture without embracing every negative stereotype that exists.  People also have to come to an understanding what perpetuates those stereotypes in culture.  Just because you don't embrace it, many people do, that's why the stereotype exists.  There are thug black guys, there are white people that are scared of blacks, there is too much black on black crime and there is far too much patronizing guilt by white people as they offer no real solutions to better the social climate.

 Yes, white people move to the burbs to get away from black people and yes black people need more strong black leaders instead of just embracing athletes and entertainers you see on TV all the time.  Some of the issues can be hard to swallow but with the amount of humor used to convey these points, and many others, make it much easier to deal with.  Hopefully after your done laughing some of these subjects will stay with you long enough for you to have some real thoughts or maybe even dialog about these issues, with family or friends or god forbid, someone from another ethnic background....AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

One thing that Black people have on us white people is that they can talk about race and cultural differences much easier than white people can.  I mean, whites don't even talk about race relations with one another unless they know that the person they are talking to feels the same.  Why?  Well, white people are scared of having an opinion about other cultures.  Most white people are scared of sounding racist or having an opinion that could be conceived as so.  I think the world would be better off if the wrong things were said once in a while, so some real dialog could happen about some real social change that needs to happen in this country.

Yes there are many cultures and ethnic groups in the county but blacks and whites are like the Yankees and the Red Sox, we have so much history and so much we've done to point the finger at the other and done to keep each other down.  It's much better than what it was 50 years ago, but until we all get the elephant out of the room whites and blacks will always feel taken for granted by the other race. TV Shows like this one, South Park and the Chapple show do such a service to take tension always from this issue long enough and let all people look at there own people and laugh.  Not just laughing about their people, but with their people.

The show is proof, to the close minded conservative white man, that not only are black people socially aware of the plight and short comings in there community, there are many intelligent, free thinking men and women in that community that are willing to voice their opinions, and work to combat the problems in the black community.  There needs to be more of this of course, but it's a start.  It's a shame that the white race isn't quite there yet.",1198713600,3,7280,4.49923896499239

If you are looking for a comic strip show that airs the dirty laundry of every day issues that plague African American social, psychological and political society,this is the show for you. It explores with great humor and brilliance the racist attitudes that separate and bring together both black and white audiences and everybody in between. The Boondocks has become my idea of mature educational television at its best! I highly recommend this for anyone who is socially conscience but also for people who are not afraid to laugh at what America has created... Racism.",1190851200,,767,6.384615384615385

Huey is my hero and I love his take on the world and the people in it. No one is safe from his scrutiny, and he backs all of it up. And let's not forget Riley, who may be obcessed with the ""gangsta"" image, but also makes some very strong arguments himself (see the R.Kelly episode)about society and life. This DVD collections is def worth buying. I cant wait to read the comics because I was introduced to these characters through the tv show. Come on season 2!",1190332800,,586,4.060344827586207

Al ""who can I harass today"" Sharpton says the show makes very, very valid points about African American culture.

2554867,5,B000F8O2RY,"""The Boondocks"" cartoon series is based on the comic strip created by Aaron McGrude in 1999. Although many people have a different opinion as to what it is about, it's life seen through the eyes of African Americans and takes a look at their culture, racism, politics and everyday life.

After watching the series I knew it was in for a treat. I went back and looked at the comic strips and also enjoyed it. The comics started around 1997 then many years later here we have the cartoon series about the Freemans: Huey, Riley and Grandpa.

This series again is very much in your face, at times satirical, philosophical and always entertaining. It seems at times that Aaron does like exploit the use of ""N"" word in the series. However, ignoring this series is guaranteed to make you laugh.

The character of Uncle Ruckus (also on the strip) is a racist black man who hates his own race and praises white people. Tom Dubois is a successful black man (who is combo of an Uncle Tom mixed with W.E.B Dubois) often serving as the voice of reason yet at times being very conservative and conforming to the white man's world if you will.

My favorite episode of the bad are ""The Trial of R. Kelly"" , ""The Return of King"" (a what if episode looking at what would occur if Martin Luther King Jr. would still be alive), ""Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner"", and ""A Date with the health inspector"" (a great look at racial profiling) and ""Passion of the Ruckus"".

The DVD sets for the first season come loaded with special features which include: Audio and Video commentary for the first ten episodes, a making of feature, unaired promos for CN, an animatics looks at the series and deleted scenes.

The commentaries are decent. Sometimes the crew does get caught in watching the episode instead of commenting on them but they do provide enough information to give you an insight as to what it was like in making the series. For instance, Aaron mentions that the original opening was going to be a Star Wars like opening but for whatever reason it never happened.

All in all, a great set to own if you haven't seen the episodes then this is a must have.",1182470400,,2134,4.512953367875648
2554877,5,B000F8O2RY,This show is so addicting.  I couldn't wait for  the dvd set to come out.  It failed to dissapoint whenever it finally got here.  I can't wait for season two.,1182470400,,158,4.166666666666667
2554878,4,B000F8O2RY,"WOW!  The first season of The Boondocks TV show is absolutely excellent!  While I'm not overly fond of cursing and use of ""the n-word"", I must admit each episode is fabulous despite the language.  There is an actual moral to each episode, which can be used as a teaching tool for pre-teen children.  Of particular note is the episode ""A Date With The Health Inspector"" in which they have the single most awesome explanation of the steps leading to the war with Iraq that I've ever witnessed.  Many would watch this episode and never catch it, so here's a clue: the character ""Ed Wuncler, III"" is a young George W. Bush (voiced by Charlie Murphy) and his ""enforcer"" friend, ""Gin Rummy"" (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) represents Dick Cheney.  In the midst of an investigation of a real crime, they take a detour with the obvious intention of robbing a store (the owner's name is Aladin Husein).  They accuse Husein of having a weapon ostensibly to justify what they are about to do.  No matter how much Husein says he has no weapons, George ... er, ahem, I mean Ed, III and Rummy insist he does; so much so that even the security guard - who CLEARLY sees Husein has nothing - becomes convinced Husein must have a weapon!  Funniest to me was Husein uttering, ""Ed, you know me, your father helped me build this store!  There are no weapons here.  Perhaps you mean the Korean store north of here.""  If that ain't a blatant slap of truth, I don't know what is! lol.  At the conclusion of this ""war"" Ed and Rummy are met by camera crews and America-loving spectators who know that they've just committed a crime, but since Husein is ""of terrorist decent"" they celebrate them.  The purchase price is well worth it just for this episode alone, but there are 14 others on this 3 disc set, that you will watch over and over again.

NOTE: please do NOT allow young children to watch this alone.  Watch with them and explain the intent, both morally and politically, behind each episode.",1181260800,2,1973,4.531073446327683

When the Cartoon Network announced they were putting  on an animated version of Aaron McGruder's comic strip,  i was causious. I expected a (dare i say it)a WHITE washed version of the strip, like a Peanut special. I was surprised with the animation and direction of the first episode (Garden Party) and the surprise lasted to the other 14 episodes. I was hooked

Whereas the Simpsons, King of the Hill, South Park and Family Guy broke ground in TV animation. The DOCKS stole from all, put its own spin on it and made it a winner in comedy and social commentary. It satired the real world and its people in general. This is mean biting satire that don't let up so easier... A thinking man urban universe

2554943,5,B000F8O2RY,"Huey Freeman is angry.  And can you blame him?  As a ten-year-old aspiring black revolutionary living in the almost entirely white suburb of Woodcrest with his stern, authoritarian grandfather and his thug-worshipping younger brother Riley after relocating from Chicago's tough South Side, Huey is faced with the grim realities of both white condescension and black ignorance as he tries to call to light the truths people would rather not face.  In the opening scene of The Boondocks, Aaron McGruder's confrontational, profane, and brilliantly satirical adaptation of his comic strip, Huey envisions himself inciting a riot at an all-white garden party by reporting some unpleasant truths (at least in his mind) about Jesus, Ronald Reagan, and 9/11, but when he actually gets a chance to do so he merely finds himself praised for being ""articulate.""  And when he tries to bring his vision of a black Jesus to the masses via his school Christmas play (with some help from Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Quincy Jones), his work becomes the target of a boycott by parents angry at the exclusion of their children.  Not to mention, he has to watch a race-baiting white laywer exploit black-white divisions to get R. Kelly off on underage peeing charges, and witness two wanna-be master criminals exploiting wartime paranoia to rob a store when he just wants to get his friend out of jail.  All in all, Huey faces un uphill climb in his quest to shake a comfortable populace out of its complacency.

Huey's attempts at fomenting revolution, however, are just the tip of the iceberg in The Boondocks, which presents viewers with a mix of the political, social, philosophical and sentimental that I have yet to see in animated TV.  It comes along at just the right time, too, as many cartoon giants have come to feel increasingly calcified: South Park, while still a frequently brilliant show, has become increasingly reliant on excessive toilet humor and often contrived topicality; The Simpsons ran out of ideas about eight years ago; and the ""revived"" Family Guy has become a lazy, unfunny mockery of its former self, weighed down by interminable, punch line-less ""jokes"" and rapid-fire successions of random, context-free pop culture references.  Viewed in this context, the Boondocks feels refreshingly raw, witty, and character-driven in its approach; and more importantly, it's frequently, gut-busting hilarious regardless of whether you're always in agreement with its subversive viewpoint or whether you approve of its near-constant use of the N-word among other choice terms.  There are some overtly topical episodes-taking incisive aim at such subjects at hip-hop culture (The Story of Gangstalicious); the legacy of the civil rights movement and the post-9/11 closing of the American Mind (The Return of the King); and traditional attitudes regarding Christmas (A Huey Freeman Christmas)-but they never diminish the episodes as vehicles for telling stories or exploring characters.  Some of the best episodes are actually more personal and familial than political-in Riley Wuz Here, Huey's ignorant younger brother explores his artistic side with the help of a kindly but insane gun-toting art-teacher, while Wingmen sees both Huey and Granddad confronting figures from their pasts in a return to their old neighborhood for the funeral of Granddad's friend.  And throughout, there's the show's examination of the generation gap and the dynamics of a decidedly atypical family, as we frequently see the size of the gulf between Huey, Riley, and their old-school, tough-loving grandfather.

The voice acting is top-to-bottom terrific, starting with Regina King, who deserves special props for taking on double duty by performing the roles of both Huey and Riley (most impressively, I heard that she read all her Huey lines and all her Riley lines separately, no small task considering how different the voices are and how frequently she has to act against herself).  In the other principal role, John Witherspoon is suitably grizzled and cantankerous as Granddad, while Gary Anthony Williams (aka Stevie's father from Malcolm in the Middle) is hilariously over the top as Uncle Ruckus, an elderly Uncle Tom with a freakishly large right eye who in one episode actually turns his hatred of his own people into a religion.  An array of one-off and recurring guest stars including Adam West (R. Kelly's slimy lawyer), Ed Asner (rapacious capitalist Ed Wuncler), Charlie Murphy (inept criminal and George W. Bush mockup Ed Wuncler III) and Samuel L. Jackson (Ed III's partner in crime and Donald Rumsfeld caricature Gin Rummy) helps expand the show's stable of memorable characters even more, bringing it close to prime-era Simpsons in terms of creating a far-reaching and (somewhat) lifelike make-believe world.

Where the Boondocks really outshines much of its competition, though, is its appearance.  Simply put, this show looks incredible: rich, colorful, and expressive it a way most animation scarcely approaches.  Owing a heavy debt to Japanese anime, especially in its occasional, but brilliantly shot, fight scenes, The Boondocks far surpasses the likes of Family Guy and South Park in its attention to detail, be it the astonishingly lifelike background scenery or the intimate (if not always pleasant) details of its characters' appearances.  Hell, Huey's afro and Uncle Ruckus's oversized eye alone are practically worth the price of the DVD set.

Along with the 15 episodes on these discs, the season one DVD set is laden with the kind of time-wasting extras hardcore fans crave: several insightful commentaries (plus two not-so-insightful ones with Uncle Ruckus, which are just plain funny), animatics, three deleted scenes (all of them hilarious), and a 20-minute featurette, heavy on McGruder's commentary, regarding the process of bringing his vision to the screen.  In all, this season set is more than worth the price for those in the mood for a departure from the animated-TV norm.",1158969600,27,6009,5.277777777777778
2554944,5,B000F8O2RY,"Yes, Yes, and Yes I have waited for this DVD and I think everyone should be just as happy as me. The Boondocks is everything it looks to be and more. It goes with its comedy and Aaron Mcgruder goes even further with his take on today's government and today's society. If you don't already know the comic strip the Boondocks is about a nice grandfather (John Witherspoon) stepping up to take care of his grandkids so he moves them from the city to the suburbs. As soon as you start watching the series you'll notice he's not really a nice grandfather. He's got a short temper, a dirty mouth, and hates it when somebody drinks all his orange juice.

Now Huey and Riley are two very interesting kids, Riley is a big follower but a leader at the same time. He chooses to go the opposite way in life than Huey but at the same time he follows the stereotypes while Huey is trying to destroy that cycle. The amazing characters definitely make this series what it is especially Ruckus who is given a name that fits his demeanor. I have never met a person so racist towards their own people the way Ruckus is and though that might sound crazy to some he is actually hilarious. He really reminds you of Clayton Bigsby from Chappelle's show.

Thank goodness Adult Swim picked up this series because anywhere else it would have been canceled by now. Aaron uses an outstanding set of characters to put across messages and he assigns that power to Huey Freeman. Sometimes no matter how serious Huey tries to be you can't help but laugh at the things he does. He's a strong little man with a much different style than most 10 year olds you know. If you think the scene from the preview at the Garden Party when Huey gets on stage and makes an unforgettable announcement was funny wait till you see what else he's got for you.

A great thing about this series is that it stays true to the comic strip and Mcgruder is allowed to go crazier than he does in the strip.  If you ask me this show is exactly what we need, not only to give a few laughs but also to show what is being ignored. I think Mcgruder is absolutely right about R Kelly and somebody needed to say it again. Mcgruder's sketch on Martin Luther King and how he feels about what's going on with the youth is interesting and is probably accurate. Guest appearances kill and give the series that extra something especially Mike Epps when he plays Granddads old buddy that he absolutely hates. The series is unique and hilarious and no lie the more you see it the more you love it and I can't wait for season 2.",1158364800,,2555,4.350104821802935

2554948,5,B000F8O2RY,"In a word: hilarious.  In more words: surprising, fresh, raw, and of course - offensive.  The Boondocks is all these things because it is a true ""insider's"" show.  Many of the things said, debated, and brought to light are talked about with the same vigor, energy, and controversial language behind closed doors.  I wouldn't call it dirty laundry exactly, but it's real, genuine black comedy.  It's akin to Martin Lawrence's show (via animation of course) in that certain phrases and expressions that (many, but not all) blacks share amongst themselves are now being broadcast to a much wider net of people.  Some people will ""get it"" and many won't.  And of course, some people laugh with the show and its characters and others laugh at the show and its characters, but that's the risk you run when you're on a major network (cable or otherwise).  It's especially appealing to black people who grew up in predminantly black neighborhoods or households, then went outside (for work or college) and have a dual perspective.  This show is a window into a segmented, cultural mindset and you may not like what you see or disagree with its validity, but you'll definitely get an eyeful. The DVD extras include a revealing interview with Boondocks' creator which gives some valuable insight.  Bottom line: Do you have to be black to enjoy this show?  No, but it certainly helps in some of the edgier scenes.  The Boondocks doesn't shy from race and attacks internal and external issues of the black community with a vengeance.  It's outside the box - that's why it's so great.",1156982400,5,1571,4.817164179104478

I wish there could have been more deleted scenes. Only the first disc contains deleted scenes and all of the bells and whistles of the whole dvd set. Still I was thoroughly entertained.

2554963,5,B000F8O2RY,"Boondocks is as relevant as South Park. I only say south Park because it tends to deal with issues of relevance through satire, extreme yes, but satire nonetheless. If one were to really examine it, a lot of African Americans are either a Riley, a Huey, a Grandad, an Uncle Ruckus, a Tom, etc. Each of the characters on THe Bonnodcks represents some level of the African American psyche. The genius of the show, is even it's criticism of certain stereotypes and complexes, at the end, it's still about unity, about loving each other despite our flaws. Each of these personalities co-exist amongst each other, despite their differences. Uncle Ruckus and Huey are on two compltetely different sides of the spectrum, yet they can sit and eat together, and disagree.

  Now yes, I would say that the show is hard on white people, but Ed Wuncler (""Mr. I Own Everything"") does exist, and his heartlessness yet desire to identify with the Grandad is true, a lot of top white executives, politicians,  white men of powerful means, love the blues, the struggle of the black man, yet are directly responsible for many of the conditions that oppress African Americans. But at the end of the day, they feel their pain, they just don't care. The episode where Ed Wuncler teaches Jazmine the meaning of ""hard work"" by exploiting her lemonade stand and her dream of owning a pony is real. We're all chasing that pony, and some of us will never get it, and the person who sees that desire exploits us for it. And yes. Ed Wuncler III is what the children of rich white people have become/are now. They love ""nigga"" culture, as there fathers loved the blues, but the difference is that they may one move on to inherit their father's wealth, while the people they emulate may eventually float away in a natural disaster to be abandoned, or however that goes.

 So you should by this DVD collection and watch it, and laugh, and think, and realize that some of the best humor is derived from pain and anger. Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Martin Lawrence in his heyday, George Carlin, the list goes on and on. But also note that if the show offends you, I mean outright offends you, one, its just a cartoon, and two, maybe it offends you because in some way it is true, maybe it insults you, maybe one of the characters hits too close to home, and in that case, maybe the problem is not the cartoon.",1156550400,7,2375,4.563380281690141
2554964,5,B000F8O2RY,"Being a fan of the comics, I was curious and excited when it was announced that there would be an animated version of the Boondocks. I was very disappointed after watching the first episode. It was not funny, boring, and seemed to lack some of the spirit of the comics. I had a hard time watching the series regularly. Besides the pilot I probably only saw two other complete episodes and bits and pieces of the others. Thankfully, one of the ones I saw was the Trial of R. Kelly episode which is my favorite episode. Based upon how good that episode was, I took a chance and bought the DVDs. I am so glad I did. This is now my favorite Adult Swim series. There are so many laugh out loud episodes, great animation throughout the series, good music, and a real message. The Return of the King should be shown uncensored during network primetime on MLK day in my humble opinion. I know that episode generated some controversy, but the only people it would offend are the people it who should have the most to learn from its message. Overall, this is highly recommeneded, although as much as I love it I still think the first episode was a huge disappointment, but hey my favorite episode is the second one so that shows how fast they hit their stride. I didn't like the Venture Brothers until about halfway through the season. Buy this and show it to your friends!",1156550400,2,1363,4.434262948207171

2554966,5,B000F8O2RY,"There are those that may complain that the Boondocks series loses its audience in the political wheel it constantly spins, but that is because those people do not understand the show.  The characters are completely irreverent, but completely lovable.  Huey and Riley represent the two extremes of the black man in America and their inevitable conflicts make for some of the most hilarious comedy television has to offer.  And unlike a lot of other shows, The Boondocks really does have a vision.  Writer Aaron McGruder wanted to get people to think while also getting them laughing.  He pokes fun of everyone from ""gangsta"" rappers to upperclass white America.  The man is nothing if not thorough and no one is spared...not even BET, the so called channel for Black Americans.

As a show it fails to entertain but as a satirical comic strip it certainly does the deed. I feel that show should ""humanize"" the characters more instead of constantly boxing them in with ""racial topics"" and limiting their potential to develop as characters.

I watched this show with the best and most optimistic mindset but it really dissapointed me. It tried to inject intelligent arguments with humour a'la ""South Park"" but got lost in its own propaganda....like Spike Lee's latest films. The comic strip did a much better job at finding humour in stereotypes...I wonder why this 30 minute series didn't?

2554968,4,B000F8O2RY,"Aaron McGruder's comic strip comes to life with the first season of the Boondocks; a show which almost single handedly breathed new life and added a much needed new voice to the Adult Swim lineup.  Regina King provides the voices for both Huey and Riley Freeman; two young brothers living with their Grandfather in suburbia.  Throughout these 15 episodes, McGruder and co. take aim at social and racial issues; and for a majority of the time, they hit the nail on the head.  The first episode, entitled ""Garden Party"", introduces us to everyone, including the maniacal Uncle Ruckus who will have you on the floor laughing.  R. Kelly isn't spared in ""The Trial of R. Kelly"", and the surprisingly poignant ""Return of the King"" (which received much criticism from Al Sharpton) remains the high point of the series so far.  Charlie Murphy and even Samuel L. Jackson have recurring roles as two white gangsta wanna-be's who provide some even funnier moments than Uncle Ruckus, but it's the show's politically charged riffs that seperate the Boondocks from the rest of the Adult Swim lineup.  The DVD set features some great extras, including commentaries by McGruder and ""Uncle Ruckus"", which is worth the price of admission alone.",1155427200,,1226,4.95609756097561
2554969,5,B000F8O2RY,"The most difficult thing to determine when watching The Boondocks is your favorite character.  For me it changes.  When the belt comes out, I like Robert ""Bitches"" Freeman.  Before I ever watched the show and I only knew The Boondocks as the most innovative political satire ever and the most refreshing comic strip since Bloom County, I cheered the militant Huey.  Riley, Thomas, Jasmine, etc. all add to the comic and the show in their own way.

BUT . . . no character has ever been created in any venue that compares to Uncle Ruckus (no relation)!  The self-hating, backward thinking, fountain of all knowledge (when he gets his puny brain working on it) is irony incarnate--or rather in-animate.  His commentary for Grandad's Fight was the funniest thing I've heard in a long time.  He call's out Muhammad Ali 10 times!  And he defines his two favorite words in the English language.  I laughed literally until tears squirted.  This alone was worth the $30.

If you've seen them all and you wonder why you would buy the set once you've seen them once, well here's your reason;

2554980,5,B000F8O2RY,"If you get this title-you've seen the DVD and KNOW what I'm talking about!

Aaron McGruder's THE BOONDOX has provoked a lot of thought and controversy in the newspaper cartoons-and the animated version is (amazingly) even better!

Huey and Riley & co. tackle some really important issues in Black America with raw, biting social commentary and humor. As was the case with Richard Pryor, I didn't like the repetitive use of the N-word and soem scenes get really graphic (such as the portrayal of the urination scene of the infamous R. Kelly video).

But I wouldn't throw out the baby with the bath on this one. In THE TRIAL OF R.KELLY, Huey and Riley take on the manner in which some Black celebrites (and their lawyers) brainwash the masses into thinking their crimes are really racist persecution rather than their own personal stupidity. Having seen this sickening scenario with Mike Tyson and Marion Barry in the 90s, I wanted to stand up and cheer when Huey told the court R. KELLY AIN'T NO NELSON MANDELA-LET'S HAVE SOME G-----N STANDARDS!"" Three cheers and a pumped fist from me Aaron!

The same is true when MLK comes back from a coma and curses out some fools acting like a BET video come to life. ""DID I GET KILLED FOR THIS!?"" Bill Cosby would love it (I know I do)!

Black self-hatred is viciously lampooned with the Uncle Ruckus character, who longs for the return of slavery and worships Ronald Reagan and all things white. When the cops shoot him in one episode, he says, ""I can't blame y'all for doing your job.""

Ed Asner plays a corrupt (and racist) businessman who cheats little Jazmine out of her lemonade business (among other things). Any Black person who has had to endure patronizing conversation from White liberals will identify with THE GARDEN PARTY.

I would advise skipping the commentary. The creators laugh so much and tell so manyinside jokes that we get very little insight at all. But that can easily be skipped. The DELETED SCENES (especially the Rosa Parks-fried chicken gag) would give Al Sharpton a fit and I can see why that was never aired.

The humor and satire is rough and raw. It takes a lot of familiarity with African-American culture and pop culture in general to ""get"" a lot of this (such as the biz about a Black Panther named ""Shabazz K. Milton Berle"" that I mention in my title). I would not let the kiddies near this one. But even when I disagree with Aaron McGruder, I think that he is using this medium to say a lot of important things that need to be said.",1154649600,12,2509,4.597315436241611
2554981,5,B000F8O2RY,"This cartoon has it all. It's hilarious yet you can see the truth behind all the humor. It makes you laugh and makes you think. I love it when Huey and Riley can bring forth excellent points (and often they share the same point) yet they have different views of how to attack the issue. Examples of this are in episodes like ""The Trial of R. Kelly"", ""Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner"", and ""Granddad's Fight"". One of my favorites was the R. Kelly episode. Riley: ""Oh yes, the victim! At what point does personal responsiblity become a part of this equation? I see piss coming, I move. She saw piss coming, she stayed!""

Huey: ""You all love R. Kelly? You want to help R. Kelly? Then get some counseling for R. Kelly! Introduce him to some older women! Hide his video camera! But do not act like this guy is a hero!""",1154563200,2,810,4.328947368421052

But, as I was watching this particular episode with a friend, I noticed that everything I thought was hilarious was extremely offensive to her...especially since she was in the process of eating a nice fat-filled meal. Anyway, I found myself caught off-guard by some of the comments the characters made and by some of the scenarios--that controversial, suprising element is what I loved best about it. Plus, I think Huey is sexy for an animated character. If you love a good laugh, have a broad sense of humor, enjoy controversial topics, and if you're African-American, especially (as alot of the topics encourage us to analyze some of our culture), I think you would definitely benefit from watching this DVD collection.

2554987,2,B000F8O2RY,"The writing is good and the plot is funny, but I have one major problem:

The little brother looks like a GIRL. His facial structure, his hair and the way he speaks. I watched several episodes before someone told me that kid was a BOY. Every time I look at that kid I just think girl, girl, girl. The drawing of that kid is a MAJOR mistake.

When a major character looks like the wrong gender, that's a huge flaw.

I'm not just talking about the long hair. Everything about this kid says girl.",1154476800,,493,4.223404255319149
2554988,5,B000F8O2RY,"i watched one episode and i was hooked. this show is completely offensive to those who don't realize that one of the points of it. it borders the type of comedy David Chappelle and Carlos Mencia have brought into public eye along with its own mix of storylines that just make this show more then a sketch show or anyone of the other anime cartoons out there.

if you have seen any episode so far, you should know that the entire series is truely a masterpiece. almost all the episodes were great. i ain't gonna point out my favorites because you should check out the entire collection and i will be waiting for the next series to come out if they decide to keep it going.

oh yeah, i just love some of the voice acting such as the dad from the movie Friday plays as the grandpa, and Samuel L Jackson plays as a white guy and he even recited a line from Pulp Fiction. that had me laughing my @$$ off when i realized where it was coming from.",1154390400,6,940,4.1878453038674035

Horrible animation.

Cliche characters that earn their bread by making fun of other cliche characters for being cliches.

Voice acting that makes you wanna' drag your fingers down a chalkboard until your nails break off.

And you're not going to like this one bit, I know...but it's a racist show.  Plain and simple.

So what, somebody made ""Amos & Andy"" like fifty years ago?

Sorry.

Does that license a double-standard?

I wish it didn't.

But don't take my word for it.  It's on Cartoon Network nearly every night, and probably will be until the sales report of this monstrous DVD set comes in.",1154044800,7,704,4.544

I have people concerned about kids watching this, however, with so much on that have all of the insults with no explanation, and this is much welcomed. I discuss the deeper meanings of the show with my son so he can understand some of the things that are going on. Example, the episode with Gangstalisous, was brilliant in showing how it is in the entertainment business for some (if not most) of the rap stars. I have seen Mr. McGruder in interviews and he handles his business and stands up to the criticism.

I cant stand reading the funny papers if I even see The Boondocks in them, the name alone sounds like it took no thought, my kids could have thought of a better title. ""The Unfunny Afro Kids, Where There Is No Punchline At The End of The Strip"". The creator has no clue of politics and is sitting in his mansion pretending to be a pissed off minority.

I'm totally hooked, have been for a while. I used to read the comic strip as well. My Son was the one who told me about it the show, at first I was like this to much for kids (small kids). I watched ""The Health Inspector"" I couldn't stop laughing. I eventually dl them all off the internet. I watch at least one everyday, even have 4 episodes on my MP3 player. I constantly surprised at how many people don't know who they are, or haven't watched the show. Go figure. My favorite's are ""The Health Inspector, Gangstaliscious, The Real, A Huey Freeman Xmas.""

Another thing that is so cool is the guest stars who lend there talent to make the show so Unique. Theres Samuel L. Jackson, Charley Murphy, Mike Epps, Quincy Jones, Kim Whitley, Mos Def, Terry Crews, Kat Williams, Xzibit,DJ Pooh....We definately have to thank Regina King, for the voices of Riley and Huey, and John Witherspoon for Grandad. I so anxious to get the DVD and see the uncut versions. Also for FYI the official merchandise is now at Hot Topics! I have 3 of the T-Shirts already.

The show pokes fun and these ""so called gangsta rappers"", racism, how black people interact with each other, and how unjust the government is. To summarize it all, this show is absolute genious. If the creators can keep it real/funny like it has been this show will be around just as long as the simpsons!.",1150243200,7,404,4.625
2555006,5,B000F8O2RY,I really love this show. It's just genius. Huey's deep/ revolutionary personality coounters Riley's gangsta persona perfectly. The only reason for people not liking the show is the language (of which we hear way worse at school) and the stereotypes (hey Family Guy has stereotypes too so stop hatin!). I own all of the comic books which are funny as heck (just read A Right to be Hostile). I wouldn't mind seeing Cindy in the series and I hear Caesar's comin next season (MC!). I'm buying this on DVD and UMD so I can watch it at home and on the road even though I have all the episodes on my computer already. The hidden messages in the show are crazy. Just watch an episode. This show is too deep. I hope it doesn't get cancelled like most black cartoons. I miss Waynehead!,1149984000,10,775,4.426573426573427

I can watch it and appreciate Aaron Mcgruder for his views on Black culture and laugh at the jokes and see the truth in his work, while others think it is degrading or disrespectful to black people. I had a person ask me  what i was watching and told him, andhe watched the show and looked at me like i was  crazy...very narrow mined if you ask me.

I am also an avid fan of Southpark and carlos mencia if that helps you make up your mind one way or another. The comedy can be a little dark and off beat sometimes but then again thats the stuff i like best. This show has thsome of the greatest and most unforgettable characters i've ever seen. All things considered i highly recommend this show and plan to buy the season on DVD soon. Hopefully it will be full of extra's and who Knows maybe they'll give Uncle Ruckus his own show.,1147824000,,653,4.360655737704918
2555009,5,B000F8O2RY,"I was first introduced to ""The Boondocks"" from the comic strip. Never in my wildest dreams had I imagined the show would be this funny. It is hilarious! While I wouldn't recommend viewing by children, I suggest this show just about everywhere I go because it is GENIUS. It's clearly not meant to be offensive but is actually very true to real life. Black people do use the N word, a lot. And of course there are some black people who hate other black people or feel they have status if they can date/marry someone of the caucasian persuasion. It's a way to look at things from a serious point but be able to laugh at the rediculousness(is that a word?) of it all. I dare just about anyone to watch this show and not laugh til tears run.

2555011,5,B000F8O2RY,"This show is too much for FOX to handle cause it's TV/MA. Once you buy the DVD it will be uncut & uncensored. This is my favorite comedy show on [adult swim] right next to Robot Chicken.

It's so overrated, I was really shocked when one episode had R. Kelly peeing on a teenage girl I thought for sure their would be some conversity. Huey and Riley should of stayed in the big city instead of moving into the surburbs with their granddad cause it's boring. This is the best mature cartoon show since ""Spawn"" which use-to be on HBO.",1146441600,3,531,4.31

I thought it was going to be 100% faithful to the comic strip but it prooved to have a force all its own. The comic strip is the PG version of Aaron McGruder's satire while the cartoon is the hard R. And I must say that the artistry and animation is really first rate. With good aesthetic value and quality production values, it is a work of art compared to all the other Adult Swim programs.

Riley the wannabe gangsta (hilarious!) and old school Grandpa balance well with Huey's revoluntary stance. Episodes like 'Gangstalicious' and 'Return of the King' are flinchingly accurate portrayals of the state of black affairs today. Big ups to my boy Aaron!

2555014,5,B000F8O2RY,"This show BLEW me away when it came on earlier this year. I'd heard of, but not read, the comic strip...but I had no idea really how incindiary, topical, scathing, and brilliant this show was going to be. I thought ""oh gee...another attempt to bring a little comic strip to TV."" I should have detected brilliance when the show was knocked from BET to Adult Swim (Catoon Network...the only channel with BALLS big enough to air something like this).

Like the dearly departed ""Chappelle Show,"" Boondocks is about racism and the culture wars in modern America. It attacks stereotypes (of both whites and blacks)...but evern better, the show also attacks reality. The best example of this would be the infamous ""Dr. King"" episode, in which in an alternate timeline, we see what would happen if the famous civil rights champion had not died but merely been placed into a coma.  When King wakes up and speaks out against the War in the Middle East he's labeled a ""traitor.""  Brilliant. Some people may miss the irony, and humor, of the show. If you take it at face value, the show is the most racist thing on TV today. However, if you examine the context, and the intent of the creators you'll find that this show speaks volumes on the problems of today's world. The people who work on this show obviously are supremely talented, and have a lot of important things to say.
