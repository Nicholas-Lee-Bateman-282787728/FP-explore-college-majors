8444551,5,B004W6JJTQ,"Now im a big fan of collecting cases. if there is anything I like more than a good movie its the cases they come in, but when I saw this triple feature I could not pass on the movie bundle savings. what I really enjoyed about the dvd's was that they came with art on them instead of the generic silver type dvds with only the titles and proof of legalness (you know proof that they weren't bootleg). the movies are also a must have for any dc collector, and seeing as they fit 3 in one case it means more room for the new dc movies coming out!",1411084800,,543,3.9908256880733943
