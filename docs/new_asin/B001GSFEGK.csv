3619594,5,B001GSFEGK,"I am so disappointed that ""Bastards of the Party"" is not available. This movie/documentary was shown in a course I took entitled ""Introduction to Gang Culture"" - it is a fasinating trip through the history and inception of the Crips and Bloods, it follows the evolution of the current gangs in our communities today. Afterall, if we do not study the history, we cannot truly understand and deal with issues we face today.  I hope Amazon.com will find a distibutor for this phenomenal documentary.",1296777600,6,496,4.904761904761905
3619595,5,B001GSFEGK,"I couldn't take my eyes off the screen - even though it was only aired after 1 a.m., it was just absolutely riveting and put together so well. I knew then that I would have to get a copy to show to the young people in my family as soon as it became available. This is definitely a life-changing piece. If the information ever gets out, it will rock an entire generation. Loved it!!",1240876800,5,381,4.162162162162162
3619596,5,B001GSFEGK,I saw this doc on HBO in 2007 and it's handsdown the most comprehensive and interesting gang doc I've ever seen. It's classroom ready for any professors or really good high school teacher out there as well. I have a masters in African American Studies and loved Gang Bangin' in Little Rock as a tween and the majority of this well produced doc (I also have a BA in TV Production) was news to me. This doc gives great historical context for gang culture in the US but especially Los Angeles and is as informational as it is entertaining. 3 thumbs up!,1233273600,15,549,4.392156862745098
3619597,5,B001GSFEGK,"I've seen this on HBO documentaries in 2007 and it took my breath away! After watching it, I had to start it over and watch it again.",1224720000,14,133,3.962962962962963
8306857,5,B001GSFEGK,This needs to be found somewhere for purchase,1448841600,,45,4.75
8306858,5,B001GSFEGK,"Amazon needs to restock this item; it's like the oppressive forces that be don't want the Truth to be told; this doc is amazing, you can YouTube sections of the movie but I have been wanting to use the dvd to enlighten these young minds in the street about the Truth! Bring this movie back!",1446681600,,290,4.290909090909091
8306859,5,B001GSFEGK,"I, too remember when this was first aired on HBO. Sadly it appears as if HBO will not air it EVER again. I've given up hope there....

I've read several books and watched numerous films/documentaries regarding gang culture and violence and hands down this is by far the best one I've encountered. B.O.T.P. is very detailed, informative, and insightful as to the development of the Los Angeles gangs (emphasis on Bloods and various factions) and full of a rich historical context that sets the stage for the emergence of gangs. Without spoiling it, the overall end message and suggestions was really deep and thought provoking, something that I feel could be applied outside of gang culture.

The good news...not too long ago this was available for streaming on Netflix (about 6 months-1 year ago). The bad news...is it seems to no longer be available. BUT I have some hopes that maybe this will resurface on Netflix at the very least or I will continue to check Amazon. I made a mistake recommending this to my college professor at the time as I taped it on HBO and let him borrow it and never saw it again :(

If anyone ever comes across this rare gem I strongly encourage to view this film or hang on to it.",1436227200,5,1209,4.56221198156682
8306860,5,B001GSFEGK,"This movie is the Truth! I figure that's why Amazon doesn't ever have this movie in stick-because the powers that be don't want this type of Truth out there. I've used this doc to help change the minds of several youngsters needing a clue, and I've been waiting to see this movie available so I can buy as many copies as financially possible to change as many minds as humanly possible.",1421884800,3,386,4.450704225352113
8306861,5,B001GSFEGK,The best documentary I have seen on L.A. gang history and culture.,1416441600,,66,4.583333333333333
8306862,5,B001GSFEGK,"This is a great documentary film, and the best one ever about the history of the Bloods and the Crips and how they grew out of the ashes of the Black Panthers. It goes back to the Great Migration and the early days of LA before it was known as a gangland but still had a Klansman like police force. It does into the Spook Hunters who were the cause of the Black and Latinos gangs you see today. Slausons, The Avenues, The Brims, The Kelley's, The Bishops, Baby Avenues, the Pirus, the Rodney King Riots of 1992, etc. Today these gangs grew to 100,000's of members across California and the nation. I like how Bone discusses with some of the gang members of the prevention of unification of the gangs back into that Afrocentric mindset via the police, the feds, and other intelligences by provoking beef and violence amongst the gangs and community in general. This is probably why HBO has not yet released this film yet on DVD to stop it from getting to the mass media with such easy access. Luckily, I seen this movie few years ago on YouTube back in 2007. This is a great piece of knowledge on the Bloods and Crips and the Black Community of LA.",1384041600,,1147,4.364485981308412
8306863,5,B001GSFEGK,"This outstanding documentary on the destruction of the Black Panther Party by the FBI and the government and how the Crips and Bloods evolved is yet one more example of an important piece of Black history in DVD form that gets marginalized, hidden away and basically made unavailable, in the same way as the great documentary on Malcolm X: Make It Plain. I agree with what all other 5 star reviewers are saying, and maybe if we all wrote to HBO and asked them to reprint it, they would.  I got a grainy copy of it online from a seller (just look for it and you'll find it), but I really wish I had a crisp and clear copy to show my students.",1380844800,3,641,4.211382113821138
8306864,5,B001GSFEGK,"This is one of the finest documentaries I have ever seen.  It takes a complex and difficult topic, and tells a shocking, eviscerating and hugely compelling story.  I cannot reccomend it enough.  If you are interested in this subject, you want to watch this film.",1334966400,2,262,4.777777777777778
8306865,5,B001GSFEGK,"This is a great illustration of, ""Ye reap what ye sow"".

This is not a movie I particularly want to see again.  I was convinced.  What I want is a stack of these DVDs to give away to others.

OK, I take that back.  I do want to see it again.",1321401600,2,241,3.6470588235294117
8306866,5,B001GSFEGK,"This film is amazing...details a little known history between the FBI-initiated destruction of Black Liberation movements of 60s/70s with the illegal cointel pro program, and the role of economic and political policies under the neoliberal/conservative backlash in leading to the rise of the Bloods and Crips. Does an excellent job investigating the origins of gang life and the current realities of communities besieged by it in a way that dispels with racist mainstream myths that gang violence is a product of deviant/savage/inherently criminal Black and Brown youth. Tragic and enraging but an invaluable accomplishment in resisting the elision of experiences of marginalized communities of color and the silencing of the damning history out of which ""gang culture"" emerged. Just how damning that history is may help to explain why the title isn't available on Amazon...",1298505600,6,874,5.481481481481482
