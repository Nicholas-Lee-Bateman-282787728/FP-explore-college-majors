2632743,5,B000HC2LRQ,"Invader Zim is very worth watching.  Zim is an alien (Irken) who is intent upon conquering the Earth, which he believes he's been assigned to do by his home planet. Actually, the people in charge of the alien planet just sent him to Earth, which is to them a piddly nowhere little planet, to get him out of the way because he is such a screw-up.

Zim is completely unaware of the fact that everyone regards him as a screw-up, and is very fanatical about his quest to conquer Earth.

Zim has a goofy sidekick robot named Gir who was taken out of the garbage and given to him when they sent him on his ""quest"" to conquer Earth.  Gir is a hilarious character, and is part of what makes theseries so great (he reminds me very much of my cat, I think I would've named her Gir if I had seen any episodes of Zim before I got her).

There is one person in the whole universe besides Zim who actually takes his quest to conquer Earth seriously, and that is his nemesis, Dib.  Dib is a human boy who is obsessed with aliens, and he is the only person who realizes Zim is an alien.  Dib tries to tell everyone that Zim is an alien but no one believes him, so he singlehandedly tries to thwart all of Zim's plots.  It always backfires on him, and Zim's plots always fail anyway.

The artist who wrote and drew the series is Jhonen Vasquez, who was known before Invader Zim, for the ""Johnny the Homicidal Maniac"" (JTHM) and ""Squee"" comic book series.  Invader Zim is more than just a comedy, the artwork is great and every episode is full of Vasquez's characteristic dark, subtle mockery of all the stupid things about society.

I think Invader Zim was excellently done and deserved a longer life than the less-than-a-year it was given on Nickelodeon.  I believe this was because it was being shown in the wrong venue.  I just don't think that the people who turned on Nickelodeon on a Friday night were expecting or looking for anything like Vasquez's dark, intelligent humor.  I think that most people who glanced at it just assumed it was more of the same-old meaningless Nick-toons, and never really ever tried to watch it(not that I mind Nick-toons, but not even ""Rocket Power"" or ""SpongeBob Squarepants"" come close). I myself might never have sat down to watch Invader Zim, except that, being familiar with JTHM and Squee, I recognized Vasquez's artwork when I happened to catch a commercial for the show.",1166659200,13,2398,4.482758620689655

Apart from the box (which simply holds the four DVD cases housing the six discs one can get separately) there is no such added value.

No commentaries, no interviews, no behind-the-scenes, no gag reel, no still gallery.

Just the shows.

2632815,3,B000HC2LRQ,"-This set contains the COMPLETE SERIES of all the completed episodes. As of now, this seems to be the most AFFORDABLE way to get the complete series.

-Contains NO SPECIAL FEATURES or commentary. Mountains of special features for *Zim* are known to exist, so I'm not sure why they aren't reproduced here; I assume there were cost or rights issues. If you desire to see the special features, you need to hunt down older (hideously expensive) releases. Specifically, this set is NOT TO BE CONFUSED with a more inclusive release also known as ""The Complete Invasion.""

-NO SUBTITLES. When did this come out again? 2011? There is no excuse for a DVD to not have subtitles.

Miscellaneous baloney:
-This set splits season two into two boxes for no real reason, except to take up space on your shelf. Not a huge deal, but bugs the heck out of me.
-Note that this set includes the UNCUT version of *The Most Horrible X-mas Ever.*",1489363200,41,922,4.644171779141105

I love this product! Invader Zim was really popular in my time and judging by how high other seller's prices are, they probably still are.

2632921,5,B000HC2LRQ,"The story of a short teen-middle aged mentally unstable alien vs a 7-12 year old mentally unstable human nerd.

This is the best thing I've seen on Nickelodeon since the early 90s ended. It's also the show that made me stop caring about Nickelodeon; Not sure what they were thinking, having the creator of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac do a children's show. They told Jhonen they wanted something edgy for teens, then they put it in inappropriate time slots, refused to sell it to MTV at his request, & ultimately cancelled it; clearly Nick only cares about money & nothing else. God, I just want to buy the rights to this show just so I can give it back to it's creator.

Naturally, Jhonen tried to get as much s*** past the censors as he cold (as Adventure Time does today). Zim will occasionally try to outright kill Dib, Gaz is a serial killer in the making, & many characters will either die offscrene or have near-death experiences. Jhonen says most of the episodes are self-contained with no continuity, so Zim & Dib are probably shown seconds before death at the end of several episodes.

While very toned down from his usual bag of grizzly horrors, his mark is all over this thing; everyone wears knee-high boots, triangular body shapes, screaming, screaming in bathrooms, bulging eyes, goth/punk-like fashion, cartoon violence, neglectful parents, moose, easter eggs in the backgrounds, background characters dying in horrible ways, everyone has ADHD, grungy crapsack world, character filibusters, comedic sociopathy, socially awkward unpopular protagonist, etc.

You will occasionally see characters in the background holding JTHM comics, suggesting that it's a comic in that world, yet Ms. Bitters, Sanguine, Pepito, & Filler Bunny, & Mystic Hill occur in both series. Perhaps Zim takes place in the future. Sadly, no sightings of Nny, Anne, Devi, Squee, Senior Diablo, or Tes yet.

Also you have to see the zombie hog. And by zombie hog I mean the new level that is the directors cut of the most horrible Christmas ever.

Review about the disks themselves: 3 dvd cases with 2 discs each, all inside a cardboard sleeve, each disc has a cool screen print.

I love the fact that this show has also a spanish language track, its like getting two shows, hilarious, so thats a bonus if you understand spanish. Comes with animatics, audio commentaries by the creators, and subtitles in Irkin (?????).

All in all a great show and a great box set, glad i got it when I did, now way I would have paid the current price tag on this.

Excellent show for all ages adult and children alike.  Perhaps if your children are already weird or heading that direction you might want to refrain from letting them watch this show but if your kids are fully aware tv and cartoons are just that and nothing to imitate or perceive as the way to go about things then it's perfect.

The humour of Zim can best be compared to the silliness of Monty Python, the Goons or the Goodies but its stories are filled with a nihilistic contempt for modern life. As such quoting lines probably won't convince you that this show had me nearly crying with laughter.

Having all three seasons works against this set as it includes the half dozen or so episodes that don't quite hit the mark but over all the genius of the other episodes shines through.",1210464000,2,687,4.532258064516129
2633109,5,B000HC2LRQ,"invader zim has to be one of my favourite shows. it's one of those things that has an almost cultish effect on people, well the people who get into it anyways. there are so many awesome quotes in this show... like classic, change you're life-funny quotes. my and my brother sometimes have zim quote battles and see who can come up with the most quotes. and we say them to each other in everyday conversation, or even if we aren't talking, a quote from zim will break the silence. it's like this when i find other people into zim too. when i find out they love it too i'll say a quote and they'll say one back to me... it's like finding a long lost sibling, i love it.

the show itself seems like it's going to be slow-paced when you start watching it, and i guess it can be a bit. it also has a kind of dark atmosphere, so it is to be watched in moderation. i wouldn't recommend watching a whole season in one go unless you're in the mood for it. if you watch too much at once the atmosphere will get to you a bit and the pacing can be depressing, which is an odd contrast to the comedic aspect of the show.

the characters are amazing. zim is set up as an idiot, an outcast, and really bad at what he was meant to do, but i don't think he is the failure we would think he is. zim reminds me of how geniuses are thought to be crazy be those around them and only later are they appreciated. zim is not a genius, but i do think that he's under estimated by everyone on the show. he is successful if some of what he sets out to do, but he's like the coyote from the roadrunner show, he's just got bad luck. dib is most relatable because he is the second main character of the show and we get to see his personality the most of all the characters. even though zim is the main character we don't really relate to him and get inside his head but almost see him through the eyes of someone else. in the shows focusing on dib, maybe because he complains out loud a lot or because he's always searching for something, but it feels more like we are going on the adventure with dib rather than watching from a distance like with zim. dib is also unappreciated by the other characters, but like zim he's actually really smart and not crazy at all, though with dib it's easier to see this than with zim because people think dib is crazy for thinking zim is an alien, and we know that zim is an alien, so we're united by the truth i guess. gaz is a great character and i wish there were more episodes focused on her. she's really irritable, but she's not like any other person on the show in that she has this inner strength, which sets her apart as the odd one out. an example of this would be the episode where pustulio was hypnotizing everyone, but it didn't get gaz because she didn't give it the time of day. and she is shown in this way in a lot of episodes. i guess the fact that the show's focus isn't really on her, even though she is one of the main characters is almost an example of her character. her reluctance to engage in anything makes her a really interesting, and though we'd like to see more of her, maybe the fact that we can't is evidence of her personality. and of course there's gir... little need be said of gir other than the fact that gir is awesome. if there was no gir the show wouldn't be what it is and a lot of the comedy is because of gir, not all, but a lot. unlike the other characters, it seems gir's only purpose is for comedic effect. gir lightens the dark atmosphere of the show.

invader zim is like metal (the music) in that it has a core of die hard fans, but the rest of the world kind of does really know about it. it's a hugely funny show. the comedy is kind of dry and satirical, and slightly over the top and... awesome. just awesome. i recommend it.",1209513600,,3783,4.109459459459459

That's 27 episodes in all. This is an amazing off considering the price of these DVDs if bought separately.

Invader Zim is a dark, disturbing cartoon that looks like someone made it that was insane (but in a good way). The basis of the story is that an alien, Zim, from planet Irk is sent to a mysterious planet on what he thinks is a mission to conquer it. His leaders, The Almighty Tallest, only sent him away to be rid of him for a while. Zim and his robot servant, GIR, just so happen to land on Earth. Sadly, Zim is unequipped to handle the challenges that await him on Earth. To make matters worse for Zim, a child with a huge head named Dib sets out to stop Zim at all costs.

All the episodes are full of laughs and ridiculous screaming. GIR is the funniest character due to his complete randomness and idiotic nature. Some episodes are more based on Dib or Gaz, Dib's Sister, than on Zim, but they are still very well done.

My only complaint with the series is that the episode they used to close out the series, The Most Horrible X-mas Ever, was completely stupid. It introduced a new character named Mini-Moose for no reason at all. The episode itself isn't funny at all compared to other episodes in this box set. Invader Zim went out with a whimper and no closure whatsoever.

March 30, 2001.

I was alone in the den. A ten-year-old boy left to bask in his fantasies. Mom was upstairs, younger brother asleep in bed.

Invader Zim manifested itself onto the television screen. Title screen. Cue the music. Visuals. Instantly, my vision was flooded with colors. Cool, dark, suspenseful colors. And then, the plot.

I believe two half-hour shows ran that night. One to establish the story, and another to lay down the genre of the show. And I became a first-generation fan.

Seven years later, I own all the DVDs, and now I can take myself back to that night, in the comfort of my own room, distraction-free, at any time. This collection is a godsend, no less. I recommend it for die-hard fans, those who want a cheap and effective laugh, those who were referred to it by a friend, or otherwise.

2633160,5,B000HC2LRQ,"This is one of the best collections you can ever buy for its price.

Invader Zim is a comedy/action series at its best.  You don't need to watch the episodes in any particular order (but it does help).  The animation is near top notch and the voice acting is perfect.  It will keep you coming back to watch it over and over again for the ""over-the-top"" episodes and for some good laughs.

The only thing this series is lacking (not necessarily a bad thing) is a storyline that continues through all of the episodes and MORE episodes.  But this series did not need a storyline.  It made up for that with laughs and action.

I highly recommend any anime lover or anyone who likes to watch cartoons, to give this one a try.  It's dirt cheap and the value goes way above your dollar.

Summary:
Music - 10/10
Voicing - 10/10
Animation - 9/10

2633161,5,B000HC2LRQ,"This DVD collection is fabulous. The cartoon starts off hilarious and grows on you. Though produced to DVD by an obscure company (Anime Works), the discs have provided flawless playback and are well chapterized. The packaging is great (3 plastic DVD cases, 2 discs per case, in a cardboard slider case).

The only fault I've noticed so far is that during some of the chapters, the disc makes my player (which is cheap, mind you) show a little icon in the upper right corner that looks like a camcorder inside a gray square. The only other time I've noticed this is while playing an instructional video by a drummer that he produced to DVD himself. I doubt it will happen on most players, and I have no idea what it's supposed to mean since I already lost the manual, but it doesn't hinder playback at all.

My 4 year-old daughter has also been sucked in to the Invader Zim vortex and wants to be GIR for halloween this year.  I cannot believe this series didn't run longer than it did - maybe it was a bit ahead of its time.  There are certain aspects of the storylines & animation that hearken me back to when Ren & Stimpy was new and fresh, but not in any sort of rip-off way that so many animated series are guilty of.  The voice of Zim, performed by Richard Horvitz (Billy's voice on The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy) makes me laugh, no matter what the lines are.  Hilarious!!  It also features other great voice acting by Kevin McDonald (Pleakley on Lilo & Stitch) & Rodger Bumpass (Squidward on Spongebob Squarepants), as well as many guest voices. The stories are funny and the animation is hilarious, being both rebellious & family-friendly at the same time.  I still cannot believe that this 6 DVD set is as cheap as it is.

Unfortunately  they took the show away and I cried for a few years. Luckily now I found the complete series here for only $15.99 how insane is that!

There are only 2 things, only 2! that I was slightly irritated at and they are not a big deal at all.

1. When you pick an episode to watch and it ends it automatically goes on to the next one. Just used to shows defaulting to the episode menu.

2. The ""box"" that holds the 3 dvd set is about as strong as kids construction paper again, used to having my sets in actual boxes.

Like I said though these are just minor irritants and very easy to over look as this is a very great show and such a bargain. I only wanted to post them so others had a heads up and don't get that weird smirked look on their face when they open the box up.

Anyhow buy this set because ""It's not stupid it's advanced!!""

****Overly protective and crazy parents, be forewarned this cartoon does have some excessive cartoon violence and depicts some odd sceans nothing that a normal person would think twice about but this message is for you, the person who won't let his 15 year old kid go to a pg-13 movie, and you the person who thinks movies like 'The Goonies' (or any other 'kids' movie made in the 80's) are too graphic for kids....

So if you're looking for the cheapest soultion to owning all the Invader Zim episodes, this is it. It doesn't get any cheaper, and I'm so amazed how much amazon were ripping themselves off by making this so cheap, because you could buy the dvds singely for $15 each, which makes $60 or buy it in a box shapped like Zim's house with an extra disc full of special features (toy is now discontinued) for $100 - and apparently those special features aren't worth it.

The show is basically about a misfit alien who doesn't fit in with the social hierarchy of his race (based on how tall you are and needless to say, Zim is short).  He is sent on a fake mission by his leaders to get rid of him and ends up on earth.  There is some dark humor in the show that may be a bit much for younger audiences along with references that they wouldn't understand too much.  However, it is very good entertainment for older audiences and can provide hours of good animated fun.  I especially like this set because of the price and the fact that you get every episode ever aired in one box.

Again, Nick makes something on an adult level that sneaks by as a kid's cartoon.  This is a deliciously dark comedy about the most inept but ambitious of alien invaders Zim, and his defective robot sidekick ""GIR"", sent to the most incosequential of planets to invade, earth.

If you haven't watched Invader Zim before, it is a comedy cartoon very much in the same vein as Ren and Stimpy, but more frantic and with less innuendo.  It makes extensive comedic use of hyperbole, commercial stereotypes, and heavy cultural satire.  Grab a few episodes somewhere to see if you like it.

Either way, having established that you like Invader Zim, buy this if you want to watch it more than once.  This is the full box set of the series with everything expected from a box set; good DVD quality video, standard extras; commentary, scenes, specials, etc.  Like basically all series DVD collections, if you didn't like it in the first place, the set probably won't change your mind, but if you do like it, pick the set up to have it all.",1185494400,13,1007,4.530386740331492

You will get everything you need and want from this simple purchase of $16.  For the amount of money the crew had to work with and the time constraints placed on them, they produced a quality piece of work.

It cannot be cleared, so it seems it is part of the dvd playback, though it should not be. It is almost as if someone illegally downloaded it and did not know how to use their movie capture program correctly? I have tried viewing it in two different players, but that made no difference.

There are some episodes that are a little too random, and even a couple that don't include Zim at all that are a little difficult to sit through, But the rest of the series is a completely random romp through... fun... stuff...

My justification:  this DVD set contains 27 episodes, about 23 minutes long apiece.  That's over 10 hours of top-notch content for sixteen bucks (not counting commentary and special features).  A typical movie is two hours for the same price, if you're lucky.

In ""Invader Zim""'s case, the value comes in at pennies per laugh.

This DVD set is money all the way; it's the entire ""Invader Zim"" series in a single package, and it's extremely well done.  The picture is great, the sound is great, and (if you're into this sort of thing) there's a wealth of commentary and extras.  It's a near-perfect production.  If you like ""Invader Zim"", you should pick up this box set forthwith; anything less would be corporal punishment.

(Plus, if you buy the ""complete invasion"" 3-volume set, you are getting the ""uncut"" Christmas episode, unlike the earlier versions of the DVDs that were sold individually, volume-by-volume.)

That said, ""Invader Zim"" isn't for everyone.  If you've never seen it before, download an episode via Amazon or iTunes and give it a gander.  It's weird, dark and terrific, with layers of details that come out with repeated viewings.

It's really hard to go wrong by buying this box set.  It especially makes a great gift; at this price, you can buy box sets all around.",1175731200,71,1433,4.7877551020408164

Anyone on this review page who says otherwise is either reviewing the wrong thing, or THEY LIEEEEE!
If you want commentaries, you can buy the ""Zim house box set"" for upwards of $300, or you can buy the individual DVDs, ""Doom Doom Doom"", ""Progressive Stupidity"" and ""Horrible Holiday Cheer"". You can get those used for cheap.
