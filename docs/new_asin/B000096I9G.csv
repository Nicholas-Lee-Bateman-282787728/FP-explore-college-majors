1880187,5,B000096I9G,This dvd contains the best performances from the cure that i have ever seen.  The special effects that the director through in add so much to the live concert(the future of live recorded concerts).  The Cure prove still after so long they hold the crown to bands such as radiohead and AFI.  A MUST have for any cure fan!,1054771200,,320,4.389830508474576
1880188,5,B000096I9G,"As someone who has been to 25 Cure concerts and has over 700 shows on tape, I can tell you that this is a fantastic presentation of a legendary Cure concert!  Production is excellent.  The video quality is very good with a few artsy bits that enhance the performance without getting in the way.  The audio is mixed well too.  This is one of those good sounding concert DVDs, quality somewhere in between Depeche Mode Night in Paris and NIN All That Could Have Been.
It's a real treat to have songs like A Short Term Effect, Closedown, Cold, Same Deep Water as You, and Untitled in such great quality.  A FANTASTIC encore of If Only Tonight We Could Sleep and The Kiss is included too.  The Kiss is as good a version as I've ever heard.  The 40min interview is good too, all of the band members chime in.
Since they play the albums straight through and there aren't many poppy singles, this DVD is more for hardcore fans.  But even if you just love Disintegration I'd recommend it.  I hope they do a live greatest hits DVD like this one someday too.
The only minor problem I have is with the sound of Robert's 6-string bass on some of the Disintegration tracks.  It's not mixed as strongly as usual during Pictures of You and because of that the song comes off a bit flat.  The 6-string comes alive during Untitled though, probably because Perry is doubling up the lead part.
With everything else being so fantastic, I can't complain- 5 stars!!",1054598400,10,1443,4.448669201520913
1880189,5,B000096I9G,"I have Seen the Cure live, I own many of the Cure's live VHS tapes (Show, in Orange, ect) I have all the Cure's CD's, but this DVD is Cure Perfection. Everything the band is about is caught here on DVD, filmed in High definition video and surround sound. This Concert Sounds beautiful but the film work captures the band almost as good as seeing them live, take it from me. They play their 3 darkest and richest albums live in full completion plus two encore songs. This DVD is worth every cent and more. This is a cure fans dream, and anyone else who enjoys high quality emotional, dark, music. There will never be another group like the Cure and this DVD is your chance to see them in all their glory.

1880190,5,B000096I9G,"Altough this DVD was to be released in the beginning of next week, my loyal music shop called me today and handed this dvd for me. Just finished enjoying three hours of old and new time classics and I'm thrilled. It must have been an exhausting show for the band, but every minute of it is full of energy and retrospectical melancholy and power. Never again will a band be able to put something together like this... to put together three of their strongest albums and make it seem like their connected for all times... best euro's spend this season...",1054252800,7,552,4.53

Pornography, Disintegration And Blood Flowers. The actual concerts were recorded across two nights in Berlin in
November in 2002. Trilogy was mixed in 5.1 at Olympic,
mastered at Abbey Road and authored at Interactive.

1880242,5,B000096I9G,"Great concert.  No surprises there, but here's the kicker:

Disintegration is notorious for being a brilliant album that was terribly mixed/engineered.  I bought the 180 gram double LP and that was particularly bad!  Well watch it on this DVD through a decent video/audio set-up and you will be amazed at the difference!  This is how it was supposed to sound!",1489536000,,359,4.916666666666667
1880243,5,B000096I9G,"This is live Cure at its best!  I have always considered their mid to late eighties line up of Smith, Gallup, Williams, Thompson, and Tolhurst to be their greatest lineup both in terms of the albums they made and their live shows, but Trilogy makes a solid case for the sheer live power of Smith, Gallup, O'Donnell, Bamonte, and Cooper.  The performance is brilliant and the audio mix is astonishing.  The Pornography set sounds HUGE... heavy and thunderous.  Disintegration sounds lush, dreamy, and beautiful. And the Bloodflowers set was a huge bonus for me- being an album that I enjoyed when it came out, but not nearly to the extent that I indulged in the earlier two albums.  The Bloodflowers songs, in my opinion, sound so much better here on Trilogy than they do on the recorded album itself.  From the powerful opening of ""One Hundred Years"" straight through to the brilliant encore and finally the interviews with all of the band members reflecting on the experience of Trilogy from it's conception to it's release, this is a completely riveting watch for any Cure fan.",1486944000,3,1079,4.805405405405406

1880335,5,B000096I9G,"The Cure's Trilogy show in Berlin from November 2002 is a concert experience that is edgy, heart-pounding and a MASTERPIECE of what purely defines *quintessential* Cure songs. I still own the original DVD of this unforgettable concert performance of ALL the songs from that dark, foreboding trilogy-Pornography, Disintegration, Bloodflowers-and after having seen the filmed performance at least 4 or 5 times, I feel as if I'm actually there in that audience, belting out all the lyrics along with my fellow Cure followers. Now that I own this EXCELLENT concert on blu-ray, it absolutely has been worth EVERY penny spent!!!! Of the Cure's Trilogy albums, my two most faves are Pornography and Bloodflowers. The sonic landscape of Pornography paints a canvas of my late teens-early 20s emotions-helplessness, fear, anger and rage. The sonic landscape of Bloodflowers paints a canvas of my late 20s-early 30s emotions-anger (with a conscience), regret, brooding introspection and sorrowful isolation. Watching this live performance has ALWAYS been uplifing AND cathartic for this Cure fan, whose life has always been a psychological struggle, yet through the therapy of listening to the Cure's finest music (as well as many other types of music), one that has made this surviving soul stronger than ever!!!!

Just to add, if you watch this electrifying, edgy performance with Sony XB400 headphones (I've done this for the past 3 times), you will DEFINITELY be blown away; Robert Smith's vocals are fantastically crisp and clear and the bass, crunchy jangling guitars and drums will all rock your ears AND soul to their very core!!!!",1417046400,2,1629,5.289575289575289

I have enjoyed it several times now and plan on seeing it again quite a few more times in the future!,1395273600,,258,4.078431372549019
1880342,5,B000096I9G,"Some of the concerts I'd seen/heard from this line-up (via 'unofficial media'...traded, NOT purchased) left a bit to be desired so I didn't know what to expect.  'Disintegration' and 'Bloodflowers' were two of my favorite Cure albums so hopes were high.

The 'Pornography' set is very well done but still ranks third in enjoyability.  The original album was somewhat poorly produced so the very fine sound on this release is quite welcome.  One Hundred Years may be a best-ever performance, have never heard/seen a better one.  The lighting during this song is particularly good.  The rest of the set is quite good, The Hanging Garden and The Figurehead being standouts.  I was really looking forward to Strange Day but the bass is massively over-driven and even more massively out of tune.  These discs were recorded over two nights and the better versions of the songs used for the release.  It's difficult to imagine how the rejected version of Strange Day sounded considering the horrifyingly bad sound of the released version.  The band seems to have been of the opinion that the second night was the better of the two nights.  No dates were given as to which songs came from which night.

'Disintegration' ranks second of three in enjoyability.  The only song that really stands out is The Same Deep Water As You.  I'm not saying the set is lacking in any way. The songs are performed consistently at a very high standard and it's difficult to pick a high point.  Deep Water does stand out, due partly to the fact that it live performances were extremely rare and the fact that the band really gave it their all on the night.

'Bloodflowers' is the most enjoyable of the three sets but not by much.  Out Of This World starts things off nicely.  Watching Me Fall has always seemed to me to be slightly out of place on the 'Bloodflowers' album.  It's heavy and overt (as opposed to subtle like the rest of the album) and just...different.  I still like it and the lighting during this song is particularly entertaining.  Where The Birds Always Sing is an excellent song and is one of those rare songs which has lyrics in which is contained an element of pure truth.  Gotta love it.  The guitar solo bit is exactly the same as the solo bit in Last Day Of Summer.  It fits much better in Last Day Of Summer so I'm guessing Summer was written first and Birds written second and when it came time for the solo, Smith thought 'hey, lemme try this...wow, that almost fits'.  'Almost' being the key word there.  Maybe Someday another excellent track, one that survived the next line-up change and was played on the 2008 tour.  The Last Day Of Summer is an excellent track, in my opinion one of the all-time-great Cure tunes.  The guitar solo bit on the album was played with a bit of bite but Smith cut way back on the distortion for the live version and while it is still well played I find it less enjoyable than the studio version.  The last song, Bloodflowers, may be the highlight of the entire set.  The beginning of the song would sit nicely anywhere on either side of New Order's 'Movement' album.  I don't mean to prejudice you one way or the other, it just would.  Bloodflowers is another example of an all-time-great Cure tune, both musically and lyrically.  I would categorize the lyrics as the absolute apex of Smith's philosophy of life.  A couple more examples would be the Buzzcocks 'I Believe' and even George Carlin's 'There Is No God' bit.  It's as if all the previous material got distilled down into a single piece of pure truth and insight, the underlying theme of an entire body of work finely defined.  That's Bloodflowers.  The rest of the trip may be all downhill, but coming down from the astonishing height of Bloodflowers means we'll be flying far, far higher than everyone else for a long time yet.

The encores were needed as sort of stabilizing, back-to-earth pieces.  If Only Tonight... is thoroughly unenjoyable.  The lyrics to The Kiss are hilarious.

There are a few what used to be called 'easter eggs' and they are generally alternate camera angles of the songs to which they are attached.  Interesting but not particularly earth-shaking or enlightening.  Mostly the how, why and where regarding the Trilogy concerts, and the fact that whatever Robert says is law.  There is a great 'egg' attached to one of the portions of Simon's interview.  The interviewer asks Simon if he had ever met Sid Vicious.  His reply is priceless.

The interview is marginally informative but gives everyone an opportunity to put voices to faces, particularly Jason, Simon, Perry and Roger.",1392076800,,4605,4.705882352941177

1880377,5,B000096I9G,"I have been a Cure fan since the mid-80s when a friend first introduced me to them with their ""Pornography"" album while I was still in high-school.

In 1989 I purchased ""Disintegration"" - which still remains not only my favorite Cure release, but also my favorite album of all time by any band. Period. ""Disintegration"" is quite possibly an album that I have listened to at least every single month since 1989.

I admit, after Disintegration, I kind of lost interest in obtaining the more recent Cure releases until recently buying a copy of ""Bloodflowers"" a few days after purchasing and listening to this Blu-Ray. The Cure's 80's releases always held a special place in my heart, and now I am kicking myself for not obtaining ""Bloodflowers"" much sooner. I can understand now why Robert Smith has stated that these three albums define The Cure. ""Bloodflowers"" is much better than I expected and deserves a place in this Trilogy.

Insofar as the blu-ray itself, I am happy with the visuals and sound quality. As for the performances, they are very tight on the whole and offer little deviation from the original studio releases - which is no bad thing at all.",1352764800,3,1159,4.756218905472637

Concert: The Cure plays well here, though I do think that a lot of songs sound to familiar to one another. Maybe this is because I'm not a fan, but with a few exceptions there aren't that much standouts. Don't expect a wild performance neither, as they are more focussed on their performance than on any stage theatrics.

Video: Great video quality, this was being shot with a HD camera. There is a good variety of long shots and close ups and a easy editing style (so no MTV style esque 2 second shots).

Audio: Once again this Blu ray shows its merit in the audio department, with a great distinction between instruments (I was always able to make out the different instruments) and they have a good impact to them (in one of the rare instances a guitar solo occurs, it really enveloped the soundstage).

1880383,5,B000096I9G,"Can't really say anything more than this is an absolutely spectacular Blu-Ray.  Doesn't seem to be shot in true 1080, but it's as good as 720 gets.  The sound is awesome, Smith's vocals are crisp and clean, you can pick out every word.  The bottom end is substantial and weighty.  I'm playing ""Plainsong"" over and over, louder each time, and burning speaker fuses like crazy, I've gone through two five packs already because of this disc.

If you like Disintegration, it is a real treat to see these songs live.  A must for anybody who enjoys the Cure.  There are no disappointments on this disc.",1298160000,3,596,4.619047619047619

1880385,3,B000096I9G,The Cure trilogy was good. My main criticism is that I had to pay additional Customs charge of 12.95 (approx 20 US dollars). Thi Ther was no indication that this had to be paid in addition to postage.,1286409600,,200,4.2894736842105265

The production quality is probably the best I've seen on any concert video, and the audio was flawless. I cranked my new Onkyo receiver to +10Db and shook the house during most of the Disintigration portion of this 3 concert disc. It felt like we were in the crowd!

I always liked their music, mostly from the Disintegration album and like many others considered it dark but a great release from the ordinary... Believe me when I say this is a far departure from the music I normally listen to and enjoy, yet it has a haunting way of getting under my skin, in a good way...  Having never seen them live before this DVD gave me then opportunity to do that.  On the Blu-Ray format it is a beautifully produced concert DVD with an outstanding sound mix and the visuals are equally as impressive...  It gave me the opportunity to hear the other albums that I might not have given a chance except for this DVD... Although my favorite is still Disintegration, Pornography blew me away... And I don't mean to take anything away from Bloodflowers set, as it was outstanding as well... You won't see any flashy stage show other than the lighting, but rather a very tight band doing what they do best... Playing music... As a musician myself I can defintely appreciate that... A must see for any avid The Cure fan and a great venue for anyone new to their music...",1278979200,2,1154,4.433962264150943

One of the best - if not best - concert DVDs I've ever seen. They didn't ruin it (as so many are) by putting in too many crowd shots, screaming fans or non-concert footage. The focus is where it should be - on the band. Sound quality is stellar as is the video. And the music...need I say more?",1268784000,,338,4.121212121212121

1880390,3,B000096I9G,"Been a Cure fan forever.  This video's pretty good, I have no qualms with the performance.  Here are a couple of criticisms I can add to the mix though:  The video quality is good but not great.  HD is not always the same; I can see differences in broadcasts on cable and from other sources and the HD off this blu-ray is not the best I've ever seen.  It almost looks kinda quasi-HD compared to some of my other BD's played on the same equipment.  Also, a note on the audio mix/equalization from a life-long musician-- the bass guitar is not EQ'd right at all.  Not enough low end, way too much mid.  It's not too bad though, you can always adjust for it.",1264982400,,655,4.225806451612903
1880391,5,B000096I9G,"Robert Smith's brief interview in the bonus materials, oddly, gave me one of the most memorable moments from this show. Paraphrasing as best I can: ""We loved the coldness of Berlin for these two concerts. I love a city like Barcelona, too, maybe if we do a show like this with the Kiss Me record,"" he says. ""But these albums have some very cold songs on them, and they made us feel like a young band again. I mean, with this set list, we open with a fast, angry song, and that's something young bands do.""

People love these records, of course, and it's easy to imagine The Cure responding to suggestions to play these shows...but I was curious why they would. Once you see the songs all laid end to end, played so intensely and deftly, though, it makes more than perfect sense. It's emotionally exhausting hearing all these tunes together in the familiar order from listening to the records. The stage production is beautiful, and the sound is great, but they definitely make an effort to keep you focused on the music they're playing. Nothing overly distracts from that, and the playing is really solid. They never take any big improvisational leaps, but the songs feel fresh and energetic throughout.

Most dramatic of all is probably the title track from Pornography. In the half dozen or so times I have watched the show, that's been the most arresting tune most often. Capturing so much of the complexity of angst and alienation in an instrumental is such a great moment in their catalog, anyway, but they play it so fiercely that it draws you in, while simultaneously reminding you of phase after phase of mood after mood that you just wish you could shake. But you know there's so much honesty and validity in the art of the tune, even though the vibe keeps telling you to stay away, that you don't want any part of what it feels like is happening. People make fun of the love/hate relationship some people seem to have with their own emotions, but it's hard to imagine those few minutes of Pornography not feeling like a universal experience to anyone who happens to come across them.

Even 20. 25 years later, this show still has the same effect on me that those early Cure records did--you finish listening to it, and you feel all wrung out and compelled to get up and do something, but you can't figure out what you're in the mood to go do. Maybe that's the power of good music, or good art of any kind--leaves you feeling raw and all jacked up, but you can't always tell why.",1264118400,,2488,4.524444444444445
1880392,5,B000096I9G,"The Kiss is one of my favorite Cure songs so I was excited that it was included in the encore.  It didn't disappoint.  As for the three main sets, I enjoyed Pornography the best (that album continues to find ways to surprise and astonish me) but Disintegration and Bloodflowers were also top-notch.

Essential just for the experience of having all three albums together and the price is extremely reasonable.",1250640000,,408,4.884057971014493
1880393,5,B000096I9G,"This is a great DVD and it is well worth the price I paid for it. The performances really do justice to the Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers albums,and the sound quality is great. The purchase is worth it just for the Bloodflowers set, but the whole thing is entertaining. The band is not off key, as some reviewers have said, but rather it's a live performance, which usually sounds a little different from the album tracks. Anyway, if you watch the bonus interviews with the band (which are worthwhile), you will learn that The Cure played all three of the ""trilogy"" albums in their entirety on two separate dates in Berlin. Only the better of the two performances of each song (as judged by Robert Smith) were included on the DVD. Therefore, even if something may have been off key in the concert, which is doubtful, it wouldn't have happened two nights in a row on the same song, and therefore would not have made it onto the DVD. That said, I am completely satisfied with this video and really $10 for a brand new two disc DVD (over 3 hours of concert footage) isn't really splurging, especially for a fan of The Cure.",1249603200,,1136,4.573529411764706

1880412,5,B000096I9G,"This had previously been the greatest live concert ever released on any format, and now it just got better!

When I purchased the DVD of this live show, filmed in Berlin, a number of years ago I was astounded at how amazing it was. I have seen The Cure 10 times throughout the course of my life, and own every studio release, video release, and many bootlegs; yet I still was not prepared for just how unbelievably incredible this performance would be.

Now, years later, after many throw away Blu-ray concert releases from artists without half the talent of The Cure, we finally get 'Trilogy' in beautiful High-definition; and boy was it worth the wait!

The audio sounds flawless, and the picture quality is light-years better than the already very good looking DVD. This is how you release a live concert on Blu-ray; looks perfect, sounds perfect, and the content is second to none.

The Cure combine a live show of three intrinsically linked albums, 'Pornography', 'Disintegration', and 'Blood Flowers' to give fans the ultimate Blu-ray that could ever be asked for.

The supplements even shine, with a 2 song encore consisting of 'If Only Tonight We Could Sleep' and 'The Kiss' from the album 'Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me', as well as backstage footage and other goodies.

Whether you are a Blu-ray fan, a Cure fan, a live concert fan, or even a moderate fan of any of these things, you owe it to yourself to have this on your shelf.

Very possibly the best live concert that will ever be released.",1233792000,18,1501,4.662878787878788

1880434,4,B000096I9G,"It's not very usual having the chance to watch contemporary bands performing live their whole album recordings, perhaps because they haven't managed to arrange the songs properly when it comes to play them on stage, perhaps because it's not easy to bring them live without the appropriate instrumentation and mixing consoles originally used in the studio, or just because only the most relevant singles are brought onto the live experience, simply skipping the remaining cuts...

Whatever it is that makes today's bands not to play their whole albums integrity, it's a relief to see how The Cure performs and record live their 'black albums' in a whole, beautifully shot along with a cristal clear sound.

Only shame / remark [for which I'm not giving the whole 5 stars] would be the poor and cheap packaging production for such a great material, and the fact that some of the guitars and drums don't sound as if they were played by the original Cure's lineup, but that's the deal folks: it's not the original Cure's lineup, so some slight differences with the original albums may be expected.

Everything else is simply perfect.

Contents: 5 stars.

Packaging: 2 stars.

So this is it: the whole enchilada plus some valuable extra features and some hidden easter eggs... as:

DISC 1:

1) Once in the ""Disintegration Set"" menu, highlight ""Plainsong"" and move the cursor to the left. Then click ok/enter and watch a split screen version of ""Plainsong"" from both nights, shot by Robert's handheld camera.

2) Also on the ""Disintegration Set"" menu, highlight ""Same Deep Water as You"" and move the cursor to the left. Click ok/enter and watch the full version of ""Same Deep Water as You"" from the ""Robertcam"".

DISC 2:

1) In the Interview menu, highlight ""End of an Era?"", and move the cursor to the left. Click ok/enter and some outtakes from the interviews will popup.

1880439,5,B000096I9G,"there is no Cure fan that should be without this. UNBELIEVABLE!!! the only thing that might trip some folks up (as it did me) is the fact that the albums are played in order, and therefore you might find it hard to make it past the first set! (just like me. ""pornography"" is my favorite Cure record to begin with, and the versions of no less than EVERY SINGLE SONG from that album are wonderful, man.)

i hate to admit it, but honestly, i so far have not seen all of the second and/or third sets. (second set through ""fascination street"", and only ""watching me fall"" from ""bloodflowers"", but all mentioned are AWESOME!)

that being said, i'd STILL call this DVD a must-have for long-time Cure fans, but also, i'd suggest this as a great Point A for anyone that might be interested in getting into the band, as you'll immidiately have three of their most famous and popular records for the price of barely more than one of the albums individually. (and considerably less than any of the recent re-issues.)

also, the re-creation of these songs (with the exception of ""lullaby"", which i prefer live) is so true that it really will give you a SUPERB idea of whether or not you might like to hear more of these fellows.

All three albums are fantastic, and as one of the reviewers mentioned, the sound quality is excellent and is arguably better than the originals, even when I am using my ""1999 bottom-of-the line"" speakers that I bought as a student.

It is interesting how well all these albums have stood the test of time, although the Bloodflowers isn't that old, I suppose. I highly recommend this DVD.",1162166400,,494,4.67816091954023

No matter, if you miss the cure and have seen them or are a seasoned fan waiting to see them live soon this is the DVD to have.  Trilogy links 3 albums. Pornography, disintigration, and Bloodflowers.  I don't understand how they go together but, the DVDs are outstanding.  Filmed in Berlin because, we all know Germany has the most Dark music fans in the world.

Although some might argue the disc isn't filmed well because there are not alot of visuals we have to remember it is the music and live performance we're after.  The Cure do normally use more visuals than what are used in the making of the dvd but, we are not buying it to see a circus.  This is the Cure.  Enjoy them for what they are worth.  If you like visuals it shouldn't matter what band you go to see...

Who would I suggest this too..... Serious Cure fans.  Especially with the low price.  You can't beat amazons price for the brand new DVD since it was orginally selling twice the price.  Thank god music video prices dropped.  I feel like I've stolen this product... Regardless this is not an action film but a great way to remember the live cure sound and see the cure over and over again for the worlds best price.  A+  This DVD is a must.

As for content.... 3CDs played in Full back to back.  I don't know if it's ever been done.  but the cure did it so lovely!",1149897600,,1420,4.227611940298507

Very entertaining, well done show with great setlist, picture quality and sounding. If you are a real Cure fan, you just simply cannot go wrong with this purchase.

The biggest suprise was for me the Bloodflowers set. While I consider Disintegration a better album overall, I enjoyed the Bloodflowers set the most. And the Pornography set the least.

All the musicians give an outstanding performance, may be except Perry. His guitar playing just seems to be average. Simon is great on the bass as always, Roger is confidently playing and true to the album versions, Jason ""drums like a dream"" (RS). And of course, Robert's voice and guitars are excellent.

It would be good to see The Head On The Door, Kiss Me and Wish albums on another trilogy tour - but it's just a wish, I know.

Still, here is this concert that will please every Cure fan out there. This show is better alone than previous Cure concerts all together.",1127692800,5,1000,4.691428571428571

Video is excellent, sound quality is good but the way they recorded the individual band accoustic volume levels needed work.  There are many songs as you know where Robert Smith's guitar should be more distinct or louder than the others.  Each band member seemed to drown eachother out to create a loud mess of guitars playing at the same audio level.  ""Same deep water as you"" and ""Plain Song""  are a perfect exsample of this.

Bottom line (there's that dreaded bottom line again )this is ESSENTIAL viewing/listening experience of the Cure. The live set of Pornography blows the studio version  completely out of the water ( listen to the live versions of these songs on the recent reissue of Pornography and tell me I'm wrong). The Disintegration set is faithful to a fault - I was in Atlanta for the Prayer Tour in 1990 - and I don't hear anything out of place or off key ( as others are saying ) in the performance or the mix. As for the Bloodflowers set, I didn't see the shows, but I can assure anyone on the fence that the live versions here  are quite on par with the studio versions. Overall, this is a real treat for Cure fans, the sound mix  is fantastic, the visuals are subtle but very effective, and the experience as a whole is the next best thing to ""being there."" Sure, some songs are performed slower than the original studio versions, some a bit faster, but that's what makes a concert. Enough said. Buy it.

1880455,5,B000096I9G,"While I enjoyed everything I knew from the Cure thoroughly, this DVD really put them higher as far as my respect for them than ever before. Part of the greatness is in that these already-wonderful tracks are put in the DVD, especially how they performed three albums in entirety, and what's even better is the other stuff, like the explaining of what they did. Also, the encore gave me a better appreciation for those two songs than ever before.

This is especially great if you like the theme of the albums. Each of these are done greatly. While The Cure was just a trio in the 'Pornography' era, there is more emphasis with more musicians in this rendition, full of nothing but strongpoints. I especially liked the performances of ""One Hundred Years"" and ""The Hanging Garden"".

The longest and the best is the 'Disintegration' set, which is done a bit different. I love the way that ""Lullaby"" is performed (in part to bassist Simon Gallup) and especially what's done in the first minute of ""Pictures of You"", one of my all-time favorite songs. ""Love Song"" has a nice guitar solo added as well as having more emphasis of keyboard than the album version. Which is good with me, since to me I feel that the keyboards make the song. He adds some German lingo in at the end of the already-wonderful ""Fascination Street"", particularly because it's the Berlin show of the trilogy.

The 'Bloodflowers' material is done well too, with super long songs that were in the set to begin with. I always loved ""Watching Me Fall"" so it was nice to see that one done. And Robert does use the 12-string on that track. Many other great things.

To me, this shines in two moments: Both 'Kiss Me' tracks, ""If Only Tonight We Could Sleep"" and ""The Kiss"". Seeing this DVD and being a guitar player, the Cure have given me a lot of ideas on that since this. Especially the former, with a classical/gothic style in its first two minutes. As well as Robert's guitar playing, with that cool scratching/sliding. ""The Kiss"" is a nice, agressive song and has the energy done right.

In the extras is mainly the inspiration of why they came up with the trilogy idea, if that's the end, and what the direction of the Cure's future would be. While some of that seems to be answered, it's nice seeing what they say on this.

I don't know how a Cure fan could not want this, as it's something to be proud of. It transformed me from thinking that they were great legends to a band that will always matter to me because of good talent and guitar.",1121558400,3,2510,4.5176211453744495
1880456,5,B000096I9G,"I live in a rather crap town 8 hours from Winnipeg. And a lot of bands either only hit Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver and nothing else or they do hit Winnipeg. 8 hours to see one damn band for less than 2 hours! So that's where concert DVD's come in handy. On this, you get 3 albums performed in their entirety but therein may lay a problem.

The Pornography set to be quite honest didn't really catch my full attention. Either it's because the songs hadn't quite caught on with me yet or it's just not good. So either it's a set/record that you have to re-listen to to ""get it"" or it just plain sucks no matter how many times, beats me. Next up is the Disintegration and probably my favorite set since it contains stuff like Pieces of You, Closedown, Fascination Street and Love Song.

The Bloodflowers set is just mildly ok, there's a couple good songs like opener Out of This World but as a whole it's like Pornography, may require repeated listens/watches. Disappointly the encores are just weak in terms of quantity: you get If Only Tonight I Could Sleep and The Kiss, 2 admittedly great cuts from Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me but where's Letter to Elise? Just Like Heaven? Killing an Arab? Forest? Hell I'd even take the cutesy-but-catchy-as-hell Friday I'm in Love.

As for the sound/picture quality, it's nice and sharp and the instruments ring clear although sometimes if you have Robert playing an instrument(which is kinda often), one instrument might get drowned out. Also Robert's vocals are a little off sometimes. It's kinda depressing in a way to not hear his clear perfect ""if only I thought of the right words"" bridge from Pictures of You here but oh well.

The bonus features are nice if maybe a tad short but they're just bonus to having 3 whole albums performed live with great sound. Now bring on a traditional live release and perform in Winnipeg for once damnit",1117670400,,1881,4.572700296735905
1880457,5,B000096I9G,"As a die hard Cure fan, I can't believe what I'm reading.  People claiming this work does not compare with classic cure songs like `Friday I'm in Love'???  Most ""reviewers"" seem to cite `Disintegration' as The Cure's high point, and even that bothers me.  The Cure was at their peak when the released most of their albums.  What made them great was that they changed their flavor, but remained true to what they really were.  `Disintegration' marked another change in their style which was far from my favorite.  I would say `Faith' and `Pornography' are their strongest works, but all Cure albums have the same experimental element with retention of certain fundamentals which can only be defined as `The Cure'.

The new album is no exception.  I would have to say they self-titled the album as a gentle reminder to the many who have borrowed from Cure works that borrowing is fine but stealing is not.  There is only room for one Cure, and Mega Smith (that's a South Park reference) will make sure it stays that way by making imitation impossible.  Each song represents a tour of past, present and future(?) of their illustrious catalog.

I would say the new album is great.  You've listened to them over 20 years; you can risk ten bucks on them, can't you?  If you have never listened to The Cure before (I doubt you would be reading this let alone be exposed to this album if that was the case,) this might not be the best starting point.  Try `Three Imaginary Boys', `Faith' or `Pornography', then go back for this one.  And if your favorite Cure song is `Friday I'm in Love', do Robert, Simon and the boys a favor and don't discourage others from enjoying one of the last examples of true musical pop-art",1115769600,6,1710,4.597359735973598
1880458,4,B000096I9G,"Watching this incredibly long concert set covering the albums ""Pornography,"" ""Disintegration,"" and ""Bloodflowers,"" dubbed the ""(Dark) Trilogy"" is like taking a trip back to the years 1982, 1989, and 2000, respectively. It's an incredible, incredible experience... somehow, despite his rather poor physical aging, the godlike Robert Smith has been able to maintain his voice and playing like few other artists can. From the clenching opener ""100 years,"" to the closing numbers on ""Bloodflowers,"" the band (especially Simon Gallup) are tight, in-tune, and incredibly energetic. Coming from a group in their mid-40s, this is an incredible feat.

This is an incredible DVD for anyone interested in The Cure, even the casual fan. Be sure to check out the newly released reissues of ""Seventeen Seconds,"" ""Faith,"" and ""Pornography.""

1880460,5,B000096I9G,"I want to clear somethng up here. The reviewer below who said that the notes in ""closedown"" (one of my personal favorites)were ""off key"" is just wrong, and obviously doesn't understand musical terms. While the notes on the keyboard ARE different than on the album, that doesn't make them ""off key"" There are many notes that you can use in a scale and still be in key. Being OFF key would mean playing a note OUT of the scale, or one that is not in tune with the rest of the song.

What kind of idiot are you trying to make Robert Smith look like by saying he didn't catch the change in the keys before he could ""edit"" the video? This is a man who has been writing music professionally for almost 30 years; a man who records, sequences, programs and masters countless numbers of tracks in his own home studio. And you're sitting here telling people that YOU caught an error in HIS music that he let slide? Give me a break.

I know that it can be dissapointing to people to hear their favorite bands play a song differently in a live show when they're so used to hearing it the way they have for years on an album. Sometimes the song just doesn't have the same effect.

But you have to understand, performing a song the exact same way for YEARS and YEARS can probably get very tiring and boring. Musicians sometimes just need to use their creativity and try new things - but that doesn't make playing a different note a mistake.

For the record, the keyboards are also different (on this video and other live performances as well) on other songs including ""lovesong""

This video is a MUST HAVE for cure fans. I am going to watch again right now :)

 the sound quality is crystal clear, surpassing the original recording of pornography even. the visuals are great, some interesting camerawork but nothing too over the top.

 robert is in fine voice and the band sound great together. my personal favorite parts are the pornography set and the encore (the kiss is particularly stunning).

 although it only contains material from 4 of their 13 albums, this is by far the best cure performance video out there. highly recommended to die-hard cure fans and lovers of live music. do yourself a favor and pick this up. trust me, you will not be disappointed!",1091577600,4,708,4.907563025210084

1880477,5,B000096I9G,"I had an opportunity to see The Cure live during the second date of their Curiosa Festival in Tampa, along with some of the bands they've influenced in the course of the past decade or so. This DVD, recorded in Berlin in November 2002 reflects the current musical state of the band, except that it misses on their latest self-titled album. But for some it may better that way. ""Trilogy"" presents live versions of three of the band's (arguably) best albums: 'Pornography', 'Disintegration' and 'Bloodflowers', along with an encore set made up of ""If Only Tonight We Could Sleep"" and ""The Kiss"" (from their 'Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me' album).

 This is an essential buy for serious The Cure fans and a highly recommendable live DVD set for the newcomer into the band's music, since it provides the viewer with a complete experience: a very well produced musical recording, along with the visuals of a great show (much like the one you could catch, if you saw them live these days) and a video with excellent direction.",1090886400,33,1016,4.702247191011236

The sound quality on this DVD is amazing, its really good, and the picture, I like it alot, with all the lighting and movement with the music, it goes great with it, I love watching the ""Pornogrophy"" set, BloodFlowers is My Second Favorite, I Love that album, and Disintegration is really good too, but I'd have to say its My Least Favorite on This DVD, Its an awesome set, but It may be because I'm most familiar with that Album than I am the rest and I realized that its a little different, especially ""LoveSong"" I couldn't wait to hear that song when I put this DVD in for the first time, but It was too different. My Most favorite part on The DVD is prolly the Encore tho, it is SO AWESOME, they play a few songs off of ""Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me"", I Love ""The Kiss"" Part, Robert was Jamming on Guitar and Screaming Like Crazy, It Rules!. another part on the DVD that is cool is how they always zoom in on the keyboardest, He never moves, SomeTimes they zoom in on His face and He doesnt Blink, its sorta freaky sometimes, but its completly awesome, I recomend This DVD to any Cure fan, and anyone who has or hasn't seen them live, I love this DVD and watch it alot, I Can't Wait to see them in July (2004), its gonna rule!, Check This DVD out, it rules!

I did not find fault with any of the songs - i never expected them to be studio perfect. the imperfection of the performance gave the impression that the band is just human after all.

1880480,5,B000096I9G,"ok, yes it's true that the songs aren't the same as on the albums. in this case that's not necessarily a bad thing. when songs are played live hundreds of times, you have to expect some variation and improvisation.

 visually, the dvd is rather.. quiet. The Cure has never been known as a particularly rocking band as far as a stage show, rather the songs are deep and moving all on their own. the visual cuts and blurs during the Pornography set are quite good though.
 sonically, it's amazing. having only heard The Cure on studio CDs, hearing and seeing them live is quite an experience. the energy and passion put into the songs live, is simply breathtaking.
 while all three sets are very good, for me the Pornography set stands out. listening to it, i heard some of the most amazing sounds i've ever heard in a song. to say that's it's not like the album is something like saying A Clockwork Orange, the film, wasn't quite as good as A Clockwork Orange, the literary work. they're both masterpieces in respective mediums.

The music from all 3 sets has so much energy and crispness that it feels like you are watching them live.

1880504,5,B000096I9G,"This is something that most Cure fans have probably waited for since the invention of the DVD, an accurate, vivid portrayal of The Cure on stage. After seeing The Cure twice on the ""Dream Tour"", I've spent the past four years looking for bootlegs and such, and this is much better than any bootleg I can find. The 'Pornography' set is the most enlightening one because they've performed these songs much, much less than the ones from the other two sets (save 'One Hundred Years' which has been a staple of every tour since the Porn Tour). Robert even said that 'A Short Term Effect' hasn't been done since the Porn Tour in 1982, in Europe. In a live setting, these songs sound just as intense and abrasive as their studio counterpart. Jason does a great job on the drums, definitely outdoing Lol Tolhurst. The 'Disintegration' set is much like the album, dreamy and visual. The lighting on 'Plainsong' is just plain beautiful, and the spider backdrop of 'Lullaby' is just plain cool (makes me wonder why they never did it on the Dream Tour). The 'Bloodflowers' set is just as I remembered it, and with the exception of a few tune-ups, is almost a sterile reproduction of the studio work. (Echo effects on Robert's voice on the ""YEAH!"" in 'Watching Me Fall' and a drum machine used on 'There Is No If...' like on the 2000 versions). The encore performances of 'If Only Tonight We Can Sleep' and 'The Kiss', both from the 'Kiss Me' album break the flow of the 'Trilogy', but who cares, they are phenominal performances and make this DVD even more amazing. (Check out 'The Kiss'!!) This only makes me thirst for more live performances on DVD, I'd love to upgrade my VCD of 'In Orange' to DVD.
The sound quality is superb and the video quality is as well. The production of the disc is good, and the menus are all easy to use. If there's one thing about this DVD that I do not like, it's the very, very fast-paced editing in some of the more aggressive songs like 'Pornography' and 'Fascination Street', along with the really cheesy digital effects used to make some of these songs seem almost like music videos (like cutting to scenes of static and distorting the images during 'Pornography'). The hidden extras aren't anything worth watching more than once.
Go to the Disintegration set, click left on 'Plainsong' and hit enter, and that'll give you a split screen viewing of the song.
Do the same thing for 'The Same Deep Water As You' and it'll give you the 'Robert-cam' view of the performance. Nothing too enlightening...

Live performances tend to have mess-ups... oh well.  This is an absolutely awe-inspiring collection of music.  Pornography is brilliant, with its horrific/nightmarish visuals & sounds.  Disintegration is beautiful, showcasing the bands use of mid-80's keyboard effects.  And Bloodflowers, the true surprise.  A fantastic realization of a great Cure album.  This is truly the more guitar driven of the 3, but you can really feel Robert Smith during this set... incredible.  If that wasn't enough, the performance of ""The Kiss"" as an encore is, alone, almost worth the price of the DVD.  This is ESSENTIAL for any true Cure fan.",1075075200,,781,5.078740157480315
1880506,5,B000096I9G,"The three best Cure albums (OK, maybe Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me should be in there) are now on a 2 DVD set and performed live.  The sound quality is excellent and obviously the songs are quite good.  Another positive is that the set makes the Pornography album sound a bit updated-- the original 1982 CD sounds like it was recorded in, well, 1982.  Electronic drums and things like that.
It is a lot to take in in one sitting though, and they are not exactly the happiest songs that Smith and Co. perform.  Still, the only problem to me is that the bassline in ""Strange Day"" sounds grossly out of tune to my ear, and some of the visual effects on the songs are distracting.  I guess you have to do that to liven up the atmosphere a bit though.
Arguably the best part of the DVD is not any of the songs they perform in the main set, but the encore in which they close with ""The Kiss"".  You get a whole new appreciation for that song seeing it live.",1070755200,2,945,4.136612021857924
1880507,4,B000096I9G,"The disclaimer on the box reads something like, ""This is a concert DVD.  It is meant to be listened to with the volume up.""  A great piece of advice, because that is the only way one can truly appreciate the depth of the Cure's musical genius.
Staged in Germany over three nights, it is the entirety of their classic albums ""Pornography,"" ""Disintegration,"" and ""Blood Flowers"" played live in a fluid, linear fashion.  A unique experience in that you have only a few singles and a plethora of deeper album cuts, all of which sound magnificient here.
Smith's angst-ridden lyrics are haunting and poignant, offering the viewer/listener a new depth to these old Cure standbys.  The unrestrained instruments and vocals flow well with the cinematography, and while the Cure has never been considered--to some--a live band, this DVD shatters all conceptions and assumptions, proving that while Robert Smith has aged, his music still withstands the test of time; ""Plainsong,"" ""The Hanging Garden,"" ""Lovesong,"" ""Fascination Street,"" ""Disintegration,"" and ""Bloodflowers"" are classics old and new, played here in a fresh manner that leads one to change their minds about which versions of the albums are preferrable, studio or live.
Visually, it is stunning; with pans to the crowd, the band, and close-ups of Smith and company as well as focuses on the crowd, one has the impression that they are at the concert themselves.  Energetic, bombastic bounding is downplayed by the moodiness of the lyrics, but this only enhances the performance; Smith is no Eddie Vedder or John Mellencamp; his is a quiet energy expressed through his playing.
This is a must-have for any Cure fan and anyone who can appreciate one of the founders of Modern Rock and a great stage show with awesome music.",1067385600,4,1773,5.037542662116041

I think this DVD projects the sound and feeling of this album Robert Smith wanted to share which makes it enjoyable (or depressing, however you see it).  The other two albums sound terrific.  Jason's drums sound better here than on the albums.  If you don't like this DVD you probably don't really like the Cure, go find some U2.",1064880000,,418,4.447368421052632
1880509,3,B000096I9G,"I bought the DVD mainly for the Disintegration Set and the Bloodflowers set.
The Disintegration set is a bit shaky. I think a lot of that is due to Balmonte`s weak guitar playing during the set. The music just doesn`t seem to have that edge and moodiness that I enjoy in a good Cure concert. They seem to be more worried about making mistakes.
The Bloodflowers set I found to be pretty bland, sounding virtually identical to the studio version. Balmonte`s guitar doesn`t sound that good either. It`s not his playing that is bad,it`s the sound of his guitar. His guitar setup is wrong or something.
Although I`m not really a fan of the the Pornography record,the live set on the DVD is the best of the three.
Overall,I found the DVD rather disappointing and a bit boring to be honest.
Maybe they should have brought back some of the previous band members as guests i.e. Boris Williams on drums for the Pornography set and Porl Thompson on guitar for the Disintegration set.
Try and see the DVD first before you decide to buy it.",1064016000,2,1027,4.556756756756757
1880510,5,B000096I9G,"Having been a Cure fan since 1985, this is nothing short of a godsend.  I have seen the Cure live (only) 3 times.. on the kissing tour, the disintegration tour and the wish tour.  I had tickets to the swing tour, but broke my leg just before the show and therefore couldn't attend...  That said, I think what impresses me most about this DVD is how much Robert and the boys have progressed as musicians and as a band.  Robert, Simon, Perry, Roger and Jason play their collective butts off during this set.  Now let's get down to it:
Pornography: To echo most other reviews here, this version of Pornography blows away the original.  The energy here is much more intense.  Jason, i think, does an excellent job of recreating Lol Tolhurst's tribal drumming, and adds some nice fills and touches to update the feel a bit.  Best songs: One Hundred Years (btw, it really impressed me when during the interview Roger said that this brought him to tears the first time he played it live with the band), Siamese Twins, The Figurehead, A Strange Day (one of my all-time favs), and Cold (chilling).
Disintegration: One of their strongest albums played in its entirety.. what more could a Curehead ask for?  Beautiful performances here... I know some people complained about some of the keyboard sounds not being exactly the same, but give the guys a break... I didn't find it to be enough to detract from the incredible performances.  Again, Jason had his work cut out for him, filling the huge drummer-shoes of Boris Williams.  Again, he rises to the occasion nicely.  Roger's piano in Homesick is excellent. Best songs: Last Dance, Fascintation Street, Prayers for Rain, Same Deep Water as You, Disintegreation (nice to see that Robert is actually human, flubbing the words a little), Homesick.
Bloodflowers:  As much as I wanted to really like this CD, I couldn't get into is as much as the earlier ones.  That said, this performance does salvage it some for me.  These songs do work better in a live performance.  The energy is better and the passion is stronger.  The band also seems more comfortable with the songs.  The big surprise to me here was Perry's lead guitar in Watching Me Fall, Bloodflower and other places... while he's no Porl Thompson, he plays with a great deal of emotion.  Robert also seems to sing these songs better live than he did on the CD.  Best Songs: Watching Me Fall, The Loudest Sound, Maybe Someday, 39, Bloodflowers.
The encores are also awesome.  Having seen them perform both of these songs live before, I was not surprised by Robert's lead guitar abilities.
Overall, Robert, Simon, Roger, Perry and Jason put in fine performances.  Minor mix issues (yeah it would be nice to hear Robert's 6 String Bass more) don't take away from it.  The camera work is very tasteful and well done, and the sound itself is very good.
I am also enthusiastic about what is alluded to on the DVD Jacket... the remastering and re-release of all Cure CDs in 2004.  Wow... they've deserved it for a long time now... bonus tracks would be awesome... like the live version of Faith from the Charlotte Sometimes 12 inch, the B-Sides to Head on the Door, etc... I also would love to see The Cure in Orange relased on DVD.  Also, as Robert says he has tons of tapes of live shows, how about releasing some of those as well... I think this band's live performances are greatly overlooked.  Any Cure fan will tell you.. this band (no matter which incarnation) kicks live...  If you're a Cure fan or are Curious about the Cure, you should waste no time and buy this.  Oh, but if you just like the Cure for their light poppy fluff then you may require therapy after this...",1063238400,7,3671,4.632148377125193

His creative fires are sizzling by the time we reach Bloodflowers and just explodes through the encores.  The Kiss has always been one of the Cure's best concert pieces, but this rendition is over the top.

1880513,4,B000096I9G,"First of all, let me say, don't buy this if you want to hear the studio albums while watching the band play them.  Many of the reviews herein say that the songs don't sound the same (the keyboards are different, the drums don't sound right).  This is true and if you are for some reason thinking that any live performance sounds like a studio performance you are horribly mistaken.
However, if you want to hear some of your favourite Cure songs and maybe even gain a different understanding of them by seeing them under a different light (because the vocals are different, the drums are different, etc.), then this is the DVD for you.
I would also like to point out that if you're used to really visually spectacular shows, on the scale of bands like Pink Floyd and Tool, you may find this DVD visually a bore.  I confess that I've only watched about a third of the actual video on this DVD because it bores me.  It's interesting seeing the instruments Robert Smith and the rest use on certain songs but watching them play and sing can become tedious.
Now for the real review.  The music on these two DVDs is absolutely stunning.  My two personal favourite Cure albums are Bloodflowers and Disintegration.  Despite subtle changes in singing and the low volume on the lead guitar in some parts, I like this version of Bloodflowers as much if not more than the studio version (and that's saying a lot).  Disintegration doesn't quite live up to its studio version, but I think after listening to it a few times you will find that it is also amazingly well done.
The true miracle of this DVD duo, however, is the Pornography set.  I really didn't like ""Pornography"" the album much when I bought it.  I found certain songs to be very good, but the album seemed to drag on from song to song.  Not so in this live version.  I truly gained a new appreciation for ""Pornography"" (that sounds kind of funny, doesn't it?).
Bottom line is, if you didn't like one of these three albums but liked the other two, maybe this is the Trilogy for you.  Though the visual element is lacking slightly, the audio is worth it.  Trilogy may have been more appropriate as a three CD set, but since it isn't this is the next best thing.",1061164800,11,2209,4.476309226932669
1880514,4,B000096I9G,"It may look like Liz Taylor and Tommy Lee have started a band together, but it's actually Robert Smith and Simon Gallup refusing to go quietly through their forties.

At first glance, the packaging for the DVD looks like a bootleg - no major label, oddly plain titling, etc.  However, the ""Trilogy"" DVD is actually a Smith-funded and -produced affair.  Now, before you write this off as another ego-fueled solo project in disguise (i.e. ""Mixed Up"", ""Wild Mood Swings"", and ""Wrong Number""), take note that this is quite a good presentation of an interesting concert idea - playing three albums conceived as a trilogy in their entirety before a live arena audience.

The performance is very good, even though the Cure will never be the same since Porl Thompson and (especially) Boris Williams left.  These three albums in particular showcase what a great band this is live and how well their material translates into concert performances.  There will always be a magic about Smith's watery guitars floating over Gallup's muscular yet melodic bass lines.  An occasional drawback on this performance is that the trademark Cure flanged reverb threatens to drown out the notes being played - this is particular noticeable during the ""Pornography"" set.

Visually, the filming (not videotaping) of the show is well done.  Multiple camera angles from all over the arena are mixed in with cut shots from on stage, some of which must have been staged outside of the performance because you never see a cameraman running around (which is nice).  Unfortunately, the director saw it as necessary to digitally play with some of the shots based on the mood of the song, i.e. drop-frame time lapse on up-tempo numbers, blurry/dreamy effects on low-key ones.  It's not too distracting, but it almost seems to be an apology as if the performance itself isn't strong enough to keep your interest.

The trilogy concept is interesting, but it does lead to a pair of drawbacks.  First, there are no surprises in the setlist.  Second, by the time you're into the show, you begin craving songs that you know would be great additions but aren't going to be played, i.e. ""A Forest"", ""Faith"", etc.  Oh well.  The ideal solution would be to get Elektra to release ""In Orange"" and even ""Show"" on DVD as well.  Any serious Cure fan would have to agree that the former is one of the greatest live performance ever recorded.

This DVD is a must for any fan of the band's entire career.  The ""Disintegration"" set would also be an excellent introduction to a neophyte looking to discover one of the best live bands ever.",1060387200,2,2585,4.834090909090909

Typical of any Live album as the sound is often muddled due to the overwhelming chorus coming out of the home theater! You should treat yourself, Cure Fan, to a night with the lights down, sipping your favorite indugence, allowing yourself to be swept away by the truly powerful work contained in this DVD. Robert Smith proves that he is truly an artist and poet. The production is well done, the lighting is exellent, and the only negative is the sound quality in some numbers. Also detracting is the fact that live numbers often are different then the original recording, but if you know the song, you won't care. Robert's voice may be slightly ""off key"" to some ears, but if it is, you just aren't that devoted of a fan. Thank You Robert for this one!",1059609600,3,840,4.391025641025641

The concept of playing three entire albums in a concert setting is somewhat unique and affords fans the opportunity to see and hear songs that they may not otherwise enjoy on the usual ""album selling"" tour.  The performances on this DVD make it evident that the Cure is still a viable and creative band.  We are privy to front row seats, backstage passes, and great sweeping views of the scenery that makes up the atmosphere of a live Cure concert.
The recording is top notch.  If you have a good sound system, this may become your favorite concert DVD.  Most enjoyable, for me, was their amazing performance of ""Disintegration.""  I've always wondered how they would pull that off live, but have never seen it until now.  I think this would be a great video for Cure fans and neophytes alike.

Secondly, I remember 'A Short Term Effect', 'Cold' and 'Disintegration' played faster live, originally. The Pornography set seems to be played slower than the album which takes some doing. I can't see the point of doing a show like this if you're not going to bring something new to the table, a new interpretation, etc. What's the point of a ploddingly faithful rendition of the records on stage at this point? Okay, so it's now a historical document, it's 'on the record' so to speak, but so what? This is about as dynamic as a turtle. Know what a tortoise is? Same thing. Pleasant listening, but it might as well be Pink Floyd. There's an encore of Kiss stuff.

If you have not experienced The Cure live now is a chance to get a feel for how incredible they are live.  After my first Cure concert I was blown away, this DVD recreates that experience.  If you do not own a top notch stero system and an HDTV now you have a reason to get them.  The two encores are reason enough to pick this up.  The first power cords of the Kiss sends chills down your spine.
BTW to those that complain that it doesn't sound like the CD's, I say GREAT!  That is why I love their live stuff so much.  Rob will go off on tagents taking the songs in different directions but always adding something to them.

1880542,5,B000096I9G,"And an update...
MTV reports that ""Seminal goth-pop band the Cure will re-release their first five albums with lots of bonus material in May. Three Imaginary Boys (1979), Boys Don't Cry (1980), Seventeen Seconds (1980), Faith (1981) and Pornography (1982) have all been digitally remastered, and none of the expanded tracks will duplicate songs from their recently released box set, Join the Dots: B-sides and Rarities, 1978-2001. Additional Cure reissues will be released later in the year.""
I've been waiting forever.
Inside the case, it lists that the albums Pornography, Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, Disintegration and Bloodflowers will all be remastered and rereleased in 2004. Since this represents parts of 1982-2000, I can only assume that they are planning a MASSIVE rerelease of absolutely everything in The Cure's back catalog. They were on Elektra in the states...Could that mean that Rhino is doing the reissues? If so, I'm imagining that they will give each album the double disc treatment (as they did with Elvis Costello) and include EVERYTHING!! Here's to hoping for good things in 2004!

Moments frozen in time from three decades. So many of these songs never made it to a traditional tour stage that to hear them now is treat. Interesting too is the older Cure material played by a newer version of the line-up... fascinating.

The performance is straight ahead music... these are my words and they mean something to me! Robert Smith as always is the focal point of the whole concert... and he is older just like the rest of us and a tad heavier too.

The wonderful aspect is that the words, sounds, and songs hold up... the passion and emotion is there on songs 20 years old and songs 2 years old. What a tour de force.

The encore set offers a stand-out rocking performance of ""The Kiss"" and just as the show kicks off with a haunting version of ""100 Years"", ""The Kiss"" sends the viewer/listener on their way with a blow to the mind.... awsome.

The music sounds great and I cannot get enough of it.  My only regret is not seeing them live myself, but this is as close as I would guess it would be.

Although many people have a vague notion of the Cure as a poppy 80's band (Boys Don't Cry, Just Like Heaven) the true musical genius of the band shines on epics like 100 Years and The Same Deep Water As You.  This DVD showcases the darker side of the Cure that has made them legendary.  It contains absolutely stunning complete performances of arguably their 3 best recordings (Pornography, Disintegration and Bloodflowers).

1880548,4,B000096I9G,"Concise, accurate review from a long-time Cure fan who is VERY familiar with their live work:
1)Sound quality - Excellent.
2)Video quality - Average. Very ""VHS-quality,"" and not sharp.
3)Editing quality - Poor.  Whoever assembled this video felt the need to rotate between all 12 camera views as quickly as possible for much of the show.  It's very disorienting, and makes all of the musicians' subtle nuances look like stereotypical posing.
4)Performance quality - Varied.  I have to disagree with the ""official"" review here almost completely.  The Pornography and Bloodflowers performances were the best, overall.
The Disintegration set, on the other hand, suffered from poor tones (Simon's bass tone was too raw and harsh, Robert's Bass VI was very weak in volume and somewhat scratchy, and Roger's keyboards were often not loud enough).  These same problems also affected the 2 encore songs, ""If Only Tonight We Could Sleep"" and ""The Kiss.""
That all being said, this is a worthwhile purchase for any Cure fan, though it may not be the best introduction for those not familiar with the band.  I would recommend the ""Show"" video for someone looking for a more representative (and better filmed) performance.",1055462400,2,1209,5.142857142857143
1880549,5,B000096I9G,"This is the best live release the Cure has ever done, and way up there as concert films go in general.
I was in Berlin for both nights of the filming.  Although the DVD could never capture the ""essense"" of the cigarrete smoke filled room (gasp!), far more detail is revealed in sound and vision on the DVD.
I was very impressed the the filming, particularly some of the side stage shots where Robert, Simon and Perry are all in focus, as well as the editing which really captured the frenetic portions of songs like The Kiss.  Very ocasionally video effects were used, but only on Pornography did I think it was over done.  (Interestingly, although the the huge floor to ceiling projections were integral to the show, the dramatic images are lost since there are very few full stage scenes.)

The sound was pristine, and for once Jason's drum sound had a powerful punch that I feel has been missing on the least few tours.  My only fault with Trilogy is that the audio is so clean that at times it does not sound ""live"".  This opinion is based on the stereo audio track.  Perhaps the 5.1 audio track captures more of the ambience of the venue.",1055462400,,1143,4.466346153846154
1880550,5,B000096I9G,"Not only is this a great Cure concert film, this is one of the best concert films I have ever seen.  The band spared no expense on this release.

1880551,4,B000096I9G,"I bought this DVD solely for the performance of the Pornography album, my and many others' favorite Cure album. The only  disappointment with the performance--and unfortunately it's a major one--is that the drummer plays behind the beat on nearly every song. This gives the impression that the band is constantly running out of steam. For such an intense album, this dragginess saps a lot of power from these songs.
There are two exceptions, though: ""The Figurehead"" which sounds slightly more relaxed and melodic than the album version; and an absolutely amazing performance of ""Cold""--if only the whole set could have been this good!
On the minus side, ""Short Term Effect"" and ""Pornography"" don't come off too well because of the dissonant Arabic guitar lines that never quite match up properly.
Generally, though, everything in the set sounds good but the drumming. In the interview section of the disc the drummer admits being slightly uncomfortable playing these older songs. Going to the Bloodflowers set you can hear how much better he is playing his own parts.
As far as the rest of the DVD is concerned, I enjoyed:
The Interviews, especially Robert's
Stage, Light Show
Simon Gallup's stage presence w/ low slung bass a la Paul Simonon/Peter Hook

1880552,5,B000096I9G,"""The Cure-Trilogy"" is the best concert dvd I have seen and I have quite a few. It feels as if you are there watching the band play(and I must say the light show is dazzling). The ""Pornography"" set, featuring an album from 1982, sounds fresh and powerful. The drums and the bass on several of the songs sound punchy and crisp. There are also little camera effects which add so much to the show. The ""Disintegration"" set has an epic feel, with keyboards coming up front and tons of layered guitar. Many of the songs are emotional and the blue colors of the light show set a mood for the set. The final ""Bloodflowers"" set contains several wistful and beautiful songs as well as a few heavy, energetic songs. The show is definitely The Cure's best I've seen in a live setting. All of the instruments have room to breathe and there is a high amount of dynamics in each song. ""The Cure-Trilogy"" is the best purchase if you are a huge Cure fan. The 3 albums, although dark, are The Cure's best moments in their career. If you are a fan of the darker Cure albums, pick this up. If you are a fan of the happier Cure stuff like ""Friday I'm in Love"" or ""In Between Days"" you should still pick this up to see a different side of this wonderful band.

1880553,4,B000096I9G,"Your response to this DVD will depend almost entirely on your previous feelings about the Cure, particularly the 'dark' albums - Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers.  These discs document a one-off performance of this 'Trilogy' (a post facto descriptor; I don't believe Smith had a trilogy in mind when he recorded Pornography) in its entirety, in chronological order.
That said, the performances and musicianship are top-notch, the camera work is good, and the stage set and lighting are nicely designed and pleasing to the eye. It's clear that a great deal of care went into the performance, recording, and packaging of this document.
Disintegration and Bloodflowers sound very much as they do on the original releases - very fine and moving - with a bit of speed and energy added as a function of live performance.  The Pornography set, however, is a real revelation - driven, aggressive versions of a well-written song cycle that was abjectly performed and produced on the original studio release.
If you like early Cure, but have grown aurally discriminating enough to cringe at the stodgy production of their earlier work, this disc will open your ears to the truly excellent songcraft buried in the mix, particularly on Pornography.  I believe this will become the 'definitive' version of Pornography, finally performed and recorded in the manner its creators intended.
The extras are fine, but for the die-hard fan only, I suppose.  I could only watch so much interview footage featuring the various band members mumbling about the performance.  Robert Smith is kind of articulate and funny in certain spots, though.",1055289600,9,1634,5.197718631178708

That should be this weekend!!) What I've heard so far is stunning, not only in sound but in picture as well (and thankfully, the film is in 1:85 widescreen!) What I think I like most, though, is finally hearing ""Pornography"" with the lush, full-band sound it deserves - no drum machines or tinny production - putting it on a level with any of the band's later material. Of course, every bit of ""Disintegration"" is simply majestic - I didn't know whether I felt like crying or taking a shit, it moved me so much! ""Bloodflowers"" - well, what can I say?? If you're a ""true"" Cure fan (i.e., one who knows that these are their three best albums - well, ok, I gotta say I love ""Wish"" as much as these three), then you've gotta have this.

1880555,5,B000096I9G,"The Cure ""Trilogy"" live in Berlin is an unprecedented document of one of the most prolific and critically acclaimed bands in the history of popular music.
""Trilogy"" captures The Cure's performance of their landmark albums Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers, in their entirety. For those who are familiar with commercially-released Cure videos, ""Trilogy"" is comparably the epitome of The Cure's sheer genius. A brilliant light show, outstanding cinematography, and unparalleled sound quality effectively convey the melancholy and chaotic vision of Robert Smith as never before. The Cure's performance is alternately intense and subdued: Robert's vocals are consistently stunning, while subtle variations in musical arrangements breathe new life into familiar songs, rendering every performance superior to the album version while maintaining the essence of the original. Perry Bamonte's guitar work is particularly tasteful during the Bloodflowers set, while Simon Gallup's bass provides possibly the only semblance of cohesion during the near-schizophrenic Pornography set. Jason and Roger are once again acutely proficient at drums and keyboards, repsectively.
Highlights of the Pornography set include unbelievable renditions of ""A Short Term Effect,"" ""The Figurehead,"" and ""Cold."" The Disintegration set is simply mind-blowing. Note the return of the original synth to ""Pictures of You,"" as well as haunting versions of ""Last Dance"" and ""Distintegration.""
""Fascination Street"" and ""Prayers for Rain"" have never sounded better. Bloodflowers songs are even more concise and emotional than Dream Tour performances: standouts include ""Watching Me Fall,"" ""The Last Day of Summer,"" and a surprisingly improved ""39.""
The inclusion of encore ""The Kiss"" is a wonderful asset to the set and a fitting end to the DVD. Even long-established Cure fans will be shocked by the intensity of ""The Kiss;"" I have heard many, many live versions and this one...WOW. Worth the price of the DVD for this performance alone.
The Cure ""Trilogy"" DVD is a phenomenal testament to art-in-progress. The performance is timeless and classic, yet strangely contemporary. This DVD is a mere facet of The Cure's extensive catalog of music and is representative of Robert Smith's most ethereal, introspective work...casual fans would benefit from becoming familiar with less-demanding albums before watching ""Trilogy"" from start to finish (Cure Show might be a good place to start as far as concert footage.) ""Trilogy"" is a brilliant, unparalleled perforance...The Cure are successful in making three inherently dark albums sound, well...a whole lot darker. 10 stars.",1055203200,5,2645,5.75

Some of the songs are amazing...Plainsong is just awesome.... 100 Years is Amazing....  and the entire Bloodflowers set is just like I remember in 2000.
The Bad:  Some of your and MY favorite songs are performed off key...yes I said it..off key... particularly ""Closedown.""  This is my fav Cure song, and yet the keyboard sample is wrong....it is not even close to the original nor does it sound good.  To me that is tragic.....tragic .... I had waited so long to see it live only to be disappointed.  I can't imagine why Smith allowed this to go unedited.
6-string problems... the haunting sound of Rob's 6 string has been toned down and muffled throughout...why? I don't know...another strange decision by the band I suppose.  If you want to hear it best, get ""Show"".

I haven't even finished watching all of it, but i have to stay that i'm pretty impressed with most of it already. All the albums are faithfully performed and each performance is pretty close to the full album length, so there aren't any experimentation (and fortunately, no edits). I don't know if it was the film or the filmer, but this is a much more satisfying release than the live performance from their Wish tour. That one just seemed too ""produced"" (if that makes any sense) and didn't really seem ""live"" (compared to, say, U2's Zoo TV video, which looks like a tv performance but feels like a live performance, with no overdubbing, etc.....)and basically, ""bloated."" The band played really well, and i think i can finally appreciate Simon on Bass, seeing as how i can finally hear him (cheers to whoever mixed the sound). The final encore of the two Kiss Me tracks are also very well played, with the band ""rocking out"" on The Kiss. I probably would have also enjoyed ""jupiter crash, faith, primary, push,"" but i guess they needed some downbeat tracks to fit in with the rest of the set.  Also, there isn't any interaction between the band and the audience (which i suppose isn't really strange, but you'd think that during those three hours Robert would have something more to say than ""thank you."" So if you're a Cure fan, you probably already have this, but if not, go get it.

Don't get me wrong The Cure is very entertaining, but I enjoy The Cure in Orange and Show much better then this one. He seemed to have less energy onstage in Trilogy. But over all I think it is great if you are a die-hard Cure fan. I do love them, but not this DVD. This is just my honest opinion!!",1055030400,,481,3.8686868686868685
1880559,5,B000096I9G,"Wow, now you talk about a concert.... I love it!! I just recently bought ""In Orange"" as well, but there's something about this concert that has you hooked and constantly wanting to re-watch it. It's been months since I first heard about the ""possible"" release of a recent Cure concert that was filmed in Berlin. It's so hard not think that at that time it was only a thought, or an idea. I bought it the day after it came out last week, and let me tell you it is totally worth the money. One surprise is that it's a 2 disc concert, with hours of enjoyment (roughly 4 hours), but if you're a big fan like me then you'll absolutley love sitting and staring while you're passing the evening away.
  It opens with of course the ""Pornography"" set, a massive crowd of German fans wait for the opening song then almost out of nowhere Robert comes out and EVERYONE goes insane. They play the hell out of these songs, breathing new life into these early 80's classics. It's very intresting to see how well Jason can master the hard drum parts Boris used to play with such ease. Also on the 1st disc is the ""Disintegration"" set, and of course they go in order on the albums. Plainsong always gave me chills and it still does in concert. These songs have obviously stood the test of time.
  I'd have to say my favorite part would be ""Bloodflowers"", on disc 2. Especially how they played ""The Loudest Sound"", it's just so intense and emotional. My favorite part of that song is of course the guitar solo Robert plays. His facial expressions in that particular song are so strong and sincere and it made me want to cry. I always wondered what that song would sound like live. The entire conert is like nothing else.. Just to see how the band has evolved over these last 25 years is amazing. It seems as if every passing year they get more intense and become much deeper. And I believe that is very noticable in this concert. This is a must have for any Cure fan, this shouldn't be passed up. I know that I'm happy I own it. For everyone out there, I think it's safe to say that there WILL be another Cure album coming up here real soon... I say this because I watched the interview section and Robert mentioned what their new projects will be like. I was extremly excited to hear this, so there's some good news to look forward to.
  The show ends with an encore of 2 songs off of ""Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me""... ""If only tonight we could sleep"" and ""The Kiss"". I personally thought that this was a real intresting way to end a concert, mainly because their both from different albums but I still feel like they have the same emotion. It's a real neat twist I think.... Following the encore is a pretty long interview with every member from the band.
  Once again, I strongly urge new and old Cure fans alike to purchase this wonderful concert. You honestly won't be disappointed, there's something for everyone to enjoy while watching this. And by the way, I'm not just telling everyone to 'go and buy it because I'm a fan'.. My Dad sat and watched quite a bit of it with me and he commented on how ""that's a hell of a band"". And he's barely even heard of them!! To say the least he was stunned by their talent. So dammit, even if you AREN'T a Cure fan, buy it anyway!! Discover this wonderful band!!  It's a great concert and who doesn't love watching hard-working, gifted and talented musicians?!! Who knows, you just might become a fan!!",1055030400,,3425,4.364207221350078

7989952,4,B000096I9G,It is a well done concert for dvd. I don't know why I bought this other then it was a good deal because I have not followed or heard much from this 80's band. I am glad I chanced it as I did like it. I especially like the guitar playing and lights but not so much the whiney vocals.,1522368000,,282,3.716666666666667
