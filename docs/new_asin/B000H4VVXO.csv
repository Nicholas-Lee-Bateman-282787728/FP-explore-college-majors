8136273,5,B000H4VVXO,This is the only instructional video I could ever find like it.  I actually know the Acupuncture Physician who made it.  I am SO glad she did. I've been doing this for about 4 years - off and on - and no body can believe I'm 56 yrs old.  I use Vitamin D*E oil or Siberian Pine Nut oil and follow up the video routine with deep tissue massage.  MUCH cheaper than fancy wrinkle creams in department stores.,1456531200,2,404,4.141025641025641
8136274,3,B000H4VVXO,"I was really looking forward to this disc and when I watched it, all she did was show you the acupressure movements and points, but not how many times to exercise these spots at any one time when doing the facial.  I purchased another disc and the person in that disc did show you the movements, points and how many times to exercise those points when giving yourself that facial. The other disc I purchased was: The Chinese Acupressure Facelift.",1388707200,5,446,4.575
8136275,5,B000H4VVXO,"I liked the DVD. It was very clear and direct.
I was wondering if it was based on something I already knew and it was!
I had pretty much learned the technique already from a book I had a long time ago but it was nice to see it done live.
I would recommend it.",1388448000,,259,3.727272727272727
8136276,5,B000H4VVXO,"This if a truly wonderful alternative to expensive procedures.
I perform each of them while soaking in sauna!  They are just that easy to learn and implement.",1188086400,9,158,4.851851851851852
