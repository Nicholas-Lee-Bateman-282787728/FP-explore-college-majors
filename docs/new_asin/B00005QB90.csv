7950049,4,B00005QB90,The movie arrived on time.  It was a very good blu-ray copy.  I remember watching this movie back in the day and I enjoyed watching it again.,1492473600,,141,4.185185185185185
7950050,5,B00005QB90,"Look our Road Warrior, you have a major rival in Rebecca Holden.  Rebecca steals this film about a wrecked Earth in the future.  It is entertaining without trying to be super serious with lessons about a dying planet.  There is an implied message at the end and some fantasy effects throughout the action, however that only adds to the story.  Do check the rating as it is not for all ages due to violence and partial nudity in one scene.",1255478400,2,438,4.4375
