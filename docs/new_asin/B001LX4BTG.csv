8320115,3,B001LX4BTG,"I was a little disappointed with this video. I was hoping for a video that focused on the bombers themselves, you know, film of the interior, specifications, model upgrades, first hand accounts and so on. Instead, this video deals with German bomber strategy, air war history, Goering, etc. For example, the first part of the video goes into great detail about the destruction of Guernica by the Germans during the Spanish Civil War: the number of civilians killed, how they were strafed and bombed from the air, the destruction of their town, etc. Interesting, but not focused on German bombers!

An OK video, but not quite what I was expecting.",1319500800,5,646,4.872727272727273
