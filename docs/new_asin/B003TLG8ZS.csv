  The movie is a good hour long experience to quench a little horror thirst.  About a outcast girl (Tara) at college that gets abducted, thrown into a basement by some wacko satanic parents that have lost their son to fulfill an ancient pact with the forces of darkness to  bring their son back to mortal life.  It takes 12 sacrifices one for each year on the sons birthday and this girl (Tara) is the last.  However she develops a relationship with the boy that is trying to b e resurrected and the parents plan goes awry, as he turns out to be a better negotiator with the powers of darkness than his parents were.

  I thought this movie did quite well being only an hour in length.  The movie did appear pretty dark at times and it was hard to make out what was happening. Though I suppose that would be true to story being most of the movie takes place in a dark basement, so that part cant really be faulted.

  I did think that another girl should have been casted, or the actress that was casted needed more makeup to appear ""Not so pretty"", because it did not lend well to the ""Outcast girl that no one really liked"" type of look, because she was indeed pretty and probably would not have been the outcast girl in real life.  Still though the actress did extremely well given her part. A good buy for your horror collection.",1296172800,,1361,4.366533864541832
