8759519,5,B01ET3105W,"This is a German film, with English subtitles, not so much about the assassination of Austria's Archduke (which sparked WW I), as it is about the investigation of the assassination. In fact, we don't see the assassination in the film. At any rate, an investigator has been charged with investigating  the assassination and the men behind it, which he begins to do. Right from the beginning, he smells a rat. The Archduke had been warned not to go, that it was dangerous because of Serbian terrorists. The city route through which he is to pass has been published in the newspapers. The Archduke and his wife travel through the city with no escort. The driver takes a wrong turn and just happens to stop right in front of the assassin. As the investigator is pursuing leads he is under constant, enormous, pressure to write up and sign the conclusions, all the while becoming aware that preparations have begun for Austria to go to war with Serbia.

Now, how historically correct is this film? That's the question. I have no idea whether the investigator/investigation is accurate, but the suspicious circumstances regarding the assassination are, indeed, accurate. One small mistake in the film is that everyone in the film seems to know about the alliances between the European powers, whereas in reality the treaties were secret.

The acting, plot, direction and costumes were superb.",1486944000,7,1386,4.9655172413793105
