4388557,4,B004ISWRGK,"This is a good movie, not as good as the original one. It still shows the level of corruption and society behavior in Rio/Brazil.",1307836800,,129,4.416666666666667
4388558,5,B004ISWRGK,"if your a fan of the first one, you must watch this one, not a sequel made just to cash in on the success of the first one. a warning though, this version doesnt even have english subtitles, so if you don't know portuguese don't bother with this one yet.",1307836800,10,254,4.1
4388559,5,B004ISWRGK,Don't be afraid to get both Elite Squad movies just because they don't come from Hollywood. These movies are one of the best you'll ever watch. Worth every penny.,1297468800,17,162,4.620689655172414
4388560,5,B004ISWRGK,"To those who wants to understand how a rich country like Brazil is still apparently too poor, I recommend this movie. In this movie Capito Nascimento (Captain Nascimento) discovers that the city of Rio de Janeiro is surrounded by criminals that are incorporated everywhere. His utopia that he could clean the city of traffic, etc., is faded way when he discovers that politicians, policy are in all parts of the caos in Rio de Janeiro.

If you have plans to understand the dark side of the Land of wonders (terra maravilhosa) this movie is recommended. However, if you want to understand the story altogether buy Elite Squad 1 (English Version) and hopefully you will have Elite Squad 2 in English sooner.

Remember, there is no English Version for while, but Steve Spielberg (I heard) is about to edite here.

Good luck",1296518400,7,820,4.801418439716312

8431259,1,B004ISWRGK,"Box states subtitles in English and Portuguese, but this is not true. Subtitles exist in Spanish only. Beware if you are not fluent in Portuguese or Spanish.",1391990400,,157,4.851851851851852
8431260,5,B004ISWRGK,"Extraordinary jump into the complexity of Rio's Narco Squads. Trumps the first one in the series, even though that one was really good too.  The screenplay was written by the same guy who wrote, ""City of God""...which, if you don't know about? GO SEE.",1385078400,,250,4.681818181818182
8431261,3,B004ISWRGK,"I love all of the TROPA DE ELITE films. They are sexy, villainous, and riveting. I will continue to purchase these movies as long as they keep getting produced and generated. Wonderful action flick!",1384560000,,198,4.852941176470588
8431262,5,B004ISWRGK,"Last night my wife and I watched TROPA DE ELITE II (ELITE FORCE II), one of the political/corruption best feature films I've seen since Z, and the more recent Russell Crowe, and Al Pacino fantastic THE INSIDER.

Director Jose Padilla now directing ROBOCOP is brilliant. This film is even better than TROPA DE ELITE I which was also outstanding.

Hopefully, visionary Brazilian filmmaker Padilla isn't dazzled nor corrupted by the Hollywood studio system that will use him, and then discard him. ROBOCOP is already a step down, though he will probably be paid enough to make several great Brazilian films, real cinema, once he's finished here (one or two films that don't make money) as happened to Walter Salles who directed MOTORCYCLE DIARIES among his other credits, and CIDADE DE DEUS (CITY OF GOD) director Fernando Meirelles (co-directed by Katia Lund).

Though it deals with violent Brazilian political corruption, while we don't kill people wholesale as depicted re Rio de Janiero, our government is no lamb lost in the woods as we've seen with the recent Benghazi cover-up and outright lies which helped criminal Muslim ass kissing Wall Street puppet on a string Obama get re-elected for his second term.

It's a must see film, even with subtitles that us lazy Americans (including myself) hate to read.

Ironically, this amazing film wasn't released theatrically unlike all the comic book CGI trash in theaters now.",1374969600,,1424,5.068376068376068
8431263,5,B004ISWRGK,This is a phenomenal movie.  Better than pretty much anything put out by Hollywood these days.  I can't wait to see what this director does next.,1325721600,,145,4.538461538461538
8431264,5,B004ISWRGK,"After a perfect and exciting Elite Squad -the first one- came this sequel.
As a movie is as good as the prequel, no doubt about it. But as a sequel is a different way to get it.
This movie is about how corrupt may the political systems be, how the ways to keep on control are so despicable and inhuman. How good men can be used to maintain the lords of a community.

The bad thing about this movie es that I could not swallow it as a sequel, it deserved a new context, new characters.

I'd never forget Matias was cowardly killed, and I somehow I expected to see again an elite squad doing some action... yeah, lots of it, but not precisely from these men in black.

Good, very good movie... but I ended up with a sense of losing some loved things.",1325289600,,748,4.144827586206897
