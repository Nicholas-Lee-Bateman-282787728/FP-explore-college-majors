7827112,3,6302492823,"This is without a doubt the DUMBEST MOVIE I have ever seen.  Only a gun control freak could like this movie.  It is about a woman whose husband gives her a gun for the house.  She starts off being scared of a HUNK OF METAL.  She doesn't learn how to use it or the safety rules.  OMG. Two thugs break in the house (she has babies upstairs asleep) and first they threated to rape her, and then if she isn't accepting that, they will go upstairs and do ""harm"" to her babies!  She finally before too much damage, gets to the GUN AND SHOOTS ONE OF THEM. The other ner-do-good, escapes!  She is so terrified that she has SHOT THIS THUG!  Never mind he threatened to rape her and Lord only knows what they WOULD HAVE DONE to her children.  Then she trashes the NRA when they ask her to tell her story as a person that indeed SAVED HER FAMILY because she had the gun.  Having two little girls of my own at the time of the movie (not that time would change my opinion) I would have shot them without hesitation and never lost a wink of sleep.  The only people that really would think the story is other that just stupid, are avid GUN CONTROL FANATICS.  Thank heavens there aren't that many of them.  If you want to laugh, agreed this is an interesting story, and true, I never have forgotten it. So I have to give it, for being a tv movie an ""It's okay""  but a SiFi movie would be more BELIEVABLE!  What parent would protect their children and then feel BAD about it.  COME ON, REALLY!",1462233600,,1476,4.180851063829787

7827115,5,6302492823,This movie is just as tense now as it was when I was younger.  It is in good condition & I received it sooner than expected.  Love it!,1384300800,,134,3.75
7827116,3,6302492823,"Good old movie that you don't forget. Wes Craven certainly saw this before he filmed the 1984 Classic movie about his character Freddy Kruger .I almost believe its the same house even,and When you see the end you will know what I am talking about.",1381190400,,247,4.511111111111111
7827117,5,6302492823,"This movie had good actors and it should show everyone in this day and time with so many home invasions, that you need to learn how to protect yourself. Better safe than sorry!",1376784000,,176,4.363636363636363
7827118,5,6302492823,Great Movie!! I got it cause i'd been wanting to watch it. Sally Struthers played an awesome role in movie.,1326153600,,107,4.4
7827119,5,6302492823,"Should be more than five stars!!!... While this movie did not receive wide acclaim, it struck me when as a 12-year old so many years ago how incredibly dramatic and versitile Sally Struthers was as an actress.  Up to that point the only thing that I'd seen her in was ""All In The Family"" and then there was this movie; totally blew me away.  I don't have a copy of it, yet, but I'm in search of one, and once I find it, I'll never let it go.  It's one of those classic's that belongs right up there with ""Gone With The Wind"", ""Auntie Mame"", ""Imitations of Life"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate""",1046822400,5,592,4.267857142857143
