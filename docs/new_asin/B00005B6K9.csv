7936708,4,B00005B6K9,"'s worth it just for the ""Bob's Birthday""!  Bob and Margaret were  a British cartoon that was so wonderfully quirky and ridiculous I LOVED it.  Even the dog is more awesome than Brian of Family Guy Game.

I will say, I did not order my dvd from Amazon...someone had given me a gift card to the, ahem, competitor.  I have a kindle and do all my shopping via Amazon, so I was like ""and what do I do with this?""  So I found the dvd at the competitor and purchased it at the FULL  PRICE OF $25.  Then I see Amazon has it for about $7.  HOLY CRAP!  No wonder the competition is in SERIOUS trouble.",1404000000,,592,4.025862068965517
