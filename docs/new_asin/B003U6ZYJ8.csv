You took a very real situation , in real time and it is BEAUTIFUL!. In your film the content represented a life I have lead. I was that foster child who was left behind from a drug addicted mother. I was that single mom working to raise three boys, and I am that parent who had to leave the streets behind and keep it moving.....for my children! Realizing that I wanted better for my children gave me that push to do better, and here I am. I try to instill understanding in my young men that life is what you make it. It can indeed be hard and a constant struggle, but if you put your best foot forward the best WILL come. I want to show the film to my young men so they can see MR.NEX and his delima with the baby momma drama & child support , and I want my little brother to see the dad who stepped up for the sake of his children, and I want the world to see the gentleman who spoke of stopping those chiildren on the streets with their pants hanging down and talking to them. Your film inspired me as an educational professional and as a mother.",1279065600,,1283,4.095238095238095
