8595858,5,B00DPH7T0E,"First titled Gatchaman '94, this 3-episodes OVA series was a 90s remake of the original 1970s TV series. Key animator Yasuomi Umetsu, who created Kite and Mezzo Forte, had also worked on two other remakes of Tatsunoko series, Hurricane Polymore and Casshern. This was slightly edgier, and war more fan service-y adaptation of the original ""five teenagers with attitude""!

Set in the mid-21st Century, a rising nation creates its own world power, but is secretly a front for the alien invasion force known as the Galactor, lead by the gender-bewildering Solaris. To counter this, the UN sends out their science ninja team, Gatchaman, a quintet of costumed teens who can take on entire armies and giant mechas with their superior weapons and tech. Their stellar ship the Phoenix can even turn into a giant fiery bird that can plow through nearly anything. The battle is on between super-heroic bird-themed ninjas and aliens in mod-ugly uniforms.

Gatchaman was first put on VHS and DVD by the now defunct Urban Vision, but was recently re-released by Sentai Filmworks, along with most of the other Gatchaman titles, most of which have brand new dubs to them. If you'd like a streamlined version of the first season of the 70s TV series with some lightning-quick action, then this is sure to please any fan of Marvel Comics!",1492646400,2,1321,4.9192825112107625
