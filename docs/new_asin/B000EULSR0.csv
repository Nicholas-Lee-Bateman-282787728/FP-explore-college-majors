2535136,5,B000EULSR0,"Yes, Deadwood may have extensive profanity, and some graphic sex, but guess what, that's how the real Deadwood was! Deadwood was an illegal settlement in the Black Hills territory made up of mostly gruff miners, and people who wanted to profit from them. These men weren't polite, friendly, or even hospitable. They DID curse ever other word, because that was the vernacular of the uneducated pioneer. As far as graphic sex, women in deadwood at that time were mostly prostitutes or dancing girls. it was not a place for polite young society women.

There have been a lot of western TV series, but this is by far the best, and probably the most accurate.

The acting is superb, especially from Ian Mcshane, Timothy Olyphant, and Powers Boothe. They really bring life into their characters. The shows blends the real-life people and fictional characters well. It's a believable hybrid. The sets are superb, and they really give the feel of a true pioneer town.

So, if you're looking for one of the best shows on TV, and you love westerns(especially historically acurate ones), you'll love Deadwood.",1146096000,14,1098,4.924324324324324
2535137,1,B000EULSR0,"The overuse of profanity and sexual scenes really detracts from what Deadwood could really be.  It's too bad that it has to sell itself to sex and profanity starved people in order to survive.

For Example, ""High Noon"" starring Gary Cooper is the best western ever made and it has not sex or profanity, just great acting, a great story and great music.  I would recommend that people avoid this series like the plague until the writers and produces stop relying on the aformention central theme of how cool non-stop profanity sound in someone's living room.

2535138,5,B000EULSR0,"As with my review of the first season (which can be seen by clicking ""See all my reviews"" directly above this) I'm not going to comment on the acting, the story or anything of that sort.  Again, I gave it a five star rating, and that should imply my opinion well enough.

This time around I want to comment on the delay of the DVD release and the price of the set.

The delay, while unfortunate, is actually a good thing.  The third season of Deadwood was originally set to air concurrently with the sixth season of The Sopranos.  However, after HBO executives saw the first half of the third season, they felt the show had sufficient strength to not need to piggyback on the ratings of The Sopranos.  So Deadwood and Big Love switched time slots, with Deadwood moving to this summer.  So Deadwood is no longer The Sopranos' little brother.  This shows the confidence that HBO has in the show, and that means the show isn't going away any time soon.

As for the price of the set, keep in mind that HBO is a subscription based network -- meaning they don't make any money from advertising or product placement, which is what pays for most programming on network television (thus the need to charge more than other networks for the DVD releases of their shows).

HBO has something like 25-50 million subscribers, I believe, so most of the country hasn't seen a single episode of the season when it comes out on DVD.  Compare that to shows like Law & Order, 24, and Desperate Housewives which are free to anyone with a TV, so anyone interested in those shows has probably already seen at least half of the season by the time the DVD comes out.

I don't know specific numbers for Deadwood, or any of the other shows that I mentioned, but I do know that HBO spent approximately $4 million per episode of Carnivale, which, while a great show, never had anywhere near the popularity that Deadwood has.

So, yes, the set costs a bit of money.  And, yes, we did have to wait a little longer for the set than most of us would have liked.  But any comments about greed are unfounded.",1144627200,52,2072,4.430079155672823
2535139,5,B000EULSR0,"Unparalleled writing, set design, costume and acting make Deadwood the greatest show on television currently and one of the best in history. Well fleshed out characters and multiple intertwining plot lines leave you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next. Deadwood as a series is nothing less than genius and I can not wait until season three starts in June. Highly recommended.",1144454400,12,397,4.940298507462686
2535140,5,B000EULSR0,"Deadwood is one of my favorite shows to watch because it has the most interesting characters. Ian McShane is great as Al Swearengen, the owner of the Gem Saloon. Deadwood is a great show because the whole idea of seeing what one of the towns on the Sioux territories would behave with very little law enforcement. It is one of the most accurate historical shows I have ever watched and even though there is a lot of profanity, it is still great. What I love about Deadwood is that you can really see how much the characters have changed from episode one to episode twelve of this season. It stinks that there are only twelve episodes but they are better than most twenty-two episode shows.

If you are familiar with the way HBO makes their series, then Deadwood may be the right show for you. It may be the best HBO drama ever and it has one of the best casts of any show on TV now. I highly recommend this season of Deadwood it is even better than the first.",1142640000,50,959,4.298342541436464
2535141,5,B000EULSR0,"BUT!!!!!!!!There is NO reason that Season 1 or 2 wasn't out on DVD in time for Christmas. Now, moving it from March to June really makes me mad. Ive waited long enough for Season 3. To issue Season 2 a week before Season 3 starts is also nonsense. Get with the Program, HBO. WE WANT DEADWOOD ON DVD WITHIN 2 MONTHS of the Seasons ending!!!!!!!! I'll buy the Chinese Bootlegs off ebay, before I wait another year for the previous seasons release next time.",1142553600,19,455,4.428571428571429
2535142,5,B000EULSR0,"Despite a barrage of profanity in every episode, the script of Deadwood represents the best writing in television bar-none.  The characters are brilliantly developed by the show's writer, David Milch (of Hill Street Blues fame).  I eagerly await the third season's debut in June, but will also add the 2nd season DVD to my collection (which already includes Season 1) as soon as it is released in May.  This show is a masterful combination of fact-based drama(ableit not a ""true story""), and brilliant acting from the cast including Ian McShane, Powers Boothe, William Sanderson, W. Earl Brown, and others.  As you watch this show for the first time, be reminded the profanity is there to add authenticity from the period.  In my opinion, Deadwood is one of the best series ever created for television.  Enjoy!",1142208000,16,810,4.962962962962963
2535143,5,B000EULSR0,"The 2nd Season is just as good in many ways with the 1st Season (and that says alot because the first season of Deadwood was absolutly the best. Finally the season 2 boxset will be out in time for the June 2006 Premier of 12 new Deadwood Season 3 Episodes on HBO.The first two Episodes of the set ""A Lie Agreed Upon , Part 1 & 2. Were probley the two best episodes of the season but still everyone is great. The Show is HBO's lifeline now considering in 2007 The Sopranos will be gone and By then HBO will have lost their last highest rated series (Losing Sex and The City & then in 2005 losing Six Feet Under)They are supporting Deadwood so much that they already started a 4th Season to air on HBO in 2007or2008. Dont miss Deadwood Season 2 on DVD its just as great as Season 1 and if you don't have Season 1 you are crazy not too.

2535145,5,B000EULSR0,"Deadwood is perhaps the best show HBO has made, and that's saying something. There is no other TV show, barring perhaps 'The Wire', which is written with such a keen ear for dialogue and with such fleshed out characters. Season 2 is just as good, if not better, than the first series. It moves with slightly more pace and some of the more interesting characters, such as Cy Tolliver and Alma Garrett, are explored in greater depth. Tolliver - played by the incredible Powers Boothe - truly becomes a force to be reckoned with in this second series. The powerplays between him and Al Swearengen make for some of the most interesting television one could hope to see.

Among other things, we see in season two the return of Bullock's wife and son; the softer side of Al Swearengen; a sadistic geologist with a keen eye for gold; and blood-letting between Mr. Wu and a chinese rival from San Francisco. Throughout, we are treated to a healthy dose of Deadwood's trademark violence and profanity, the latter of which rolls of the tongue with surprising eloquence. Swearengen makes certain curse words sound as if they are as natural as 'if', 'and' or 'but'.

Ultimately, the most outstanding features of this series are the following:

1) Al Swearengen - again, as in the first series, Ian McShane is amazing.

2) Cy Tolliver - Powers Boothe devours every scene he's in.

3) Seth Bullock - Timothy Olyphant's sheriff walks the streets of Deadwood like a cauldron about to teem with furious anger. The addition of his wife and son, and his illicit affair with Alma Garrett, add further tension.

Pick up series two when it comes out. Strangely, it's already out here in Australia!",1141862400,121,1675,4.738831615120275

Unfortunately the screen writers blew it by adding way too much histrionic bulk in the development of subordinate characters such as E.B. Farnham.

I find it fascinating to see one way in that territories may have become annexed and later granted statehood.  Justice was more prevalent than ""law.""  If an act was moral and just it was acceptable.  Today our judicial systems unfortunately are more concerned about what is ""legal.""

Deadwood was one  of the best cable westerns ever made. Great characters, interesting storylines and a real authenticity (except for the dialog which takes getting used to) to what life must have been like back in those days. Ian McShane steals the show as the villain you love to hate (but never completely)  and who yet in his own gruff manner sometimes displays uncharacteristic kindness.

2535530,4,B000EULSR0,"My husband and I recently finished a cross country driving trip and one of our stops was Deadwood, SD. After learning from other travelers that the HBO series was based on this historic city, I knew I had to watch the series. Needless to say, I was thrilled that the entire 3 seasons were available on Amazon Prime and free! I have finished all of seasons 1 and 2 and I'm starting 3. I am truly enjoying binge watching episodes. According to our guides in Deadwood, several of the characters and some of the locations that have survived the fires are actual historic figures and places. They have taken some artistic license with the story lines, but I can see where they might have needed to do that to move the story forward and not have to introduce new characters to incorporate some of the history. It is by no means historically accurate. It does show the viewer how challenging life was then--virtually no laws, and you would have been at the mercy of whomever had the money and power. The language is raw for anyone who does not like that sort of thing, and I have wondered if they really used the f-bomb back then as much as they do in the series. Take the time to look up the major figures. Deadwood has a web page which will nicely round our your viewing. Worth your time to watch this series.",1485129600,2,1304,4.392561983471074

The story and character development progress and although I have a hard time believing the reality of the brutality of the frontier (simply kill everyone who crosses you?  We would have never settled the west as everyone would be dead), the story is typical HBO production quality great.

Also, the language they speak is very strange to me and I would be interested in knowing if that is really the way they talked.  Like bible talk or Shakespeare talk.

Like a pack of dogs seeking an alpha leader, everyone finds a position of subservience in a predatory, exploitive, angry male social order. Woman either marry, or live a destitute life.

2535728,4,B000EULSR0,"Loved the series even though it was filmed over 10 years ago. It was interesting to see how many of the characters were in fact based on real life people. Of course there were some fictional characters to play out the story lines for interest, but the entire series was well worth watching. I think the series may give you a bit of the flavor of the lawless west that wasn't as glamorous as portrayed by the old westerns that filled television when I was young",1484265600,,460,4.3604651162790695

2535730,4,B000EULSR0,"I finally gave a thought about the series ""DEADWOOD"" after watching Season 1, Season 2, and Season 3.  It was all about a collection of people back in the middle 1870s that owned business, as foul as they were, in Deadwood, South Dakota, I think.  When you say a program was lusty, with colorful language, that wouldn't exactly fit what I have been watching.  Nudity, including full frontal, cussin' like you haven't heard since the last time the ships were in, and the Sailors started drinkin'.  Having the ""women of the night"" in every episode, along with the killin, doesn't exactly make it an enjoyable series, but I must admit, even though I advised myself not to watch it, I watched each and every episode, from Season 1 through Season 3, and it did get better as the series continued.  I understand there are other Seasons available through Home Box Office, and maybe by the end, it would have some redeeming values to write about.  Probably not much worse than a real-life Cowboy picture in the 60s.",1484265600,,1007,4.661016949152542

2535732,4,B000EULSR0,Great follow-up to season 1.  Good acting and more interesting characters. Storyline was just as captivating as season 1.  Didn't care for the ending.  Seemed to need a season 3 to finish the story.,1484179200,,198,4.764705882352941

I don't know what the producers of these shows think that we the people would enjoy such language and a man with a erecting come busting thru the door, I'm glad none of my kids were around to see that, so to the producers stop with your inmoral ways in Hollywood. I guess it's true you clowns are part of the illuminati. And you think this is what America is bowing to your beliefs is so wrong.

It's almost pornographic in some scenes!  99% of the profanity only detracts from the story line  and definitely added confusion.",1483315200,,423,5.072463768115942

They characters must all be related, all of them Swearingtons.

We suspect an overworked inside joke, since the entire show is anachronistically profane in that nearly every other word begins with an f and ends with a g. It matters little if a noun, adjective, adverb or whatever is needed, or if the speaker is young, old, male, female- they each and all swear as if there were no other words on earth.

2536281,3,B000EULSR0,Must have for deadwood collection. I loved all the seasons however the HBO series was cut short and they never completed it beyond the 3rd season. It just leaves you hanging.

2536326,3,B000EULSR0,"First the ludicrous overuse of the f-word becomes almost humorous to see them fit in this word, seriously, every few words. Is this an accurate depiction of the way people talked then? I hated that part. Was HBO going for historical accuracy? The costuming and everpresent grime was real.
Timothy Olyphant was good but sometimes his dearth of dialogue was ridiculous. Loved him in Justified, though. Kind of his more modern Deadwood character but with much more life.
Writing at times was awful depending on that particular writer of that episode.
Midly interesting storyline, accuracy with Wild Bill Hickok, annoying over acting by Calamity Jane actress.",1479513600,,655,5.188679245283019

2536413,4,B000EULSR0,"This is my go to show when I exercise in the morning. It has a number of overlapping plot lines and transition points, so it's easy to find a stopping point mid-episode and then pick back up the next day.

One of my favorite things about this show is there are no pure ""white hat"" good guys, instead everyone has his or her flaws. There are, however, a couple of characters that are almost pure evil. Some of the more cutthroat characters turn out over time to have redeeming qualities after all.

My only criticism of the show is the overuse of profanity. I don't object to the use of expletives, but this show takes it to the extreme, to the point where it becomes almost comical, and definitely distracts from the story. There's a lot of gruesome violence too, but that seems to fit better with the overall story.",1478563200,,816,4.433333333333334

I remain in the spell of the Shakespearean dialog, and the rotating Greek chorus of actors whose conversations, which can happen at any time, enlighten us on both past and current events. You have to listen to this show like no other in order to keep up. The acting and their intensity in every scene is hypnotic.

2536584,5,B000EULSR0,"I'm a Deadwood fan at my core. There's a tinge of class when it comes to this show, you slowly love each of the characters and what they have developed into over the course of the shows short lived tenure. This is one of the few crime noire shows you tend to just love the protagonist (antagonistic by nature) crime Lord more as each season moves forward.

Where in shows like The Sopranos or boardwalk empire, you tend to dislike the main crime Lords more and more as you are exposed to the sub human parts of their psyche. In Deadwood I found myself loving Ian Mcshane's 'Al Swarangin' more and more as I watched.

Overall I'd issue the show as an excellent mix between The Sopranos and mad men, in that it created what I'd assume is a somewhat fair representation of the Deadwood camp in the early stages of the gold rush while mixing in some great elements of crime dramas of today.

Watch Deadwood, you won't regret it!",1476921600,,924,4.391812865497076

2536662,4,B000EULSR0,"The acting is top notch as are the production values, especially the costume designers and set designers, builders, and decorators. Due to the casting, almost every character, including the background extras, are 100% believably authentic. The only exception here is the character Jane who is neither believable, nor from my research and reading, accurate. The fault here lies not with the actress portraying Jane, though I think she was miscast, but with the writers who developed the character. All of the above attributes, notwithstanding the Jane character, combine to lead the viewer to believe they are peeking through a 60"" HD time-window into an 1876 mining town in the Black Hills of the Dakota territory.

In my opinion, the biggest fault is the language (dialog) which is very stilted, archaic, and indirect. It may perhaps be accurate, but it does at times make the dialog difficult to follow and even to understand what the characters are talking about or referring to. And this doesn't even include the excessive vulgarity from everyone including the female characters. It seems as if every second or third word from every character is either the ""F"" word or a common vulgarity referring to a person performing fellatio. While I am quite sure that today's vulgarities were well known in 1876, I am also equally sure they weren't so liberally used as is depicted in this show. Because of the language, one sometimes might feel they are being verbally assaulted.

Also in my opinion, the sexual situations depicted should be a little less explicit and porn-like. The imagination is much more powerful than is the actual visual, which is why reading a book is always better than seeing the movie. If you are old enough to remember ""Vargas Girls"" and the ""Playboy"" mags of the 1950s and early 19660s, you understand the allure and seduction of almost, but not quite seeing, to the vulgarity of ""Hustler"". This is definitely not a show for those of tender age or of tender morals.

As a result of the unrealistic character, Jane, the excessive use of vulgarisms, and explicit sexual situations, I gave the show 4 stars. Nevertheless, it is worth the time to watch; if you can handle the language and the sex.",1475539200,3,2217,4.906666666666666

2536929,5,B000EULSR0,"This has got to be the best television series I have ever watched. The language used is not for the faint of heart but the reality of the show leaves nothing to the imagination.  I enjoyed the show so much that I finally visited the real town of Deadwood in South Dakota. Many of the characters in the series are taken from life and are still part of the deadwood history. The only disappointing aspect of this wonderful television drama is that it appears there was supposed to be a fourth season and it never came about.  This leaves a few unanswered questions making the last show of the third season very frustrating. Still I would recommend anybody who loves excellent acting, colorful characters and a true real-life reality in a series should begin as soon as possible to view this epic presentation before it is no longer available on Amazon.",1472342400,,850,4.622516556291391

The multiple overuse of three ways to describe characters, i.e., F'ers, MF'ers, and CS'ers, and the additional over use of the F word in all of its iterations to describe surprise, hatred, suspicion, joy, sorrow, love, and almost any other emotion, amounts to an overworked clich that leaves me cold instead of merely disgusted. Also, there is not a single character in the production who I would speak to on the street, much less invite into my home through the medium of television. I originally decided to put up with these turnoffs in order to watch and see any redeeming value in the episodes, but I found none.",1470787200,,707,4.656

2537112,5,B000EULSR0,"I had never heard of the tv series, Deadwood.  A friend mentioned it in passing and said that the DVDs was available at the library.  She said that the series was highly praised for it's authenticity of the old west.  Well, I am a great fan of my prime membership so decided if it was there and it was.  It was free to watch because of my prime membership.  Before I started watching it I mentioned that I was going to start the series.  They told me how the had bought all three seasons at a big box store and the show was great.  I started to watch it and was hooked from the start.  The flavor of the time, the characters, the moral good and bad had me.  It was hard to get used to listening to the crude language and the violence but watching the good and evil play off of each other and seeing that the good could be bad and the bad could be good was fascinating.  I would highly recommend all three seasons and just wish that there were more seasons to watch.",1468886400,,965,4.085106382978723

The swearing can be jarring but you eventually get used to it.  Not sure the cowboys/miners of the late 1800s swore like that - sounds at little too 20th century to me.

For anyone that is not comfy with sailor-speak, bare women, spontaneous death events, wanton racial talk, and endless crime of one sort or another, you might want to leave this to the hardier breed of play action watching types. I always love Timothy in whatever, Ian McShane owns this baby and the camera can't get enough of him when ever he is in the scene. Deadwood is worth whatever it costs just to hang with Powers Boothe one more time as well. The staging, props, clothing, gold mine equipment, telegraph apparatus, guns, peculiar dialog, even right down to the river of mud that was definitely there back in the day, all top notch.

Viewpoints of both Swearengen and Bullock and why they do the things they do, and their devotion to how they view the Deadwood camp and how they have different ways of dealing with it all.  One of my favorite shows of all time and it came around when HBO was at the top of its game, with 5 or 6 of the best shows going on at the same time.  Back when Sundays were 'made for HBO'.  It would have been great if this show had been allowed to continue, but the majority of the actors who shined here went on to much greater things.

2537438,5,B000EULSR0,"This is my second Amazon review of Deadwood. The first was offered without the urging of Amazon back in the stone age when we put shiny plastic disks into black boxes which made pictures and sound appear on the glass screen of another big box we would all gather around.
This review OTOH is in reply to the gentle urging of Bezos et al who we assume are benignly monitoring our streaming habits and seeing an uptick in Deadwood streaming. You might think they are seeking a pulse in the era of 6"" phone screens and ADHD as it relates to binge watching.
Let it go. Robot emails get sent to everybody that watches anything on Prime and we ain't special. That's about the size of it.... but...

Let's not forget that Deadwood remains the best example of how tele-dramas can be made that do not insult the viewers gray matter, how the overlay of contemporary mores and attitudes can be used to hook us in with familiarity and then keep us hooked because it uses that familiarity to immerse us in a world that is both as compelling a reproduction of a time and place as is likely possible, and at the same time so alien to everything we think we know that it's more times than not uncomfortable to digest.

Period series get saddled with employing current social dilemmas into their plots. That kind of proselytizing can be suffered in more mainstream fluff but it's a dealbreaker for me. Then there's the commensurate revisionism that moves to reshape the social structure of the period to reflect what we would prefer it had been or worse, what we want ours to be now. Drivel. Actors, writers and directors are under some obligation to play ball and the final product often reflects the creation by committee approach.
Deadwood not so much. Deadwood was in your face about a time and place and the people trying to survive in that world. Profane, illiterate, filthy and unstoppable. Not unstoppable like action heroes, unstoppable like small people eking out a survival strategy daily, sometimes by the minute. The unrepentant writing, remarkable performances and the most authentic sets I have ever seen, big screen or small... well sometimes, too often, somebody invokes the ""magic "" of motion pictures. Here's one show that fits the bill. Magic.

10 years have passed since the last season and the impact of Deadwood still resonates.

Watch Peaky Blinders and see a current example of how the Deadwood form has been applied to the period following the Great War in England. That show is not Deadwood, but it is very good. Good enough to be spoken of in the same breath as Deadwood.

I have a video collection of thousands of titles which we rarely take advantage of.  The endless selection that the net provides is more in sync with our mantra to not dwell on the past when so much is available. That's yet another rule that Deadwood is an exception to.

Maybe there is something to the complaint that there's nothing any good on tv anymore. Maybe on your tv. On our tv, we can just stream Deadwood.",1463529600,4,2999,4.63653483992467

The language was overboard with the profanity, although the producers tried to negate the scatalogical diction with the verbose  speech of a few characters. Too much violence taken to great extremes such as feeding the corpses to pigs. YUK? We skipped a lot of this film because we were tired of viewing  the shocking details rather than the historical events of the period.

I've watched ""Deadwood"" so many times I can quote dialogue along with the characters (I have to be careful not to quote everything ""LOL""; Loaded with cursing using many words/phrases considered the worst & most offensive).
The cursing is appropriate to the time, place & story and unless someone is sensitive to foul language, it enhances the experience of watching Deadwood. Watching the show inspired a summer vacation to South Dakota which was one of my most enjoyable.

The tempo was a little slow, and the really excessive ""F"" bomb usage took away from both the story and the acting. Paula Malcomson was great as Trixie, but the writers could have re-written her lines a bit. Swearing and vulgarity does not make sense when literally used every other word. I am by no means a prude.

2537690,5,B000EULSR0,"Cons:
Each season gets more violent, sexually explicit and vulgar. This is certainly not for an audience adverse to foul language, explicit sex and violence. The story line goes into very dark evil parts of people and society as the wild west begins to become exploited by the rich and corrupt.
Pros:
The story line is full of intrigue and completely unpredictable. Their is good in most people somewhere deep down no matter how evil they appear and their behaviors. Romantic relationships twist and turn while love continues in different forms. Sadness exists in most unexpected ways and the reactions of the community members is are touching and unexpected in some of the nastiness of all. If you follow the story line and ignore the vulgarity it is a story that likely portrays the real will west versus earlier story lines. It is an ugly journey from wild to governance.
Summary:
I enjoyed this season with some tears, laughter, shock and rejection of the vulgarity. Somewhat shocked that I was able to distance myself from the foul language, etc. Totally unexpected story line. I binge watched many nights.",1457740800,,1111,4.914893617021277

It seems to me that Robin Wiegert overplayed the Calamity Jane part.  I keep wondering if the Pinkertons were that vicious and actually guns for hire back in those days.

It is a time of rough and tumble existence.  The sets are amazing, such as the fist fight in the mud, the recovery from traumas with little or no anesthesias available, the lives of the ""whores,"" the failed attempts at peacekeeping, the stagecoaches.

I'm not a prude and don't mind cursing generally but the vulgar language in this show is way over the top. The ""f"" word is used like a drug addict in a room full of cocaine. It's like every sentence contains about 3-4 variations of this word and then throw in all the other cussing.

Well some things were obvious, too many new characters and subplots and storylines, but the writing changed. Everybody only speaks in riddles now.

Also, just so you know, they use the ""F"" word so much it seems there shouldn't be enough of a supply of that word left for any of the rest of the world to be able to use it!

  Shakespeare meets Greek tragedy, meets the past lifestyle where I live now.

I find myself imagining what life must have been like there and down in the nearest towns.  This whole series paints a wonderful glimpse into what I know and have heard my area of the Rockies was like.
  I am a woodworker and have Friends in the movie industry.  It is all illusion created for entertainment but this series creates a great one an all ways from sets, writing , directing and of course acting.

A shame the execs were too greedy  and short sighted to continue the series......  Of course what do I know about running a successful TV network,,, nothing....  I suppose money always trumps art..  Only complaint against deadwood is the overuse of profanity...  I think that  such profuse profanity  is a modern urban phenomenon, not a major part of the old American west.

I am surprised that some other network did not pick this one up ...  Of course there were a lot of big name stars  in the cast and I am sure the production cost was huge.",1441670400,,648,4.444444444444445

2538671,5,B000EULSR0,"Tuning out the language, I absolutely love this series!  My son-in-law refers to it as ""Cowboy Porn"", but honestly, I was able to look beyond any of that & was just so into the time period, the surroundings, who the people were & how they lived.  I am so into this period of history with researching my ancestors...BOTH sides of the family on my mother's side initially settled in Dakota Territory.  My Great Grandfather, Fritz Giselman(Bavaria) was even the Butcher at Fort Buford right around the time Sitting Bull surrendered.  Fritz met my Great Grandmother, Elizabeth(Bessie) Gynther(Finland) as she was a cook for an Army Officer & his family at Ft. Buford.  They were married in 1895 in Williston, North Dakota, after Fort Buford closed.(I was thrilled to find a pic of their second born, my Great Uncle ""Bill"" Giselman, on ebay!!) They farmed & raised cattle for 6 years outside Minot, ND before homesteading in Alberta, Canada.  What they went through was just miraculous!  People who think they are struggling now, really need to get into the history of this country & see how & what people went through before us & the path carved for our freedom...intensely interesting!  I enjoyed all 3 season's & was extremely disappointed they stopped at season 3!!",1440460800,2,1264,4.873831775700935

I must admit, I remain amazed at hearing every curse word known at the time and still used today in my living room as well as nudity that I never heard or saw back in the day when I subscribed to HBO and Showtime when cable TV was an infant!

Ian McShane Pirate of the Caribbean, The Pillars of the Earth, etc).  Of course, most know of Tim Olyphant in Justified (maybe a close second).  Produce David Milch captured a marvelous time in U.S. history and revealed it in stunning detail.  I am currently watching the entire 3 seasons for the fifth time!",1437436800,,482,4.5813953488372094

Outstanding acting, directing and production.  Vast majority of major figures are real and the telling of Deadwood does not violate the known facts from the dozen or so characters who's real name was used.

I was a bit taken back by the language and violence; but, once I got beyond it, I could not get enough of this series. The story line and acting are terrific. I have grown to love the characters, even Ian McShane's character Al. It's hard to image that Deadwood was such a lawless place. I lived in Rapid City many years ago and had been to Lead and Deadwood. After watching this, I want to make another visit. I have told several friends about this series. I'm at the end of season 2 and will start season 3 shortly. I know I will miss watching it when it ends.",1437177600,,633,4.154471544715447

2538974,4,B000EULSR0,"I love anything with Timothy Olyphant in it but honestly, I just love the whole Deadwood series.  The ONLY and single reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because of the overly gratuitous use of one particular cuss word, that being c@(k sucker, and you hear it at least, I'm estimating, 20 or 30 times per episode!  I am so far from being a prude but it's just makes me scratch my head as to what the logic was to include it in the script over and over and over and it's used by most of the entire cast and not by just one single character.  Obviously, I still love the show and can't wait to finish watching all of the other seasons because I'm totally into it and want to see what happens. The repetitive use of that word just starts to take away from the show to me.  It's actually annoying and my 27 year old daughter was in the house while I was watching an episode and she even commented on how often they say it.  Ha, who knows, maybe it was a very popular word in those days and its inclusion is historically accurate, LOL.",1436832000,,1025,4.105

The only thing I do not like is the constant vulgarity.  I do realize this show is set in a rough and tumble mining camp with an inordinate number of rough miners.  Vulgarity is to be expected.  However, the vulgarity is so over the top that I will only watch this show when my wife and children, (not little kids.  Adults and in their late teens), are not home.

This is my small, guilty pleasure.  If you are prepared for the peppered dialogue, the story-line is very good.  This is not something I would consider ""family friendly.""",1431648000,,809,4.517241379310345

I don't know why the series ended when the acting and writing were so good. I guess that viewership must not have equaled the cost to make it. Really a shame as it was wonderful.
The characters are almost Shakespearian in their speech, quite a step up from what the real denizens of Deadwood would have spoken I'm sure. On the other hand the streets are muddy and the clothes worn to a fray that gives it a more realistic feel of that time.

2539334,4,B000EULSR0,"The story, the actors, the acting are truly excellently done. And, I suspect the scenery gives a reasonably accurate remembrance of what gold rush mining camps, the sawmill towns, land rush camps, and small, rapidly growing settler farming towns of America's Wild West years, the mid to late 1800's, looked like. However, every scene is running-over with unnecessary cursing, overwhelming, nauseating foul language, and an almost total emphasis on prostitutes and dishonest, murderous bar owners. Such heavy reliance on this kind of lead character once again comes across as an enormous failure of ""secular"" atheist Hollywood writers, directors, and producers to be able to fully comprehend normal people or to understand the true source, the faith, character, personal strength, and determination which built our great nation.",1430352000,,827,5.571428571428571

2539355,5,B000EULSR0,"Deadwood is a must-watch. The show has everything. Outstanding performances, quality writing, impeccable production design...I could go on. Ian McShane's turn as Al Swearengen is awe-inspiring. At times brutal and ruthless, at others tragic and heart-wrenching, Deadwood manages to do what so few television programs can; it takes you to the place that you're watching. You'll feel like you've sat down at a Pharaoh Table in the Gem Saloon. You'll feel like you're in the queue in ""Farnum's absurd little restaurant"". You may even become so absorbed as to smell the muck of the thoroughfare, the exotic smells of the Chinese Immigrant quarter, and the scent of hope, folly, and violence wafting through the trees.

Season 2 in particular is a highlight of the (depressingly) short run of the series. Set some months after the finale of Season 1, we are introduced to the machinations of George Hearst via his scheming and monstrous representative Francis Wolcott. Sheriff Bullock (Timothy Olyphant)'s family joins him in the camp early on and he struggles to integrate him into his life. Sol Star and Trixie continue their dalliances. The crew of the Gem Saloon are as entertaining and hopelessly dim-witted as ever. Please...stop reading and watch this show. You'll thank me for it.",1430265600,,1283,5.138755980861244

2539381,5,B000EULSR0,This was an excellent show. The scope and cost of production for this show must have been mind-boggling. Every last detail was attended to. Zero flaws. Season 3 got even better with regards to Swearingen's character development. Turns out he only just 'seems' like a prick from the outside.  There is a lot of profanity. Perhaps even a 60/40 ratio of profanity to other vocabulary.  lol  It took me a minute to get into the rhythm of it but after that you don't even really notice it.

2539488,5,B000EULSR0,My only problem with Deadwood is that there is only three seasons.  I am sure that some of the language used in the series is not quite how it was during the 1890's but who cares.  I can't get enough.  The characters are colorful and pretty realistic.  The setting seems to be historically correct with some license taken to add a modicum of gore and sex.  I am glad that we don' have smell-o-vision though.  Now that Justified is about done I am anxious to see what Timothy Olyphant will do next.,1428019200,,497,4.3478260869565215

2539490,1,B000EULSR0,Second season worse than the first season.  Obsessively contrived dialogue was completely unnecessary and made more unattractive with excessive profanity that set a new low for script writing.,1428019200,2,192,5.857142857142857

Some of the characters are based upon real people - Al Swearangen, Bullock & Star, Calamity Jane, etc, while others are created based upon a combination of people.  There is a lot of profanity in this series, which gives the impression of Deadwood being a place that's operating outside the confines of normal civilization.  The story lines this season are based on Bullock's wife arriving in Deadwood, ending his relationship with Alma Garrett, power struggles between Swearangen and Cy Tolliver, and impending annexation to the state - South Dakota, or maybe Montana or Wyoming.  Well written and well acted, and very much in keeping with the way things occurred around 1890 at that place (although I've read that the writers replaced the 4-letter words of the day with current ""cuss words"", because the cusses from 125 years ago sound funny, not profane).",1426636800,,900,5.1020408163265305

The main character's wife shows up, the tension between the camps and women become more of the story, the sex and violence is toned down a bit.

It's ALL about the characters who totally drive these stories through the muddy, messy, mayhem that is the Main Street of this 'Camp'.  The feel of authenticity, the range of characters AND the range within each character is a thing of beauty in a setting that is completely desolate.

The writing of the  script is witty and exceptionally well done in the verbiage of the period. Second to that, the acting of said script. After that, I'd have to tip my hat to the authenticity of historical facts. They featured many historical people that were, in fact, in Deadwood at that time. Now, HBO did make some changes for dramatic license. Like making the Swerengen character from England instead of Oklahoma which was where he was  actually from.

I thought it had at least a 4th season to go yet, should have looked ahead I guess.  The only thing I did not like about the show was the language as the big F, and the one word women really hate, was used every other word at times.  I can't believe people actually talked like that, even in the gold rush setting.  I am no prude by any means but the use of foul language went way overboard.  Other than that...it was one of the best shows I have ever watched.  Ian McShane was amazing as ""Swearengen"", what an actor that man is.  Hats off also to Robin Weigert (Calamity Jane) and Paula Malcomson (Trixie) for their superb acting.  I loved all the characters in the show but they really stood out.

Really good acting, wardrobe'n, etc. The dialogue surprised me and I find it highly unlikely people of that era spoke that way. Also, *WARNING* it has A LOT of salty language; this is not what you'll watch on family night. Also, yet one more *WARNING*... do not be drink'n or whatever when you watch this.

2540092,5,B000EULSR0,"This is really a good series.  Good characters, good actors, and a vision of the old West much more historically correct than that of GUNSMOKE  Not recommended for little kids though.  Language, nudity, violence.",1417564800,,212,5.176470588235294
2540093,5,B000EULSR0,"I was never able to see the show on HBO, and honestly have never heard it had been cancelled (?) That said after the first episode in season 1 I was hooked, then found out there were only 3 seasons...ARGH! I think the problem with Deadwood for HBO was that the dialogue was TOO GOOD! The writing was TOO GOOD! Acting was TOO GOOD! so they decided to get rid of it. They lucked out on Game of Thrones the last few years, Boardwalk Empire it pretty good as well, but Deadwood was better than either of those overall. Wish they would bring it back just to give it a proper finale. Overall if you love all the things that are TOO GOOD above this show is for you :)  C-suckers",1417564800,,671,4.122137404580153

2540140,5,B000EULSR0,"A TV series which is flawed in every possible dimension. The violence and crudeness is appalling. Yet I am drawn into caring about even the most despicable characters - not caring for them necessarily, but tremendously absorbed by  what happens to them. There is a balance between the clichd/iconic and the idiosyncratic and human aspects of the characters and the drama itself that reminds me of Shakespeare. It deepens and seems to become more free and more itself with every episode (I am still in the second season).",1416700800,,520,4.909090909090909

It is so real to life of that time, you forget you're watching TV.
The death of young William Bullock and the reactions, lack thereof and social dynamics make this series become 3D in your head even though it is only HD 2D on your screen.

2540315,5,B000EULSR0,"Once you get beyond the epic profanity and pigs eating one murder victim after the next, this is a sweeping Shakespearean-style tragedy with astonishingly complex characters, superb scenery, and unpredictable plotting. No, this isn't the real Deadwood, and not even Shakespeare talked like these guys. And I understand why many viewers were simply repulsed by the unceasing swearing and sexism, racism, bigotry and graphic sex and violence that, if you watch long enough, simply becomes embedded in the narrative. I do believe that movie violence can encourage violence in real life, but this series is different. In a classic sense, this descent into hell has a purging emotional effect because, deep inside, all of the characters are struggling against their own inner demons in an effort to be good, or to do good, or just to cope with their darker side. It is this soap opera, played out against a more mannered era than today, combined with the lawlessness of Deadwood and its foul-mouthed population that creates an unforgettable alternative universe from which we cannot look away.

Why 4 stars?  Well, Amazon has taken to pulling final seasons from Prime.  I have started watching several series where the final season was pulled off Amazon Prime!  WHAT!  This was very upsetting, and if I had to rate Amazon Prime, it would have gone from an EASY 5 stars, down to 1 or 2 for this move, which I have seen repeated on several series.  This is just lame.

So the highest I will rate an Amazon Prime series is 4 stars if it is awesome, and 2-3 stars if merely good.  The fact that I give Deadwood 4 stars is indicative of how great this show is.  It is only one of a few I would rate this highly, another being Band of Brothers, since it is great and luckily only one season, so Amazon cannot truncate the end on me.

The Amazon Prime move of chopping off the final season of this & other great series is just a lame move.",1412812800,,928,4.043956043956044

This season takes the characters we came to know in season one and has them come together in new ways.

My season one review:
""This show is not what I thought it would be. I was expecting a foul mouthed western (which it is) but it is also the story of a town coming together much like a family.
Also unexpected was the dark humor which mostly comes from the excellent Ian McShane playing the surprisingly sensitive Al Swearengen.
Often, with high quality television, it takes a few episodes for the characters to really gel and Deadwood is no exception.
This show really finds it's groove about halfway through the first season.

A lot of people trying to sound intelligent (more than the character would have) and the foul language cuts down the value of the movie as well as the enjoyment.
Hollywood has it way off base for the language and character portrayal of those years.
1. The Majority People had more integrity than the movie plays out and were trying to make a better way of life. Most were of European descent who were trying to get away from the tyranny and heavy hand of selfish, ruthless rulers who think the people are here to serve them rather than what our country is founded on. The elected officials are here to serve the public Not rule them. That is why we had a revolution and why we have our constitution. To protect us from those who would rule rather than serve.
2.  2. Their language was not nearly as bad as the movie portrays.
3. This could have been a good series but again, Hollywood would have us believe everyone exploring or developing our country were drunks swearing with every other word and had no morels. Seems like Hollywood is trying to rewrite American history to make us think the settlers were vicious and wrong in helping create this wonderful country of ours.

The fact that the ""f'"" word is used thousands of timesas an adverb, an adjective, punctuation and sometimes as the subjectbecomes very monotonous and cartoonish. The series left me hanging without a conclusion or a satisfying timeout. Olyphant, McShane, Parker, Dickens, McRaney and Callie's characters were very good.

2540484,5,B000EULSR0,"This series is absolutely one of the most quintessential American west series ever produced. The acting is incredible. Every plays an integral role in the series, and each character leaves you spellbound in their role. Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant are seriously underrated Actors. Both make this series a must watch with their riveting acting. Also, what makes this series fascinating is the introduction of factual figures from the American West, such as Wild Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp, Calamity Jane, etc. I don't know how accurate some of the storyline regarding these figures are, but nonetheless quite interesting.  I would rate Deadwood up there with The Soprano's, Orange is the New Black, and Breaking Bad. Anyone who has an interest in the raw and rugged life that must have been the wild west, I feel, would surely find this series to have great entertainment value. Unlike many series where you can see the writers creative waning as the season progress, Deadwood is as riveting the last few episodes as it was the very first. Why it ended so prematurely is beyond me. I suppose Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant (Justified) decided to go on to do other things. I can earnestly say that after watching Deadwood S1-3, that both McShane and Olyphant are two of my favorite Actors. A must watch!",1410393600,,1304,4.900452488687783

2540486,2,B000EULSR0,"First, Tim Oliphant had a minor role in this series, do if you're a fan don't watch to see him in a star performance. The acting is good by all the cast, but the script and the dialogue are so offensive that I have decided I cannot finish the series. It's the most vulgar piece of writing that I have ever come across.  I am sure that Deadwood in 1873 was a wild raucus place, but the 21st century foul-mouth words did not exist back then. The language is so bad and so nonstop that it distracts you from any good points that the series might have. It makes you feel like you need a bath afterward to wash away some of the dung.

2540487,2,B000EULSR0,"I am becoming more disappointed by the episode.  It seems that the writers are in a contest to see who can use the words f#*k and  c##*K S@#$Ker more in a scene.

2540555,1,B000EULSR0,Can't handle the language...just does not seem authentic to the time period. The swearing is extremely gratuitous and distracts from the story.  That is my opinion.  Obviously the show is very popular and many will disagree but  that just shows how desensitized we have become as a society to gutter talk.  Too bad.,1409097600,2,315,4.886792452830188

No real person uses it in every sentence they say. In the show all most every character speaks like that. For me it's a distraction from what is a really good series.,1408406400,,339,4.3125

And boy does it have some characters! With all of the gold, whiskey, thieves, and whores, there's bound to be plenty going on. For some, the violence and cussing might be too much, but hey, the real west wasn't like Gunsmoke with Marshall Dillon and Kitty! I don't believe the marshall ever even kissed her in twenty seasons.

2540685,3,B000EULSR0,Do you really think that was the way they talked then.  Half the time you can't understand what they're talking about.  A short reply or question winds up to be so long you don't know what they are saying. No one went to school back then where do they come off with such long dialog and some words they use. It is an interesting show which I will continue to watch to the end,1407715200,,375,4.054054054054054

2540696,4,B000EULSR0,Terrific show and characters but the swearing is oppressive and gratuitous. The swearing doesn't even fit the situation many times. I researched Deadwood's actual history and many of the characters are real but I'm sure they didn't use the same few words over and over and over. I believe Calamity Jane's character would be a mute without swearing. Even with it the part added nothing to the show.,1407542400,,397,4.852941176470588

There as so much cursing that you had no idea what was going on because no one could speak ENGLISH! The foul language ""dominated"" the script. Pathetic. FACT: No one during that TIME PERIOD had no idea was the ""F"" Word meant much less used it. I curse a lot and the use of those words are for a reason...they are not ""to be abused"" nor did it add to the script or characters in anyway.

There are many words and articulations by the actors that I don't believe would be true by folks who lived in that era. Having said this, I also don't think the extraordinary amount of swear words accurately portrays the era either.

2540783,4,B000EULSR0,"1876 Black Hills of the Dakota territory gold rush where anything goes in a settlement with no laws.  Murder, prostitution, alcohol and drug abuse are the norm.  It not only happens daily, it happens around the clock.  It's a story of dominance by a hand full of people, characters nearly larger then life itself, in a free for all capitalist dog eat dog environment - totally Darwinian.  As the story moves towards the thrid season, it's also a story of how raw power, already establish power can bribe and murder its way towards more established power as the settlement begins to vote for law and move away from frontierism. The drive to get the gold out of the ground is the engine that drives the settlement.  There does not seem anything like this series of which I am aware.  The characters are fully developed so much so that they jump out of the screen.  Warning:  if profanity, copulation, or murder - slicing throats bother you, you had better stay clear of this series because it happens continuously throughout.",1406678400,,1023,4.707865168539326

2540833,5,B000EULSR0,"The foul language is excessive, not because it's foul, but because sometimes it is every other word. That is fine when someone is upset or in another context, but otherwise, at least in the first 5 episodes, it detracted from the story line because it's like hitting a cringe worthy verbal speed bump. I am sure that people in a mining town used profane, foul, 'bad' words as regular parts of their speech, but it's like the writers were 5 year olds learning a new word. There seems as if there should be some sort of non modern foul expletive/descriptive they could have thrown in there every few verbal eructions...
Having started with that caveat, I will say the rest of the dialog, and the sets, storyline and acting is excellent. Things are dirty, look like they smell bad, life is hard and unfair, people are fallible, greedy, murderous, and yet even the bad guys have a shining moment sometimes.

There still are some great characters and some very enjoyable moments.  One strange thing is the extreme overuse of the term ""coc-sucker"" which I truly don't mind in and of itself but in this show it is literally used in every sentence nearly every other word!  It was down right distracting!

2540856,5,B000EULSR0,"Absolutely LOVE the series Deadwood.  It's one of the few series that I've gone back to watch over and over and over again.

It appears to be very accurate in its details and portrayal of characters that were 'real' people of the time period. It just sits them down into a life likely situations.  Again, all this attention to the details is what has made me and a lot of others watch it repeatedly.

My only criticism of the program is for the last season.  You can feel it in the last few episodes.  It feels like the Executive Producers and et al heard from HBO that it was to be the last season and told the writers to wrap-it-up.  And they did.  Kinda just changed purpose of the seasons basic storyline and just wrapped-it-up.  To me it feels incomplete.  I mean it's all still 4 stars good and if you weren't looking to closely you probably wouldn't mind or even notice.  It's good but the end of the story feels unfinished to me and not quite up to the same standards as the rest of the story, GREAT.

Ah yes, another downside is the profanity.  Lots of it.  Crudity, too.  But, again, that is probably the way it was for a bunch of men living together the way they were in those little gold mining towns.  No ladies around to civilize them.  Attention to the details in every way.

All that said I still give it a great 5 Big stars.",1405814400,,1341,4.253968253968254

It's mostly what happens in daily life back in the late 1800's. I didn't know that back then everyone was a f***ing co**sucker; but according to this show that's how everyone talked , even the women.

2540860,5,B000EULSR0,"As in season 1, evolving multiple story lines are the rule of thumb in season 2.  Also like season 1, each episode of season 2 tends to include 1 or more soliloquys, often spoken by either Farnum and/or Swearengen.  This technique adds an interesting Shakespearean touch to the show - something rarely seen in 'westerns'.

By the way, where do you go to get a license for being poetic?  Anyhow, I wish I could verify that they really spoke this way, it would be interesting.

Deadwood is a great model for human development and expansion with all of its pros and cons.  Well thought out scripts loosely parallel real events and people blurring the historical accuracy in the spirit of better story telling.  Who knows if history is accurate or just the first attempt.

Like any bad soap opera, the storyline ( which is, mostly, unrecognizable)  is painfully dull and needlessly drawn out.  Characters often break into rambling, incoherent monologues.  An entire episode focused on a character ( who had, mysteriously, lost his English accent since the last season ) trying to pass a stone that was lodged in his bladder. A very bizarre and overly graphic series of scenes.

To be fair, I did not, and will not see the entire second season.  I only made it to the backed up bladder episode.  It is sad to see that this passes for a western.",1405296000,,644,4.696428571428571

just keeps improving. He finds the incessant cussing to be distracting
and says it was usually not part of the story flow.
He says Ian McShane is a strong lead actor and he makes everybody
else work to keep up. Timothy Oliphant is hampered from fully emoting by

2540981,5,B000EULSR0,"Firstly, let me say that I DO NOT WATCH TELEVISION!  the last time I owned a tv myself was about1990.  I just wasn't willing to give up READING time to watch poorly produced, badly acted, atrociously written material I had already seen when I was 12 years old (a long time ago) rehashed and regurgitated.  While I have total respect for performance art, not much of that carried over to production broadcast tv.  A few exceptions existed of course, as talent will almost always exert itself given opportunity.  Notably in my opinion were ""Soap"" and ""Night Court"" which I saw a few episodes of (no disclosure of tv owner or positions during viewing available) and occasionally some other one (the ""Designing Women""  guest starring Gerald McRaney).  I was delighted to see him again in ""Deadwood"" as the totally despicable George Hurst.

Recently, I was given a 30 day free trial of Amazon Prime, and since I had only ever heard a couple of references to ""Deadwood"" as ""revisionist western"" I plopped my self down for ""a few minutes"" because Timothy Olliphant was brilliant in the two episodes of ""Justified"" I was exposed to (details deleted) based on work by one of my favorite authors, the absolute master, Elmore Leonard.

The few turned into a virtual marathon as this was much more the ""West"" I imagined than ""Big Valley"" or ""Petticoat Junction"".  I was enthralled!  Every member of the cast was at the top of the curve in every respect, the set and action superb and I met one of the all time best ""bad guys"" in the persona of Al Swearingin.

For absolutely top notch entertainment, chance to observe performance detail and production value way beyond the usual. and the resulting smile at the end of each episode, I have never seen anything close enough to be called competition to this series.

The second season was rich with detailed character expansion on the development from the first season.  There are simply too many examples to start singling out  rants and interactions, but the dialog and soliloquies will go down in my personal history of visual drama as one of the top three all time best productions of the fantasy labeled ""Wild West"".

I submit that cable development during my hiatus away from the ""small screen"" has introduced many needed changes in our perception of drama (and comedy) in motion, and provided opportunity for many excellent actors to expand themselves beyond what formerly passed as ""good tv"", but it has also presented that opportunity to writers, directors and all the myriad staff required to  complete such demanding and detailed work.

My hat is off to everyone involved in this particular exposition, and if they had more stars than five, I would grant all of them.  While I am sure my kudos won't make much difference to the participants in this effort which is now in the ""past""  I hope it will serve to induce others to watch and appreciate this magnificent effort.

2541033,5,B000EULSR0,"In my review of Deadwood's first season, I whined about Tim Olyphant's near-constant facial expressions of emotional constipation and apparent disgust. I am happy to say that in Season Two, his attentions have shifted to more familial concerns, with only the occasional pistol-whipping and painful grimace suggesting imminent outrage. Ian MacShane continues to shine as the center of power in Deadwood. The introduction of Garrett Dillahunt's new character, a quiet but homicidal emissary of an as yet unseen force  with whom Swearingin and Deadwood will have to contend, brings new intrigue. The issue of annexation becomes a central focus for Swearingin and the others, with Powers Boothe's Cy Tolliver pulling strings on the side and generally leaving the viewer to wonder just how much power and influence he'll manage to gather for himself if his association with Dillahunt's Wolcott character doesn't first blow up in his face.
Tragedy looms as the season comes to a close, but no spoilers here, my friend. As always, this motley bunch of miners and misfits curses up a storm and leaves you wanting more!",1403827200,,1110,5.166666666666667

2541037,4,B000EULSR0,"Ian McShane is an awesome and dynamic leading character!  In fact, I believe his character is THE singlely most effective energy in this very successful series. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as well, but lacks the full dynamics of his character - like in the series, ""Justified"".  The scenery is probably authentic for the time and location, but visually unattractive.  Narrow streets, unshaven and cantankerously drunken townspeople, and the township roads - always narrow and wet - one wonders why folks would choose to live in an environment like this (other than the obvious gold prospect, of course).  With all that aside, this series is compelling, energic, and wonderfully addictive.  I'm so looking forward to the next season.  Doug",1403827200,,740,5.228813559322034

If someone is buying this having already watched season 1 of Deadwood, this was a great season with an unfortunate dearth of Calamity Jane in the first part of the season. It depicted Deadwood's struggle to become official and choose which state to join and attempt to create a civil society and government.

2541066,5,B000EULSR0,"The comic Bard, if alive today, could have written this. Notwithstanding the constant, and I mean every 30 seconds or more, use of the F-bomb and/or C***Sucker, the dialogue is what makes this show so much fun! Especially in the hands of Ian McShane, who grabs the stage as his own every time he has the camera, and says these wonderful concoctions of language and thought that seem so out of place in a time like Deadwood, yet become as real a possibility as the horses in the street.

William Earl Brown is often the perfect foil, who hears his boss, struggles with us sometimes to make sense of it, eventually gets the gist, shrugs and moves on. Hard to imagine in print like this, but what fun!

And many others in this rich cast have their moments of literary flight. For a bunch of hardy self-preserving pioneers, for the most part without much of the education we would assume available at the time, they construct sentences that  sometimes baffle themselves, as well as many of our near illiterate college grads. Not everybody's cup of tea, especially in a western, but a total joy for oddballs like me.

The outstanding ensemble of characters also makes for a rich and rewarding viewing experience. Brad Dourif, Dayton Callie, William Sanderson, Jeffery Jones, Molly Parker, Keone Young, and especially Robin Weigert, as Calamity Jane, all make this show an actor's romp. They fill the screen each time they appear, and make it so much fun to watch and listen to them.

Timothy Oliphant may top the billing, but in season 2, at least, his Bullock often looks like a deer caught in headlights. I hate to say that, but he just seems as bewildered by it all as I suspect too many potential viewers were. While Bullock seems a worthy grandfather to Marshall Givens, Bullock just can't seem to find his place in this town. He seems much too reactive, without his own center. Perhaps season 3 will change that.

It is Ian McShane's season, if not show. Swearengen provides most of the subtle storyline, on which most of the rest of the cast operate, directly or indirectly. A band of independent pioneers just wanting to make a living in the ""uncivilized"" wilderness, but realizing they need to come together to form a working society that eventually will not only embrace them, but protect them as well. A slow process, both on screen and for the viewer, and certainly not the expected storyline for a western. Swearengen's foresight and understanding are unexpected, as he tries to manipulate this bunch of rowdies into place. Herding cats, not cattle, comes to mind.

So, if you don't care for Shakespearian dialog with the F-bomb more than replacing ""hath"", and if you don't enjoy in your face acting, this is probably not the show for you.

But if you are delighted by language, come from Brooklyn like I do and therefore not notice the F-bomb as anything unusual, and if you love to see actors having lots of fun doing what they love, you'll enjoy almost every minute of this delightful comic series.

The only shame is that there is only 3 seasons!",1403481600,,3058,4.690298507462686

2541123,5,B000EULSR0,Me from seeing this when it first aired!  Without a doubt this is one of the best series on HBO ever!  The acting is so in character that I am enthralled with each installment and follow it avidly as a schoolboy reads comic books.  What will happen next.  Always full of surprises with sudden departures of some characters without any warning!  A masterpiece on every level of its creation!  Someone very close to me grew up in the Wild West and the lingo sounds very close to what actually transpired on the Frontier!,1402790400,,518,4.516129032258065
2541124,5,B000EULSR0,"I have seen all three seasons, and all the episodes were exceptionally well written and scripted.  The actors are spot on in their portrayals. Of particular note is the poetic and philosophical commentary between the characters.  I found myself rewinding a number of times because there is a lot of depth in their conversations which can fly by rather quickly and is worth a second listen.  On another note, even though the story is fictionalized, it is based on the real town and the real inhabitants of Deadwood circa 1876.  It got me interested in the history of that area and the people in the series; Calamity Jane, Seth Bullock, Wild Bill, Hearst, etc.  The writers must have spent a great deal of time researching it themselves.  The only negative I could provide is that the series ends on season 3 without finishing the story.  I am not sure why HBO didn't continue with it; and now that so much time has passed, it is unlikely that it will ever be completed.  Great series though.",1402790400,,990,4.617142857142857
2541125,5,B000EULSR0,A great movie-rough language! Prob not for kids. I think this is how Deadwood really was-a rough and tumble town,1402790400,,112,4.65
2541126,5,B000EULSR0,loved it!  i'm so sorry it's over because it just left us hanging with storylines unfinished.  what happened to the doctor?  three seasons was not enough,1402790400,,153,4.8076923076923075

We came to really enjoy the characters, looking forward to what would happen next and then comparing it to the real history.  As I said in my comment about Season 1, wondering if they really talked like that and apparently then did. We found it too difficult to watch more than 3 episodes at a time, because we would spend so much time deciphering what they said.

There is a LOT of cussing - it seemed the only word they  knew was the F--- word. This is NOT FOR KIDS  - there is some graphic sex and constant referrals to sex. The acting  was great - and Timothy Olyphant is my new favorite actor.

If you have trouble with continuous swearing it is not for you but if you can get past the language and the occasional full-frontal nudity (both female and male), it's an excellent production. The setting is realistic, the storyline plausible and somewhat akin to reality and the acting is superb. It is easy to see why Ian McShane won a Golden Globe.

2541179,5,B000EULSR0,"I've been watching this since Amazon has had the HBO thing happening. Watching an episode or two some days keeps the continuity charged, when compared to the effect watching one episode per week would have. Ian McShane is the STAR here. His characterization of the complex Al Swearengen is worthy of an Oscar were it eligible. Not for the faint of heart or the squeamish, but grit on a level not often seen on screen. A credit to the producers, writers, performers and director. 10 out of 10!",1402099200,,492,4.6022727272727275
2541180,5,B000EULSR0,"Season 2 of Deadwood continues to develop the ensemble of core characters. The question of territorial annexation no longer looms but the camp's ability to defend the legitimacy of the gold claims brings new conflicts. Outside pressures from the territorial capital and from wealthy industrialist George Hurst bend the characters in new and interesting ways-- often in excruciating scenes that do not relent.

The dialogue even becomes more Shakespearean, as the characters (especially Swearengen and Farnum) talk to themselves more or use their words to navigate the intentions and loyalties of those around them.

Having watched Deadwood in its entirety on a couple of occasions, I know that this season does lead in to a messy Third Season. Second viewing is very different from first viewing: I can see some of the decisions that will lead to problems in the final season. The Hurst storyline in particular-- especially on second viewing-- leads to some of the show's weakest episodes.

But all in all, Second Season does a remarkable job of maintaining tension in the story and sympathy for all of the characters (even some of the vilest ones).",1402099200,,1149,5.101063829787234

2541184,5,B000EULSR0,Fascinating characters that are fit for their parts. Lost some verbal understanding but stuck with it because of sheer will to get the story as much as possible the second time around. Worst language ever.  Wondered if they really spoke like that? Loved the part of the doctor and the whores. Something grabbed me about this show 'cause it is off the beaten track for me....69 year old grandma.

Thus the entire season consists primarily of one soliloquy after another. Characters stand alone and talk aloud to themselves. Except for the occasional monologue Ian McShane delivers to a wood box with a dead Indian's head in it.

The curse words are so frequent it's impossible to believe they have any purpose, and how HBO got away with the number of times the N word is used in each episode is beyond me.",1401753600,,607,4.893203883495145

Plus the dialog is just over the top. Maybe they are trying to be period correct but its so hard to figure out what the heck they are talking about 3/4 of the time. Nudity and violence too which is always a plus. Judge for yourself.,1401667200,,403,3.9876543209876543

2541220,5,B000EULSR0,"Some might have found Deadwood to be too vulgar.  I say, ""That's the sign of the times"".  Deadwood was no dainty city.  Hell, it was barely a mudpatch in the Black Hills.  But Deadwood was Deadwood... wild and wooly with guns and whores for fun as well as life.

Timothy Olyphant plays a very believable character in Seth Bullock.  He's a former lawman who has headed west with his partner Sol Star (John Hawkes) who end up matching wits with or occasionally colluding with Al Swearengen (Ian McShane).  Love interests abound with Alma Garret (the lovely Molly Parker), the rich widow with a claim of some of the best producing ground in Deadwood.  Trixie (Paula Malcomson), plays the ever present 'hooker with the heart of gold'.  She and Sol ended up in some very interesting situations and conversations.

Deadwood portrays the area as accurately as possible.  They neither pull puncher nor sugar coat the world that was.  It's a helluva story.",1394755200,2,947,4.813664596273292

2541227,4,B000EULSR0,"Season 2 of Deadwood ramps up the tension as new alliances form, old rivalries fester, and civilization encroaches on a place that doesn't want to be totally civilized. Characters reach new heights as they cross boundaries between good sense and evil sensibility. In other words, the plotting is convoluted but very well portrayed. Ian McShane, of course, is stunningly brilliant. Similarly, supporting characters shine bright, including Calamity Jane and Trixie. The slight let down is Sheriff Bullock, who most of the time stands woodenly and seethes. Why? It's never quite clear other than that he's trying to control his impulse to shoot more people. Nonetheless, it is often distracting to the point of taking one away from the narrative. The only other criticism is the ""retelling"" of events as characters move from one group to another. The audience doesn't need a character to explain what just happened. It was seen on the screen. And the plot does move quite slow. But your time is well spent, deep in the bowels of a profane and vulgar place with a touch of humanity to keep it livable.",1393804800,,1097,4.935135135135135

The story is loosely based on real events so it has motivated me to look up the actual history of the area - fascinating!  One caveat -  this show is very graphic - nudity, violence, sex and constant use of the ""F"" word and its various combinations.

2541286,4,B000EULSR0,"1877. The camp of Deadwood in the Black Hills is gaining respectability as the gold rush continues. It has a mayor and a sheriff, and the neighbouring territory of Dakota is expressing interest in annexing the nascent town.

The second season of Deadwood is a partially successful extension of the themes of the first season. Order has arisen out of chaos, a new government and law for the town has been formed and people are starting to organise themselves. Deadwood is still a dangerous place - life remains cheap for many - but civilisation is coming. Against this backdrop Al Swearengen is still running shady deals but he has now become involved in political intrigue as he tries to get the best deal possible for the town. Sheriff Seth Bullock's interest in law and order is put aside as he tries to get to know the family he has inherited from his brother, whilst Joanie Stubbs's attempts to go solo and open her own whorehouse end in tragedy. There's a wider variety of storylines and characters in the second season, but they don't cohere as perfectly as they did in the first.

The core problem is the essentiality of Ian McShane's presence as Al Swearengen to the success of the show. A curious decision was made to spend about three episodes on Swearengen being indisposed on account of kidney stones, meaning that for a quarter of the season its main protag/antagonist is all but absent, only appearing to pee some blood on the floor. Interesting for its attention to period detail (medicine in the 1870s was terrifyingly primitive), but hardly dramatically compelling. In McShane's absence, some of the thinness of the other character arcs becomes more apparent. Alma Garrett spends a dozen episodes sitting in her rooms not doing very much. Seth Bullock spends most of the season agonising over what to do about his relationship with his inherited wife and stepson (to the point of completely missing a prostitute-murdering killer being loose in the town). It's notable that the second season of Deadwood springs back to life when Swearengen returns to the front line, influencing an important part of history (Deadwood's acceptance into the USA and what territory it will join) from behind his office desk, negotiating deals with hugely important businessmen George Hearst and sorting out an internecine conflict within the Chinese community. Most of HBO's other classic shows succeed with broad ensemble casts, with no central role to hang the storyline on (The Wire, for example, had an entire year in which Dominic West's McNulty barely appeared and it was arguably the best season), but Deadwood falters in Swearengen's absence.

That said, even a slightly disappointing season of Deadwood remains great television. As with the first season, the writing, characterisation and attention to detail are all superb. The dialogue is often a joy to listen to, and the show's morbid sense of humour results in laugh-out-loud moments. Alma's indecision over her future prospects is presented sympathetically, but with a true-to-the-period emphasis on realism over sentimentality. Bullock goes through a similar process. Both storylines are drawn out much too long, but are nevertheless explored well. More successful is the way the show presents Cy Tolliver as a man with the veneer of civilisation and decency, but with a seething, frustrated anger not far below the surface.

The second season of Deadwood (****) remains compelling viewing, but definitely falters compared to the first year. The pacing feels sluggish at times and the back-room dealings over the camp's future feels like set-up more than the main course. The writing and performances remain exemplary and the thematic developments are fascinating, which help make up for the shortcomings.",1369353600,,3769,5.113636363636363

I regret I didn't watch the show while it was on HBO initially, but caught it streaming on amazon recently. i would have agitated for season 4. it is over 10 yrs old, so HBO will likely never finish it. there had been talk of 2 2hour films but it never happened. they owe it to us still. the show was nominated for and won several emmys, deservedly so. a must see unless the language, sex and violence is unacceptable to you.

Each actor perfectly suited to the charcter portrayed, giving unbeatable performance of that character, I don't see how any could be replaced. Ian Mcshanes performance in the portrayal of Gem owner Al Swearengen is pure genuis, with all others close in suit.

This series dose not hold back, it dose tell how savage the west was, How corrupt things may have been and also how you can't have law and order with out lawless and Chaos.

The Adults in us would enjoy this show b/c like any other good show you Enjoy the bad guys as much as you hate the good guys.

This is not a typical western I do think it dose show how it possably was.

You can compare the show with much of what gose on in life this day and age.
This show is not for the faint of heart it DOSE curse alot you hear sevral words over and over that it dose get rather stupid.

So the bottom line is this is a savage show done for the adults in all of us and not ment for the children nor the faint of heart.",1314057600,,913,3.9347826086956523

2541349,5,B000EULSR0,"Deadwood happens to be my second all-time favorite TV show, right behind Millennium. As a rapidly growing fan of Wild West cinema, I am mesmerized by the sharp revisionist approach that David Milch and company have taken. Guns are set aside as character, dialogue, and the look and feel of the gritty environment of the camp that's about to turn into a full-fledged town become the highlights of the show. The characters and their dialogue especially are what make this show. Seth Bullock, Al Swearengen, Calamity Jane, Doc Cochran, A.W. Merrick, Mr. Wu, and many others are memorable in their own right. The dialogue is some of the greatest I have ever heard on cable television. Modern-day Shakespeare becomes an untouchable art form.

When I bought the first season of Deadwood, I instantly fell in love with the entire show. Its high quality made me a fan. The second season is even better than the first, though with a couple of exceptions. For one thing, since there is a much bigger cast of characters in all twelve episodes, some characters don't get as much attention as others. I wish I saw a little more of Doc Cochran, Charlie Utter, Sol Star, Trixie, Jewel, and Hostetler. Also, William Bullock seemed to be the only character who seems unnecessary in the series. But then again, he IS loosely based on Bullock's actual biological son, so I'll give the creators credit for that.

Still, I can live with these minor flaws, as I truly believe that this is a brilliant second season. It's darker, grittier, wittier, and even more well-written than the first. In the end, however, I still love both seasons, though I give the second the slight edge. Now onwards to the third (and unfortunately the final) season.

2541356,5,B000EULSR0,"I'm fairly  new to Deadwood,  just finished season 2, waiting for 3.  I'll add to the chorus proclaiming this as one of the best things on TV ever. Be warned, though, that while season 1 was no ""stroll in the park"", season 2 is one of the darkest seasons I've ever seen on TV.

And not just emotionally dark.  Do you remember Apocalypse Now, how the film started sun-drenched and overly bright, and gradually the film's palette grew darker? Deadwood 2 feels very much like that.  Much more of this season is cast in darkness and shadow. Even the daylight outdoors scenes are darker than season 1.  And the mood and tone is incredibly dark.  Season 1 had more than its share of brutality.  Season 2 not only ramps up the brutality, but adds a lot of suffering to the mix.  There is pain in this season, to strip your heart like turpentine, and very little of joy.  The tonal darkness, the character's emotional darkness, and the coming political darkness all combine in a pretty harrowing fashion.

But there is transcendence and magnificence in abundance.  It continues as one of the most incandescent shows ever filmed, and all the lead actors from season 1 return in stellar fashion.  What is most striking in season 2 is how the women shine.  Mainly supporting players in season 1, Joanie, Jane, Trixie, Almah and Martha each have turns to truly shine in season 2, and they don't waste a minute of it.

It's profane, it's brutal, it's ugly, and it's best thing you've probably never seen.

Don't you dare start with season 2, but if you've seen season 1, don't dare stop now.  This is truly essential TV.

2541358,5,B000EULSR0,"This a wonderful and essential addition to the finest series on the Wild West that I have ever seen.  With the characters and situation established, the series really hits its stride in this season.  Swearengen and Bullock are the two principal characters, who after a brutal confrontation arrive at a kind of tactical alliance against other influences in the town and in favor of its development.  While they remain themselves as consistent characters, this introduces a shade of gray into the body politic, but their adversaries seem much much worse, from the mysterious Hearst to his strange henchman.

In terms of plot, the town is making big strides toward joining S. Dakota, but it is also becoming a major source of gold, attracting many fortune seekers and organizers.  To the credit of the writers and direction, what is happening in the maneuverings is not completely spelled out, leaving it to the viewer to piece it together over multiple viewings.  I find this a delightful thinking task to unravel the political machinations.  It also interests to search back to the real history - I discovered to my astonishment that most of the characters are based on historical figures, which I had assumed only made cameo appearences, like Wild Bill Hickock and Calamity Jane.  (Check out wikipedia in this regard.)  It got me to buy a bunch more books from Amazon, to learn more.  Of course, there is much that is added as fiction or is simply inaccurate, but it is stimulating and another layer that is extremely fun.

There is also much development of the secondary characters, such as a call girl, EB Farnum, or the doctor.  The actors are so good that they bring real pathos to the story.  Bullock's family is also a major theme, with his unloved wife and her son moving as representatives into the soul of the city.  There is tragedy and development, all realistic and tough.

I will watch these again and again.  HBO has accomplished a great new kind of narrative of the West.  Warmly recommended.",1277164800,,2007,4.821637426900585

2541368,5,B000EULSR0,"HBO in the early 2000s created a Golden Age for Television.  One of the shows in this golden age was Deadwood.  A Western based on the real town in the Dakotas is a work of  art.  Based partly on truth and mixed in with fiction, Seth Bullock comes to town to begin a business with his friend Sol Starr.  He soon finds himself up against an evil saloon proprietor named Al Swearengen.  In this season, Seth finally admits he loves Alma and discovers his wife has come to town at the same time.  He devotes himself to his wife and stepson and turns his back on Alma who is now pregnant with his child.  Al in the meantime is witnessing the changes in the camp such as the introduction of the telegraph.  Other characters are going through changes also.  Joanie Stubbs opens her own brothel and Sy Tolliver seems like a constant threat. A very good season of a great TV show.  Thank god for what HBO once was.",1242345600,,906,4.3017751479289945

2541383,5,B000EULSR0,"David Milch and Company struck a rich vein of creative ore with Season 1 of Deadwood: brilliant, profane, quirky, hilarious, unexpected and unique; and, Season 2 falls in stride to continue the tale of the lawless boom town full of the ambitious, the broken, the crazed and the lost, and to further Milch's exploration of themes both broad and intimate concerning how individuals behave, one to another, and how they organize themselves when there is no other ostensible organizing principle beyond greed but which, in reality, only masks the inherent and instinctive human desire for structure and family, albeit here, some mighty dysfunctional families at that.

Beginning with a brutal showdown fight between Bullock (Tim Olyphant) and Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) which is actually not a culmination but really the beginning of their close bonding as allies, Milch then takes the unprecedented step of side-tracking his magnificent and audience-popular central character Swearengen for several episodes to allow a fuller exploration of other characters and their relationships.  With the Boss down and out of action, the followers and hangers-on scramble in panic, indecision and vulnerability. Meanwhile we are introduced to new characters and themes, most notably the chilling psychopath Wolcott, and the aging and desperately mercenary Maddie, and following on the heels of all is the toweringly ruthless George Hearst, making his appearance finally at Season's end and debuting what will be an absolutely brilliant turn by Gerald McRaney that will continue and expand in Season 3.  This Season contains within it a tragedy and its aftermath that is handled with superb sensitivity and depicted with tact and understatement that I found very moving.

Deadwood would never be a series for a general audience, and I would recommend it soley to those whose tastes I know well.  It is not a Western, if your idea of Westerns are cowboy movies.  It is not reality, no more than the lives of English Kings are the reality of Shakespeare's plays.  The reality of Deadwood, as detailed in the DVD extras, is merely a starting place for the imaginative spell Milch weaves with character and dialogue and mood and atmosphere.  It is obvious there are many who are deaf, dumb and blind to the simple pleasures of droll dialogue, quirky asides and a convulted plot that many times finds numerous side trips and diversions on its way to often ambiguous conclusion.  So be it.

Deadwood is obviously not for all tastes, and delicate sensibilities need not apply.  It remains obsinately, brilliantly, profanely eloquent with difficult and flawed characters, priceless dialogue, and themes big and small for those who love it.  It wears its ecentricities proudly and it is a feast of terrific acting by a fine ensemble cast, in a marvelous set, that is lit, photographed and directed in a series that is superior to most films, let alone most television.

So what are licensed devices?  I own a 2.5 yr old Sony DVD player.  It's an expensive high end player, top of the line.  It's a Read/Write DVD and can also take VHS and convert it to DVD format.  But it doesn't want to recognize the discs.  HBO, you got something against Sony products?

Secondly, when I play the DVDs in my computer they work fine; however, you have to watch a 2 Minute HBO commercial everytime you insert a disk.  You can't stop it, nor can you go straight to the Menu.

What!?!  I shell out $80 for this set, and I can only play it on my small computer moniter?  And I have to watch a 2 Min commercial everytime I insert it?

HBO, don't you get it?  We want DVDs that play on all brands of DVD players, and we don't want to have to watch your 2 Minute Commercial everytime we insert a Disc.  That's crap, and that's the reason for 2 Stars only.

2541388,5,B000EULSR0,"David Milch's profane masterpiece, ""Deadwood,"" continues to demonstrate that HBO has mastered the art of the TV series.  Bloody, sexy, funny and sad, Season Two offers plenty of surprises for fans still thunderstruck from Season One.

Season Two opens about seven months or so after the close of the first season.  Sheriff Bullock (Tim Olyphant) and saloon-owner/prime mover-and-shaker Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) have settled into an uneasy alliance, but one as fragile and explosive as nitroglycerine.  A harsh look and some brash talk set these two at their throats in the very first episode.  It's no secret that Bullock's nerves are shot, as his affair with Alma Garrett (Molly Parker) is about to be terminated by the imminent arrival of his wife (Anna Gunn).

The various sub-plots of the camp continue to roil and seethe.  The continued prosperity of the camp has attracted the eyes of the outside world.  Montana and Dakota are jockeying to annex the camp for statehood, and Swearengen and Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) try to work the necessary angles to make sure they won't get lost in the shuffle.  George Hearst, the most successful and ruthless gold miner in the West, has sent his representative to scout out the town and use ruthless methods to acquire mining claims . . . and this representative is a ""specialist"" with the local prostitutes.  Trixie and Sol Starr continue their ""relationship.""  Doc continues his lonely war for the virtue of the camp.  There is even a battle for the alleys and shanties of the Chinese community in town. And Calamity Jane continues her struggles with the bottle and the death of her friend, Wild Bill Hickock.

This series is far to vast to be adequately summarized here.  Suffice it to say that ""Deadwood"" continues to offer some of the most colorful and insightful writing on TV, and the cast does an excellent job capturing the essence of frontier life in 19th century America in all its varied forms.

Several cast commentaries highlight various aspects of the show, including the actors' collective ignorance as to what is going on.  Aaron Sorkin was notorious for providing scripts to his actors that were still warm from the printer - David Milch does much the same here, but his scripts are much more complex and subtle.  There is also a great DVD extra showing how hard Milch actually works writing this stuff, lying on the floor reworking line after line of dialogue until it is just right.

Deadwood is a genre breaking western that cuts to the core of how the west was settled and won- and how what was won was often stolen by robber barons and corporations. In other words, you can learn a lot about how power really works and how the human spirit struggles and rises above it from watching this western.

On a pure story and character level Deadwood is one of the best made television series of all time. It takes a little getting used to the language and sometimes the violence, but it's worth it.

2541395,1,B000EULSR0,"""Deadwood"" does a good job of portraying how violent and depraved Western Civilization can be.  After slaughtering the Native people, or sending them off on forced marches, etc., people made a living scrambling around for gold in them thar' hills.  Same story in California and other places.  In fact, it's the same story today, where mining firms like Newmont (located in Denver) turn ecosystems of indigenous people into dead zones.  Once the local economies and ways of life are destroyed, people struggle to get by through working for the mining firms, or the lumber companies, or for the massive hydroelectric projects.  Corruption of politicians helps the projects go forward, oftentimes officials are seduced via sexual favors.  All this is exposed in ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Confessions-of-an-Economic-Hit-Man/dp/0452287081/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</a>&nbsp;by John Perkins.  Although, when someone reads a book by Perkins, or maybe ""Resource Rebels"" by Al Gedicks, there is nothing appealling about it.  ""Deadwood"" seems to try to normalize and even glamorize the worst of human behavior.

It's kind of sad to consider all of the youth, not just in this country, but around the world, who will view these DVDs and come away thinking that being a thug or a prostitute is the way to go.  The objectification of women and the crude language will be another regressive contribution toward our sick society.  There's a scene where a character says ""A lot of screaming comes from Al's room.""  Al is a character who some reviewers feel is likable.  That he sexually brutalizes and exploits women doesn't impress me.

The gun, tobacco and liquor industries must really appreciate all the product placement they receive in this series.  I imagine the directors probably received some bags of money for their efforts.

I guess I was hoping for something thoughtful and well-written like ""Northern Exposure""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Northern-Exposure-Seasons-1-3-Bundle/dp/B0009Q7IZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Northern Exposure - Seasons 1-3 Bundle</a>or ""Six Feet Under""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under-The-Complete-Series-Gift-Set/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set</a>.  Instead, just endless moments of depravity.  I guess it makes the violent and corrupt corporatists of today feel good about themselves and their role in the world, kind of like how ""The Sopranos"" celebrates the worst sort of human.

How people come to see this sort of thing as entertaining is beyond me.

Maybe I'm missing something, and I'll watch a few more episodes to see if something worthwhile comes from this show.  It all seems very negative to me, and it's kind of fitting that another reviewer expressed his anger over the show being cancelled by saying he wanted to ""put a bullet in the head of an HBO executive.""  That's exactly the sort of energy this show casts off - violence and aggression - along with deceit and greed.  The same is found in Shakespeare, which is probably why we're all supposed to worship him in Western Civilization; but writers like Rumi, Thich Nhat Hanh, Joseph Campbell and Alice Walker are more my speed.  If people are so fascinated by violence and corruption, they should check out the writings of William Blum.  I doubt his ""Killing Hope"" will be turned into a tv series, but at least people can feel a bit closer to the action since we invest our tax dollars in the bullets and cluster bombs.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killing-Hope-U-S-Military-and-CIA-Interventions-Since-World-War-II-Updated-Through-2003/dp/1567512526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II-Updated Through 2003</a>

My hope was to at least find this program bearable enough to use as a tool to study Spanish.

(There is a certain compound word employed to great effect by Al Swearengen, Calamity Jane, and Wu, which I can't use here, but the nuances applied by each elevates swearing to an art form).

Watching the show is still a lot of fun, but the show has drifted farther away from historical reality. For example, Francis Wolcott, Alma Garrett, and Cy Tolliver are all fictional characters with central roles in the HBO series. This coming season is Deadwood's third and last, which is probably about right.

The characters have taken on lives of their own, as they tend to do on any TV series, but this evolution presents a problem for an historically based drama. But what great, larger-than-life characters they are. And the last episode signs off with a Bob Wills tune.

I would strongly suggest that you watch the first season of Deadwood before you tackle the second one. There are a lot of characters and continuing plot lines.

I'm surprised that point hasn't been mentioned more, because it seems that Olyphant, on his episode commentaries, wasn't thrilled about it either, and I don't blame him. Bullock and Garrett had a wonderful chemistry that was just beginning to blossom, but it was nipped in the bud because of a certain family member showing up unannounced from way out of left field and throwing the series into an entirely less satisfying area, at least to me.

It feels like the writers and the actors have really settled into the skin of the characters and the setting. They speak and act wonderfully, each of them representing different areas of society, speaking differently depending on who they're speaking too, etc. Very well done.

This series is definitley worth the buy.  There aren't too many tv series that I would watch twice, but this is one of them.  I really hope they reconsider and decide to keep this series going.

2541417,4,B000EULSR0,"I've never seen ""Deadwood"" on TV, but I just watched Seasons 1 and 2 of the DVDs back to back. Season 1 is better, because it gives a much stronger sense of moral ambiguity. In Season 1, Al Swearengen is a brutal villain whose frequent response to problems is to have the person causing them killed and fed to a local butcher's pigs; or at least badly beaten up. But he occasionally does fine things for the wrong reasons. Like organizing (and paying handsomely for) a run for vaccine and an isolation tent to save Deadwood from a severe smallpox epidemic--because it would be bad for Swearengen's business.

In Season 2, Swearengen is more like a corporate executive--power hungry, manipulative, but with a soft inner side that causes him to do some very nice things that don't benefit him at all.  And, when he becomes bedridden from three serious physical problems at once (which seems excessive), everyone in the Gem, including his most brutal lackeys, the lame woman he habitually insults, the whores he beats up, etc., hang around misty-eyed for a long time (as far as the viewer is concerned) tearfully hoping for and promoting his recovery, while telling each other what a sweet guy he is.

Overall Season 2 slips into sentimentality, and into some obvious attempts to manipulate viewer emotions. There are a two episodes with a prolonged and tedious focus on a cute little boy, only to kill him off and have a pathetic funeral. Meanwhile, the Season 2 murders of three women by a Jack-the-Ripper counterpart, a fraternal murder for gain, a near-fatal shooting, and the deaths of a number of Chinese, go by like all the murders in Season 1--that is to say, just business as usual in Deadwood. Why is a child's death worth the better part of two episodes, and all the adult deaths are pretty much passed over?

The last episode, which frantically sets up several new story lines, apparently to hook viewers for Season 3, is too transparent. It is clear you are watching a TV show, and the feeling of being ""in"" Deadwood is lost. Likewise, the sudden discovery/revelation of a secret passage between the Gem Saloon and the newspaper office is just too much.

Season 2 isn't bad, but it has definitely lost some of its edge compared to Season 1. It does have the same beautiful visuals as Season 1, and it's hard not to be curious about the stories of compelling characters (even if the characters have been changed somewhat).

Powers Booth proves an excellent foil for Ian McShane's brilliance, but the ""heart"" of the first year was missing.  Maybe due to the change in writers.  It finally gathered it's writs and original writers and went back to it's utter brilliance in the final episodes.  You can see this is overall feel, because it was ignored in the Emmy nominations.  Still, it's well worth the price.  Great to be able to watch season 1 & 2 seamlessly.

Good news:  Second three is absolutely breathtakingly hypnotic.  McShane continues to dance up on the highwire, but now had to perfect adversary in the wonderfully evil Hurst.  So bring on three.  Bad News:  HBO has cancelled one of the best works ever to be on HBO.

2541426,4,B000EULSR0,"Season Two shifts the ""Deadwood"" motor into a somewhat different gear.

It moves slowly at first -- so slowly that I nearly cried ""sophomore slump"" and gave up on it. But before I realized it, by about the fourth episode, the show was achieving and in some ways eclipsing the heights of the first season.

In this second installment, the town is growing, attracting more and more attention from the government and from the diabolically pragmatic prospector George Hearst. The characters, demonstrating a variation on ""nobody beats up my brother but me,"" begin to bond together in a reassuring way, and it's amusing to see Bullock and Swearengen (who nearly beat each other to death in episode one) form a strange kind of bond by the end.

But don't foster any illusions that ""Deadwood"" gets warm and snuggly in its second season. If anything, the depiction of corruption and just plain old ickiness is even more pronounced. A running plot about Swearengen's agonized attempts to pass a kidney stone is one of the most excruciating situations I've ever seen depicted in series television; and in a weird way it's also one of the funniest.

This is a show that's built solidly on its ensemble and there are so many great character actors (playing great characters) that it's hard to know where to start. Everybody's uniformly convincing and unique.

If I had to pick two of the supporting cast, though, I'd start with Garret Dillahunt, who plays Wolcott, Hearst's geologist who brings to town both ""corporate"" corruption and his own psychotic tendencies. It's ironic that Dillahunt later played a stoner Jesus on the now-cancelled ""The Book of Daniel,"" because here he's basically the devil. His Wolcott is a cold, chilling, self-accepting performance that would've been astonishing even if Dillahunt hadn't earlier played a completely different kind of character on the show -- he was Jack McCall, who killed Bill in the first season -- but is completely unrecognizable in the new role.

Robin Weigert -- wriggling deeper into the character of the endlessly irritable, perpetually inebriated Calamity Jane -- is also pretty amazing. I don't think she gets as much credit as she should, probably because what she's doing is so assured it almost doesn't seem like acting. Her quirks and personality as so well defined by Weigert, and so strangely endearing, that I think she fools viewers into thinking what she's doing is easy, but it can't possibly be.

But the undeniable hub of the show is Ian McShane as Swearengen, who channels both Snidely Whiplash and Orson Welles and makes a complete [...] somehow likeable; and the rich, complex writing and plotting, which show no signs of flagging --the season finale, for example, pays off like a slot machine in its final moments and is one of my favorite episodes of TV, ever.",1154131200,7,2822,4.940928270042194

The 2nd season is drags a bit and along with the profanity, there is much flowery westernese Shakespearian speech that if one does not listen closely; one will not understand what the heck they just said.

Swearingen', that ol' villain of the Gem Saloon.  He built up quite a reputation as a vile  evil murderer in the 1st season who would just as soon stick a knife in a visitor's guts as well as shake their hand, depending upon his mood.  He evolves quickly in the 2nd season into a cantankerous, yet grudgingly lovable character one would not mind having for an odd black sheep uncle.

The real Swearingen, if the ""Real Deadwood"" sites are to be believed, beat his prostitutes frequently. He lured young women into the business from distant places with promises of stardom and if they failed to live up to carnal expectations, were kicked out into the street to starve. Perhaps such wickedness is just a little too wicked for a major character, even a reprobate one.

The funeral episode seemed a little forced. This is a town where, when most folks die, get dumped into a Chinese hog pen, and no one seems to notice. The newly arrived Bullock kid is around for a couple of episodes, gets stomped by a horse and everybody cannot help but NOTICE (maybe there was some unseen 11 episodes off screen or not on the DVDs where the Bullock kid went around and became well known and beloved by the entire town). People were coming out of the brothels, the mines, woodworks and waterworks to come to this funeral. I did find, though, scripture readings and the grieving mother scene where she changes her mind about the viewing, rather touching.

The wedding episode was comical towards the end and perhaps even ""camp."" This was the season finale of the 12 episode series and it seemed a rush to tidy everything up. In one scene as the camera focus was on a couple of main characters discoursing, a brief second or so, entirely unnoticed by our main characters, almost off screen and to the side, a man is dropped out of a window to hang violently from the end of a rope.  Another glimpse of this dangling person is seen later on, and I presume it is a quick plot device to dispose of one of the series razor villains without wasting a potentially interesting future episode on him.

2541432,5,B000EULSR0,"In season two, ""Deadwood"" gains the courage of its own convictions and starts to explore the world it's created with even greater power and subtlety than it did in season one. Truly magnificent TV, downright Shakespearean. In fact, Swearingen's growing habit in this season of addressing his privatemost thoughts to a box with the Injun chief's head in it reminds one of Iago's or Macbeth's soliloquies. Cy Tolliver also shows how mesmerizing a truly vicious man can be. Both Ian McShane as Swearingen and Powers Booth as Tolliver are snarlingly brilliant. And Molly Parker really grows into the role of the widow Alma Garrett, as she perfectly balances innocence, passion, playfulness, and restraint.

Other actors who deserve special mention are Brad Dourif as the cranky, principled Doc Cochran, and William Sanderson, whose portrayal of E.B. Farnum is deliciously histrionic.

The language in ""Deadwood"" is one of its great achievements. The over-the-top profanity conceals other purposes. It makes the characters seem gritty and almost primitive. At the same time, they can handle the elaborate periodic sentence along with the quickest witted of Shakespeare's characters or those of the other classic author I'm put in mind of: Dickens. What a seductive, baroque smorgasbord of effects creator and executive producer David Milch serves up here! I'm awestruck and eagerly awaiting the DVD of season three.

I'm also devastated and mystified that HBO has canceled this fabulous show. My vote's with the ""savedeadwood"" movement, but I fear it has little chance of success.",1153008000,2,1575,5.317269076305221

2541439,5,B000EULSR0,"Ian McShane certainly steals this ensemble Western.  His cunning and ruthlessness are believable.

Big Al doesn't mind messing with an employee now and then, cruelly testing a bartender or working girl. Though he surrounds himself with cutthroats and moneygrubbers, one is never sure that the end game for Al is just gold.

The writing, the dialogue of Deadwood seems to come out of a Victorian novel.  There's hints of Shakespearean history plays, say Henry V in the witty repartee and double entendre's that whirl about complicated plots and sub-plots inferring a visceral grasp for mastery or survival. The legends of the dime story are pranced about the saloons of Deadwood, Wild Bill Hitchcock or Calamity Jane.  Timothy Olyphant plays a Wyatt Earp type sheriff and businessman, a figure of virtue; yet, as all the characters in Deadwood, Olyphant is not above adultery or vengeance murder, nor does he over think allegiances with cold blooded gangsters like Ian McShane.

Here is the POST-MODERN revision of Western history as it is taught by Humanities Departments of our major Universities to our slack-jawed children.  You see kids.  This was how America was built.  Capitalism and murder go hand in hand. You see?

2541444,5,B000EULSR0,"This is a review of the Season 2 package being offered by HBO.  As to the series, if you have watched Deadwood, then like most viewers, you either love it or hate it.  For some, the language and violence are insurmountable obstacles for enjoyment.  For others, the air of realism and authenticity, even with an anachronistic swearing vocabulary, make the show excellent.  Rather than review the show itself, let me take a moment to review this particular DVD package.  To begin with, the packaging itself is rather appealing.  The hard-cover box with the folio carrier for the DVDs looks nice on the shelf and is very durable and protective of the discs.  The transfers on all 12 episodes are excellent quality, typical of HBO and the audio is some of the best quality I've seen on DVD versions.  Deadwood relies heavily on acoustic music which is very well soundtracked to these discs.  The extras include audio commentary on 9 episodes and unlike many shows, the audio commentaries come from a wide variety of cast and crew members. Based on what is included in some series' you would expect commentary from Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant, and David Milch on every episode.  In this case, you hear from 13 different members of the cast and crew which adds a great deal of insight into the actors' and producers' viewpoints on this compelling drama.  As in the first season package, there is a feature on the real 1877 Deadwood and also a ""making of"" surrounding the season finale.  The package includes English, French, and Spanish audio versions in Dolby and surround.  Overall, this is a very well-made DVD package with some truly nice added features.  If you just want to re-experience the second sesason of the show, it is well worth the purchase price.  But the commentaries and other features certainly add a great deal of value.  Kudos to HBO on giving the buyer something far more than what can be captured with Tivo.",1151280000,2,1926,4.7734138972809665
2541445,5,B000EULSR0,"I want to start this review with this. I've never liked westerns that much. I've never seen ""Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid"" or ""Dances With Wolves"".

I liked ""Open Range"" but that's about as far as it goes. I started watching ""Deadwood"" when a friend recommended it. I started watching the first season via rental about two weeks before this season came out on DVD. After about 5 episodes of the first season I was hooked. This show is so good and there are so many good things about it. The dialogue is great, the action riveting, the characters are well drawn out and even the most evil characters you can't help but like. A lot of people associate ""Deadwood"" with ""that western show with lots of cussing."" Yes, there is a lot of cussing in this show and it works perfectly. The show is also very real; You'll never see a character wearing Nikes and the woman all have armpit hair. It's realistic, even when you don't want it to be. In the second season, older characters return and new characters come in. We even have an actor from the first season come back and play a different character. First off, I try to spare as many details as possible about episodes in my review because I feel it's best to watch the show without a preconceived notion of what's going to happen, but I'll give you a brief and to the point synopsis before giving my thoughts on each episode. In the first episode we see the return of Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert, who's really a talented actress who I look forward to seeing in movies after the third-and sadly last-season of Deadwood ends). We also get to witness a bloody and entertaining fight between saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane, who would win the Best Actor Oscar if this was a movie easily) and sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olymphant). We also see Joanie Stubbs, the former hooker of The Bella Union temporarily open up her own brothel. Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe, who gives a great supporting performance and is very good at playing unstable characters) owner of The Bella Union is even worse off in this season in first. Whore Trixie becomes more of a lead character as she begins working in Bullock's hardware store alongside Sol Star (John Hawkes). Alma Garrett, still raising the young child Sofia, forms a sexual relationship with Bullock right as his wife & son show up. Also, Swearengen who was established as a thoroughly evil character in the first season turns out to be a pretty good guy this season while maintaining his nastiness. Anyway, this season (I think) is very superior to the first season...Except it'll spend as many as three episodes on one subject (urinary infections, death, etc.). All the actors are getting used to their roles and are almost becoming real people. As for the complaint that the same actor who played Jack McCall is now playing Francis Wolcott, I hardly noticed at first. It's obvious it's him, but it's not bothersome. The guy seems to be a character actor who can float in and out of episodes. Here are the episodes and my thoughs, but my final comment is...If you love westerns or have already watched ""Deadwood"" and love it. Buy this damned DVD set.

1. A Lie Agreed Upon Pt. 1-An explosive opener for the season. The best episode I've seen of Deadwood so far. There's a great sex scene between Seth Bullock & Alma Garret; There's a great fight scene between Seth Bullock & Al Swearengen; There's a great return of Calamity Jane, that keeps true to her characters. The dialogue is so good, this is really a spectacular episode.

2. A Lie Agreed Upon Pt. 2-Ian McShane is such an amazing actor. Al Swearengen is a terrific character who's got near perfect dialogue. Another great episode.

3. New Money-This episode, for the most part, centers around a bladder problem Swearengen is having...These scenes where the doc has to remove stones and such from his bladder are painful to watch. Oh and P.S., why is the actor that played Jack McCall back in the show as a guy named Wolcott? He's not bad, but they could've gotten someone else.

4. Requiem for a Gleet-Again, scenes involving Swearengen's bladder infection are painful to watch. Everytime Wu comes into The Gem though, it's pretty funny. Stephen Toblowsky (from ""Memento"") guest stars.

5. Complications (Formerly Difficulties)-5/5-This is my favorite episode of 'Deadwood' out of the ones so far. The dialogue in this episode is very witty and well written. I like the Calamity Jane character more & more with every episode.

6. Something Very Expensive-This episode is very intense and you find out that Wolcott is worse than Swearengen. It shows that the show is ready to go in a different direction.

7. EB Was Left Out-This episode isn't my favorite, but the scene where Charlie Utter beats up Wolcott was very cool.

8. Childish Things-This is one of the shortest episodes (48 minutes). I love the line Swearengen says to that teacher chick ""Thank you for brushing against my prick.""

This episode is really good and introduces a Russian telegraph operator.

9. Amalgation & Capital-A tragic event occurs. The score and the sequence of events leading up to this event (as well as the camera work) make this one of the saddest & most effective episodes.

10. Advances, None Miraculous-This episode pretty much revolves around the tragedy that occured in the previous episode. It's pretty good, I guess.

11. The Whores Can Come-While one can come up with all sorts of innuendo for this episode's title, it's not what you think. This episode is about the funeral of the person who died in the last episode. This one has it's moments, but overall is probably the weakest episode this season.

12. Boy The Earth Talks To-This is a great season finale that leaves you cheering for the characters and waiting for the next season.

GRADE: A+

P.S.,

I want to add that I'm happy the writers of the show decided to make the character of Mr. Wu bigger. He was in the first season for a few moments, but left such an impression and made me laugh so hard. I'm pleased to see him back.",1150329600,5,6036,4.684608120868744
2541446,5,B000EULSR0,"Incredibly, HBO keeps renewing the Sopraos while it grows ever more plodding and irrelevant, yet they cancel Deadwood, which is probably the best piece of programming they have EVER had.

The Sopranos big story line this year?  The same as everyone else: somebody is gay.  Big whoop, big surprise.  Let's face it, it's tired unto death.  Both the idea and the show.

Deadwood, however, is brilliantly written, acted and executed.  The language is coarse as a steel-wool pad, but that's one of the things that makes this so astonishing.  Despite it's vulgarity, the dialogue is used to near poetic effect.

The character of Al Swearingen is so complex as to be almost incomprehensible: always concerned with his personal bottom line, one moment brutal and carnal, then next tender and compassionate, then suddenly concerned with the welfare of the assorted denizens of this sewer of a camp.  Strangly, like all humans, it all seems to make sense once we become aware of the over-arching motivations that become revealed during the course of the season.

Seth Bullock is, as always, a walking volcano of contradiction.  Struggling to make his way in a vile locale, hoping to make life better, yet beset with a constantly simmering nitroglycerine laced temper that explodes on occasion.  I've never seen a actor who can convey barely controlled rage the way Olliphant can.

Add the other brilliant actors, all given suberb dialogue, and a plot that constantly throws curves your way (much as real life will) and you have a superb drama.

Yet HBO killed it and renewed the slogging Sopranos.

What were they thinking?  Maybe they had too many cannolis and were asleep at the switch.  Or maybe it's all about what it is always about: $$.",1150329600,9,1732,4.913793103448276
2541447,5,B000EULSR0,"The second season of HBO's ""Deadwood"" required some adjustments on the part of viewers because it was more of the same, only different.  The key dynamic of the first season was the arrival of Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) in Deadwood, intending to be a merchant opening a hardware franchise with his friend Sol Star (John Hawkes), but in the wake of the murder of Wild Bill Hickok ending up taking over the duties of sheriff from the inept Con Stapleton (Peter Jason).  The big question was what the assumption of this responsibility would do to his uneasy relationship with Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), the proprietor of the Gem Saloon and unofficial master of Deadwood.  However, Bullock's high and mighty attitude is at odds with his behavior with the widow Alma Garrett (Molly Barker), a hypocrisy that Swearengen will try to exploit.

Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the second season is how quickly creator David Milch reverses the two key relationships that help define Bullock.  In the premier episode of the season, ""A Lie Agreed Upon, Part 1,"" Swearengen rides Bullock about his affair with Alma and the two ends up in a vicious fight that sends them off the balcony of the Gem to land hard in the streets, just as Bullock's wife, Martha (Anna Gunn), his brother's widow, and her son, William (Josh Eriksson) arrive on the stage.  Bullock has a broken nose and Swearengen broken ribs, and while both are temporarily out of action everybody in Deadwood assumes they are going to finish what they started.  In ""A Lie Agreed Upon, Part 2"" there is a great effort by his friends to keep Bullock from going back to the Gem to get his badge and gun, which he removed before the fistfight. But when Bullock calls Swearengen out, his badge and gun are returned to him, along with an apology from Al.  Suddenly, Bullock and Swearengen are on the same side, with the interest of the camp at heart.

Meanwhile, the arrival of his wife and stepson have ended Bullock's affair with the widow Garrett, and from the intimacy of their last tryst in her hotel room a curtain of formality drops between them.  The only problem is that they are still enamored of each other and she turns out to be pregnant with his child, and being pregnant and unmarried is an unacceptable situation for a Victorian woman.  This change of affairs now puts the relationship between Sol and the prostitute Trixie (Paula Malcomson) into the forefront of the show on the romantic front, since the idea that Ellsworth (Jim Beaver) would propose to Alma to give her situation the appropriate cover of legitimacy, is not exactly a love story.  But then ""Deadwood"" was never exactly a romance.

More importantly the politics and economics of the town are now in flux.  The arrival of a county commissioner from Yankton and the question of whether Deadwood would remain part of the Dakota Territory or become part of the Montana Territory, has Swearengen trying to play both sides to his advantage.  But politicians might be the least of Al's worries, as Francis Wolcott (Garret Dillahunt), agent for the mining magnate George Hearst (Gerald McRaney), arrives in town.  The plan is to make people think that the government is going to disallow claims, so that Wolcott can buy them cheap for Hearst, and Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) and E.B. Farnum (William Sanderson) are enlisted in this cause.  However, Wolcott's predilection for cutting the throats of prostitutes who look at him when he does not want to be looked at, makes him an even bigger wild card.

Things are changing quickly in Deadwood, but what stands out in this second season are the points where the action slows down and memorable episodes focus on Doc Cochran (Brad Dourif) trying to remove a kidney stone from Al (""New Money"") or the entire camp waiting for a injured child to die (""Advances None Miraculous"").  I also find it quite interesting that Joanie Stubbs (Kim Dickens) becomes the conscience of the town as she breaks from Tolliver and the Bella Union to open up her own brothel, Chez Ami.  That this would make Joanie and Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) kindred spirits of a type is not surprising since the two women better represent the spirit of Deadwood than the likes of high class ladies like Alma and Martha (and with Trixie ministering to Al instead of looking out for Sofia, who is now with Alma, the spot is open for grabs)  The shifting shades of community become one of the most compelling aspects of ""Deadwood"" as the pieces on the chessboard get rearranged and the game develops.  There is more than constant swearing and great acting at work here.

The audio commentaries are a mixed bag, but there are enough insights to make them worth listening to.  The final disc offers the most interesting bonus features, beginning with a featurette on ""The Real Deadwood 1877"" that allows historians to hold sway.  Then there are three looks at the ""Making of Season 2 Finale: Boy-the-Earth-Talks-To.""  The first ""Trusting the process with David Milch"" looks at how the show's creator works, whether lying on the floor of his office writing, rewriting, and rewriting again dialogue, or giving his actors background on a scene so they might have a chance of understanding some of what they are saying.  ""Mr. Wu Proves Out"" focuses on the staging of some key scenes, but the highlight becomes when actor Keone Young says to Milch that one day Wu should cut off his queue and Milch gets all excited and says they should do it this season (which they do, as We learns another word of English).  ""The Wedding Celebration"" is basically teaching the cast to dance for the big finale.  There is also a collection of ""Deadwood Daguerreotypes,"" with both historical photographs of the town and posed color portraits of some of the cast.",1150329600,5,5785,4.785929648241206
2541448,4,B000EULSR0,"I loved season one, but it took me a while to watch all the episodes. Season two, however, I tore through rather quickly. That probably says it all: once you get into Deadwood, you can't stop. The story arch for season two concerns whether Deadwood will remain an ""outlaw"" camp or be incorporated into the Dakota or Montana territories. As complicated political and financial deals are being made right and left, the town makes some effort to become legitimate. The slimy hotel owner E. B. Farnum becomes ""mayor,"" and various town officials are appointed. If Deadwood's inhabitants make some attempts at becoming ""civilized,"" that doesn't prevent the bodies from piling up. Season two is just as bloody as season one. Things also get complicated when Sheriff Bullock's wife and adopted son show up announced. Subplots abound, such as Al Swearengen's medical woes, the battle between Woo and the ""San Francisco C---sucker,"" and a psychopath named Wolcott who works for a gold mining magnate who is interested in getting a piece of the action in Deadwood. Got all that? Season two is very good, though it lacks a bit of the first season's freshness, and none of the second season characters are as good as those introduced in season one. I was also disappointed that the show continues to insist on including artificial-sounding and unnecessary four, ten, and twelve-letter words, which bears little resemblence to how people actually talked in 1877. But, now that the show has established itself as profane, it can't cut back on the swearing without later shows seeming inconsistent. I was happy to see that in season two, Calamity Jane does more than just act as the town drunk, a role she held firm toward the end of season one and most of season two. I was also happy to see some black characters finally show up in Deadwood, but it looks as if they won't end up staying long. Although season two gets Byzantine at times, it is a worthy follow-up to season one. Deadwood remains a character actor's heaven, with the great Stephen Topolowsky showing up in season two as a corrupt Dakota commissioner. Ian McShane's Al Swearengen remains the show's centerpiece; when he falls ill and must remain in bed for much of season two, we miss him. He is Deadwood's Darth Vader--an evil man who seems to be going away from the dark side a bit as time goes by. I'll be interested to see what happens in season three.",1150156800,3,2406,4.772182254196642
2541449,5,B000EULSR0,"I wish I could be as eloquent as the reviewers who wrote expressing their displeasure about the possible ending of the series either after this season or the next. I felt that there were two choices to make. One was to be disappointed at not being able to see this series develop and the other to be grateful for what we have received. Speaking for myself, I chose the second option. Having watched and owned both of the first two seasons and am eagerly awaiting the new season starting tonight I can only feel gratitude for the most compelling, intelligent, humane (you got that right), and perceptive television that I have ever had the privilege to watch. If it ends here I will still be grateful and will watch the DVD's of this wonderful series over and over again. They get richer with each reviewing. I will miss it greatly. Deadwood also means a lot to me since I live in central Montana and all too often I don't have to visualize what happened in Deadwood in those times. We aleady have a living museum.

 I have never had HBO before and realize now how much quality programming I have missed. Not having HBO was probably one of the main reasons I rarely watch television--except for the Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and The Mind of Mencia. I haven't seen even one episode of the Sopranos although I did order the DVD's for the first season. That's why Deadwood was such a wonderful revelation and,again, speaking only for myself, I am happy that HBO produced 3 seasons of Deadwood. I would feel like an ingrate if I boycotted them for not continuing it.",1149984000,3,1567,4.53356890459364
2541450,3,B000EULSR0,"When i started to watch the second season of Deadwood today i learned to my bitter disappointment that each disk is formatted so that you have to watch several minutes of HBO commercials before you can watch Deadwood.  There is NOTHING you can do about it except watch unless you turn down the sound and go do something else for several minutes.

Heretofore on every DVD i have bought it has at least been possible to fast forward through the commercials.  Hereafter i will investigate and if any other DVD's, HBO's or anybody else's, are set up the way the Deadwood set is I won't buy them.  I did not pay $62.96 to put up with that kind of stuff. Sheesh!

2541451,5,B000EULSR0,"Here in Oregon, we have a reputable Shakespeare company in Ashland, and my wife and I make annual pilgrimages to see the latest productions.

I mention this autobiographical trivia because I couldn't put my finger on why DEADWOOD seemed so familiar to me. It was not because I've seen westerns before, because DEADWOOD is profoundly different from any western that's ever been made.

And then I realized it: This is the equivalent of modern-day Shakespeare.

Lest the good reader think I am overreaching, let's review DEADWOOD's merits: Layered storylines, exemplary casting and acting, pathos and comedy, gritty realism... but most importantly, the language, my God, the LANGUAGE!

Much has been made of DEADWOOD's incredibly salty lingo, but I think discourses on the show's profanity unfairly overshadow the fact that the lines these characters deliver are pure gold. In Deadwood, conversations are masterful displays of timing and wit, and even lowly characters like Farnum get delicious speeches that plumb their souls, please our ears, and stir us if we are willing to listen.

2541452,4,B000EULSR0,"As a dyed-in-the-wool Deadwood fan I continue to think Deadwood is one of the most brilliant period pieces ever done for this era. It would be difficult to conceive of better set design, costume, dialogue, or character development than Milch does it. That having been said, I didn't think season two quite rose to the level of season one but then season one set a pretty high bar. The story kinds of drags in places. But I will also say they do a stellar job of wrapping up the season in episode 12. Season two's concluding episode was better than season one, and Al's last line, standing up on the porch, watching Bullock wander back down the street, is absolutely priceless! Season one and season two of Deadwood are both imminently watchable, however, and worth buying. A great series but not appropriate for kids. If you've never seen Deadwood, you'll never look at Pork the same way again once you see Wu's pigs, either.....(real Deadwood fans are laughing right now)",1149120000,6,972,4.723529411764706
2541453,5,B000EULSR0,"Hard to add much to the reviews here. The series deserves more credit than it gets for every aspect of its process and result. So to paraphrase Al, let me again emphasize the pure delight experienced in witnessing such stunningly adept use of the English language -- showstruck fool as I am.  If words and naming once held terrifying power, David Milch has gone a long way to restoring their elemental force. At turns ethereal and Shakespearean, at turns brutal and colloquial, ""Deadwood"" speaks in that singular tongue born in and borne by the mouth. Harder then to understand how those who deride the series for its language do not comprehend the fact that, in complete ignorance, they attack its greatest strength. My advice to those few that just don't get it is simple: If you don't have the time to watch, listen.",1148947200,6,819,4.7272727272727275
2541454,5,B000EULSR0,"With the third season of ""Deadwood"" being the last let's hope that creator/writer/producer/director David Milch can tie up all the loose ends to the series that he set up during season two. The second season of ""Deadwood"" starts with a tussle--Sheriff Seth Bollock (Timothy Olyphant) takes on Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) in a nasty, bloody fight when Swearengen insults Alma Garret (Molly Parker) in front of the residents of the town. Bollock's affair with Garret takes an unexpected turn when Bollock's wife (also the widow of his brother)and step son(also his nephew) arrive in town unexpectantly. Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) and Al increasingly come into conflict over their rival whorehouse business and a sociopath, ruthless mining agent (Garret Dillahunt) who works for George Hearst changes the life of whorehouse owners Maddie (Alice Krige) and Joanie (Kim Dickens) when he begins frequenting their business.

All of this happens in just the first episode of season two! Things will get worse before they get better for most of the residents of Deadwood as prospectors continue to pour into the mineral rich town.

Once again dominated by marvelous, stunning performances particularly from McShane, Olyphant, Boothe, Robin Weigert (as Calamity Jane) and Paula Malcomson (Trixie) the second season of ""Deadwood"" lacks the shock value of the first but the plotting, direction and writing are equally as good with sharper character development for the main characters. There isn't a weak link in this stunning cast (I mentioned the above members of the cast only because they had more than one stand out episode) and ""Deadwood"" is what ""The Sopranos"" used to be--cutting edge TV without regrets. David Milch's combination of drama and history is stunning looking with its rich production design and authentic characterizations.

A truly stunning transfer ""Deadwood"" is easily a DVD reference standard with deep, rich blacks almost nonexistent digital artifacts and rich, deep colors that capture the authentic rustic look of the show. The 5.1 soundtrack makes excellent use of the surround channels and dialogue is crystal clear. Part of the quality is due to the fact there are never more than 3 episodes per disc allowing plenty of bit space for the visual and audio elements but that also contributes to the cost of the set as well. You're getting and paying for quality with these sets. There are chapter placements after the opening titles of each episode which is a big plus for those fans who want to skip ahead.

We get a number of commentary tracks from the actors and writer/producer David Milch and director-producer Greg Feinberg. Among the best commentary tracks is the one on ""A Lie Agreed Upon Part I"" with actors Ian McShane and timothy Olyphant. The two clearly enjoy each other's company and have an infectious blast discussing the making of the episode. Actresses Molly Parker and Anna Gunn provide a second commentary track on the same episode and while it isn't as fun as McShane and Olyphant it is full of insight about the show and the episode. The other highlight are the two commentary tracks on  ""The Whores Can Come"" which features Olymphant paired with Gunn and McShane with Malcomson. It generates much of the same fun and informative atmosphere that dominates the commentaries on the opening episode. There are 7 other commentary tracks each quite good but none can really compare to these two. Even producer/writer David Milch's commentary lacks the firepower and fun atmosphere of these two commentary tracks with his being amount the least involving of the 9 included here.

The last disc like the first set has the featurettes. ""The Real Deadwood 1977-Historical Featurette"" is a companion piece to the first season featurette on the history of the town. We get a nice mix of historians, Milch and other production staff discussing the real vs. fictional world. ""Making of Episode 12: Boy-the-Earth Talks-To"" is a three part documentary about the making of the 12th episode of the season. ""Trusting the Process with David Milch"" allows us into the creative process as we watch Milch at work crafting the one of the episodes. ""Mr. Wu Proves Out"" details the subplot involving Wu and Swearengen and their complex relationship. ""The Wedding Celebration"" details the intricate planning that goes into the a wedding that is a highlight of the season finale. We also get a photo gallery of the characters and real Deadwood. There's also some HBO previews at the beginning of the first disc.

While the shock and uniqueness that highlighted the first season are gone the second season carries on with a series of brilliantly written and performed episodes. The characters are richer during the second season and the plot twists as convoluted as can be imagined making season two equally as good if not better than the first season of the show. The extras are generous given that this is a cable show being brought to DVD and the packaging/transfer is deluxe as well. Highly recommended.",1148774400,15,5019,5.061668681983071
2541455,5,B000EULSR0,"I reviewed the first season of Deadwood and hailed it as the saving grace of television. Season 2 continues with the same intensity but with more ""oomph"".

From the 1st episode right to the 12th, the writers give us a story that never fails to excite and invoke emotion. While in Season 1, events happen on a more personal level...now changes happen that involves the camp as a whole. Deadwood's vast gold resources draws the interest of many people of power. Several districts are vying for Deadwood to be under their territory, namely Yankton. Al Swearengen makes a pact with the sheriff, Seth Bullock and manipulates the situation to his benefit, so that he doesn't lose control to a government consisting of unknown poeple who will take advantage of the riches Deadwood has to offer. Gold mining is big business now, complete with massive equipment. Millionaire investor, George Hearst sends his agent, Francis Wolcott to buy claims of the gold from the hoopleheads to expand his investment. Wolcott allies with Tolliver to help him secure the gold claims. Joanie Stubbs, once working with Tolliver starts her own brothel with an acquaintance of hers, Maddie. Seth's wife and child joins him in Deadwood. Alma Garret is busy working her gold claim through Ellsworth. She is in love with Seth Bullock, and vice versa but responsibilities keep them from being together. If you think that's a lot to digest, it's just the icing on a cake. Many other things happen along the way, and it just makes you starve for more.

The writing is flawless as usual. The story is great and there's no wasting time. It goes straight to the point that the writers intend to make, and they drive it through like nails. Changes are risky but fortunately, the way they are implemented here is superb and very gradual...so it doesn't seem fake or preconceived. For example, where previously the people of Deadwood got what they want through brute force, now there are more negotiations, partly because the playing field is larger due to outside interests. It's amazing that the flow of the story is very natural, as well as the continuity. The acting is also top notch. Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant, Molly Parker and basically everyone in the show give award-worthy performances.

In short, another fantastic season of Deadwood and the pace of the series shows no signs of slowing down. Where Season 1 introduced us to the characters of Deadwood, that we have since come to love...Season 2 expands the story to a whole new level. And another thing I love about the show is that amidst the violence, greed and back-stabbing that occurs around camp, there is a certain degree of sanctity preserved that gives you a sense of pride for the town. This is an excellent season and I hope to see at least 2 or 3 more seasons of Deadwood. Keep up the good job!",1148774400,7,2833,4.777551020408163
2541456,5,B000EULSR0,Deadwood is to me one of the best shows there is on all of television the dialouge coupled with the amazing scenery and great acting makes this show special.  I loved the first season of Deadwood and could not wait for the second to run on HBO and have waited almost a year as all of you have too for this to come to DVD.  Ian Mcshane is masterful from beginning to end.  I would only say the obvious if you liked the first season of Deadwood you won't be disappointed if you have never watched the show before just go out and pick up season 1 and 2 and enjoy.,1148688000,4,560,4.027027027027027
2541457,5,B000EULSR0,"The only reason I keep HBO around is to watch Deadwood.

Some have complained about the adult language used and the violence, but it's a show based in fact, and it's a show about a mining camp.  If you're put off by a little cursing, this probably isn't the show for you.

But if you enjoy a well written, well acted show that has more than a touch of historical truth to it--most of the characters were actual people--I can highly recommend Deadwood.",1148688000,2,451,4.409638554216867
2541458,2,B000EULSR0,"It seems a lot of people just can't understand why this show is getting cancelled.  Simple.  There's no story left to tell.  What do you expect to happen from here?  Promo for the next season:  some more griping about whose jurisdiction the town falls under, A LOT more cursing, and somebody gets shot.  Plus they'll say ""thoroughfare"" about a million more times and talk like they're reading from a script.  Wow, impressive.  Yes, you heard it here first!",1148601600,2,456,4.756410256410256
2541459,3,B000EULSR0,"First season was awesome.  I watched it three times.  This season is not so good.  Why is the actor who played Jack McCall back with a beard on his face?  It's so obviously him that it ruins the new character.  This guy must be the producer's brother-in-law or something to come back as another person.  Lame.  Also the dialog in this season is jacked.  Put away the thesaurus, writers, and let people talk normal.  Half the time, it sounds like Mrs. Garrett slept with a subliminal ""vocabulary builder"" cassette playing in her headphones.  Another problem with this season is so many people are out of character.  Trixie can't say a line without the F word when she wasn't like that before.  Just listen and you've got to admit it sounds stupid, like a seventh-grader when he's learning to curse but can't do it the right way.  I'm a fan of dirty language and all, but I gotta laugh at some of these actors.  And what's with the overdubbed audio scenes where you hear a character talking like a narrator?  I think that takes away from the realism which the first season had.  Swearengen and his crew are still interesting, but I'm tired of the same old Bullock.  He doesn't look tough, makes tempermental, hasty decisions that would have buried him long ago, and I just can't buy him as the Mike Tyson of his day.  Maybe a gunfighter, but they don't make him out to be that.  I read what some others have said, that the actors contracts have not been renewed and Deadwood may not go on after the next season.  Maybe it's just as well.  Maybe the show has run its course like Oz.  I expect a Matrix-like decline from this point.  The second season has been a step backward for me, so if history repeats in the third season, I'll probably not care anymore.",1148515200,5,1755,4.466876971608833
2541460,5,B000EULSR0,"Why did HBO cancel ""Deadwood"" before David Milch could finish his beautiful story? It's the second-highest-rated of all HBO's ""Quality Programming"" hour-long dramas, and deservedly does very well in DVD sales. I personally have bought several DVD sets for myself, my family, and friends.

This show's fans (myself included) are rabidly passionate about it, and grateful for every word, every scene, every episode we've been blessed with so far. ""Deadwood"" is delicious and disturbing, the way great art always is, and we all hoped it would go on forever. So, of course, we were disappointed when HBO and Mr. Milch discussed ending the series after only four seasons. But it was creator Milch's choice, and his decision to make.

So what happened? Why isn't Mr. Milch going to be allowed to finish his masterpiece?  Can you find out for us?

Many of us fans are so angry and disgusted that we have decided to cancel our HBO subscriptions after the third season. This is what you do when you feel personally betrayed by a trusted resource. There is also talk about organizing a ""National Cancel HBO Day"" to be held at the end of Season Three ... and it's a movement that seems to be gaining support.

Recently, someone at the HBO Community Board established a website as a clearinghouse for ideas. It's at [...] and it's for folks who want to help in a massive grass-roots effort to bring HBO back to its senses, to its long-held mission, and to its loyal fan base.

It's time to make a few demands of HBO.",1147824000,23,1504,4.678030303030303
2541461,5,B000EULSR0,"This series just continues to get better.  It is by far the best current series on HBO.  The 2d season starts off with a serious illness to one of the main characters while others are given room to develop and evolve.  New players arrive on the scene while other characters from season 1 reappear in a highly changed form.  The 3 most important story lines of season 2 are the relationships between Bullock, his newly arrived wife, and Alma Garret, the arrival of Mr. W., chief geologist from the Hearst evil empire, and perhaps most importantly, the continuing evolution of the camp's relationship with Yankton, the capital of the Dakota Territory, as manipulated by Al Swearengen.  There are moments of great darkness along with hilarity usually involving Calamity Jane.  Since the 3rd season is beginning June 11, if you haven't seen season 2, I would respectfully suggest that you get  season 2 ASAP on May 23 and watch it before June 11.",1147737600,3,942,4.777777777777778
2541462,5,B000EULSR0,"First a review on the 2nd season of Deadwood, then my comments on the bizarre treatment of this show by HBO and possibly it's creator David Milch.

While the 1st season of Deadwood was almost unwatchable to some due to the constant profanity, it was hands-down in my opinion the best show on T.V. in gritty realism, set-design, writing, acting and re-watchability. You could watch the same episode for the 4th time and still catch something new. The dialogue was brilliant.

The 2nd season was just as compelling as the first (although a tad weaker) and it brought character development to a new height, introduced some brilliant new characters, and never lost its stride. Again highly re-watchable which makes it a nice DVD to own.

Now on to the strange behavior of HBO and David Milch. I just read that HBO released the contracts on the cast members of Deadwood allowing them to pursue other projects and hints at the fact that Deadwood may be dead no 4th season. Also, in the same news story it hinted at a new HBO series by David Milch about surfing culture.  In addition, was I the only one who seemed to notice that HBO was ignoring Deadwood earlier this year in the news, on its website, and even within its marketing deparment.  I mean The first trailer for season 3 appeared only last week! On top of all that, everyone knows that Summer is the Television graveyard and even though Big Love needed a strong kickoff behind Saprano's, exiling Deadwood to June makes me question HBO's sanity.  To sum it all up, when after Saprano's sleeps with the fishes next year, Deadwood will be its highest rated show and HBO and Milch may cancel it.

Has HBO lost its mind? Has Milch lost interest in 1870's South Dakota? IS this all a marketing ploy? Am I being paranoid?

I was the first in line to send feedback to HBO stating SAVE DEADWOOD! Lets hope I'm not the only one.",1147564800,43,1873,4.553571428571429
2541463,5,B000EULSR0,"As the second season of David Milch's Deadwood opens, we are given a glance at all the major characters.  Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) is now the sheriff of the lawless town, and Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) continues to have his firm grip on the town.  Leading up to an inevitable knock down, drag out showdown between the two, the stage is set for this excellent second season of one of the best shows HBO has ever conjured up.  There's a number of sub-plots throughout the season, including Bullock's affair with Alma (Molly Parker) getting further complicated when his estranged wife comes to town, as well as Swearengen's failing health, and Cy's (Powers Boothe) ulterior motives that always feature an ace up his sleeve.  There's a newcomer to the town as well, who has some ulterior motives of his own, and enjoys murdering prostitutes.  The Doc (Brad Dourif), E.B. (Will Sanderson), and Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) are all here in fine form as well.  The performances from everyone involved are once again great, and McShane is his usual excellent, award winning self as one of the most engaging television villains of all time.  As expected by anyone who viewed and enjoyed the first season, the second season of Deadwood is every bit as violent and gritty as one could expect.  Those who have been giving the series one star reviews are constantly bringing up the fact of the constant swearing throughout every episode.  It's true, it can get overdone and redundant, but this is the old West after all, and when every day is a battle for survival, you're bound to swear a lot for one reason or another.  That rant aside, Deadwood is still an excellent show, and by the time the credits roll at the conclusion of the season finale, you'll be begging for more.",1147132800,8,1772,4.761437908496732

8114481,4,B000EULSR0,"The discs come in a folding cardboard and plastic contraption, the type of contraptions HBO has used for many years and is still using on series like Game of Thrones. I don't like folding contraptions, but the discs play fine.

If you have a low tolerance for swear words avoid Deadwood.

I really liked the look and feel of the first season when the main protagonists moved to Deadwood to make their fortune in the hardware business. But the series didn't make it onto my great series list because the third season has a terrible ending. The bad guy wins and the good guys lose. The bad character gets away with killing an innocent little girl, and many others. The good guy protagonist turns out to be impotent and the camp is left as lawless at the end of the series as it was in the beginning. There is no worthwhile character or story arc, no good conclusion.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. If you like sci-fi you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2586,5.044496487119438
