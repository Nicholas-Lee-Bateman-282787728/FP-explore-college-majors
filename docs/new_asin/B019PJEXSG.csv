7578815,4,B019PJEXSG,"This budget release spreads 5 Van Damme films across 2 blu-rays. ""Maximum Risk"", ""Double Team"" & ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" share disc one and ""The Hard Corps"" & ""Second in Command"" share disc two. (Not sure why they didn't just go ahead and make this a six film set actually.) Each film is presented in its original aspect ratio but audio is presented for each film in lossy 2 channel stereo. ""Maximum Risk"" had been released on bluray previously with a 5.1 lossless audio mix however I am not sure if this 5 film collection shares the same transfer or not. ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" & ""Second in Command"" had previously been released on a bluray budget double feature with lossy audio as well. ""Double Team"" had been released on bluray in Germany with lossless audio and ""The Hard Corps"" had to the best of my knowledge only been available on DVD. While these films are far from Van Damme's best, for such a low priced budget release this comes highly recommended for his hardcore fans as they still offer lots of fun overall.

The picture quality overall is pretty decent. It appears these are just older HD transfers but still represent a nice step up from their DVD counterparts. The bit rates get up in the low 20's during busy sections and no compression artifacts could be seen which was a surprise especially with over four and a half hours of content being crammed onto disc one. Frustratingly like other budget bluray releases from Mill Creek Entertainment, each film is broke up into only 5 chapters and no English subtitles are offered.

My 4 star rating is purely for the hardcore Van Damme fans. This set represents tremendous value as I got mine for less than 10 dollars new including shipping. While the films vary wildly in actual quality with ""Maximum Risk"" being the best, taken as a whole you can't go wrong buying this for some good fun action with nice variety. And considering the stand alone blu-ray of ""Maximum Risk"" will by itself run you about the same price as this 5 film collection, you can't go wrong picking it up.",1484179200,4,2058,4.6510989010989015

7578823,5,B019PJEXSG,"What can I say. The quality is only so so. These are not remastered blu ray transfers. I really only bought it based on price and because Maximum Risk is more expensive in its own.
Maximum Risk is one of Van Damme's twin movies. But this one is pretty good.
The blu Ray disc lacks a modern menu and resume function. But for the price, I'll take it.",1468713600,3,348,4.132352941176471

7578828,4,B019PJEXSG,"Van Damme 5 movie collection recorded on two Blu Ray Discs  starting with Maximum Risk - Double Team - Universal Soldier : The Return on the first disc with a good picture recorded on Dolby Stereo and no special features o subtitles  ,  as for the second disc are The Hard Corps not a bad picture  recorded on Dolby Stereo  and Second in Command not the best picture for a Blu Ray even using my new 4K Amp Receiver and Darby edition Blu Ray player didn't help much probably the way the fim was shot .
 R rated with action and good fighting sequences , I have seen all the movies when first realeased even have a copy of Maximum Risk on Blu Ray recorded on true HD 5.1 and the difference isn't much with the picture just sound , A region locked : four for good value .",1465344000,,767,4.114093959731544

7578837,3,B019PJEXSG,"There are 5 movies in 2 BD. Not a lot of remastering here.  Picture quality is OK but is not much better DVD; audio stereo only (decent), no subtitles no extras
The movie selection is 50/50; Maximum Risk is the best of the pack; and the over the top Doble Team with Dennis Rodman and  Mickey Rourke is pure fun and deserves to be watched just for the spectacular cast.

Universal Soldier: The Return is not better than the first but has enough action to be acceptable

The Hard Corps  Van Damme attempt to drama; it lacks enough action to sustain the story. Viveca Fox is the best thing here; her face is a joy to watch

Second in Command another attempt on drama. It has a better pace than hard corps; but still far from Van Damme finest",1461024000,7,738,4.273381294964029
