8215386,5,B000UX6TJS,"The first three seasons were the best.  The very best!  The episodes were never quite the same after Barbara Bain and Martin Landau left the show.  It lacked something.  I think it was the chemistry those two superb actors brought to each episode.

I know the series continued after they left, but what a pity that Barbara Bain and Martin Landau couldn't come to financial terms with the producers, as these two actors were the reason why Series 1 - 3 is worth purchasing.",1400284800,,472,4.571428571428571
8215387,5,B000UX6TJS,"I was very pleased to find this on DVD and bought it about 2 years ago. With a couple busy kids I did not get a chance to watch it until a recent kidney stone kept me home. Believe me, any show that can hold your attention during a kidney stone attack had better be good, and this is one of the best!

The plots are well thought out and characters well constructed. Sure, you need to suspend some disbelief sometimes in terms of the laws of physics but that is part of the fun. The actors are all top notch and direction tight. This is SO much better than the movies that followed much later. The first 3 seasons were the best with the original cast (with transition from Hill to Graves) prior to the show IMHO degenerating into repetitious drug-related stories which even as I recall became somewhat gratuitous in terms of violence. The first 3 seasons are pure, classic IM.

The presentation is well done and the quality of the transfers quite good for such an old show. I highly recommend this set.",1261958400,,1001,4.376344086021505
8215388,5,B000UX6TJS,"I have always been completely satisfied with anything I've ordered from
Amazon.  I ordered these DVDs for a Christmas present.  I did open one and played the first program as I wasn't sure what the quality would be.  It was all I could ask for even though the TV show was taped in the 60's.",1226793600,,290,4.236363636363636

8215393,5,B000UX6TJS,"I loved this show so much on Sundays at 5p.m. (in NY!!) when I was a kid.  I will just have to wait until it goes on sale like I waited for ""ROME"" to be a deal of the day.  My favorite parts were when they'd tear off the face of the person they were impersonating.  Classic! Remember that?",1198195200,2,289,3.864406779661017
8215394,5,B000UX6TJS,"I remember it from my youth.. it's my most nostalgic searies ever made! starting with the leader dan, Steven Hill(low & order), who recieves each episode a self distracted order on a deferent ways in the first best season. Picks his team includes Martin Landau & Barbara Bain(space 1999) also greg moris & peter lupus which continue to cast in season 2 & 3 but jin, peter graves(forbiten plannet) who takes the leader place. even the first season it's the classic, the second and the third have unforgetible moments like: car drives by remote control, shootings, unic technics and so on, which the only Imposible Mission Force can do..",1189641600,6,635,4.834862385321101
