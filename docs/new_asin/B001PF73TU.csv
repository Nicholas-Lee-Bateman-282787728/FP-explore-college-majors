8333180,3,B001PF73TU,"I  was hard pressed to give it 3 stars. Enjoy the visual aspects, because the narration leaves MUCH to be desired. The mispronounced words like ""Edo"", ""sake"", ""kanji"" and ""origami"" were like nails on a chalk board. It just wasn't appealing.",1515196800,,240,4.853658536585366
8333181,1,B001PF73TU,"Why?  Vacuous, unsightly woman with warped perspective hawking prearranged shop visits as spontaneous information just begs the question of ""why?"". Zero redeeming value.",1449014400,,169,6.3478260869565215
8333182,1,B001PF73TU,This video is extremely outdated and the host is the worst. There's about 2 minutes of useful content here that can easily be found on the internet.,1404518400,,148,4.518518518518518
8333183,3,B001PF73TU,"Tokyo is my second favorite city in the world after London. However, there are a dearth of DVDs pertaining to Tokyo. Rick Steves, my favorite travel show host, refuses to do a show in the Far East. Rudy Maxa did an episode in Tokyo, but it was only a 1/2 hour. Samantha Brown also did an episode in Tokyo- but she spent most of the episode drinking sake. Globe Trekkers have an hour long Tokyo DVD, but it looks like it was made in 1990. With that in mind, I rented this on YouTube.

Cheryll has a shrill, annoying voice. She also acts like a bit of a diva. She is essentially a high class Samantha Brown. However, this episode featured nice views of Tokyo's skyscrapers and parks.

Cheryll visited the famous Ginza shopping district and the Hamarikyu Garden. She briefly stopped by this place that looked like an arcade (not a Pachinko Parlor). The episode also feature several department stores that put Harrods and Macy's Herald Square to shame. I should point out that the episode focused primarily on shopping and not traveling, though she did plenty of sightseeing.

I wanted to give this episode a higher rating, but Cheryll's overly perky demeanor quickly got on my nerve. Cheryll visited this electronics store. It was a cool store, but Cheryll acted like a complete moron. She was trying to be funny, but the employees and other shoppers weren't laughing with her. They were laughing AT her. They were looking at her like she was a dumb westerner.

If you sift through her antics, then you'll realize that she occasionally gives useful advice like telling people to ask the hotel for directions in Japanese if you take a taxi since taxi drivers don't speak English and recommending that people take the subway. She also interviewed some Geishas and explained that contrary to popular belief, Geishas are NOT prostitutes, but performers. She later visited the Tsukiji (sp?) Fish Market. Later, she ""rented"" a dog for the day. In Japan where it is densely populated and many people live in high rises where pets are prohibited, people ""rent"" pets for an hour or two.

She visited lots of interesting places and I enjoyed seeing Tokyo. I would've enjoyed this episode A LOT more if she wasn't so freaking annoying.",1399593600,,2221,4.728682170542636
8333184,1,B001PF73TU,"Her plastic face, plastic delivery, and most of all plastic soul makes me almost hate Japan, a place I love. Run from this video.",1394841600,,129,4.416666666666667
8333185,2,B001PF73TU,"This poor soul obviously has little idea what's going on although she carries herself fairly well. The largest source of confusion is this is a fashion segment and she's wearing horribly misguided outfits and looks awful the entire time. She's a distracting host. I only allowed it 2 stars because there was an overarching cultural theme that grants some side information. Unless you're interested in a woman who resembles a Texas mall debutante who reached her peak in the 80's and hasn't changed, skip this.",1393891200,2,509,5.0
8333186,3,B001PF73TU,I was leaving for Tokyo and looking for what I should see while I was there... There is a lot more info than just shopping...,1375056000,2,125,4.04
8333187,1,B001PF73TU,"how is she going to say that everything will look better on her?
Also, she talks funny as if she has something in her mouth while she's talking.
wrong person to send to Japan... she obviously does not appreciate Japan",1372982400,5,217,4.45
8333188,3,B001PF73TU,"Starts out fine, but a few minutes in you realize how self-absorbed the host is with her narcissistic demeanor and side comments. She also butchers common Japanese words like ""origami"" and ""kanji"". That said it is still an alright junk-food-for-the-brain travel documentary.",1361664000,6,274,5.5476190476190474
8333189,1,B001PF73TU,"I go to Tokyo twice a year so I guess my knowledge is ok. DVD starts from hotel Conrad but never mentioned are the prices--well, in my book prices go first and hotel name second. Tokyo designed quite practical and most shopping of any kind based around big stations like Tokyo, Ueno, Shibya etc and I mostly stay at Ueno as it very convenient to airport and Akihabara. And, in reality, Tokyo for a visitor starts from internet where we do research and when we land at Narita I buy me a pass for a subway which cost 1000 yen for two days but some routes not included. Each big station has multitude of hotels for any taste and price and Ueno is my favored. Any big station also has free map of Tokyo with shopping areas, subways and trains. Shopping in Tokyo does not start from Ginza as DVD suggests it starts from what you looking for--unusual stuff--in Akihabara, regular shopping--in Shibya, for young people--Harajuki  etc.",1340755200,,927,4.550898203592815
