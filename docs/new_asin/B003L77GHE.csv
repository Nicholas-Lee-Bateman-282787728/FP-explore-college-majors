4137864,5,B003L77GHE,"I watched season one with high hopes of Season Two being off the charts, and it is so far!  Looking forward to more Damon and Elaina action!  If you loved Twilight well what are you waiting for this is much better!  Super stunning actors(Ian Somerhalder), brilliant story-line, and even a twist of yoda humor.  And I don't mean that in a negative way either.  I give thanks to Julie Plec & Kevin Williamson for the fantastic production.  Hat's off to everyone within the cast you all make it work very well. Too Mr. Ian Somerhalder that Pattinson guy has nothing on you babe, you are by far the hottest vampire on any movie or tv show to date.  Peace for all & gbu.",1283990400,20,665,4.357723577235772

As a review of the show itself, I grew up watching The Vampire Diaries and I still think it is the best show out there. Especially the first couple of seasons, you will be very addicted and so driven into their world, you will fall in love with characters and hate others, but the plots and twists are just insanely good.

4138661,5,B003L77GHE,"Generally when I watch a show, the first season is usually the best one out of the entire series, but season 2 of The Vampire Diaries would have to be my favorite season so far. Season 1 is pretty compelling as well, but season 2 just brought so much to the table and just made this show get better by the minute.
  The second continuation of the thrilling and compelling series The Vampire Diaries, based off of the books by L.J. Smith and produced by Julie Plec left us with a theatrical season finale.  Stefan and Damons ex-girlfriend, Katherine, is back and didn't just come back from the love/hate relationship she has with the boys. The finale left the audience thinking about what was going to happen to Stefan and Elena's relationship with the jealous  Katherine Pierce back in town, and with the effect of Jonathan Gilbert's Vampire device. As  well as if Jeremy's decision to become a vampire, and Carolines health, when Tyler loses control of the car and gets himself, Matt and Caroline  in a car accident.

I am not one of those people that will just spill the entire beans on a review, but I will give some inside scoop for the people who are tempted to continue watching the series after season 1. The drama that happened in season 1 definitely brought people on the edge of their seats, but after watching season 2 multiple times, I have to say it raises the bar pretty high.

 Season 2 brings new and amazing characters to the show that will either stay with the series or could leave eventually.  The story line goes around the return of the devious Katherine.  The characters are having to adapt to her return and are on a mission to find out why she has come back. This ends up to be a definite plot twist! Through the season,  a new storyline starts to form.  A new type of creature returns to Mystic Falls along with a magical curse which could cause a lot of chaos.

This season definitely changes the characters forever and may lose some TVD regulars that have been on the show since day 1!!  Something that was remarkable about this season was the acting from Nina Dobrev.  She plays Elena, who is a regular character as well as Katherine who is a new character.  Nina definitely worked her butt off playing two characters back to back every day.  After watching this season, I am a huge fan of Stefan and Elena and their relationship.  Watching this season definitely gave me the up and down roller coaster ride experience due to watching their relationship go through a lot of bumps in the road. One hint from this season is that Stefan and Elenas relationship will never be the same after season 2.

Even though, Season 2 is my favorite I definitely recommend the whole series.  Even though some seasons might not be as exciting as season 1 or 2,  you have to keep watching. If you don't end up liking the seasons after 1 and 2, go back and watch the seasons you did enjoy!",1427760000,,2900,4.483809523809524

4138814,4,B003L77GHE,"Just like the first season in terms of quality. It seems to be a little less durable, but the first season I bought in at a local electronic store (Best Buy) for the same price as Amazon. They didn't offer the second season, which is why I bought it on Amazon. It does come with a sheath, and then the Blu-Ray case is inside of it (similar to Season 1).

About the TV series: I am an intelligent young woman who does not enjoy many TV shows because of the mindless sex, overdone stories, and too much drama. Sometimes, it leads me to believe in a life that does not exist. I am about 1/3 of the way through the second season, and I personally am not enjoying it (I will give no spoilers). The first few episodes in Season 1 was like the audience it was intended for, but then you got to know Stephan, and see the struggle he faces. You see an orthodox vampire and a vampire who is trying to be different, to do good in the world. He is the ultimate anti-hero. That's what I liked about Season 1: the little bits of wisdom stacked with a vampire (yuck), who is trying to reclaim his humanity. What does it mean to be human? Why do we cling to it? Our emotions are our greatest weapon, but if given the chance, would we give them up for an immortal life?

I rate the Blu-Ray Product a 4/5, and the second season movie a 3/5.",1424476800,,1322,4.12015503875969

4139380,5,B003L77GHE,"Season 2 was incredible...Katherine Pierce (a.k.a) Katerina Petrova finally gets what's coming to her. Damon's 360-degree turn during this season was breathtaking. He was sometimes evil sometimes passionate. I have developed a huge crush on the older Salvatore but I am & will forever will be a Stelena worshiper. But these episodes, in my opinion, was ALL Damon.
1) The Return (Katherine breaks Damon...poor thing.)
2) Rose (Damon's heart-felt confession. He's starting to feel...)
3) The Descent (Who did not cry when he had to kill Rose...someone who truly could have loved him 100% had to die at his hands.)
4) The Dinner Party (I agree with you Damon. There's absolutely no need to leave John on the endangered species list...)
5) The House Guest (Damon REJECTS Katherine...I was laughing my ass off.)
6) The Last Dance (Stefan & Elena were completely fooled....about Bonnie's fate. Damon's a genius.)
7) The Last Day (Damon DON'T go to rescue a werewolf on a full moon WITHOUT wolfsbane.)
8) The Sun Also Rises (Damon you're not fooling anyone...you LOVE your brother say it already.)
9) As I Lay Dying (Damon poor thing...suffering from the same fate as his lover Rose. I truly believe he was thinking about her when he tried to commit suicide.)

Stefan Salvatore he made the biggest sacrifice at the end of the season. But I truly believe that Season 1 was about him to doing whatever it took to protect Elena & her loved ones. Damon was the hero during this season. But he did have his moments:
#1: He martyred himself into the tomb to save Jeremy's life.
#2: He apologized to Damon for forcing him to turn.
#3: He willingly offers himself to take Jenna's place in the sacrifice.
#4: Klaus...all he had to do was cut open his wrist and give Stefan his blood. He DID NOT have to blackmail Stefan into becoming a killer again to save Damon. That's just him being to manipulative sadistic bastard he is.

Overall, Season 2, is hands-down my favorite season!",1409097600,,1963,4.75366568914956

Everyone is getting used to the secrets and some accidentally fall into ""the know."" Enter the Originals. Now it is getting real interesting. Stefan and Damon fight to keep Elena alive and out of their reach.

First I was super excited to see the Originals. I actually watched that show first. I knew it was a spin off and now I can see where they were pulled from. Klaus and Elijah are great vampires.

I adore Damon. He is back with his little snarky quips and terrible foot-in-mouth disease, while Caroline and Matt are still trying to figure it out. Tyler is sifting through some family history that could be life changing. Bonnie is getting more powerful every day but she struggles to keep her friendships with vampires and their allies.

My favorite characters. These all have shows, in my humble opinion, good development. They are all learning and growing. Each adapting to their circumstances in a great way. I look forward to what will happen next.",1400284800,,1076,4.805405405405406

I've been into the whole vampire thing since Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I must say that this is another great vampire show. This show draws you in and keeps you hooked. The second to last episode was a powerful one that still has me reeling. The cast is great, and the characters are well written.

4140162,4,B003L77GHE,I think season 2 is the best season of TVD.  Doppleganger hijinks and supernatural goings on - Damon is not quite so annoying and has his only character growth of the series to date in season 2.

4140419,5,B003L77GHE,"This season is definitely the best IMHO, as my twin said, ""It has a great story arc."" What an amazing story arc! *Spoiler Alert* We finally get to meet Katherine, who keeps impersonating Elena (which annoys her to no end). Elena becomes more like Katherine as her pattern of using Damon (throughout the series really) continues, yet she hates Damon for understandable reasons. To me the two women are the heart of the series. Much of what we learn about the two is important in understanding them and the Salvatore brothers, and actress Nina Dobrev is excellent in her portrayal of Elena and Katherine.
As everyones hands get dirty, I find myself drawn to Damon, Caroline and Alaric. They seem to have a real consistency with their personalities. They've errored, they apologize (sometimes) and then they seem to move on without dwelling in misery. Damon is our Loki, Caroline a fallen princess, and Alaric the doomed lover.
There are no good guys or bad guys, everyone on the show has an agenda and they're sticking to it. I absolutely adore this series, it is boyond addictive and love all the characters. With each episode it only gets better.",1366675200,,1146,4.792929292929293

4140421,5,B003L77GHE,I bought this because I got my gf into the show and we watch it together she is almost at the end of this season,1366588800,,112,3.52
4140422,5,B003L77GHE,"Okay, I admit it: I'm a fan. I read the books way back when (and for the record, they were awful- but *very* engaging and still WAY better then 'Twilight'), and I was excited about the show. I didn't care that Elena went from blond to brunette and had a brother instead of a sister, and the Salvatores were from Virginia instead of Italy, I was just psyched to see the triangle up on screen. Season 1 got off to a shaky start, but did not disappoint.

Season 2, on the other hand, is not only ""not disappointing"", but has some really great episodes. One of the running themes is the evolution of Caroline's character and her friendship with Stefan, which mirrors his relationship with Lexi.

In the opener, Caroline, is turned into a vampire and gains a small measure of revenge on Damon for his mistreatment of her when he first comes into town (#1 ""The Return""). It's amazing to watch Caroline grow a spine along with her fangs and I found myself rooting for her alongside the two brothers and Elena. Another one of my faves is #6 ""Plan B"", in which Jeremy struggles to become part of Mystic Falls' new world order and Damon and Katherine reveal just how ruthless they are. There's also the introduction of Rose (#8 ""Rose"") who gets Damon to show his softer side. Katherine's back story is featured (#9 ""Katerina"") which gave Nina Dobrev a chance to really shine- I think she got her People's Choice award for her work in Season 2, actually. There's also the first of many wonderful episodes showing how Lexi influenced the brothers and the relationship between Elena and Original Elijah (#15 ""The Dinner Party""). The finale (#22 ""As I Lay Dying"") which is a neat little full-circle move showing that what happened to Jeremy in the first episode (and the Season 1 finale) had consequences,

If you're a fan of the show, and like rewatching for nuance and characterization, this is worth owning.",1366156800,,1896,4.620178041543027
4140423,5,B003L77GHE,"Or, as we know them on tv, Stefan, Damon, and Elena/Katherine.  I love the show, watch it every week.  I especially enjoyed Season 2 because we got to meet, and see quite a bit of Elijah and his family.  That brought a whole new set of issues to the Mystic Falls group, making life more exciting in this small town every day.  If you like the tv show, you will love the DVD.  Go  back and relive your favorite episodes and favorite scenes.",1365292800,,439,4.228915662650603
4140424,5,B003L77GHE,"I chose a 5 because it is a great bridge between the Twilight movies and True Blood, both of which I enjoy immensely. If you are into Vampires that are mainstream then this is a good watch.  You have the tortured sexy vampires wrestling with their good and bad natures and in a love triangle with a human. Season two further develops the relationships between the  two vampire brothers and their mutual love interest.  I found this very enjoyable and watched it twice.  I can't wait for season four to be released.",1365206400,,514,4.554347826086956

4140756,5,B003L77GHE,"I hadn't seen a single episode of this show until last week, and had no idea what it was that might separate this show from any of the others in the genre.

After noting the extremely high percentage of 5-star ratings, out of nearly 400 reviews for Season 1, and the remarkably high percentage out of the nearly 300 reviews for Season 2, and reading the specifics conveyed by others in their reviews, I had to see for myself what so many had found so compelling about this show.

I initially thought this show was simply a combination of 'vampire' + 'high school', but that's SO NOT IT.  Of the various reviews I read, what became pivotal for me were those which were from people who did not consider themselves fans of the genre, and those which commented regarding the show having exceptional writing -- and I happen to now be among the chorus of those singing the praises of this show, and belong to both of those 'camps'.

Although I saw the Twilight movies, I wasn't all that impressed by them -- the stories or the acting.  When I checked out True Blood (again, to see what all the fuss was about :) ), I enjoyed Season 1, wasn't such a fan of Season 2, and really liked Season 3.  However, this show strikes me as being relatively peerless -- it's simply that good, and I don't know what even comes close.  I continue to marvel at the exceptional storylines, which are not only paired with phenomenal writing, involving truly remarkable creativity, and skilled pacing, but fantastic acting.

I'm blown away by this show, and am utterly delighted to have found a show whose incredible storylines downright fascinate me, and keep me spellbound, from episode, to episode.  In working my way through the Season 1 set, I initially didn't understand what the fuss was all about -- however, after certain initial specifics were fleshed out (no pun intended), it became apparent that this was no ordinary show, and I soon found myself in that delightful state of anticipation, after each episode concluded -- I had to watch the next one, right away... :)

And that 'snowballing' of anticipation and practically being mesmerized by the show was even more true of Season 2 -- holy crap, WHAT A SEASON!  It's like they laid the groundwork in Season 1 for a stunning 'lift off', in Season 2 -- the creativity and stunningly wonderful writing are 'off the charts' in this season.

I can't recommend this show highly enough.  I happen to be a sci-fi fan, and enjoy when it crosses into what is deemed to be within the fantasy realm, and find ventures into the supernatural to be fertile ground for great stories, but am not 'hardcore' regarding any genre -- my preference, above all, is for great stories -- and this show delivers it in abundance.

For anyone who might be 'on the fence', and among those who, like me (until last week, that is) hadn't seen an episode of this show, I hope you decide to give it a try, as there is so much to enjoy about this wonderful series.

Great stories, great writing, and great execution (again, no pun intended [lol]) -- it's got it all!",1358294400,,3070,4.56648451730419
4140757,2,B003L77GHE,"I ordered the first three seasons on DVD because I am a huge TVD fan, and received my order on time. However, I was very upset to find that the case for the season 2 box set had a large slash in the plastic protection screen on the actual case, that began on the front of the case in the top right corner and ended on the back of the case in the middle. The discs and box are fine and in new condition, but the tear on the case is upsetting. I take great care of all of my TV box sets and have never had a problem with product quality before.

4140866,5,B003L77GHE,"Very entertaining show. As a dude...I don't care for all of the lovey dovey stuff. But the vampire scenes are fantastic and the plot is extremely well done.

This show is a more mild version of True Blood. Not nearly as much sex/violence/cursing as its HBO cousin. I am a little old school, so I like that there aren't boobs in every scene. This show is just as good (if not better) than True Blood simply because the show doesn't have to flaunt sex in every scene just to keep people interested. Plus the Vampire Diaries doesn't have fairies. Which is always a plus in my mind.

Highly recommend.",1357776000,,597,4.467889908256881

4140868,4,B003L77GHE,"""Vampire Diaries"" is a show that makes use of all the standard urban fantasy/ paranormal romance cliches without taking itself too seriously, and that makes it a guilty pleasure that you don't have to be ashamed of.
The story is the same old thing, beautiful high school coed falls for mysterious stranger/high school boy who turns out to be a vampire (who thankfully does not sparkle, or sneak into her room to watch her sleep, or anything creepy like that).
She is the spitting image of his long lost love and so he ""must know her!""
He is the good guy she is looking for to help provide stability in her life after the death of her parents in a car crash.
You get the idea.
The main character, Elena (Nina Dobrev), is beautiful and all of her friends are gorgeous (sort of like they are all Hollywood actresses or something)and they hang out with pretty boys and get into supernatural trouble.
One of the problems that I have with the program, however, is that although the show is set in a small town in Virginia, and at least two of the characters grew up there before the Civil War, virtually no one in the show sounds like they have ever been in the south. It also bugs me that the characters frequently act out of plot driven stupidity (""I can't believe that this character, who has screwed us over 47 times in the last five weeks, would do something bad to us THIS time."").
On the up side, the writers frequently make fun of the standard vampire goes back to high school tropes and the characters get to make snarky comments about the fact that this tiny little town seems to have some kind of festival, or major event every other week.
Also, hasn't anybody notice the unusually high death rate in this tiny town?
On the other hand, I like the fact that the leaders of the town are not entirely dim and have some idea of what is going on.
The show is worth watching, if you don't try and take it seriously.",1357689600,,1914,4.379213483146067

4141422,3,B003L77GHE,"I'm not a huge fan of this show, but I watch it enough through my roommate (about one out of every few episodes when I happened to be making or eating dinner while she marathoned through it ) to have an opinion.  This is basically just a successful attempt to cash in on the vampire craze... it's Twilight: The TV Show.  It's pretty well-done for what it is -- which is to say there's high production value for a cable tv show, everyone's very attractive, and most of the actors do a decent job in delivering their lines.  The plot gets pretty convoluted, though (I get the sense they weren't expecting it to run as long as it has when they made it) and most of the romances don't hold water if you stop to think about them.  This is the kind of show that I have to make a conscious effort not to poke fun at when it's on, lest I incur the wrath of the ladies enthralled by it.

If you're into supernatural romance, you'll probably love this show.  If you're not, the plot probably won't be enough to keep you interested, but the experience is bearable.  I personally wouldn't pay $1.99 an episode for this, especially since I'm pretty sure most of it is available on various streaming services or On Demand, but I can understand why a fan would.",1339372800,,1246,4.3218884120171674

4141570,5,B003L77GHE,"Though book fans may not care for the direction in which this show is headed, most of us tuned in for each new episode knowing we were in for quite an experience. Becoming stronger and more mature in its second season, The Vampire Diaries is not for the faint of heart... and we wouldn't want it to be.

Katherine has returned. The charming, beautiful vampire who first turned Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) in the aftermath of the Civil War has arrived in Mystic Falls, much to the horror of her doppelganger and Stefan's current girlfriend, Elena (Nina Dobrev). And she's out to have some, well, fun. The intensely jealous vampire has no interest in allowing the lovers peace and threatens to harm Elena's brother Jeremy (??) and her aunt Jenny (??) if they don't break up. But her actions toward the unhappy duo are just a smokescreen - she has something much more exciting planned that involves an ancient curse and a precious moonstone. Unfortunately for all of them, Caroline (Candice Accola) is caught up in the mix. Near death after a car accident, she is visited by Katherine and given a dose of vampire blood and a broken neck. She awakens with a hunger for blood and uncertainty as to where this new twist of fate will lead her. Bonnie (Katerina Graham) is struggling with her powers as a witch, and holds a growing hatred for vampires that may unleash a tide of violence.

But Caroline is not the only one questioning her existence... as it seems the werewolf gene in the Lockwood family has been activated. Mason intends on ending Damon (if Damon doesn't end him first) but his nephew Tyler is about to experience the real traumas of the family curse. And that doesn't even cover the new vampires in town, the arrival of the warlocks, or the re-emergence of an ancient evil even Katherine is terrified of...

Creating quite a stir due to its daring and sometimes scandalous ad campaigns, those unfamiliar with the material would be surprised to learn that this series is tamer than the previews might suggest. It has a solid cast that is ever expanding, continuity in its ongoing arcs, and never fails to stretch out in new and exciting directions. Fans of the love triangle in particular will like certain scenes and implications this season, as we find out how Damon truly feels about Elena. The first half is a lot of fun with the return of Katharine and the transformation of Caroline into a vampire, the next batch of episodes deals with the werewolf problems, and finally the season ends by returning to the beginning and the implications of both curses. In terms of storytelling it's solid and week to week breaks out surprises, which is one of the reasons it is so popular. It is a smart show and that is not often found in programming aimed at young adults.

It goes without saying that this series is edgy and controversial. It contains all the elements your grandmother would hate -- vampires, werewolves, and witches, which may be why it is so popular among young adults. It's that touch of forbidden attraction that we all harbor deep inside. If the description put you ill at ease, it's a safe bet you won't want to try it out.",1332892800,2,3182,4.656583629893238

Watch it from the beginning for sure, but definitely pick this up. It is one of few shows I have bought on DVD so I could watch it again, although I find it to be so darn memorable (unlike most shows on TV) that I can remember most of the episodes moment for moment, which is saying alot.
Buy this even if you don't necessarily love vampires. The characters, actors, storylines, and cliffhangers will have you sold! At it's heart, it is a story of a very intense love triangle and of the ups and downs of all kinds of relationships.

Season 2 is so much better than 1 because Caroline is a vampire and is much nicer. Damon is obviously more smitten by Elena, but he can't act on it because of Stefan. I especially like the addition of Katherine.  This is one of my favorite tv shows to watch. I like it better than the books honestly because Damon has some real possibilities with Elena on the show.",1325548800,,491,4.279569892473118

Sound is great, only have a problem with the picture. I have tried it with different TVs, different HDMI cables, and different bluray players. It's definitely from the discs. I wish it were better quality since I opted for the blurays over the DVDs. The first season blurays I bought were better quality.

4142039,5,B003L77GHE,"I'm too old to be watching this show and my friends roll their eyes when I mention it but I don't care - it's too good to care about such trifles. I read the books by L.J. Smith in high school and loved them then, so when I heard they were making them into a tv series I was doubtful yet ever so curious. After watching the first & second seasons and half way into the third I have to say Kevin Williamson (and the team) has done a fantastic job of adapting the books into this hip, fun, scary and sexy series. The banter is witty, the acting is surprisingly good (Nina Dobrev is fantastic as Elena/Katherine), the storylines are compelling and OMG - the eye candy is off the charts HOT! That being said the show is more than that. There is all the requisite teenage drama yes, but further into the series you get to see back stories of main characters who are centuries old so they have rich material there to work with. What surprises me most about the show is that even in its third season it's still fresh with fascinating new characters and more answers being revealed as new questions arise to keep you wanting more. The arrival of the Originals into the mix is particularly good, naughty-bad-fun good. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the vampire genre.",1325116800,,1277,4.347280334728033

4142329,4,B003L77GHE,"I was not planning on watching this series, much less becoming a Vampire Diaries Junkie, but it happened.  I watched the first episode of the first season and had to watch the second, and so on.  I watched the first season in two nights and ordered the second season.  It was made for young adults and it's fascinating to see what these kids get up to.  As an adult you wonder vaguely how these kids can get away with all the stuff they manage to do...parties every weekend, parents aware of their kids drinking and doing drugs and doing nothing to stop it.  Short on parental supervision and long on self gratification. Under all that there are the mysteries involved behind the scenes of all the parties. You see that the parents are aware of the Vampires,and the witches and the werewolves. They are so involved in killing and keep the ""evil"" that they let it slip in unaware that they don't know everything.  Vampires that are good, and Vampires that are evil, and Vampires you think are evil and turn out not to be evil.  Vampires that can go out in the sun, but only because of talismans made by witches that have magic attached to them.
It's a fun romp through the supernatural. You have your whiny tortured vampire (this appears to be a per-requisite for this type of story, i.e. the whiny Vampire gets the girl) that is trying so hard to be good. Your evil vampire that isn't really evil but who is tortured because he loves the girl his brother has. Then you have the Girl.  The one they both love. (Oh why must they choose the whiny tortured vampire.) The two vampires are brothers.  This series has a bit of everything for everybody...Vampires, Witches and Werewolves.  Doppelgangers appears to be the main theme for season two as the ""girl"" is playing two parts.  One of a Vampire (self involved, all about me vampire), and the other the teenage girl that the brother vampires are in love with.  All this sounds very Soap Opera-ish, but this series manages to stay just clear of that.
It's fun, suspenseful, intense and takes the supernatural just beyond it's boundaries.  It's enjoyable.",1323648000,,2101,4.600536193029491

4142331,5,B003L77GHE,"I am a huge fan of the show, but I especially loved Season's 2 ""Year of Kat"". Katherine is the best villain yet. She is devious, scheming, selfish, and has no compulsions about breaking some eggs to make omelette. Yet Katherine is such a delicious villain that you love to hate her and want to keep her around nevertheless. You sometimes forget that the same actress is playing Elena. I also grew much more attached to characters that I had simply assigned to as backround plotlines. The Caroline scenes sometimes steal the entire episode and we get new faces with the werewolves (like Mason! *swoon*). I absolutely recommend this show, especially this season. I bought this during the black friday week bonanza and got a price that that left me and my bank account gleeful. Amazon is the place to order especially during their specials. The only reservations I hold regarding this set is about the extras. There's not much of them. I would have loved an extended blooper reel. Season 1's blooper reel was significatly longer.

The whole story is aiming at the appearance of the mysterious ""Klaus"" and before his appearence you never know who or what this ""Klaus"" really is. So you are anxious to know during the whole season. There are also new interesting facts about the vampire world, the witches and the werewolve world and they are all credible in the movie. Thus, the storyline is very good and the characters became all more interesting. However, it was a little bit too bloody for my taste. I think it would have been equally thrilling with a little bit less killing and with less torturing scenes.
All actors are doing a very good job. They are all convincing and you always think that the character could really be like this if he or she would exist. Nina Dobrev has a very difficult job, because she has to play two characters; one is very lovely and selfless and the other character very selfish; and she is doing this very well.

When TVD started back in '09 I thought well....another vampire-romance frigging Bella Swan rip-off??? Yes...I'd think that...heck! Everyone would've thought that with all the vampire craze that's going on...

But from...I don't know, 5th season 1 episode I was officially hooked...TVD has proved to me that a show CAN exploit the vampire romance craze out there but provide many awesome tv moments too...

This season started out strong, picking up exactly from the season 1 finale ""Founder's Day""...with ""The Return""...
All that talk and foreshadowing of Katherine and finally she made her return felt with turning Caroline?!?!?!?! to a frigging vampire which was needless to say plain awesome...I loved Candice Accola's character and she proved an awesome character even as a vamp...
Watching Nina Dobrev playing two characters was plain fun and I have to give major kudos to the beautiful actress as this was not an easy task and has without any objections pulled this off! Elena and Katherine are two completely different characters and this was one of the best -if not THE best- things of the season...
Now adding the Original vampire family to the mix spiced things up with the second half of the season focusing on how to save Elena from the infamous Klaus all climaxing to the frigging excellent ""The Sun Also Rises""...
The show has awesome storylines and EVERY episode is a big episode as the back cover is, spot-on, stating...

Now I won't talk too much...just hear me out here and you won't be dissapointed, when I say THIS. IS. AN. EXCELLENT. SHOW.

Favorite episodes include: ""The Return"", ""Brave New World"", ""Bad Moon Rising"", ""Memory Lane"", ""Kill or Be Killed"", ""Plan B"", ""Masquerade"", ""Katerina"", ""Daddy Issues"", ""The House Guest"", ""The Last Dance"", ""The Sun Also Rises"" and the season finale with an awesome cliffhanger, ""As I Lay Dying""

Preety much the half season ending up in the favorites list isn't bad, huh?",1318723200,,1953,5.049689440993789

I absolutely loved how they put in so many flashbacks, it made the story easier to understand because it can get a little confusing at times. The only complaint I have is that I got it late and the case was broken on the inside.

It will appeal to fans of the ""Moonlight"" series and the Twilight Saga"" books and movies, but I feel that ""The Vampire Diaries"" is a lot more appealing, dramatic and action-packed.  Watching the entire 22-program season on DVD without commercials is a real treat for fans after having to wait a week in between TV broadcasts all season long.

But I wait for each episode to start heading off into a direction that is too indepth or unrealistic for me to enjoy anymore. Instead, each season, writers Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, never fail to keep the episodes real and in touch with - well - reality.

The actors who portray their characters - Ian Somerhalder as Damon Salvatore, Nina Dobrev as Elena Gilbert, Paul Wesley as Stefan Salvatore, and Joseph Morgan and Klaus - are absolutely great at what they do. They bring the show to life, and make you believe that this is really what's going on in Mystic Falls, Virgina. They are so indepth that you get to know, not only what is on the surface, but what is in their background, their entire past, they snap, they soften - every situation imaginable for a character's personal growth is portrayed excellently here.

This season, it picks up right where the last episode in season 1 left off, and we really learn more about all of the character's backgrounds and the motivations behind multiple characters. We see Damon's character advance and mature, as well as see his true nature (Sorry, I'm a bit biased, he's my favorite character). We learn a whole lot about this Katherine, AKA Katerina Petrova and what a doppleganger is. We learn about Stefan's not-so-innocent past. We see Caroline's character advance, mature, and grow into a stronger, self-sufficent person. And a whole lot more. Each episode is like a grand finale with little room for dull moments.

Even if you're not a fan of the vampire genre, this is a series that is very genre flexible (unless you very strictly hate fantasy, sci fi, and horror) because it is so realistic, there is something that you can relate to in every character, situation, etc.",1316736000,7,2012,5.24223602484472
4143101,5,B003L77GHE,i bought this dvd used and it is in great condition... and it was shipped to me very fast and in a timely manner and i have even watched some episodes already and i cant even tell it is used....very good quality and going to continue to watch and see if this seller has more things :p,1316304000,,284,4.0
4143102,5,B003L77GHE,"when ""The Vampire Diaries"" was first being promoted, I was torn. I still mourn the loss of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" because that was such a great, great show. But I've seen enough bad vampire movies and shows (I am NOT a Twilight lover at all) and read enough bad vampire novels that I've gotten sick of all the low quality stuff out there (and I would throw Anne Rice's last several vampire novels into the ""low quality"" category, although I still think her first novel ""Interview With The Vampire"" was brilliant).

Also, many of these shows start out and then get canceled. So I was afraid to watch it and start to like it, only to have it whisked away from me like Moonlight was (with Alex O'Loughlin, now on the remade ""Hawaii Five-O"" show). (Not that Moonlight was a great show; gag, the first ep was TERRIBLE -- totally cliche writing, utterly predictable story. But it did get better as it went along, largely due to the actors playing the roles.)

So I watched ""The Vampire Diaries"" first episode (pilot) and thought, ""Yawn, another broody vampire who hates being a vampire, and falling in love with a mortal. Seen it.""

But then I kept watching it and, damn it, the show reeled me in. I'm not even in the target demographic (I'll be 44 this fall), and I couldn't stop watching.

This is largely because of Ian Somerhalder's portrayal of Damon Salvatore, I admit. He's just fantastic in this role. (I never watched him on ""Lost"" though I may go back and watch it now that I know he's in it.)

He plays Damon initially (early in Season 1) as the brother who is the ""bad boy"" -- but later proves himself to be the brother who is most capable of doing what needs to be done, no matter how distasteful. More importantly, he's the one who SEES what needs to be done.

His wrestling with the human side of him, trying to push it away and keep it at arm's length, and his gradual, grudging willingness to let it surface -- along with the inherent conflict it presents to his largely vampire self -- is the most fascinating aspect to TVD, in my opinion. Ian Somerhalder started out playing Damon kind of over the top, in my opinion, but he has developed a bit more economy in how he uses his expressiveness (although I feel his frequent scowling and brow-scrunching is a bit overdone... nevertheless it's also pretty effin' hot, so I can tolerate it, though it gets campy at times).

Then, too, Nina Dobrev's portrayal of Katherine Pierce in the flashbacks makes her a young actress worth watching. I didn't initially find Elena very compelling, but she grew on me after the first episode. She also grew a spine, which helped. But most impressive has been Dobrev's ability to play both the good-hearted and somewhat naive Elena (you'd think, with all she's been through, she'd be more doomy/gloomy) and the calculating, manipulative Katherine. She really does a terrific job, including lampooning her own portrayal of Elena when Katherine impersonates Elena at the costume ball in the second season.

Because of my work schedule (hospital RN), I was going to miss the last few episodes of TVD, and I wanted to be guaranteed to get the episode ""As I Lay Dying."" I'd had good luck with Amazon Unbox video before, so I chose to get it that way.

The quality of the video is very good. It's not quite DVD quality, but almost (but it's definitely NOT Blu-Ray quality).

Although this episode starts tying up loose ends, the main cliffhanger from the previous episode that is resolved in this one is Damon Salvatore's fatal werewolf bite.

I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but I will say this: the Elena/Damon chemistry grows, and you get hints of what COULD BE... ""if only."" Poor Damon. Wanting Elena and loving her bring out his humanness, which is of course terribly hard for him.

A really good, necessary episode to watch. Actually I would say the last 5 episodes of Season 2 of TVD are necessary. But then, I ended up buying both Seasons on DVD... so I paid for ""As I Lay Dying"" twice, darn it! Couldn't help myself. It was pretty much worth it for the way it takes me away from my mundane life and problems.",1316217600,3,4125,4.544474393530997

4143152,5,B003L77GHE,"Season 1 of this show was amazing, so I was delighted that season 2 is even better.  Every character on the show becomes more multi-dimensional this season.  Caroline as a vampire is so amazing.  Her storyline with Tyler has its very own spin-off potentional.  Bonnie turns even more bad-ass as a witch Goddess. Fans of Willow from Buffy will love her power and growth as well as her new love interest this season.  The first half deals with Katherine and the fallout of her arrival.  Then the introduction of the werewolfs takes this show up a notch that Twilight's New Moon couldn't match. The introduction of the original vampires Klaus and Elijah was a work of genius.  I can't think of one thing that would have improved this season. Fans of both Stefan and Damon will find plenty of moments to cheer about this season. However, the best relationship in this show for me is the relationship between the two brothers, Stefan and Damon.  Seeing them come together and often clash to protect Elena is spell-bounding.  Stefan proves over and over he will always do what Elena wants him to do while Damon will always do what he believes is BEST for her or what she needs.  The contrast in the two approaches is amazing. The length Stefan goes to at the end of the season to save his brother is heartwrenching.  This show is for all ages and all fans of the supernatural genre.  My 63 year old father started watching season 1 with me and loved it.  I can't wait until he watches all of season 2.",1314576000,5,1495,4.5130111524163565

4143246,3,B003L77GHE,"Whilst I do enjoy the vampire diaries and make sure I watch every episode, sometimes I groan in frustration at the idiocy that this show throws out. I am quite convinced that the writers have a plot wheel on their desk and when looking for a plot point, they spin that wheel. That's the only reason I could think of for some of the stupidity that crops up during this show:

Highlights include:

1. Elijah not killing Klaus because Klaus mentioned about his family. Sorry but how long has Elijah been alive? As soon as he failed to stake his brother, I could see the betrayal coming a mile off. That seems crap to me as why would Elijah believe his brother? Why wasn't he anticipating this staking? Surely he should have said, 'fine they're alive and I'll find them myself' before staking Klaus. My friends and I howled in annoyance at this.

2. Tyler not helping Caroline when she was kidnapped by Jules. I mean, he barely knows Jules and co, but he has known Caroline for years and she stood by him during his first werewolf transformation, yet he lets her be tortured and barely raises an eyebrow. I mean if given a choice between an old friend and some new people that you don't know, you would logically side with your old friend. Made absolutely no sense.

3. Why does Klaus want Stefan to go all blood addicted? I mean if Klaus has got a secret crush on Stefan, fine, but really it makes no sense. Klaus can certainly do enough damage by himself, why does he need Stefan?

4. Turning Jenna into a vamp, I mean it was shocking and all, but really was it necessary? It seemed overly complicated and used purely to angst Elena and Jeremy some more.

5. The sudden 'sacrifice for another spell' that supposedly redeems John. Sorry but that was an ass pull.

6. And Elena's desire to save Bonnie, especially when they find out just what else the ritual needs. Erm excuse me, you don't want to sacrifice your friend, but you're quite willing to kill yourself and two others. Bravo for you Elena. We would have preferred Elena sacrificing herself after exhausting every other possibility, not ignoring everything else in order to sacrifice herself. (shades of Bella Swan anyone?)

These are the few I can think of atm, but when I watch this show with friends, we do enjoy it but every episode, something utterly random and ill thought out happens. Hence the 3 stars. Love the actors and quite enjoy that it is different to the book. Luckily the enjoyment I get from the show outweighs the idiocy that frequently happens.",1312761600,9,2520,4.547461368653422

As a fan of the genre, I really liked this show, it seemed to get better and better with the new season (unlike True Blood, sigh...).

4143633,4,B003L77GHE,"I've watched every vampire TV series of note (and many that were forgettable) in the last 40 years, and VD is not the best, but it is also definitely not the worst. Coming after shows like BTVS and Angel, Vampire Diaries (and True Blood) have a lot to live up to in terms of great writing and strong characters (especially female characters), and they often fall short. (This is just my opinion; do keep in mind, I'm not a tween, teen, or twenties kid who hasn't seen anything else besides Twilight, True Blood or VD; I have much higher expectations than the average viewer, I guess.)

It's funny, I started out watching the premiere episode of season 1 and the first few season 1 VD eps relating to Elena as a kind of shell-shocked survivor of family tragedy... but then VD became so unrealistically melodramatic, I couldn't relate.  But since Season 2 began, although there were some episodes that kind of stumbled, most have been really interesting, and these last few have been really good. This one -- The Last Day -- is probably up there in the top five.

Maybe it's because I'm older now, I don't go for the vampire-trying-to-be-good/human types as much as I did when I was younger... I find the vampire characters who just accept their vampire nature and run with it more intriguing. I guess because I've already been through so much crap in life, I realize now that things are not black and white, that there are many paths to the same destination, and that many shades of gray and levels of moral ambiguity are involved in doing both good and evil. And I also realize that sometimes you just have to seize the moment while you can. Perhaps that's why I find Damon a much more interesting character than Stefan, and, frankly, he is a major reason I tuned in week after week this second season.

The show really became interesting to me when Damon's unrequited love for Elena began to surface, and when Katarina returned to wreak havoc in the brothers' lives. It was hard to get into the first season: Damon, revelling in being bad, was much more the reason I tuned in than Stefan &/or Elena.

But this season, Caroline's turning and then her strange love triangle(ish) situation and her relationship with Tyler kept me tuning in, as did Bonnie's development of her powers... again, these story arcs kept my attention this season much more than the Stefan/Elena story arc (heresy, I know!). And of course Katarina's meddling and messing with everyone/everything, and her manipulation, only to have her come-uppance as Klaus compelled her, have been *rich* to watch.

But now that Elena's life is closer and closer to the threat of death, Damon's unrequited love is affecting his judgment and his behavior in increasingly wild, desperate, and unpredictable ways. The poignancy of his hopeless feelings for her, and the fact that it ""will always be Stefan"" for her, and the fact that that hasn't stopped him, has been fairly gripping over the last couple of episodes, and The Last Day was no exception.

And, finally, it is fairly tear-jerking when you realize how little time Stefan and Elena have had together, and how much Elena has already lost in her life -- in terms of deaths of loved ones, of family -- as she gets closer and closer to Klaus' ritual.

I guess I can once again relate to Elena, as she seems about to (once again) lose so much, including her own life, as well as the lives of those around her. I guess having been through the deaths of several loved ones over the last few years, I relate far less to her happy kissy-face times with Stefan and relate far more to her doomy gloomy times like now... Which is my own crap, of which I'm totally aware and fully admit.

But then, as Matt Groening (creator of Life In Hell long before he created The Simpsons and Futurama) once said, Happiness is boring... to which I'd add, happiness is also not very dramatically challenging; it doesn't drive plot or character development the way tragedy and danger do, that's for sure.

And before everyone jumps down my throat, yeah, yeah, I get that Stefan and Elena are supposed to be the main focus of the show -- but then again, they're not; it's an ensemble cast; and I'm glad that the other characters and actors really got to develop and shine this season. Plus having to play Katarina/Katherine in addition to the sometimes almost annoyingly-nice Elena has shown more than anything that Nina Dobrev really can act; watching her go from playing innocent, trusting, let's-make-a-deal Elena to playing the scheming, selfish, manipulative Katherine has been a rather delightful surprise throughout this season. And just when the polar opposite behavior of those two characters was getting predictable, they had Katherine pretend to be Elena, so Nina Dobrev had to play Kathareine playing Elena -- and the disdain Katherine had for Elena's nature (right after convincingly pretending to *be* her) was both hilarious and also quite compelling. It was quite fascinating to watch Nina navigate those parts so well.

Yet, still, my heart goes out most to Damon, because it will never be him for Elena... but he's willing to risk her undying hatred in order to save her ""by any means necessary."" That's pretty big love, in my book; a pretty damn big sacrifice -- far more, imo, than Stefan has made or will make. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for the bad guy with the good heart.",1304640000,,5385,4.6998939554612935

Until I actually sat down and watched it.
VD, (funny acronyms aside) I am happy to admit, was everything that Twilight dribble was not: it treated teens seriously, (as Buffy the Vampire Slayer did) realistically and was not afraid to explore controversial subjects. This show does not depict teens as vapid, angsty and shallow, (although some of the characters do start that way). It takes the vampire genre, (Dracula, Anne Rice, True Blood) and the teen TV show genre (90210, Dawson's Creek, Party of Five) and gives it a fresh and supernatural spin. Its refreshing to see a show where the characters have real-life motivations, actually portraying the glories and perils of adolescence. It does not shy away from topics such as drug use, unprotected sex, racism and promiscuity. It blends adolescent and adult characters with great care and realism. It is nice to actually watch a show that makes me want to come back for more, that actually cares about the subject and the viewer. Major characters struggle, suffer and actually die; this is not a soap opera. Bravo for Vampire Diaries! Cannot wait for season 3. I just hope they keep these writers happy and that the formula continues.

What I like the best is Ian Somerhalder, Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley dynamic and the terrific acting they give every episode.  The Twilight series annoys me in that their characters are not believeable....and when Bella and Edward are in a scene together there is no chemistry....sad but true.  When Elena and Stephan or Elena and Daemon are together the sparks are flying....I believe the characters because the acting is great and the supporting cast is wonderful as well ....and they are sexy and hot which gives all something to look forward to each week.

It's kind of a cross between the two other series:  it doesn't have the persistent longing and heartbreak (part of the ""cheese factor,"" which is fun, but which can be overbearing) that are throughout the Twilight series, and yet isn't as graphic as True Blood.  That being said, it's definitely it's own very unique show.

The character development is really fantastic on TVD, and each episode really focuses on drawing out intricacies of each personality.  Also, there are a lot of plot lines to follow and characters that appear and then re-appear, which make for an interesting story arc.  Additionally, the central characters also have a complexity to them that is missing from some other series.

Like 90210, I had a hard time buying into the notion that in a school of hundreds of students, only 6-7 students mattered to anyone there.  The Damien character irritated me severely but actually proved to be the character with the most depth, as the series continued.  Stefen is too ""Edward Cullen"" for me.  I can't help but think they could have been more original in providing the love interest of heroine, Elena, as ""True Blood"" did Sookie, w/ Bill. Dobrev is clearly the most beautiful heroine in a trendy genre that also includes ""True Blood"" and all ""Twilight"" sagas.  I watch it mainly for her.  I was very dissapointed to see the petite, cute and intellectual, Chino-American vampire leave the show. I always looked forward to her character as well. I also resented that they allowed lovely, Mia Kirchner to be so maternal and homely. I'm mainly sticking around for Dobrev and Candace Accola at this point, hoping for some improvement in the vampire erotica scenes.  The original air time ""sucks"" unless you're a teen.  I have to watch it on dvd after prime-time.",1296172800,,1265,4.76605504587156
4144070,5,B003L77GHE,"I have to admit before I started watching the Vampire Diaries I had my doubts that it would capture my attention.  I was watching it with my neice one day and I got hooked.  Damon is by far my favorite character, when he gets pissed, people tend to die.  I like the buddy relationship between Rick the History teacher, Damon and Stefan's vampire weapons provider.  Season two is hands down better than season one, I like the way the characters interact with each other, and I'm never bored.  When a show ends, I'm upset that I have to wait for the next week.  When Caroline was turned into a vampire I had my doubts that she would become a major player, but I like her character so much more than the first season. I wasn't very impress with Nina Dobrey's potrayal of Elena, but she has really shown her range as an actress playing Katherine.  Katherine is one evil bitch and she will hurt, kill, or damage anyone to get her way. It's fun to watch the happenings of Mystic Falls, but I would never want to live there.",1295568000,3,1017,4.349206349206349
4144071,5,B003L77GHE,"The books may have been geared towards teenagers (which I am not one) but the TV series stands up to the best of the best on the air right now.  It has been years since any show has captivated me or my friends where we count down the days, then the hours, until showtime.  Well written plots move very fast, which means if you actually miss an episode, you better download it off iTunes before the next episode.  If you can look past the stunningly beautiful cast, you will be pleasantly surprised at the talent and chemistry stuffed into one hour.  There have been moments of shock, moments of love, moments of warm fuzzies that will stay with you for days.

I have made it a goal to introduce everyone I care about to TVDs and I have yet to fail in my quest to convert them into fans.  I get thanked repeatedly.  I've even brought on new Twitter people to follow the cast since most of them are active tweeters.  So if you have some mind block where you won't tune in because its in the middle of Season 2, or you think its for preteens, you are dead wrong.  Currently on Thursday at 8 pm EST on The CW.  Watch it... you may even dream about it because it is that good.",1293494400,15,1171,4.1875
4144072,4,B003L77GHE,This was an excellent episode.  It wasn't predictable and left a lot of questions yet to be answered.  Wonderful werewolf transformation segment.,1292112000,2,145,5.545454545454546
4144073,3,B003L77GHE,"Sorry, this series is a guilty pleasure for me, but it really really bothers me that ""wolfsbane"" is shown to be a yellow plant with small, pollen-like flowers that attach closely to the stem and that isn't toxic to humans.

""Wolfsbane"" is a real plant, also known as aconite or monkshood. It's cultivated in many gardens for it's hardy nature and pretty flowers... The most common variety is purple. It's also HIGHLY toxic to humans, although someone who's very well trained can extract the poison to use it safely in medicines. But even they have to be careful because pure aconite extracted from the plant is poisonous enough that if it gets into a small cut on your skin it can be fatal. DON'T try giving someone wolfsbane at home, kids! Not even as a joke. There is a very real possibility that it will kill them.

Even if I didn't already personally know that, I could have found it out very quickly by looking at Wikipedia. So it's not ""a hard to track down herb."" Even in the rare, yellow varieties the flowers are shaped very differently than that, and giving a human aconite to check to see if they're actually a werewolf is like dunking a witch into a frozen pond to see if she's a witch. Even if they aren't, they're likely to die. Please do some research, writers and prop people. This is common knowledge to anyone who's a werewolf, paranormal geek, and also to people who garden. Little details like that can serious help with suspension of disbelief.",1292112000,,1465,4.566539923954372

Every hour was better than the previous one and I just couldn't stop watching. First, I was a bit annoyed that the Tv-version is so different than the book. But as I watched more and got deeper into it, it didn't matter at all. If you like stuff like this... you must buy this one!

Maybe because I am not a total Fan of Twilight. I see the movie all of them, but still to cheesy. Anyway, the true this show got better and better. When I came back to watch this show, I just rent one of them, to see if I give a chance, and that was it, I have to see them all. Great job, really nice version of the two kind of vampire tales. You don't know which one to like more, the true vampire Damon, or the more humane vampire Stefan. I love it, actually even more than True Blood sometimes.",1289174400,7,648,3.9923076923076923

4144204,5,B003L77GHE,"I purchased an Itunes season pass for Vampire Diaries Season 2 and couldn't be more sorry. I paid $50 and yet I have to wait a full 2 days after the episodes air before Itunes will send them to me.

Yet they are available on Amazon.com the very next day after they air!! So, I've been so frustrated I've ended up purchasing them at Amazon and couldn't be happier with Amazon - except thanks to Itunes lousy customer service, I can't get a refund and I have to pay twice for this season!

It's a no brainer - if Amazon has access the very next day to the episode, so does Itunes but Itunes doesn't care about customer service; Amazon does.

To top it off CT TV airs the episodes for free on their website 2 days or so later, so why did I pay Itunes $50 if I have to wait the same amount of time and I could watch it for free? Because I didn't do my homework.

Amazon gives you a season pass, you only wait til the next day, and no commercials.

Itunes makes you wait two days for something you could watch for free with only 4 commercials.

I'll never buy anything from ITUNES again - Amazon has my loyalty now.

Great series by the way - lots of cliffhangers that makes waiting an extra two days for Itunes a raw deal.",1288915200,,1218,4.113924050632911

So many shows seem to drag on with the storyline with not anything new really happening. Not ""The Vampire Diaries"". The show and the storyline is always fresh and never boring. The writers do a excellent job. I was literally in awe watching this episode. Second, the acting is superb. I mean they continue to surprise me every week.

So far the show has manage to avoid the sophomore jinks and it still holding good. I do not know if the writers are seasoned or if it is because most of the ensemble is so talented but I have yet to be disappointed. Even though considerable changes have been made in regards to the books; the writers seem to know that these changes have been a benefit not a hinder like Allan Ball created with True Blood.,1288051200,15,505,4.163265306122449

My grand daughter wasn't interested until I let her borrow my complete 1st season> now she is hooked and says she likes it just as much as the Twilight series. Even wants to read the books. She is waiting for the 2nd season to come out on DVD because she didn't watch the first 2 episodes but won't watch it now until she can see them all. I am buying her the set so I can keep mine. This is the best and if you like vampires you will love this. I couldn't get into watching True Blood cause the characters were not how I thought they would be and the character Sookie tries to hard with the southern accent and she just doesn't fit my idea as the character.,1286582400,7,713,4.1

The characters are wonderful, even though they are all gorgeous and money never seems to be a problem, and neither is curfew. College would have been a more realistic setting for the characters.  Then again, its a series about vampires, werewolves, and witches, so a little more suspension of disbelief is not all that hard.  This season starts right as the first ended, at the carnival.  I anticipate each episode being better than the previous.  I love re-watching the first season, you discover new details each time you watch them.  Sit back and enjoy!
