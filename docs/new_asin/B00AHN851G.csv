8551696,5,B00AHN851G,"Along with Part one, these are well done videos on how animatronics is created. Rick Lazzarini is a skilled builder and talks in plain English so that anyone can understand. I really enjoyed this video series! ( You need to watch part one first. This is part two)",1401062400,,263,4.5
8551697,5,B00AHN851G,This DVD is incredible and I am so grateful that Stan Winston and Jim Henson are teaming up. We need Part 3! Cant wait to get started making cool things.,1400284800,,153,4.133333333333334
8551698,5,B00AHN851G,"Awsome stuff. Combined with part one, this is an eight hour master class. The only thing I didn't like about it was it didn't have anything about the blinks and eye movement. Happily I have got that knowledge from elsewhere, but everything else in this dvd series meets the expectations of excellence that people generally have of Stan Winston Studios.",1377907200,2,352,4.883333333333334
