8428863,5,B004GN8XOC,"This is a profile of Charles Hamilton Houston, the Black lawyer who masterminded the legal fight for equal rights for African-Americans. I truly enjoyed this documentary and it was wonderful to hear and see the heroes of civil rights and the battles and struggles they faced. It gives me an ever greater appreciation for my Constitutional rights and the importance of those who have been willing to stand up and fight even when the Supreme Court denies them. Those who have worked and who will continue to keep justice and freedom in view despite whatever false framework is accepted in society and in the Court. This is a must see -even for those who think the phrase ""It's the law."" should be enough to stop a conversation on important matters even today.",1383868800,2,757,4.742424242424242
