8259679,3,B0015RRNKW,"The six DVD set ""WWII War In The Pacific"" contains 15 documentary films from the 1940's.  The films deal with the pacific war against Japan.  Fourteen of them are made by various US Government agencies; one is a newsreel.  These are sometimes called ""propaganda films"" since they were subject to wartime censorship.  As far as I can determine, all these films are in the public domain.  The advertising that these DVDs contain ""unedited footage"" is false.  Obviously the footage was edited when it was put into a documentary.

(Whether the National Archives contains the raw reels of film that were the basis for these documentaries is an interesting question.  I hope someone knows the answer and will add a comment to this review to inform us.  As to the product advertisement quoting ""Les Waffen, Chief Motion Picture Sound & Video Branch, National Archives and Records Administration"", it would be interesting to know what, if anything, Les or any of his staff actually had to do with this product.  The DVDs have the brand of a company whose website is topics-ent dot com.)

Most of the footage on these films will be familiar to long time TV viewers. TV stations of the 1950's and 1960's broadcast such films to fill gaps in programming.  Many modern documentaries have been made by taking excerpts from these old films and replacing the audio with new narration spoken by retired actors.

There is ample footage of the war.  There are also staged scenes in some of the films.  Apparently war footage was usually silent.  Music, narration and sound effects have been added to the scenes of combat.  After you watch a few hours of these films, you will have the impression that you are hearing the same explosions, screaming dive bombers etc. over and over again.  True to WWII vernacular, the narrators usually refer to the Japanese as ""the japs"", so be warned if that offends you.  There are a few places on the audio where a rhythmic hissing sound occurs.  It sounds like a film is being played on an actual film projector.  I didn't mind that. A few of the films are in color, but the color isn't impressive by modern standards.

I rate this set of DVDs as three stars out of five to indicate that it is an average job or repacking public domain films.  The DVDs are single sided.  I like the quality of the individual cases.  On a computer, I was able to watch each DVD using the ""play all"" option, but on some DVDs the option to play individual films didn't work under Microsoft Media Player.

I don't penalized this product for its advertising.  People who expect truth in advertising from non-ficition publishers are going against tradition.  I'm also not rating the product based on a critical appraisal of the films - either of their historical accuracy or their entertainment value.  I assume consumers will know what they are getting in that respect.  (You can find reviews of many of them on the web and you can probably download many of them for free.)
