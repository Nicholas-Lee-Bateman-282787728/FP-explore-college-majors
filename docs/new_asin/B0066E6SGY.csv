4962023,3,B0066E6SGY,"Warner Archive brings us another of Elizabeth Montgomery's CBS TV-Movies in a Manufacture-on-Demand DVD-R with 1993's ""The Black Widow Murders: The Blanche Taylor Moore Story"".

The fullscreen print looks great but this is a rather lacklustre production. Liz's character is a middle-aged, lower-middle-class Southern widow who has become bored with her boyfriend and slowly begins poisoning him so she can profit from his death and take up with the new minister in town. It's not long before her cycle of murder starts all over again.

I'm a big ""Bewitched"" fan and my favorite Liz movie is ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" but by this time the novelty of her playing wicked characters has worn off, and the script is rather dull. We just have one scene after another; there's no real suspense here or investment in any of the characters. The best moments occur when Liz confronts her boss at a discount store about his sexual harrassment of her co-worker and when she sits at the bedside of a terminally ill friend played by Grace Zabriskie.

For completists who want to see and own every film she's ever done. The more casual Liz fans should skip this one; it's nothing special and not a very satisfying watch. If you still want it, check the price at the Warner Archive site first; I got mine for much less than what's being charged here.",1326672000,3,1338,4.758620689655173

4962047,4,B0066E6SGY,"Aside from Warner going the cheapie DVD-R route on this, I would note that akin to the rumors of Paul McCartney's death (which came out about this time), I noted subtle differences in Derwood as of Sept 1969.  His face seemed somewhat longer, and his voice - his inflections were somewhat different.  Apparently it was so subtle, that neither daughter Tabitha, or employer Larry Tate seemed to notice.  But I am convinced Samantha's witchy inclinations caught up with her, and that our Derwood, the real Derwood, met with an unfortunate fate.",1455235200,,542,4.934065934065934

4962053,5,B0066E6SGY,"You will be shocked at how well Elizabeth Montgomery can flip-flop her personality and behavior from a hard-core right wing Christian to a scheming murderer. It is an excellent depiction of a true story!
I cannot give enough credit to Elizabeth Montgomery in her versatility when you only thought she could smile, wiggle her nose and make magic happen. Her acting is ""magic"" in this story. Some may consider this a documentary, but much life is brought into the story by our star. Definitely worth the investment. Enjoy!",1434499200,2,520,4.920454545454546

4962074,5,B0066E6SGY,"Elizabeth Montgomery is mesmerizing as Blanche Taylor Moore.  If you're a fan of hers then I highly recommend.  But if you only like her in roles like Samantha from Bewitched, then you'll probably dislike this.  This is based on a true story.  You do feel bad though for this character because with seeing flashbacks of her childhood you get to understand why she dislikes men in general.  I won't give away the plotline.",1411948800,10,421,4.712328767123288

4962077,4,B0066E6SGY,I really enjoyed this movie and think that Elizabeth Montgomery did an outstanding job.  Anxiously awaiting for Lizzie Borden to be released.  I watched it on television many years ago and can't understand why it's taken so long to come out on DVD.  Elizabeth Montgomery was a wonderful actress and apparently could go from comedy to creepy and be believable.,1407369600,7,359,4.95

4962105,5,B0066E6SGY,"One of Elizabeth Montgomery's best movies.  A real character study into the mind of a mad woman.  (Mad at men, ha!)  To think the main character is still alive is scary.",1392854400,,169,4.387096774193548

4962108,3,B0066E6SGY,I found this movie a little lacking in umph. I felt it needed more than what it gave the audience.,1380672000,,98,3.95

4962111,5,B0066E6SGY,Very good movie!  A lot of that type of action still happens today.  Elizabeth Montgomery played a very good role!,1370390400,,114,4.65
4962112,3,B0066E6SGY,It is Strange to see the dark side in her acting roles and although not as strong as her Lizzie Borden role I felt it was intresting to try the movie out.,1362787200,2,154,3.84375
4962113,5,B0066E6SGY,"Among many other Elizabeth Montgomery fans, I echo their comments that this is a very juicy role for Lizzie, and she does it justice.  Although, this movie is great, I think her protrayal of Ruth Coe in 'Sins of the Mother' was better.  It boggles my mind how talented Lizzie was, from playing sweet loveable Samamtha Stephens on 'Bewitched', to a deranged individual that lives in her own world.  Lizzie left us way too soon.",1335744000,3,426,4.653333333333333
4962114,4,B0066E6SGY,"Following her tour-de-force performance in ""The Legend Of Lizzie Borden"" (1975), Elizabeth Montgomery seemed to specialize in playing evil ladies in TV movies. As Blanche Taylor Moore, the subject of this 1993 true-crime TV movie, Montgomery skillfully combines the charms of her character Samantha from the TV Sitcom ""Bewitched"" (1964-1972) with the murderous intentions of Lizzie Borden. But Blanche, a preacher's daughter with a God complex and sociopathic personality, makes axe-murderess Lizzie Borden look like a saint.
  We first see Blanche set fire to her own house; she says ""some pervert"" must have done it. Next, we see her in session with her psychiatrist. Boy, it would take at least fifty psychiatrists to figure Blanche out. The teleplay  by Judith Paige Mitchell, based on a non-fiction book by Jim Schutze, never really makes Blanche's motivations for multiple murders clear. All we know is that she hated her preacher father because he comitted adultrey and left her mother and started a family with another woman. It appears that she decided to kill Raymond Reid (John M. Jackson), her devoted boyfriend of eleven years, simply because she was bored with him.  Blanche behaves shrewishly to Raymond and, simultaneously, she behaves like a fragile Southern belle in her attempts to charm and deceive the Reverend Dwight Moore (David Clennon). When Moore tells Blanche he divorced his first wife after having a long extra-marital affair (exactly as Blanche's father had done to her mother), she decides to kill him, too. Blanche obviously forgot the Bible's commandment ""Thou Shalt Not Kill."" God may forgive people their sins, but Blanche, acting as judge, jury, and executioner, never does. One wonders why angry Blanche didn't also try to kill her male chauvanist boss at the grocery store-- now, he is a real scum-bag!
  When Moore starts coming down with the same symptoms that killed poor Raymond (slow deadly poisoning), police detectives start putting several decades' worth of pieces together, and the movie turns into a dark comedy. As the dead bodies of Raymond, Blanche's father, and first husband James Taylor are all dug up, a police detective glibly refers to the cemetery as the ""Blanche Moore landfill."" Also, scenes of Blanche poisoning both Raymond and Dwight are juxtaposed with Blanche singing hymns in church; usually ""Rock Of Ages"". I couldn't help but laugh at the deliberate, wicked irony. Elizabeth Montgomery is chillingly mesmerizing as sick, twisted Blanche. The real Blanche, a preacher's daughter who really deserves to burn in hell, remains on death row.",1329609600,21,2604,5.232613908872902
8493871,5,B0066E6SGY,"I'm a big fan of non-fiction movies.  I have other true-crime movies that star Elizabeth Montgomery & she is spectacular in all of them.  I am watching this movie tonight for the third time; it's that good.  The story is very well told & the supporting cast also did a superb job.
This is the story of Blanche Taylor Moore who has the distinction of being the oldest person on death row, at 85.",1526428800,,394,4.297297297297297

8493877,5,B0066E6SGY,"These murders by Blanche Taylor Moore occurred just a few miles from my home in Greensboro, NC. Blanche is still alive and on death row 30 some years after the murders. I loved this movie because the true story happened ""in my own back yard"" figuratively speaking. I knew one of the men she poisoned with Anti Ant.
