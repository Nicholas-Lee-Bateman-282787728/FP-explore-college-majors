2953651,5,B000VV2830,"I have an Undergraduate Degree in Psychology and a Master's Degree in Business Administration. I have taught at both the Collegiate (Adjunct) and Junior High School level. That said this Documentary is spot on and deadly accurate.  It exposes this industry for what it really is.....a multi billion dollar fraud and a cruel hoax!

The field of Psychiatry has absolutely no basis in Science. Sigmund Freud, the
`Father of Psychology"" was a Cocaine addict and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), this industry's ""Bible"", comes right out of the Nazi death camps!

This documentary is must viewing by every American man, woman and child. I recommend you view it and after the shock wears off, share it with family and friends. Make it viral!

As a Naturopathic Practitioner & Educator, I have seen the debilitating effects of Ritalin and antidepressants, first hand. There are over 250,000 Americans currently on anti-depressant and over 37,000 children. And this number is growing exponentially. When you pull back the curtain on just about every school shooting and mass murder, you'll find........antidepressants. From Columbine, to Virginia Tech, to the most recent Chimpanzee attack (Zanax)!

The first reaction, after the Virginia Tech shooting, was a recommendation to screen, future incoming students and to medicate accordingly (antidepressant). Teen screen is an active program, at the high school level. The government is currently considering a bill which would force all new mothers to be put on antidepressants. Newborns, as young as 6 months old, are being put on antidepressants. As are household pets.

Sadly, we are all on antidepressants, Chemo therapy, birth control drugs, hormones, antibiotics, steroids, etc. Since, these chemical substances cannot be filtered out of our water supply. The government is also considering adding antidepressants to our water supply. Fluoride is a mind control substance, already in our water supply. 80% of an antidepressant drug is Fluoride! Fluoride was first used by the Russians and then the Nazi's, to control populations.

One thing that needs to be made clear, is that there is no exit strategy with antidepressants. Once you are on them, you are on them for life! As you begin to experience cognitive decline and the inevitable side effects, you will find yourself on a cocktail of drugs to counter the side affects to the side affects. Trying to get off these powerful drugs is a nightmare, in and of itself. There are the seizures, thoughts of suicide and thoughts of outward violence.

So, what is the true underlying cause of this ""epidemic"" of Depression? (1) An industry run amok, (2) a Eugenics agenda, (3) Corporate greed and finally (4) the ""Standard American Diet"", (SAD). A diet totally devoid of nutrients and fiber and loaded with fat, hydrogenated oils, sugar, artificial sweeteners (Aspartame), chemical additives and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). This is really all about the ""food mood connection"". Change your diet and the depression goes away, along with a slew of other maladies. It's that simple! St. John's Wort, 5HTP, SAMe, Valerian root and Fish oils, have all been clinically proven to combat depression.

As an Army Officer, I took an oath to protect and defend this great, nation from enemies foreign and domestic. This industry is a domestic enemy! In my opinion, it is an integral and crucial part of the ""New World Order"" cabal, hell bent on dumbing down, bankrupting, overthrowing and enslaving our great nation. It's time they were exposed!

I highly recommend: Making A Killing: The Untold Story of Psychotropic Drugging, Generation RX, Eating 3rd Edition, Healing Cancer from Inside Out, End Game, Vaccine Nation and Medisin (Book).

I give this documentary, five stars! Watch it and pass it on.",1243382400,24,3805,5.211129296235679
2953652,2,B000VV2830,"This product was sent to schools as a free sample to educate students.  I viewed the whole documentary and although it is very entertaining, flashy and contains historical information, it is presented in an incredibly biased and misleading fashion.  It is not a careful historical or intellectual analysis of the real issues regarding mental illness and how to treat it, but a one sided argumentation against all aspects of psychiatry.  Current psychiatrists and psychologists are tied to all efforts to help the mentally ill and compared to everyone from the KKK, to Nazi war criminals, murders, and Hitler.  The nice thing about science is that it is open for discussion and review - all of the information present in this documentary are things discussed in the field.  I think what should really be said about this documentary is that it is put out by the Citizens Commission on Human Rights... which was an organization created by Scientologists.  Scientology by its very nature does not like nor believe in psychotherapy or biological therapy for problems.  As an instructor I was happy that they bring up the key ethical issues and problems with mental disorders (as any good psychology course would) but saddened by the fact that it isn't a documentary, but propaganda.",1241481600,7,1277,5.023696682464455
