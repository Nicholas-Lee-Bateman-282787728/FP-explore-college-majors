8326563,5,B001LY7D04,"By far the best film by Jorge Fons, with an amazing performance by Ignacio Lopez Tarso, Los Alba&ntilde;iles is a journey to the grim reality of the Mexican construction worker, a film that was done in the mid seventies that exposes the competence of the corrupt government, society values, police brutality, and the dishonesty of labor unions, issues that until this day are a problem that surrounds and affects every Mexican specially the working class. Around all this darkness comes Don Jesus, a watchman who works in a construction site is murdered, and in the investigation comes to light every character that worked with him (Jacinto, Sergio, El Patotas) each with a story that is not hard to find in the reality of the Mexican working class. A must have.",1496448000,,762,4.869230769230769
8326564,5,B001LY7D04,"Top notch performances from an all-star cast makes this Mexican whodunnit a cinematic gem. A nightswatchman is murdered in a Mexico City construction site, and the subsequent investigation serves as sociology study of subtle racism and class warfare amid Mexican society. All characters, from the coarse bricklayers to the crippled politico-developer, ring true to life, and so does the police work exposed, for -keep in mind- this is a MEXICAN whodunnit!

Screenplay by Vicente Leero from his own novel of the same title. Jorge Fons directs. Standing ovation!!!",1442102400,,562,5.386363636363637
