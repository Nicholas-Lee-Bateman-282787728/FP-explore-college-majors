5101561,5,B007OCD1CG,"Yes, I have several simply red concerts, including some older dvd simply red's where you enjoy them,,,, but they leave you wishing for DIGITAL SOUND/ and maybe DIGITAL PICTURE! WELL,,,,,, here it is, at long last! The stage is smaller giving much better grouping of the band shots, and as far as his voice???? the least of your concerns. For some odd reason, I found the 5.1 digital sound to play better than the DTS-HD,,, go figure? Both are good but the later took the edge. Screen shots are well placed and not an over excessive camera movement as others. Sound in the DTS mode was no where close to like Roy Orbison black and white (blue ray)but the 5.1 digital (7.1 enhanced) was oddly more enjoyable than the DTS. Lots of familiar faces in the band, lighting was ok for the stage, could of been better but you still see the HD quality for sure. My other dvd's will be retired now of simply red. Great dvd, long time waiting for this!",1342396800,9,939,4.433526011560693
5101562,5,B007OCD1CG,"As the great philosopher Billy Joel once said, ""It's all about soul.""

It's clear that Simply Red's lead singer, Mick Hucknall, knows this to be true.  He doesn't just sing songs: he feels them.  Because of this, it's pretty much impossible not to be mesmerized by his silky smooth vocal - one that hasn't diminished in power or range since Simply Red's inception in 1985.

""Simply Red: Live at Montreux 2003"" captures the band supporting their then latest studio outing, ""Home"".  Six of the tracks from that LP are included in this show's set list, including a cover of The Stylistic's ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" that is one of the show's two best moments.  Given that the original song featured three different vocalists singing in three different vocal ranges, it's a hearty challenge for one guy to perform the song - especially in a live setting.  But, from note one, it's clear that Hucknall's multi-octave voice can handle all three vocal parts perfectly and that a sole singer can deliver a version that's equally as good - if not better - than the original.

But ""Holding Back the Years"" - penned when Hucknall was a mere 17 years of age - is the show-stopper.  Performed as the first song of the encore set, Hucknall wanders back onto a stage devoid of other musicians, slowly strumming an acoustic guitar.  The two chords he gently plays are generic enough to be undistinguishable as any specific song - until he sings and, mid-way through, is joined by the rest of his band mates.  In a day and age of ""unplugged"" renditions, this one avoids being clich and stands out as a great reinterpretation of a timeless classic - and one that clearly demonstrates why Simply Red were one of the best bands to come out of the 80's.

By the time this show was recorded, Mick Hucknall was the only original member left in Simply Red, but the 2003 iteration of Simply Red is comprised of a solid group of great musicians that work together flawlessly.  The same line-up is featured on the Blu-ray's closing segment culled from the band's 2010 farewell tour.  Unfortunately, only seven tracks from this show are included as not to double-up on any songs that appeared in the 2003 show.  It would have been great to have the full concert - dupes and all.

The usual array of audio options that we've come to expect from Eagle Vision releases are all here: LPCM stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS-HD.  Each have a superior range of dynamics and are superbly mixed.  Both the 2003 and 2010 shows were filmed in high-definition and the resulting 1080i video transfer is crisp and clean and the editing perfectly matches the show's pacing and overall mood.

Since the demise of Simply Red, Hucknall has become a member of a newly reformed Faces, replacing Rod Stewart.  Even though his onstage persona is nowhere near as flamboyant as Rod the Mod's, it's hard to imagine a better choice to carry that seminal band in a new and fruitful direction.  Despite his immense vocal prowess, Hucknall has always proven that all one needs to lull the listener in with a vocal is one that is powerfully heartfelt and unpretentiously delivered.  In that regard, he is - and Simply Red was - simply amazing.",1338163200,23,3188,4.665474060822898

8519847,5,B007OCD1CG,"My dad is obsessed with collecting Blu ray concerts from his favorite artists ranging from the 70s to the 90s. I grew up with that music so I became fan of the music of those times. When he played this blu ray disc it was nostalgic for me. It took me back to my childhood days, traveling across the Atacama desert in Chile and the vineyards of Mendoza through Argentina with this music. I am 20 and this concert made me fall in love with Simply Red again. Im obsessed especially since there is a lot of awful music out there nowadays. This is high quality, great sound, Mick Hucknall gives such a fun performance! I am looking forward to purchasing the concert the played at the Sydney Opera House!!",1485129600,,699,4.384615384615385
