2453559,4,B000C65YUS,"Ultimate Fighting Championship  (UFC) 2 once again takes place in Denver, Colorado, but at a different arena.  This time there are 16 fighters, instead of 8, with the winner receiving $60,000.  It is a tournament again with Style vs Style. And Royce Gracie is back, to defend his tournament win from UFC 1.  Will he do it?

The DVD starts off with a recap of 7 of the preliminary bouts.  The 3 announcers quickly go over the 14 fighters, their styles and who won.  For me, this was the only real disappointing thing about the DVD.  I don't see why they did not put all the fights on the DVD.  I can see why during the PPV for time constraints, but this is a DVD, and there is room for it.  Later, in the Special Features section of the DVD, they show 3 of the fights, but we still miss out on 4.

After the recap, they show the 8th bout of the tournament:  Minoki Ichihara (Karate) vs Royce Grace (Jiu-Jitsu).  Royce quickly takes Minoki down, and eventually submits him by armbar.

Next comes a recap of the differnt styles that will be on display in the Quarterfinals.  They show a short segment on each of the 5 styles: Karate, Kickboxing, Kung Fu, Grapplers, and Exotics (ninja).  This was informative for any new fans out there.

Now the Quarterfinal Matchups:
Scott Morris (ninja) vs Pat Smith (Kickboxing)
Johnny Rhodes (Karate) vs Fred Ettish (Karate)
Orlando Weit (Kickboxing) vs Remco Pardoel (grappler)
Jason DeLucia (Kung Fu) vs Royce Gracie (Jiu-Jitsu)

There were some great matchups in this UFC with some crazy knockouts and cool submissions.  The ending to the Remco/Orlando fight is worth watching this DVD alone.  The announcing team were a little better this UFC, but definitely not up to the fluidity that we currently see on Spike or the PPV's.  This UFC also featured the debut of Big John McCarthy as the referee.  I felt bad for the guy, because he refs every single bout.

For UFC 2, the disc still lacks alot of features.  There are the fights, and then a Special Features section.  The Special Features has an interview with Hall of Famer Royce Gracie,and then a Bonus Fights/Alternate Angles Part.  But as I mentioned before, they only show 3 of the 7 preliminary bouts.

Overall, a great experience for the mixed martial arts fan of the ""early days"".",1217116800,6,2279,4.604477611940299
2453560,5,B000C65YUS,"UFC 2 features the return of UFC veterans Royce Gracie,Pat Smith,and Jason Delucia along with 13 newcomers in a 16 man single elimination tournament format.
Gracie and hometown fighter Smith are the top seeded fighters in the tournament with Ken Shamrock taking in the action at cageside with a broken hand eagerly waiting for his return to the octagon. Smith; who was one of the favorites to win UFC 1 has improved his grappling skills since the last event and has Redemption'94 written on his shorts.
The rules are still limited; with no rounds and no weight classes. The winner gets $60,000.00 dollars!",1203465600,,605,4.883495145631068
2453561,4,B000C65YUS,"Remember these names... Fred Ettish and Scott Morris...

Some of the most severe beatings in MMA/NHB history occured at this second event of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the organization that rocked the martial arts world... It was a 16 man tournament, and it is probably the best.  This is the best of the early UFC events, and the one that initiated me into the world of mixed martial arts when it debuted.  Style vs. Style at its best, before the dogma of style was destroyed forever...

As much as I enjoyed the show, I was disappointed that this update version did not include the first eight preliminary bouts.  I was really wanting to see the Hammaker (Sambo) vs. (Pencat Silat) bout... no dice...

That's the only reason it gets a 4... It is still an absolute must for any martial arts fan.",1181088000,,805,4.633802816901408
2453562,5,B000C65YUS,"UFC 2.  An event like no other.  The only 16-man tournament in the history of the event, and the most brutal, vicious sporting event I've seen in my life.

A hapless 18-year-old gets a harsh education on what ""showing up"" means.  Robert Lucarelli takes a beatdown, doesn't tap out properly, and suffers a second beatdown.  Minoki Ichihara sees his entire fighting style rendered useless by Royce Gracie.  Then Patrick Smith gets a piece of Scott Morris, and it's not pretty.  And of course, Remco Pardoel vs. Orlando ""The Gladiator"" Weit, which produced the first truly frightening moment of this young event.

Faces get smashed in, arms get wrenched, and blood flows freely.  In the end, however, it comes down not to violence, but skill.  That's the beauty of it.

Note: The DVD has three first round matches other than what was shown on the PPV, which had to be shortened due to time constraints.",1174780800,4,899,4.7727272727272725
2453563,4,B000C65YUS,"I had these on video and the dvd's are the same quality with some interviews added. Just to clarify UFC classics 2 does contain the very last match of the first round.

2453564,3,B000C65YUS,"I was very excited to see the original UFC's on DVD!  I was disappointed with this one though, because the first round of fights are left off!  The DVD starts off with the second round of fights.  This is disappointing since this is the only UFC that had four rounds of fights!",1142553600,9,277,4.288461538461538
2453565,4,B000C65YUS,"This would have gotten 5 stars from me if there would have been a bit more in the production value. Not much in the way of special features here, which is really sad when you stop and think about how rich this could have been with more interviews. Otherwise, this is a must own simply because it is something historic... a new sport was forged here.",1139356800,2,349,4.303030303030303

2453567,5,B000C65YUS,"Even if Royce happens to lose to matt hughes, he is still the greatest ufc fighter of all time, he ruled the octagon when there was no rules, no time limits, no rounds, and when u got choked by him or arm barred it was the real thing.  Hopefully he still fights with that same intensity, and he will teach the young great hughes a lesson.  Hughes probably wouldn't even be champ now if they hadn't got rid of Evye Edwards. The best out of the first five is the third and the fourth one, where my man and underated Keith Hackney showed that he was no joke.  UFC is the house the Royce Gracie built and always will be!!!!!!",1138060800,4,621,4.158333333333333
2453568,5,B000C65YUS,"Now that Royce is returning to take on Matt Hughes, we should all look back at UFC 1,2 and 4 to review his style. This UFC is the old days of little rules and tournament style matches. Royce had to defeat 4 men in one night to win this tournament. Do not underestimate him! He is a true legend of MMC and a founding father of the UFC.",1137542400,3,334,3.926470588235294

8096008,1,B000C65YUS,"- The video looks washed out. It is very irritating.

- All the fights in this DVD are boring because they end very quickly. It is because the fighters possess extremely unbalanced skills. In every fight, there is always one who is very skillful and the other is inexperienced.

- Furthermore, at that time, there is no fight category, i.e. no heavy weight or middle weight title. So, there are some fights with huge difference in weight. For example, a guy with 159 pounds fought another guy with 260 pounds! Of course, you can easily predict the outcome.",1393200000,,556,4.663265306122449

8096012,4,B000C65YUS,"In this second UFC, there are still very clear indications that Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) was in its infancy.  Weight and skill mismatches were ridiculous, and just like UFC 1, it appears that only Royce Gracie had any sort of clue about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ).  Overall, the action was a mere fraction of today's fights, but the excitement of the unknown, and the hope for a MMA future, made this event jaw droppingly awesome.

Aside from Gracie's dominating performances where he proved that skill and knowledge trump strength and speed, here are my favorite fights:

Patrick Smith vs. Scott Morris is a brutal fight that shows some serious ignorance.  Morris thought he would just rush Smith, and he paid for that mistake dearly.  In no time there was a clinch, and it appeared that Morris pulled Smith on top of him.  Smith proceeded to deliver 3 massive crosses, 7 sharp elbows, 8 lethal punches, 3 vicious elbows, and a partridge in a pear tree.  One of the more uneven, ugly fights in UFC history...but not nearly as uneven as the next bout, Johnny Rhodes vs. Fred Ettish.

In the most hilarious fight in MMA history, Fred Ettish decided to test his VERY limited skills in the octagon.  Oops!  Johnny Rhodes, former kickboxing champion, faced off against Fred Ettish, a 5th degree black belt in Kenpo - which he clearly got in a Cracker Jack box - and it only took one hard shot to the chops before Ettish was in the fetal position with a glazed look in his eyes.  From there the embarrassment continued, as Ettish lay on the ground and prepared for inevitable shot that would cave his head in - BAM! Right cross from Rhodes! - and the fight was virtually over.  A pint of blood and a cubic ton of machismo poured out of Ettish, and then Rhodes mercifully ended it with an amateurish choke.

Another fight of note, and probably the biggest reason for weight classes in today's MMA world, is the Remco Pardoel vs Orlando Weit fight.  Pardoel, a massive Dutch guy, against Weit, a ripped but small French guy, was just plain ugly.  After a feeling out period, the two ended up on the ground, with Pardoel catching Weit in a crucifix position.  The elbows that followed were vicious and I'm still surprised Weit made it through without brain damage.

UFC 2: No Way Out is important for MMA history for multiple reasons.  Because of the Smith v. Morris fight's brutality, there are better safety measures.  Gracie's BJJ has led to a MMA overhaul, where BJJ is mandatory for every fighter worth his salt.  As mentioned, the Pardoel v. Weit mismatch probably was used as evidence for weight class advocates.  This is a must have for hardcore MMA fanatics, and if not for missing fights, this would be a five-star addition.",1266537600,,2725,4.656903765690377
8096013,4,B000C65YUS,"UFC 2 was pretty good had some good matches. Royce Gracie is from what I hear is the best  in UFC (at least the early days) and he proves it once again.  Being just a casual fan not a hard core one. (I'm only watching to review it)  I have to admit the early days of UFC were a bit better then I original thought after re-watching the early PPV's.

Any hardcore fan will want to add this to there collection. Remember it was the early days so it may not seem as exciteing as your used to in todays UFC. but you get a chance to see how it all begain.",1249516800,,549,3.875
