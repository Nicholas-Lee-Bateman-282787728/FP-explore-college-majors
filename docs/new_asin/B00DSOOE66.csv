5853672,3,B00DSOOE66,"Parallel-space-time fantasy blending Stephen King-like Maine setting (HAVEN and NEEDFUL THINGS) containing  Walt Disney and other fairy-tale-and-myth-adaptations reversed. Varying between brilliant and over-the-top unbelievable.  Good seems to be losing to evil by season 2 end. Much is made of the consequences of choices, especially cliche magic has its price. Few seem to be making the right ones and  with  a millenium of continuance in some cases, even the right ones have diastrous complications.  Characters almost always make  snap short-term emotional choices even when they KNOW the logical long-range ones that would benefit themselves and their societies, usually with the wrong information fed to them by treacheous forces with effective PR. Thus the good, the bad, and the ugly seem medieval in their lack of wisdom--as did short-lived uneducated disease-ridden folks before modern days in this, the ""real world.""  Reminds me of Washington DC.",1401494400,2,957,5.65034965034965
5853673,5,B00DSOOE66,"I love this show. It is a parallelism between different kinds of families and the traditional fairy tales. Suspense, creativity and everyday life mixed together in a show. Perfect.",1401148800,,180,5.241379310344827
5853674,5,B00DSOOE66,I discovered this series while on Netflix. And then I was hooked. Had to get the series season one and season two. I absolutely love it cannot wait till season three comes out so I can buy it!. This series is right up my alley fairytales with a modern twist love it I am HOOKED!!!!!! I would so recommend this to everyone love it!,1401062400,,330,4.171875
5853675,5,B00DSOOE66,"This one take the characters you may know and puts them in the imaginative Cuisinart, hits high and come out with a crazy good blend of al the stories you love mixed in a big what if scenario. Can you imagine the Thanksgiving dinners at Snow White and Charming's place? Don't eat the apple pie....",1400889600,,297,4.418181818181818

5853677,5,B00DSOOE66,IT WAS GREAT WE REALLY ENJOYED CATCHING UP ON THE EPISODES WE MISSED. wE ARE READY FOR THE NEXT SEASON TO COME OUT ON DISC.,1399939200,,123,3.96
5853678,5,B00DSOOE66,"Bought this set to give to a friend who loves the series but whose job involves traveling extensively, preventing them from keeping current with it.  A greatly appreciated gift!",1399507200,,177,5.103448275862069
5853679,1,B00DSOOE66,"I love ""Once Upon a Time"" but this wasn't the experience I was hoping for.  The  problem was that the first season seems to want to skip on the first five episodes so it wasn't as enjoyable of an experience as I wanted.  I would be watching it and it would just skip a whole section ahead!  Fortunately the second season didn't do it but still it isn't cool that I have to leave my playstation off for at least an hour, watch it, and not rewind or forward any of my favorite scenes.  I won't be coming back to order from this place again!!",1396137600,2,539,4.095238095238095
5853680,5,B00DSOOE66,"The service was wonderful. The show is a must have, I've watched it since it came on TV three years ago.",1395446400,2,104,4.0
5853681,5,B00DSOOE66,"One of the best shows on television!  If you love faery tales, you need to see this show.  If you love adventure, you need to see this show.  Same goes if you are young at heart.",1395187200,4,178,3.888888888888889
5853682,5,B00DSOOE66,"This is a very good series. All the fairy tale characters like Snow  White, Prince Charming and countless others are put under a curse by the evil Queen and sent into our present time and do not know who they are in a town called Storybroke. A boy named Henry finds out about this and finds his mother Emma who gave him up 10 years ago to come with him to Storybroke because she can break the curse. Of course she does not believe. The show has good action and is like Lost with a lot of flashbacks. Action is cool and it even has a lot of magic in it as well. A lot of the fairytale charactors have different roles than what we grew up on and are use to. Captian Hook arrives in the second season. Sometimes it takes people to long to do stuff because they do not believe and then some people with power hold back from taking out certain people because they have feelings. This can drag some of the stories on too long. Overall I enjoyed both seasons.",1393891200,4,952,4.145945945945946
5853683,5,B00DSOOE66,Love this show.  I can not  wait until season 3 is available for purchase. Bought this for my daughter who is anxiously waiting for the new season to be televised.,1393200000,3,163,4.4
5853684,4,B00DSOOE66,"As far as the show itself, the quality of the writing is good and I find the show to be quite addictive! I love the spin they put on all the classic fairy tales I grew up with.

The only complaint I have about this purchase is season one had some difficulties playing. Most of them were minor glitches that were tolerable. Disc 4 won't play at at all! I thought it was my dvd player on my laptop but my sister says it won't play on her dvd player either.",1392163200,3,454,3.989010989010989
5853685,5,B00DSOOE66,"I've always like fairytales, and fairytale retellings, but this series certainly takes that  to a whole new level. Captivating characters, plot twist upon plot twist, it's impossible not to get sucked into the story - and once you've watched it, you're sure to want to go back and watch again to make sure you've missed nothing!",1390608000,2,328,4.857142857142857
