7912202,3,B00000JGK2,"If you want to be able to draw cartoon people - especially cartoon faces - quickly and easily, this is the tape for you. You don't even need to know how to draw; Mr. Blitz has come up with a system that is self-contained and nearly foolproof. I probably drew 40 cartoon faces the same day I watched the tape.
However, the tape makes little effort to connect to other important aspects of cartooning. For example, how to make a face that looks like someone you know; how to compose a picture (what to put where); how to get your message across successfully; etc. In other words, the system is a little too self-contained.
If you want to have fun and impress your friends by being able to draw basic cartoon people quite quickly and easily, definitely buy this tape: it delivers. Just don't think it's going to teach you how to be a comic artist.",995155200,6,844,4.416666666666667
