8218524,2,B00006SFJU,"Ostensibly about the effects of ""la crisis"" (sort of chronic for the last forty years) on the urban middle class in the DF, but in reality not so much. The plot is thin, the acting is ok, and ultimately, I couldn't make it through the whole thing. I could speculate about the ending, but I won't. A kind of made for the movies telenovela.

8218527,2,B00006SFJU,"Well, the only reasons I got this film were I got it for $3.00 and I'm going through a foreign film phase right now.

The plot is about a couple that splits up after several years of marriage and both of them are thrown back to the dating scene.  The whole film is predictable from the very beginning.  There isn't much to keep you interested for long.  The acting is pretty much non existent throughout the whole film.  The only believable character is the shrink that makes cynic, sarcastic and realistic comments in 30 second shots of him talking trying to explain what love is... and the only funny character, at least for me, was the waiter at the end of the film.  Those two are the only characters worth noting.

The movie does try to make an effort at keeping you interested but it fails to do so.  You have to consider that for almost 30 years mexican films pretty much sucked since the mid 60s.  If you're looking for a mexican film that is entertaining, try the post Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas movies out there.  Although I'm not a big fan of that film, I highly recommend it since it brought back to life mexican cinema.  Cilantro y Perejil just won't do it for you.  Trust me!",1256688000,,1185,4.360730593607306

8218529,4,B00006SFJU,"""Cilantro & Perejil"" is a sweet film from Mexico that is a romantic comedy.  Cilantro and parsley refer to herbs that are used in cooking.  The film won Ariel Awards in Mexico for the Best Direction of Rafael Montero and for Best Editing.  Carlos Limon is a businessman who is so obsessed with deals that he spends almost no time with his wife Susana.  Demian Bichir plays Carlos.  Bichir appeared north of the border in ""Heartbreak Hospital"" in 2002 and will star in Steven Soderbergh's film ""The Argentine,"" playing Fidel Castro to Benicio del Toro's Che Guavara.  His bold Latin good looks make him great as the often-confused husband.  Susana is played by Arcelia Ramirez.  Ramirez has appeared in many Mexican films and television shows.  Susana tosses Carlos out because he's not paying attention to her.  Pride apparently drags out the separation for four months until they are reunited with a computer match of a dating service as they sit down to a restaurant dinner.  Susana's grandmother Adela is played by Mercedes Pascual.  She also finds romance with Alejandro Bichir's Genaro.  This is a sweet melodrama that keeps your attention and ties things up at the end with a happy ending.  Enjoy!",1196121600,3,1203,4.891089108910891
8218530,4,B00006SFJU,"CILANTRO AND PARSLEY comes on quietly as one of the characters in the story is making a video about Couples. She happens to interview her sister and then her brother-in-law and we see a mariage fall apart on film.  But just as ""reality"" is what videos of world events are supposed to be feeding us, quite the opposite occurs here.  Through a series of attempts to adjust to the non-married world, seeking to overcome the loneliness that pairing can prevent, all the characters we see eventually find that being ""coupled"" is the only safe haven in a world that no longer makes sense.  Sensitively directed and acted, this movie restores faith in partnerships that sadly seems out of vogue today.  A feel good film.",1041206400,16,713,4.725806451612903
