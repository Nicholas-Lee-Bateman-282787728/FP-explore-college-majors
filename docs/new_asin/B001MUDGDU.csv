8321822,3,B001MUDGDU,"I rec'd the set 4 days after ordering, so I have to give the store kudos for fast response.  However, the quality of the DVD recordings so far is less than spectacular. The cases are so cheap that all 4 DVDs were loose & rattling around inside their cases. Two of the four ended up with blemishes and scratches as a result.

The only one I've watched so far is Rescue from Gilligan's Island. It still appears to play okay, in spite of the shipping defects. However the video quality itself looks like a 10yr old VHS tape that someone decided to record to DVD.  I don't expect much better from the other three DVDs.

In summary, if all you care about is seeing these movies out of curiosity, you may be okay with this set.  If you're a collector looking for high quality copies, you'll probably be disappointed.",1409356800,2,810,4.409395973154362
