8116175,4,B000F0UU8C,"I love the Thirsty Traveler. I watched the shows when they were on TV.(cable) I like the approach of the host, he does not over welm you with to much detail of crap...He hits the mark on many fronts.  He gives you the low-down of each drink and lets you know that they are tasty and here for everyone to enjoy. You just have to go after them to try them...

My only wish. . .that the other seasons would be avaliable to purchase. I have bought season one, I can not find any other season of the Traveler for sale. I watched the entire series and would love to purchase the rest of the episodes. Tell me where and when they will be coming out? I want them.",1326240000,,655,4.069767441860465
8116176,4,B000F0UU8C,"Product is awesome.  Packaged well.

Only complaint was I ordered this for a Christmas present.  I have ""free"" standard 2 day Amazon.  This was not covered under that.  AND I was not able to request any expedited service.  I did order 2 weeks before Christmas.  Received no tracking info.  Date range given of possible receipt was about a month.  It did arrive after Christmas, disappointingly.  I did write to the vendor immediately after ordering requesting expedited services, etc.  No answer was ever received from the vendor except a standard response of ""we received your inquiry and will get back to you with in 24-48 hours"".... and then still no response.  I do alot of online shopping, both personally and for my business, and have been ""spoiled"" by constant order confirmations and tracking info.  Unfortunately this was not the case this time.",1295049600,,854,4.971631205673759
8116177,5,B000F0UU8C,"If you are a fan of the show, then you will be happy to have this in your DVD collection.  If you have never seen the show, you will find it quite funny, entertaining and most importantly...INFORMATIVE.  Great locations and a great host. (The Main Menu screen is nothing fancy but gets the job done.)  I think out of the four seasons the show ran on cable, this is the only one that made it to copy.  Too bad!!!  I hope they reconsider and produce the others.",1206144000,,459,4.2298850574712645
8116178,5,B000F0UU8C,"The Food Network's Kevin Brauch has every guy's dream job - travel to foreign countries just to try their beer. In the first installment of the series, Brauch wings it to Scotland to track down some whisky, travels to Ireland in search of stout, tries a bunch of beer in Belgium, and visits France to try their Champagne. Each visit includes a lesson on the local culture, the traditions associated with the native alcoholic beverage and, best of all, a wine or beer or whisky and food pairing with local cuisine. Highly recommended, the perfect video to enjoy over drinks on a quiet Friday night.",1200873600,5,597,4.695238095238095
8116179,5,B000F0UU8C,"Informative is the word for this show and this DVD.  I love it.  This is one show I look forward to watching on cable, and there are not many. This is about the only show that will make me change from HGTV. Kevin is smooth, likable and easy to watch. He truly enjoys what he is doing and it shows, well who wouldn't.  Traveling the world and tasting each countrys famous drinks. BUT, it is not only drinks, he touches on the culture and the food also.  Just a great show and DVD, bring on the Second and Third Season.  WE ARE WAITING.................",1187740800,4,550,4.300970873786408
8116180,2,B000F0UU8C,"...With his vacuous babble, snarky cockyness, & outright rude demeanor. You should feel like he is having fun and enjoying the people around him. Instead he is boring and seems to dislike many of the people he meets, or they dislike him. It's unfortunate that he has the best job on the planet, since he is so hard to watch.

Just watch how he treats the bartender in Glasgow who has been voted best Martini year after year. He forces the BT to make it shaken, then makes the BT drink it.",1174953600,,488,4.304347826086956
8116181,5,B000F0UU8C,"I enjoyed this DVD set.  If you are interested in travel and drinking and food, then this is great entertainment.  Each episode has information about how the drinks are made and how to make the recipes which are all from local people.  You can repeat most, if not all, of the drinks and food yourself at home.  Great DVDs.  I will definitely purchase the next season when it comes out.",1167177600,5,385,4.442857142857143
8116182,5,B000F0UU8C,"I bought this DVD for my husband who is obsessed with the Thirsty Traveler show. He saves all the shows on our DVR and we can't record anything else. If you are a home brewer or wine maker, you need to watch this show. Kevin is a great host. As a woman, I enjoy watching the show too. I just wish they had the other Seasons on DVD!!! Please come out with them soon!!",1163030400,3,366,3.9594594594594597
8116183,5,B000F0UU8C,"i haven't watched the season on the box. dvd set yet, (because when this was written it was still April 7th, 11 days before it was released) but i have seen and recorded as many episodes as i possibly can. this is the best show i've ever seen. fav episodes were, switzerland with Absinthe, and belgium with belgum white ale. i'm watching the season review. i missed the jamaica trip but can't wait to see it on the season set.",1144368000,,426,4.3375
