8434444,3,B004LK0FVO,"'ADMISSIONS OPEN' looks at an alternate system of education. Nothing wrong with that; after all in India last five years have actually seen some drastic measures being taken when it comes to grading system and subject options. But still, there is some level of discipline, standardisation and seriousness expected to be imbibed into students who are working towards making their future. Why make mockery of everything that has been well established and has it's own benefits? It's one thing to challenge the system and another to totally ignore those aspects that have indeed worked.

Sadly, 'ADMISSIONS OPEN' follows the latter path and eventually turns out to be one of those inconsequential films that come out of nowhere and (rightly) get lost in oblivion. There is no fluidity in narrative, no impression made in acting and no plot development that makes you even reasonably engrossed in the proceedings.

In this film too he aims at being all earnest but is let down by the story line and treatment that just doesn't excite enough. As someone who challenges the current education system, he does begin a revolution of sorts with a Professor (Anupam Kher) but the alternate system which is eventually built is nothing but a sham.",1300665600,,1234,5.014634146341463
