8504792,3,B006UTDFQQ,"The town of Sagawa is being taken over by the Shoryu Yakuza to make room for a Casino as the laws of imminent domain don't seem to apply here for casinos which may or may not be called Trump Towers. Asami, who is a Yakuza killer returns to town and opts to take on the Yakuza and their hired killer Akira.

The film is done as an old  western grindhouse in regard to plot, music, and effects which included a ridiculous deleted scene. The film had all the bells and whistles of a grindhouse, but lacked cohesiveness. Plenty of blood, killing, and torture. Oh yes Asami can also catch bullets.

No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1456790400,,622,4.391304347826087
8504793,2,B006UTDFQQ,"Some very low budget gun play, martial arts, & sword play scenes. In between, there is some very amature level acting.  This film is about gratuitous violence, not sex (or even skin).  The budget is micro and it shows.  The director is into Ennio Morricone scores and Sergio Leone films, and this film pays homage to both.

Some people are going to like this film because blood & violence.  However, if you want trashy Japanese exploitation cinema with blood & violence I recommend these other (much better) films: Azumi, Azumi 2, Tokyo Gore Police, Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl, & Helldriver.

Or if you want something even better than those films, then stick to the 1970s output of Toei Studios.",1435104000,3,703,4.816666666666666

8504796,4,B006UTDFQQ,"Yukuza Hunters Duel in Hell wasn't too bad. The major problem I had was that some of the action scenes were too over the top for me. Being able to stop bullets with your fingers is something I just couldn't get into. But Asami and Hitomi Miwa give good performances, plus they're cute.",1353628800,5,285,4.39622641509434
