6284028,5,B00IOFDJHY,"Love this anime. I was hesitant when I first heard about it, but once I actually started watching, I couldn't stop. Funny character interactions, and oddly touching at the same time. Well worth viewing for any anime fan.",1417219200,2,220,4.815789473684211
6284029,5,B00IOFDJHY,anime's are my greatest pastime but i have to pay off my bills by next May they are wonderful,1405296000,4,93,3.9473684210526314
6284030,5,B00IOFDJHY,"I first looked at this show based solely off the name.  First, a common disclaimer to those who share a like mind with me:  There is NO true nudity in this Anime.  By this I mean, there are no nipples are genitals shown.  There are lots of implied nudity not shown, and obscured shots, jiggle moments, awkward contacts,  etc. but nothing overly risqu.

After finishing watching this, it became my instant favorite.  The main character, Yokodera, is the usual oblivious male, but that is validated to some extent by the end of the series.  The Main Female lead, Tsukiko, is adorable to the point of ridiculousness, and while emotionless, never the less manages to make her feelings known.  The Second female lead, Azuki, is a classic Tsudere but is entertaining and fun the whole time.  And the final Female in the Trifecta harem is the scary, but amazingly dense and curvy one, and would be my favorite, if it were not for how endearing Tsukiko's mannerisms make her.  (When you see the ""Doskoi"" scene, you will understand what I mean.)

Also, this has a great supporting cast, from Azuki's ""friends"" to Ponta and the Vice-Captain of the track team.  But the clear winner is ""Barbara-san"" who I am not going to spoil, but made the show that much greater for her part in it.

The story can be a bit confusing the first time through, but while nothing truly special, it is good for a number of laughs fairly consistently throughout the series, and even in the tear jerker of the finale, still manages to give a few chuckles.  And on that note, one of the things that so strongly made me love this title, was the Ending.  I watch a lot of Harem Anime, and I am almost uniformly irritated by a lack of a finite ending.  While this one still leaves it open to more episodes eventually, it at the same time manages to end the story with a somewhat clear victor.  And while it does leave it somewhat open as to which of the girls is the ultimate winner, it gives a ending scene that perfectly closes the series at the same time, and was absolutely delightful.

In terms of the Voice work, while I normally love having an English dub, in this case, if it does come with one, I would not watch it with it, and would suggest you do not either.  The Japanese voices in this Anime, I feel, just cannot be replicated satisfactorily by English speakers, and it would lose some of the charm that makes it so great in being dubbed.

So, overall, if you want a cute, fun, and funny anime that plays loose with sexual humor without ever going to far overboard (Think B Gata H Kei levels) that has engaging characters, a cute romantic element, some of the most infuriatingly catchy intro and ending themes, and a solid ending that closes out the story but leaves you ready for more, this is a must for your collection.

After having watched this copy, I must commend the Subbing, as just the placement of a word or two in certain spots, made the complete plot make so much more sense the first time around.  The subbing is superb.  Also, just a gripe, because the Cover Art, while a nice picture, has NOTHING to do with anything in the show, and gives a complete wrong indication about what is contained within.",1396828800,42,3210,4.487091222030981
6284031,4,B00IOFDJHY,This show I found to be very hilarious and had lovable characters. I would have preferred if Sentai had decided to do an english dub for it too however. When I buy shows I prefer to have both sub and dub available so I guess I'll wait to see if that comes at a later time. Don't be thrown off by the title. Hentai prince simply means pervert so don't expect anything other than that.,1393977600,13,383,4.12

8644008,4,B00IOFDJHY,"Overall this is a pretty good anime which is why I purchased it. I gave it a 4 star rating only because I felt it could have been better. I've seen many ""pervert"" style animes over the years and they just didn't write the main character as well as they could have, especially given the title of this anime. Still, it is a decent story overall.",1503964800,,343,4.212121212121212
8644009,5,B00IOFDJHY,Typical Comedy of a male character having to make his choices over which girl in the series he's going to love. Throw in a few twists unique to the plot and you get a rather nice laugh. For the price I paid it was well worth it.,1466294400,,228,3.872340425531915
8644010,5,B00IOFDJHY,"Incredibly cute characters, and a great plot. The plot tapers off a bit towards the end, but it still has a satisfying finish. The special features are a little lackluster, but for what it is, this is a great anime. It's extremely funny, and I laughed pretty hard at some parts. It does a good job of taking anime cliches and putting a twist on them in a funny way. Which isn't to say it's all cliche. I found the way it handled characters and plot in general pretty original for an anime of this subject matter.

Japanese voice, English subs, no English dub.",1465344000,,559,4.375

8644012,4,B00IOFDJHY,Both story and artwork was good. The story was ok but little on the simple.,1456531200,,75,4.066666666666666
8644013,4,B00IOFDJHY,"Ever wish upon a cat? That might make you crazy, or it might make you Yokodera, a young pervert-at-heart who wants to speak his mind more boldly, or Tsukiko, a girl who wants to stop wearing her heart on her sleeve. A stone cat idol grants their wishes to a greater degree than they wanted, and the result (along with subsequent wishes) forms the core of this animes plot.

The main thing a prospective buyer needs to understand about The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat is that its fun, but can be incredibly uneven. When this show is good, its fantastic, and its at its best when the focus is on Tsukiko and her sister Tsukushi, the Steel King track captain. The emotionless Tsukiko is easily the best part of the show. Besides being adorable, this emotionless girl is also fascinating and thought-provoking to watch, because she *does* show emotion, but never vocally or in her expressions. When shes mad, she kicks the crap out of chairs with a perfect deadpan expression, and when shes embarrassed or excited, she plays with her hair or starts talking quickly in perfect monotone. Showcasing her personality took some real thought on the animators and writers parts, and their effort shows. As for Steel King, Tsukushi is hilarious and migraine-inducing stupid, but at the same time noble in a way that makes you eventually respect her character.

Other pluses are that the romantic elements of this show are handled sincerely and endearingly. You will like these characters and hope things work out well for them as a couple. Its also beautifully animated, most of the humor is top-notch, and some of the consequences of the characters wishes are surprisingly complex and well-thought-out.

On the flipside, when the show is bad, it can be awful. My number one gripe is that this series is extremely inconsistent in its tone. The first few episodes are a mildly raunchy, madcap comedy, but thereafter it alternates between tearjerker episodes and funny ones with little rhyme or reason. If you watched only the first two episodes and then the last two, Hentai Princes multiple personality disorder becomes glaring. Its most obvious in the character of Yokodera, the male lead. In the first few episodes, hes a genuine pervert, and a dedicated, shameless one at that. (He reminded me a lot of Ataru Moroboshi from Urusei Yatsura.) By the midpoint of the series, though, he mellows out to the point where he doesn't have nearly as many interesting personality features. The rest of the cast is more consistent, but not particularly entertaining  Azuki (the female rival character) is a textbook clich tsundere, and no other supporting cast member caught my attention other than Tsukikos feisty mother (who only appears briefly).

Another downside is that this is a lazy release by almost any measure. The translation/localization job on this anime is poor, in my opinion. The word hentai was left untranslated throughout the show for no apparent reason, even though pervert prince alliterates so nicely in English, and the dialogue sometimes feels weird and stilted. A good translation should be faithful to the originals meaning, but it also needs to sound natural in the translated language too often, Hentai Prince misses the mark on that. In addition, there is no English-language dub track, and the special features are basically zilch. Finally, the opening credits to this PG-13ish series feels oddly sleazy, which makes me feel a little embarrassed to recommend this show to friends.

Despite the negatives, I watched Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat all the way through to the end, and doing so never felt like a chore. In fact, I looked forward to it quite a lot  the better characters and good humor drove the show and helped me look past the bad elements. Just go into it with moderate expectations and ready to take the bad with the good, and I think youll enjoy it.

EDIT/UPDATE: It's now a few months since I originally wrote this review, and to my surprise, I found myself returning to ""Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat"" to rewatch different episodes on multiple occasions. In light of the second watch, I'm going to bump my original review up a star (from 3 to 4), for two reasons. First, any anime that draws you back in for another watch all on its own within just a few weeks has something special going on, and that deserves to be recognized. Second, this show makes *so* much more sense and plays so much better if you know the ending from the start. In my initial watch, I got frustrated because it kept defying and warping expectations in what seemed like a completely unpredictable (i.e. totally random) way. I still stand by some of that criticism, but I now see more consistency in the characters than I did initially. ""Hentai Prince"" really is a good show; you just have to keep your expectations fluid while watching it and constantly apply new information to what you've already seen. There's a lot more mystery in this comedy than it lets on.",1440720000,3,4974,4.81615925058548
