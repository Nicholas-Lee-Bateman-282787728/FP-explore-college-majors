Price and production values are not what Shape's about. There are heroes and terrible villians, high lords and lowlifes, horseguard and rifemen, buffoons and ballads. It's about the stories! Wonderful stories you'll enjoy seeing again and again. Follow Sharp's climb through the ranks, through dangerous, impossible missions, and you'll end up caring about every ragtag rifleman in his company, even Isaih Tongue. And every time you hear these lyrics, you'll be so glad you bought it:
Ore the Fields, and Ore the Maine
Thru Flanders Portugal, and Spain,
King George commands, and we obey.
Over the hills and far away",1086134400,14,808,4.992592592592593
1707265,3,B000065KTL,"I am a big fan of the entire Napoleonic historical fiction genre, and of the Sharpe's book series in particular.  (I actually saw the entire film series before I cracked one of the books.)
These movies are LOW budget TV efforts, but they do allow you to put a face, or a uniform, or a tactic in a new perspective, and to understand a little more about history.  Sean Bean is a perfect choice for Sharpe.  He manages to convey just the right mix of jaded, seen-it-all expert, with the fish out of water bumpkin, and then layers on a ""screw-you-guys,-I'll-do-it-anyway"" vibe to top it all off.
The movies deviate significantly and unnecessarily on many of the major plot points.  Sharpe's Gold in particular is a dissappointment, doing away with the books plot entirely and substituting something that plays like a bad, back-fitted Star Trek episode.
However, my big complaint is with the pricing point for the series.  There are 14 installments (the 15th DVD is apparently a montage-type review of the whole series) of about 9-100 minutes each of low-budget, TV-quality viewing, or only about 23 hours. Plus these movies are already pretty old.  I don't think you can name another similar vintage TV offering that is asking for this kind of cash/hour.  (Heck, the Monty Python set has older material, twice as much stuff, almost the same number of DVD's and all for only about 60% of the price).
The set fails to even be a bargain compared to buying disks individually.  This is a drawback for people who have already purchased just one or two of the movies individually (and most of the fans of the series already have).  I don't think I'd be out of line to suggest that this set shouldn't be more than 150-175$US.
I'll put a plug here in opposition to creative packaging.  If I can't fit it on my DVD shelves, it gets thrown away.  Spare the stupid crate, and save us all $10.00 and some wasted effort.
Still, these movies manage to be worth watching if you are in any way interested or even curious in the era, and I do recommend watching them, but I can't honestly say that they're worth this price.",1076284800,18,2102,4.60857908847185
1707266,5,B000065KTL,"Ok, so some of you guys who read the books first, were disapointed with this miniseries. GET OVER IT!
As a person who was introduced to Sharpe via these movies, I have to say they are absolutely FANTASTIC! Sean Bean IS Sharpe! They are a great way to get to know the period, the characters, and the history. The cast is fantastic, the costumes are authentic, and yes the production is low budget, but so what. That ""BBC Charm"" is part of the over all effect, and adds to that dirty, desperate, rag-tag feel that was authentic of the British army at that time. A big buget ""Lord of the Rings"" production isn't always the way to go, and would have harmed more then helped in this case. Film brings many pluses, that books can't. For example, the many songs and accents which only a cast of top british, irish, french, spanish, etc can provide.
These movies have produced a fantatical Sharpe fan in me, and if they can do that, then they are definately worthy of the Sharpe name.

1707267,5,B000065KTL,"I actually AM a fan of the British writer Bernard Cornwell's masterful Sharpe book series (note: that's Sharpe with an E - how could an alleged fan of the books misspell the hero's name???) and I think Sean Bean is excellent as Richard Sharpe, the clever, daring soldier who, against all odds, always ""lives to march again"" during the Napoleonic Wars. Sean Bean truly brings the British character to life.
If I had $300 I would buy this special edition box/crate set immediately, because this really is a classic series. Poirot's Hugh Laurie plays a dignified and fairly amusing Wellington, but the Riflemen, Sharpe's soldiers, are the real comic relief. And listen for the electric guitar riffs in the opening theme - it's hilariously anachronistic.",1068595200,3,750,5.008
1707268,5,B000065KTL,"I have this fantastic set of movies depicting the steady rise of Richard Sharpe from the ranks of the English Army of the early 1800s. Sean Bean plays the role of Richard Sharpe who, as we are first introduced to him, is a sergeant in the British Army in Portugal during the campaign to drive Napoleon's Army out of Spain. He begins his rise from the ranks after saving the Lord Wellington from three French Dragoons single handedly. He then is assigned to the 95th Rifles Regiment as an officer and the adventures begin.
  Some of the earlier films are rough looking production wise but still make for great viewing. I love how the troops are shown to be a rough motley looking bunch as the armies of the period truely looked while on campaign. The stories have plenty of action, adventure, romance, and drama. It is definately a worthwhile purchase.",1047859200,63,851,4.629139072847682
1707269,5,B000065KTL,"There is something special about this series of made for TV movies.  Despite the low budget, which forced the producers to move away from move accurately mirroring the original books, the movies are a class act with near perfect characterizations.  Sean Bean certainly plays Richard Sharpe to a tee, as does Daragh O'Malley with Sergeant Patrick Harper.  I sat down and watched each film at least twice and I'll no doubt watch them again.  Even my wife, never a fan of anything remotely to do with this genre, enjoyed them immensely.  I rarely buy movies of any kind, especially when they cost a small fortune buying them in a bundled package, but these were worth every penny.
Spielberg or Lucus take note: this would be a fabulous series to take to the big screen with modern digital special effects.  This time period, with Lord Wellington and the Napoleonic wars in particular, is a large missing link in historical moving making.",1044576000,5,934,4.80625

7961163,4,B000065KTL,"Though each episode as titled on the DVD does not ""match"" the content of the novel with the same title, it really does not matter. All the relevant events necessary to make Sharpe's story real come to life on the DVD's. We have already enjoyed watching them twice! I do wish, however, that the map included with the set were of Spain and Portugal so we could have followed Sharpe's adventures (it is of Europe with only a sliver of eastern Spain)! And who can't watch hours of Sean Bean!!??",1347840000,,490,4.455555555555556
7961164,5,B000065KTL,"I decided to buy the Blu-Ray version after reading about the poor video quality on the DVDs.  The early episodes didn't have the best picture quality, but that didn't really interfere with our viewing enjoyment.  Also, gotta love the eighties-esque electric guitar in the opening theme.  My only complaint is that the last two movies, ""Sharpe's Peril"" and ""Sharpe's Challenge"", came out after this set was compiled.  But I bought those separately and they still fit in the wooden box. MORE SHARPE PLEASE!  Now to read the books...",1317513600,4,530,4.9772727272727275
7961165,5,B000065KTL,"I love the series both as the books and the films.  Of course, this being BBC, you can tell that they were budget constrained when a regiment now consists of 6 or 7 men.  Some of the video transfer quality to Blu-Ray is less than stellar as well.  But overall, an enjoyable product and the placement in a mini-ammo crate is a lot of fun and I even use the letter opener.  Lots of fun and well worth the money.",1307491200,3,409,4.075

And there is an obviouse money move after Sean Bean became famouse.  but its still great seires we won't see again because A&E turned to the dark side.  Remeber Horatio hornblower and movies like that?  now its MTV like crap.  What a waste and they wonder why their going out of business",1282867200,2,370,4.304347826086956
7961167,5,B000065KTL,"We rented two ""Sharpe's"" from Netflix and then bought the series. Sharpe is a complex character well done by Sean Bean. Actually we found all the characters from Patrick to Harris to be convincing and Jane so good we hated her. I read most of the books after seeing the film and while it may not be line-by-line true to the book or to history for that matter, it was good entertainment.  That's all we ask from fiction.",1115251200,5,419,4.371794871794871

7961169,4,B000065KTL,"For those of you with region-free DVD players (and to the rest of you what in the world are you waiting for) the complete Sharpe series is available on DVD at amazon's UK site for under $100.

Really, that's a saving of almost $200 and the Region 2 DVDs of course are in the technically superior PAL format. So pick up a region free DVD player and the complete Sharpe series on Region 2 DVD and you'll still be spending less than on this one USA set. Plus, the Sharpe DVDs are readily available to ship in less than 24 hours from Amazon UK.

These series of movies are amazing. I started watching them on ITV in the UK (correction to previous review: this was NOT a BBC production) and then on A&E here in the US. The production values are great, the stories/plots exciting and the acting compelling.

UPDATE: The price on Amazon UK has been increased. The new price (2/21/05) is $129. Still a great deal cheaper than for the US Region 1 release..",1103414400,40,947,4.369318181818182
