7956725,4,B00005Y7Z8,"The great irony of the final episode of the original ""Star Trek"" series is that for the first time someone other than William Shanter gets to play Captain Kirk.  Shanter's clipped manner of speaking as Kirk is such that anyone and everyone from Jim Belushi to anyone who has ever seen an episode of ""Star Trek"" can imitate him.  The last two years Shatner has won Emmy awards for playing Denny Crane on ""Boston Legal"" (talking nothing like Captain Kirk, I should point out), which tends to suggest the guy can act.  But then anyone who watched the two episodes that Shatner did for ""The Twilight Zone"" (""Nick of Time"" and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet""), knew the guy could act.  So it is not all that surprising that he turns in one of his best ""Star Trek"" performances in this episode:

Episode 79, ""Turnabout Intruder"" (Teleplay by Arthur H. Singer, Story by Gene Roddenberry, First aired June 3, 1969), finds the ""Enterprise"" on its way to Beta Aurigae, when it receives a distress call from Camus II.  There the landing party finds Dr. Janice Lester (Sandra Smith) and Dr. Arthur Coleman (Harry Landers).  Coleman claims that everyone else on the planet has been killed by celebium radiation and that Lester is dying from it.  But when Lester and Kirk are alone, she suddenly springs up and activates an alien machine, which transfers the essence of each person into the others' body.  Lester and Kirk had been romantically involved once upon a time, but she now hates him because she wanted to captain a starship and could not cut it, while Kirk is now everybody's fair-haired boy.  Now Lester finaly has the captain's chair of the ""Enterprise.""

However, from the first the crew is rather suspicious. Shatner has played Kirk possessed by alien intelligence before, not to mention with his personality split in half, but this time around he gets to play Kirk possessed by an angry woman. It is one of Shatner's finer moments as an actor on the series, but Sandra Smith's performance as Lester, and as Lester with Kirk's essence, is equally as solid.  These performances are what elevates this episode above the gaping holes in the script. ""Lester"" proves she is unfit to command as she quickly jumps off the deep end as ""her"" behavior becomes more and more bizarre. I also like the fact that the crew is quick on the uptake when the captain starts acting a bit strange. In a lot of episodes like this it takes forever for them to catch on, but that is not the case here. I do not think ""Turnabout Intruder"" is a great episode and since the series was hoping, in vain, to be renewed for a fourth season, the fact it was last is an undue burden. But I also think it is clearly an above average episode (Warp 4.5).",1145059200,,2713,4.594202898550725
