But I don't know that as many people know about these hiking videos and heres the thing: if you do treadmills or ellipticals- these are your ticket to fun!  I don't know why anyone would even get near a walking machine without setting up some kind of entertainment first and these particular videos are the best ones out there.  They last longer, have a nice consistent pace and have the best places.
What makes this one five-star for me is the wide variety of truly beautiful places in the bay area captured here.  Thinking back on it as I write, I cant even believe how many cute, stunning and unique places they collected onto one disc!  What a great investment in your health and well-being!!!
I've gotten several of these hiking videos and I like them all.",1439078400,,870,4.509554140127388
