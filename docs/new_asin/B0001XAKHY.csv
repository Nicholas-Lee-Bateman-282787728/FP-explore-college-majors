8017548,4,B0001XAKHY,"""Snake in the Monkey's Shadow"" is one of THE BEST martial art's movies from the 70's  It's right up there with all of the best Shaw Brothers classics from that same era (""Five Deadly Venoms"", etc.)  Fight scenes are great, acting is very convincing, and the usual ridiculous humor and stock music tracks that we all love.  From the very cool opening credit scene and score, followed by a fight between two individuals with dueling styles, the movie pulls the viewer into the story right away.

I would have given this DVD the maximum rating, except that the picture quality is only fair.  This was probably transferred from an old grindhouse 35mm print.  But, please note:  This is the ONLY DVD version that is UNCUT (containing the scenes where the actual monkey and snakes fight), and, most importantly, its LETTERBOXED, so you get to see the whole picture image.  This movie is impossible to find in letterbox format for some strange reason.  Every VHS copy I have ever seen has been the flat square pan-and-scan, and this movie should definitely be watched in widescreen.

Its amazing to me that, here in 2017, there is still no re-mastered uncut widescreen version of this classic.  But this DVD will certainly do until there is a proper release.

Recommended.

PS-  I haven't watched Horror Holiday yet (although I've watched this ""Snake..."" DVD a dozen times.  Others have give it a decent review though.",1501286400,,1411,4.820833333333334

8017551,5,B0001XAKHY,"When I was about 10 or 11 my uncle's friend Eric brought this movie over and left it at our house for about a month.  At that time Kung-Fu flicks were me and my brother's middle name.  We watched it over and over again and never got bored.  After around the third time we were imitating what moves we could attempt to do on each other.  It was so much fun and now I realize it is what helped in our bonding.  Over the last 4 years I've been trying to retrieve as many movies from my childhood that I adored as possible.  And, yes, ""Snake In The Monkey's Shadow"" is indeed one of them.  I'm so glad I found it.",1380067200,,609,3.9834710743801653

8017553,5,B0001XAKHY,"Im here to do a review for the movie horror holiday as pretty much everyone else has already done the other movie featured (which is still a REALLY great movie)

I happened to actually enjoy horror holiday quite a bit. Reason being is that for an ACTION movie it really goes all out. Now, note i said ACTION and not MARTIAL ARTS. The martial arts in this movie takes a back seat to the kind of stuff people who like action movies look for. Namely chase scenes, explosions, and the like. In that regard, this movie has it all!

It has not one, but TWO chase scenes, (one of which involves scooters!) A giant car explosion, People climbing around the outside of a hotel, and...get this. Near the end of the movie it breaks into a song. Not like someone in the movie singing, but rather one of those ""musical numbers"" you tend to see in movies all the time now. And it's translated to boot!

Finishing the movie is an awesome beach fight featuring the main character of the movie fighting against this guy who uses a claw attached to a whip as a weapon.

Well worth finding, as most likely you'll find it cheap. Buy it for Snake in the monkeys shadow, but also for this!",1257552000,,1167,4.339449541284404
8017554,4,B0001XAKHY,SNAKE IN MONKEYS SHADOW IS DEFINANTLY A MUST HAVE. CHOREOGRAPHY AND THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE MONKEY AND SNAKE STYLES ARE NOTHING LESS THEN GREAT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE QUALITY SUCKS ON THIS DVD. ITS BAD BUT ITS NOT THAT BAD. IT WAS STILL WATCHABLE. IVE HAVE SEEN ALOT WORSE. I DIDNT BOTHER WATCHING HORROR HOLIDAY. ILL WATCH IT ONE DAY...,1230508800,,339,4.762711864406779
8017555,2,B0001XAKHY,"Great Movie
Horrible copy.
This was not remastered. I have this as a 20 year old video tape.
My old tape is better than this dvd copy.",1227398400,,134,4.0
8017556,1,B0001XAKHY,"This is a great Kung Fu movie that I have owned for years on VHS.  When it came out on DVD, I was quick to pick up a copy.  I definitely should have waited.  The reproduction of this movie is almost unwatchable.  Red shadows litter the movie and blur many details in the movie.  As a matter of fact this DVD looks like it was copied from a poor VHS using crappy duplication equipment.  The  infamous rising line that comes from poor VHS duplication is present in this edition.  Bottom Line-Movie = 5 stars and quality of reproduction = unwatchable.",1134518400,,548,4.41
