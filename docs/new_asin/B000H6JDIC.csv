8136955,5,B000H6JDIC,"GnR Gold is an awesome video collection with more songs than Welcome to the Videos, but my only complaint i, that it doesn't have the original T2 version of You Could Be Mine.  If you don't have Welcome to the Videos, you should get this one.",1222560000,3,242,4.260869565217392
