8470714,5,B005FV7KO8,If you have a toddler like mine who absolutely LOVES Elmo...he/she will love this DVD. I enjoyed it as well...the ONLY downfall is that the picture quality in some parts is like an old VHS but it was still clear enough to enjoy. My little girl is not yet 2 but this kept her attention from beginning to end!,1347235200,,307,4.220338983050848
