2137166,5,B0002XNSZE,"It's finally here, the crown jewel of the TRIFECTA of gambling movies (Tricheurs, and The Gambler - James Caan not Kenny Rogers, being the other two, IMHO) in all it's widescreen glory!  Like the other reviewers I've had to settle for the Cinemax(?) pan and scan version for years, and a commercial tv version before that.  This film is a lost masterpiece on male bonding, and degenerate gambling, and to be quite honest...I want to be these guys!  My folks took me to see this as a teenager, and it's always been etched on my brain, and now I can finally see it as Altman meant it to be seen.  I agree with Ebert that it's better than MASH, if only because I could watch this film every day!  It's almost like watching a documentary, and the director, writer and cast commentary add credence to what is obvious while watching the film...that a good time was had by all in it's making!  How come no featurette, or even trailer for CS, though?  There are trailers included, but for other Columbia films....I want to see anything related to this film and it's making....Actually, I'm just glad to have it looking this pristine...I would like to know the story, though, about why it's taken so long to come to home video...No VHS, or Laserdisc...Is there a tale?  Has it been finally released because of the new interest in Poker?  At any rate this film should be considered essential to any film enthusiasts collection...definately one of the best films of the 70's!",1099526400,6,1464,4.621621621621622
2137167,5,B0002XNSZE,"Okay, so it should have been a 30th anniversary celebration edition, with all the extras that implies. But at least it can now be seen in its proper format. It's a great movie and certainly the best ever made about gambling. What we internet scribblers should now be doing is campaigning for the DVD release of ""Thieves Like Us"".",1098662400,5,329,4.593220338983051
2137168,5,B0002XNSZE,"Though this movie deserves better treatment and more fanfare, the important thing is that it's coming out; it was never even released on cassette, to my knowledge. I got my bootlegged copy on ebay. Everyone talks about Three Women being Robert Altman's forgotten's masterpiece, but this tops my list. The greatest movie about gambling ever made, and certainly one of the great buddy films of all time. Thanks to Roger Ebert's new site, you can read his 1974 review of the fim, where he said it was superior to MASH. Hopefully this release will bring it all the attention it deserves.",1095465600,,583,4.782178217821782
2137169,5,B0002XNSZE,"OK, so it's coming out as what appears to be a bare-bones disk instead of a juiced-up Criterion collection title (doubly sad since other Altman classics like ""Secret Honor,"" ""Tanner 88"" and ""Short Cuts"" are getting the CC treatment the same month) but that doesn't matter.

What does matter is that I'm finally going to get to see my favorite film in widescreen.

I taped ""Split"" off cable years and years ago.  I remember setting up the recording at some ungodly hour (3:25 a.m. or something) because I didn't want to miss it and I ended up watching the movie in its entirity.

Elliott Gould gives an amazing, lived-in performance as a lucky card player who takes a liking to a less fortunate gambler and, through a series of episodes, we watch them pass a few weeks hitting the track, going to boxing matches, playing poker, drinking, getting beat up and using a neat home remedy on their bruises over Fruit Loops.  Their friendship is one of the best I've seen on-screen.  Screenwriter Joseph Walsh appears briefly as Sparkie the shylock and it's a perfect cameo, a pre-""Sopranos"" portrait of a crook haggard by the life (""Didn't I tell you that I've got busts happening all over the city, that my parents are in town, and you come in here and you don't have dollar one?"")

This is a woefully underseen Altman classic, mostly because it's not available on tape or DVD, it's pretty rare.  But it's a great movie -- I even have the one-sheet for ""Split"" hanging over my computer -- and I'm very, very pleased that I'll finally be able to see something *besides* the opening and closing credits in letterbox (it always seemed to underline the cruelty of pan-and-scan when, after the credit ""Directed by Robert Altman"" my beloved black bars disappeared).",1093564800,44,1753,4.705882352941177

2137199,1,B0002XNSZE,"Uninterruptedly stupid, punctuated by inappropriate music.

2137201,5,B0002XNSZE,"This is a gem of a movie.  You have to respect Altman's movie making to really love it but it's a fun 70's look at gambling and it's grasp on folks.  This is a seedy side of America that most people don't see without the typical hollywood dramatical elements of drugs, guns, and criminals.  You could call Segal and Gould low-lifes but this story is just a wild ride that shows the how people get sucked into gambling.  Segal and Gould are great together and this movie is certainly worth watching (or streaming...as it's hard to find).  This is one of my favorite movie's as i'm a fan of low stakes gambling and Altman.  I really want to see this re-issued by Criterion Collection as it easily fits into what they do and they have celebrated some Altman previously.",1308960000,6,766,4.474820143884892

2137204,5,B0002XNSZE,"Terribly overlooked, and now long out of print, this is a special film, well worth seeing.  Yes the DVD had a couple of trims forced on it over music rights, but it was still a way to at least get to see a minor American classic.  It's a tremendously sad comedy about two very different compulsive gamblers, who form a compulsive friendship almost homo-erotic in quality and intensity.  Some of the very best work of both Gould and Segal's careers.  Not a lot happens, but I was left very moved and a bit shaken by the ending, even if there are a couple of overly cute, or self-referential moments along the way.  One of the more interesting examinations of the American concept of winning and losing I've ever seen.",1281830400,5,716,4.51937984496124
2137215,4,B0002XNSZE,"The main thing that struck me while watching this film is how (like many 70s films) it would never be made today. Today it would be re-written with vulgar potty jokes and immature geek humor a la ""The Hangover"", ""bromance"" (god, I hate that word)-style homo-erotic humor and chick-flick melodrama, and would be chock full of hip music montages, unrealistically sexy women, and would have a flase happy ending. It reminded me of how seldom REAL men are portrayed on the screen. They're usually reduced to testosterone-packed meat puppets, frat-boy washouts, or geeky Peter Pans. Today the characters would be 5-10 years younger, much more attractive, and thoroughly unbelievable.

Instead, we get Robert Altman long before he and his fans became pretentious, Elliot Gould and George Segal (two GREAT 70s actors) at the top of their game, a story that NEVER condescends, and some wonderful widescreen cinematography.

It's not a classic, but it's not trying to be. It's just a funny, smart, touching portrait of a couple of down on their luck, but not quite broken, gamblers. Gets an extra star for having balls. SO refreshing.",1264377600,10,1125,5.043010752688172
2137216,5,B0002XNSZE,"A somewhat loopy exploration of the the motivation  of gamblers by Robert Altman. The techniques that he employed in MASH-strong ensemble cast, overlapping conversations- all used to convey a sense of immediacy and to imitate the unpredictability of life. Elliot Gould as the loosey-goosey, come-what-may guy who lives to gamble, and George Segal as the magazine editor, who, we suspect, has gambled his life into a corner, and now seeks to gamble his way out. Strong supporting cast of Altman regulars Bert Remsen, Gwen Welles, Ann Prentice (looks a lot like Paula) and real-life high rollers like Amarillo Slim. Not to be missed.",1259712000,,631,5.12621359223301
2137217,4,B0002XNSZE,"Okay, to keep things straight Dashiell Hammet's Maltese Falcon was Part I, John Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre was Part II, and here with Robert Altman's California Split we have Part III of the age old dream of humankind to get rich without having to work, or do much of it. Or is there something else that also holds life (and these films together)?  The business at hand in each case is the quest- for the damn bird in Maltese, the damn pot of gold in Treasure or the damn gambling jackpot for our two friends here. The end of this film, fittingly in its own way, tells it all.

After finishing up on a winning streak to end all winning streaks our duo when it is time to divvy up the cash finds there is no closure. That is the message; still it is nice to think of getting the payoff without having to work for it. After all, humankind has spend many millennia organizing itself and creating labor -saving devices for just such a condition. Except someone forgot to tell the few greed heads that this social product should be for the benefit of every one.

The early to mid 1970's was the heyday of the male `buddy' film out of Hollywood. The films of Robert Redford done with Paul Newman like The Sting and Butch Cassidy come to mind. Here Elliot Gould (as Charley) and George Segal (as Bill) two compulsive gamblers who will bet on anything at any time make a run for the roses in Reno. Along the way they get beat up, taken, and every other imaginable scenario before they get their stake for the run. Today such a scenario would include some time in a twelve step program but that is neither here nor there.

These two certainly have some chemistry working off each other's roles. Segal is the moody, enigmatic one; Gould is the classic hustler of the literary imagination. He would find congenial company in a Damon Runyon story. I might add that the so-called romance of gambling for a livelihood certainly gets a workout here. My experience at race tracks and betting parlors has not included these wholesome types. Usually, one is either desperately waiting to get the next bet down or the next stake. Not pretty in either case. But enough, see this movie.",1204848000,2,2176,4.487373737373737
2137218,4,B0002XNSZE,"I will admit I am an Altman fan and a recovering compulisve gambler,so I feel capable of disccusing the theme of this film. It shows Gould and Segal's lives runing from bet to bet and paying the price along the way. It is not a sympathetic look at the world of gambling and has the usual Altman reperatory cast members and style to it. The ending isn't typical of gamblers real life stories, but this is Hollywood and it may have been the ending that the studio wanted. Both actors make their characters real to the viewer and it has a fun feel to it, even though it is not a comedy. It didn't reach a large audience, I feel because it didn't glamorize a topic that has so many ruined lives which makes it that much better. If you can find it, watch it, it is well done and gives you pause when you hear someone say, What goes on in Vegas etc.",1178409600,3,843,4.146341463414634
2137219,5,B0002XNSZE,"Segal and Gould are a decidedly odd pairing in this 1970s movie about gamblers and gambling set in Los Angeles and Reno. Mostly amiable and larky with brief outbursts of violence (a fist fight, an armed robbery), the film takes a sobering turn when we realize that one of the two men is in seriously deep debt to a loan shark. Quirky and off-kilter, the film includes two call-girls, whose clients include a cross dresser.

Compulsive gambling (the kind that sends people to Gamblers Anonymous) permeates the film, which takes us to poker palaces, backroom card games, horse races, boxing matches and the neighborhood basketball court. Eventually, our characters wind up at a Nevada casino. While the conventional gambling story at the time followed the moral guidelines of an earlier Hollywood era, i.e., a downward spiral of loss and failure, this film has other things on its mind, and the ending that it works toward is unexpected.

Altman was experimenting with overlapping dialogue and multiple microphones on set with this film, and the complexity of the soundtrack is a treat for the ears. As in everyday life, we overhear snatches of other people's conversations on the sidelines. Meanwhile, a lounge singer we hear accompanying scenes early in the film appears later on, in person, when the two gamblers arrive at the casino in Reno.

Altman, Segal, Gould and writer Joseph Walsh gather to provide the film's commentary for the DVD edition of this film. Their memories aren't so reliable after 30 years, but we learn how the film was shot in sequence with a degree of improvisation (the drunken attempt to remember the names of the seven dwarves), which allowed for elaboration of the original script and greater character development. We also learn that the apparently improvisational one-handed piccolo player scene was actually scripted, as well as about Gould's reluctance to play it. Still terrific after these many years, the film remains a pleasure to watch again and again.",1163980800,3,1991,5.045592705167174
2137220,1,B0002XNSZE,"If you want to spend 105 minutes with several lowlifes, this movie is for you. No one has any class; a thoroughly seedy atmosphere. You can feel degraded merely by watching it. A big flaw is the lack of motivation for the change in attitude, at the end of the movie, of the George Segal character. At least Gould is as obnoxious as ever. Only lowlifes say they didn't find my review helpful!! Looks like there's lots of lowlifes around. Except two!",1158624000,3,448,4.475609756097561
2137221,4,B0002XNSZE,"I have really liked this movie for years, but this version is missing some scenes, and I mourn the loss. As I recall from seeing the longer version many years ago, we are missing: more Segal/Goldblum interaction at the magazine office, more gambling scenes during the winning streak (certainly some of the blackjack scenes are gone), and most importantly for me, the great repartee between Gould and the piano lady when Gould has no money to gamble but isn't allowed to watch Segal during the winning streak. In particular, I remember the piano lady saying something like, ""Hey, where's my tip jar?"" and we assume that Gould took it half-jokingly (and returned it?) as he tries to get some money to gamble. He needs money and not just the Milky Way bar he tries to bet. This is still a Top 250 personal favorite movie (as are several other Altman movies like M*A*S*H, McCabe and Mrs. Miller), but without the deleted scenes, I doubt I will feel compelled to watch California Split again for another few years.

****UPDATE*** This edit and update is from 9/2/2010. What appears to be something like the original cinema release version is on Netflix as an Instant View. It appears that the Netflix DVD and the Neflix Instant View are different. All the scenes that I recalled being missing from the DVD were on the Netflix Instant version, most importantly the great scenes of Gould and the piano lady and her music during Segal's winning streak. What a relief to still be able to see and hear those scenes. 4.5 stars for the Netflix Instant View uncut (?) version.",1149206400,4,1563,4.704379562043796
2137222,5,B0002XNSZE,"Altman movies are rarely box-office champs--sometimes they are box-office duds.  Most break rules but not necessarily in an audience pleasing way. Altman's priority in making films is not in telling a story or giving the audience a roller coaster ride. He makes films to explore ideas and character or just to try something he hasn't done before.

Sometimes he slips and slides all over the place and will turn you off, at other times he get things as right as any artist working in film past or present. What he is doing interests or intrigues him and/or the actors involved--hopefully the audience will appreciate it--but that is never the most important consideration with Altman.

Altman may have been appreciated by film critics, but he rarely had a hit with general audiences and he has never won an Oscar until he was given his honorary trophy in 2006.

In 1974, the subject of gambling addiction was not in the headlines. It was Watergate front and center and politics. Altman's 1975 breakthrough- Nashville was in production and California Split was released to theaters to critical acclaim but audience indifference.

I was hoping the popularity of poker and celebrity poker programs on television would create a little more buzz around the restoration of California Split and it's DVD release a year and a half ago. It didn't happen. This Altman gem, one of his best films, is still not well known. It is not an easy film to categorize. It's not an action film, despite several funny moments it is not a comedy either. It is not one Altman's large multi-character films (Nashville, Short Cuts, Dr. T and the Women, Player, Gosford Park). It's not a romance, not a western, not a thriller, not a mystery who-done-it, fantasy or science fiction. It's a movie about several weeks in the lives of two gamblers. They meet in a Gardena (Los Angeles) poker parlor, run a little bit of a scam, and become friends shortly after they are mugged in a parking lot.

Charlie Waters (Elliott Gould) is a semi-professional small-time gambling man who likes the seemingly care-free lifestyle even though he exists on the brink of constant and nearly certain financial collapse. He doesn't really have very much to lose however. He lives in the apartment of two part-time escort -would-be-prostitutes Barbara ( Ann Prentiss) and Susan (Gwen Welles). They work just enough to pay the bills and are excited that a couple of Johns want to take them to Hawaii on a trip. It's clear all these people are living temporary lives that don't involve any kind of realistic career ambitions.

And then there is Bill Denny (George Segal) who is the editor of a successful magazine and is destroying his upper middle class lifestyle because of his gambling addiction. He is separated from his wife, he is in debt to his bookie and he's becoming more irresponsible towards the duties of his job. We watch him become so obsessed with gambling after meeting Charlie that he tries to sell everything he has--camera, real estate and car to get the stake he needs to play in the big poker tournament being held in Reno, Nevada.

We spend a lot of time with Charlie and Bill as they go on a gambling spree to poker parlors, race-tracks, casinos and bar-rooms. Most of the places are smoky and run-down seedy, either lit with garishly bright cheap fluorescent lights or poorly lit dingy hole-in-the-walls. These places buzz with the activities of drunks, losers, gamblers, thrill-seekers, hangers on, bored housewives and senior citizens, with background music supplied by the jazz-blues ballads of Phyllis Shotwell piano bar style.

Although the film has plenty of humorous moments, it depicts a bleak world inhabited by desperate people, who dress at their best like used-car salesman (from the 70s). There is an anarchy at work with their lifestyles where schedules and times are built around an after-hour world of gambling and long poker games. You can almost understand the initial attraction to this rebellious sort of un-disciplined lifestyle, but we discover it's a sad, lonely, repetitious life--even for those who win more than they lose. Most of the time the characters front and center and to the sides are not having fun as they play and gamble.

Everyone lives for the next deal, the next pot, the next roll of the dice, the promise of tomorrow. The gambling fever is insatiable inside Charlie and Bill who create side bets based on naming all seven dwarfs. Their friendship is intense but based only on their gambling exploits and pushing themselves to do more gambling.

This leads to the big stakes poker game in Reno. It is peopled by the kind of traveling professional gambling character types we've seen on television poker shows. However, we aren't sure whether we want Charlie and Bill to win. We know losing will be devastating, but they might be able to recover from it--You aren't quite sure what would happen if they win !!!

The film is full of small details. Elliot Gould and George Segal play well off each other seeming to ad-lib quite naturally all of their dialogue (much of it was actually written by Joseph Walsh). There's a road-trip breeziness to much of the film but at times it conflicts with some of the almost brutal doses of reality that are doled out to the characters at various times. We realize these characters will suffer through nearly any indignity provided that just pass the `hurdle of hurt' is another game, another bet, another hope of a win.

The film does have a truly terrible strained scene, that seems dropped into the film from some other universe. It involves the sudden introduction of a pair of transvestite `dates' of the girls Charlie lives with(for one 5 minute too long scene). Actor Bert Remsen humiliates himself with full commitment playing an old nervous transvestite (he does a great job). It's a mis-fired comedic bit that calls too much attention to itself. It feels completely artificial in a movie that had seemed utterly real previously. Thankfully the scene is not very long and the movie goes right back to being as honest and authentic as it had been before.

What distinguished this film from any other about addiction is that we are not given a morale lecture or morality lesson. There's no heavy message. We can see for ourselves how sometimes the life-style is `fun', how often it is desperate, and how it is not something to aspire to. Win or lose, there's good and bad for these characters. Who can forget Charlie recklessly trying to finagle a few bucks for himself when he is being robbed at gun-point or the look on Bill's face when he realizes he may at least temporarily be on a good luck streak?.

And ignoring the transvestite scene, there's not a Hollywood type of manufactured moment in the entire film. As we get close to a movie moment, something authentic and realistic keeps it from going into the manufactured realm. In fact it turns out the movie is one of Altman's most personal. He had a gambling addiction, he identified completely with these characters which is why he wrestled the project away from up and coming Steven Speilberg (who had t.v.'s Duel and the feature Sugarland Express under his belt at this point). That left Speilberg free to do JAWS!!!

Oh and look fast for Jeff Goldblum.

DVD STUFF

California Split is presented in an anamorphic transfer with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The film has been digitally restored but film stock imperfections and lens limitations can not be fixed.. One of the important advances Altman played with during production was the 8 track recording of sound on the set. The full 3.0 Dolby Digital soundtrack provides a vast improvement over previous video incarnations. There's a lot of over-lapping background chatter going on and you may have to train yourself to hear it (the subtitle feature does cover some of this ).

The best extra is the feature-length commentary track recorded by Robert Altman, Elliot Gould, George Segal, and writer Joseph Walsh (who we see in the film playing Segal's bookie Sparky). It's not a great commentary session but it is fun listening to the group clearly enjoying watching the film and talking about it together.

Also included are some trailers.

If you are already an Altman fan and somehow are not familiar with this film, buy it and add it to your collection.

Altman's incredible attention to detail is something to go back and savor in this little masterpiece--and I'm talking here about background detail, how everyone in the frame whether at the center or out of focus in the background is part of the scene we are watching; how we hear conversations going on just outside of the one we are supposed to be paying attention to which consists of realistic over-lapping, impossible to edit and manipulate moments that are created by actor, writer and director trusting each other completely. It's a difficult thing to do this on a creative AND technical basis. The Altman mise en scne is what sets him apart from every director working today. The fact that in most of his films several scenes are constructed to play out in real time and are mic'ed and photographed to create the kind of ambience and feeling you would have if you were sitting in the same place the characters are is nothing short of a remarkable almost incomprehensible difficult achievement. It goes beyond even what Scorcese dares to do in his best movie scenes.",1148860800,9,9397,4.830845771144278
2137223,5,B0002XNSZE,"The last Robert Altman film I saw was O.C. and Stiggs (1987), which was an interesting affair, destined for failure (it failed spectacularly), given there were three, separate forces at work there...the studio, who wanted a stupid teen comedy, the writers, who wanted something more closely akin to the original scathing and subversive material, and then Altman himself, who despised the teen comedy format and decided to do a satire.  My point is, a film like that was completely wrong for Altman, where as California Split (1974) was completely right...well that sounds a little weird...but I think you get my point, especially if you're familiar with Altman and his movies.  Produced and written by Joseph Walsh, who also appears in the film as a bookie named Sparkie, and directed by Altman, who definitely had the hot hand in the 1970s with such films as MASH (1970), McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), The Long Goodbye (1973), Nashville (1975), the film features George Segal (The Hot Rock, Fun with Dick and Jane) and Elliott Gould (MASH, Little Murders, The Long Goodbye).  Also appearing is Ann Prentiss (The Out-of-Towners), Gwen Welles (Nashville, Nobody's Fool), Jeff Goldblum (Silverado, The Fly), in one of his earliest, pimply faced roles, Bert Remsen (Brewster McCloud, Nashville), and Edward Walsh (no relation to the writer), whom I recognize distinctly from the Robert Quarry 1970 film Count Yorga, Vampire, a Brudah, the Count's thuggish valet.

The film begins in a legal card parlor, where we learn the ins and outs of high/low draw poker.  This was an exceptional sequence if only because the sly way the information was related, which serves to lay down a very strong foundation for the rest of the film.  During this time we meet the two, principal players in Bill Denny (Segal) and Charlie Waters (Gould).  Both men come from very different places (Bill works for a magazine while Charlie is what I'd call a professional hustler), but both share a love for `the action', meaning they're both saddled with a gambling monkey on their backs.  The two men meet while sharing a game of cards, as another player accuses Charlie of cheating, claiming Bill, who was dealing, was in on it...from here the men develop an instant camaraderie, both recognizing their common interest.  They hook up with Charlie's ditzy roommates (who happen to be female escorts), Barbara (Prentiss) and Susan (Welles), and the four engage in fun and games.  Soon after Charlie disappears (he ends up at a dog track in Tijuana), while we learn Bill is in debt up to his eyeballs with a bookie who is deeply interested in collecting.  Out of desperation, Bill sells all his possessions (the ones with value, at least), as he's planning on going to Reno and score big.  Right around this time Charlie shows up, and the two men decide to partner up...things get a little crazy from here on, as Bill's in the zone, but luck can turn quickly, and streaks can sour...will Bill and Charlie break the bank, or leave flat busted?  It's like they always say, you win some, and you lose some...

If you're not familiar with Altman's films then you should know they don't so much focus on a plot, but more so on the characters, and few do character driven films as well as Altman, at least in my experience.  This is an excellent film, and both Segal and Gould are wonderful.  Bill is a working man, drawn to the action like a moth to a flame, trying to balance the various aspects of his life until the fallout of his passions begins to catch up to him.  Charlie, on the other hand, is more open and accepting of his desires, as gambling is his work, only taking on conventional jobs when he's in need of working capital to continue gambling.  Most of the time he's able to get by off his winnings (and charm), carrying him over to the next game.  The two men eventually hook up and Bill is drawn into the excitement of gambling as a profession (if you've got the skills, it can be done).  The characters, while often strange, felt very authentic (in a seedy sort of way) and completely human.  Another aspect that works so well in this film is the strong script.  My favorite give and take comes not from the main players, but two incidental characters in a bar.  Bill's in a bar, pondering the desperation of his situation (you know, the thing with the bookie), and there's some trashy, loudmouthed broad griping about how her fufu dog dumps on her floors, along with her displeasure towards her current surroundings...

Dumpy Broad: `What the f*** am I doing in this dump anyway?  You should've seen the place where I was last night.  It was real classy.'

Straight-Faced Bartender: `Any chance you could go back there?'

Now that in and of itself is a classically beautiful comeback, and if the exchange ended there it would have been fine, but the line that follows, from the oblivious dame, is the cherry on top...

Dumpy Broad: `No, classy places don't open this early.'

Now it sounds like she was giving a shot back, but in reality, she made the last statement as a matter of fact (as she saw the facts), completely in the dark that the bartender had given an appropriate shot with regards to her initial comment.  By the way, the bartender in this sequence was played by Jack Riley, who should be familiar to fans of The Bob Newhart Show as the perpetually morose Mr. Carlin.  All in all I thought this was a great film, and if you're an Altman fan, you really should try and catch this one.

The picture quality on this DVD, presented in widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1), looks very clean, yet slightly fuzzy...something inherent in a number of films from the 1970s.  It wasn't perfectly clear, but then neither were the characters, so perhaps it was intentional.  The Dolby Digital 3.0 audio comes through very clean.  As far as extras, there isn't a lot, but there is an entertaining commentary track featuring director Altman, writer Walsh, along with stars Gould and Segal.  Also included are some unrelated previews for the films Easy Rider (1969). Big Night (1996), and The Company (2003).

By the way, the title of my review comes from a sequence near the beginning when Charlie sort of talks a woman out of betting on a horse at the track to which she had a good feeling about, only to win big himself on said horse.  The woman discovers what happened, and angrily begins lobbing oranges at both Charlie and Bill, who are riding the escalator, Bill completely unaware of Charlie's actions, starts throwing them back.  The complete quote features an expletive, one I doubt Amazon would let me post, so to get the rest, see the film...it's worth it...",1134518400,3,6660,4.726643598615917
2137224,5,B0002XNSZE,"I was pleased to see that Robert Altman directed this film, and it probably explains why it is devoid of that cheesy seventies feeling you get from productions which were its contemporaries. The setting of the film takes place in a Bukowski-esque world made up of call girls, gambling, horses, and all the anarchy one would expect. Their lives are someplace you would not mind visiting, but are nowhere you would like to live.

California split accomplishes quite a bit as it successfully depicts a fast moving, male friendship which captures the adrenaline junkie mentality of many a compulsive gambler. The word ""action"" is referred to again and again, and the lust for action is what drives behaviors which are inexplicable to the rest of us. Personally, Elliot Gould is as good here as he was in M.A.S.H. In fact, this might be his best performance ever. He is the yin to George Seigel's yang. He is in constant motion. Gould takes off to Tijuana after a dream involving the city, and thoroughly lives for the moment; whereas, Seigel is not able to escape his life even for a day. He has roots and responsibility while Gould is on a conveyer belt to who knows where. This difference goes far in explaining the film's ending. This one is a bittersweet ride that's more fun that bitter. You definitely will enjoy it as it has aged like Bordeaux.",1128038400,3,1347,4.6835443037974684

2137228,4,B0002XNSZE,"California Split is Robert Altman's take on the classic buddy movie.  It tells the story of two hard-core gamblers, Bill Denny, played by George Segal, and Charlie Waters, played by Elliott Gould, who, after a chance meeting, take off on a long and unexpectedly successful spree binge that takes them from their native Los Angeles to a high-stakes poker game in Reno.

I love this picture, even though, as I explain below, Altman is something of an acquired taste. The first point is that because Altman cares about actors, he gets great performances from them. California Split is worth watching simply to see the extraordinary by-play between George Segal and Elliot Gould.  They obviously liked working with each other, and they portray realistically idiotic and lovable louts, incapable of maintaining serious lives, relationships or jobs because the gambling gets in the way.  Maybe the best-known scene in the movie is one in which these two addled and somewhat drunken dopes try to recall the names of Disney's seven dwarves.  It's a very short scene, but it is poignant and funny at the same time, which is the tone of the best part of this picture.

The other remarkable thing is how brilliantly Altman captured the world of small-time gamblers.  This movie was made in 1974, long before the World Series of Poker became a staple of ESPN, when hard-core gambling was restricted to tiny corners of the nation.  The verisimilitude of the casino and bar scenes is so terrific its as if he used no actors at all, just went into the casinos and started shooting. Altman got it all, the smoke, the crazy characters, the sleaze, and oh yes, the insane excitement of winning.

The rap on Altman is that he couldn't tell a story, and there's some merit to the charge.  In truth, Altman, who grew up in the television business, was completely capable of telling a story, it just wasn't his primary interest. Altman is more interested in his characters, and how they interact with each other, than with producing classic Hollywood story-arc movies. To some extent, all of his movies contained an at-best loosely connected series of vignettes, rather than traditional tight plotting.  In his most commercially successful movies, like Nashville and M*A*S*H, there was just enough story line to carry audiences; in other movies, and California Split falls into this category, the story line is either so weak or so implausible that audiences didn't like the movies he made, because they seemed shapeless.  But the point is, you don't watch his movies for the plot lines; there's always Bruckheimer and Simpson for that.  You watch Altman movies because he gets these fabulous performances out of actors, and because he takes you places other people can't or won't.  If you like movies, you won't regret watching California Split.",1106524800,9,2824,4.955508474576271
2137229,3,B0002XNSZE,"Robert Altman: Iconoclast, maverick, annoyance. You either love him or hate him. When I ponder Robert Altman, I think of M.A.S.H., Nashville, and The Long Goodbye. California Split is a mixed bag, with some excellent scenes and dialogue (including the famous ""Seven Dwarves"" sequence), but overall, I consider this one of his lesser works. There are too many long, drawn-out scenes which seem to go nowhere. The female leads are terrible, and the ending is unsatisfying.

The gambling scenes are first rate, especially in depicting George Segal as a hopeless degenerative gambler who can't stop to save his bacon. Elliott Gould plays a loveable goof as only Elliott Gould can. The scene in the restaurant between Segal and his shylock is priceless. The robbery scene in the parking lot is hysterical. In the end, these great scenes cannot sustain the whole movie, and as a result there are long moments that are soporific and boring.

I love parts of this movie, and I would recommend at least one viewing. For me it was hit and miss, but then again, I'm not an absolute Robert Altman fan, so maybe I don't ""get it.""",1106006400,4,1116,4.807291666666667
2137230,5,B0002XNSZE,"In the 1970s, Elliott Gould and Robert Altman were an unbeatable team. They first worked together on M*A*S*H, a savage satire of the military, then again on a radical, contemporary reworking of Raymond Chandler's novel, The Long Goodbye, and finally completed the hat trick with California Split, an ode to obsessive gamblers. For years, this film has been relegated to obscurity, showing up occasionally on TV and tied up in legal issues over the music which delayed its release on DVD. Finally, all of these entanglements have been resolved and the movie is presented the way it was meant to be seen.

California Split is one of Altman's trademark character-driven films. It is less concerned with plot than behaviour as we watch the friendship between Bill and Charlie develop over a mutual love of gambling. As the film progresses and the two men hang out more, Bill starts to become more addicted to the gambling lifestyle. He blows off work early to meet Charlie at the track and sells his possessions for money. Bill and Charlie are gambling addicts who ride the high arcs and the low valleys, never passing up a bet. At a boxing match they put money on the outcome of the fight with a fellow spectator.

Those who know Elliott Gould and George Segal only from their contemporary sitcom appearances (Friends and Just Shoot Me, respectively), should see California Split if only to see these guys in their prime and working with a master filmmaker at the top of his game. Gould and Segal have never been better and play well of each other. There is good chemistry between them as Gould plays the more experienced gambler in contrast to Segal's more nave one.

Altman fans will enjoy the audio commentary included on this DVD. It features the director, the film's screenwriter Joseph Walsh, Gould and Segal. They point out that all the extras in the opening sequence were ex-drug addicts. Altman and Walsh talk in detail about the filmmaking process with the latter pointing out the authenticity of the gambling lifestyle as depicted in the movie. Everyone recounts amusing anecdotes on this relaxed, informative track.

California Split is not afraid to show the ugly side of gambling. Bill sells his car and his possessions for a big poker game in Reno. Charlie exacts a rough, bloody revenge on the guy who mugged him at the beginning of the movie. These are not always likeable guys and to Altman's credit he doesn't try to romanticize or judge them, leaving that up to the audience. California Split is arguably Altman's loosest film in terms of plot and one of the richest in terms of character and observing their behaviour.",1102377600,31,2636,4.825221238938053
2137231,2,B0002XNSZE,"Nashville and The Long Goodbye are two of my favorite films of all time.  Both are masterpieces of cinema that I can pretty much watch any time.  This is unfortunately very weak Altman in my book with a terrible performance by George Segal.  The film starts great and has a nice realistic feel to most of the proceedings and then spirals downhill for the rest of the film without any real sense of direction or purpose.  The cinematography and Elliot Gould's performance keep you watching for the most part but this film grated on me after I awhile.  If you want a really good gambling movie about loveable loser's who've lost their way then check out PTA's Hard Eight(Sydney)...Probably the best film about the dark and seedy world of gambling ever made.  The fact is ""Split"" doesn't even work as a comedy...The only real humor in the film (which is funny mind you-don't get me wrong) comes from minstrel tunes and Gould's trying to figure out all the names of the seven dwarfs.  Otherwise this is a serious disspointment from one of America's most innovative filmmakers.",1102291200,7,1072,4.731182795698925
2137232,4,B0002XNSZE,"In Robert Altman's wonderful CALIFORNIA SPLIT (Columbia Tristar), there's something endearing and frightening about the shared compulsion to gamble by new best buddies George Segal and Elliot Gould. Some of Altman's lesser known films (""Images"" and ""Secret Honor"") are getting a lot of deserved if belated attention in their new digital editions and this is one his very best.  (On the DVD box, a blurb by Robert Ebert claims it is ""better than MASH"" and I agree.  I just wonder who Robert Ebert is.  Could it be a brother of Roger or is it a typo?)

Essentially a buddy road trip turned inside out, Gould and Segal are two losers who share their disease as they willingly risk it all for the thrill of, well, risk itself.  For them, it's not about winning big to buy a new life but rather losing big as proof of life. But make no mistake, while ""California Split"" may be an accurate picture of compulsive gambling, it is also wildly funny and weirdly upbeat.  A terrific extra is the revealing commentary with Altman, Gould, Segal and writer Joseph Walsh.",1101254400,3,1056,4.681081081081081

The story is a little ramshackle...but that's part of the charm. You follow two gamblers as they roam around California looking for action, they win...sometimes...and lose...more...get beat up a couple times...and eventually travel to Reno for the grand finale. The acting is perfect, Elliot Gould has never been better and George Segal gives a great haggard performance. The sound is Altman at his most layered. The whole film is rich in detail and heavy on atmosphere and most viewers will need to watch a couple times to really enjoy. If you think 'Rounders' is a great poker film...see this one. And for once he commentary on this DVD is great (too often commentary is boring 'oh yeah, that actor was wonderful, that actress was amazing, etc.. without explaining how the film got made, etc) They don't make 'em like this anymore.
