8274751,5,B0019N5ANE,"I had seen all but Flyboys before and greatly enjoyed them. I did so again on Blu Ray (even better). I watched Flyboys for the first time this weekend. This is a pretty darn good movie. Kind of sad at the end, no, make that downright sad at the end. Kind of like Titanic was only different. Still, it is very well done.",1239580800,,319,4.079365079365079
8274752,5,B0019N5ANE,"I have been a fan of war films for longer than I can remember.  Two of my all time favorites are ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Battle of Britain"".  These two films are from the decade of the 1970's.  Their attention to detail ranks 4 on a scale of 5 (1-worse to 5-great), which helps the veiwer to understand what people looked and acted like during WW2.  Of course, the all star cast for both films helps also.  These two films have action aplenty. ""Bridge Too Far"" is the story of the near success of Operation Market Garden, the attempt by the Allies to end the war before Christmas 1944.  ""Battle of Britain"" is just that, the story of the Battle of Britain in the late summer/early fall of 1940, when Nazi Germany tried to bomb Churchill's Great Britain into submission.  Both films are on the mark, historically, and provide plenty of suspense.

""Flyboys"" is about the volunteer American air unit ""Lafayette Escadrille"" during WW1, when the United States was officially neutral.  Even though alot of the air action is computer created, the film gives a very good telling of how young Americans wanted to fight Imperial Germany and stop ""the Hun"" before he took over all of Europe.

The Blu-Ray copies are excellent, with vivid colors and no defects.

If you want to watch a war film on your Blu-Ray player, here is three which you will enjoy.",1230595200,6,1342,4.573221757322176
