8593307,5,B00DHN8GL2,"I bought this blu-ray because when this film was being made, I worked at a hamburger stand at 24th and Nueces St. in Austin called Mad Dogs and Beans and the guys on the crew would come by for milkshakes or burgers.  They were all super nice.  We asked them what they were doing and they were like, ""Making a movie called 'Slacker'"" which was hilarious, because we were all slackers at this point in time.  I laughed because it seemed improbable that they would actually complete a coherent movie... which is sort of what happened.  But I can assure anyone paying attention that this movie accurately depicts the various characters who would wander the streets of Austin in those days, citing poetry or conspiracy theories and talking to anyone who would listen.  It was a very fun time to be a kid in college.  Thank you Rick for committing some of those memories to celluloid for posterity's sake.  When people wonder about Austin in the early 90s I can show them this movie.",1493942400,2,977,4.580459770114943
8593308,1,B00DHN8GL2,"""How much longer?""...that is pretty much what I was thinking after about the first 10 minutes of this bore-fest.  I get how some people like the idea of a slice of life for various Austin residents and have the ""Yeah but, those are amateur actors and it only cost $3k to shoot and blah blah blah...""  A decent idea does not make for a good movie.  The characters and their respective conversations were just flat out BORING!

Honestly, I have always heard Austin is a really cool city but I hope this movie and these characters are not a true representation.  It made it seem like a really boring city with uninteresting people that are all obnoxious pseudo-intellectuals that talk about nothing.  Not in the fun Seinfeld nothing way but in a just literal uninteresting nothing conversation.  I think hanging out with retirees in Boca Raton would be more fun and interesting than talking to any of these losers.  Yes, I get it...the characters are loser slackers but it is just a waste of a movie.

Obviously, Linklater improved on his craft and his writing but this is not one that I would ever recommend or watch again in a million years.  Just horrible writing/dialog.  I can forgive bad acting but the writing was a pile of garbage.  Not once, did I think ""well, that is kind of interesting at least"".  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this sleeping pill of a movie.",1479945600,,1376,4.56734693877551
8593309,5,B00DHN8GL2,"Understandable how this film inspired Kevin Smith to make films. If for nothing else that would be enough. But alas, that is just a fraction of it's ""classic"" moniker. A title often over used but in this case is quite sufficient. If you love movies and appreciate Richard Linklater's films, his first is a must. See the man himself in the opening scene. This is a must see.",1433894400,,373,4.5
8593310,5,B00DHN8GL2,"The commentary tracks are a good addition.  I enjoyed seeing all the behind the scenes filming, and the dialogue of the many places that were ""locations"" during the filming.",1425600000,,173,4.9655172413793105
8593311,5,B00DHN8GL2,"Richard Linklater was always spawning ideas about our society and why do we live this way when we should take action. In his first film, Slacker, Linklater focuses on forty different college dropouts and their lives. This is a film I can't really explain to you. It's not necessarily a story, but more of a documentary on urban city life in Austin, Texas. The characters being portrayed are usually non-socialists who happen to drop by different groups and what discussions they come across. Linklater does a supreme job of capturing moments of thought processes and characters with flaws. He also happens to do many one shots in where the camera focuses on that one person and then progresses to the next even if it's only a few minutes. What I really love about this film is how it explains life itself. How our conspiracies form over time. How our obsessions are a part of us, and never falter because it's the only thing that makes us something. It's a highly recommended film that I believe the misanthropes, loners, or outsiders should definitely watch. Definitely changed my life. Linklater your awesome!",1374278400,17,1111,4.852631578947369
