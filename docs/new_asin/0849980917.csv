8324443,5,0849980917,"Serial killer Ted Bundy turned down many requests from the mass media, but just hours before his execution he granted an interview with Dr. James Dobson, and part of it is included in this video.  What an incredible look at the drug-like addiction and devastation of pornography on people's lives.  As he points out, obscenity is not a victimless crime.  It mostly contains an interesting speech about pornography from Dr. Dobson to a group of teens, but the confession from a serial killer was certainly a rare piece for me.  I would highly recommend this video, especially for those who are raising teenagers or will be soon.",1299974400,2,627,4.831775700934579
8324444,5,0849980917,"This video documentary is no fun to watch, but is a must-see for all those who have internet connections, which these days is just about all of us.  A frank, no pulled-punches assessment of the effects of pornography.",1210550400,4,217,4.7105263157894735
