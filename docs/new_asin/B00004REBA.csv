7921201,1,B00004REBA,"I was hoping to obtain the Burl Ives movie that I enjoyed so much as a kid.  Unfortunately, what I received was a lesser quality different animation directed by Max Fleischer (from about the same time period) (30 minutes - Goodtimes Kids Klassics - not!)).  I wound up throwing it into the trash to avoid further pollution of the better Rudolph.  Luckily, I only paid two dollars for it used.
If you are looking for the same one you remember as a kid, make sure you receive the Burl Ives version.",1014768000,5,496,4.428571428571429
