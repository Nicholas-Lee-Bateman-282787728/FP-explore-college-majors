7948928,4,B00005OCMA,"ok first let me say, if you are looking for blood guts and gore, don't buy this dvd. It is basic bog standard indy wrestling. But if like me you are looking for a better insight ito the early cactus jack matches, this DVD is for you. Ok so it is short at 5 matches in 55 mins but its just great seeing what a young impressionable Mick Foley Is like at an early stage of his career. It was pleasurable to watch but if you are an ECW, or WWF Attitude fan this aint for you. All in all well worth the money",1078358400,,503,3.8461538461538463
7948929,4,B00005OCMA,"1.  Steve Austin did steal Chris Addams' wife, but he didn't steal Jarrett's.  Debra was not Double J's wife, she was Steve ""Mongo"" McMichaels' wife. 2.  The IWA King of the Death Matches DVD is NOT the best place to look for better Foley matches.  It's okay, but really just a series of repetetive bloodbaths (although with a nice Severn vs Goto NWA Title Match thrown in) of interest only to those who have no real interest in WRESTLING.  I'm all for a good brawl, otherwise Cactus Jack wouldn't be my favorite wrestler, and I actually enjoy watching a match or two from the KODM tourney from time to time, but to sit thru the whole thing is very mind numbing. The TRUE best place to look for a glimpse at Foley's greatest creative period is the ECW ""Best of Cactus Jack"" DVD.  Nothing to speak of in the area of extras really, but who needs extras when you've got all the stuff that is in the main body of the DVD?  Every major match, angle, and promo is featured, from his first ECW match against Sabu (while Foley was actually still contracted to WCW, no less) to his glorious finale against Mikey and all points in between.",1023148800,2,1129,4.399038461538462
7948930,3,B00005OCMA,"Before Mankind, there was Cactus Jack.  An indy wrestler too crazy for the WWF and WCW.  These matches are from the GWF and WCCW in Texas around 1989-90.  These ratings are also reflective of the time so a 1989 *** match might be a ** match today.
Cactus Jack vs. Terry Gordy - Terry was one of the best and a precursor to Cactus Jack.  Jack takes an absolutely sick powerbomb on the hardwood floor. *** For the bump alone.
Cactus Jack vs. Eric Embry - And the WWF says Chris Benoit is too short to be marketable!  Jack gives an interview with Scotty the Body (Raven).  Jack is allowed to show his nutty streak and gets in a lot of offense. ***
Cactus Jack vs. Mike Hernandez - Skandor Akbar does a lot of commentary on this match, so it's hard to watch.  Not much going on either. **
Cactus Jack and Gary Young vs. Jeff Jarrett and Chris Addams - The box says Matt Bourne, but this is clearly Addams.  Addams and Jarrett have the unique distinction of both having their wives/girlfriends stolen by Steve Austin.  This is mostly a Jarrett/Addams match.  Very formulaic but good. ***1/2
Cactus Jack vs. Jimmy Jack Funk - No relation to Terry or Dory.  Jimmy Jack has both the worst name and the worst mask in WCCW.  Most of the match centers around an armbar before Jack takes over.  Big bumps ensue. **
Keep in mind these matches were from the first stages of Jack's career and he was just learning the ropes.  For a better example of Cactus Jack's exploits find the IWA King of the Death Match.  Over all a pretty cheap DVD made to cash in on later stardom, but for people who remember the old days of WCCW this is good for nostalgia. Recommended for Cactus completests and WCCW fans only.",1017792000,,1690,4.354632587859425
7948931,4,B00005OCMA,"Long before he revolutionized the world of Sports Entertainment as the Hardcore Legend, before he became a best-selling author, before he became the Heavyweight champion of the world, even before he first rose to big-time national prominence in WCW and ECW, Mick Foley was a hot rookie named Cactus Jack traveling the country and trying to make a name for himself.  One of his earliest stops was in the legendary WCCW/USWA promotion based out of Dallas, Texas in the late 80s/early 90s.  This bargain priced DVD chronicles 5 of his matches out of his stay in the USWA.
Here are the contents of this DVD:
THE MATCHES
1. Cactus Jack vs. Terry ""Bam Bam"" Gordy:  The late Terry ""Bam Bam"" Gordy (passed away in 2001) was a highly respected name in the business.  He was one of the original ""Fabulous Freebirds"" who ran roughshod through the South in the late 70s and the 1980s.  He was also one of the most successful Gaijin wrestlers in Japan.  Overall, this was a brutal slugfest between two of the best brawler/wrestlers in the business.  5 minutes.  3 stars.
2. Cactus promo with Joe Pedecino.  Short, but a great highlight showing Foley's legendary mic skills at an early stage in his career.
3. Foley (champ) w/ General Skandor Akbar vs. Eric Embry (challenger) for the Light Heavyweight Title: Yes, Foley was THE LHW champ.  He was a LOT slimmer then and the weight division had weird cutoffs allowing both Foley and Embry (real pudgy guys) to compete. Embry was THE top star of the USWA during this time period.  Akbar was one of the feds top heel managers for YEARS.  The crowd was HOT for this match which saw Foley basically beat the tar out of Embry.  Pretty brutal.  Post-match run-in by ""Gorgeous"" Gary Young.  10 minutes.  3 stars.
4. Foley w/ Akbar vs. Mike Hernandez:  Akbar promo precedes the match.  Hernandez was just a typical jobber.  The match was basically a jobber squash for Foley but the crowd was HOT for this as well.  All-star USWA Post-Match run-ins by Embry, Young and Brickhouse Brown.  5 minutes.  DUD match but 5 stars for the run-ins.
5. Foley and Gary Young vs. ""Simply Irresistible"" Jeff Jarrett and ""Gentleman"" Chris Adams:  Young was a Memphis/USWA mainstay.  Jarrett is indeed the former WCW champion ""Chosen One"" Jeff Jarrett/WWF  mid-carder ""Double J"" as a young cruiserweight rookie.  The late Chris Adams (passed away in 2001) was a legendary main eventer in Texas/WCCW/USWA famous for his feuds with the Von Erichs, Terry Taylor and a young Steve Austin.  He was in fact Steve Austin's trainer/teacher.  Overall, this was the best match on the DVD with a great combination of mat wrestling and high flying action (courtesy of Jarrett).  The crowd was hot for this one.  10 minutes.  4 stars.  Post-match run-ins by Iceman Parson and Brickhouse Brown.
6. Foley w/Akbar vs. Jimmy Jack Funk:  Funk's gimmick (a leftover from a short stint in the WWF) was that he was the ""craziest"" of the legendary Funk wrestling family (Dory, Dory Jr. and Terry).  Of course he was not and was actually a Barr who had a more famous brother, the late Art Barr.  In this storyline Funk, a proud Texan was defending Texas pride against anti-American/anti-Texan Akbar. This match was typically what would be called by good old J.R. a ""Slobber Knocker.""  Great back and forth slugfests by two brawlers.  Again, the crowd was HOT for this match.  Gotta love that Texas crowds!!!  15 minutes.  4 stars.  Post-match run-ins by Gary Young and the Super Black Ninja (a young Great Muta/Keiji Mutoh).
THE DVD Extras
The extras on the DVD are somewhat laughable.  Included on this DVD (and the other 4 in this series) are:
1. A slide show of stills from various matches in this series.
2. A trivia quiz on Foley and the matches featured on this DVD.
In other words, the extras are all right for a look but otherwise are throwaways...
THE VERDICT:
Overall, at... the cover price,... this DVD is actually quite the bargain.  The matches and extras are a little sparse, but they are golden for wrestling nostalgists.  The matches themselves, while not overly great, aren't that bad and are quite entertaining.
This DVD is definitely must viewing for Foley fans/enthusiasts/completists.  Fans of the WCCW/USWA circa `89/'90 will also appreciate this DVD.
This is definitely a rental if you are looking strictly for the action.  The action is decent but not a must-see.  The true value in this is for collectors, particularly Foley fans or USWA (Embry, Adams, etc) fans.  It's a great look at the genesis of the career of one of Sports Entertainment's most influential stars.
