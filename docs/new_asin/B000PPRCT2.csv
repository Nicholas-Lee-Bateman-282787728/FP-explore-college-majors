2827523,3,B000PPRCT2,"First, a disclaimer on whether the reported apparitions of Medjugorje are true or false, they have not been approved nor dissapproved by the Holy Mother Church, the Roman Catholic Church. This is a movie review and it easily could merit being a four star movie in my opinion as well but I'll give it three, when comparing it to other religious movies and other apparition-type movies like ""Song of Bernadette"" or ""The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima."" Additionally, there probably are ""touchy"" points here, like relations between the local Archbishop and Priests at Medjugorje, however, it seems that all sides have been treated respectfully though of course, we most likely see the circumstances in a beneficial light to the local Franciscan Fathers.

Roger Ebert wrote that if a story treats Medjugorje, then it should be about the purported apparitions of the Madonna and the messages, he said that is the story. Here, the story really is about Father Jozo Zovko played by Martin Sheen. Medjugorje, the place and the incidences form the backdrop...but to me, this movie is like a backdrop, start it up and do some work, but keep some attention to it but it doesn't have to be absolute. For the uninitiated, Father Zovko is a priest who helped out the young 5 or 6 visionaries when they first occurred in 1981.

As far as I'm concerned, Martin Sheen's heart is in this like nothing else I've seen him do except the ""Court Martial of Private Eddie Slovic"" and ""Wallstreet"" comes close as well.  He might have made a good Franciscan Priest at that but I must admit, this really isn't a great movie but I understand it was made on a low budget. I read one review that was not happy about some of the extras in this movie, but I honestly believe they must have gotten townspeople from the area of Medjugorje in Bosnia-Hercogovina and maybe up from Croatia as well and actually dub in from Serbo-Croat to what they say in English. What is that line somewhere in the movie? ""Get out of here troublemaker""; yes, I think these lines are dubbed. Obviously, it was filmed there, cerca 1995.

This is an interesting film and I haven't been to Medjugorje, a friend of mine who has 3 times I don't believe greatly appreciated this movie, because again, it just touches on the apparitions. Because I have read a lot of literature on the wars in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, it held some interest for me.",1210636800,,2395,4.668246445497631

2827535,2,B000PPRCT2,"If Martin Sheen performed in his earlier films as he does in Gospa, I doubt he would have been famous. It will inform you of the controversial apparition. Probably best for someone who has never heard of Medjugorje.",1500681600,,215,4.684210526315789
2827536,3,B000PPRCT2,"I am ambivalent about this movie. Although I like the subject matter, the movie did not stir me as other's have. What I remember most about the film is Martin Sheen getting beaten by the Communists. And that is not what I should take away from this movie. I should be left with some vivid imagery of the miracle of Medjugorje, of the trial the children faced as they stuck to their stories about having seen the Virgin Mary. About the truly miraculous conversions that have happened there, about the bravery of the entire community. This was a time of war when no one was allowed to talk about God openly. Yet these children insisted they had seen, and talked to, and touched the Mother of God. There is little here of the scientific tests done while they were in their trance. Little to demonstrate that this is a true story. Its a film that showcases Martin Sheen as evidenced on the cover of the package.",1490313600,2,907,4.469879518072289

2827694,5,B000PPRCT2,"I am giving this movie 5 stars because of its spiritual depth.
Superficially the mix of American and Croatian accents is a bit silly. Why do the children have a Croatian accent (lovely local actors) yet the priest of tne parish , Martin sheen , has an American accent and Morgan Fairchild, his sister, a nun, alternates an American and European type accent.  However, once the story gets going, this annoying mess disappears and the power of the story driven by Sheen's sheer talent for earnestly walking in the shoes of the priest he is portraying takes over.

We tend to think these miraculous places of pilgrimage were birthed in peace but not so  medjugorje. The children to whom mother Mary appeared live under the crushing weight of fear with which the communist regime keep the Villagers in line. But so pure are their souls that they simply see and tell the truth of the appearance of Mary. And this is where the movie goes deep into the fundamental truths of spirituality and religion on our planet now. The actor who plays the communist party big wig gives the entire movie it's vehicle for delving into the real truths. He says to a lower party official with complete assured command that he does not believe in God because he has never seen him. It's a simple sentence that is the earthquake of the movie. You realize then that both he and tne children hold absolute belief in their truths. Yes they are at opposite ends of the spectrum but you feel that both are fully at peace with their beliefs and this leads us to what I call the inbetweens-- the priests and the lower party officials. These two groups are suffering in this drama. When the priest, Martin sheen, is arrested and brought in for interrogation and torture ( the communist arrest him for working against the regime by supporting the children) a lower party official begs him to recant. The village communist says that his wife and sisters go to his church and he can't bear the torture  to continue but he won't give up his party affiliation clearly because of the perks if the power and fear of retaliation if he angers the communist brass. Yet there is this clear inner struggle with this official. You can see he wonders if there is truth to the children's visions. And what if God really does exist and he is rejecting divinity for worldly things. Sheens character also struggles because he vows to protect the children from tne communists but he is almost jealous that he as an avowed man of God has never seen God or the Virgin Mary. Why? This becomes a personal deep pain. Why the children and not him. Ultimately he puts this away and fights fir the children withstanding, jail, beatings and a trumped up trial against him. He becomes a hero for believing what he can't see. And he even says st one point that that is his strength and calling. The ""inbetweens""
On both sides are trying to find a way to live a life based on belief but it's shaky. And ultimately tne only group in this movie in complete peace and happiness are the children. Sheens priest comes to his spiritual peace through them even though he aches to see mother Mary.

And in tne end as well the communist loose the fight with mother Mary! Millions of pilgrims have been to
Medjugorje  and continue to flock there. And that communist regime is a distant memory.
And we go full circle back to tne communist big wig who says he's never seen God. All can see God reflected in the Madonna of Medjugorje. God is there today, not the communists.

First make the comparison fom old to new testament and you will see mary si clearly the arc of the new covenant and angels have been used by God to deliver messages since the beginning. Why would he stop now? Even martin Luthaaaaaaa was a marionologist. Most protestant sects are less then 100 years old, created because of mans pride as they want to be God and man made religions like Protestantism says quite clearly that Jesus must follow them, becaus not a single one of you follow Jesus.

I was hoping to see a film which included the inner life of the children of Medjugorje, but this was more about the harassment of the priest of their church. It was well done, but be aware that the political situation in Yugoslavia was not inspiring.

Have you seen some of the reviews guys write on amazon for movies ?  Paragraphs long praising of shots, and camera work,  lens and color scheme ... yikes ...that's not me.  But this movie is so startlingly bad as a movie.  The music is painful for a movie not about robots, the camera lens is terrible, I have seen better home movie pictures from the 60's, the shots are distractingly bad. In a scene with two actors in conversation are they are positioned in the bottom left corner of the screen with the camera focused on back of Martin's head  and 75 percent of the picture is hardwood floor. Ever heard of moving a chair folks?  That's just one example of 100 bad shots in the first 15 minutes. And my standards for this sort of thing are not high. I didn't even know I had any til they were so offended by this thing.

I am a devout Catholic and I know the church doesn't obligate us to believe in private revelations such as these visions. Look into this and do some research. You will find a lot of information that the church is not going to approve these visions and for good reason. Since the church has already approved other private revelations such as Fatima and Lourdes I can choose those devotions if I wish but what I have read about these visions is just very sad.

What we got was a horrible, Hollywood-esque rendition of a story that should've and could've been presented more reverently and with much better substance and quality. I just can't say enough BAD things about this movie. We were able to glean a few tidbits of interesting information about the apparitions from what was presented, but, my husband and I both agreed that a good book or documentary about Medjugorje would've been much more entertaining and 100 times less painful than this turd of a production. I suppose that, in the future, we will learn to RUN, not walk, away from any material that features Morgan Fairchild portraying a nun. Ugh! Another facet that really disturbed us was that there were many swear words in this supposedly religious film. GD's, JC's, bitch and balls were all uttered. Just icing on the cake to make us want to crack this dvd in half and try to forget the agony and pain this unbelievably poorly scripted and badly acted film inflicted upon us for 2 torturous hours and 5 torturous minutes.

2827744,1,B000PPRCT2,"Unfortunately for so many well intentioned people, the FACT is that the so-called ""apparitions"" are NOT of the Blessed Virgin.  The Church has declared them to NOT be of God.  It is, under Church Law, the local Ordinary's (Bishop) duty and right to investigate such so-called apparitions and declare whether or not they are worthy of belief. The local Bishop has declared them (decades ago) to be not of God.  The fact that the supposed apparition said ""All religions are equally pleasing to God"" is only one of many heretical statements to come out of this abominable travesty.

The fierce disobedience and defiance by the ""faithful"" and even clergy against the Bishop is another proof it is unholy. A common defiance seen is the puffed up statement that ""The Pope hasn't declared it to be false.""  Well, that is not the Pope's job; it is the local Bishop whose place it is to make such decisons.  But that is not good enough for prideful disobedient souls who seem to think they know better than the Bishop.  (One can see the devil at work in these cases) The supposed ""seers"" ride around in sports cars, have been caught in numerous lies and do not show any signs of having been influenced by the Blessed Virgin.  They are worldly and not to be believed.  I am ware there are many good and well intentioned people who have gone to Medjugorge, but you have been deceived.

Furthermore, Our Lady would not have been a part of this marketing scheme to make millions of dollars from the tourism that these alleged ""visionaries"" have raked in for the disobedient and liberal leaning local priests.

2827820,2,B000PPRCT2,"I spent the summer of 1988 in the former Yugoslavia. I made it a point to make a visit to Medjugorje and had one of the most memorable visits in my life. I saw this DVD on Amazon, but I failed to read this description. I assumed this was a documentary narrated by Martin Sheen and Michael York. It is not a documentary but a movie based on the events of 1981 when 6 children claimed to have visitations by the Virgin Mary.
Unfortunately, this movie is not about the children and their visions but rather the story of the parish priest Father Zovko who becomes enamored with the fame and glory now associated with Medugorje. Sadly, an inpsiring and beautiful story is turned into a low quality TV movie with some high class actors. There is even a lovely Morgan Fairchild, without make-up, as a pious nun. The two fellow priests in the parish are two actors I have seen regularlty on TV. Great cast in a very low budget film. As the story unfolds, the screen goes to black for a few seconds as if we are cutting to a non existent commercial break. There is no transition between major scenes and the music is seriously annoying and low budget. Even the title credits are simple computer generated letters.
I wondered how Martin Sheen, Michael York and Morgan Fairchild became involved in low quality production such as this one.
My visit to Medugorje was a very moving and profound experience. It was wonderful to see the beautiful and modest church in Medugorje. I recognized a few locations in the film so it was nice to relive the memory of my visit. Once I found out this was a film, I assumed it would be about the children and their visions of the Virgin Mary. It was not. This turned out to be a film about Father Zovko's troubles with the communist government. His religious sermons seemed to be encouraging political change in Yugoslavia and the powers that be were not pleased.
Yes, there is a story here but somehow everything gets lost. Michael York gives a fine performance as the fiery lawyer defending Father Zovko in court.
This is a story about Father Zovko and the 6 children are more a side story. We really don't know much about their visions and what the Virgin Mary's message was to them other than to pray for peace and to fast. The children seem to be in a trance with little to say and there is little explanation about what they are experiencing.
This is an odd movie for another reason. The main characters are either American or British speaking with their normal accents. The lesser actors speak English but with a Croatian accent. It all seems so out of place. I don't know what the option would be but the three priests and nun speaking like Americans seemed so out of place in the former Yugoslavia.
The events of Medugorje deserve and more loving and inspired telling.",1335398400,4,2800,4.5137795275590555

This movie only briefly shows the children that saw the apparitions of our Blessed Lady. It is mostly about the trials and tribulations that the pastor of the parish went through with the Communist Government. Martin Sheen should be commended for a great performance as the tortured pastor.  But since the title of the movie is the name that the people of that part of the world use to describe Mary, the Mother of Jesus, than why was it about the pastor and not about her appearances and about the children?

However he is quick to protect and defend the children from the authorities. He is arrested on the testimony of government agents planted in the congregation who twist his words to suit their purpose. The ensuing trial portrays the level of corruption in Yugoslavia at that time.
 Michael York is tremendous as the defence lawyer. Martin Sheen plays Fr. Jozo very well. Paul Guilfoyle gives a great performance as a communist official.
 The film gives an insight into the difficulty of living in truth in a communist or corrupt society. It takes place during the early days of the apparitions but is not an account of the apparitions.",1313884800,29,922,4.720496894409938
2827828,1,B000PPRCT2,"Do not buy this film if you are expecting it to be about the apparitions in Medjorgorje, or about pilgrimages of the faithful to this city, or even about the lives of the children- it contains very little of that.

It is political propaganda masquerading as a devotional film.  Most of the movie centered around the boring court case of Fr Jozo, and not around the Blessed Mother of God.  It should not have been titled ""Gospa"". Don't waste your money.",1308441600,12,452,4.555555555555555
2827829,2,B000PPRCT2,"I was so disappointed in this video I expected to learn more about the appearance of our lady and her message and its affect on the people, Instead this focused on the priest of the local parish and his troubles.  Where was our lady's message?  what happened with the Children? This was a typical cheap hollywood version and lacked all reverence to our lady.  I would not recommend it to anyone.",1302912000,15,395,4.535211267605634
2827830,4,B000PPRCT2,Gospa is a great account of the actual events which occured in Medjugorje in 1981.  Martin Sheen and Michael York are all great actors and contribute greatly to the film's presentation.  I visited Medjugorje some years ago and was dramatically effected by my visit.  I am purchasing the movie on dvd as the video has long worn out!  I encourage others to watch this film - a beautiful story of faith and grace.,1300838400,6,410,4.575342465753424

to recognize the Action of Actor Martin Sheen.  What an Actor who really personalized this caracter.
A 5 Star for me for both the Actor and the Movie itself.  True or not I still believe the Holy Mary.
It  is a beautiful story and even if it is just a movie...there's got to be something true in
this story and I did not to have be convinced for the reality of this story.",1296950400,24,470,3.978723404255319

2827835,1,B000PPRCT2,"I just wanted to bring up the issue that this apparition is actually what could be considered, in a negative state. There is no official approval from the church on this, plus, in the last two  years much has come out forbidding any priest from publicly advertising trips in bulletins and other parish material nor is the local bishop allowing visiting priests to say mass there I believe. When I found and read all this, I  personaly decided to stick with mother church and her wisdom on this and go with the wonderful and rich approved apparitions such as Lordes or Fatima. There is so much to them. Again, you may want to read the official church documents on this aparition as well as what the local bishop has written. I believe there are people, including those who received the visions, not being obedient to their local bishop. This is in stark contrast to Sr. Lucia who held the last secret of Fatima in her heart and told no one out of obedience. Just food for thought. I would also note, I have see this movie and will not unless the church gives an official approval.",1284940800,19,1079,4.5

2827837,3,B000PPRCT2,It was an interesting DVD which focused more on Fr Jozo. I would have liked to have seen more focus on the children as well as fr Jozo.but an interesting DVd .Worth watching especially for those who don't know the beginnings of the Medjugorje phenomena,1275868800,22,252,4.622222222222222
2827838,5,B000PPRCT2,"We took our family to see this movie at the theater many years ago. It has been a source of inspiration for our children who were in grammar school at the time. We now have a son who will be ordained a priest in 2011, and a daughter who credits her vocation to the contemplative religious life to Medjugorje. Our family has truly been blessed by Our Lady. I would highly recommend this film for family viewing. It may not win any Oscars but it could help save your soul. Blessed Mother is calling, ... ""are you listening?""",1270339200,,522,4.336734693877551
2827839,3,B000PPRCT2,This DVD depicted the situation on the early 80's but it seems as some of the opinions are still the same and suddenly the movie became actual again. I think this movie is interesting for those who are concerned in a way or another.,1257120000,2,232,4.295454545454546
2827840,1,B000PPRCT2,"Firstly, the quality of this DVD is very bad - looks like it was filmed from the TV. Secondly the movie itself is extremely slow to watch. We were very interested in the story it portrays, which is why we bought it, but didn't even finish the movie, it's that slow and uninteresting. Shame.",1252886400,14,290,4.388888888888889
2827841,4,B000PPRCT2,"This is a good telling of the beginning of the Medjugorge
apparitions from the perspective of the priest, Fr. Jozo.",1251676800,13,115,4.8
2827842,5,B000PPRCT2,"My wife and I went to Medjugorje the year which the film, Gospa, was released. My wife had a nasty bone spur in her heel and was not able to go up Apparition Hill or Cross Mountain. We attended a healing service conducted by Fr. Jozo. Fr. Jozo lay his hands on my wife's head. Although my wife is not an overly emotional person, she felt a warmth go through her body. After that she felt no pain in her heal. A subsequent x-ray showed no trace of the bone spur.

When we returned from Medjugorje, we went to a local theater for the opening of Gospa. We were turned away from the box office. We were told that the film caught fire in the projector! We bought the film when it came out on videotape. I am glad that it is now available on DVD.

Martin Sheen captures the spirit of Fr. Jozo. Michael York is terrific as the lawyer defending Fr. Jozo.

For anyone planning to go to Medjugorje, this film would be an good way to prepare. For anyone who has been to Medjugorje, this film would be a good way to relive the experience. For anyone curious about Medjugorje, this film would be a good way to find out about the place where the Greatest Lady on earth or in heaven is still appearing",1246838400,212,1186,4.192982456140351
2827843,5,B000PPRCT2,"Thanks to Martin Sheen for doing this movie about a supernatural event that everyone seems to be ignoring.
This movie adds valuable insight that when paired with books about Medjugorje presents a complete picture of God trying to reach His people in a way they will respond to.
Definitely worth purchasing and sharing with your friends.",1242518400,62,336,5.017857142857143

2827846,3,B000PPRCT2,"In telling the story of the Franciscan priest, Jozo Zovko, this film has great strengths but awkwardly mixes those with weaknesses.  The visions of the Virgin Mary by six young people in Yugoslavia is a captivating event that inspired millions all over the world.  Looking back at the first days and months from the perspective of Medjugorje's pastor requires the viewer to look beyond the performances of actors and watch through the eyes of faith.

As a viewer, it was awkward to listen to the variety of accents, American, British and Croatian, without feeling the film was amateurish.  As a pilgrim to Medjugorje, seeing the sacred places on film was one of its highlights.  Martin Sheen's portrayal of Fr. Jozo is excellent, but is a contrast to his other roles, like President Josiah Bartlett, and required me to look beyond the performance.

This is not for Medjugorje what the Song of Bernadette was for Lourdes, however it is a good introduction to the story for those who have never heard of this Bosnian village.  It allows deeper insight into the dangers that were faced between the religious leaders in preaching the gospel in the Communist-Socialist state that was Yugoslavia in the 1980's.",1221782400,81,1204,4.930693069306931

8192920,5,B000PPRCT2,I liked this movie. It is not necessarily centered on the children but Father Jozo. I have read the accounts of the visionaries and seen documentaries read and listened to books etc. in reference to them I purchased this one initially to learn more about all things Medjugorje however after reading another review I gathered this was more about Father Jozo and I also wanted to know more about him because he  was mentioned in the Medjugorje magazine. The editions that I have mention Father Jozo but there wasn't much information about him and I wanted to know more. You'll not see an apparition nor learn about the visionaries in depth. This story centers on and around Father Jozo 98% of the film and his part in the story. Someone I think mentioned the acting wasn't the best and this was also stated by the other viewer I watched it with. I thought the acting was fine.,1519603200,,874,4.56687898089172

8192922,5,B000PPRCT2,"I had just returned from a pilgrimage to Medjugorje. I actually found the DVD over there and purchased it.  But when I returned home and wanted to watch it there was nothing recorded on it. I like Martin Sheen, and decided to see if I could find it in the states.  I loved every moment of the movie because I knew it was true. The only thing I did not like was that it ended as it did.  I know the priest that this movie is about died on Cross Mountain but the movie cuts short, maybe due to the fact that it was made before his death",1517184000,,534,3.925925925925926

It is of course a very low budget movie, so most of the actors are not very good. However, it was good to see the church in the movie. The movie is really only about the priest's story, and not at all about all the incredible stories of the children visionaries.",1510876800,,429,4.308641975308642
