8236799,5,B00104AZ2I,"It comes down to Bob. These reviews are not going to make disciples or keep someone from feeling what they already do. When once asked how he would describe himself, he said that he was just a song and dance man. I believe that if a man gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between dies what he wants to do, that would be Bob.",1431907200,,344,3.859154929577465

8236801,5,B00104AZ2I,"Fans of Bob Dylan should really enjoy this show!  It is just like a VHS video tape in that there is no menu on the DVD and you have to fast-forward your way to a specific song if you don't want to watch the whole thing all the way through!  I really thought the sound was great and didn't really have any complaints about the video quality - it kinda has the same quality as some of the old 1970's TV shows on DVD...  ""MTV unplugged"" was much clearer though!  As far as the actual concert itself goes - it was GREAT!!!  Bob and his band was really rocking on this one!!  My favorites were ""I Shall Be Released"", ""Jokerman"", ""It Takes A Lot To Laugh"", ""Masters Of War"" and ""Don't Think Twice, It's All-Right"" - very cool!!!  A word of warning though.... there are a few camera shots of women with their tops off - especially towards the end - but then again it is a Woodstock revival so I guess that kind of thing should be expected!  LOL!!",1376870400,5,939,4.177777777777778

8236803,5,B00104AZ2I,A must see for  Bob and band put on a fine performance in this DVD. A two hour set with 12 songs. It is well done and worth seeing. The sound and video are of the 1990 quality for a live gig. All acceptable ..and enjoyed seeing this very good concert.,1370390400,3,251,3.9215686274509802
8236804,5,B00104AZ2I,"What a great show. If you like Bob Dylan, this is a must have. If you don't like Dylan, then why are you reading this???",1367539200,,120,3.84
8236805,3,B00104AZ2I,"I had to have it, since I am a major Bob fan.  The video and audio quality are not that great but it is a good set with cool tunes, and it is Bob Dylan.  Fans of Bob, get it.  Those that complain about sound and mention things like 5.1 surround, you will probably be disppointed...",1363564800,4,281,3.982142857142857
8236806,5,B00104AZ2I,"I'm glad I finally got this. I've already watched it three times. The quality is very good. The price, the ordering process and the shipping were all very good.",1326240000,2,160,4.551724137931035
8236807,4,B00104AZ2I,"Of the very few Dylan concerts officially available to the public, possibly the most well known is the unplugged set of 1994. Well, this DVD is filmed in that same year, with the same band, and offers a complete contrast. The performance is intense from start to finish in this 12 song set that is like a greatest hits for the MTV generation. The crowd is huge and the band rock for the occasion. The great musicianship on display here is a wonder to behold; JJ Jackson's brilliant rhythm and lead playing, Bucky Baxter's fluid pedal steel that seems to give it all magnificent shape and atmosphere. The acoustic set in the middle is truly beautiful, while 'Highway 61' (the track released on the Woodstock 94 CD) must be the most ferocious version ever. Gleaned from the professional coverage of the Woodstock event, there are plenty of great close-ups and not too many silly sweeping crowd shots. The sound quality misses a bit of high-end but is acceptable when played through a decent system. (not complaining, but when is this stuff ever going to come out in remastered form?)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-Woodstock-94/dp/B00104AZ2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At Woodstock 94</a>",1276041600,10,1227,5.329896907216495
