8546159,5,B00A2FI230,"This 2011 Dutch film about the final voyage of Willem Barents to find a route to Asia via the Arctic is a fabulous movie in every way. Having always had a love of exploration epics, I was ecstatic to see this relatively obscure chapter in that period had been given such lavish treatment. First of all, this Blu Ray WILL play on US players, I had no trouble. It's region A-B-C, which I think means it plays almost anywhere. The cast is solid and the characters are three-dimensional (like the movie, if you have that technology on your TV yet). The score is haunting, appropriate and beautiful. The drama (man-man, man-polar bear, man-nature) is gripping; the historical treatments seems reasonably good. And finally: Doutzen Kroes, a Dutch Victoria Secret model and actress, plays the love interest. I had never heard of her before, and I was instantly smitten. It's easy to see how the protagonist, her would-be lover young Gerrit, could keep pushing on through adversity to get home to a woman like her. The Blu Ray treatment is top notch and the English subtitles are both fluid and fluent. It's a shame that spectacles like this don't make it over to the US. This film has my highest recommendations.",1393459200,,1205,4.742857142857143

8546161,4,B00A2FI230,"The Age of Exploration (also called the Age of Discovery). Those 200 years (more or less) from 1450 to 1650, when a few brave men (yes, they were mostly men) coming from Western Europe, traveling in fragile wooden ships and armed with primitive fire weapons, basically conquered the world. It's strange that very few movies have been made out of that era. Perhaps this is so because this era is now a bit politically incorrect (since it many times involved Europeans invading and conquering Native people). But movies dealing with early polar exploration should not have such a problem, since there were few if any native people there. So here comes this fine film from the Netherlands that tells the true story of Willem Barents, the Dutch navigator that seeking a Northern route to China (Spain, being in war with the Netherlands at the time make it difficult for Dutch ships to go to the east through the Cape of Good Hope) reached in 1596 (more than three centuries before the North Pole was reached) the island of Nova Zembla in the High Arctic Sea, an island that is now a part of Russia. However, the ice soon broke the ship and the crew has to spend in the island a harrowing winter. Shot in 3D mostly in Iceland, this film is handsomely made, with a good, classic storytelling. The story is mostly told through the eyes of Gerrit de Veer, the young, inexperienced chronicler in the expedition. Famous Dutch model Doutzen Kroes has a small role, appearing mostly in flashbacks, as Gerrit's fianc back in Holland (she was obviously hired because she was believed to be a box office draw, not because her character was really needed in the story).",1357862400,2,1653,4.683848797250859
