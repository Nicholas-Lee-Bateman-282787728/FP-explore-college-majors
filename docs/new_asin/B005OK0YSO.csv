4852388,5,B005OK0YSO,"Awesome movie,even if it was cheesy. Clean movies back then. No they were not perfect, but they were clean. Every generation has it's good and bad movies. It was a shame seeing Patrick Swayze playing a bad guy or an arrogant mean spirited one, but every or most actors played a bad guy at their start. I hadn't seen Jamie Farr in many movies, but it was nice to see him in something different than Klinger .",1469664000,,407,4.298701298701299

4852399,4,B005OK0YSO,"A little bit hokey, definitely a period piece when the old timers got sidelined and staged a comeback in the 80's.  Being one of them I  Lived to Ride, and Ride to Live olde timers are gone now with the fruits and nutz running HD where everybody masquerades as an olde timer.  But speaking for those who went before ~ the real ones were had and shoulders, beards and all way beyond the weekend warriors of today!",1435881600,,412,4.324675324675325
4852400,2,B005OK0YSO,"Low Budget, only really decent part is seeing the actors together, only if you're bored.",1434412800,,88,4.933333333333334

4852415,4,B005OK0YSO,"RETURN OF THE REBELS stars Barbara Eden (VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, THE WOMAN HUNTER, VISIONS OF TERROR) as Mary Beth Allen, owner of a riverside campground business. After being hassled by a group of destructive, young party animals, led by KC (Patrick Swayze!),  Mary Beth begins pining for the days -20 years prior- when she was a biker chick. She looks up some old friends -including Jamie Farr!- and the Eagle Rock Rebels get back together for one more ride, in order to teach KC and his fellow boneheads some manners! As biker movies go, REBELS is very light-hearted and harmless. Don't expect the usual foul language, drugs, or violence. After all, these bikers are the good guys! Is it ridiculous? Of course! Still, it's a fun, silly romp! Besides, I'd watch Ms. Eden in just about anything!...",1388275200,6,808,4.7304964539007095
