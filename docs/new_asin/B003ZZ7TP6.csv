4237435,5,B003ZZ7TP6,"We purchased the NBC Western TV Legends which included the first episode of 4 TV series, this we found to be of very very good quality and gave us the chance to review the 4 TV shows, we have since purchased or ordered 3 of these sets due to being able to review each show, very satisfied with what we received.",1344297600,6,311,4.114754098360656

4237437,5,B003ZZ7TP6,"Sadly, they no longer make TV shows like these great NBC Westerns. Many thanks to Timeless Media for bringing these wonderful shows to DVD. I highly recommend these family friendly shows. If you like Westerns you will not be disappointed.",1311379200,10,238,4.975
4237438,3,B003ZZ7TP6,"This DVD has the opening programs of the TV shows mentioned on it's cover.  If you love these old shows, you'll love these opening editions.  I didn't watch these shows very much when I was a kid, so, my opinion is based more on the present than the past.  I found the acting and scripts to be mediocre.  I probably would not have bought this if I had known how mediocre they were.  But, hey, like I say, if you're a fan of these specific shows, you'll probably like this DVD.  The one benefit is that it does have just one show from each TV program.  You don't have to buy a whole series to discover whether you still like these shows from your childhood.",1310947200,9,656,4.2
4237439,5,B003ZZ7TP6,Always enjoyed Laramie and the other western shows.  This is the only DVD where you can see the pilot episode of Laramie in color.  My all-time favorite actor is Robert Fuller and it was great to see the pilot in color.  Great episodes from all these shows.  Great quality from Timeless Media.  Worth the price for any western fan.,1462838400,,331,4.5423728813559325
4237440,3,B003ZZ7TP6,"Having just watched the Virginian episode and not the other three yet, I was not happy with the picture and sound quality of the Virginian. It appeared to have been a 16mm copy with a noticeable splice at the beginning of the story. The color vacillated from scene to scene and had a definite red hue to it, The sound was rather muddy.
I previewed the other three episodes and they appeared to be in much better shape.",1461801600,,418,4.371794871794871

4237446,3,B003ZZ7TP6,"The shows are great, and the morals should be manditory for elementary students. Unfortunately the recording quality is very low.",1400198400,,129,5.5
4237447,5,B003ZZ7TP6,I was looking for the first episode of Laramie in color and it's in this DVD.  I also enjoyed the other first episodes and am considering getting more episodes of all 4 NBC westerns.,1396656000,4,182,4.352941176470588
4237448,4,B003ZZ7TP6,"Already owning all 4 seasons of Laramie....I was happy to find season 1, episode 1 in color.
Seasons 1 and 2 were in B&W....but this first episode was done in color....but not released until recently!
Laramie is still one of the best of the western series ever made!
It was a bonus receiving 3 other first episodes as well (although I already had THE VIRGINIAN!).",1392940800,3,363,4.6

8411407,5,B003ZZ7TP6,"I only watched the Laramie episode, Stage Stop, but I loved it.  The quality of the show is great, considering the age of the show.  Shipping time was fast.",1513555200,,156,4.344827586206897
8411408,5,B003ZZ7TP6,"Nice set of episodes.  Bought it mostly for the color version of Laramie.  Still could use some digital enhancement as was done by the network as the tv versions are very clear and crisp, but still nice to have.",1507766400,,211,4.384615384615385
8411409,3,B003ZZ7TP6,"I own the complete series, also by Timeless Media Group, whose shortcomings have been well documented by myself and other reviewers.  Their name is particularly apt for this DVD, because the episode of ""Laramie,"" in color, runs :01:44 shorter than on the First Season set.  It is not time-compressed.  For example, ""Andy Sherman"" answers a question from ""Bud Carlin"" that he doesn't even ask in this truncated version.  If I'd known, I would have kept searching for a non-TMG (if possible, given the NBC copyright) edition.  Am I too picky?  Oh, well, too bad.",1497398400,,560,4.904255319148936
8411410,5,B003ZZ7TP6,Bought this to get the color version of the first episode of 'Laramie' Love that show,1494979200,,85,4.375
8411411,3,B003ZZ7TP6,"I was definitely saddened when I got the DVD. I guess I did not read the description very well, there are only 4 examples of these four wonderful westerns of the 60's and early 70's.  My fault and I take full responsibility.",1481587200,,224,4.333333333333333

8411413,4,B003ZZ7TP6,"I found another cheaper listing of this same dvd purchasing that one.  Somehow I had gotten the idea from this listing that this was "" the first 4 episodes of each of these shows"" so I expected 4 Laramie, 4 Laredo etc.  I don't know if it was just me or that the way this is described here is easy to misread.  It is only 1 of each show  ; (
So far I've only watched Laramie,  I found it hard the understand several words in the show, a sound quality issue.  Some might complain about the visual quality also, but the difficult sound issue was my disappointment.  Otherwise you can't find the 1st color show for Laramie I've read",1474588800,,629,4.191666666666666
8411414,4,B003ZZ7TP6,Bought it for the Laramie episode.  Only way to be that episode in color.,1469664000,,73,4.214285714285714
