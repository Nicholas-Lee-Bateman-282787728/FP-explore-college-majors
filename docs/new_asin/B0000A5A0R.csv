7996075,5,B0000A5A0R,This was a gift for my brother who is a huge Beatles fan.  He said it is a very well done and enjoyable documentary.  This DVD was shipped promptly and arrived in excellent condition.,1401494400,,183,4.352941176470588
7996076,2,B0000A5A0R,"I only saw this at a friends house. This was a kind of fun DVD, but rather cheaply put together.

The thing is, their history is continually being stuffed down our throats. And they seem like the only classic band that Big Network Media will ""allow"" 2-hour prime time specials on them to this day. (""How dare we put the 'The Kids are Alright' in place of '8 Simple Rules' and 'Jim', leave that to VH-1...oh, The Beatles?....oh, OK""!)

As much as I love the Beatles, this DVD seems like another bandwagon-job. And no other classic band gets any contemporary spotlight for some reason. It's always these guys. McCartney's constant camera-hogging these days doesn't help much either, bless him.

Next, we'll be having documentaries on their favorite food.",1097107200,,752,4.859375
7996077,2,B0000A5A0R,"This isn't terrible most of the time, but over all it's not that interesting either. No new information, just all the same old stories anyone who's seen or read the Anthology already knows (and if you haven't, why aren't you buying those instead?) You get people saying things like ""I wasn't there, but I was told...blah blah blah."" Victor Spinetti's interview is the best part of this just because I hadn't seen him interviewed before.
The big question is, since most all of this evidently was recorded around the time George passed--why is this DVD just mono? I wouldn't expect 5.1 for this, but even interviews are done in stereo these days. There is a section with Tony Sheridan playing ""My Bonnie"" with his current band in the studio (for whatever reason) and that is even in over-modulated distorted mono!
If you have some extra Beatle cash, buy the 4 show Ed Sullivan set, or the ""Fun With the Fab Four / Unauthorized"" combo disc, or any number of other fringe titles that you will get more out of than this one. Then again, it's not nearly as bad as ""The Journey"", ""Lennon The Messenger"", or ""Big Beat Box"".",1066089600,20,1115,4.608040201005025
