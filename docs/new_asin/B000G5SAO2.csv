2600206,2,B000G5SAO2,"Mmmmhhh... Where should I start? I bought this dvd just to check the band with a drummer. I lost the trace of them a couple years ago.

After watching this dvd, I must say that even though many of the songs sound great with the rhythm of the drums, sometimes I felt like I was watching some kind of ""anniversary concert for something"" due to the sound of the celloes. Easily, You can use some of the tracks as a background music for a meeting with the family. Did they use some kind of synthesiser for a cello (I don't know if it exists :-)? They sound ""softer"" than they used to. In addittion to that, the sound of the drums in some of the songs, is unnecessarily higher that the celloes.

Someone said they had wild movements on stage, but on this dvd, this attitude not necessarily match with an agressive sound.

Pros:
The band performance is great! The setlist has their best shots.
Excelent audio and video quality.

Cons:
Too many cameras, but you barely can see the fingering of the boys.",1308009600,,996,4.396739130434782
2600207,4,B000G5SAO2,"I recently became introduced to Apocalyptica and became a die hard fan overnight. While they orignated as a Metallica tribute band, their style is completely original. It is amazing to see them perform, and I cannot wait to see them live. This DVD gave me a great view of their performance, but I could've used more backstage/tour footage. It is easy enough to become aquainted with their music on iTunes and YouTube, but this DVD gives us better camera angles and sound. Like I said, it would have been perfect with more than just 7 minutes of tour footage.",1301961600,,558,4.646464646464646
2600208,1,B000G5SAO2,"If you have heard Apocalyptica before, you won't be disappointed in the music.  Unfortunately, the video editing is so chaotic, with constant cuts, that you rarely get to actually watch the musicians play their music, which is the reason I bought the video in the first place.  It seems the company that made the video wanted to impress us with their fancy editing techniques.  Well I'm impressed.  But I didn't buy the video to see fancy editing.  I bought it so that I could get a close-up look at terrific musicians in action, watch their fingering, see their faces, see which guy is playing which part, and watch their incredible drummer.  I do give it one star though, because there is at least one song that is fairly well done that I have watched a couple of  times, and that I have shown to friends who were curious about Apocalyptica.",1252454400,5,843,4.58
2600209,5,B000G5SAO2,"...is absolutely amazing; well put together visually and DEFINITELY worth buying, whether you're a die-hard fan or completely new to Apocalyptica.
The camera crew really strive to capture everything that's going on, from the flying fingers, to the audience, and the interaction between the band members. You really get a sense of the intense energy and effort these guys put into their performance.
The performance itself is amazing, as are all of Apocalyptica's shows. From their punishing rendition of 'Inquisition Symphony' to the chilling 'Nothing Else Matters', you won't be able to tear your eyes away.
There's also some bonus material for those who are interested - a short (but nonetheless interesting) 'making of' for their song 'Repressed', and a selection of music videos featuring the various singers (including Lauri Ylnen from The Rasmus and Ville Valo from HIM.)",1251331200,,877,5.316546762589928
2600210,5,B000G5SAO2,"I have a biased opinion of this DVD because I am such a huge fan.  I love it, however if you want a high quality well produced huge arena show, this isn't it.  Again I will say though if you are a fan this is a must have.",1242086400,3,221,3.5833333333333335
2600211,5,B000G5SAO2,Amazing video!  Excellent quality!  Very nicely shot!  The music is more than great and the band plays so well live! I love APOCALYPTICA!  Definitely worth the money!  This is APOCALYPTICA's best DVD ever!,1222128000,6,205,5.090909090909091
2600212,1,B000G5SAO2,"Musically the band is excellent, but the production of this DVD sucks.
This concert was recorded with at least 100 cameras and a bunch of drunk cameraman, no one stays steady for more that 0.001 of a sec. impossible to watch.
This DVD is more the show of the camera controller than the performance of the band, I had to played it in the background while I was doing something else in order to don't get dizzy.
10 points for the band, and 1 point for the production and camera crew.",1209513600,11,481,4.2967032967032965
2600213,5,B000G5SAO2,"For anyone who does not appreciate hard metal music this DVD would be a disaster. However, for those who do, this DVD is absolutely superb. Nothing can be more unusual than to see and hear cellos play hard metal music. It is amazing how good that sounds. The wild movements made by the players only add to the high energy presentation. Every lover of hard metal music should have this DVD or any of the other Apocalyptica DVDs in their possession",1205107200,6,446,4.518518518518518
2600214,5,B000G5SAO2,"This is a band that formed in Helsinki back in 1996 as a side project for four Music students, and now has blossomed into a full time job, and millions of records sold worldwide.  I started following these guys when Metallica on Four Cellos was released, and it was very amusing in it's own part, but when their second release Inquisition Symphony came out, it was lightyears ahead in quality and depth.  It was their first album featuring original material, and was well worth the wait.  Now 3 albums after that, 2 live dvd's, 2 greatest hits releases, and a live CD, this is and awsome showcase of what the band has accomplished, where they came from, and a taste of the new.  Repressed is a new song for US consumers featuring Max Cavalera of Soulfly/Sepultura, and Matt Tuck of Bullet For My Valentine.  Hopefully their full catolog will be picked up by a us distributor, and their last few releases (apocalyptica, the best of apocalyptica, Amplified-a decade of reinventing the cello, and live (DVD)).  Pick this up, trash,industrial, hard rock, metal, death metal, black metal, and Goth fans will love this release

2600215,5,B000G5SAO2,"I have followed this band since their first major lable release of metallica on four cellos.  That was great in and of itself, but inquisition symphony, thier second release just blew that away by leaps and bounds, and had the beginnings of great original work.  Now 10 years later, and 500+ shows, many of them sold out, and millions of albums later, this and is still very fresh, and as loud as any of the thrash metal bands out there.  This video showcases an amazing display of endurance the way they speed through riffs that were originally played on guitar on a giant cello.  Apocalyptica is a showcase of excellence in musicianship, and features what should be featured, the music, and not a lot of words and vocals that can distract from awsome musicianship.  The show is around 90 minutes long, and just packed with thier best cuts.

  But wiat, there's more.  For those of you who just have to have lyrics, there are 8 videos, all of which have words sung by several well known artists from Guano Apes, Soulfly, Bullet for My Valentine, and HIM.  There is also the making of repressed, and a us tour mini documentary.  This is a must have for any apocalyptica fan, and a taste for us fans into what releases are to come in the future.

8128949,5,B000G5SAO2,"This is an amazing performance. I would recomend to anyone who loves heavy metal music with a surprisingly different approach. Four impressive cellos & a most energetic drummer performing original heavy metal as well as some cover tunes.
