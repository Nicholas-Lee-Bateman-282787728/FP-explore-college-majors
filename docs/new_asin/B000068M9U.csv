7964387,5,B000068M9U,"this is an awesome DVD, I mean who doesnt love to see the classic good vs evil theme with a twist of battling robots! It was awesome and I highly recomend it to those of you who like science fiction. If you are a follower of the medabots series, then this is for for you, and although I did enjoy volume 6 of medabots better, this was astounding! If you are not a follower of the series, then this is a very good DVD to start you off since its really one of the first to begin the rising action. once again, this is sweet! 5 out of 5 for shure!",1151452800,,544,3.90990990990991
