8045445,5,B00077BOJM,This movie is an absolute pleasure to watch. It's gut wrenching humor and romantic love story makes this movie a true American classic. easily on of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie.,1424217600,,227,4.428571428571429
8045446,5,B00077BOJM,"I don't know what the first reviewer (who sounds like a guy) was watching, but it wasn't this. I thought it was funny, charming, and engaging. The characters are perfect together and how fun it was to watch Margot Kidder in her role. I love it as much as I did when I first saw it in the early 80s and I notice something else every time I watch it. It's really hard to find now and IF you can find a copy, it's usually really expensive, but it is worth every penny. It's a keeper in my library!",1335916800,,494,4.0
8045447,1,B00077BOJM,"A Very dissapointing film-farce shot on the cheap in backdrop of beautiful Rome but the filmaker's never make use of the location's available to the movie.

Instead you have the borrish lead character 1 by 1 dumping his numerous female affairs, all of whom are more hysterical, melodramatic, dysfunctional & suicidal than he. Never do you feel even for a so-called romantic comedy any empathy for the 'Guy' in question who embark's on dumping them all with the film taking place for the majority of scenes in his apartment excluding more location. Karen Black appears although not for too long to mix-it up with mayhem at being unceremoniously dumped, but she's not stranger to weird fit's of instability.

Why? Indeed why? The 'Guy' want's to settle with the girl of his dreams ""Miss Right"" enter Margot Kidder(Superman) the fantasy woman he becomes obssessed with. Only after meeting her discovers that even true love doesn't run a smooth course and  when he realises she's not ""Miss Right"" he's back to the drawing boards of bachelor-hood.

The actors are wasted in this tripe of an unfunny slapstick of sorts comedy that look's quite dated to early 80s and dvd transfer is hardly remastered. Picture quality shows it's age and washed-out colors. What A Shame I thought this would be fun even in a silly John Waters/Polyester kind of way.  Look it's cheap enough to afford if your a fan of Margot Kidder & Karen Black looking good & youthful in their fame heyday-years. Nothing to else to recommend for this film at all unfortunately.",1119830400,5,1537,4.851145038167939
