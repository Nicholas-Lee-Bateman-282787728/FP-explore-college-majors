4961816,5,B00664ALK8,"It was great, as expected. Arrived on time and unused, as I expected also. Way to take care of my baby! LOl",1331769600,2,107,3.909090909090909
4961817,5,B00664ALK8,"This disc set covers a story arc that focuses on the theme of ""home is where someone thinks about you"" or ""as long as someone thinks about you, you have a place to return to"".  Naruto struggles over this advice, as he contemplates what if it is someone evil who thinks about you?  Is that still the place you should call home?  As usual, this arc is one where Naruto has an effect on other people to change them, or to bring to light the changes that are occurring.

The plot involves a lot of leaf characters, who are assigned various responsibilities.  Like sealing jutsu, recon, guarding, and rescue missions.  This also involves several new evil characters, plus scenes with the akatsuki, kabuto, and orochimaru. All centered around a boy with special powers and the three tails beast.",1330214400,6,789,4.681159420289855
4961818,5,B00664ALK8,"This is a tremendous box set! The action and story are great and the characters are some of my favorites...Kakashi, Shino, Hinata, Lee,TenTen etc. Guren is an interesting character also. I have every Naruto box set...and this one is one of the best if you like Naruto anime. I also read the manga and love it. This ""filler"" is just as good as anything I have seen from canon. Buy it on Amazon if you like Naruto!",1328227200,4,412,4.363636363636363

4961845,5,B00664ALK8,"Like the previous box set, it is a filler, but well-worth investment for anyone who loves the Naruto series. Most of the dialogue is classic Naruto--Super cheesy! But for some reason, it hits home every time. This is, by far, my favorite anime of all time!?",1402790400,,257,4.608695652173913

4961847,5,B00664ALK8,"Since this set finally reached an affordable amount I decided to buy it and set 8. I must say that for a filler arc it was enjoyable.
Plus it arrived in good time and in excellent condition. It was well worth the money.",1401840000,,219,4.116279069767442

4961850,5,B00664ALK8,I love everything Naruto its a great show/movie about a boy who refuses to let life and destiny control his life. If you haven't seen Naruto you must see it from the beginning.,1393545600,,176,4.363636363636363
4961851,5,B00664ALK8,A lot is revealed in Box Set 9. I just wish I didn't have to wait 3 months between each set. The set arrived super fast. Can't wait for Set 10.,1392681600,,143,3.6451612903225805
4961852,5,B00664ALK8,Watched the series with my son (who still is watching it in it's originally form and language) when he was young and now he's a young man. Trying to catch up to him in the story arcs.,1391731200,,183,3.972972972972973
4961853,5,B00664ALK8,Another wonderful addition to the Naruto series. I recommend it for all Naruto fans and I'm looking forward to the box sets that come after it.,1384041600,,143,4.538461538461538
4961854,5,B00664ALK8,I love this show a lot therefore I am only giving the show five stars. However I am very upset with the carrier goHastings. I have always gotten my DVDs from Amazon in no more than two days however with goHastings it has been a week and I still have not gotten them. I would not suggest goHastings if you are anxiously awaiting to see the show. Naruto Shippuden = two thumbs up. goHastings = two thumbs down!,1380067200,,408,4.243589743589744
4961855,5,B00664ALK8,Exactly what it was supposed to be.  Naruto shippuden is a very good series.  Very few anime's are good its good I got one of them.,1375747200,,131,4.0
4961856,5,B00664ALK8,"Great story. I love when anime progress stories like this. The original naruto series was well written. Each character was interesting. Alot of touching moments. Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

4961858,5,B00664ALK8,Great series. I brought most of them on black friday. Starting from season 1 -12 and it way better than when he was a kid. I don't know why I haven't seen it sooner.,1360713600,,165,3.8823529411764706

4961862,5,B00664ALK8,"Everybody's got to love Naruto. Whether you're a fan of the anime, manga, or the merchandise, Naruto Shippuden is definently a great part of a great saga. A not-in-the-manga ark is taken in order to show more of Naruto's personality and heart and to show some more kick-butt fight scenes that are as worthy as any other. I've already gone through the entire series waiting and wanting more, and this set continues that awesome charisma that keeps me hooked to the series.",1357084800,,471,4.7560975609756095
4961863,5,B00664ALK8,best show ever action and funny seeing naruto grow as a stronger ninja to save his friends and to become Hokage watching him achive his goals can't wait to see what happen next just wish the english version came out fast on DVD,1347840000,,227,4.3023255813953485

4961865,5,B00664ALK8,This was one of the best of Naruto Shippuden Box set that i have seen and i have watch alll of the box sets with my Grandchildren.  Power packed and entertaining.,1341273600,,162,4.225806451612903
4961866,5,B00664ALK8,Naruto Shippuden Box Set 9 was great!  Absolutely amazing and I love it.  A must have for any true Naruto fan!,1340150400,2,110,4.190476190476191
4961867,2,B00664ALK8,"With Naruto box sets costing as much as they do for as few episodes as you get, forgo buying this filler arc.  Rent it first or watch it online THEN make up your mind as to whether or not you want to buy it.  In my opinion, this arc is not necessary and not as good as the main story line.  Sure, it is hands down the best filler arc to date for the series (in my opinion) and they even throw in some funny stuff regarding Tobi and Deidara.  Plus the arc does neatly tie in to the real story line.  But ultimately, the main story stuff is very minimal and you will not miss anything by skipping this set.  I will never own this set... but I am so buying the next one!  Back to the main story line!!!",1339372800,,699,3.9148936170212765
4961868,4,B00664ALK8,"The three-tails arc is an original in many ways in anime. It is the only anime I know of that if cannon and filler at the same time. It is pretty much an extended part of the story. At times it has that filler feeling but at most times it feels like you are watching cannon.

I recommend this box set to any fan.",1334707200,4,312,3.875
8493717,5,B00664ALK8,Decent story im buying because hulu has dubbed up to episode 97. THIS IS ENGLISH DUBBED and subtitled so don't worry,1507075200,,116,4.571428571428571
8493718,4,B00664ALK8,"This is the continuation of the Guren/Yukimaru arc. Its okay but not as good as the main akatsuki story line. Guren finally comes around and you grow to like her a bit. The three tails continues to run amok which is cool. Kabuto continues his despicable ways. The 3 underlings of Renji/Kabuto are okay but not too cool. Its kind of neat when they combine at the end and Sai says ""This must be what they refer to as ""gross"""". Honestly probably my favorite character in this arc is Gamakitchi - yea that's right the less than intelligent toad who likes snacks. Really he just cracks me up. The English voice for him was done well and adds to the humor he provides. I'm looking forward to the next set where Sasuke rebels against Orochimaru. That's a sweet encounter.",1499558400,,764,4.503597122302159
