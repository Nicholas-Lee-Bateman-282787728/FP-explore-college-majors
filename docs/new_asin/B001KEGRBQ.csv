3665231,5,B001KEGRBQ,"I saw the movie last summer during it's limited release. It is a great movie, with a lot of heart and soul. The story is interesting and touching; the acting is top-notch.
If you didn't think that Jesse McCartney could act, this will change your mind. The range of emotions this guy can show is amazing.
Highly recommended.",1233360000,3,323,4.586206896551724

3665251,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Keith  My Take On This Film

Keith is a film about two seniors in high school  Natalie is Miss Everything and apparently destined to go to Duke. Keith is the underachiever who loves his truck. They end up as partners in chemistry class and Keith's secret within a secret begins to unfold.

Through this period, Natalie leads a kind of double life  hanging out with the beautiful crowd and having a handsome boyfriend runs alongside pulling pranks, but learning about life with Keith. We see the romance there coming even though Natalie is in denial. Nevertheless, she views her life from the other side and some things start to dawn on her. She begins to care less about perfect grades and her tennis matches and more about Keith.

All this might seem like a teen romance flick, but it's much more. The reason it's more is the inner secret, which is hinted at in the beginning of the movie but not totally revealed until the end. I'm not going to play the spoiler here, so you need to watch this entertaining, fun and touching film to find out what it is.

Not quite a coming of age film, Keith is about two people from different backgrounds who are experiencing life in a radically different fashion and a critical time in their lives. Nevertheless, they find each other and a lot happens. This film has captured my imagination more than any other film since For Love Of The Game. I have watched it several times and each time it moves me more and provides a window into my own soul. I highly recommend it.",1471996800,,1507,4.498168498168498

It takes you through the a journey of two teenagers in love and the trials they face. I have fallen in love with this movie time and time again.

3665281,5,B001KEGRBQ,"This movie is so powerful because it's not just about true love between two people. It's about transformation. It's about realizing that we live in such a narrow-minded materialistic social and political world where we focus so much on text book knowledge, where we get our educations from, money, and misjudging everyone's intentions instead of seeing life for what it really is: opportunities and paying attention to everyone around you...not just the people you know. Life really is too short, live it with meaning and live it the way you want to live it....not in the shadows of someone else's thoughts or dreams. including society's. Your life is your life...do what you feel is right and let people in that you feel deserve a chance even if others think you're crazy. This is not a high school movie...this is a lesson about life and how love conquers all. ",1445040000,,863,4.831081081081081

3665283,5,B001KEGRBQ,"My favorite movie. I love the humor and how they ended it, a great way for such a tragic situation.
I thought the acting was very good and believable and when you watch it the second time you have a different feeling towards the characters. I don't recommend reading the book first for this movie, Hotel Eden (with the short story Keith written by Ron Carlson) it will ruin the ending. They did  a great job of continuing and adding to Mr Carlson's story.",1439424000,,455,4.416666666666667

3665299,5,B001KEGRBQ,"This movie speaks to my heart.
When we were 20 year old, my boyfriend at that time was diagnosed with germ cell cancer. Things were complicated. In short, my biggest regret in my entire life was that I, being immature, obsessed, selfish and terrified at that time, failed making him happy.
Keith and the boyfriend, both brilliant, had completely different personalities; but I can see traces of him in common with Keith--the way they were fighting to cope with their fate--which is hard to describe in words. McCartney did an impeccable job portraying vividly this teenager who was mentally restless and emotionally struggling. I also love Harnois' character, Natalie. From the beginning, she always spoke neutrally or positively of Keith in front of others. In her evaluation system, Raff was the ""right"" one but she tried not to disappoint Keith as a friend. None of the characters actually changed inside; it was the cross section of their lives together with who they were made things happen. Thus the story is more real. The dialogues are sleek yet honest. What draws me the most is at the end--""at this rate I won't even make it to London, Ontario"" and ""I just wanted a little more time"", so damn true. If you calculate the time, Keith lived at most a month after the goodbye scene. It is so heart breaking for me to see Natalie by herself. It's like a mirror. I never walk out of that shadow myself and can't help wonder if she would. Do people like me and Natalie prefer to never having encountered our Keith? I don't even know. ---sorry for the verbosity, this is my first movie review.",1435536000,3,1595,4.679715302491103

This movie shows that though young, high schoolers are not exempt from the deeper, and sometimes darker, thoughts and experiences in life. This is not the average love story. There is a lot of messed up stuff that isn't romantic. But, in the end, it's real and it's raw. I truly enjoyed this film. 5 stars!",1406851200,,452,4.524390243902439

The acting was actually really professional, and the last scene will remain on my top list, watch it and you'll see what I mean. Keith is filled with relatable teen issues that's why I loved it. This isn't your average early 2000s movie that are clichd from start to finish, this movie is deep and moving and you can't help but think what it'd be like if you decided to not plan ahead of your life and just drive forward in the vast road ahead.",1406505600,,596,4.283185840707965

3665343,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Wow. That's all I can say. I love movies...watch them all the time. Some are good, some are great, but this movie, this story, is guaranteed to touch those of you who live life on another level....the deeper level. That, for me, is the difference between a movie and a story that is not only unforgettable, but a life event that helps me to define who I am and why I'm here. Like someone already posted, I could address the great acting, the awesome story line and that it's a movie about teens, but please, don't watch it because of those things. Watch this story because you aren't afraid of the answers to the questions of who you are and why you're here. No, this story isn't about religion. It's about what life really is - the deeper level that almost everyone ignores and doesn't want to talk about. And at the end, if there are no words to describe how it makes you feel, and you still want more, watch it again. I promise, you won't be disappointed.",1406160000,,958,4.35754189944134
3665344,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Seriously an amazing movie. It's not one of those silly, giddy, light-hearted movie; it's serious, touching, sad, and inspirational. That's the beauty of this movie. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from it, but it blew me away.
Most movies are so far-off from real life that it can leave you feeling just empty and day-dreaming at the end, but ""Keith"" was realistic, leaving me with something that I can carry on into my life. Not to mention, I love how Jesse didn't even try to cover up his imperfect skin... Another exhibition of the down-to-earth trait of this movie.
Disregarding the typical Hollywood scenes, this movie is different and that's what I love about it. It's not fake nor covered up, sweetened nor facetious, pretentious nor insincere.
Not everyone may like ""Keith""... In fact, I don't think a lot of people will. But if you're into something different from the typical movies, touching rather than vulgar, Keith is the movie for you!

I didn't believe in the relationships that were formed - things seemed to happen without much development or believable development.

This message is delivered in the last 20 minutes of the movie as the hidden plot is unveiled.  Keith is kind of creepy until you understand all what is going on.  Then it is very touching when you understand that he is a scared kid trying to come to terms with his fears.  His decision to embrace life at the end was courageous.  The easier route--which was the one he was on before meeting her-- would have been to just give up living at all.",1390608000,,568,4.035714285714286

(Maybe that was the plan with the delayed-release) The movie is obviously geared to younger folks, but I enjoyed it myself, as I watched it with a half-dozen teenagers. It has a few surprises, and the acting is solid. It makes me wonder why Jesse didn't do more acting back then. Anyway, give it a whirl, if you are tempted.",1388361600,,460,4.2988505747126435

The poster on the cover wasn't inviting but I did it anyway. I didn' t understand it or get anything in it besides the content is bad for a young girl to mess up her future and life, lose a scholarship, cheating on a boyfriend who completely trusted her with her lab partner is wrong, and that s the wrong message to send to young people. Life isn't a game, trying to be impredictable and all that kind of nonsense was wrong and just stupid but it s okay to fall in love but just do it the right way.",1383696000,,630,4.088709677419355

3665411,5,B001KEGRBQ,"I hated Keith the boy, but I liked Keith the film.

Natalie (Elisabeth Harnois) is a beautiful, talented achiever on the fast track to a Duke tennis scholarship. As a high school senior she dates Rafael, a handsome South American exchange/transfer student (Ignacio Serricchio), and seems to have a happy life.

Her chemistry lab partner is Keith (Jesse McCartney), an intelligent, self absorbed, egotistical teen with a really bad attitude. McCartney acted the part well, because he made me intensely dislike the character. Keith is constantly playing with Natalie's mind but--wouldn't you know it--she falls for him.

With 16 minutes to go, we find that Keith has terminal cancer and has been secretly taking chemo. In an intense confrontation at the airport in which Keith is about to board a plane to places unknown, he admits he at first hated Natalie for her perfect life while his is so bad, but grew attached to her; he once again tries to break it off with her. She reminds him that she loves him and is committed to him. They kiss goodbye passionately.

Segue to ""later"", Keith apparently dies because the final scenes show Natalie fixing up his truck and driving it to a car show that Keith wanted to go to in London, Ontario...by herself.

Elisabeth Harnois shows star potential and gives the best performance; there's good acting in the supporting roles, too. No nudity, no sex, a few kisses, no drugs, some mild cursing. This film is basically a rocky love story that exasperates you but keeps you interested throughout. A better than average film.",1380326400,,1561,4.875471698113207
3665412,4,B001KEGRBQ,"Sometimes a story drifts from the Hollywood norm and actually tells a unique story that is really universal - about transformation, understanding and acceptance - without being overly preachy or corny. This is one of those rare films.  The cast makes it happen because they are not famous teen actors or superstars - but just great actors in these roles. I credit the casting agents and director for selecting them, and they make the film move into another dimension - that of a serious film posing as a teen drama.  It's just great entertainment but well written and with respect to the story. It carries a lot of messages and meanings and yet, as an audience member of any age, sexual orientation or political stance - says its important to be open to people different than yourself and to make your own judgements about people. This is particularly important when reaching young adults and this film caters to their world and respects it.  I also love the musical choices here and moments where the filmmaker leaves it open for the audience to grow and understand. It's one of my favorite films in this genre.",1379030400,,1112,4.721649484536083
3665413,5,B001KEGRBQ,I love the dialogue in this movie. The capacity of imagination both main characters exhibit makes you continue to watch. Overall a well made movie with exceptional actors bringing the chemistry alive on film.,1379030400,,208,5.147058823529412

3665415,2,B001KEGRBQ,Don't waste your time. I watched this because of the high reviews. One of the weirdest movies I've ever watched:(,1378771200,,113,4.7
3665416,1,B001KEGRBQ,"For about five minutes, this movie was interesting - dangling the prospect of a malevolent, predatory teen going after teen queen with psy-ops. However, his seduction of her plays out for the next 75 minutes as a straight forward feel-good plot where loveable outsider-wierdo woos the girl right off her pedastal and into ""real"" life. The sound track is so heavy - handed, it forces this one-dimensional, positive feel to this courtship wish should feel subtle, unsafe, dangerous, unpredictable and uncanny. Instead, its an after-school special with all characters directly off-the-rack.  This is hugely a problem with the directing - what's-his'face doesn't know how to deliver this mood. If he did, I'd bother to know his name. Kieth is one-dimensional, always and ever the up-beat iconoclastic smirking good naturedly at the hijinks he has planned. I heart Nietzsche. An acting note or two from What's his face would have gone a long way towards promoting an alternative facial expression. There may have been an imntersting movie in here somewhere but apart from the first and last five minutes - its a sad afternoon on network television. Does it deserve one star?  No. Probably 2 - but I have to bring down the INSANE over-rating that snared me into showing this film on my Saturday Night Film fest, based on the lunacy of its rating. Do not get sucked in.  This is mediocre.  If you want edgy teens try We Need to Talk About Kevin, if you want funny mixed in your dark - try Election. But steer clear here.",1377993600,2,1513,4.8301158301158305
3665417,1,B001KEGRBQ,"I don't like the fact that in the middle of the movie it looks as though someone had taped over a portion of the movie. Also, the clarity and quality of that section of the movie is horrible. However, the remainder of the movie was okay.",1377993600,,237,4.173913043478261

3665420,5,B001KEGRBQ,I have watched this movie a few times.  It always makes me bawl hysterically but I love the message of the movie.  It makes you realize that life is short and you need to live each day and not put so much worry into your future.,1376352000,,228,3.9347826086956523

There is only one maybe 5 sec. sexual content scene, some cussing, but other than that, such a great flick! I would compare it to Twilight (without the sci fi stuff), My Girl, and the classic 80's movie Say Anything. Grab a tissue!",1375315200,,308,4.237288135593221
3665422,5,B001KEGRBQ,"I don't normally watch love stories, especially with teenagers involved.  Teenagers tend to not feel the depth of feeling (in movies mostly) that can last a lifetime.  Seeing it on screen is obvious it's acting.  However, I thought I would give this movie a shot because a love story sounded good, and one I hadn't seen yet.  After watching this movie and laughing and crying as well as shaking my head at the antics of the two main characters, I must say it was a amazingly good movie.

I don't normally cry but this movie definitely brought on tears.  You could just feel the passion in the characters at the end of the movie, even though they were young.  You could tell there was something there.

I definitely recommend!!  Haven't seen anything to even compare with this one since A Walk to Remember.  And hey look at that, there is similarities in the two movies.",1375315200,,869,4.548387096774194

At first it feels a bit bizarre, especially with Keith's attitude and behavior.. i must admit i did not know how to feel about him at first. Stalker much? But as the character development continued i found myself growing more and more hopelessly in love with these characters.  The acting was fantastic and the emotions were portrayed so well that whenever someone cried or laughed, i found myself doing it right along with them.

This movie is so incredibly sweet, give it a chance, i guarantee you'll love it!!",1374796800,,702,4.4765625

At first there was no indication in the movie that this was the problem but at the end of the story it revealed his unfortunate situation.  Some would catagorize this as a romantic story, but I personally say that this is real life story that it not gloss over with a happy ending like so many movies protray today.",1374019200,,418,4.346153846153846

3665430,2,B001KEGRBQ,"This movie lacks a proper reflection of reality in a bad way. There are so many things that are unrealistic and therefore disconnected from what would really attract me or draw me into this movie.  Keith apparently has cancer and yet is never portrayed as being sick in the manner consistent with the disease.  Keith treats Natalie horribly yet Natalie still remains with him.  Anyone with real intelligence would've left him an instant, or at least maintain a healthy distance.  The reason for her attraction to Keith is never made clear.
Another very poor element of this movie is the acceptance or sympathy of someone choosing despair.  The opportunity to portray any heroic virtue seems to have been lost in a soup of empathy without a cause.  Move along people, nothing to see here.",1373155200,,787,4.835820895522388

If anyone else has seen those descriptions they are not part of the movie (unless they were edited out of this version)...The only concern I would have is the influence this movie might have on a young lady to try to ""rescue"" someone as troubled as Keith in a real situation & end up getting manipulated.  I do not say that out of disrespect for the character portrayed but because it could turn out much darker in real life. I think it is more than an emotional teen could handle even if they did all they could. I think this movie hits home by showing that you will NOT be able to rescue others but you can still BE THERE as they go through.

3665453,5,B001KEGRBQ,"""Keith"" is a movie that will both tear and warm your heart.  Sometimes, it is tearing your heart.  Sometimes, it is warming it like a gentle, cozy fire.  And there are moments when the movie is doing both.  That is the depth, complexity, and emotional range that this movie has.

The film is a story about two young high school students who ""happen"" to be partnered up in their Chemistry class.  Natalie, who is beautifully played by Elisabeth Harnois with incredible depth, is a girl who seems to have everything going for her.  She's beautiful, popular, smart (as she is on the verge of possibly getting a scholarship to Duke University), talented (as a writer/editor of the yearbook as well as one of the top ranked tennis players), and sweet.  She initially has eyes for Raff, the handsome young South American guy whom she sees at ""The Brick"" which is the local teenage hangout spot near a lake.  Everything is firing on all cylinders for Natalie.  Everything is in place, and nothing can go wrong.

Enter Keith (wonderfully played with equal depth by Jesse McCartney), who is a somewhat strange young guy, who ends up as her lab partner.  He is known around campus as the quirky, odd ""loser"" whom nobody pays any real attention to.  He doesn't seem particularly interested in many things; at least not in school or anything conventional.  At first, Natalie is upset about his lackadaisical approach to studying and doing his share of the lab work.  After all, she has a GPA to maintain, and the class is an AP course.  So, how in the world can this partnership possibly work?  They seem as polarized as two people can be.

Natalie is someone who is methodical and has everything in her life planned out.  Keith doesn't seem to have anything planned at all, and he is very much a person who flies by the seat of his pants.  This is more than just a little strange to Natalie, at first, but she soon finds herself stepping bit by bit outside of her comfort zone.  One of their first excursions is to go ""bowling.""  Interestingly, the ""bowling"" isn't what Natalie or even the audience has in mind, and you can't help but laugh and enjoy the ideas that Keith comes up with.

Keith is a person with tremendous charm, and he really doesn't seem to care what other people think of him. These are elements, despite their differing characteristics and views, that begin to attract Natalie.  But, alas, not everything is as it seems. Is there a reason why Keith is the way he is?  It is a mystery to Natalie as well,and she becomes almost obsessed to find out what it is as she realizes that this quirky kid, who started out as a lab partner, then a hangout pal, now means something much more to her.  In short, he takes her cozy world and turns it upside down.  What truly matters in life?  What is really important?  These are issues and questions that Natalie is forced to deal with.

None of the characters fit into any typical stereotype.  I am glad that writers can still come up with interesting and exciting characters (especially teens) who don't fit the mold that has been done to death in so many other teen films, and in many ways, it really helps to make this film work.

The dialogue is fresh, crisp, and full of whit.  McCartney, especially, is able to make the most out of his lines with a clever smirk that seems to always be present on his face.

This is an incredibly powerful film that will tug at your heart.  The two lead actors are simply immaculate in their performances.  They know their characters inside and out, and both tear down all of the walls and boundaries to take the viewer on a deep and complex ride into the psyche and heart of both characters.  This is not an easy thing to do, and I genuinely can't think of any two other actors who could have pulled it off better.  McCartney and Harnois have a chemistry that works well, despite the 8-year age gap between them (Harnois being the elder of the two).

It is a true rarity that two characters bring so much to the table in a story that dares them to do just that.  We see two people who  are forced to peel back the layers of fear that everyone feels, especially given the story here, and what we have left is what should be left:  love.  But, is it enough?  Watch this amazing movie, and find out.  And perhaps you will discover that, despite so many bad movies that are churned out nowadays (especially teen films), there are still little gems, like this film, that fall through the cracks.  Thank God for that!

If this moving film doesn't leave an indelibly, poignant footprint on your heart, then you might want to check to see if you still have a pulse.",1367884800,3,4644,4.480333730631704

The rich girl and the poor boy hookup and a surprise comes after she assumes as many people do no matter what age what is different about Keith.  The real truth comes out towards the end of the movie and shows us that true love can happen at any age and to anyone if you are honest and truly care about one another.  This movie was perfect showing that not always does a girl or woman want the popular good looking fellow. She may very much be better off with the poor young man and happy, as money and good looks do not buy love.  Love comes from within and with two people who are totally devoted to one another forever.

Starring Jennifer Westfeldt and Adam Scott they both have a great future in acting as I laughed, cried and total enjoyed what they did with the roles they played.  They were believable in the roles and that is what makes a good actress and actor, period...

Directed by Jennifer Westfeldt she did a great job of bringing this movie to life with the all the actors in the movie and especially new what to do with the story to make it totally believable to the audience watching this movie. Bravo Ms. Jennifer Westfeldt you will go far with directing, if you keep making movies like this one.

This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. But it's certainly boring, depressing, and full of static characters. The movie tries to be really ""deep"" but fails miserably.

Here are just a few issues that make this movie a waste of time:

There appears to be a 10 year age difference between McCartney and the lead actress, who I'm pretty sure has been playing high school students for about 15 years now. She should probably move on.

I have seen this whole cancer story about a thousand times now. Most of them through Nicolas Sparks. As predictable and cliched as Sparks stories are now, I have to say that they do a much better job than this movie, which tries to take a unique approach by making the situation seem as hopeless as possible, especially for those left behind. In this, it succeeds.

Finally, there is no actual resolution to the story. Keith dies and the girl is just left depressed and lost. If you want to be left feeling the same (in addition to having lost two hours of your life), I'd say go for it.",1362960000,2,1172,4.437209302325582

The film is about the ability to choose what path your life takes and to appreciate the fact that you have a choice. I honestly didn't think this film would be very good, but Jesse McCartney was terrific in Summerland, so I decided to check it out. Jesse, you need to realize it's time to ditch the s***ty pop songs and stick to acting, because you were truly great as Keith. Elisabeth Harnois was also very good as Natalie, and as I watched the movie, I realized I was feeling what her character was feeling, the textbook sign of an amazing performance.

Keith is a mysterious teenage boy whose one concrete goal is to ""have fun"" with a beautiful, popular and seemingly perfect girl named Natalie.  Natalie can't seem to figure him out.  On one hand, he's fun and she loves being with him and on the other, she knows there is something wrong with him; is he crazy or is it something else altogether?  She slowly unravels the mystery that is Keith and even though she tries to keep him at a distance, she can't seem to stay away.

This movie was beautifully acted and I was very impressed with both lead actors.  They had great chemistry and gave powerful, emotional and believable performances.  There was so much love, desperation and longing in just a kiss.  Jesse McCartney, in particular, is incredibly talented.  He shows so much emotion and feeling with just a look.

3665487,5,B001KEGRBQ,"It is true that the ending was foreshadowed and predictable but, that did not detract from the depth of the performance. What I liked most about this film was the emphasis on how empty the girl's life really was as she strove to this formulaic prescription of success dictated to her by a combination of her parents' unmet ambitions and also a school system that encourages such empty living. I thought the choice of college was really just a wonderful complement for the vacuous nature of her existence prior to Keith :)

But more than anything, the best part about this film is the acting of Keith - it is very believable, spot on, and heart-rending. It illustrates the ideal, what we are all looking for in a relationship: someone who can make light of our deepest frustrations, someone who completely understands us, and someone who can bring us to a deeper level of spiritual awareness and appreciation for the brevity that is life.

I was really surprised that Jesse McCartney was able to deliver this level of performance; I initially thought this was going to be a mindless teenage movie and was only watching it to amuse myself as to what I felt certain would be the cultural degradation over the years of teenage films. Instead, I was shocked.

The only unbelievable aspect to this whole film is that the girl would have taken any interest in the dumb jock that is supposed to be her boyfriend; there's nothing really wrong with him but - that's the only thing that kind of detracted from the film; of course she matures out of it but - you've got to wonder at a man who would stick around so indefatigably for a woman that isn't entirely faithful.

The cinematography was great; my favorite scenes were those where they were watching the bonfire where the teenagers congregated; initially the boy watches alone in the dark, far removed from the life before him - but as the movie progresses the girl joins him there; ultimately she does not stay there, although the experience nearly engulfs her. She emerges triumphant, no longer a slave to the hedonism and obsessive compulsiveness that was formerly her life, but more mature, self-aware, and yet - to a certain extent lost.

The movie leaves us with a question mark as to how she will grow from the experience, but we are assured it is for the better, tennis matches aside.

3665493,4,B001KEGRBQ,"This film is, I think, about how time doesn't work out for everyone. These two people find each other at what would be the beginning of life for most people but it is the end for one. Love isn't always pretty or wonderful or even long lasting, but it is love & you have to make the best of it.  Yes, the male lead can be a real smuck & he's treating the young lady badly, but he's also like Petrucio in The Taming Of The Shrew, engaging in a game he can neither win nor see the finish of. And this young lady has strength that even she isn't aware of & her opposite does bring it out of her.  The two leads have very good chemistry, which does work in spite of the tough plot twists that put both of them through their respective hell.

3665507,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Wow! This movie is very unrealistic but by showing extremes it makes a very strong point. Differently than ""A Walk to Remember"", this movie does not mention religion a single time. Keith is NOT a likable character in the TRADITIONAL sense of the world (not a typo for word). But ""somehow"" the girl falls hard for him. I was laughing the whole time. I would not recommend this movie for teens. It is disturbing because it shows a point of view that a teenager has no way of grasping. It is like teaching advanced math to a 6-year old. Somehow this movie reminds me of ""Revolutionary Road"", another disturbing movie that I would not recommend to a married couple. At the end I got this feeling: OMG, this Keith guy was completely nuts. He had nothing to lose. He was very insensitive and selfish throughout the movie, not caring about a damn thing, disrupting the girl's life like a hurricane, but when she finally tells him that she can't stop thinking about him, he weeps without facing her. ""Anyways, the stakes are too high for mere mortals who are not dying soon, so this movie should not be taken seriously"". It is about love but also about power, one that has nothing to do with money, politics, prestige or career. Watch at your own risk.",1344124800,3,1244,4.533333333333333
3665508,5,B001KEGRBQ,One of the Best Movie I've ever seen. Very touching. Phenomenal performance. This is definitely one of my top 3!,1343952000,,112,4.65
3665509,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Keith is one of my favorite films. Yes, it is sad. I'm surprised by how many reviewers were put off by the fact that this movie isn't a particularly happy one. I urge those who intend to watch Keith to consider this before viewing the film. Essentially, if you are expecting a happy romance with two perfect characters, this is the wrong movie for you.

A lot of reviewers also seem put off by the character of Keith himself. I urge new viewers to try to understand Keith's attitude and to see how he positively affects Natalie (and vice versa) before making judgments about him. Keith often comes across as a jerk whose sole intention is to ruin the life of an honor student who is doing pretty well for herself. In many ways, he does just that. Here's what you have to remember: Keith is jealous of Natalie and the opportunities she has (""Is Duke fair? Is Europe fair?"") I hardly think Keith's intentions are really to hurt Natalie, but he does have some level of bitterness toward her. Again, do not expect perfect characters: Keith is realistically flawed.

Also, while Keith's actions may have hurt Natalie to a degree, he also reminds her of the importance of living life for happiness in my opinion. Others may disagree, but I feel that Keith taught Natalie to take life a little less seriously and maybe she did the opposite for him. The two are certainly opposites, but that's why they work so well together - they are able to change each other for the better.

As for the acting, Jesse McCartney shines as Keith. I'm truly impressed by his acting here. You can see the conflicting emotions he feels during the entire film through his facial expressions, which makes me empathize and appreciate Keith's point of view more. I like Elisabeth Harnois as well, but I think I've actually preferred her in less serious roles than this one and I think she shines most during the more humorous scenes in Keith. Most of the other characters in the film are likable. I was not particularly off-put by any of them.

I recommend Keith to those who want to see something other than the run-of-the-mill romance, but who still appreciate romance for what it is. If you appreciate interesting characters who exhibit realistic flaws, this movie's for you. There are certainly plenty of giggle-worthy moments in Keith, but it should not be regarded as a comedy so do not take it as such. Enjoy! :)",1343260800,8,2388,4.625

I ened up watching this movie on tv, I hadn't ever seen a trailer for it or even heard of it before until it came on that night. I think that's what made the movie better, the fact that I didn't know what it was about or I didn't know what was going to happen next. But, I'm glad I watched it. Years later I remembered it and had to order it. And it is worth every dime you spend on it. Now, I don't want to give anything about the movie away, but there was one review on here stating that their perspective of Keith was one of a brat, which I have to strongly disagree on. In my opinion, this person did not quite grasp the meaning of the film. In my opinion, his character is more mysterious and laid back. I think Jesse McCartney did an amazing role playing as Keith.

Given the amazing talent of the two main characters, this is in my top 20 movies of all time. It nails the excruciating ordeals of the high school experience. It is subdued, eloquent, evocative and haunting.

  The brilliant and playful young Keith is in chemo and faces a death sentence. He has been in love with Nathalie since grade school, but she never ""saw"" him, so as a dying wish he asks his science teacher to make her his lab partner. Their sublime chemistry is kismet: each brings the other to life. He could accept his death sentence until he realizes she loves him, then death becomes hateful and bitter.

3665517,2,B001KEGRBQ,"There are some really extreme reviews on this website. One very positive review gushingly declares: ""Keith is one of the most beautiful, powerful, serious, joyful, triumphant, and universally relevant movies any of us will ever see."" SERIOUSLY? I have seen episodes of the Golden Girls that come much closer to that description than this film.

On the other extreme, a negative reviewer says: ""This film can only be compared to giving yourself paper cuts in all of the tender parts of your body while sitting in a bathtub full of lemon juice and broken glass and reading Nicholas Sparks."" Take this for what it is -- pure hyperbole.

Falling somewhere in the middle of these two positions is the movie Keith. This film tells the story of Natalie -- a very devoted, somewhat high-strung, and popular student -- who falls for Keith -- a very disconnected and reckless young man.  Natalie goes for Keith despite the fact that she already has an attractive, caring and smart boyfriend. Near the end of the film, the viewer learns why Keith is so callous about life. Along the way, however, the movie has many shortcomings.

FIRST, Keith is written as a much older character. He has too much texture for a high school student. He is too cynical. He is too far ahead of the game. The resolution does not provide enough to explain his behavior. It strikes me as part of his overall character -- not something brought on by developments in his life.

SECOND, Natalie acts in very unexpected ways. Suddenly, a bright student on her way to Duke unravels because of an obnoxious, narcissistic schoolmate. This is far-fetched. Blaming her parents is just too trite and simplistic. This part of the plot was very unbelievable. It was also sexist. The woman gives up everything she has to ""rescue"" the troubled man....and in the end, she really learns what life is all about. What's the value of education and sports? Why stay with a very refined boyfriend who is headed to Penn? All of that stuff makes her cold.

THIRD, All three parents are empty shells. They could have been omitted altogether; that's how little they are developed.

FOURTH, By hiding the reason for Keith's behavior so long, a reasonable viewer would simply find him to be an annoying narcissist. He is very nonchalant about homework. He seems to hate hard work. He puts down people who want to grow. While the plot resolution tries to explain it, this comes way too late. By the time I learned the truth about Keith, I thought he was simply a brat who needed to grow up. His situation did not change that -- namely, because others in the same position have not become so evil and because we do not even learn many details about his situation, despite its impact upon his life.

On the plus side: This movie will probably appeal more to young people or people who are dealing with these issues for the first time. I am reluctant to recommend it even to younger folks, however, because I think that both Natalie and Keith behave irresponsibly. The most likable character -- Rafael -- ends up losing.

Another plus: The actress who played Natalie put in a good performance. If you are a fan of this genre (after-school special), then you will enjoy her. She outmatched the actor who played Keith by miles.

Finally, The movie does send a message about keeping life into perspective and pursuing passions. In this film, I think this ultimately becomes a twisted message because pursuing passion does not mean neglecting the stability that an education provides. But even for people who do traditional things like going to college, this message could mean something.

Overall, the negative aspects of the film outweigh the good parts. I ended up not liking Keith or Natalie. They were too reckless. Keith was too obnoxious. And neither seemed like anyone I remember from high school or anyone with whom I would care to spend much time.

You might like it, however. Don't vote against my review simply because I didn't. I have given my honest opinion free of hyperbole.",1338681600,18,4022,4.738197424892704

3665526,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Jesse McCarney is showing in this movie a undescribable performance. In fact, it was the first time I really believed an actor that his character is ""real"". He gives the movie something more than words can say.
Jesse McCartneys powerfull acting lets the audience feel sympathy with the character and shows us an impressive movie about love and unavoidable destiny.
It is just amazing how the movie is set up, you actually have to think about it and not every little detail is showed by a focused camera picture that everybody noticed it and will say afterwards: ""Oh did you see that wasn`t that amazing"". The movie doesn`t want that it just shows you the reality and it does it great.
It is not one of those Blockbuster movies with these famous actors who are reputed to be great. No it actually is a movie with truly great actors and a plot which is not like every other love story.

The characters are exceptional and Keith (Jesse McCartney) is unforgettable. Some detractors decry that this movie incorporates many aspects that are ""unoriginal."" If you are not a pedantic movie critic, such things will be meaningless. I am especially sensitive and annoyed when movies don't live up to the standards of reality, and amazingly nothing about this movie feels fake to me. That's a good thing, especially considering that movies of this type are often sky high in the cheeziness factor. You will laugh, you will feel as the characters do, in sadness and joy to great extents. Watching this movie is an experience, and it has become of my favorites.

This movie delivers in ways that would be an unrealistic expectation for most. I consider this movie much like the experience of watching the Notebook, the only chick-flick that's a genuinely good movie. It also has the feel of The Breakfast Club, being something of a coming of age movie. I don't think it'd be wrong to call Keith what you'd get if you mixed The Breakfast Club and The Notebook.

She finally gives in and lets him love her and then he acts like an idiot. It took forever to realize that Keith was going through some issues and it was infuriating. He finally came to his senses but I was kind of over it at that point. All in all it was okay but again not my favorite.",1314662400,,924,3.9731182795698925
3665535,5,B001KEGRBQ,"First of all I have to say that this is my first review ever. I write it for just one simple reason: ""Keith"" touched my heart.
I haven't watched a movie in a lifetime that made me think about it for days and weeks. I haven't seen a film that made me want to watch it over and over again... Until I watched ""Keith"" for the first time.
The film is about everything that life's about. Friendship, opportunities, losses, changes... and overall it's about love.
""Keith"" is playing in a highschool scene, but it's not a highschool romance at all. Of course there are the popular kids and the outsiders, of course Natalie is one of the it-girls, tennis crack, yearbook writer, with a bright future lying in front of her. And of course Keith is the total opposite...
As far as I can see that's the only similarity to other teen romances or teen dramas.
Everything else is just amazing, surprising, mindblowing. The love story of Keith and Natalie touched my heart and my soul like nothing else ever did before. ""Keith"" is sad, but I didn't cry. ""Keith"" is funny, but I didn't laugh out loud. ""Keith"" is silent, and that's what makes this movie so powerful. I fell in love with Keith as Natalie did and I smiled after Keith left as Natalie did. You might get the feeling that Keith can change your own life as much as he did with Natalie's.
This movie is full of hope, and that's what I like about it. It is possible to leave the given paths, it is possible to find love at the strangest places, it is possible to move on to a better life. It is possible to find the one person who can look through your build up walls and break them down. It is possible to enjoy the given time with the one person you love, even when the time is much too short.
5 stars for the story, 5 stars for the actors, 5 stars for love...
One of the reviewers wrote that he would keep ""Keith"" if he could keep just one of his dvds... I second that. I would do exactly the same. I would keep the best movie I've ever watched!",1314489600,9,1990,4.239473684210527
3665536,5,B001KEGRBQ,"This movie is extremely poignant in its depiction of two people trapped in their circumstances.  They are drawn to each other and ultimately help each other to gain their release.  Keith, played by Jesse McCartney is trapped by his medical circumstances and pushes everyone away. Natalie, played by Elisabeth Heloise is trapped by her parents' framing her life for her.  Natalie finally breaks through his veneer and allows him to love, Keith opens a window for Natalie and allows her to have her own dreams. The acting by these two is very good, especially by Mr. McCartney.  It is ashamed that the movie was pigeon holed as a teenage flick.  The international awards it received were all for Juvenile/Teenager categories and was consequently never distributed widely.  As a result, many people are just now discovering this picture with virtually all reviews being 4 or 5 stars, on this site and every other site where the movie is reviewed.  Those that are low are because the movie is crushing and not totally a feel-good flick. McCartney was able to bring Keith to life that echoes with real life situations on so many levels; being outside of the group, the loss of potential and opportunity, the loss prematurely of a loved one, and the importance of loving and being loved. I have watched it more times than I can count and I always end up feeling like I am mourning for the loss of a real person.  I wish that Todd Kessler would release some of the cut portions.  I also wish the CD had other specials on it like making of the movie, interviews and such as we see on many other CD's. I hope that some studio will give McCartney a chance at another meaningful role so we can see if he is as others say, another Decaprio.  His acting in this movie certainly indicates that he has that ability.",1314144000,2,1800,4.596875

3665539,5,B001KEGRBQ,"""We're here in a yellow truck a road ahead of us and nothing but opportunities"".

Hold on to your box of Kleenex because you'll need it after you get a dose of Keith.
Natalie, a high school overachiever with a bright future and everything in order gets  paired with Keith as her lab partner, a free spirited person that takes life as it comes. Not only are these two the total opposite of each other but their chemistry is undeniable and inevitable. With the ups and downs between the main characters and Natalie trying to discover whats she wants and who she is, brings a realistic and heart-filled tone to the movie.

The characters are believable, the story doesn't stray and the ending doesn't disappointed. Keith is a definitely must see.

Favorite quotes from Keith
Keith: [spills liquid on chem table] Ohh god.
Natalie: Be more careful would you?
Keith: Am I gonna be in trouble for that? Are you gonna punish me for this?
Natalie: I might have to.
Keith: 'Cause you know how I feel about all that stuff.
Natalie: Look partner, you know the deal.
Keith: But those spiky heels really hurt me.
Natalie: Keith, you've been a bad boy and now you gotta pay the price
[Keith groans]
Natalie: [She looks at the people sharing their chem lab table who are staring] Do you mind?",1306713600,2,1276,4.558951965065503
3665540,5,B001KEGRBQ,"What a wonderful movie! I feel that what made this such a beautiful movie is the fact that it has something that we can ""all"" identify with. We are invited to see something of ourselves in the dramas that unfold. What I loved most was how it beautifully expressed that intangible something, that force that can powerfully unhinge us from the superficial, trival things that don't really matter.

Natalie represents that part of us that does care about what people think about us. The part that is limited and constricted by our own expectations. Keith, on the other hand, is that aspect that wants to live today as if it was the very last. Two, very different, seemingly opposite personalities, yet this force (Love) that brought them together, shakes all of their identifications loose. Suddenly none of that superficial stuff matters anymore, all of the egocentric constrictions fall off. I don't want to give away too much, but there is one part in the movie that caused my cheecks to get soaked with tears! And I never cry! I think that reason is that deep in our heart, we know that ""true,"" ""pure,"" ""unconditional"" love can be the light that casts away all shodow aspects of our psyche.

All of the actors played their roles very well. The tears, facial expressions, all drew me in and made the emotional curretns believable. I was vicariously living this play and breathed a sigh at the end. I felt blessed to be Spirit living this human experience, to be able to savor and fully appreciate this love song that life really is.

Enjoy the movie, but make sure that you have plenty of tissues next to you!

The doomed character in both is wonderful, and your heart goes out to them, on their potential - the life they could have had. For Keith, there is no religion to fill in that gap - there is just this bleak existentialism, ""you live and then you die."" While he saves the girl from a course of boredom, he makes her try way too hard to figure him out, to produce the denouement in the end, his final goodbye.

3665545,5,B001KEGRBQ,"I don't pretend to be someone who's big into online commentary. In fact, I'm 29 and this is the first review I've ever written. Although I do consider myself a movie buff, I've never felt the need to comment on any of the movies I've seen, simply because most of them were forgettable. Sure, at the time, I may have thought certain films were outstanding,even moving. But nothing, and I mean nothing, has ever caused me to feel so passionate and so involved as this movie. It haunts me still! I find myself thinking about it in the middle of my work day, causing me to smile, or shed a quiet tear.

I recently lost my best friend to illness (not cancer but similar) and it's been almost a year. I haven't cried over her. I continue on with my life thinking if I just push forward and don't feel anything, that things will be okay. When I stumbled upon this movie on netflix, I thought it would be a cheezy teen indie dramedy similar to countless others I've seen and at best, it will atleast put me to sleep quickly (I'm an insomniac). Suddenly, I stepped into Keith's world and found myself enthralled.

The acting was superb to say the least, and while I did enjoy Elisabeth Harnois' performance, I have to say that Jesse McCartney was phenomenal as Keith. His performance was impeccable, and so incredibly believable. The chemistry between these two was electric. I felt it's waves coming at me through the TV set. I can go on to discuss the writing, plot, beautiful imagery, etc, etc. But, we love movies not simply for what they are, but for the way they make us FEEL. This movie touched me and awakened a place in me that I thought had died a year ago, with my best friend. After seeing this movie, something happened. My heart opened up, and I felt sad, and happy, and full again. I must have cried for hours after that movie ended, and that night, I had the best sleep I've had in a year. If you're tired of the same old thing, and you, like me are looking for something, something REAL, and TRUE, and moving, then please, see this movie.

3665550,5,B001KEGRBQ,"I'm older than any of you.  I can tell that by just reading what most of you wrote.  The only McCartney I have ever heard of is Paul.  But just the same, I loved this film.  It reminded me of Sweet November (not the monstrosity created by Keannu Reeves, who couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, but the original 1968 version with Anthony Newly - another excellent film)

I've read the one star reviews of Keith and in my opinion the reviewers are either mentally challenged or simply never considered looking beyond the surface of a story.

This is what most reviewers here don't see.  Harnois lived in a box.  Her values were determined by what she was told from early childhood they should be.  Success meant going to a top 10 University, doing well academically, and scoring with the guys.  She was happy in this artificial world until someone from the outside came knocking.

In McCartney's world success meant waking up for the next day.  He dealt with his affliction by humorous and sarcastic deflection.  At the same time he liked Harnois and decided to introduce himself into her plastic world.

As you see the two of them slowly falling in love with each other - one knowingly, the other unconscious of it - you begin to see Harnois breaking the shell which kept her prisoner which she never knew was there.  Her love causes her to break out of societies paradigm and discover what living life on her own terms is like.  As the movie ends she is living it out on McCartney's terms but you know she will soon break out into her own.

It's a journey of self-discovery and in the end is truly a joyful film, well acted and well written.  Hell, I even liked the music!",1292371200,33,1677,4.442622950819672

Although the film introduces her as someone with a decent future and a fairly normal teenage psyche (despite the fact that the actress playing her is actually about 30- look it up people), our lovely leading lady is immediately infected with the insidious destructiveness that is Keith.  Not only does Keith lead her to give up on her athletic career and her academic prowess, he also apparently decimates her self-esteem and robs her of her virginity.  In short, Keith, like a gut-sucking intestinal parasite, takes everything from this poor girl, leaving her with an inconceivable sense of loss for the person who, for lack of better phrasing, ruined her life and gave her very little in return except for an appreciation for thrift store bowling balls and giving up on life.",1275436800,22,1074,4.789189189189189

3665561,5,B001KEGRBQ,"This is a very good film that did not get much advertisement. I rented it out of curiosity and because I loved it so much, I just had to buy it.

Jesse McCartney, as Keith, proves that he is multi-talented in this, his ""first major feature film role"" as he pulls you right in to his character, causing you to not only love him but hate him and in the end... he yanks your heart right out of your chest. You just can't stop watching because it's not only a love story but a mystery where you just have to find out what he's up to.

Keith is a high school senior who is seemly playing a mean trick on a very popular girl, Natalie (played by Elisabeth Harnois, ""My Date With The President's Daughter"") who has all of life's advantages at her feet. Keith doesn't appear to care about anything, anyone or have any friends as he's clearly not a part of the teen social scene. As Keith pops in and out of her days, Natalie begins to seek him out, developing a secret fondness for him. Since you don't know what his plan is, you worry that he's going to break her heart and you are rooting for her to figure him out. But there's a dark twist to the plot.

In this film you'll find a contrast from Jesse's role on the TV show Summerland (2004-05) in which he played the ultra cool, fun loving, bleached blonde, surfer with lots of opportunity for sexy poses showing off his ""All American"" boy beauty. In this film, even though he plays an aloof, grunged-down character, wearing holey clothing and dirty hair, his sex appeal is no less. This film is the beginning of Jesse's transformation in real life to his natural, dark haired, adult image.

3665565,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Keith is a movie about teenagers in high school, but it is not a high school movie. Reviewers who put it into that category, or who recommend it for teenagers only, are missing the point. The characters could be almost any age and in almost any situation, and very little else would have to change. Having them be attractive teenagers only means more people will see the movie, which is good.

Keith is one of the most beautiful, powerful, serious, joyful, triumphant, and universally relevant movies any of us will ever see. It is about what it means to be a human being in a random world, about how it feels to be inside--and outside--a powerful social and political system.

But above all Keith is about love--not the phony, sentimental melodrama of Hollywood romance, and not the impulsive, hormone-fueled engine of adolescence, but the love that selects two people, draws them together into one, and carries them together through every challenge that comes against them. Keith is about real joy and real pain, about life and death and everything in between.

Keith is a remarkable and very rare work of art. Every word, every gesture, every expression on every actor's face, every scene, every moment of this movie is perfect. Characters emerge and develop and grow and interact and fail and overcome as they should in every movie but almost never do.

I without a doubt, advise you to watch this movie, and dare you to let it move you the way it moved me. Excellent, 5 stars.",1252972800,53,460,4.423529411764706

3665580,5,B001KEGRBQ,"The movie was beautiful, one of my FAVORITES in a while. I will definitely buy it.

It is similar to a Walk to Remember, but it is less chick-flicky... more of the Indie feel where it's at a slower pace, shows emotions, does not have a Hollywood story-telling style like something such as Maid in Manhatten (not so straight forward, guy meets girl, happy ending). It's deeper, it's less happy, but it's more beautiful because of that.

 It is a little predictable though, but I think that doesn't matter... the emotions.. the calmness of the film, it holds its own beauty. It's not a crazy-new Indie.. (jarring, shaky or anything). It still has beautiful camera work, and it just.. feels REAL. The drama is real, the emotions are stronger, the film is a lot more moving. I'm almost 21, and I thought the high school drama would be too much, but it's not. If you like chick flicks, but you also like to think and feel, watch Keith.",1249689600,16,930,4.523809523809524

The story line is pretty simple but the movie is well done and has a meaningful message. Jesse McCartney and Elisabeth Harnois are great !

3665584,5,B001KEGRBQ,"I was not expecting a lot from this movie when i rented it, but it is beyond words. I was shocked by how amazing this movie is. It is the best movie I have ever seen (which is saying a lot). This is a movie that sticks with you long after you watch it.",1240790400,6,252,3.685185185185185
3665585,3,B001KEGRBQ,"Keith is a film about Natalie(Elisabeth Harnois) and Keith(Jesse McCartney) two high school kids on opposite ends of the social spectrum. Natalie is a star tennis player, yearbook editor, college scholarship award-ee and all around popular girl with a new hunky athlete boyfriend, Keith on the other hand is a social outcast with an affinity for rebuilding cars. When Keith and Natalie are paired as lab partners, their whole lives start to change.

Though Natalie tries her best to keep her distance, something mysterious and magnetic continues to drag Keith more and more into her life, uncovering dark secrets along the way.

Keith is a slightly darker version of 'A Walk to Remember', although I just think I might prefer Keith. The tragedy and pain in this movie is so perfectly conveyed, though the plot might not be entirely original.

I must admit I was pleasantly surprised with Jesse McCartney's acting, as Keith he really embodied a snarky, cynical teenager without making him the slightest bit unlikeable. I couldn't tear my eyes away whenever he was on the screen.

It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it IS good.",1240272000,27,1134,4.9214659685863875
3665586,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Travelling from Dream Street via ""Summerland"", Jesse McCartney has arrived as a mature and serious performer in Todd Kessler's very different coming-of-age movie, ""Keith"". McCartney, as Keith, is teamed with Elisabeth Harnois as Natalie, his high school contemporary, and supported by a tighly written screenplay by Kessler and David Zabel.

The storyline is unconventional and explores the developing relationship between Natalie, a serious and capable student, and Keith, her laboratory partner, a seemingly carefree boy with a chilling secret which Natalie eventually uncovers.

""Keith"" is an excellent film, a love story with a twist, which holds the viewer to the last moment.",1240099200,,681,5.666666666666667
3665587,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that touches me beyond what is normal, and this is that movie. I can't stop thinking about it. Both Elisabeth Harnois and Jesse McCartney were entirely believable and beautifully poignant in their portrayal of the leads; the emotion felt real to me. On top of this, the mystery was well sustained, and the atmosphere of the plot was thick, dark and riveting. I am normally not much of a Jesse McCartney person, as I don't follow his music or whatever other acting he has done, but the depth and intensity with which he portrayed Keith in this movie kept me completely captivated.

No matter how many times I watch this, I never get sick of it, and I never fail to be emotionally effected. The plot is entirely unassuming; it does not try to lecture you, show off how witty it is, or melodramatically draw out every moment. Instead, it has a simple clarity and beauty that should not be missed. Additionally, I can say as a high school student that although the actors were perhaps too old for their roles, the portrayal of high school otherwise was one of the most realistic that I've seen in a movie. I could sympathize with both main characters in different ways, and yet they never failed to surprise and entertain me. This is perhaps one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen, and not at all the chick-flick comedy that I expected it to be.",1238284800,6,1394,4.488188976377953

This movie has been completed for a while now, and has only recently been released.  It's probably only because Jesse has become mainstream popular again with his new album Departure.

3665592,5,B001KEGRBQ,"Normally I would give a high school film like this a 3 or 4 star rating because of all the normal shortcomings (adults playing teens, roles filled with characters you would never see in high school, everything falling into place at the wrong times, etc.) but this little gem managed to find a way through all of that and get a 5. And that was tough when one of the leads was obviously 30 - but we had to believe he was 18...anyway.

A simple enough story about teens finding themselves, what they want to do in life, partying, getting scholarships, and finding ""love"" all while dealing with those pesky adults. I do not follow music enough to know this guy was some music superstar with teens, but he managed to pull off a very believable performance. And speaking of performances, way to go Elisabeth Harnois. Great work for both of these kids. Through the course of events we see how a believable relationship gets formed between our leads, yet still maintains a sense of difficulty that comes with these hormone-filled lifestyles. I have to say there was some great writing and a few laugh-out loud moments.

Middle of the road music, LA-style parties, quality filming, recognizable supporting performances, and a sampling of what one might wish their high school relationships could have been like makes this all for a fun film. And yes, the fun crashes to a in-your-face way by the end, but I think the emotional impact stays with you after the credits roll. Put aside the obvious age miscasts on all of the high school students (except for our main two) and you will see a great film with a meaningful message.
