8201678,2,B000RO6K1M,"Worth about $18.00, but not much more.

Firstly, the picture quality is quit grainy on my 42"" 1080 HD TV...probably shot on non HD Video. Looks almost as bad as a VHS tape...The lighting is too dark in many places. The opera has only one sparsely decorated set. The costumes are OK, but not great.

The singers, none of whom I know, are again OK, but none are memorable.

The directing and acting routine, orchestra all OK, but not memorable....

The English is OK, but there are no subtitles and I cannot aways understand the words..

All told, I would advise to spend more on a blue ray disk, with a better cast, and you would enjoy this great opera better.",1331078400,,659,4.413223140495868
8201679,5,B000RO6K1M,"If there is a reason to purchase this DVD of Mozart's masterpiece ""The Magic Flute"" it's to hear the phenomenal singing put forth by these vocalists.  I highly recommend purchasing this for the sole purpose of hearing American tenor Gran Wilson portraying the role of Tamino.  A remarkable voice, it's unfortunate that there are not more recordings of his singing.",1295481600,2,364,5.05

I would love to give it 5 stars but  being sung in English is disconcerting. But strange as it may seem, being sung in English w/o the care of following along with the subtitles actually allows one to listen more closely to the  marvels of  Mozart's masterpiece. However, that said, I still prefer hearing the Flute in the original German.

The  singing is absolutely excellent with the possible exception of Donald Shanks (Sarastro) who's not always on pitch.  Pamina (Yvonne Kenny) wonderful to look at and listen to.  Three boys, Anthony Phipps, Andrew Wentzel and Cameron Phipps, a positive joy. Christa Leahmann (Queen of the Night) a knock out. Camera work and staging excellent. Richard Bonynge's conducting brings out every nuance of the Flute and is equal to the marvelous Claudio Abbado's Flute on  CD.

I say all of this  considering the other fine DVD versions:  the superb Horst Stein 1971  with the top notch Nicolai Gedda and the luminous and - lovely to look at -  Edith Mathis (Art Haus), the excellent Sawallisch 1983 (Deutsche Grammophon), Levine's 1982 Salzburger (TDK) & his 1991 Met ( Deutsche Grammophon), Ivan Fischer's 2001 (TDK) and Colin Davis's 2003 (Opus Arte ).

Stay away from Arnold Ostman's/ Drottningholm  and Bernard Haitink who use three women instead of three boys for the three spirits -a sacrilege-  completely missing the other- worldliness of young boy's voices. Also stay away from the overrated Ingmar Bergman with ponderous tempi followed by stop and start film inserts along with "" reaction shots"" of members of the ""audience"".",1267833600,5,1630,5.044943820224719
8201681,4,B000RO6K1M,"The Magic Flute by Mozart must be one of the most difficult operas to stage because its story line is so uneven and in places contradictory; Why is the Queen of the Night in the beginning the poor victim of a dictatorial priest and later a villain? it is a contradiction that to my knowledge nobody has yet solved. There are other problems; for example the entrance of Tamino, usually he rushes onto the stage crying for help and faints. This creates right from the start an impression that he is a weakling, not a hero. In  this production of Opera Australia as he enters the stage he turns back and shoots off his last arrow a simple wordless gesture that makes his cry for help much more plausible. Nonetheless to me it is always Pamina who is the real heroin, as also in this production. The other hero in this piece - as far as I am concerned - is Papageno. I know he is supposed to be a comic charachter (which he is) but underneath all that he is down to earth and makes no bones about that:it is Papageno who finds Pamina not Tamino. This production negotiates most of the difficulties with aplomb.
The singers are all very professional, though I must admit the Queen gave me a few uneasy moments. The three boys are excellent and so boyish that  one wonders if that is due to the direction or just them. Sarastro is a little unconvincing at times. Pamina is a joy; excellent singing and a convincing heroin. After all it is she who leads Tamino through fire and  water though in this production it would seem to be Tamino, but listen to the text: it is her alright!
I was sorry it was in English - I always prefer  the original language - but I must say the translator did  a very good job, taking full advantage of the linguistic similarities between German and English. Nor was there any producer's mucking around with the original text (Which these days is but too common!).
I found the orchestral part a little lifeless but am not sure whether this was due to recording, my loudspeakers or the actual playing, so that I give them the benefit of the doubt, especially as Richard Bonynge is conducting.
All in all a most enjoyable production, after all it is easy to punch holes into almost any performance. A DVD I am happy to have on my shelves",1206489600,5,2257,4.402877697841727
8201682,3,B000RO6K1M,"The  music  of  Mozart  is  so  easy  to  listen  to,  that  even  not  musically  talented people  can  enjoy  it. many  reviewers  over  the  centuries  analyzed  the  libretto  and  read  many  hidden  meanings  into  it.  Schikaneder,  the  actor  who  wrote  the  libretto  never  would  have  been  known,  were  it  not  for  Mozarts  music.  The  magic  flute  is  so  much  fantasy  and  so  colorful,  that  all  opera-houses  compete  to  bring  something  different  to  their  production. With  DVDs  you  can  watch  performances  from  all  over  the  world.  This  one  is  neither  imaginative,  nor  colorful,  which  is  disappointing  to  me.  Therefore  I  give  it  just  3  stars.",1205366400,3,703,4.87378640776699
