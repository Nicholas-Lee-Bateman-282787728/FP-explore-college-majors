2878362,5,B000S0GYOS,"Judith Jamison, Rennie Harris and Robert Battle are awesome choreographers in the moving ballet ""Love Stories"" past, present,and future. ""Visually Spectacular""! and the Alvin Ailey dancers are nothing short of extraordinary, they are the best, see them in various interviews, then watch them rehearse and deliver a tour de force performance! This documentary is shot in New York and Russia, and gives you a litte history on Alvin Ailey and his legacy as well as the classy Judith Jamison and what she has done to continue that legacy. Whether you are a fan of modern dance or not, I dare you to catch the Alvin Ailey Dance Company live on tour and /or order your copy of ""Beyond the Steps"" today....you will really be glad you did!",1202860800,26,731,4.7637795275590555

8203608,5,B000S0GYOS,"I am an avid follower of Alvin Ailey and attend at least four performance every year at City Center in NYC.
I loved this video of the back scenes of the company.  It only made me appreciate them more.  If you are a fan of the company, you will love this video and the total performance on the end of the tape.",1401148800,2,309,3.967741935483871
8203609,4,B000S0GYOS,The Ailey video was very well out together. It offered great insight into the life of an Ailey dancer as well as captured the dancers in their element. Well done!,1351987200,,162,4.433333333333334
8203610,5,B000S0GYOS,DVD came on time even during the christmas season rush and was great quality.  The price couldn't be beat elsewhere.  I will order from here again!  The DVD was new and not packed in cheap packaging....,1231804800,,202,4.555555555555555
8203611,5,B000S0GYOS,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to show my children that African Americans can excel in the area of dance. This is so much more than I anticipated. In addition to truly exceptional professional dancing, there are also interviews with Judith Jamison and several of the dancers and other choreographers. We see dance rehearsals and as an added bonus there is a live performance of Love Story. My children love this DVD and I do too. We've only had it two days and already we've watched it about five times. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone interested dance, no matter how old you are.",1227398400,16,584,4.571428571428571
