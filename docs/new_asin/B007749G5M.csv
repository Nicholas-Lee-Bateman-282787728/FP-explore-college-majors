8511548,5,B007749G5M,"I bought ""The Servant"" DVD a few years ago in a the pre-owned section of my neighborhood video rental shop. I have VHS copies of others but they are all in TV format not their original widescreen. This director is an American, but is often compared to David Lean the British director whose style (as far as the ""look"" of the film) is similar. If you admire the beauty of David Lean's epics- you'd probably like Joe Losey too. An underrated director- rather ""edgy"" even by today's standards. Many of his films are ""flawed"" and not ""perfect"" but still worth watching. Today's audience may not have the patience to tolerate the slow-moving drama of some of his films and the ""psychological situations"" of the Pinter scripts. It might be worth it to get a multi-region DVD player for your computer or player for your TV just to see this difficult to find films. (Which is what I did, simply because there are many British films and TV programs that are unavailable as region 1 discs.)",1367107200,,980,4.605714285714286
