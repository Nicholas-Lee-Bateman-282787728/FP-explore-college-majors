7981340,5,B00008AWSA,"I have just completed a binge watch of season two of Belle et Sebastien, the beautiful 1960s Gaumont RTF drama series about a boy and his dog. It is a great adventure romp through the stunning french countryside, and is very well acted and written. Mehdi el-Glaoui, who plays Sebastien, is France's Dennis Waterman (a cheeky chappie who stars in the show and sings the theme song), and in the best tradition of TV dramas with canine heroines, where Lassie is a laddie, Belle, in this case, is a beau!

This is the second tranche of Belle et Sebastien, a charming introduction to French television drama at its best!",1469836800,,615,4.6422018348623855
