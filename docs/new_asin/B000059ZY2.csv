7934514,3,B000059ZY2,"David Carradine .... professional driver .... to race in this race, he needs a car.  Classic Love story driver meets photographer, they go 3000 miles and fall in love.  It's cute .... though the arch enemy is a classic villan .... in the vein of 60's cartoons.  The only thing he didn't do is capture and tie someone to a rail road track.

Yes it was silly .... and a little far fetched .... but it was cute, a classic love story .... and good triumphs over evil .... what could be bad about that?",1415836800,,497,4.2
7934515,2,B000059ZY2,"2 stars... all for the movie.  One of my favorite films, but this transfer is awful.

I had a VHS recording from analog cable... and the transfer was better than this.
The picture is overly soft and the colors and whites are dull.

I can't recommend the transfer, but the movie is still fun.",1345161600,,291,4.351851851851852
7934516,2,B000059ZY2,"Not Cannonball Run or Death Race 2000, but funny at times.  ""Why are there so many baboons on the road?""",1211155200,,104,4.2
7934517,4,B000059ZY2,"Many tongue-in-cheek contestants in Trans

African 3000 mile race (long since discon-

tinued) with cars supported by different

companies/countries. Check out the french

driveers dialogue! Channing supposedly works

for Playboy! Director Harry Hurwitz gets

cameo. Longshot style of filming suits this

film well. Wildlife is very good in here as

well. Cna you belevie that kooky Hamilton

Camp is Colleen's (Smokey and the Bandit 3)

father? Christopher Lee has also done films

with Carradine's father, John. Funny and

not to be taken too seriously!",1154390400,,555,5.476190476190476
7934518,5,B000059ZY2,"this one of those movies that never won an academy award,
probably got mediocre reviews, and has been largely forgotten
by the movie-going public.  for me, however, it is one of those movies that i never tire of seeing over and over.  christopher lee gets to
do deadpan comedy and rest of the cast do a terrific job of
dealing with the african desert.  stockard channing has to cope
with a baby baboon climbing over her for most of the movie and it is interesting to see her professionalism in handling it.",1012694400,,506,4.478260869565218
7934519,5,B000059ZY2,"Cunning.  Ingenious. Skillful.
There are words that accuratly describe the Harry Hurwitz masterpiece know as Safari 3000.  Hurwitz, who had directed such cinematic gems as 1994's Fleshtone and 1984's No Tell Hotel, hones in on greatness in his Junior effort.  Set in the large and wild country of Africa, David Carradine and Stockard Channing team up as stunt-man and writer, competing to win an international road-race.  There are many elements of this movie that are extremely rewarding, expecailly how Hurwitz decided to set the movie in Africa.  What a joy!  Now Africa has the distinction of gaining notiriety from not just Safari 3000, but Ace Ventura Two When Nature Calls, Ernest Goes to Africa, and Shaft in Africa.  When did this country get so popular?  If you haven't seen this cult classic, by all means go to your local Blockbuster and demand that the inept teenage chashier orders five, if not ten copies.  We all have a chance of dying as each day passes.  Not seeing this film would be a sin, unless your ""special"" like Timothy Rice.",1008201600,6,1050,4.848314606741573
7934520,5,B000059ZY2,"Safari 3000 has a delightful graininess that makes it feel real.  It could be a wholesome cult film, if such a thing is possible.  It's an adventure movie, but only one person gets killed.  The characterization is superb.  David Carradine and Stockard Channing are a team that have entered a three-day road race across Africa.  He's a Hollywood stunt man determined to win, and she's just there to write a story for her magazine.  Christopher Lee, their nemesis, is a ruthless rich Italian nobleman who wears a Darth Vader helmet.  This movie appeals to those who enjoy characterization and a lively pace.",994204800,,605,4.872549019607843
7934521,2,B000059ZY2,"If you are looking to laugh outloud while watching a movie, then buy this movie right away and watch it.  However, you will only be laughing at the utter stupiditiy that must have gone though the minds of the directors while making this film.  With no big name stars, and basically no plot at all, this film amazingly earned 2 stars in this review because it made me laugh at it's simple, pathetic attempt at cinema.  An international race through the African Safari?  Wow!  I do not know where the idea for this film came from, nor do I really care to find out.  I am glad I watched it however, because now I have the honor of claiming that I have seen the worst movie ever produced in the history of film making.  Own it.  Watch it.  Laugh at it.",992217600,5,748,4.24822695035461
