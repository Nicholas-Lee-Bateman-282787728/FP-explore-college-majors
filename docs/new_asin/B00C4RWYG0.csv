5690679,4,B00C4RWYG0,"This is billed as an historical drama and the lines of `Torres' that were built over a year and a half to be the last line of defence against Napoleon and his Grand Army.  We meet a selection of characters to tell the story including a whore, a Major in the British Army, a mute beggar a man looking for his lost wife and a Portuguese Sergeant hell bent on revenge for the loss of his wife and child plus a few more.

Malkovich is billed as starring and he does do a few minutes of screen time in what some may call a clichd version of Wellington - complete with him reciting the recipe for the dish that bears his name. Catherine Deneuve also puts in a fleeting performance. This though is a patchwork of stories depicting the human cost of war, including the rapine and plunder that is concomitant with so many conflicts. It though is not a war film and that is where it falls down. We have a cast of thousands to tell the story of a war that laid waste to more than one country and not a single battle is shown, just a skirmish.

If you like films that are more thought provoking than action packed, then this will be right up your street. This was originally a TV mini series called `As Linhas de Torre Vedras' and was shown in three parts and had an extra twenty minute run time. This though still felt like the editor had been asleep on the job with some scenes seeming to add very little, that may be because of continuity issues with the TV adaptation. Being generous I would give this seven out of ten, but am rounding up to four stars. It is in Portuguese, English and French, the sub titles too could have been better, most folk know what `merde' really means for instance and it lasts for a stonking 151 minutes. It is still a very reasonable film, but I preferred the `Sharp' series with Sean Been and they were made for a shoe string compared to this.",1416096000,22,1865,4.247887323943662
5690680,5,B00C4RWYG0,"Lines of Wellington begins with a panoramic shot over a battlefield on which looters search and strip the dead of valuables.  It's an appropriate beginning for a movie which depicts both the great sweep of history as well as the impact that sweep has on the men and women who are its victims.

In 1809-10 Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Iberian Peninsula, seeking to add Portugal and Spain to his already vast Empire.  The British sent an army to assist the Portuguese and Spanish forces defending their countries, and the result was a long and brutal campaign.  This film ably depicts a small segment of that conflict, showing the decisions and movements not only of leaders like Wellington (John Malkovich) but also of the ordinary soldiers on both sides and the Portuguese civilians who were caught in the middle.

The battle scenes and the depictions of the wounded are graphic, but that's all to the good, since a war movie sanitized of blood and violence is worse than useless.  Malkovich's depiction of Wellington as a somewhat pompous general who is nevertheless determined to stick to his mission regardless of cost is impressive (and very true to history.)  The film is largely told in French and Portuguese, with some English here and there, with English subtitles.",1414972800,6,1275,4.929906542056075

This is like a Portuguese version of War & Peace.",1413936000,2,316,4.642857142857143
5690682,4,B00C4RWYG0,"""Lines of Wellington"" (2012 release from France/Portugal; 151 min.) brings the story of the 1820 invasion of the French troupes of Napoleon into Portugal. As the movie opens, we see the devastating scene of a battle that seemingly has just ended. Slowly but surely we are introduced to various characters whom we will follow in the movie: there is General Wellington (played by John Malkovich), whose British troops are siding with the Portuguese; there are the two sisters Severina and Cosima (played by Catherine Deneuve and Isabelle Huppert, respectively), there is the Portuguese lieutenant on the run from the French army, etc. etc. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a movie that is epic in scope on every level. The attention to details is amazing. The photography is even better, with long uninterrupted shots on many occasions (check out the opening scene). Second, this movie is directed by Valeria Sarmiento, who stepped in when her husband died before completing the movie (hence the movie is credited as ""conceived by Ral Ruiz, completed by Sarmiento""). Third, John Malkovich looks almost unrecognizable in this movie.

""Lines of Wellington"" was the September '14 release in Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club, which is how I got see this release. Why it's take over 2 years since it was initially released in Europe to finally get a US release is a mystery to me but better late than never I suppose.

The Film Movement release comes with an extra DVD of bonus materials, including an extensive ""Making Of"" documentary, of which I watched the initial 25 minutes. It is mostly a ""behind the scenes"" look at how the movie makers deal with logistical issues for filming these large battle scenes (how do all the soldiers get there? by bus of course!). Then there is the bonus shortie, which is  Film Movement tradition. This time it's an Australian shortie called ""Two Laps"" (5 min.), a B&W film of two old guys who swim laps in a pool each day. Just watch! Back to the main event: ""Lines of Wellington"" is another worthy addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library of indie and foreign movies, so check it out if you get the chance.",1411862400,6,2268,4.852713178294573
5690683,4,B00C4RWYG0,"This film is very unusual. On the one hand, it is made specifically with Portuguese historical and cultural sensibilities in mind. On the other, it is a sort of panoramic anti-war epic that shows the effects of total war on just about everyone. You follow the lives of many characters as they play out during this time. Chaos, murder, accidental death, severe dislocations of people, destruction of towns and cities, all are shown in an episodic, almost impressionistic sweep that encompasses few heroes or villains, just victims and survivors. Based on Wellington's famous battle lines formed around the hills of Lisbon in 1811, the French, who never defeated Wellington in battle, were forced to withdraw because they were exhausted and without supplies. The Napoleonic Wars in Spain were among the most horrific and savage of all the 19th century wars, and this adventure's failure whetted Napoleon's appetite to settle scores in Russia in 1812. We know what happened there. Think of these bookends of modern history: Napoleon first partnered by Hitler in the 20th century. Both were megalomaniacs intent on total domination.",1367280000,19,1128,5.2032967032967035

5690688,4,B00C4RWYG0,"This  is a slow  moving  work  steeped  in  the  history  of  the Peninsular  War.  In  1810  Napoleon  thought  he  might  finally  eliminate  The  British  in  Portugal.  These  two  elements  had  troubled  his  effort  in  Spain  since  1808 and  earlier.  Marshall  Andre Massensa  was  sent  with  a  large,  but  as  it  turned  out  NOT  large  enough  army  of  60,000 to  eliminate  the  Anglo-Portugal  problem.  Lord  Wellington  knew  that  the  French  were  coming  and had  prepared an  extensive  series  of  fortified  lines  call  Torres  Vadres  just outside  of  Lisbon.  Its  unfortunate  that  the  movie  was  not  named  WELLINGTON""S LINES  OF  TORRES  VADRES  instead.  The  current  title  is  vague  and  doesn't sound  good.  After  stinging  Massena  at  Busacco  where  the  French  lost  5,000  to  1,200  Anglo-Portugese,  Wellington fell  back  upon  his  fortified  lines  and  had  the  Portugese  populace  torch  their  land  thus  leaving  nothing  for  the  French.  This  was  almost a  rehearsal  for  Napoloen's  invasion  of  Russia  two  years  later  where  the  same  scorched  earth policy  would  be  employed  by  the  Russian peasants.  In  fact  the  Russians  were  likely  inspired  by  ths  effort.

This  film  is  like a pictorial  version  of  Goya's Disasaters  of  War  drawings.  It takes  the  viewer  on a  Tour-de-Force  showing  how  different  elements  of  Portugal's  populace  dealt  with  the  nightmare  of  the  3rd  major  invasion  of  their  country.  This  event  was a  landmark  in  Portugal's  history  and  is  worthy  of a film  epic  for  sure.  Unfortunately  this  one  does  not  quite  measure  up.

  John  Malkovitich  is  hopelessly  miscast  as  Wellington  in  this  film.  In 1810  he  was  41  and  in  vigorous  health!  His  portrayal  of  the  iron  Duke  is  lethargic  and  laconic!  Wellington  was  very  active  and  vigerous  in  his  command  style.  Malkovitch  shows  little  of  that  here. He  should have played  Andre  Massena's  role  instead. . This  would  have  worked  better  as  Massena  was  not happy  with  his  command,  and  his little tart  mistress in  Hussar  uniform  reflected  his  lack  of  concern.  A  good, young stiff upper  lip  Brit  could  have  played  Wellington  instead.  Think  of  Christopher  Plummer's  brilliant  portrayal  in  the  epic  film  WATERLOO.  Malkavitich  looks  like  he  is  ready  to  go  to  sleep  half  the  time!  Plus  Wellington  had  far  much  more  to  concern  himself  than a silly  painting  of  his  recent  victory  at  Busacco!  In  his  own  words  he  had  great  respect  for  Marshal  Massena  who  was  considered  The  Emperor's  Child  of  Victory for  all  his past  successes.  Wellington  never  slept  well until  Massensa  was  starved  out  and  broken  at Torres  Vadres.  This  must  have  been  a  deliberate  decision  on  the  part  of  the director  to  portrayal  Wellington  and  Massena  in  this  way.  If  so  it  was a  poor  one  and  detracts  from  the  historical  accuracy  of  the  production.

The  movie  also  does  not  show  the  extent  of  starvation  and  suffering  that  the  French  endured  for  over a  month  while  they  tried  to  figure  out a  way  to  penetrate  Torres  Vadres.  Its  almost  anti-clamatic at  the end  when  they are  shown  suddenly  gone from  their  positions.

This  is a  beautifully  produced,  if  uneven  historical work.  The  director  should  have  been  more  about  his  bussiness in  certain  very  important  details.  He  rather  misses  the  point  if  his  desire  was  to  show  how  Portugal  suffered  during  this  time.  Still  worth a  view  as  there  are  not  many  films  about this  topic  outside  of  the  rather  tongue  and  cheek  SHARPE series.",1438905600,,3822,4.88809946714032

The vignette (made for TV) format offers you a very broad view of the many classes of people caught up in the long walk to Lisbon and only a few characters are developed in any real depth.

In fact, guessing the purpose of the film to be an examination of the effects of the protracted retreat on the lives of relatively ordinary Portuguese and those others in Portugal at the time, it is as ""un"" epic as it can be.  It is interesting enough though for that tidbit of historical perspective.

5690719,4,B00C4RWYG0,"3.5/5  This historical film is set in the time of the Napoleonic Wars. The lines are Wellington's fortifications, built over 18 months to turn back the invading French.  The film is told through the eyes of numerous characters - a British major, a Portuguese sergeant, and some of those following the war - a prostitute, a mute beggar, a travelling merchant, a wealthy pair of siblings and more.

We are treated to vignettes, both past and present as Sarmiento explores war and its effects on all classes. I became caught up in many of the stories, particularly that of the mute beggar and the Portuguese sergeant. Some of them seemed awkward though, and not to belong - such as the sister of the siblings and her sexual appetites.

I didn't know much about this time period and actually learned quite a bit.

Although John Malkovitch has been given front and centre on the cover, he is really only onscreen for a small amount of time - part of that is reciting the recipe for Beef Wellington. I found it very hard to take him seriously. The other actors, none of whom I knew, were really good. As was the setting and the extras. (although their clothing seemed a little too clean for being on the road)

The film is 150 minutes long, and I ended up watching in two sittings. And honestly, my attention was starting to wander a bit. I enjoyed Lines of Wellington, but not as much as other viewers.

Here was a chance to dig deep into matters of the human heart during war (lost love, artistic expression, issues of loyalty etc) without an overload of artillery. But, the opportunity was lost. The acting was good but the plots were jumpy. Reoccurring characters were not allowed to link their stories between scenes.
