537277,3,6303046975,"This is one of the strangest looking films I can remember. The sets make this film look like a biblical soap opera gone futuristic. I am not sure if this was director Victor Saville's intent or not. Filmed in CinemaScope by William V. Skall, it just looks so offbeat.
Based on the novel by Thomas Costain, it deals with the trials and tribulations of a Greek, portrayed by Paul Newman, who designed the cup used at the Last Supper.
The cast includes Virginia Mayo, Jack Palance, Pier Angeli, Joseph Wiseman, Natalie Wood, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene and Alexander Scourby.
Franz Waxman's score and a cryptic performance by Jack Palance make this worth watching.
This is an interesting film, which certainly follows a different path.",967507200,6,732,4.911290322580645
537278,3,6303046975,"""The Silver Chalice"" was filmed in CinemaScope and starred Virginia Mayo, Jack Palance, Pier Angeli  and introduced Paul Newman to the screen.
Paul Newman took an ad out in a Hollywood trade paper, urging  people NOT to watch the movie on tv. His wishes backfired and it became the  most watched film in Los Angeles history.
Newman plays Basil who was  stripped of his fortune and exiled after his father dies, by his uncle who  is desperate for money and power.  He is raised poor and becomes a  sculpter.  He meets the almost impossible task of creating the chalice from  which Jesus drinks his last liquid, before he dies.
Virginia Mayo, one of  the most beautiful actresses of all time, plays Helena, Paul's childhood  love interest, who now, grown up, is a concubine to a deranged magician,  played by Jack Palance.
The story is similar to many biblical films.  Subjects run from Christians being tortured, revolution and  pride.
Newman's wooden performance was why he didn't want anyone to see  this, but Mayo and Palance were quite good in their roles.
Paul Newman  had some hot love scenes with Miss Mayo, who received top billing, and they  both looked great in Technicolor.",952732800,7,1183,4.8059701492537314
537279,3,6303046975,"The Silver Chalice is notorious as the movie Paul Newman publicly apologized for in an L.A. newspaper when it premiered on TV in the '60's. I am a devotee of the Hollywood epic, particularly when attempts were made to  bring biblical eras to life in the early widescreen era (1953 - mid-60's).  Speaking from my understanding of the scriptures as a Bible School  graduate, on many occasions the doctrines presented were somewhat  hit-and-miss (notable exceptions here being BEN-HUR and John Huston's THE  BIBLE which were pretty accurate in most areas),but the intentions were  generally honourable and many were inspired as well as entertained.(Studio  coffers were usually receiving ""good offerings"" too,thus the  number produced!)  Fresh on the heels of the 'ginormous' success of  Fox's THE ROBE (1953-the first CinemaScope film and the number one hit of  the year) came Warner Bros.'THE SILVER CHALICE', again based on a  best-selling novel which-inspired by a real archeological find in Antioch  of an ancient chalice with the apostles and Christ scupltured on  it-presented the fictional story of the conversion of the Greek scupltor  supposedly respopnsible for its creation. Mixing historical characters  (Simon the sorceror,Nero,Joseph of Arimathea) with fictional ones,Thomas  Costain followed in the successful footsteps of General Lew Wallace,the  author of the phenomenal best-seller of the 19th century, BEN-HUR.  Rejected for the part of Aaron in EAST OF EDEN, Paul Newman scored the lead  in this big-budget production and was so ill-at-ease in the part he  apparently turned down any further offers to do ancient-world epics or, as  he put it, do parts which require a ""cocktail dress"".Despite  this, his portrayal is fervent and contains more depth than the script  would seem to provide- the Actors Studio meets Cecil B.DeMille! Pier Angeli  (who met and fell in love with James Dean while this film was shot,he  frequently visited the set),gives a very tender and moving performance. Some  of the supporting players are a little stiff and stagey, but Jack Palance  makes a meal of Simon the Sorcerer, a part which-as written- is best played  ""over the top"".A staple of Warners epics at this stage (THE FLAME  AND THE ARROW,KING RICHARD AND THE CRUSADERS) is Virginia Mayo, still  beautiful in the last days of her screen ""hay-day"" and playing  her unsympathetic vixen with some verve. Her final scene as she is led to  her doom in the tower is one of the film's highpoints. The actor who  portrays Nero is no match for Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton, who did  brilliant portrayels in 1951 and 1932 respectively,then again in his  defence his screen time is much briefer.(The reclining at the palace  banquets is very accurate historically-this was how the Last Supper was  eaten).The misplaced reverence for the relic of the cup used at the Last  Supper (it is almost worshipped, a doctrinal flaw in THE ROBE-no such  idolatry was tolerated by the early church!) is compensated for by the  conversion scene of Newman,in which he comprehends the truth about Jesus  and is divinely assisted in creating his likeness on the chalice.  What sets this film apart and makes it worthy of re-assessment are the  stylized,almost surreal sets (which don't ALL work but make this movie  visually unlike ANY other epic) and the beautiful score by one of  Hollywood's masters :Franz Waxman (who scored REBECCA,PEYTON PLACE,A PLACE  IN THE SUN etc.) This score was, I believe,one of his personal favourites  and was Oscar-nominated. It elevates this film immeasurably. The  CinemaScope cinematography (lost on the VHS tape but seen to full advantage  on the recently released laserdisc) by William Skall was also  Oscar-nominated and a great example of early wide-screen photography (2:55  to 1).The pace is a little sluggish at times, but most religious epics  suffer from this and at least Victor Saville, the British director, is less  overstated in his direction than deMille was. A flop in its day, THE SILVER  CHALICE is not the disaster many believe it to be, but a flawed film with  much to recommend the discerning lover of Hollywood product from this  era.(Also, Natalie Wood makes one of her last pre-adult appearances as the  Virginia Mayo character as a girl- looking of course, nothing like  Virginia!)",949017600,3,4325,5.148414985590778

I once owned this movie on VHS, and I really liked the story, but the copy was not at all good quality.  First of all, no widescreen, second of all, the picture had all kinds of dust and debris that hadn't be cleaned off which resulted in a bad transfer.

We can all pretend that it is a cult classic; but do not let your mind trick you into calling a classic because it is a dismal failure.  I am reading the book and per chance happened to see that the film was available and with such a stellar cast. I seldom see so many bad reviews and I did not believe it could be so bad. I am glad I saw it for $2.99 on cable rather than purchase this film. One reviewer called it stupefyingly bad. Folks it is not even that good. I thought I was watching a high school production. Everything about this production was inept including script, staging, acting and sound track.

537805,3,6303046975,"Staking a claim for some of the massive business racked up by The Robe but falling far short of its box-office and artistic ambitions, The Silver Chalice is one of the most mocked of all Biblical epics, not least because its debuting star Paul Newman never missed an opportunity to talk it down, even taking out an advert later in his career to apologise for his performance when it played on TV. Yet the film doesn't really deserve its place in the 50 Worst Films of All Time or deliver the camp hilarity you'd expect, falling inoffensively into the last gasp of studio backlot-shot epics like Salome that would soon be replaced by cast-of-thousands shot-on-exotic-locations roadshow pictures that weren't quite so old-fashioned.

The story is fairly simple and predictable fare, with Newman's sculptor (awkwardly named Basil) being cheated out of his legacy and sold into slavery, only to be rescued by Saint Luke so that he can create a setting for the Holy Grail depicting the Apostles and the face of Christ for Joseph of Arimathea. While he is struggling for inspiration, Jack Palance's Simon the magician is graduating from creating impressive illusions with his assistant Virginia Mayo (who, as played by a blonde Natalie Wood, was Basil's childhood sweetheart) for the local Roman garrisons to posing as the Messiah to unite Joseph Wiseman's Zealots while offering some helpful tips on PR, presentation and showmanship like a turn of the millennium spin doctor. Unfortunately Simon pulls off such good illusions that he starts believing them himself, which is not a good idea when your next big trick is flying from a giant tower, while the Zealots are after the silver chalice to destroy it because the competition from the Christians is damaging their recruitment drive...

The plot's certainly as silly as The Robe and it's rather lacking in drive whenever Palance is off the screen. It doesn't really have much of an ending either and there's never really any jeopardy for Newman's character: he may take a while to reclaim his birthright, but he's not a slave for long. Indeed, everything tends to fall into his lap rather too easily to drum up much drama. Yet somehow director Victor Saville never lets it go over the top - an achievement with this kind of plotting AND Jack Palance in the cast - while taking an interesting visual approach to the material. Boris Leven's design is genuinely striking - clean straight lines, smooth surfaces and a minimum of detail or set decoration giving it a look at once expensive but simple and almost minimalist. At times it looks as if Saville was bringing a studio-shot film musical aesthetic to the Biblical epic rather than the location naturalism most of its competitors strove for. In many scenes there's no attempt to hide the fact that paintings are used, so the stylisation is clearly deliberate: a storybook style for a storybook story.

The performances are more variable. At the very beginning of his James Dean period (Warners had originally tried to convince their newest star to play the role), Newman thankfully isn't imitating his mannerisms here as he would so self-consciously in the pictures he inherited from Dean post-mortem, Somebody Up There Likes Me and The Left-Handed Gun, though he's certainly out of place in the genre. Lorne Greene is probably as miscast as Saint Peter, starting his screen career as much of it would follow by playing older than his years, though he manages not to embarrass himself. The recently departed Joseph Wiseman, an actor always at his best when underplaying but always at his most entertaining when going over the top, dials it down here despite playing what seems to be the inspiration for the Judean People's Front's crack suicide squadron, while Palance dominates much of the film by (by his standards) underplaying his strength and certainty. Instead it's left to Albert Dekker, hamming up his terrible dialogue as if doing a nightclub impersonation of Frederic March in Sign of the Cross, to cross the line into unintentional comedy.

It all adds up to a film that's never less than watchable even if it's less than riveting, throwing up enough that's interesting to repay the effort even if it's one that's unlikely to trouble the memory too much. Warner's DVD release, though sadly extras free, boasts a particularly fine widescreen and stereo transfer.",1301270400,2,4372,4.968579234972678
537806,4,6303046975,"One of the strangest films I have ever seen! This was clearly some sort of very bold and ambitious experiment -- but at what? There have been 18 previous reviews I can see why most call it a stinker. It is very non-conventional and moreover the acting is very peculiar and towards the end the whole thing seems to degenerate into a silly joke.

Yet I think this is a film that those interested in film, and especially experiments in film will want to know about and take a look at. So I give it four stars for intriguing for that sort of audience.

First of all I really like the ""surrealistic"" sets (that some called cheap and flimsy). They were a lot like opera sets and often largely symbolic and minimalist. I saw bits of this on television years ago and they really stuck in my mind. This is why I was excited to see the whole film when I finally found it. They might remind some of German expressionist sets. I liked this a lot. It made the film seem dreamy.

The acting may seem stupid, but I suspect that the director wanted the film to seem dreamy but it just did not come off for the most part. At times it did seem no more stilted than a lot of acting in opera -- but there was no singing as an excuse for being plodding!!!  Biggest mistake here in my mind was the acting. But this sort of thing is something that I admit I can't really get into very well anyway. Consider for example Dogville or Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois. Personally I find they take too much work, but are interesting nevertheless.

On the other hand the acting is actually not much ""worse"" than in many other films, it is just very odd.

Then too the acting is sometimes on a par with that in B or C religious inspirational films. Bibleman came to mind as being really corny -- for kids of course.

I find the plot interesting actually. What does Jesus have to offer that a magician cannot match? Miracles can be faked and can be in the eyes of the beholder. Can Jack Palance the magician outdo the Apostle? If he can, then Christianity is just wishful thinking. PLOT SPOILER!!!!!  -- we never get the answer!!!!!!  Palance the magician gets carried away and thinks he can fly -- and SPLAT the contest never takes place!!!

Then the ending seems to turn into a joke. It might as well be a parody of a religious film for children. It could be a joke. Or it could be they threw up their hands and said, ""how shall we end this darned thing? Whatever; lets just end it somehow with something inspirational to offset the questions we raised about the appeal of magic to the masses."" Maybe they were hoping to pitch this as a family film?  Hard to say what they might have been thinking back in the 50s.",1299456000,,2681,4.299603174603175
537807,1,6303046975,"Make absolutely no mistake about it - Paul Newman was 100% correct when he asserted that The Silver Chalice was the worst studio film of the 1950s. It is jaw-droppingly, stunningly incomprehensibly bad - perhaps the worst big-budget movie ever made in the second half of the 20th century. Of course, this does not mean that it is without its charms and its pleasures, but be warned they are not the pleasures to be found in low-budget 1950s science fiction or in poorly dubbed spaghetti westerns or kung fu epics. Instead, they are pleasures of a different sort - the pleasure of watching the relentless unfolding of a cinematic spectacle so ill-conceived, so terrible-looking, so poorly cast, and so badly plotted that you simply cannot believe what you are seeing. In fact, I find it impossible to watch the film all the way through in one continuous viewing - you simply have to turn it off now and then just get some re-grasp on reality. There is no need to go into detail about individual performances, although Virginia Mayo will absolutely flatten you. It is really the overall look, flow, and plotline of this movie that extracts the continuous gasp of disbelief. What is up with those post-apocalyptic minimalist sets out of a Kubrick nightmare? Why does the brother of the guy who adopts the young Paul Newman hate him so much, and isn't there something a little creepy in the adoption to begin with? Why is the dang cup being made in the first place? Why is Natalie Wood a platinum blonde?

Costain, and directed by Victor Saville, ""The Silver Chalice"" was one of the studio's early CinemaScope films, and was really a variation on Fox's ""The Robe,"" the first CinemaScope movie that had been a huge success in 1953... The action follows a group of Christians who are dedicated to preserving Christ's Holy Cup twenty years after the Last Supper...

Since Newman had the lead as a young Greek silversmith, sold into slavery, then chosen by the Christians to design a chalice for the Cup, becomes involved in battles and orgies, and must decide between the pagan world represented by a courtesan (Virginia Mayo) and the Christian world represented by his young, innocent wife (Pier Angeli). There is also a mad pagan magician (Jack Palance), who wants to destroy the chalice and establish his own religion, replacing Christ's miracles with black magic...

538030,4,6303046975,"That 'The Silver Chalice' is finally issued is choice news for this correspondent.

For some reason, this Warner Bros pic played in my home town months before 'The Robe' - slightly recollect that the Fox exhibitors were not quite ready with a CinemaScope screen. At any rate, the big send up for 'The Silver Chalice' entailed it being promoted as our first wide-screen experience. Little did anyone know Paul Newman from Method or Brando. Expectations regarding Virgina Mayo's performances were slight - considering her previous undemanding costumers ('Captain Horatio Hornblower;' Westerns; etc.), while Jack Palance barely was an up-and-coming young performer (cannot recall if 'The Big Knife' had come out yet).

Barely in third grade, I was blown away with the unconventional storyline for a tale set in Biblical times and the sort-of Art-Deco production values. Have not seen it since (but am all over my kids to treating me a copy for this Christmas) yet for some reason recall most of it.

Pier Angeli comes to mind, first. Saw several other performances of hers but, relatively small as her part is, could and still can appreciate James Dean's real-life endearment to her. The casting of Natalie Wood at perhaps age 12 was welcome - a favorite since 'Miracle on 34th Street' - and do believe that Russ Tamblyn was not entirely an unknown at the time. What made my head spin was for moviemakers to expect us to suspend disbelief and accept that these two characters as adults would become Mayo and Newman, respectively. It called for considerable adjustment: as if reels from two different movies had been switched.

The campy performance from Jack Palance as this flaring nostrils Jesus-wannabe cannot be faulted: it must be seen to be believed. Take his Simon seriously and you will deprive yourself of a pleasure. Think Robert Newton as Long John Silver in 'Treasure Island' (1950); Charles Laughton in 'Spartacus' or in 'Advise and Consent'; Christopher Plummer as Atahualpa in 'The Royal Hunt of the Sun' (""They eeet Him"") or as Commodus in 'The Fall of the Roman Empire""; or choice Olivier (""Is it safe?""); or a controlled Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken - and you will come close.

Lorne Greene's straighforward take on his character skewers the whole thing, actually.

No doubt Warner Bros. is releasing this film to commemorate the recent death of Paul Newman, great actor and a genuinely nice guy. However, this has got to be the worst film Newman ever starred in. In fact, Newman was so embarrassed that at some point in his career he put out an apology for his performance in the film via a newspaper ad when it was revived after he became a star. Honestly, this film really belongs in WHV's cult classics set, not as a single for unsuspecting classic movie lovers to pick up. Let me analyze what is wrong with this film. First there is the dialogue, it is over-the-top and sometimes stream-of-consciousness. Think Ed D. Wood Jr. here folks. Jack Palance gives a completely ridiculous performance as the villain, Simon, who at the end of the film tries to prove his deity by leaping from a tower to show he can fly. Gravity wins in the end. Because everyone in this film looks ridiculous - don't get me started on Virginia Mayo's makeup in this one - I have to believe this was just a unique combination of bad writing and bad direction and no oversight by the studio.

Horrible performances and direction all around except for Jack Palance as Simon the Magician: I would give the film a -100 if Palance weren't in it. Given the dialogue and direction, it's immediately evident that those involved knew little about antiquity or anything about film making in general. The horribly fake backdrops leave the impression of a bad play rather than a movie. This is the film on which Paul Newman commented that it would be his last appearance in sandals and a cocktail dress: I'd be ashamed too if I were in his place.

But all the stars are upstaged by the curious set designs.  Imagine ancient Palestine as an igloo camp designed by Buckminster Fuller.

7835036,3,6303046975,"This movie avoids a flaw found in several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah. Those movies unfortunately depicted all pagans or anybody who isn't a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent.

The Silver Chalice focuses well on the struggle and life of Basil. Meanwhile, it gives good attention to the movement that Simon the Magician is trying to build.

There really was a person named Simon Magus who challenged the ""miracles"" of Jesus. Not surprisingly, he was demonized by early Christian historians.

The main flaw with the Silver Chalice is the movie set. Many other movies of the 1950s set in ancient times made a decent effort in designing their movie sets to duplicate dwellings as they might have existed in ancient times. The Silver Chalice movie set is very plain and shows that little effort was made in that regard, especially on the roof scene set in Jerusalem where Basil and Deborra are trying to escape from the mob and the Romans.",1518566400,,1029,4.769662921348314

Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

Whoever saw through this B-movie and cast Paul Newman in his next role in Somebody Up There Likes Me deserves a medal. The Silver Chalice was Newmans first film role, after only a few television credits. He knew how stinky the movie was, so I don't feel bad in criticizing it.

In an attempt to copy the success of The Robe, another biblical epic was made. Only, instead of casting people who could actually pull off a period piece (Richard Burton and Jean Simmons), this film starred Paul Newman and Virginia Mayo. The film plays off like a bad community theater dress rehearsal, and don't even get me started on Mayos crazy eye makeup!

Save yourselves. Even if you like biblical movies, the 1950s produced so many others you can watch besides this one. Watch Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments, The Robe, or Quo Vadis. Just don't watch The Silver Chalice. Im sorry, but with the crummy script, make-up, and acting, no one wants to sit through two and a half hours about a man trying to sculpt a chalice with the faces of Jesus and his disciples on it, and a bunch of bad guys trying to steal it.",1499644800,,1153,4.480952380952381
