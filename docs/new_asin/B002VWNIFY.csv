4001714,4,B002VWNIFY,"This stage play was very interesting.. not alot of singing like other plays. Lenny Williams did an awesome job singing his wonderful hit ""Cause I Love You"" and Shirley Murdock was not short stopping with the song she sang!! Overall it's a great play to watch and have in your dvd collections.",1264377600,2,292,4.634615384615385
4001715,3,B002VWNIFY,The play is modern day love with a twist. It begins slow and picks up toward the end. Even though there are known stars in this it still has places where it lagged and the plot was very easy to figure out. But still worth looking at.,1264032000,2,233,3.978723404255319
4001744,1,B002VWNIFY,"Unfortunately, this stage play was a huge disappointment. During the first 15 minutes, black people were name-calling and degrading each other, using every ugly, negative stereotype that whites created about us.

I like comedy as much as the next person, but I am weary of watching black male buffoons and overweight, loud, domineering and violent brown and dark skinned black females. I felt like I was watching a marathon of foolishness.

There is also a lot of color-ism in this production, with the usual very educated, professional light-skinned, almost white looking black female lead. Sadly, this is very common in most independent black theater and movie productions, which seldom cast a dark-skinned black female as the love interest of a black male -- and shows an appalling lack of respect and gratitude for the most loyal supporters of black plays: black females.

Perhaps it is time sisters start voting with their wallets and lack of support until this anti-blackness and skin color prejudice changes.

If white people had created this play with all these stereotypes and black buffoonery, most blacks would be up in arms at how negatively we are being portrayed. Yet -- when a black person does the same thing to our images, we feel obligated to support them? I totally disagree with that. We are simply repeating those slave traditions that were created during the early part of the 20th century by whites where black actors in minstrel shows were bucking their eyes, acting like fools, and putting each other down.

I was reluctant to write this review as I don't enjoy publicly trashing the work of black people, but I think this is a huge problem, and felt obligated to throw in my two cents. If you decide to buy or watch this movie, keep this review in mind, and ask yourself afterwards:

why is so much black entertainment about degrading other black people? I think it's time we thought about that question.",1357084800,2,1930,4.886850152905199
4001745,4,B002VWNIFY,Well if you had some spare time. Then couldn't figure out what to watch. This movie wouldn't be your first chose. Yet if your a fan of Black plays. Its a must watch. You see where the bad acting still brings the plot with a nice smooth bang. It has some twists but needs more added. Not to mention some things taking away. I don't expect to ever see this one on the big screen. Yet it will be a play that does pass the time.,1316217600,,424,3.941860465116279
4001746,5,B002VWNIFY,This was a very good movie. I really enjoyed it. Lenny Williams is still OFF THE CHAIN...despite him being a little older.,1304294400,,122,4.590909090909091
4001747,4,B002VWNIFY,"I recently watched this play,  I thought it was very good.  They didn't over do the singing and there was a good story line.  Make you realized that everything that glitters is not gold and what you this is good can be bad; and what we thin is bad can actually be for our good. 3",1302220800,,279,3.9464285714285716
4001748,5,B002VWNIFY,"I enjoyed this play so much, I had to watch it twice in one night.
The cast is excellent and so is their performance.  Would like to see Billy Dee Williams in more plays - he was awesome and Leon was supurb as usual.  Whenever he's in a play, I automatically purchase it.",1273363200,2,271,4.09433962264151
4001749,5,B002VWNIFY,"The play was contemporary, it dealt with current issues.  Emotional, relational as well as political and spiritual.  Such as the war, fighting for justice to get the character, Uncle William his reparations.  The relationship between Chastity and Jamarcus and the impact it had on her relationship with her mother because they were not married.  Then the relationship with Chastity and Devon how misunderstanding and things unspoken that can affect a relationship.  Homeless state of William, Claretha and Jerome and the reasons why, life is not always black and white, (there for the grace of God go I/we).  And to top it off the excellent singing, the laughter in the midst.  Needless to say, I throughly enjoyed the this play.",1271203200,,729,5.07563025210084
4001750,5,B002VWNIFY,This is a  GREAT play! It will have you laughing and crying at the same time! I enjoyed this play and it is AWESOME! A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR DVD COLLECTION!,1268352000,,153,3.935483870967742
4001751,5,B002VWNIFY,"The DVD was great.  It was heartwarming,funny,and tearful. I pass it on to my dtr to watch.  I feels before anyone take that big step in life, they should watch the DVD not just for fun and laughter; but for the message that was prevailed in the movie.  Please understand that if you want your relationship to work; then you must know thyself, followed your heart,and trust in GOD to guide you in your decision.",1265932800,8,411,4.453333333333333
4001752,5,B002VWNIFY,"I bought this play a few days ago and absolutely loved it! The drama in this play is off the chain good! The singing throughout this  entire play is great! Being torn between two men for this woman was really something to see. She played that part like a champion on wheels. I don't think I could have chosen between the two elements that she had to work with based on emotion alone. Whew! And the comedy in this play is also very very good. This entire play is one that you have to sit down to really enjoy all of its perks. It has great acting in it and really nails the point to you. You have to see this at any price.
After seeing this one, I am following Je""Caryous Johnson's work from now on. I love Tyler Perry's work but this guy is great too! Check this out!",1265500800,19,767,4.079470198675497
4001753,5,B002VWNIFY,"I loved this play.  Je'Caryous Johnson has done it again.  The only problem I have is deciding if I love this play more than Friends and Lovers.  As always, Leon is fantastic as the leading man.  I enjoyed the cast and again, I loved this play!",1264464000,6,244,4.239130434782608
