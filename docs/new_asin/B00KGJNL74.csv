6425459,5,B00KGJNL74,I just bought this for my 14 year old son. he loves loves show. happy its on dvd for 15.99$!!:),1400889600,6,95,3.8
6425460,1,B00KGJNL74,"I have waited so long for a Kenan & Kel boxset to come out and this is what we get? ""Best of"" these seasons?  Is it really so much to ask to have ALL episodes from those seasons? And they're DVD-Rs!? That's right folks, burned discs, which are less scratch-resistant than an actual manufactured DVD and more prone to malfunction.

The 1990's are the golden era of Nickelodeon, and Kenan & Kel are an important part of that, and the show is worthy of better treatment than this.  We the fans want all episodes of all 4 seasons, special features, and it'd be great to include some Kenan & Kel related movies such as Good Burger, Two Heads Are Better Than None, etc...

Nickelodeon never gives their shows proper releases.  Where's Pete & Pete season 3?  What about You Can't Do That On Television, All That, KaBlam!, Eureeka's Castle, Salute Your Shorts, Weinerville etc etc etc...",1400889600,45,879,4.602564102564102

6425490,5,B00KGJNL74,"I LOVE Keenan & Kel and I am WAY PAST grown! :-) These DVD's are all that and more, and I am having a ball watching them! Some of the episodes I had forgotten about, and I am cracking up! I especially like the ""Sears Tower"" episode. These guys were so cute and funny. I wish they had gone on to make more movies together in the way of Laurel and Hardy, Abbott & Costello, because they sure had the talent. I have their movie ""Good Burger"", and isn't that the only one that was made? What a shame. Anyway, I am really enjoying these DVD's and am going to purchase seasons 3 & 4.",1451174400,,577,4.026086956521739

6425536,2,B00KGJNL74,First off I love the show but I was so disappointed. Half the episodes were cut off.,1404691200,2,84,4.0
6425537,1,B00KGJNL74,"i am highly upset this isn't all the 4 seasons as a fan of kenan and kel we are looking for the complete series of kenan and kel not the best of season 1&2 i hope that amazon does get permission from nick studios to get the complete series of kenan & kel along with the complete series of rocket power, are you afraid of the dark, and possibly the tv series of all that also as i was a huge fan and use to laugh for hours at the stunts and trouble that would get into and the spooky stories that the kids that the midnight society would tell please release all these series we have waited long enough for it sincerely matthew sims a amazon customer",1404345600,,648,4.0703125
6425538,1,B00KGJNL74,Although I love both classic Nickelodeon. And Keenan and Kell. I flat out refuse to spend my money on burnt discs. I have unfortunately had experience withe the Dvd-r formatt. And can tell you first hand that its junk. The studios basically release there product on a home made level. Rather than a professional one. And the product quallity seriously dimminishes. Its sad that Nickelodeon cant just give us the classic shows we all love. And stop goofing around. And worrying about money. How many times have they started releasing these shows. Only to stop and go back to this stupid formatt. I hope they team up with shout factory again. Bad enough its a  Dvd-r set. But also a best of collection. I seriously don't know why people go for this Dvd-r stuff.,1403740800,,759,4.664179104477612
6425539,2,B00KGJNL74,"It's well-documented here that this set is missing ""In the Line of Kenan"", ""Baggin' Saggin' Kel"", and ""Safe and Sorry"". But that, alas, is not the only issue with this long-awaited release.

To add to the disappointment, the final scenes (in front of the red curtain), and the end credits, are missing for several episodes:
""Doing Things the Hemingway""
""Mental Kelepathy""
""Duh Bomb""

Additionally, while the curtain scene and credits are intact for ""Mo' Sweater Blues"", the sixty-second blooper reel that originally followed the episode on Nick airings (as the ep ran a minute short) is missing, too.

As best I can tell, everything else is complete. All other episodes run around 24:30 (approx 24:23 ep length plus a seven-second 2014 Nickelodeon ident at the beginning of each ep), except ""Get the Kel Out of Here"" (ten seconds shorter, and it's always been that way; nothing missing here).

AV quality is also all over the place. ""Mental Kelepathy"" is from an utterly abysmal master and looks way too white. Audio levels vary ridiculously; the Nickelodeon ident each episode is preceded by is almost always much louder than the episode that follows.

As for the episodes missing altogether: ""Baggin' Saggin' Kel"" is likely not here due to the use of an LL Cool J song, but the no-show of the other episodes is less obvious. In the comments on another review I posited a theory regarding issues over guest star royalties; the final scene of ""Doing Things the Hemingway"" has two such guests, but the other missing final scenes don't have any such guests, so who knows? It's just a theory, but I haven't heard any more compelling reasons.

This is the latest in a series of disappointments relating to Amazon's MODs - just look at the recent issues with Louie S3 (playback issues) and Last Man Standing S1 (missing episode). Very frustrating. Kenan and Kel is a great show. It deserves a better release.",1401926400,30,1903,4.8580246913580245
6425540,5,B00KGJNL74,These guys are funny.  They have a great chemistry between them that just keeps everyone entertained and laughing the whole time!,1401494400,4,129,5.142857142857143
6425541,2,B00KGJNL74,"When it comes to golden-era Nickelodeon sitcoms, Kenan and Kel is a fan favorite, and for good reason. Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell had amazing chemistry here and on All That. You'd think this would get a quality DVD-9 retail release from Nickelodeon, right? Wrong!
What we get is an incomplete Season 1 (""In the Line of Kenan"", ""Safe and Sorry"" and ""Baggin' Saggin' Kel"" are not included) and Season 2 on CreateSpace burn-on-demand DVD-Rs which have a much better chance of malfunctioning and getting scratches than the typical DVDs you see in stores.
It's extremely disappointing that Nickelodeon and Viacom are releasing such an amazing program this lazily. We all know that they're perfectly capable of distributing these and clearing up any copyright issues (Specifically with ""Baggin' Saggin' Kel""), they just don't want to deal with it because it's apparently not worthy of mass-distribution if it isn't SpongeBob. It's truly a shame, and I will not be buying until these shows are released the way they should be.",1400889600,13,1024,5.06508875739645
8658451,5,B00KGJNL74,I grew up watching this show and it is still funny and hilarious.,1533254400,,65,4.076923076923077
8658452,4,B00KGJNL74,"I've seen mixed and incomplete reports about what is and is not on the set, so here's a complete and accurate list:

Episodes not on this set:
Season 1, Episode 9: In the Line of Kenan
Season 1, Episode 12: Baggin' Saggin' Kel
Season 1, Episode 13: Safe and Sorry

Episodes with missing parts:
Season 1, Episode 3: Doing Things the Hemingway (final scene with the audience is absent)
Season 1, Episode 4: Mental Kel-Epathy (final scene with the audience is absent)
Season 1, Episode 5: Duh Bomb (final scene with the audience is absent)
Season 1, Episode 6: Mo' Sweater Blues (post-credit bloopers are absent)

Otherwise, you are getting everything from the first two seasons of the show. The video quality isn't great, but that's to be expected for a low-budget show from the 1990s likely mastered on videotape. The compression levels on these discs seem reasonable and in-line with what is commonly used. I was satisfied with the video quality for every episode except ""Mental Kel-Epathy,"" which is watchable, but the brightness is way off.

The most puzzling thing to me is the missing scenes in three episodes. For each of these episodes, that includes about a minute of Kenan and Kel doing the wrap-up in front of the audience and then a the credits. These wouldn't have been cut for length, as the amount of time is trivial and later discs have the same number of episodes, but uncut. The most likely reason is likely that the tapes they were working with were damaged, but these episodes have aired so many times in the decades since that it should have been trivially easy for them to get different copies. Another possibility is that there are legal issues. Two of the three include some shots of audience members' faces, so it's possible that they couldn't locate legal waivers or something (a long shot guess).

In any case, it seems unlikely that this show will receive a physical media release other than these. I was disappointed to see these limitations of the set, but am glad to have most of these episode intact.",1529193600,2,2030,4.72316384180791

8658454,1,B00KGJNL74,"Low rating reflects the DVD quality: very poor!
