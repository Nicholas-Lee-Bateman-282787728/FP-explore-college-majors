8212342,1,B000U7CZA6,"I am reviewing this to express my deep disappointment in the video ""Paris: City of light"". I purchased this video expecting to receive a high quality video as an update from my old, low quality VHS. I had the intention to use the video to teach my french students about Paris. When I ordered the video, I chose it because it included history and was labeled from the year 2007. On watching the video, I am unhappy to see that the clips are old and of poor quality. The camera is shaky and tends to show mostly the tops of buildings. It seems as though someone used their home camera to take the videos while holding the camera in their hand. In addition, the videos are very out of date (much older than 2007) which does not illustrate that cultural of Paris and also shows several important buildings covered in scaffolding and unclean.  The sound is also of poor quality which makes the video, including the poor accents, difficult to understand. The content of the video is not too poor except for the descriptions of important people being unclear or seeming unfinished and quotes seem out of place.

I am overall disappointed with this video and will most likely not be using it again.",1386633600,,1190,4.55607476635514
8212343,4,B000U7CZA6,"I have been to Paris and will be going back. If you haven't been there yet, don't expect this video to give you any visual insight into this marvelous city. No video can, even HD quality won't help. As a way to remember and bring back those moments when you first experienced the sights of Paris in person, this video covers all the special places you remember. It beats photos, or your own videos because it captures and re-creates those moments and let's you share them again in a timeline of history. For us it gave as a ""switch"" we can turn on whenever we feel the urge to ""go back"". See Paris, you'll never regret it. Don't buy this video before you go, at this price, it is worth buying after you come home to re-live your ""Paris"". You'll remember it vividly, the video will only help to stimulate those memories !!",1291334400,4,821,4.372549019607843
8212344,1,B000U7CZA6,"When I saw the title, ""Paris, City of Light"" and it was on DVD, I envsioned an interesting documentary of various night scenes in the beautiful city of Paris.  Night because, well, why would the add, ""the city of light"", to day scenes.

In retrospect, I would have been happy to have video toured through Paris in broad daylight ... just give me scenes of PARIS!

Instead, these video FAILS in three major areas -
a) The video quality is far below average.  To be sure, it looks like it was poorly filmed in the first place with a hand held camera and subsequently over-dubbed on a scratched videotape.
b) There are very few actual scenes of Paris.  During approximately the one hour ""film"", there are maybe 8-10 minutes of video of Paris, with over half being inside (like the Rose window)
c) The misleading title.  This would have been more appropriately titled, ""Famous French People Through History"".

Hopefully this review will save at least one other prospective buyer from buying this misleading title and sub-par video.",1264032000,16,1027,4.768361581920904
8212345,3,B000U7CZA6,"I bought this after the Amazon suggestion to purchase with the London DVD since we are visiting both cities in a few weeks. The footage on this DVD is very dated, at least 20 years. The quality of the photography and the audio is extremely poor. The narration seems adequate and accurate, but I was detracted by the poor overall quality.  This was a waste of money.",1208217600,37,365,4.447761194029851
8212346,2,B000U7CZA6,"One word for the ""professionals"" who shot this footage...Tripod!

Yep, its pretty much home movie quality here, but if you want the info and don't mind the shakes...go ahead, make their day and buy one!",1122940800,,202,4.771428571428571
8212347,1,B000U7CZA6,"I purchased this video and another from this collection as a gift for my father and was sorely dissapointed.  The video quality was poor and mostly out of focus, making it impossible to enjoy.",939772800,7,192,4.647058823529412
