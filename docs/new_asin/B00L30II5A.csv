And pretty good from a director and star being held prisoner at the time. This is not an authorized release of the film... as there is not one. Picture quality and sound are poor, but that's not why you're buying Pulgasari. Enjoy!",1509235200,,394,4.984848484848484
8663502,4,B00L30II5A,"I had heard of this movie (and the infamous stories behind its production) for years but had avoided it because of all it's bad reviews. Supposedly Kim Jong-il was such a film buff and was so upset that North Korea didn't have its own Kaiju Monster to symbolize its national identity (Japan had Godzilla, South Korea had Yongary), that he kidnapped one of South Korea's leading directors and forced him to make this movie as a form pro North Korean propaganda. What he got instead was a tale of a poor oppressed populace who (with the help of a giant monster) overthrow their totalitarin dictator (who obviously represents Kim Jong-il). Cheesy special effects aside, this movie was much better than I thought it would be (I must stop avoiding movies because of bad reviews). And don't worry, this is a public domain version of this movie, you won't be supporting North Korea by buying it (one of the upsides of North Korea refusing to join in on the international copyright agreement).",1507161600,,985,4.766081871345029
8663503,3,B00L30II5A,"In the days of feudal Asia, the crops are not so good and farmers are facing a takeover by Kim Jong-un oops the self-proclaimed king (Yong-hok Pak.)

The farm Jugend become rebels and with the help of the local blacksmith physically challenges the king.

The king offers the blacksmith employment by supplying his army with weapons. Natural the blacksmith refuses. While he is imprisoned his last dying, wish is to make a revengeful iron eating Pulgasari.

Eventually the king may meet the same fate as Bambi vs Godzilla.

The big question is will any of the good guys survive?
Or will the world go to the peasants?

The film was loosely based on the legend of the Bulgasari.

The value in the movie is not the movie its self but the historical value.

On the orders of Kim Jong-il, the South Korean film director Shin Sang-ok and his wife, famous actress Choi Eun-hee, was kidnapped to North Korea.
After three years in prison, Shin was united with Choi, and the two were instructed by Kim Jong-Il to make films for him in order to gain global recognition in the film industry. After making various films for Kim Jong-Il, including Pulgasari in 1985, in 1986 Choi and Shin escaped from North Korean caretakers to a US embassy while in Vienna.

8663505,3,B00L30II5A,"""Pulgasari"" is notable for one thing and one thing only: it was made in North Korea in 1985 by a director kidnapped on the order of Kim Jong-Il.

The movie is bloated, boring, and padded, and what production values it has are thanks to Japan's Toho Studios and Kenpachiro Satsuma, who played ""Godzilla"" in the mid '80s and who here donned the Pulgasari suit. Director Shin Sang-ok (and his wife, actress Choi Eun-hee, who did not appear in this film) was kidnapped by North Korean intelligence personnel to make propaganda films for the North Koreans. Although the North Koreans intended this to be a film endorsing communism, there is an interpretation that the director intended to depict Pulgasari as communism overrunning humanity; it's also interesting that starvation of the peasantry is a theme of the film, given the actual starvation epidemic experienced under the successive Kim family rule.

I will give only the briefest of plot elements as they really don't matter as much as the film's background and themes. The film opens with cheerless starvation and a government that has confiscated all metal in the village for weapons. Much of the film is quite amateurish, though on par with some cheaper Japanese productions of the same era and ilk, with rampant overacting and very forced dialogue. After a fight to the death over a wok (Resistance is futile!), eventually a local blacksmith becomes the hero of the film. The feudal goons are ordered ""Throw him into prison and don't give him any food!"" So, in other words it's exactly like North Korea. The old man goes on a hunger strike and makes a small statue of a monster out of his rice. His daughter spills some of her blood on the creature which comes to life and immediately begins eating needles and metal scraps. It starts eating all metal, and eventually gets in the government's way by eating weapons and even interrupts a beheading by eating the scimitar to be used. As he grows into a full-sized monster Pulgasari (also known as ""Bulgasari"", apparently after the legend this was loosely based on) it becomes obvious he's not the most terrifying giant rubber-suited thing ever to grace the screen. Looking like equal parts Godzooky, Trumpy from ""Pod People"" and a bear, Pulgasari is now the defender of the village, and the villagers are preparing to do their worst against the unjust governor. I liked the training camp for bandits (or very cheap ninjas), and you know this is heading for a villagers versus army showdown on Maru mountain. The army burns the monster in what is probably the film's scariest and most genuinely effective scene, but he erupts afterwards absolutely huge like the greatest Japanese kaiju. Whats the army's plan for dealing with the menace? Dig a big hole and he'll fall in. No, really, that's it. They then set out to exorcise Pulgasari as he's possessed by the spirit of the blacksmith, you see. You thought there was overacting before? Just wait for the stupefying song and dance exorcist scene featuring the high priestess at about 1:05 into the running time. Holy smokes! Amazingly this plan works, and he gets covered by rocks.

You didn't think he was dead did you? Oh, far from it! He destroys the castle and kills the evil king (capitalism?) in a dramatic scene that left me with one big question: why does the king roll himself up into an easy-to-smoosh curtain and practically hurl himself under Pulgasari's foot? Oh, yeah, because it's quality North Korean cinema. So if Pulgasari kills capitalism figuratively, it's hard to reconcile his further metallic gluttony that's now robbing everyone of metal (including a big cannon), as he's out of control and hurting the masses more and more as time goes by (score one for crafty director Shin!) For the big conclusion the heroic blacksmith's daughter hides herself in a gong and tricks him into eating her, at which point she explains that his gluttony is unsustainable and he grants her wish and disappears from the Earth in one of the worst special effects you've ever seen. The end. (Or is it?) Now I think most people (including obviously the Kim clan) view Pulgasari and his gluttony as a metaphor for unchecked capitalism, but on a deeper level I don't discount the theory that he represents the monolithic state gone horribly amok as well, especially in light of the fact that he actually had to vanquish the odious army and government leaders earlier in the film: were they symbolic of communists, then? They must be if this is such an allegorical film. Either that or there are parts there just aren't well thought out, which certainly wouldn't be the first time in a giant rubber monster movie.

Anyway, I am by no means claiming to have inside knowledge of Shin's motives, but Kim's motives seem fairly clear. What also seems clear here is that the movie that was supposed to be such a glorious victory for North Korea and their particular brand of communism did not turn out with as unambiguous of a message as they may have wished for. I also do not claim to have a lock on all the various interpretations of this movie, but there are plenty. Judging for yourself is always the best option, and I highly encourage thoughtful consideration of this particular film among all epic-sized monster movies (along with the original ""Godzilla"", of course). This film is worth watching and I gave it three stars: viewed as just another monster movie it's boring and shoddily made, but its unique background of governmental kidnapping and propaganda make this genuinely fascinating. In the ultimate thumb in the eye to his North Korean captors, Shin and Choi went on the escape to the United States after Pulgasari was in the can. Score one for the good guys!",1473897600,2,5721,4.822810590631365
