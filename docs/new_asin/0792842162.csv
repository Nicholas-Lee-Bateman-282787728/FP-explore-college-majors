146217,5,0792842162,"Dirty Work is a classic film. One of my favorites. Norm and Artic are great as buddies who finally find their way in life; they do other people's dirty work for them as a job. Chevy Chase, Don Rickles and Chris Farley all do good in supporting roles.",1469836800,,250,4.229166666666667
146228,4,0792842162,"This is not an intellectual movie. The plot is not great.  You should just watch it to get a few laughs because it is just a silly comedy.  Jack Warden is hilaroius. Artie Lange is funny as well.  Straight man Norm MacDonald does OK.  IMDB indicates the movie was released in 1998 so quite a few years have passed.  Chris Farley died in 1997, a year before release, so his appearance in this film may be near his last.  Don Rickles makes a cameo appearance as does Adam Sandler.  Chevy Chase, another SNL alum, is another comedian in the film.  Prior to the Monk TV show, Traylor Howard poses as Norm MacDonald's love interest. Too bad we don't see her in more movies.",1469836800,,668,4.373983739837398

146230,5,0792842162,"I'm serious about my comedy, and this movie is gold. This is Norm Macdonald's fever dream of a comedy, strongly injected with his personality and style. It's rough and unpolished, but the plot holds up, and more importantly, Norm and director Bob Saget made every scene a delight. The humor is immature, but cleverly thought out. This is a great comedy film, that combines Norm's sensibilities with classic archetypes you'd find in a Marx Brothers outing.",1469750400,,455,5.0
146231,5,0792842162,"The story follows a very familiar formula, akin to the late 90's SNL/Sandler flicks.  Bumbling idiot(s), with no means, must save beloved character.  Armed with only their wit/humor & some impractical skill that they can exploit.  They'll cause some mischief, get the money to save them, beat the bad guy & get the girl.  While along the way sprinkling in some great physical humor, some of Norm's wit & a touch of crass innuendo.

Dirty Work, doesn't really reinvent much but it does showcase a lot of great comedic humor.  From stars Norm MacDonald & Artie Lang, to Chevy Chase & the late Chris Farley (his last official role - which he absolutely shines).  Don Rickles & Jack Warden lend themselves well to this movie, giving a bit of respectability to the film.  Dirty work isn't for everyone but if you are a fan of Norm (you've probably already seen this) or just a fan of dark moronic humor - you'll enjoy this.

146510,5,0792842162,"Dirty Work was released in 1998,directed by Bob Saget(Full House).Dirty Work stars Norm Macdonald,Artie Lange,Jack Warden, Traylor Howard,Christopher McDonald,Chevy Chase,John Goodman,Gary Coleman,Chris Farley and Adam Sandler.

Two best friends Mitch Weaver and Sam Mckenna need to come up for Sam's dads surgery. It cost 50,000 to get a heart transplant. They have about a week to get it. Sam and Mitch open up a revenge for hire bussiness known as Dirty Work. They do all kinds of revenge jobs for money like shaving the beard off a circus lady,putting popcorn in a car,putting dead fish in a mobster's house. When their job goes a little bit too far. They get the attention of a real estate mogul,Travis Cole(Mcdonald),then he sets them up and tells them that he needs an apartment complex to be condemned so the residents can evacuate the building. After they have been setup and lied to,they decide to get back at Travis Cole and get what he deserves.

This is one of the funniest pg-13 movies from the 90s.with cheesy humor from physical to funny lines. This was one of Chris Farley's last roles before he passed away of the victim of a Saigon prostitute. Gary Coleman appears in the brownie trip scenes where he appears to be in hell with the devil played by Adam Sandler,which he has a very quick cameo. Jack Warden is hilarious playing Artie's son,being a dirty old man and a not crap taker from people.definitely worth a watch and you will likely enjoy it.very cheap movie of a bout a 10 million budget.

I also dug Norm's guest appearance as Chubby Junior on ""My Name Is Earl"" where he played the son of Burt Reynolds' strip club owner.  Though far from uninspired ""Dirty Work"" isn't what I would call classic comedy but it get's by on the good vibes that Norm emits.  Norm's style of humor I would characterize as droll though some would call it smarmy.  Regardless, the success or failure of the film falls on your reaction to Norm and he's alright by me.  Great supporting cast led by Artie Lange as Norm's best bud, Jack Warden as Lange's father, Chevy Chase as a gambling addicted surgeon, and the late Chris Farley in an extended cameo as a guy who gets part of his nose bit off by a Vietnamese hooker.

the jokes are top notch - norm has a wicked comedic delivery, and he usually ends up stealing the scene from castmember/friend artie lange, and from everyone else too for that matter (though chris farley gave him a good run for his money). if you enjoy the humor of shows like ""strangers with candy"" and ""mr. show,"" you should love this film. don't miss it",1299369600,,611,4.455357142857143

So if you are looking for a decent comedy to show off your new HD home theatre system and truly want to see how good upscaling can look then I recommend this.

The jokes are plentiful, though only a few are ""laugh out loud"" funny.  Many of Norm Macdonald's attempts at humor fall flat, and this was the biggest flaw of the film.  Norm Macdonald quite simply is not a good actor, at least not in a leading role.  To say he doesn't have much charisma is putting it mildly.  The wooden SNL alumnus delivers many of his lines like he's reading from a book or in a sarcastic tone that seems to wink at the audience when the role calls for him to play the material straight.  I love dry, deadpan humor, but Macdonald doesn't quite pull it off.  This movie might have been 5-star hilarious with Leslie Nielson the king of deadpan starring in his prime.",1161129600,,823,4.476510067114094
146582,5,0792842162,"This movie is obviously meant for the 16 - 40 year old white male demographic, and anyone outside of that group may not care for it because, just like ""Darma & Greg"" is tailored to lame people with no sense of humor, ""Dirty Work"" is tailored to people who appreciate amazing comedy -- i.e., me.

I can honestly say that this is my favorite comedy of all time.  It's best watched after a couple of beers, and there are only a few fleeting moments when the movie is not entirely on fire.  Norm MacDonald's comedic genius is fully realized in ""Dirty Work,"" without the corporate filters of Saturday Night Live or ""The Norm Show"" to mute parts of his act that would otherwise be solid gold.  If you have seen ""Screwed"" or any other movie with Norm in it, completely forget what you saw, because this movie is pure, concentrated, unedited Norm where those movies were obviously edited and ""noted up"" by executives trying to turn a profit.

Not only does Norm deliver a flawless performance, but Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, Artie Lange, Jack Warden and many others (including cameos by Gary Coleman and Adam Sandler) all hold their own and win over each and every scene in which they appear -- this isn't the typical case where a comedy movie tries to work in a bunch of celebrity cameos ""just because"" and all their performances are sad and lame.  Every comedian listed above, especially Farley, is at the very pinnacle of their game in this movie.

146583,4,0792842162,"None of the three young stars of this film - Norm MacDonald, Artie Lange or Traylor Howard - ever became movie stars but they combined to make this a funny film, albeit what I call a lame-brain (somewhat low-class but effective humor) one.

This is not an untypical comedy of today: tons of sleazy jokes, sightgags, a lightweight romance story, a generally stupid story and a happy ending.....yet this one was far more appealing than most I've seen....and the more I watch it, the more I like it!

MacDonald is a very likable guy in the lead. He just has a friendly face and demeanor about him. He makes the film. Lange was a bit loud. I'm glad the film wasn't longer because Lange's constant shouting begins to become grating. As for Traylor, she acted well and was a pretty face. After watching this twice, I wondered why she never made it, but at least she has now found TV fame as the new partner of the hit TV series, ""Monk.""

Two veterans actors in here - Jack Warden and Chevy Chase - play irreverent sleazy roles, something they certainly have done before.....and do well. Warden is brutal as the ultimate dirty old man and Chase is as smug as always. Don Rickles makes a short appearances as his normal obnoxious character and John Goodman makes a cameo near the end.

The main story of this movie is a familiar one: revenge, but this time it is played strictly for laughs, and there are plenty. The movie shows revenge isn't just sweet, it can funny.

146609,4,0792842162,"DIRTY WORK sets out what it accomplishes and that is to entertain on an uncomplicated low denominator level. Norm MacDonald (Mitch) and Arte Lange (Sam)--(SNL meets MAD TV)-- are two losers who open up a revenge-for-hire business in order to raise money for Sam's Dad (Jack Warden) who needs a heart transplant. This sets up several gags as people hire these guys for various pranks most of which are hilarious (shaving the evil ""Beared Lady"" at a carnival sideshow hired by a jilted ""little person""). This leads up to the main plot of an evil real estate developer Cole (Chris McDonald-HAPPY GILMORE) who hires the pranksters to do his 'dirty work' to have a building condemned.  Realising, that they may hurt the very people they're trying to fight for, they must undo their destruction. Norm MacDonald's SNL persona is evident here as he uses some of his dead-pan, understated schtick he used during his tenure on the show especially when he did the Weekend Update segments (i.e. ""Note to Self.."" etc). This is helped by the casting of Arte Lange who had his moments on Mad-TV and is now one of Howard Stern's posse on Stern's syndicated radio show. Lastly, the movie has some funny cameos to help the plot along (John Goodman, Chevy Chase, Chris Farley, Gary Coleman and Adam Sandler and Don Rickles) along with love interest played by Traylor Howard (who seems to be on a failed TV pilot a few times during a televison season) as Kathy.  Overall, sophomoric and low brow on a very hilarious level. Note: Classic line as Mitch and Sam are in a bar fight. Mitch (MacDonald) takes out his pocket recorder after getting beat up and say's ""Note to self...Learn how to fight!""",1096588800,13,1675,4.732876712328767
146610,5,0792842162,"Of course the term ""Norm Macdonald classic"" may seem like kind of an oxymoron, since he really hasn't been in enough films to necessitate the term ""classic"" for any of them, but the idea still remains. That is, if there is one and only one flick that can be defined as a Norm Macdonald classic, then Dirty Work is it.

We follow Norm Macdonald, and Artie Lang through various misadventures as they run their own ""business"" created especially for the purpose of ""getting back at people."" There are numerous humorous (rhyme intended) scenes throughout, as well as obscure cameos by several veteran comedic actors from SNL and other classic comedy shows. All the standard Norm Macdonald character cliches are there. Chevey Chase plays the misfit doctor who suffers from compulsive gambling habits. Jack Warden portrays the impotent old fart father of Artie Lang who also just happens to be the father of Norm, as well. Don Rickles makes a cameo appearance as a disgruntled movie theater manager, rattling off his trademark insults at his entire staff along the way. The renowned Christopher Mcdonald pulls off yet another one of his infamous scumbag roles as the tyrannical billionaire who exploits Norm Macdonald and Artie Lang's enterprise. Chris Farley also loans his talent as a degenerate barfly who lost half his nose to the teeth of a Saigon prostitute. And who could forget Adam Sandler's standout scene as Satin, opposite the often neglected, but always interesting Gary Coleman? This is just a handful of the numerous talents that work together to make Dirty Work great, but as is often the case, this film escaped the notice of the critics far and wide in most areas, and simply bred their contempt in others, but since when do Norm fans listen to the critics, anyway, am I right?

So, buy this DVD damn it, and give Norm your undying support. Lord knows, he needs it. He's had a rough couple of years.

146614,5,0792842162,"Norm MacDonald is just plain hilarious.  I've been a fan of his since back in the old SNL days, and this is his masterpiece.  The story centers around Norm and his best friend (Artie Lang) needing to get $50,000 for Artie's father to get a heart transplant.  After several failed attempts at earning the money from regular jobs, they decide to open up a revenge for hire business and hilarity ensues.  This movie also features brief appearances by Chevy Chase, Adam Sandler, Gary Coleman, and Chris Farley.  If you are at all a fan of Norm MacDonald or just comedies in general, I would highly recommend this comic masterpiece.",1073520000,2,627,4.715596330275229

I don't know if so many people know about it, but it's defintely one of the top five funniest movies I've ever seen. I think if you like Top Secret, you might like this.",1058313600,,295,3.933333333333333
146616,5,0792842162,"Looking for that crude, raunchy, extremely funny comedy to fill the void that is your life?  Well, look no further, pard!  While I missed this in the theaters (probably because it was so unmercifully panned), I was really pleased to find out my money wasn't wasted on purchasing this DVD.

Norm MacDonald stars as Mitch Weaver, a guy who just can't seem to find his calling in life.  After losing yet another menial job, his girlfriend kicks him out, throwing all his stuff out of the apartment window into the street.  Mitch goes to stay with his best friend Sam (Artie Lange) and we soon learn that Sam's dad, played by Jack Warden, has a bad heart and unless Sam can come up with $50,000 in a relatively short amount of time, his dad will die.  Mitch agrees to help Sam, as not only is Sam his friend, but Sam's dad was like a father to Mitch while he was growing up, due to the fact that his real father wasn't around.  After some hilarious attempts to raise cash, Mitch stumbles on an idea for a business by accident.  Seems Mitch has a real flair for getting back at people who step on him, so he decides to open a revenge for hire business, Dirty Work, to help those who can't help themselves, for a fee, of course.  The scene where they're hire to deal with a noisy neighbor had my friends and I rolling on the floor.  The business isn't going well, until they get commissioned by Travis Cole (Christopher McDonald) to trash a property in order to condemn it, to which they'll get a large sum of money.  Thing is, they do the work, but find out that Cole misrepresented his reasons for wanting the property condemned, and they soon find out they made a big mistake, and now Cole stiffs them on the payment.  This sets up the ultimate revenge plan, leading to a great payoff.

Look for Chevy Chase, Don Rickles, and Gary Coleman in small but funny roles.  Also in this movie is the late Chris Farley, who is about as funny as I've ever seen him.  I was surprised to learn that this movie was directed by Bob Saget, you know, the guy from that Full House TV show?  If you liked movies like Kingpin, Dumb and Dumber, or Happy Gilmore, then you'll get a kick out of this one.",1056499200,36,2179,4.330049261083744

Now that thats over with, I'd like to say Norm Macdonald is extremely funny in his first starring role. This movie could have easly benn terrible with a plot of two friends starting a revenge bussiness, but there is great acting, good directing and very funny one liners. Norm is alongside Artie Lange, Chevy Chase, and Chris Farley who gives a hillarious funal appearance in this movie (he died before it came out). The movie is also Produced by Billy Madison producer Brad Grey. If your a fan of Chris or Norm see this movie, even if you don't like them you might like this one.",1045008000,,741,4.537313432835821

I've seen this movie several times, and I never get sick of it.  It is ridiculous, but hilarious.  The jail scene is quite possibly one of the funniest scenes of all time.  Notice how he's in there just long enough to have the unfortunate experience he does.  I could go on and on about funny scenes and lines in this movie, but just trust me and go see it for yourself.

It follows the life of Mitch Weaver (Norm Macdonald) from a young age, all the way to adulthood.  Throughout, there are tons of humurous pranks, and ancidotes.  I see a new thing almost everytime I watch it.  This is the perfect movie if you and your friends are in that sit down and laugh mood.  I know because I've done that with the same friends 4 or 5 times and they still look forward to doing it again.

The reason that I gave the DVD 3 stars is for the simple lack of features.  Much like Happy Gilmore on DVD, the movie is great, but the extras are just lame.  I just want to make it clear one final time that I thought that this movie rocked.. if you want a great movie that will have you laughing out loud then look no further than Dirty Work; but if you are looking for a great DVD with lots of extras this may not be for you.",1018224000,2,591,3.9
146633,5,0792842162,"Norm MacDonald is definitely one of the funniest comics around.  His dry sense of humor always leaves me in stiches!
The basic storyline is as follows:  Pops (Jack Warden), the father of Mitch Weaver's (Norm) best friend Sam (Artie Lange) has a heart attack and needs $50k for an operation to save his life.  To raise the money, Mitch and Sam create their own ""dirty work"" business - they are basically pranksters for hire.  One of their pranks involves hiding rotting fish in a noisy neighbor's apartment.  It's uproarious!!!
My favorite scene is where Pops is watching TV and Sam and Mitch are in another room whispering to each other.  Mitch whispers that he doesn't want to look after Pops because Pops is ""creepy.""  Anyway, Sam convinces Mitch to watch TV on a couch with Pops.  After Mitch sits down, Pops attacks Mitch for calling him ""creepy.""  Pops heard what Mitch had whispered!  My description does not do that scene justice.  Watch it for yourself!  It's hilarious!!!
Don Rickels also makes a cameo appearance in this movie as the manager of a movie theatre.  His rude comments may cause you to pass out from laughter!!!

It was three years old, but it had a great cast of characters, many from Saturday Night Live, and what looked like a good plot line (Two guys open a revenge-for-hire business to raise money for their father's heart transplant), so we decided to rent it.  And I am so glad we did!  This movie was so funny and had so many catchy lines.  You will laugh at all the times Norm McDonald (who was a great and very funny actor in this movie) says ""Note to Self"" about so many different things, and at the funny antics he does with his best friend to help people get back at others.  This movie is refreshingly funny and just plain fun.  It is older and rather hard to find because of that, but it is well worth the effort of hunting it down in a video store.  It is also worth the money to just buy it here at Amazon and have a copy to rewatch and relaugh at. :)  I definitely recommend this comical movie to anyone who likes that genre.",972086400,,1096,4.06046511627907

The funny parts of the movie are truly funny, unlike  most newer comedies.  But don't be misled by the phrase ""funny  PARTS"" every scene has some kind of joke in them, even the most  serious parts of the movie will still keep you laughing!
The actual plot  is also creative, which is something lacking in most comedies today, which  all rip each other off.  The main characters have to raise 50 grand in  order to get their father on top of the list to get a heart transplant.  After a few failed attempts at traditional work, they get the idea to open  their own ""Revenge for Hire"" business.  From there the movie is  just laugh after laugh after laugh (and it is during that too).
