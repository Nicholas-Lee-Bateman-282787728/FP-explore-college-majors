It was the third and final film that we almost didn't stay to see.

Very memorable story.  I've searched for it many times and it appears that it's never been released on dvd.",1279152000,4,230,4.204545454545454
8254063,1,B00142F6P2,"This tape is of the lowest quality, recorded in SLP-mode. Don't expect any video fidelity whatsoever. I'm telling you this so you won't believe to be a 5 star movie that another person thinks it is. If HBO showed this it must have stood for Horrible Boring Office instead. This is a grade C movie that is barely watchable because of its poor sound and picture quality. The manufacturer should be ashamed. Also note that the 5 star review is the only review the other person has done. Maybe he's one of the sellers.",1254268800,6,514,4.4787234042553195
