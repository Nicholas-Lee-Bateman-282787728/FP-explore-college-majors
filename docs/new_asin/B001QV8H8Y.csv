8336496,5,B001QV8H8Y,Very nicely done! My 4-year-old loves it! Neal's voice is a wonderful unexpected bonus to the magnificent storyline. I'm glad I did not give much credence to the 1-star review.,1485734400,,176,4.9
8336497,4,B001QV8H8Y,"I am a huge fan of Neale's work, and was pleased to see this film available for younger audiences with Neale's fantastic teachings about physical and spiritual life. The film can easily be appreciated by the young and old, as there are many important messages in it that all of us could use some reminding about on a regular basis. There is also a section outside of the animation from Neale himself directed specifically to adults about some of the topics covered.

Whether the film portrays all of the ""right"" messages, or animations will be very dependent on each person's philosophies about various topics that deal with life, death and the spiritual side of things. There are many ways to approach the same situation, and not one of us can ever judge what is right or wrong to do for another. What can be guaranteed about this film, is that it presents several important themes that can provide for great family dialogues where the parents can provide their personal input and along with the children come up with ideas and solutions to similar situations in their lives that would be most in alignment with their personal beliefs.

Overall, a great film that provides an animation for youngsters with some messages about the bigger picture of life in a cute, colorful and fun way.",1366675200,,1286,4.762331838565022
8336498,1,B001QV8H8Y,"I was excited to get this DVD to show to my son (and to watch it myself!)

We have the Little Soul and the Sun book, and have benefitted greatly from the wisdom of Neale Donald Walsch (in fact, he's a fellow Hampton Roads author).

The CGI graphics aren't bad at all on the DVD and the animation is bookended by a brief introduction by Neale, and then a 30-minute follow-up discussion.

I was surprised when, early on in the story, there was a ""flashback"" of the little boy, Max, and the school bully, Karl, in a Wild West showdown where guns are fired (unexpectedly and scarily), they die, and their spirits rise up. Because I'm familiar with the message, I knew it was referring to a past life where they were rivals. But this wasn't explained as the mother was describing a simplified idea to her son, Max, in order to help him cope with the bully.

What REALLY bothered both me and my husband (OK, angered) is that when it came time for Max to forgive Karl for shoving him around repeatedly in an empty bus, pushing him into the controls, resulting in the bus hurtling down a bumpy road--that Max outright LIED to the school teacher. She asks, specifically, ""Karl, were you getting in trouble again?"" (paraphrase).

Classmates gather around at the spectacle (they saw the whole bus accident), looking angrily at Karl. Max then steps forward and LIES to the teacher, saying ""No, he didn't do anything. It was just an accident.""

Since WHEN does forgivness entail interfering in someone else's karma--the consequences for their action--ESPECIALLY in the form of lying?! I mean, Karl is then grateful, later asking Max why he covered for him and Max replies mushily ""Because I forgive you"".

GAG

You have GOT to be kidding? What kind of message is this to send to kids? My 11-year old recognized that you don't LIE to get out of trouble (for yourself or anyone else) and we had to talk him through some of the message.

I don't understand why Neale didn't demand that part to be redone. Outright lying and covering for bullies isn't ""forgiveness"", it's stupidity. And it's a bad message to send to kids on many levels--including the idea that forgivness equals staying silent in the face of aggression or violence.

You can forgive a person, even recognize they are playing a pre-incarnated ""script"" with you for your soul's higher purpose, but that doesn't mean you lie for them and help shield them from consequences!

By all means get the book of the same name...but I'd avoid getting the DVD.
