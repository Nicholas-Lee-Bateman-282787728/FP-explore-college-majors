Of course by today's standards it's old and corny, but I still loved it-If I could find a better quality DVD I would buy it.

8265338,4,B00176X7L0,"Basically, ""Beast From Haunted Cave"" is a weak, unoriginal heist story with a cheesy monster thrown in to make in marketable, if just to kids and teens in the late 50's. Yet, there's something about it I've always liked. Although I don't remember seeing it when it came out, or on TV in the 60's, it's just the kind of movie my friends and I loved...monster movies...any and all monster movies. I found it about 10 years ago in a multi pack of public domain sci-fi and horror movies. I've watched it many times since for it's nostalgic charm.

It works as well as it does because the characters and the dialogue are fairly interesting, and the monster adds a special ingredient...cheeze. The horror is not well integrated into the crime story, but for those who enjoy 50's and 60's cheeze, that's not a deal breaker.

Produced by Roger Corman's little brother Gene, I prefer this film to most of Rogers movies from this era.
