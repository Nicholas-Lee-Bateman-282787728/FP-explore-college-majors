8143549,5,B000I2JTCK,"I enjoyed both of these movies - for once (twice, actually) animal films which don't consist of animals eating other animals. Ok, some wiseass is going to say ""But it's part of life"". Ok, you can have animals killings when the studio includes clips of animals dropping a load or making nookie with another animal. Closeup. With narration. Slowmo.

*** SPOILER ALERT ***
March of the Penguins was sad when the penguin that started late was shown marching alone and it was clear he wouldn't make it. Also, the futility of the penguin(s) who allowed their eggs to touch the ground and freeze; the penguin knew what happened but didn't quite understand.

Duma was very believable when the cheetah showed up looking for the boy. No slapstick, screaming women, police with guns, etc. When Duma's time to return to the wild comes, it is sad but not overplayed. Duma knows, as does the boy, that it's time to return to where he belongs.",1448496000,,928,4.6871165644171775
