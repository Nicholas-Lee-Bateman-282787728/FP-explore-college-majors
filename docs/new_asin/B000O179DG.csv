2788809,4,B000O179DG,"I found the screening I attended of this over-sexed horror comedy immensely entertaining.  Once again the fright-fan in me was a' mighty pleased with Lance Dreesen & Clint Hutchison's creation; the flick proves to be even more irreverent than their debut genre outing TERROR TRACT.  Blood flies.  Boobs bounce.  Plot twists prompt gleeful, ""Did I just see what I thought I saw?"" exclamations.  The laughs compliment the carnage.

H & D created yet another solid B horror film, a flick that works concurrently on several layers and keeps the audience happily engaged, and most importantly (for me) a film that eschews the current trend in 'torture-porn;' BIG BAD WOLF's aim is more to create a blood-soaked B roller-coaster full of hot naked girls than a grim, socio-political slaughter-fest, and it succeeds.

Strong sexual content and adult language as well as some serious violence. with some way cool music. I've watched it twice.

2788831,4,B000O179DG,"Definitely Freddy Krueger as a werewolf. Admittedly, this was a total geek watch. I love Halloweentown, so when I looked on IMDB to see if Kimberly J. Brown did anything else and I found this, I had to see it! When I saw that Richard Tyson, who was great in Kindergarten Cop, I definitely had to see it. When I checked the Parent's Guide on IMDB for what we all want in a werewolf movie, I couldn't resist!!! This would certainly go down as a recommend to anyone that likes anything I previously mentioned. The gore was some kind of fantastic SPOILER ALERT when he ripped off Charlie's head with the pun, I howled with laughter. I'd watch a sequel to this in a heartbeat!",1479081600,6,671,4.376

2788833,4,B000O179DG,"Six dreary punks head for an isolated cabin in the woods.  Only two leave in one piece.  They tell the police that some animal killed the other four and no one disputes the claim.  The two survivors (Derek & Sam) suspect Dereks EVIL stepfather is a werewolf but cant prove it.  Dereks uncle shows up to help them sleuth.  His suspicions are verified first hand when the werewolf rips his head off.  Now its up to Derek & Sam to find a way to defeat the evil monster.

This movie follows the oft-used formula of trapping a group of teens in a building and picking them off one at a time.  In this case, they do it twice when a second group arrives at the cabin and gets caught in the crossfire.  The novelty here is the werewolf is a chatty fellow.  He taunts.  He laughs.  He tells them what hes going to do to them and then does it and gloats.  Some might find this annoying or stupid; I thought it was ridiculously hilarious.  Its unexpected.  Not exactly original, but unexpected.  Usually werewolves haven't much to say when they have wolf-ed out.  And with plenty of nudity and sex, theres also a high level of raunchiness.  This wolf is vulgar and unrepentant.  There is no Lon Chaney Jr. angst involved the day after.",1477008000,,1224,4.383928571428571

The only thing I thought that pretty much made sense, as far as our furry Lycan friends go, is the fact that it still wore it's pants after the transformation.  Never could quite understand how other Lycans never had a shred of their clothes left on, of course unless they stripped naked first.  But, right in the heat of the moment of uncontrollable transformation?  Naaaaahhh.  And, dig this.....this talking Lycan was a nympho.

Not while he was wolfed out mind you. But the wolf does pop a cherry from the backside. Spoiled it for the eager boyfriend who just needed to put a ring on his girls finger to get some of that. Werewolf didn't need a ring, just being a werewolf was enough. This is not all humor though. There is a lot of killing, blood and screaming girls and scared shi%less boys. Richard Tyson is in this movie and if you know anything about Tyson, you know he plays a great bad guy. He is at his best in this movie.

Seven years later, mom (Sarah Aldrich) has remarried to Mitchell (Richard Tyson). Derek is pledging a fraternity, one that has him take his biker chick friend Samantha (Kimberly J. Brown) to the proverbial cabin in the woods with two movie typical college couples.

We already know it is a werewolf coming at us, no need to guess or a spinner. What we do find out is that this werewolf speaks, spouting out those ""Freddie-esque"" one liners. The film is linear with no twists. Derek (Trevor Duke-Moretz) was a very straight character and outside of some moments by Samantha, the characters were drab. Her relationship with Derek is, ""I care about you more than any man I ever slept with.""

The film has some good scenes such as the opening sequence when the guide announced, ""We are being hunted."" Unfortunately they didn't stretch out the good scenes.

2789055,5,B000O179DG,"*** This review contains mild plot spoilers ***

""Big Bad Wolf"" (2006) indeed ranks with the best werewolf flicks. I wasn't so sure during the first half hour, which involves a group of college teens going out to a desolate cabin to party. The bulk of the group are unlikable frat trash and the film goes over-the-top with the gore, nudity and naughtiness as a werewolf attacks. There's also a semi-campy vibe that prevents the viewer from taking the material seriously; as such, it's thrilling, but not really scary.

Like other viewers, I was surprised to see the cabin angle of the story end by the close of the first act. The typical horror flick would use this for the entire plot. I was like, ""Where are they going to go from here?"" Well, the two survivors start to suspect who the werewolf may be and join-up with someone else to end the werewolf's reign of terror.

Despite the above negatives, everything comes together for an excellent werewolf flick. It all makes sense if you stick with it. For instance, why are Derek, the nerd, and Sam, the mechanic biyatch, the only two survivors of the original group? Sam comes off too-gruff at first, and it's a turn-off, but then it becomes clear that she was just able to see through the fakeness and superficiality of the frat trash and refused to take their sheet. Derek's the likable protagonist who's uncertain, but rises to the challenge when necessary. I found myself caring about these two and their potential relationship as the story progressed.

After the first act, the movie becomes reminiscent of ""Fright Night"" in that it involves two teens -- a male and a female -- who suspect someone in the neighborhood of being a monster and hooking up with an older individual to take down the creature. Whereas ""Big Bad Wolf"" shares similarities to ""Fright Night"", 2008's ""Never Cry Werewolf"" wholesalely rips it off, just substituting a werewolf for a vampire (still, it's a really good werewolf flick).

What impressed me with ""Fright Night"" was the hideousness and wickedness of the vampire; ""Big Bad Wolf"" does the same thing with the werewolf, but ups the ante. More than that, the werewolf retains the intelligence of the man to a large degree and can talk, which is an interesting addition to werewolf lore. It also makes the creature more interesting. Even more, they give dimension to the man who's infected by the werewolf curse. Later in the story it becomes clear that he WAS trying to keep himself from harming people when the full moon came. Yet this is contrasted by his basking in the curse whenever he becomes the werewolf. Good writing and attention to detail like this propels ""Big Bad Wolf"" to the head of the pack.

There's a rockin' soundtrack and an an excellent number that plays during the end credits, ""Shelter"" by Green Vinyl Dream.

I should stress that this is a hard R-rated film with some very crude moments, mainly because the werewolf is thoroughly evil and some of the youths are frat trash, but if you can look beneath its gruff exterior it's got a good heart and is a worthwhile experience.

The film was shot in Semi Valley and Los Angeles, California, and runs 95 minutes.

2789056,2,B000O179DG,"The plot wasn't horrible, nor were the production values or the acting.  This could have been a decent, fun little b-horror flick.  Could have been - but for some reason they decided they needed to throw in random acts of sexual violence.  From an on-screen rape, to a forced oral encounter, to the off-screen sounds of what has to be a second rape...  There was absolutely no reason that these needed to be included.  If I had known that even one of these happened in this movie, I would never have bought it.  So, if, like me, you purposefully avoid movies that depict rape, watch out for this one.

2789067,5,B000O179DG,"As a hardcore horror fan, i have pretty much seen every obscure & rare horror film, ranging from slasher flicks, to early noir, 50's sci-fi & classic/gothic, and as such, i have ran into a few werewolf flicks in my day, my top picks being the Howling, Wolf-Man (both versions), Silver Bullet, the Naschy films, an American werewolf in london & now this film, which i seen totally by accident, late one night on tv, and what a pleasent surprise it was, i was expecting your typical, non-interesting, 90's-type low budget, slasher-monster flick, however, once i noticed Kim J Brown form the Halloweentown movies in it, i knew this might have a little more to it, so i decided to stay up & watch it, and boy am i glad. Richard Tyson plays the werewolf (aswell as his human form) & is just fantastic, his preformance as the wolf kinda reminded me of Freddy Krueger (full of sick puns), and his part in human form is just as entertaining (in my opion, Mr. Jackson, and Ms. Brown for that matter, are grossly over-looked talents).

While there is some minor ""amature"" acting in the werewolf's teen victims, i found nothing really to complain about (what do you expect from a film like this, Scream?), and like i said before Tyson & Brown more than make up for any faults (as does the fx). The direction was ok (as was the audio commentary, needed more special features though), and the gore was great! take it from a giallo film freak, this film delivers (in a Hatchet & 2001 Maniacs kind of way). There was just 1 cgi transformation though, and i could have lived without it, but that's really minor. Overall it's a great little low budget horror-black comedy film, well worth the buy for any collection or just to watch.",1346198400,8,1716,4.553398058252427

2789071,5,B000O179DG,"I must admit, Big Bad Wolf was a pleasant surprise.  What I initially believed was going to be a by the books horror flick, actually turned out to be a remarkably well told storyline-driven delight.  It's about (of course) a man who turns into a werewolf whenever there's a full moon.  This werewolf is muscle toned, fearless, pure evil and kills teenagers in graphic fashion.  However the storyline is definitely something that shouldn't be overlooked.

The reason I keep bringing up the storyline is simple- it quickly takes a very differnet turn that I didn't see coming.  Let's be honest, in the beginning when a group of teenagers take off into the deep part of the forest and spend the night in a cabin, it seemed very obvious that the storyline would be based around one familiar overused formula- teens get drunk, teens party, teens have some frisky and exciting fun, werewolf sneaks around and kills the teens one by one, one teen manages to free him or herself and heroically saves the day.  However... no!  That's not what happens at all!

Instead the movie writers went the *smart* route and allowed the cabin incident to be a very small portion of the overall story in order to avoid any predictable writing.  That's definitely commendable in my book.  As soon as a select few teens break free from the cabin, this is actually when the film begins for me.  Now it's about ""Who IS the werewolf, and how do we stop him?"" while introducing a few new characters.

I must say, the biker chick was my favorite character because of her cool, rebellious personality.  I did like the shy, somewhat introverted blonde-haired teen as well (the main character).  The two of them being friends was actually the ultimate team because they were drastically different from each other.  It made for contrasting surprises that I really admired.

Overall, Big Bad Wolf is awesome.  I highly recommend it to all horror fans.  The graphic violence is pretty extreme I admit (that normally focuses on body parts being ripped apart) but you can tell it's all really cheesy anyway so you can't actually get frightened by any of it by this point (well, unless you've been living under a rock and haven't been exposed to very many horror films in your lifetime).  This wolf is going to huff and puff and blow your expectations out of the water.",1332374400,7,2331,4.708641975308642

2789074,3,B000O179DG,"After reading most reviews for Big Bad Wolf it was clear we had a real crapfest on our hands. Now for us that's a selling point letting us know we may have a real B gem on our hands, and when you sprinkle in Clint Howard it becomes an absolute ""sign me up for one of those!"" no questions asked. See for us Clint happens to be one of the pioneers to the weird looking brother of a famous actor genre. The guy's right up there with Don Swayze! He absolutely blew our mind in the 1995 release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-Cream-Man/dp/B0002T7YNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice Cream Man</a>&nbsp;leaving us on a mission the explore the Clint Howard market. Unfortunately Big Bad Wolf used Clint's renowned name like a bunch of good for nothing tricksters since he was only in it for 5 mins. That was a bit of a let down being that we convinced ourselves he was going to be the wolfman. However the film turned out to be very hilarious and earned itself a solid 3 star rating despite a large lack of Clint.

Big Bad Wolf kicks off with a real Mary named Derek whose set on earning his way into a Frat. He has to do so by impressing Ashton Kutcher's brother Duechton Kutcher, some other pud, and two stereotypical loose horror movie chicks by bringing them to his step dad's cabin far in the woods. On the way they stop to ask directions from a Mr. Clint Howard who sternly warns them not to go into those woods. Since they don't take the wisdom of the almighty Clint they get themselves into trouble when they run into a very horny/violent werewolf. Once the werewolf tears up 4 out of 6 people Derek (Troy Mcgregor's brother) decides to identify the wolfman, which was quite obvious before the film even gets to that point. The rest of the film lack with some decent moments of laughter to then pick up again with the final battle scene.

We have to give Big Bad Wolf for taking an interesting spin on the werewolf B genre. For the first time we got to see a wolfman that speaks English and is a total pervert, which was extremely entertaining. One of our favorite parts was when the wolf chased down Derek in his car and charged through the passenger side window head first shattering the glass everywhere. There's nothing more comical then someone headbutting their way through glass. A huge plus for the film came from the wolfman himself who looked very familiar while in human form. After a little research we were blown away to realize he was the main bad guy that Arnold hunted down in Kindergarten Cop. Between that and 5 minutes of Clint you're sure to get a decent rating. So Big Bad Wolf wasn't the best B horror you could pick but is still worth the watch.",1280275200,2,2718,4.579055441478439

2789076,1,B000O179DG,"I try to warn people if they are truly going to waste their money on a film, but I see that this little mess is down to seven bucks or so, and it's well worth a two dollar rental out of silly fun.  I suspect that the high ratings here are the result of appreciation for the violent sexual content of the film, but be honest; it was a low-budget, meaningless, badly-acted pile best watched while drunk.  I gave this film one star based on the dvd cover - it's scary, perfectly composed, and beautifully uses lighting and color.  Remember, I'm talking about the cover there.

The talking werewolf sounded like an idiot and only a high-schooler would find those puns amusing.  David Naughton (who still looks pretty good) and Clint Howard showed up for their paychecks, albeit briefly.  What does that stepfather do in order to afford a two-million dollar home?  And why does he have enough time to wander around?  What is with that 70's haircut?

I suppose the most annoying thing is that the movie starts very briefly in ""Equatorial Cameroon"" and that caused a nagging feeling that wouldn't go away.  Would you let your lovely sister-in-law marry a murderous lunatic, knowing full well that the lunatic could rip apart her, your precious nephew, and dozens of other victims?  There you are, Charlie (yeah, you loser of a character), out being a tough guy hunting in Africa, and you just accept the killer and your brother's death with aplomb.  I suppose you couldn't do anything about it.  Oh, no, I suppose you couldn't find a use for that high-powered rifle just then.  You are only puttering about in the dark in a dangerous country where no one ever asks questions and you could have easily stopped it all with no problem.

Four of the six get picked off in about five minutes, one even being brutally raped by the werewolf, and don't think I've seen that before in a movie. And that was just the first unique perspective thrown into the very tired werewolf genre. Don't get me wrong, this is no Ginger Snaps, a werewolf movie that just oozes originality, but this movie does not follow the boring standard of many films that came before it. It switches gears so often I'm not really sure what's about to come next. Awesome graphic kills, a high body count, and some pretty solid acting as well.

Not because of the violence, which was as over the top as one might expect, but because of the implication that sexual violence against women is somehow humorous.  Unlike other horror movies with a high boob and body count, the writer of this movie (Lance W. Dreesen) never misses an opportunity to completely degrade and dehumanize the female characters.  A disturbing, repeated theme is how sexual violence perpetrated against women is mocked by a ""joke"" from the werewolf character.  For instance, one of the throwaway sorority girls in the opening sequence is revealed to be a virgin; this seemingly unnecessary plot thread is brought to fruition after she is raped by the werewolf before her throat is ripped out during the rape.  After this despicable act, the werewolf taunts her boyfriend about the rape, remarking, ""she ain't a virgin anymore!""  Another example: the lead female character, Sam, is revealed to be in love with the lead male character Derek.  This seemingly innocent plot thread is exploited when she is forced to perform oral sex on Derek's evil stepdad.  Of course, evil stepdad tells Derek all about it and remarks, ""you ain't tapped that yet?""

Don't let my description of these acts of sexual violence make you think that the acts are graphically depicted.  For the most part, the sex is implied rather than revealed, but the characters discuss sex in a graphic way.  I suppose it's all meant to reveal the main point of the movie, namely answering the question: ""what would happen if an evil s.o.b. was a werewolf?"" This movie certainly answers that question again and again, probably well beyond most viewers' willingness to watch it all.

I really hope that ""Big, Bad Wolf"" is the first and last movie made with this cast of characters.  I dread seeing what writer Lance W.

What anchors this movie, I think, are great performances by Richard Tyson and Kimberly J. Brown in particular, who show what good actors can do to elevate a story above its content -- although the story itself helps them in this primal conflict between man, boy, girl, and beast. Without wanting to spoil anything, Tyson wears his tortured villainy exquisitely, and Brown manages to be delightfully snarky, enterprising, and engaging throughout.

2789092,3,B000O179DG,"Two hunters are out in the woods near their cabin when one of them is killed by a werewolf and the other one survives.  Eight years later meek Derek Cowley (Trevor Duke) talks his pierced gal pal ""Sam"" Marche (Kimberly J. Brown), on a trip with some other college kids up to the cabin owned by Derek's family, even though it is strictly verbotten by his step-father Mitchell Toblat (Richard Tyson).  It turns out Derek is the son of the man killed by the werewolf.  At this point you should think that you know exactly where ""Big Bad Wolf"" is going.  But there are a couple of surprises with this 2006 horror film.  The first is that everything you think is going to happen is pretty much going to happen, but in the first act.  The second is that when the werewolf shows up again, not only does it start killing the characters whose names we cannot remember, it makes a bunch of really lame jokes, including the old bit about huffing and puffing.  This is one strange werewolf movie.

Once the second act begins, Sam gets to the crux of the matter, which is to figure out who the werewolf happens to be.  Actually, that does not take that long, but having seen a werewolf rip apart their acquaintances, Derek and Sam are insisting on being able to prove their suspicion. So this movie ends up going the ""Hamlet"" route, where Derek and Sam ""know"" who the werewolf is, but they fall into the trap of wanting proof so that they really ""know"" what they already ""know.""  Of course, this procrastination will end up killing people along the way, but that is what happens when the main part of the movie does not start until a half hour into the film.  But then we know full well that Act III is going to be played out back at the cabin in the woods, so nothing that happens while the sun is up really matters here.

Unnecessary comic relief is provided by a television news crew that keeps trying to ambush Derek and Sam to find out what really happened out in the woods.  Reporter Nick Baxter (Adam Hendershott) wants to know what the kids are hiding and why they survived when the others died.  The police report must indicate that they jumped in a car and drove away, with the ""animal"" smashing a window and destroying a door.  But for the sake of argument let us pretend this is a legitimate journalistic question: why does this jerk reporter think might be a better explanation?  Does he think they are hiding the fact that the killer animal was a werewolf?  Are they assuming the kids survived because they are virgins?  Yes, I know, the whole idea here is to make the kids nervous and it has nothing to do with legitimate journalism, but this is what happens when a movie fails to engage your brain.  Besides, the reporter needs to bring the desert menu for the werewolf's last meal.

To be fair, ""Big Bad Wolf"" does try to avoid being totally predictable.  A talking werewolf is rather different, although the makeup makes the creature look more like an ugly ape than a werewolf.  The werewolf in human form also has a few creepy moments as well during the second act.  As for the gore it is your basic clawing and dismemberment with a decided emphasis on excess.  The most shocking scene comes early on in a sick little in-joke regarding the only female virgin among the doomed students.  At the end I was starting to think of bumping up the rating on this one a bit, mainly because I like the character of Sam, but then she finds her weapon of choice and a silly little speech about deciding to live or to die gets punctuated by an unsurprising violent punch line and I gave up such thoughts (a judgment confirmed by the rather obvious ending that is not an ending).  The more you like over the top monster movies, the more you will like ""Big Bad Wolf,"" because this film ends up being all about the one-liners.",1190592000,24,3816,4.4312320916905446

2789095,4,B000O179DG,"Big Bad Wolf turned out a little different than I expected.  It started out rather familiar with a group of kids(a balanced ticket including two jerky frat guys, their bitchy girlfriends, a nerd and the tough biker chick who sees everyone for who they are and isn't afraid to tell them)  going to a secluded cabin for a bit of hanky panky, then getting slaughtered by a werewolf.  This all happens within the first 30 minutes, and I was left wondering, ""where's it gonna go from here?""  Well, after that typically cliched half hour, the movie becomes rather interesting.  Our two heroes(the nerd and biker chick) catch on to who the werewolf is and try to blow his cover.  This consists mainly of trying to obtain a DNA sample form him.  Naturally the werewolf doesn't like this too much and it becomes a game of cat and mouse as he tries to silence those trying to blow the whistle on him.  The werewolf happens to be the stepfather of our nerdy hero(this isn't a spoiler, you learn this very early on), making it more difficult for our hero to get away from him.  Add to that, he has to try to convince his mother to leave this guy as well.  This werewolf is a bit different in the fact that he A) can speak, which results in a few very bad puns and wisecracks, and B) can change at will, though he's at his most uncontrollable during the full moon.  Stress seems to be the primary cause of changing as well.  What really works about this film is actor Richard Tyson who plays the wolf.  You may remember him as the bad guy Cullen Crisp in Kindergarten Cop, or better yet, as bully Buddy Revell in Three O'Clock High.  Tyson's great and comes across almost just as threatening in human form as he does as the wolf.  This won't open the public's and critics' eyes to Tyson's acting abilities coz this is a low budget horror film, but the performance demands attention.  I'm talking it up big, but this is just a schlockfest.  However, it is a schlockfest with alot more going for it than most.",1181520000,26,1994,4.404371584699454
2789096,4,B000O179DG,"For this genre,this was one of the best. So many werewolf/monster movies have been made around the kids in the cabin, but this one was not. Had it been I would have loved for the makers to have explored the tension between Alex, the proverbial sex-crazed, in-crowd jock and Sam, the outsider, who does not care what anyone else thinks and has a defensive guard up so others cannot get close to her. That kind of mutual contempt usually leads to a good romantic storyline, even inthe middle of a horror movie. There are no other movies like this one, with the talking , very cognative  werewolf, who acts more than just on his animal instincts. All of the kids at the cabin were the usual; the witch of a beauty queen, the jock, the drunk, the nerd and the outcast. The storyline was not usual at all. The abusive stepfather/werewolf only made you want to see him get his that much more in the end. Derek was perfect as the nerd/hero. Throughout the movie you could see and feel his transformation from nerd to hero out of necessity.

The sex scenes make this movie not for children, but for your average horror fan, this is a must see and must buy. Derek's uncle Charlie kind of died without too much of a heros' demise; punch, scratch, intestine,open head. There was always the hope that he and Derek's mom would end up together at the end, but if he had to be killed by the werewolf, he should have died putting up more of a fight, perhaps beating Derek's stepdad , fist to fist, before he turned into a werewolf and did the above. His death did add to the wanting for retribution, but some reconnection between Charlie and Dereks' mother should have happened.  I always like the nerd to hero movies. Usually, I would say that there was too much killing in such a movie, but everything was done so well, with the killing being wrapped around the other stories; abusive  husband and steupfather, nerd gets the girl, etc, etc.

For years, ""The Howling"" was the greatest werewold movie I had ever seen. Then technolgy advanced, but the stories got worse. Along came ""Dog Soldiers"" which surpassed ""The Howling"". Big Bad Wolf equals and maybe supasses ""Dog Sodiers"". All in all, ""Big Bad Wolf"" is one big, bad movie.",1181520000,2,2214,4.525

Once again the fright-fan in me was a' mighty pleased with Lance Dreesen & Clint Hutchison's creation; the flick proves to be even more irreverent than their debut genre outing TERROR TRACT.  Blood flies.  Boobs bounce.  Plot twists prompt gleeful, ""Did I just see what I thought I saw?"" exclamations.  The laughs compliment the carnage.

H & D created yet another solid B horror film, a flick that works concurrently on several layers and keeps the audience happily engaged, and most importantly (for me) a film that eschews the current trend in 'torture-porn;' BIG BAD WOLF's aim is more to create a blood-soaked B roller-coaster full of hot naked girls than a grim, socio-political slaughter-fest, and it succeeds.

The girlfriend was great and the son was sort of one dimensional as a weakling being intimated by his dad.

  It will give you nightmares from the gore and the film does suffer a bit with the extra supporting characters without introduction. But they weren't important.
