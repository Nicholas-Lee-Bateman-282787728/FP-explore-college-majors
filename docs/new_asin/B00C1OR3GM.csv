5685981,5,B00C1OR3GM,My first DVD was over 2 yrs old. Replacement for my classroom. Students luv it and so do I . Good low impact and overall total physical response interaction!,1378598400,,157,4.448275862068965
5685982,5,B00C1OR3GM,"My daughter (now 4) has been listening to HeidiSongs since before she could talk. We have been a big fan of this DVD especially since it covers numbers and shapes. As a young toddler, my daughter loved to dance along to the DVD. Now older, I catch her singing HeidiSongs all the time. I'm very glad that these are now available for purchase on Amazon! I highly recommend any of the HeidiSongs products for your young learner.",1364601600,,425,4.532467532467533
5685983,5,B00C1OR3GM,"I have used this DVD (as well as others by Heidi) for several years with preschool children, typically developing, special needs, as well as students with English as a second language.  Most recently even children as young as one year old enjoyed the songs and movements. It's a great way to teach numbers and shapes which uses several senses and helps the children learn and remember!!! Great work, Heidi!!! Love your products!!  I recently retired, but would highly recommend this and any of Heidi's products for use in your classrooms.

8576307,5,B00C1OR3GM,"Again, yet another great DVD from Heidi Songs. This one is called ""Jumpin' Numbers & Shakin' Shapes. It is a great, detailed instructional video for kids and helping them memorize their numbers and shapes. My son was very happy with the music and repetition. It has helped a lot in terms of memorization. I am very impressed with the high quality in terms of the making of these DVD's.",1468281600,,385,4.594202898550725
8576308,2,B00C1OR3GM,"Video is 15 minutes tops.  It is an actual person and not a cartoon which I love, but you can go on youtube and find something very similar.  The issue is watching it everyday and talking to your toddler about  what they have seen.  Not worth the hype of it all.",1449964800,,262,4.078431372549019
8576309,5,B00C1OR3GM,"Heidi is the best! I used these in my Head-Start class and the results were awesome. Gave a set to my aide to use in tutoring, and a set to another teacher, then bought me a new set!",1449532800,,182,3.8157894736842106

8576312,4,B00C1OR3GM,"Bought this DVD for my summer school class. Teaching 15 students who will be heading into K in the fall. The program is structured to teach them ""key"" preschool standards and get them to mastery. They love these songs and ""dances"", as we call them. I love that when we need to get in a large motor activity in I have this great DVD that provides them number and shape reinforcement as well. It warms by heart to hear them singing the songs at our work stations....well after the Smart Board has been turned off.",1403308800,,511,4.389473684210526
8576313,5,B00C1OR3GM,My daughter loves to sing and dance along to the video. The songs are easy to remember and fun.  My nephew who is sensory seeking will also watch this and was able to learn his numbers.,1383782400,,185,4.138888888888889
