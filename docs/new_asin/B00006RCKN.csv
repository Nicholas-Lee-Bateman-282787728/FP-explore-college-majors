8136180,5,B00006RCKN,"Better than expected.  Left me wanting more of Murray's swing analysis!  Reminded me of my trip over to Scotland to play golf.  Excellent commentary, no Johnny Miller to be found commentating here for NBC.  All footage is taken from European telecasts.  Nice blend of other footage besides golf (security, etc) as well as actual coverage from the event.  Would highly recommend if you enjoyed the 99 Ryder Cup DVD.",1047600000,,414,4.927536231884058
