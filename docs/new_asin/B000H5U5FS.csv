8426643,1,B000H5U5FS,"If anyone is reading my recent reviews they may note that I am concentrating on the girlie DVDs.  I watch and love other types of movies especialy horror movies and enjoy them immensely.  However I don't tend to review the DVDs I enjoy because other persons have usually done so and I tend to agree with the reviews.  What disappoints me are that these types of DVDs have little or no reviews.  Again I don't usually post a review of the ones I enjoy.  It bugs me that the real lousy ones like this one don't have a review to warn you off from purchasing the damned thing.  So arthritis aside I thought I would post a review to WARN YOU ALL!!!!

The blurb says that this is a 2 hour documentary.  In fact it is only 88 minutes long and it seems all the decent nudity has been cut out.  You know what you get with Playboy, a load of egos gushing over each other saying how wonderful they and Hugh are and a load of mild soft focus nudity.

However, I didn't expect this to be as bad as it was.  I though I could cope with it because of the wonderful fast forward button BUT I found that I hardly paused and the end was quickly in sight!

The majority of the nudity is what has already been flogged to death on other Playboy vids, ie Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, Shannon Tweed etc.

The DVD is devided into segments, music, TV etc but it justs degenerates from the ridiculous to garbage {I won't credit it with sublimity}.

The reason I risked this is because I was hoping it would show Debbie Gibson, Tiffany etc.  It does feature Debbie(k/a Deborah to show maturity) but (and you note that there are a lot of buts here)it doesn't feature her in a live moving nude behind the scenes shoot just simply scans over her photo shoots so you hardly see her whole body in one frame (which is a big disapointment to someone like me who loves the austestic beauty of the female form especially one you know in real life or in the media.

Now bearing in mind that I was constantly fast forwarding this disc I may have missed a brief second of nudity but under the music segment there are no other famous singers only girls who have been in music videos!!!

I thought that the TV segment was ridiculous, (it spends precious time showing clips from the shows they featured in BUT no Playboy nudity unless, as I mentioned previously, we were given a namosecond show and I missed it) but the sport/olympian segment was farcical.  It only really featured Katrina Witt BUT when it showed the German Playboy edition? shoot all her bikini bits were censored with red paint!!!!!!  Could someone at Image or Playboy tell me what the hell that was all about!

There is a running feature throughout the DVd with Adrienne Curry? from Real House? a reality show.  Certainly she was a nice feisty filly broken in the end by a poor shoot BUT her feature was only for the cover so again no nudity and disappointingly so as she had a nice tidy body (hope people understand my English phrases)

So yet again another disappointed Playboy DVD with hardly any of the 50 years of celebrities on view.

The only good thing about Playboy is that because it is not explicit and tends to favour showing the whole female form (which is my bag) there are a hell of a lot females who are willing to pose for Playboy because they know the shots won't be gratuitous and wouldn't pose otherwise, so I'm grateful to Playboy for that BUT surely a Celebrity DVD should have feature more of them nude rather than just simply mention them?

Well despite seeing gynaecological pics of Britney this week, it is her whole body I want to see, so I hope Playboy are still interesed in doing a shoot with her!",1165017600,53,3658,4.377218934911243
