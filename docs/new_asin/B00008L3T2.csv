7985904,4,B00008L3T2,Video does what you would expect from it - shows the basics in an entertaining way. Mine came from inetvideocom and was supposed to be new but was used.,1198540800,,152,4.275862068965517
7985905,3,B00008L3T2,"I watched this movie last year I believe...and It is one of those movies you just don't remember very well.

Zero has had great productions since then..Was a big fan of ""new bloods""..But This really didn't stack up in anyway.

The quality was a bit shady and the energy could've been better.

However, an AWESOME instructional skateboarding video is this new one called Skateboarding Explained.

It is a KILLER step by step video and lacks nothing to be requested. Its totally helpful and leaves you with a want to create your own new tricks!

You can actually find it on Amazon :)

Keep Skating!

7985907,1,B00008L3T2,"Ok, first off, who needs a video to help them skate better. That is the stpidest thing i ever heard. Just go out to your local skatepark and ask people. They aren't going to be mean to you. Plus it will save you MONEY!!!!",1081987200,6,221,4.045454545454546
7985908,4,B00008L3T2,Video was good and there were a bunch of kids in the dvd that were learning to skate.  Not a lot of crazy tricks in the video but teaches basics....,1051574400,14,148,3.933333333333333
7985909,5,B00008L3T2,This video is great for kids and young adults.  My kid watches it everyday now and learn from this.  I recommend this video for everyone!,1051142400,3,137,4.44
7985910,4,B00008L3T2,"Mike Ogas really has something spedical here, in this instructional video.
My 10 yr old child just got his first skateboard, and this video was the prefect thing go along with it.
It had him up and going in no time at all, and i was especially impressed with the way this video combined entertainmaent and emphasis on safety in one package.  I definitely reccommend this
video and am looking forward to more of this series.",1051142400,4,423,4.565789473684211
7985911,5,B00008L3T2,"I have seen plenty of instructional videos like the Willy Santos, Tony Hawk, Thrasher, Starting point, etc...  but this is by far the easiest to learn to skate video i have seen.  I bought this last week and showed it to my little brother and now he's riding my board all the time.  It comes with a pocket book that he carries around and stickers that he puts on his school folders and stuff.  I've been riding for half my life and have been hurt plenty of times in the process, but this video was done right bye teaching basics and more.  I was impressed, and it's easy to follow and fun to watch.  I was happy to see some pro's in it like Kristian Svitak and Steffan Attardo but seriously, this is a good video.  If your looking for a solid skate instructional videos, this is the one.  Trust me, a lot of the trick tip videos out now will get you frustrated if you don't know what your doing and maybe even hurt.  It goes from picking out boards, to riding, to ramps.  Well, that's all i can really say about the DVD.  You really just have to see the video to understand what I'm saying....  Happy skating!!",1051142400,4,1110,4.233333333333333
