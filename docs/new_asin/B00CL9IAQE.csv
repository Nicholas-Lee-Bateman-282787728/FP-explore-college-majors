5725861,5,B00CL9IAQE,"I've read most of Mr. Miller's books, but this medium (video of a workshop) was especially good because the viewer is asked to think. The exercise of actively thinking like a criminal helps the viewer understand the different types of criminal from a very different perspective than normal. It has helped me look at the world in an important new way. Highly recommended.",1372204800,2,370,4.888888888888889
5725862,1,B00CL9IAQE,This DVD is very boring and drones on and on . Some info is ok but I have seen other people cover it better in a more enjoyable and flowing manor. I would advise you to read A Bouncers Guide to Barroom Brawling by Quinn.

5725864,5,B00CL9IAQE,"This video is broken down into convenient bite-size chunks or can be ingested all at once depending on preference. Rory is a good speaker and has clearly thought through and lived a lot of the subject matter.

First he presents a conceptual framework for the workings of a criminal mind using Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Then he offers simple and practical tools, which he demonstrates in various scenarios. There are a few follow up tips and suggestions. This vidoo is mostly focused for martial arts practitioners, but even the lay person will find useful information here.",1370390400,3,576,5.0

When your peaceful, helpful, wonderful, wouldn't hurt a fly neighbor , is being pulled under the ocean and drowning, he may not do the logical thing and relax into the arms of the lifeguard and be saved. He may, instead pull him down in panic and drown both.

When the psychotic mass murderer shows up in your town, do you, your neighbors, your local police know what to do? This DVD along with the companion books attempts to bring awareness to the dangers in very real life situations. 

This DVD offers a fascinating look into the underworld of violence and should be required material for every police force, martial arts school, military training center and anyone involved with dealing with the public safety.",1370131200,9,799,4.768115942028985
5725866,5,B00CL9IAQE,"I received this video directly from YMAA, specifically for review and it was NOT purchased through Amazon. Com

This new DVD lecture video created by YMAA Publication Center, addresses the concerns of horrific human violence as it is allegedly perpetrated through criminal means.

The lecture's model of presentation utilizes the Hierarchy of Needs as Abraham Maslow first postulated in 1943.  This pyramid model provides a fundamental operating system upon which Miller's lecture rests.

Divided into fifteen chapters, we are able to listen to Miller break down human violence and criminal choices into their psychological, physiological and overt behavioral expressions.

The types of violence humans perpetrate are divided into what Miller classifies as ""process predator,"" ""resource predator,"" a singular ""monkey dance,"" and group ""monkey dance,"" ""educational beat down"" and ""status-seeking show,"" all of which demonstrate the paradoxical side of the human brain/mind working hard to separate that which is connected as it seeks to approach opportunity, simultaneously avoiding and escaping risk.

Miller then goes on to describe the geography of violence where the young male territorial imperative seeks to maintain a strong and vital ""US"" versus ""THEM,"" whereas the ""US"" is supported and sustained through violent behavior as well as staunchly protected against and resisting the ""THEM,"" constantly at odds with violence.  These are areas we can proactively avoid.

From the geography of violence, Miller jumps into breaking down the human brain as it has biological evolved.  Here, Miller describes the nuances of this Triune Brain model, discussing the reptilian, paleomammalian and neomammalian brains, how these segments operate and influence human behavior, how they are connected, and at the same time, disconnected.

Miller then proceeds to provide an outlined methodology of how the resource predator plans and executes criminal violence along the parameters of getting what is needed to survive in day to day, hand-to-mouth existence.  We see how targets/victims are chosen and violated.

Following this outlined methodology of the resource predator, we find three distinct attack-scenarios and a visible ""monkey dance"" that are physically demonstrated as to how probable these assaults transpire.  After the physical altercations are shown, we are then offered solutions to how we can prevent these assaults from occurring.  These attack-scenarios are contextually based to offer a more realistic perceptual assessment of the attack and how to reverse these assaults.  This is not about techniques but about fully comprehending the attack-context and then countering the context.

A summary of all the previous materials covered ensues, concluding with a type of video appendix addressing ""Emotional Domination"" as women experience within the dynamic relationship of expressed human violence explained from a woman's perspective, i.e. Teja Van Wicken of DeviProtectiveOffense.com.  Miller ends the entire DVD lecture explaining ""Your Nightmare Opponent"" or the worst case scenario we can meet.

Over-all, the DVD lecture provides an in-depth explication of the who, what, when, where, why and how of criminal human violence from an individual who harbors the wisdom gleaned from having survived real world and real time criminal violence as a corrections officer/team-leader.

I recommend this DVD.

5725870,4,B00CL9IAQE,"I've read two of Rory Miller's books previously, and was intrigued to see how this DVD would help me build off of the information he's written.

The DVD tries to draw you into the mind of the bad guy and learn that most violence is predictable and logical. Although Logic of Violence is meant to be an instructor DVD for Martial Arts teachers, I think it's worthwhile for almost everyone who work with or find themselves in situations that deal with potential exposure to criminals.

Rory does a good job breaking down an abstract, unconscious process into concrete concepts that theoretically drive the actions of criminals. He explains the different levels of violence, from survival (e.g. drowning), to security (to feed an addiction), to belonging (social), or esteem or self actualized (predator).He uses an example of thinking like a resource predatorlisting and explaining the goal, parameter, victim profile, victim behaviors and locations that are logically figured out by a predator. He not only asks questions to the martial arts students in the class, but he also asks you to think and come up with ideas of your own, while you pause the DVD. There are also some physical demonstrations performed by the students, so that you get a visual of what does and doesnt work in some case scenarios.

As in his other works, it's important to provide the caveat that the violence that Rory describes is not so transferable to that caused by the mentally ill; Rory Miller's expertise tries to target logically minded criminals looking to exploit unsuspecting victims, rather than the unpredictable violence that can be caused by unstable individuals.

I thought this DVD was very valuable and offered good advice on what to do and what not to do in situations: be it a man doing the monkey dance in a bar, a woman walking that long hall to a public
bathroom, or a person getting into a car, entering an elevator, or at an ATM machine. Its about 3 hours
long- so it definitely requires a time and mental energy commitment. Like his other work, 'Logic of Violence' tries to make you think and be more aware of your surroundings, which I think it achieves quite solidly.",1397520000,3,2169,4.82258064516129
5725871,5,B00CL9IAQE,"Rory Miller does a fantastic job providing one with a resource for understanding how criminals think. It is obvious that Mr. Miller has had experience in dealing with criminals.

In so doing, the individual may find themselves in a better position to determine how best to deal with the situation in a manner which could save a life or the lives of others. I highly recommend this dvd for anyone who seeks to have a better grasp of how criminals think, along with how best to deal with them.",1395619200,,680,4.675
5725872,4,B00CL9IAQE,"First of all know that I am a BIG Rory Miller fan.  Why?  Because he is REALY good at what he does And what he does; is masterfully convey the very core aspects of violence to the viewer.  Here in 3 hours is, NOT ONLY, every thing you and your family need to know to avoid becoming the victims of violence; but it really is a great  day seminar on many aspects of our lives.  From the board room to the loading dock from the barroom to the breakfast table: what Rory shares has daily real world application.  And more importantly may save your life or the life of someone you love.

Violence works people!  You need to know that counter violence works as well.  And it does not, necessarily, need to involve a physical altercation on your part!

In this Video Rory:

 - Describes the mindset of violence.   Explains the victim list and how not to be on it.   Teaches you to raise your awareness, and lower your profile.  Because Awareness is the best defense!

Look, I work in logistics I unload planes and load trucks.  Then, I go out and make deliveries.  I deal with a great deal of testosterone and positioning.  I deal with disgruntled truckers, arrogant receiving clerks and drive into some really dicey neighborhoods.  At 52 years of age and weighing 170lbs, I could easily be on the victims list.  Let me assure you I am not.

I deal with positioning and dominance every day in the workplace.  Everything I practice every decision I make (in these elevated situations) is based on Rorys teaching.  Is it innate on my part or did I learn it from Rory or, did he help to define that which I kinda already knew?

Whatever it is  This Logic of Violence serves me well on a daily basis.

Not the fastest paced video in the world, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.

P.S.  I very much recommend Rorys book: Meditations on Violence  (FIVE STARS)",1394841600,3,1848,4.3916913946587535

5725876,5,B00CL9IAQE,"If you have an interest in practical self defense and crime prevention in today's world, make sure you check out the works of Rory Miller.

The DVD shows a seminar by Miller. Therefore most of the DVD shows people discussing things and making notes on a white board. The focus of the discussion is how and why do criminals do the things they do. This is discussed in the context of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and common sense and his and the other attendees experiences with criminals. (Miller is an experienced corrections officer, with a BS in Psychology, as well as a ju jitsu instructor.) Through this process the attendees and Miller create realistic crime scenarios and then work on how to avoid or defend against being a victim in these scenarios.

I recommend it highly for anyone interested in self defense and crime prevention.",1387670400,4,838,4.772413793103448

5725878,5,B00CL9IAQE,I started my journey with Rory when I read Meditations on Violence.  Since that time I read everything I could find from him.  He has a unique take on human violence and he writes about it in a thought provoking manner.  During this DVD is under scores lessons offered in his other publications.  I highly recommend it.  His work is equal to that of Mas Ayoob and Col. Cooper.,1383350400,2,376,4.391304347826087
5725879,5,B00CL9IAQE,"Rory has put together some great information, that I have not seen elsewhere. This presentation is long - 175 minutes, and you will want to get out a piece of paper or three and take some notes, especially if this is all new to you. I have been drinking in the Miller Well for a few years now, so I'm used to his presentation, and I always go back to re-read or listen AND for more. I've said it before, and I'll say it here - Rory is a DEEP THINKER. This is not an easy label, as you'll only get it when you GET IT. Oddly, on my second viewing I caught him saying 'you won't learn anything new' after going through this material. Well, he's correct on some levels, but don't let that stop you from proceeding. He's basically saying that you already know this stuff, you just don't KNOW that you know it. And he may be correct for a certain demographic, but I beg to differ. It's deeper than that even. You will only come to his conclusion once you GET IT, and I think that many won't get it until they do. I often try to compare notes with other professionals in my circles, and even at times they don't get it. They just drink at the wrong wells, buy into falsehoods, and for lack of a better analogy, put their heads in a hole and wait for the BAD to pass by. Rory has a solid handle on the information, based on his vast experience dealing with the BAD. He has a solid understanding too of how things work - things that we may instinctively know, but it's not floating on the surface for us. You have to stir the waters to bring it up, if you can open yourself up to this material. For me it's a necessity  - the more I know, or can know, the better equipped I'll be to deal with it. You can;'t buy this information any more affordably, and it will take more than a few viewings to take it all in and really understand it. It's not for everyone, although it should be. I highly recommend this outing from Rory. It will be invaluable to any THINKING MAN/WOMAN that truly wants to prepare themselves with ALL of the tools that would be necessary to be a contact professional - whether it be in Security, or Law Enforcement, or even in the Health Care field - EMT, Nurse, Dr. This information is invaluable to anyone that wants to really understand violence - all of it's nuances, it's flavors, it;s underlying tones. If you deal with it by dealing with it, you need this information - it'll answer a lot of questions, and help keep you safer. If you defer to others to deal with it, you can still benefit from the knowledge herein. It's a must for my library, and I recommend it for yours as well. Educate your mind. Learn as much as you can about violence, and learn as much as you can from Rory and his circle of friends - they all bring something to the table that you can't get elsewhere. They are furthering our ability to deal with violence, opening our minds to things that we don't want to think about, and puling back the veil on this thing we call violence. I put my trust in Rory, because he has and does, and I'm trying to. With his help, I'm getting there, safely, and informed beforehand! This gives me so many options, opportunities, and advantages that I didn't have five years ago. Thanks Rory.",1381708800,3,3213,4.25
5725880,5,B00CL9IAQE,"Having read a number of Rory's books I sat down with this DVD expecting to watch it fairly casually. Half way through the first section entitled ""Violence Types"" I paused the DVD, walked into my office, grabbed my notebook, and started taking notes as quickly as I could. What started as a casual watch turned into serious study for the full 2+ hours of content.

As the name suggests, this DVD focuses on analyzing the ways in which violence is conducted and to whom it happens to. Rory takes a fairly nebulous idea (I guess anyone could be attacked at anytime) and breaks down the actual probabilities of when/where/why violence occurs. As Rory states, a lot of this information is stuff we already know but need to understand and organize in a usable way.

The presentation of the DVD takes place primarily in a simple classroom environment with a few field trips to bars and parking lots. The environment isn't distracting, which is perfect because the focus needs to be on the whiteboard and how Rory is breaking down information. While watching I kept thinking about how much these explorations of violence made sense, but that I had never been able to put them together so coherently on my own.

The DVD has built-in prompts that allow you to ""play along"" with the four martial arts instructors attending Rory's session. It's tempting to ignore these prompts but if you have your notebook out (which you really should) it's valuable to give them a shot. The reason why is simple - if you practice with Rory, your students can then practice with you. That's the ultimate aim of this DVD. It is a guide to help you teach your students better. It shows you what you might be missing in helping them understand their own victim profile and the difference between predator types. it also provides actionable thought drills that you can take directly into your next self defense session.

I recommend this work even for owners of similar books and videos.",1380931200,2,1956,4.7272727272727275

5725884,5,B00CL9IAQE,Rory Miller has once again shared his depth of knowledge with us.  This video has been amazingly useful for myself and the my martial arts students for gaining an understanding of the very people we are training to defend ourselves against.  This video is a must have for anyone who may find themselves in a situation where they have to deal with the criminal element.,1373846400,,368,4.6461538461538465
5725885,5,B00CL9IAQE,"I've read most of Rory's books and seen most of his videos.  Generally speaking, his work is not entry level, meaning you should have at least a basic foundation of training and study before attempting to absorb a large amount of valuable data you'll not be able to fully understand or appreciate without prior knowledge or experience.  This seems to be reflected in a few of the bad reviews.

While most of Rory's work seems directed towards students, this video, ""Logic of Violence,"" seems intended primarily towards instructors.  It is very long (nearly 3 hours) and more academic than his other videos, with the bulk of the video taking place before a dry erase board.  The video presents very much like a 201 level university class on how and why criminals select targets, and common tactics and methods used by them.  I recommend you think of this video as a college course too.  Get out a notepad and pen, and plan on breaking it up into three hour long viewing sessions.

There is a LOT of very important and relevant information being conveyed here . . . information which is NOT being taught by the majority of instructors.  As Rory says, most martial artists are taught how to fight other trained fighters, either in competition or with a military application.  The way students are being taught does not carry over into a street mugging or group beatdown very well.  Furthermore, absolutely nothing is being taught about the tactics of ""psychological dominance"" that ""process predators"" (typically serial rapists and killers) use to immediately disorient, pressure, and persuade a victim into willingly accompanying him to an isolated location.  Nobody else is teaching this stuff, and while a black belt in karate or a concealed handgun permit might give you a bit of an edge, if you are oblivious to the most common danger signs and have never established clear boundaries which must never be crossed, you can be tricked and victimized as well.

The average predator has far more experience with violence than the average martial artist.  That is a fact that most people experienced with violence acknowledge, but the average martial arts instructor has never been in an actual fight off the mat, nor have they generally been targeted for a mugging or beatdown.  The average student also tends to have very limited real world experience with violence.  When it happens, it's unexpected and explosive and you may be too shocked to react effectively.  Knowing certain danger signs to be aware of is important.  Being aware that someone is behaving abnormally or transgressing social taboos will give you a bit of advance warning, and when they progress to actually closing the distance and making light physical contact you're beyond the first stage of the ""interview"" process and they are maneuvering themselves into position for a sudden attack, or are about to manipulate you into accompanying them to an isolated location.  If you're unaware of these ruses, it is easy to be duped.  The average black belt has never even heard about most of this stuff.

If you are learning self defense, you need to know that the most effective method to protect yourself is simply being aware of dangerous situations and avoiding them.  Some situations you just can't avoid, and some attackers very deliberately try to present as non threatening in order to get you to lower your guard.  Then there are the instances where you are dealing with someone who just wants to beat someone up and the wrong word or movement can set them off.  Knowing a few tips on how to interact with unstable people or armed robbers is also helpful.  Rory covers all this and more.

I highly recommend Logic of Violence for ALL martial arts instructors as well as serious students.  A ton of useful information here for anyone with the patience to absorb it.  Not a lot of action or jokes to keep you entertained, this is simply a massive download of data about how criminals think, who they target, and why.  Groundbreaking stuff you will not see addressed in such detail elsewhere.  5 well earned stars.",1373760000,19,4085,4.861271676300578

8582980,5,B00CL9IAQE,"Amazing DVD on the nature of predatory violence. Useful for trained fighters/martial artists and for those of us not so skilled at self defense ;-)  A definite learning experience, especially in light of how Hollywood depicts violence and of the often unrealistic expectations for our police/soldiers when they are faced with violence.  One of the many valuable points made in this DVD is how FAST violence happens and how little, if any, time you really have to respond.  To expect a ""thoughtful reasoned response"" in the few seconds of an attack is pretty much impossible when you see what actual violence looks like.  It is a LOT of (hopefully helpful) reaction and blind dumb luck to survive.
A second lesson, for those of us who are not mandatory responders to dangerous situations, is to not go into a dangerous situation or to leave before the problems start.  While that is not something that police officers, security officers or soldiers can (or should) do, it is an important take away for the rest of us.  Not needing to be rescued is a much better choice.  In other words, don't do dumb dangerous things that will endanger you.  If you must go into a dangerous place, take good precautions.
And trying to play hero when you have no actual hero skills often makes you a victim, too.  It is often more heroic to call for the actual heroes and then stay out of the way so as not to make it worse.
