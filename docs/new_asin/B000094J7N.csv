7989314,5,B000094J7N,"I'm 47 year old man who does this video with his fiance at her request to help keep me in shape and to provide another way to spend some quality time together.  I am a rookie at yoga, and didn't want anything too intense (while she is very experienced and can contort into all sorts of impressive poses). I tried at least a dozen different yoga videos. Some were too long (I usually don't have time for a 1 hour+ video), some were too hard (I'll never be able to put my leg behind my head), and some were too theoretical/spiritual (I really don't care who someone's yogi is or how they changed his /her life) ... but this one was just right. It is one of two yoga videos I'll actually do... the other is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Core-Cross-Train/dp/B000YV1L44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga - Core Cross Train</a>, which I also review on its page.

We've actually done all three work outs, and all three work well for beginners but still seem to be worthwhile for her (you do need a yoga ball for one of the, but it is worth it for the other two if you don't happen to have one). Each workout is about 30 minutes long and includes about a dozen different yoga poses/moves. It is very practical, and can be challenging at times but not too difficult (I think anyone even in fair shape should be able to do or work up to most of the poses... it even includes modifications for the harder poses to make them a bit easier). I will admit it is a bit awkward the first few times as it's difficult to do some of the poses and look at the screen (but that passes by the 3rd or 4th time you do it).  I'd say it is a great video for beginners or moderate beginners, but think even experienced yoga folks would still enjoy it (especially if you want to work out with a beginner or encourage someone to give yoga a try).",1400198400,,1864,4.492625368731564
7989315,5,B000094J7N,I love this yoga video. As long as you can stand on one foot for 1 min with out falling over you can do the moves on this video.,1366070400,,128,3.4482758620689653
7989316,5,B000094J7N,"My order came very promptly. I haven't had time to use the DVD yet, I've actually gotten to the gym all this time, but she does terrific workouts.",1250035200,,146,4.25
7989317,4,B000094J7N,"All of the workouts are challenging, but enjoyable.  I especially like the yoga workout.  The scenery is beautiful, the instruction good (albeit fast for a beginner), and the workout, refreshing.  The balance ball workout too has all the same ingredients.  A nice balance to rotate into your workout schedule.",1144627200,,309,5.244897959183674
7989318,4,B000094J7N,"This DVD provides a nice variety of workouts for the lower body:  a yoga practice, a Pilates practice, and a stability ball workout.  The DVD is well-chaptered, with individual menus for each of the three workouts.

The first workout, Yoga for Lower Body, has three sections, an introduction, a 25-minute yoga practice, and an explanation of modifications; start with the latter if you are relatively new to yoga.  Because instructor Suzanne Deason moves along at a somewhat brisk pace, I wouldn't recommend this practice for those with no prior yoga experience, as they are likely to have difficulties following along.  The practice includes some nice standing balance poses such as dancer and half-moon, although Deason doesn't hold the postures for very long.  However, I enjoy Deason's calm, supportive manner and find her to be warm and engaging.  Although I would prefer if she had held the poses a little longer, I love that I can do this varied practice when I'm short on time.  This was my favorite workout on the DVD.

The Pilates Lower Body workout is led by Jillian Hessel, and it consists of an introduction, a short (1 minute) posture segment, Pilates matwork, and a balance challenge to finish.  The workout begins with some nice foot a leg stretches while lying on your back. You then perform some of the tradition Pilates mat exercises, doing only those that focus mainly on the legs such as leg circles and bicycle. There also are some more unique moves such as opening and closing the legs in a stradle position. Next comes the Pilates side kick series, including exercises that focus on both the outer and the inner thighs; there are also a few movements performed lying face down to work the back of the legs. The workout ends with a short standing balance segment, coming in at just under 29 minutes. This workout wasn't very challenging, but if you enjoyed the thighs segment from Crunch Pick Your Spot Pilates, you will probably enjoy this as well.  However, this was my least favorite workout on the DVD.

The final workout on this DVD is Balance Ball Lower Body.  In this workout, instructor Suzanne Deason leads you through a nice, moderately challenging routine to work your lower body on the ball. She begins with a 5-minute instructional and warm-up section and then moves on to the 27-minute workout. The workout starts sitting on the ball for balance challenge work such as knee lifts and leg extensions, which Deason makes progressively more difficult. She also does some dips with the ball behind your back to work your butt, but I didn't feel much wiht this move. Next comes some work lying face down over the ball, including leg lifts and extensions. At first, this felt easy to me, but Deason then goes on to more challenging moves from an elbow plank position, and I could really feel my butt working. Lying sideways over the ball for Pilates-like moves comes next; for some reason, this position did not feel comfortable to me. Deason finishes with some inner thigh work by holding the ball between your thighs in a seated position. The final 5 minutes of the workout consist of stretching, including forward bends over the ball, bridge pose with your feet on the ball, and hamstring/leg stretches. Plus, Deason includes many stretches throughout the routine, making this a nice workout if you want to gently challenge your muscles while providing plenty of opportunity to make them more flexible as well.

Overall, I think this DVD provides great variety at a bargain price.  The workouts are not overly challenging and are mostly appropriate for advanced beginners to intermediates.  One final note is that the DVD includes a program reference guide which provides a complete list of exercises for each of the three workouts.  Definitely a recommended purchase.",1122940800,21,3802,4.888024883359254
7989319,2,B000094J7N,"the instruction in this tape is lackluster.  I've been doing yoga for a few years, and am familiar with all the yoga lingo, but found this DVD hard to follow (you do a lot of work on your back, and can't see the TV, so you rely on their spoken directions, which aren't that great.  All, in all--my lower body feels slightly worked out, but mostly my neck aches from straining to see the TV.",1066521600,15,390,4.1866666666666665
