5819395,1,B00DJ5IQ8Q,I just watched DVD 1 and half of it is old footage to show the background of characters. This anime itself is always using old footage to waste time and make more money but this time they took it too far with this DVD release. I am going to have to find an alternative from now on to watch this show. It's frustrating enough that this anime is already like years old in Japan and we get this horrible treatment just because we are American consumers.,1378252800,2,450,4.244186046511628
5819396,2,B00DJ5IQ8Q,"Honestly this set is terrible. Its 2 episodes of Robin's past and then a solid 2 hrs of reshowing of season 1 and 2 footage. Seriously Funimation knock this s *** off, didn't you learn by the success of kai?",1378252800,2,207,4.2
5819397,5,B00DJ5IQ8Q,"""One Piece: Season Five, Voyage Two"" is the box set I have been looking foreword to the most. Last box set, the episodes surrounding Robin's past is revealed and more is expected in this upcoming release. The only thing I can warn for One Piece fans who have not seen the episodes is to be prepared for some of the most heart wrenching plot points in the show thus far. One of the most powerful moments in the anime (or manga for that matter) is coming up in the very first episode of the box set. So far, I have been incredibly impressed with the English voice cast. We shall see how the English cast continues to do. The words ""Say you want to live!"" are considered by many One Piece fans as one of Luffy's most intense moments in terms of truly standing up for his crew. Good luck Colleen Clinkenbeard! You have quite an act to follow!",1377216000,2,838,4.276729559748428
5819398,5,B00DJ5IQ8Q,i loved watching one piece season 5 voyage one i just can't wait for this one to come out so i can watch it omg i was like just grabbing on to my couch while watching this i mean its like about how true friends are and how you fight to protect them and its also like how to treat your friends as well overall i am just saying its amazing the dub is amazing always frankys voice is amazing can't wait to here brooks voice in the movie strong world i just want to know who's gonna voice him its killing me to wait,1376265600,2,511,3.876190476190476
5819399,2,B00DJ5IQ8Q,"That was a cheap trick. The description of the set never told me that I was buying a bundle of flashbacks. Here I was excited to finally own the arc with saving Robin, only to watch in horror as the episodes going by were basically rerun episodes. The funimation translations were pretty bad as well.
I'm a huge fan of One piece but something like this is not worth the overpriced money.",1387929600,,387,4.388888888888889
5819400,3,B00DJ5IQ8Q,Shipping arrived on time and everything perfect. But season 5 all togeather is horrible. Full of fillers witch is really annoying because soooooo close to climax. Seems like they got greedy with the plot and tried to extend it as long as possible to make money. This season was a waste of my money pluse one whole CD had nothing but flashbacks in it from season on. Was really lame because i own season one and i could of rewatched season 1 and seen the same exact thing.,1385596800,2,471,4.363636363636363
5819401,2,B00DJ5IQ8Q,Most of this volume is  just flashbacks on previous seasons. There are only four actual new episodes. Not worth  the full price.,1384041600,2,128,4.7727272727272725
5819402,5,B00DJ5IQ8Q,Another great addition to the One Piece series. You can't miss out on any part of this epic stage of their journey.,1383264000,,115,4.2727272727272725
5819403,2,B00DJ5IQ8Q,"Really sad the Japanese writers felt the need to rehash all of the crews backstories for most of these episodes. So only some of these episodes are new content. the parts that are new are good, but you will feel gyped spending full price on this, especially when i already own the previous episodes that are simply replayed again on these. Funimation has kepted to the ""uncut and unedited"" motto very well, but this is one time i wish they strayed from that.",1381276800,3,458,4.530120481927711
5819404,1,B00DJ5IQ8Q,About 1 hour of new footage rest was re showings of characters back story can't believe they ripped me off like that I have preordered everyone now I'll be waiting to hear reviews,1380844800,2,179,4.454545454545454
5819405,5,B00DJ5IQ8Q,my son loved his new movie.it came on time at  good price .he will watch it many times .hes very happy.thanks,1380758400,3,109,4.190476190476191
5819406,1,B00DJ5IQ8Q,"Love the series, but this one was a let down. It's almost all recap of the characters back stories. If u buy them for collection reason then buy it. Otherwise skip it. Not worth the money. Only about 4 episodes worth of new content.",1380672000,6,232,4.295454545454546
5819407,2,B00DJ5IQ8Q,"This is by far the worst release by funimation of one piece so far.  This collection contains about 4 episodes total of new footage.  The rest is ALL RECAP!  IM NOT JOKING!  The episodes were the story actually advances are pretty good.  But its too little, too late.  After such a build of the Enies Lobby Arc, to stop all the momentum and excitement for over 4 episodes of nothing but recap is not only unfair, but stupid.

My advice, don't even watch the middle 8 episodes, or skim through them fast forwarded if need be.  If you try to watch them all, you will lose all the excitement that was built up from the last voyage release.",1378857600,3,636,4.330508474576271
5819408,5,B00DJ5IQ8Q,If you don't take risks you can't create a future. So watch it. This review brought to you by the future King of the Pirates! Now lets eat some meat!,1378684800,,149,4.0

8593743,4,B00DJ5IQ8Q,"Don't listen to the rest of these morons claiming this volume is a rip off - this is Robin's past in almost it's entirety and is SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT to the main storyline of One Piece. If you skip this volume, you will surely regret it. Yes, there were some series review episodes, and I'm surprised Funimation didn't compensate for this, but only less than half of the episodes are of this filler nature - the rest are all great quality. And while it may seem like a cheap trick considering Funimation knows about these going in, I can't help but feel grateful they took the time to make sure they got EVERY EPISODE instead of skipping one or two. We are getting One Piece as it was originally broadcast - what more could you possibly ask for?",1407628800,4,748,4.467153284671533
