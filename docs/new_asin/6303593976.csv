7901860,5,6303593976,"This is a great movie. It's interesting to see what a  great actor Antonio Banderas always was, even as a young man. He's probably the bravest actor on the planet. Law of Desire proves that.
He's so conflicted here and his sister manipulates him right down the drain. He's driven to save himself but he can't, she's too powerful. He finally pulls away but he's left alone, with nothing. She came to him eyes  closed and she left that way.
The landscape is beautiful. The idea of her power  driving him to the edge, committing acts contrary to his nature, it's all very intense.
He's drop dead gorgeous and probably 22. All that talent too. I heartily recommend this movie. I watch it over and over and see something new each time.",980294400,6,730,4.515151515151516
