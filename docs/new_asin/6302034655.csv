419825,5,6302034655,"The Last Polka owes much of owes a ""documentary"" style not only to ""The Last Waltz"" but also ""The Compleat Beatles"".  However, the humor is pure SCTV and it will delight anyone unwillingly exposed to polka music and/or the Lawrence Welk show.  Like everyone, I wish HBO would re-release this small gem, preferably in a DVD format.  I need to hear the Lemon Twins!",1079395200,13,363,4.640625

7820461,5,6302034655,"My friends were talking about this movie and bemoan the fact that there is no DVD.  This is one of our top ten comedies of all time..right there with Blazing Saddles, The Blues Brothers, Shawn of The Dead, to name a few.",1376870400,3,220,4.238095238095238

7820463,5,6302034655,I put this VHS in my hubby's Cmass stocking.  He was thrilled and I cant beleive I got my hands on one in this good of shape. The old one is worn out.,1293408000,,150,3.5454545454545454
7820464,5,6302034655,I happen to BE a polka fan and their portrayal of the polka kings is not very far off - corny humor is right on target. They have their satire so perfect that they even included facial moles!! I bought a copy of this on Amazon some years ago and am very afraid to play it more than every once in a while for an unsuspecting houseguest because I don't want to ruin it. I want this on DVD. I thought I would need oxygen from laughing so hard at the tuba solo. Now this is what I call genius!,1265673600,3,489,3.9
7820465,5,6302034655,Those of us who grew up in search of our identity coming out of one the many and colourful ethnic enclaves from Eastern Europe of which our parents were a part will find themselves very much at home in this earlier version of the undertones to be found in My Fat Greek Wedding that exposes the great divide between those of us of non-Anglo Saxon origins adapting and yet maintaining something of our roots and values that are often expressed in music.  That's the note that John Candy and company hit resoundingly in this masterpiece of comedy and yet exposes a world many North Americans have never known even existed in their midst.,1232236800,,634,4.610619469026549
7820466,5,6302034655,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Not 5, but 10 stars for this one!  Just as hysterically funny today as it was in the 80's.  It's a mockumentary about 2 ""famous"" polka musicians, and their band and associates. Rick Moranis is incredibly funny in this (as The Shmenges lead singer), as are the rest of the cast.  I wish that someone would release a collection of all of The Shmenge Brothers SCTV Skits - I'd pay top dollar for that!  Also there needs to be a DVD/re-release/distribution of ""The Last Polka"".  CABBAGE ROLLS AND COFFEE, ANYONE? MMM MMM Good!",1161216000,8,542,4.663157894736842
7820467,5,6302034655,"This needs to be on DVD because ""how are the little children going to learn about the polka music!!!!!!!""?",1138665600,8,106,4.631578947368421
