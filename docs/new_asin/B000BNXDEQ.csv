2430661,5,B000BNXDEQ,"Wonderful concert. The lighting, angles, quality, all brilliantly captured.

All the songs on this DVD are from Pablo Honey/The Bends, as well as a few b-sides which make it an even more interesting show. The energy from all the band members is fantastic, they are alive and well for this performance.

This is definately a must have for any fan of Radiohead.",1132963200,5,359,4.774193548387097
2430662,5,B000BNXDEQ,"First off let's start by saying that this is some great music by one of the most influential bands ever. Jonny Greenwood on guitars is showing off his skills which would only get better as by 'The Bends' and 'Ok Computer' era. Thom Yorke's singing is a bit undeveloped at this point in time but we all know what it is today. The rest of the band, Ed O'Brien, Phil Selway, and Colin Greenwood are great at their respective instruments but their youth is evident but as we all know they only got better which is why it is a dissapointment that Capitol decided to release this live concert instead a concert from the '97-'03 era. Overall, the quality of this DVD is astounding and the sound is amazing but the one knock is the fact that the camera is very twitchy and switches angles too fast, which has been stated clearly in the previous reviews. It poses only a minor problem however. Highlights of the songs include 'Street Spirit', 'Maquiladora', 'Black Star', 'Just', 'My Iron Lung', 'Prove Yourself' and of course 'Creep'. Let's just hope that Capitol will release Glastonbury '97 or '03 or the concerts in Lisbon and Barcelona. Overall, I give this a 5 but if I could i would give a 4.5 because of the camera and the inexperience of the band but be assured this is a great DVD definently worth owning if you have any interest in Radiohead.",1132963200,9,1344,4.512295081967213
2430663,5,B000BNXDEQ,"This is surreal to watch.  Not only is it a fantastic show, it is just before The Bends is released and it is just wild to see and hear these songs played prior to release when the crowd in attendance had never heard them.  I watched knowing that when the album was released Radiohead was going to come of age and anyone in that crowd was going to be blown away.  The crowd reactions are great and Thom is introducing songs from The Bends as NEW.  The energy is just incredible.  The guitar playing is phenomenal. The talent is unbelievable.

Also, seeing this live gave new life to some of the songs off of Pablo Honey that had never caught me before, expecially Prove Yourself.

I agree that they should have let the camera linger a little longer, especially on Johnny.  But still, this deserves 5 stars.

I am also hoping that they are releasing this on DVD now so that we fans get it now and have plenty of cash saved for all of the great material (in various formats) that they are going to release in 2006!!!

2430664,3,B000BNXDEQ,"the audio quality on the vhs is great, and one would expect the dvd audio to be as good or better. radiohead put on an excellent show with more energy than the famous venue can contain.

Also, an interesting fact is that the version of 'my iron lung' that appears on 'the bends' album is the live version performed here. the only difference is that thom did a different vocal take for the album. so why am I giving 3 stars? because there's a big downside: the camera work actually makes it difficult to watch. they don't do anything fancy with effects, thankfully, however they also don't keep the camera fixed on a shot for more than a couple seconds. I've watched lots of live gigs where multiple cameras were used, and this is the first where the angle switching is so frequent as to draw away from the performance and make it a chore to watch. be warned! I'd pick this up anyway though, since it's the only official live radiohead video of an entire gig.",1132012800,6,958,4.4124293785310735
2430665,5,B000BNXDEQ,"I have had a VHS copy of this show for years, and it's about the most kick-ass guitar-driven rock concert you could ever ask for... This covers most of Pablo Honey and some ""new songs,"" as they play many songs from The Bends a year before it was released... Pretty standard set list from back then: You, Bones, Ripcord, Black Star, Creep, The Bends, My Iron Lung, Prove Yourself, Maquiladora, Vegetable, Fake Plastic Trees, Just, Stop Whispering, Anyone Can Play Guitar, Street Spirit, Pop Is Dead, Blow Out... High points are the spectacular opening ""You,"" a rare live performance of ""Black Star"", and the sheer artillery of their amazing B-side ""Maquiladora."" The only downside to this DVD: After hearing this, you'll kick yourself for not having heard of Radiohead until 1999.",1131926400,16,779,4.9541984732824424
2430666,5,B000BNXDEQ,"1994 featuring material from Pablo Honey and The Bends.  Very strong performance some of the camera effects are a bit distracting, as is common, but the quality is good to excellent.  Must see for anyone who didn't see them early in their career.  Check out Thom's hair, It's worth it for that alone.",1366934400,,300,4.622641509433962
2430667,5,B000BNXDEQ,"I read reviews on this that said ""You only get to see certain parts of the band"". Well,get some tall guys standing in front you and you wouldn't see anything. I ordered it and loved it just fine. I can't come up with a name for him because he's so different than anyone in music I have seen. I love Radiohead and buying their music. Enjoy the performance because it is diffidently a whole new world in his head! Greenwood does a great job doing the computer and tearing up on his guitar. Get this DVD,sit back and take the head trip with them.",1363478400,,543,4.230769230769231
2430668,5,B000BNXDEQ,"This concert is from 1994, so your seeing a very early Radiohead live show, pretty much just 'The Bends' and 'Pablo Honey'. Your not gonna see any of the electronic infused tunes of the oh so great 'Kid A', your getting straight hard rock from Radiohead here instead. Personally I just adore 'Kid A' and really love 'Amnesiac' and 'Hail to the Thief', but this is a great early peek at 'Radiohead' and am very happy with my purchase. Also, note that the audio quality is very, very good, which is rare for a concert so early in a band's career on DVD.",1363046400,,551,4.359223300970874
2430669,4,B000BNXDEQ,"Radiohead is a victim of their own creativity. They continue thinking that they must ""push the envelope"" into Electronica, when they are, at heart, a guitar-based, melodic, rock and roll band. THIS is, alas, the only ""professional"" video we have of live play of their first two albums when they were ""just a simple guitar band"", and it's saddening to the point of depression. After all, anyone can take electronic loops and make crap like they and a million other ""bands"" and individuals are doing now, but only geniuses can take 4-6 guys and make their instruments really work together and sing together like Radiohead was doing in the 90's. I'm not a nostalgic guy, but I have to say this period up through ""OK, Computer"" were their best live era...everything since has gone downhill, regardless of what the ""critics"" say and what Thom Yorke thinks...

They may have felt trapped, but tell me a song like ""High and Dry"", or ""Bones"", or ""Anyone can Play Guitar"", or ""Black Star"", or ""Fake Plastic Trees"" aren't better than anything else they've done since ""Computer"". You'd be lying to yourself if you said there was anything better than those. An ""art fart"", if you will...

So, don't miss this concert/DVD. There is no better stamp of this band's energy and greatness. Their melodic lines were never better and they never performed better than this.

I took off a star for the (lack of) production. The film is pretty grainy and the shots are mundane, BUT, the music is still great, and the performances are mercurial....",1358121600,,1524,4.787072243346008
2430670,4,B000BNXDEQ,"1 star minus for not being top quality. Especially when watching this on a bigger screen... doesn't look so great at 90"". The music is awesome though, and the sound is pretty good, and the 1994 Radiohead is the best part about this. LOVE ME some pre '98ish Radiohead.",1327536000,,267,4.469387755102041
2430671,4,B000BNXDEQ,"I agree that some of the editing on this could give people motion sickness (myself included) but I think that's more toward the end. Just keep in mind that this was recorded during the era of hard and fast MTV-style editing. Having said that, I just saw this dvd for the 2nd time and enjoy it the more I see it. It really showcases just what an amazing band Radiohead were destined to become. The raw energy and passion of the band comes out here to make you feel like you're there. Since I'm a fairly new RH fan (2008), a lot of this music was new to me and I've come to really love most of it since seeing this. The visual and sound quality is professional and you won't be distracted by waving cell phones in the audience. A great reason to buy it alone.",1303516800,,757,4.156462585034014
2430672,5,B000BNXDEQ,"Man, whoever said, this video is too quick for your eyes, here is Radiohead at their early best and exciting and and a MUST for all rock fans. This is Pink Floyd reincarnated with Led Zep in tow. And then go to ""From the Basement"" , what transfiguration. I love them",1217116800,2,266,4.235294117647059
2430673,4,B000BNXDEQ,"The performance and music are superb, this is Radiohead at their best in my opinion. In fact, I think this live performance is better than anything they have recorded in the studio. Too bad the frantic jumping from one camera shot to another every 2 seconds gives me vertigo. To you film makers; get a clue, it's about the music not YOU!",1213660800,4,337,4.451612903225806
2430674,5,B000BNXDEQ,"Yeah, there's lots of quick cuts in the editing, but what a FANTASTIC CONCERT!!!!
If your even mildly interested in Radiohead, pick up this DVD.
You won't be sorry...",1211500800,,166,4.758620689655173
2430675,4,B000BNXDEQ,"Despite the quick-cut editing, which is more and more commmon these days and really isn't too bad here, this live-concert DVD is a superb look at the experience that was a Radiohead show just prior to their rise to superstardom. The audio is quite good and the setlist, comprised mostly of songs from ""Pablo Honey"" and ""The Bends,"" is rockin'. I never thought too much of ""Pablo Honey"" until I saw this DVD, which caused me to revisit ""Pablo Honey."" VERY glad I did!",1179100800,,466,4.559523809523809
2430676,5,B000BNXDEQ,"I have to admit, I didn't get into Radiohead until OK Computer. I then picked up The Bends and realized what a bunch of talented guys they were. The live concert is Radiohead at their beginning before the rise to super stardom. The energy they deliver in each song represents a band that is really working hard to prove themselves. I doubt you would see that kind of intensity from them these days. I would like to point out an aspect of this concert that most people would ignore and that is the lighting. I'm not joking. When lighting is done right, it adds to the experience of a show. The quick cuts didn't bother me that much, in fact I think it added to the excitement of the performance but the lighting was actually done by people that knew the music and knew how to emphasize each mood change perfectly. The music is performed with almost flawless precision. Fake Plastic Trees and Blow Out were standouts for me. I would recommend this DVD not only to fans of Radiohead but to anyone who enjoys modern alternative music. This is how it should be done!",1167350400,3,1061,4.446153846153846
2430677,5,B000BNXDEQ,"Anybody that watched this and gets frustrated at the occasional editing has a legitimite reason to complain about a few moments in this otherwise brilliant DVD.

Sometimes you miss the best parts of certain songs because an edit or two is made quicker than you'd like.....Sometimes you'd like to see a wide shot with the crowd w/ the blue haze and the whole band for 10-15 seconds to let the thing breathe.... I get that.

But beyond all of that, this thing is so cool if you like either Radiohead or the music of the the early Grunge-Alternative scene.  Seeing the crowd get in a frenzy during 'Ripcord' and NEW songs like 'The Bends' and 'My Iron Lung' is almost like a history lesson on Radiohead - what they used to be like.  Any fan knows they altered their reputation as a rock band to seek a deeper, darker and untapped genre of music.

What we see in the DVD is the rawest form Radiohead, who was about to release perhaps the best album of the 90's (The Bends) and these fans had no idea until they got to see it in person.  Pablo Honey was the perfect alternative record for the times - Several deep cuts with a hit - the quentissential hit (Creep), and a very memorable ending (Blowout)......So the anticipation for the new album-to-be was high.

So when rolled into one, it is amazing to see these 4 guys do it then, so straight forward and direct rock and roll, when now they put on more of a production and a show to please a very thirstly audience.  Radiohead proves that even in it's infant stages as rock stars, they could rock as hard as ANY legitimate world-wide band.  Watch 'Blow Out' one more time - they make their point.  And then there's 'Creep'.... it's the very rare example you will ever get to see this song live - and it's as intense as the first few times you heard it in 1993.

Point Blank - it proves why many Radiohead fans loved the band from the beginning.

Enjoy.",1147737600,5,1899,4.363636363636363
2430678,5,B000BNXDEQ,"Performed in 1994, several months before the release of The Bends, this concert is a time capsule of a time when the band was just beginning to realize their full potential. Smoke'em if you got'em and be prepared to be amazed. From the very first song, more precisely from the very first riff of the very first song, the band seems to be proclaiming itself as ""The Next Great Band"" ready to join rock royalty. The intensity of the set is nothing short of astounding. Jonny is in top form, monumental riffs abound. Ed, a fantastic guitarist in his own right, adds just the right touches when called upon and blows the roof off the place, from time to time. Colin and Phil hypnotically keeping rythym, only hinting at what we would hear from them on subsequent records and Thom, well he is just being Thom. I've been a fan since Pablo Honey, with OK Computer and KID A being my favorite albums. I""ve seen them live twice, in 2001 and 2003, phenomenal shows but i also wish i would have been at this show. Live at Astoria will give you a greater appreciation of their earlier work. In a word; Mind-Blowing (or is that two words?)",1144800000,6,1126,4.444444444444445
2430679,2,B000BNXDEQ,"I have been a long-time radiohead fan and, like many others, have been waiting patiently for a live DVD.  So I was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist.  It never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old!

I couldn't help being disappointed when I watched this DVD.  The constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch.  In fact, I only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust.  I know I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime.

I've always that Radiohead was modern, progressive, and totally innovative.  I appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey... and it doesn't help that before every song, Thom mutters ""this is a new one.""",1141862400,13,889,4.547169811320755
2430680,2,B000BNXDEQ,"I love Radiohead.  Repeat, I love Radiohead.  They put out the best 4 albums in a row since the beatles in the 60's.  That being said...

This is the worst produced DVD I have ever seen.(!)  It features perhaps 8 cameras with random selection of camera choice at almost exactly 4 second intervals.  It is almost impossible to become interested in any part of the proceedings because you don't have the opportunity to watch any one of the fellas do ANYTHING for more than 4 seconds at a time.  I can't believe anyone allowed this to happen.  Who thought this was a good idea?  He (or she) should be forced to watch this abomination.  It's like staring into a strobe lite for an hour.

The only saving grace is that it is ""filmed"" at a time when the Band was beginning to ferment. Play it, but don't you dare watch or your likely to wind up in convulsions on the floor.

Come on boys, enough is enough.  Give us a good, modern DVD, in at least dolby 5.1.  I wouldn't care if you just used one camera.  Please.  Pretty please.

By the way.  Would everyone please drop any references to the band called Coldpl_y (sorry, my fingers won't allow me to type the complete name)?  How did Radiohead ever get linked with this completely unoriginal and mediocre band?",1138924800,81,1255,4.425438596491228
2430681,5,B000BNXDEQ,"""Radiohead: The Astoria London Live"" is worth a watch by anyone who hasn't been a fan from the beginning.  It is an electrifying performance from start to finish that chronicles the evolution of new material that would eventually end up on ""The Bends.""  It's hard to appreciate exactly how innovative and imaginative Radiohead is without watching them perform their intense, multi-layered parts.  If I'm a target audience, then here's my two-cents: I want more LIVE Radiohead.",1135814400,3,476,5.2368421052631575
2430682,5,B000BNXDEQ,"Radiohead live at the Astoria is a mindblowing moment in time caught before world-wide fame found the band. This performance is now some 11 years old and finds the band touring in support of the as yet released ""The Bends"". Being a long time fan of the band myself I found this disc to be like a breath of fresh air- a reminder of why the band is so talented and so original. While later works have become experimental it is  easy to see here on this DVD that when they choose to offer staight forward rock, Radiohead is head and shoulders above those who have tried to follow (Coldplay). I highly recommend this release for any Radiohead fan.",1135555200,4,643,4.4033613445378155
2430683,4,B000BNXDEQ,"The year was 1994. Radiohead was soon to release their brilliant sophomore album ""The Bends"" coming off of a large tour promoting their debut smash ""Pablo Honey.""  This concert mixes material from both. While I am definitely more of a fan of The Bends than Pablo Honey, it is always a delight to see ""Creep,"" their infamous hit single. Several other tracks from the first album stood out as well (most notably ""You"" and the grand finale of ""Blowout"" which is worth the price of admisson by itself.) Other highlights included ""The Bends"", ""My Iron Lung"", ""Just"", and a truly hypnotic ""Street Spirit."" Any fan of Radiohead would be insane not to own this (if not just to see Thom with his hair died blonde and Phil WITH HAIR.)

Overall, the songs range from good to mind-blowing which leaves the show with a rating of VERY GOOD. Jonny Greenwood is spectacular with the rest of the group feeding off of his wild energy. And as always, Thom Yorke is so entertaining to watch. This is what rock and roll is all about.",1135468800,33,1012,4.554945054945055

I will try to be as fair as I can...

I am more like an ""OK Computer-Amnesiac Era"" freak, and i hadn't listened their first 2 albums as much as i have done with the rest of them..

BUT, I must say that when I saw that live I was SHOCKED!!! This is one of the best live dvd's i've ever seen!!! Radiohead are such a FANTASTIC band!!! The songs are great! It's so nice to see the crowd's reaction when they here The Bends' songs for the first time.. I cannot imagine how i would react, if i heard Street Spirit or Fake Plastic Trees for the first time live...

But the greatest of all is the way these guys play those songs! Such power, such talent! Jonny Greenwood is one of the most talented guitar players alive!! Thom Yorke of course needs no coments... If you know about music, you should know about Thom... They're all great though! Even I (i already loved them so much) was surprised...

PS: Having the opportunity to see them play Creep live is also something very special... If you don't already know it, Radiohead NEVER play it in their gigs since lots of years..",1133827200,,1218,4.278260869565218

This includes Pablo Honey and The Bends material along with some other odds and ends. It is so mind blowing guitar driven it will give you chills and then Thom York's wonderful vocals will captivate you totally and completely. I honestly believe as they progressed after The Bends, their material became totally unlistenable. There's some amazing stuff post Bends but that is their Sgt. Pepper in my opinion. They definitely chilled out after The Bends. The one downfall of this DVD is that it's only in PCM stereo. That's really stupid but does sound great.

Now this DVD is for folks who love early 90's grungy Radiohead. The setlist played at this live concert is mostly a mix of songs from ""Pablo Honey"" and ""The Bends"". Performance wise, Radiohead delivers a great performance. However, the video editing is terrible. You get to see about two seconds of footage and then it cuts to another camera; this is how the entire concert is edited. It can be fairly irritating. This isn't a must have product from Radiohead.
