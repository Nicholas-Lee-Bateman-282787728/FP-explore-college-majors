8266932,5,B0017QWOEG,"Two funny George Michael's clips of a bit different gender and common unforgettable appearance:
""Shot the Dog"" is a cartoon epitomizing then US President G.W.Bush and UK PM T. Blaire with their intention to root out terrorism by changing Iraqi regime- a nice song and surely much more drag-queens involved performing quite comprehensible and understood than Yellow Submarin story itself
""Freek"" is a visually sexy theatrical musical of which language needs some preparation at school sex lessons while the rest is for a general viewing.

Very short DVD is nice for outstanding talents producers demonstrate.",1252972800,,607,5.389473684210526
