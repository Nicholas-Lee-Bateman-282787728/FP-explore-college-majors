7919734,2,B00004CIW3,"Somewhere in the woods, three poachers are searching for eggs in the night until a meteorite falls from space into the woods. A young boy who lives in the woods with his mom and uncle witnesses the whole thing with his telescope, a rock group lead by Rick (Ian Sera from Pieces) from the big city go into the woods for the weekend on a camping trip, meanwhile one of the hunters finds a cave where the meteorite landed as he discovers a horde of alien eggs and smashes them leaving only one as the alien mother is angry and kills him. The Mother goes out into the woods hunting and going on a killing spree, the young boy discovers the one egg as he takes it home with him and it hatches unleashing a cute but weird Anteater-esque alien and some members of the Rock groupie is being killed by the alien mother as they seek shelter in the boy's house.

A weird but messy Spanish-French Sci-fi horror film that was originally intended to be about evil aliens was changed to cash-in on E.T. as the director made an odd combination of John Carpenter's The Thing and E.T. together. The acting is quite bad i'm afraid as the plot makes no sense at all but i gotta say the anteater-aliens are original looking as they do original ways to kill people such as a powerful karate chop. The music is very Rick Wakeman-esque at times and sometimes it's suspenseful but still a bad movie.

Watch the MST3K version and it's the best episode ever.",1309824000,,1431,4.39622641509434
7919735,1,B00004CIW3,"Pod People, also known for its hilarious appearance on Mystery Science Theater 3000, is what you get when you cross; E.T. with Evil Dead. The end result is quite bad...

To give you a sample of this confusing plot, it deals with three stories...

(1) A little kid enthralled with bugs and rabbits, find a giant egg, meanwhile a (2) rock band goes on a trip to the woods, while (3) two poachers steal eggs.

These three plots co-mingle when one of the rock bands group is taunted and wanders off into the woods, only to be grabbed by a poacher for no reason, she then runs off a cliff...Meanwhile the kids giant egg hatches into a E.T. wannabe (Pod Person, I guess) and grows at an alarming rate. The Rock group arrives at the family cabin of Kid with thing, and the parents of the egg goes nuts after almost being captured by the two poachers. So we got rock band, kid, and good pod thing against bad pod creature outside.

I would get it, except it's unwatchable without Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1189900800,,1001,4.423913043478261
