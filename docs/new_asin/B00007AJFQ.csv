Her roots are dying of cancer and was radio's "" Sleepy Time Gal"" disc-jocky.
I really didn't like the movie, but the acting is pretty good, the story very humane.",1231804800,3,334,4.964285714285714
7974868,4,B00007AJFQ,"This is a movie that should only be viewed if you are ready to experience sadness in the examination of parental and personal relationships --- none of the relationships here are happy, and each has its secrets and disconnections. It expresses the sadness of a mother --- who has given up her daughter, acknowleging that she has missed many of the important life events of her daughter ---. I am an adoptee and recently united with my birth family who found me, in ways I could relate to the characters, but in other ways, I could not. However, it is well-worth watching, if you are willing to watch a drama that has a dark side.",1049500800,8,629,4.478260869565218
