2415960,5,B000BFY2HQ,"It is too bad that there are only 5 stars; it deserves more. As a spanish speaking father, I must disagree with one of the other reviews. Nothing can take the place of the parent in teaching a child spanish, especially a DVD. Unfortunately, many people do not understand this. There is no video that can teach a child a foreign language alone, thinking this is like expecting a child to know how to read just by watching Sesame Street. This video was obviously designed to supplement learning provided by parents. My family loves this video and my wife has even learned some spanish phrases, but only because we use them.",1139184000,8,621,4.603603603603603
2415961,5,B000BFY2HQ,"This is an excellent video!!  After reading the previous reviews I must express my opinion.  Being a mother of two boys under 4, I must say we have enjoyed the DVD immensely.  My boys love the puppetry, the music and we have all learned the simple phrases and words included in the first video.  In a previous review it was stated how the pronunciation was poor (gwacious), however, this is simply how children speak.  I feel they relate and understand this just fine.  We must learn the words then focus on pronunciation.  We speak English after all and my child may start with ""gwacious"" but will eventually say ""gracias"" as the narrator does.  I praise my children just for trying!  Thank you fiesta friends for introducing Spanish to a primarily English speaking family.  I can't wait for the next video....SEND MORE DVDS!!!!",1139097600,7,829,4.774647887323944
2415962,5,B000BFY2HQ,"As a media specialist in Colorado, I am always in search of quality bilingual products to add to my library collection. I purchased this video and put it in our parent section after reading the glowing reviews. I can hardly keep Fiesta Friends on the shelf. Teachers have been the main patrons checking out this video. I am so thankful for a video like this that allows anyone watching to learn simple beginner Spanish phrases. I cannot wait for the second video to come out so I can add that to our expanding bilingual collection.",1137628800,3,531,4.6
2415963,1,B000BFY2HQ,"It is unfortunate that DVD's cannot be returned after they've been opened. This DVD is horrible.  I would have given it 0 stars, if it was an option.  The DVD does not promote effective and long-term second language acquisition. All it does is translate. Unfortunately, translation does not help most people learn a second language because there is no long-term understanding. When words and phrases are translated, there is short-term comprehension, which is erased (from the brain) almost immediately, once the input stops. In class, a professor once said that translating words/phrases makes the brain lazy. The brain will not store the information for long-term use because it knows that it will immediately be translated into something it already knows.",1137456000,10,758,5.308333333333334
2415964,5,B000BFY2HQ,"I held off writing a review of this product, since most of the glowing comments that I had planned on making were already made by others.  However, a recent review spurred me into action.  In my view ""Fiesta Friends -- Tengo Hambre"" is perfect for native English speaking children who's parents are interested in language aquisition.  The puppets and situations are entertaining -- a must in children's programming.  The Spanish phrases are delivered in an accent that the children can understand and access with ease.  If the scenes were delivered only by native speakers, and the accents were correspondingly hard for little ears to follow -- children seeking (as were my own) to take a first step into a new language would have learned little.  In the end, then, ""Fiesta Friends"" is a perfect place for native English speaking children to begin -- a critical first step in a nation that is largely unilingual.  It is head and shoulders above the mindless clutter that makes up so much of the other educational childrens' programming.",1135728000,6,1036,4.919540229885057
2415965,2,B000BFY2HQ,"I was all excited to read the glowing reviews of this video and give it to my son who is 2 1/2 years old.  My husband is fluent in Spanish (his family is from Guatemala) and my son was born there.  This video is a severe disappointment.  The children repeating the sentences in spanish have poor pronounciation and so do many of the adults (many of whom have a Southern twang).  I believe that if you are wanting to teach a language, you NEED to have correct pronounciation at all times, not a child who says ""gwacias.""  It should have always been native speakers.  There is also too much emphasis on food; the puppets are annoying and some scenes are just pointless.

Oh well.  I wouldn't recommend this video at all.",1135641600,23,718,4.427480916030534
2415966,5,B000BFY2HQ,"Please get on line and buy this DVD right away!  There a just a few products on the market that teach Spanish to kids, but my family and I believe that Fiesta Friends is the best one by far!  Our children love the puppets (their favorite is Fuerte!) and really get a kick out of the interaction between the on-screen kids and the characters.  Our youngest child laughs every time at the same spots. Most importantly, my wife and I are noticing that many of the Spanish words and expressions are working their way into the everyday vocabulary of our two young kids (4 and 3 years old!).  This aspect of easy assimilation more than anything else demonstrates the effectiveness of this DVD. Our oldest child (15 years) also enjoys the humor, art, and music of Fiesta Friends and is learning Spanish right along with the other kids.  This product really is for the whole family!

Fiesta Friends: Tengo Hambre is entertaining, fun, the music is catchy, and truly makes learning Spanish an accessible family event.  I highly recommend this wonderful DVD to everyone who wants to have a blast teaching their children Spanish.  My whole family is eagerly awaiting the next installment.  Bravo to Jeanne Keene M.Ed and the whole Fiesta Friends LLC production crew!",1130630400,9,1255,4.773148148148148
2415967,5,B000BFY2HQ,"My daughter and I watched this video the other night for the first time and we are already able to use some of the vocabulary in our daily lives. At 5 years old, most of the other language programs that we looked in to made her feel a little inadequate and frustrated because they are over her head. Fiesta friends, however, was fun and educational for the both of us! It is great for children of all ages (including me). We are looking forward to future videos!",1127260800,10,462,4.32183908045977
2415968,5,B000BFY2HQ,"I am very pleased with this educational DVD.  My grandchildren can now say many Spanish words.  My daughter, their mother, has enjoyed teaching them and learning Spanish herself.  In fact it became a family project.

I think, in our world today, learning a second language is almost a necessity and I feel it improves cognitive ability.",1126915200,8,336,4.946428571428571
8086251,4,B000BFY2HQ,"I knew what I was purchasing prior to ordering this dvd. I had rented it multiple times from the library. This is not to be relied upon in order to truly teach the language, but is a great introductory and educational tool. I put this on as opposed to just sticking my little one in front of sprout. Volume 2 is definitely the better video though.",1360108800,,347,4.2727272727272725
8086252,2,B000BFY2HQ,"This could have been a really fun video for teaching some basic Spanish words to children.  But I'm just in shock about some of the people that narrate or star in this.  I hate to be mean, because they are obviously well-meaning.  But the Spanish accent of all but one of them is so atrocious as to actually be detrimental to learning Spanish.

One male narrator seems to be bilingual, as in he may have learned Spanish at home.  But he obviously grew up in the United States.  A real native speaker would have been ideal, I think, but he is passable.  The other adult and children are horrendous.

This video looks like it was produced at the University of Wisconsin, which confuses me, because everyone in this video seems to have a strong Southern accent (I lived in Oklahoma for 3 years, so I don't think I'm mistaken).  Even in English, it's kind of grating when you aren't used to it anymore.  It kind of sounds like a ""you might be a redneck"" routine.  I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude.  People can't help their local accent - it's just surprising for what I thought was going to be a professional video.

But the English is forgivable.  The Spanish accents are not.  I do not know what the excuse is for an adult to speak Spanish with a Southern drawl on an educational video.  The children are even worse, which they can't help, since they are obviously not native speakers and are just reading or repeating a phrase.  But this could only work if the children were native speakers.

Oh, it's so awful.  It could have been really cute, but I feel like I need to turn the volume down and say the words myself so that the accent is correct (I'm not even a native speaker, but I know what correct pronunciation sounds like).  This was a nice attempt.

I have to say that I'm watching a version from the library which may be older, just in case they decided to fix these glaring defects in a later edition.  If not, please do!",1200441600,13,1932,4.367977528089888
8086253,1,B000BFY2HQ,"This product had great intentions, but disappoints severely.  There are virtually no native Spanish speakers used in the film, which is essential in proper acquisition of pronunciation.  I am a certified language teacher, so can speak from experience.
So, unless you don't care if your kids speak Spanish with a bad accent, don't buy this product.  If you want your kids to learn the correct accent, look elsewhere (even Baby Einstein Language Nursery features native speakers).",1198540800,3,478,5.2631578947368425
8086254,5,B000BFY2HQ,We have 5 children of varying ages - all have learned from this DVD.  It's just playful and fun - not  the best production ever - but I and our children have picked up words and phrases we use at dinnertime.,1172448000,2,207,4.024390243902439
8086255,1,B000BFY2HQ,"This is aweful!  Horrible Spanish, ""spoken"" by non Spanish speakers with a bad gringo accent.  It is truly one of the worst things I have seen ever.  And also horrible typos in the written sections.  This is the most pathetic thing I have seen.

Avoid this like the plague.

8086257,1,B000BFY2HQ,"I agree entirely with Maria Maria's review. It is a great concept and a TERRIBLE production. Poor pronunciation and grammar mistakes throughout. I highly recommend NOT purchasing this DVD. If I could give it zero stars, I would.",1163030400,9,228,5.026315789473684
8086258,5,B000BFY2HQ,"My 4 year old started taking Spanish in Pre-K.  I asked another

parent if she knew of any Spanish tapes or CD's that my child might enjoy and learn with.  She told me of a Children's

Store selling CD's called Mommy Teach Me Spanish.  She said her

two children loved it.  After purchasing the CD my daughter fell

in love with it.  She loves the animation and above all the

other children that speak Spanish.  This CD has added lots of

fun and learning to our family.  I watch in with my child and

we both learn and play.  I have recommended it to my friends that

have children.  We just purchased the new CD about ""Sweet Dreams""

and love it even more.  I found this review site searching to

see if anything new had been released.  Thank You allowing reviews",1149033600,7,766,4.290780141843972

8086260,1,B000BFY2HQ,"Cute chihuahua on the cover, but this is a really bad ""spanish language"" DVD. They use terrible pronunciation that you don't want your children to learn, spoken by children AND adults who obviously DO NOT speak spanish (not even as a second language). There are mistakes in gender (""el hamburguesa"" is one example) and there are glaring mistakes in phrasing that no fluent spanish speaker would use (not in Mexico, not in South America, not in Spain.. nowhere). If this had been edited by a linguist, or at least a real fluent spanish speaker, these problems might have been corrected. They were not. Music CDs in spanish with an accompanying book with lyrics are better, and reading books written in spanish with your child is very good. But don't waste your money on this DVD. I'm still searching for good teaching aids, and might have to spend the big bucks on a Berlitz cd/dvd (if they have a series for children). I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one.",1145491200,26,968,4.633720930232558
