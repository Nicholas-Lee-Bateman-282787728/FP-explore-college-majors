7984662,3,B00008J2OM,"I thought this low-budget creature movie is actually good, although it has a complete lack of graphic violence. The films gore content isn't much. Most of the deaths are off-screen, and you see some body parts lying around here and there. However, the non-CGI creatures look good. As for the nudity, there's a pretty good amount. There's topless scenes and some rear nudity, but it contains no explicit sexual scenes. The locations that they used are nice. It takes place out in woods, which is a good setting for this type of monster film, but the entire thing would've been so much better if they included some good gore. With the exception of some parts, most of the movie moves pretty well. It's also easy to follow, and I thought the directing was pretty good. The main problem with it is that when I buy these low-budget monster movies, I want to at least see a couple of good gore sequences. I don't know if the budget prevented them from showing any graphic scenes or if it was their decision, but that hurt the film. I'll still give it three and a half stars.

The full screen DVD looks very good. It has no good extras. You just get some trailers and a useless and very quick photo gallery. I see that you can now get this movie in that 8 film DVD set, and it's also on YOUTUBE.",1447113600,,1288,4.389121338912134
7984663,3,B00008J2OM,"During the opening credits we find out this is a ""Dirty Martini"" production. Early in the film, the man who finances the expedition drinks dirty martinis made by a topless pool girl. Coincidence? I think not. Dr. Brinson Thomas (Pete Penuel) assembles a crack team including young co-eds that work cheaply, to find a missing tribe in the Everglades, most likely connected to the thing we did not see that killed two people before the credits. Hopefully these girls like to take showers because they can't act

Brian Minyard plays Wilson Friels a bad actor who is made to look sinister with a goatee. He is financing the expedition, plans on going along and has an undisclosed ulterior motive. During the first night camping, Friels tells the legendary story about the lost tribe and the creature. They discover the ransacked camp and human remains. They want to leave the island, but the boat won't be back for a few days. No sense packing a radio. The creature appears to be manufactured from the same high-tech polymer NASA uses in their space shuttle tires.

You could watch worse. This movie is available in a 4-pack with 3 other films not worth watching. That would be the best way to go.

7984664,2,B00008J2OM,"You'd think in a movie made in 2000, you wouldnt expect to see monsters in rubber suits.  WRONG!  That's only one of the many ingredients in this almost campy horror flick.  DEADLY SPECIES gives us the usual billionaire business man out on a mysterious expedition.  A kindly professor, his wife and several of his ""best"" students, who all act like prepubescent idiots.  Only the studly bodyguard for the businessman exudes any kind of presence, and his role is certainly not challenging.  A muddled plot, bad pacing and just all around foolishness make DEADLY SPECIES a rental on an All Night Bad Movie Fest.",1102118400,4,608,4.854368932038835
7984665,1,B00008J2OM,"What posessed me to buy this drivel I don't know. It was so bad it could have been made by Aaron Spelling. A combination of bad acting, bad script, bad direction/makeup/production. Completely lacking in tension or horror and full of cliches.
Until now the worst film I had ever seen was ""Raising Arizona"" - until now! Thank goodness there were no extras - the mind boggles as to what they might have done with a ""making of""!
Pity that Amazon.com doesn't permit no stars in the review - cos that's what this would have scored.",1058659200,7,525,4.536842105263158
7984666,3,B00008J2OM,"As only the B&W classic drive-in movies could do, or a Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie could do, this is the classic, cheesy,and fun B movie.  Deadly Species is funny and dopey and almost good.  It's got all the elements.....bad sound, bad music, gratutious nude scenes with pretty girls, some blood and gore, and of course foam-rubber customed men running around killing people.  It won't be up for any awards but Deadly Species is a fun movie to sit around and make fun of on a Saturday night with some friends, some chips and beer.",1052179200,9,537,4.631578947368421
