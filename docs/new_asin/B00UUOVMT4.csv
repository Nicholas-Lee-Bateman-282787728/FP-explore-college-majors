7071321,1,B00UUOVMT4,FLIGHT WW 2 IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN!! THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE VERY BAD! THE BEST PART OF THIS MOVIE WAS THAT IT WASN'T LONGER. WHAT A WADTE OF TIME!!! DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE.,1434672000,4,193,3.85
7071322,1,B00UUOVMT4,"There are very few alternate history films  made of the time travel variety in existence, The Final Countdown serving as the best example of this genre.

Write by: Jacob Cooney & Bill Hanstock.

Directed by : Emile Edwin Smith.

Absolutely loved this flick, Hands down one of the best we have seen this year and miles above any from Those SHARKNADO peoples.

Started off thinking,Hey this isn't a Mockbuster,Huh ?

Been accused of being a Final Countdown ( 1980) remake ?,Really, That was a long time ago and big studios have been remaking stuff from just a few years back since ever.

Acting is so good & real,Some effects were also right on like all the plane stuff,Some of the situations involving the wounded plane are to be forgived.",1433289600,7,650,4.758928571428571
7071324,3,B00UUOVMT4,"Watching this show once was more than enough...but I kept hoping that the story line would develop, but it never grew into its possibilities.

The biggest claim to fame of this movie was that Faran Tahir was the plane captain....better known as the captain of the ill fated USS Kelvin in Star Trek (2009).  That in itself made the movie watchable for me and pulled me through to the end.

I like sci-fi and I like war movies, so this looked like an interesting, though totally cheesy possibility.  So I bit and gave it a look.  Once it got going it was kind of like watching a train wreck...you just know it's going to be terrible, but you just can't look away.  And yes, it ends up being pretty terrible, so terrible in fact that it's not all that bad.

SPOILER ALERT

An ""International Airlines"" airliner was flying somewhere over the Atlantic was forced to fly through a strange atmospheric storm-like anomaly and when they emerges it's gone from afternoon to nighttime and they are flying somewhere over land.  The plane's radio gear is working but there's no one on the air.  Yes, you got it, the screenwriters used the exact same plot twist that was used was used in the 1980 movie, ""The Final Countdown"" where the USS Nimitz was transported back to December 1941.

This time however, the airliner is over 1940 WWII Europe.

A couple of apparently happy-go-lucky history professors with expertise in 20th century history, especially WWII, just happen to be on board and they are the ones who reach the conclusion that they have gone back in time.

Before you know it the plane is buzzed by German Me 262 jet fighters - a plane type that was not in service until years later.  Also, they finally make contact with someone on the ground who's in the British Army and they learn that Dunkirk was a disaster with hundreds of thousands of allied troops killed or captured - the plane passengers learn that history has somehow changed.  This is of course an interesting time-travel alternative reality premise that's a favorite of sci-fi writers, but sadly little was done with it in this film.

OK, I do have a few major issues with some of the action, especially when the Me 262s make multiple attack runs at the airliner. The Me 262s were faster than the airliner and were armed with four 30 mm cannons.  There were at times as many as four fighters attacking at once.  The movie shows many shots striking home, but inside no one is hit and frankly the fuselage doesn't really incur any damage.  What were the fighters shooting?  Ping pong balls?!  Ha ha.  Also there is a surface to air missile shot at the plane at one point, and no such system existed until after WWII. Of course fans can claim an alternative history, and sure, that's ok, but super unlikely.

I know this is a very low budget film, and it feels largely that way.  The part that comes across as terribly low-rent are the scenes on the ground when their ground contact is shown.

There is very little resolution to the whole movie, though there is an interesting plot twist at the very end of the film that's fun.

All in all this is only a reasonably fun time.  I didn't hate or dislike it, and deem it IMO officially ""okay.""  Thus the 3 stars.

There is little particularly original or engaging about the show, and it is just not quite good/bad enough to qualify as a cult classic like Sharknado.

Everyone in the film plays it straight.  This makes it a bit funny.

All in all, it's OK -  3 stars",1467763200,,3471,4.511217948717949

7071326,3,B00UUOVMT4,They say it happened for real I don't think so  A 757 bound for London in 2015 Some how ends up going threw time to 1940 but what surprised me is I also say the first german jet fighters that did not come out until 1945  so how are they able to keep this A secret there's plenty of drama  and some action the cast was alright special effects ok.,1461456000,,345,3.9
7071327,4,B00UUOVMT4,"This movie was fun.  I was surprised.  The performances were not as cheesy as you might expect. Of special note is Aqueela Zoll.  She is really quite good in this.  Quite good and quite HOT.  Keep an eye out, she's talented...I think we'll be hearing a lot from her.",1461456000,,266,4.346938775510204
7071328,5,B00UUOVMT4,"I wasn't expecting much, however, it was really fun.  I thought the actor playing the pilot (Faran Tahir) held the film together.  Sure it's a bit forced here and there, but, the director kept everyone in character and the acting, for this kind of low budget movie was good.  Again, especially Faran Tahir.  So for me, a guy looking for a new take on a WWII movie, this movie was quite enjoyable and never let me down.  There are some interesting historical twists that, as a history buff, made my spine tingle as the film presents the viewer with alternate historical possibilities.  A great night's entertainment and a nice European western front version of Final Countdown.  What are you waiting for, take the leap.  Rent it!

A note about the cover art.  They illustrate ME-109s as playing a front and center roll.  They don't.  The film actually features another Luftwaffe craft within an alternate version of WWII history.  Fun.",1458864000,,934,4.79874213836478
7071329,5,B00UUOVMT4,"They claim this is based on a true story but I find that hard to believe. There was an episode of the Twilight Zone that dealt with this situation that is science fiction. Right? Right!? Once again, some reputable sources claim this actually happened. Only time will tell, every pun intended. A modern passenger jet airliner finds itself back in the middle of World War 2 in Europe! This changes everything and apparently did, FOR REAL. This is a movie from The Asylum group that is shockingly good, much better than their Sharknado garbage. Action galore and suspense personified! I rate this movie PG-13 for violence and language. A secret part of history revealed! Enjoy!",1458777600,3,674,4.869565217391305

This belongs on a list of ""So bad it's good"" movies...

SPOILER ALERT: i like how they handled the fact that there were no airports capable of safely landing a modern commercial airliner back in WWII by not having the plane land in the past at all. Heh.",1442448000,,469,4.571428571428571

It was a fun movie and they took some creative liberties to accomplish what they wanted to. I had laughs and liked it over all. I was oping the ending would be that they didn't fix time and the world was all different, but no big deal.",1441584000,,393,3.925

7071343,1,B00UUOVMT4,"I have a difficult time understanding the positive reviews for this movie. I cannot fault the actors as it is hard to know how competent they might be given the script. The lines are not quite cheesy enough to be funny and the plot jumps from one unlikely incident to the next impossible one.

We are all used to seeing impossible feats of technical wizardry that save the day in Hollywood movies but to think that you can remove the radar from a commercial jet while in flight and drop it by parachute to your allies below is a bit too far fetched. This movie then goes to a whole new level when they expect us to believe that an English soldier with WWII-level technology could connect this device to clean power at the level it requires not to mention to a workable antenna. Add to this the leap we have to assume that this soldier suddenly knows how to operate the radar and interpret what he sees on the display.

This movie could have been campy and funny or it could have been made as an interesting bit of science fiction / alternate history. As it was it left me wishing it had only existed in a parallel timeline and not in this one.",1440979200,,1143,4.311627906976744

7071351,5,B00UUOVMT4,"I haven't been able to think about anything else since I watched this movie last night. I was so thoroughly sucked into this documentary, so many things I'd never learned in my ""government funded"" education.

I am wondering why they don't use 757's as gun-ships in the military, as it's obvious that they withstand hundreds of bullets and rocket strikes with no real damage.

Most of all thank you to all these unheralded heros for saving the world in 1940.",1440547200,2,457,4.7
7071352,4,B00UUOVMT4,"Grab some snacks and settle in!  This is so hysterically bad it's in a class all its own.  The lead actor (who I've seen in a number of character parts) does his best to be suitably serious as the captain of a passenger airliner that's sucked back to war-torn Europe in 1940.

7071354,3,B00UUOVMT4,"The first time I saw this one thing  I realized that it was science fiction: too much leg room. And the main aisle was too wide. Seriously, this was one of the better Asylum movies. A sort of Philadelphia  Experiment in the air. I saw it on Netflix August 2015. I had some cabin pressure  issues when a hole blasted open but overall one of the better movies to come out of The Asylum. The exposition was not as blatant  in this one.

7071360,1,B00UUOVMT4,"Very thought provoking - if you're 8 years old. For grown-ups, it is an old premise, done much better many years ago. Wooden acting, and bad history to boot.",1439078400,2,157,4.448275862068965
7071361,3,B00UUOVMT4,"This movie surprised me. I wasn't expecting much, but it was very entertaining and I dare say engaging. The special effects are nothing to write home about. However, the story line is exceptional. I'd never heard of any of the actors. Most of them are fairly good. I especially like the fact that they hired an aviation consultant. The aircraft portrayed is a Boeing 757. Exterior ""shots"" of the aircraft are consistent. To me, nothing is more annoying than when different types of aircraft portray one model. Examples are Red Eye and United 93. The way the flight crew handle the yoke is laughable, but it has dramatic effect. All in all, this is a well written film. I think this could have been a major hit had it had a proper budget.",1438992000,,737,4.548872180451128
7071362,4,B00UUOVMT4,"FLIGHT WORLD WAR II falls into the category of time travel films that focus on the dangers of changing history.  A modern day 747 jet airliner flies through a mysterious temporal window in the sky that brings to mind a similarly themed episode from TWILIGHT ZONE and a nearly identical plot device from THE LANGOLIERS.  The jet appears in France in June 1940 but this June is not the one that the pilot and crew know of. Here, the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk was annihilated and the Luftwaffe has jets. Clearly, in this time line the Nazis are doing much better than their counterparts in the other time line. The 747 jet is a marvel of modern technology and the pilot must decide whether to give the British the jet's radar system or risk it falling into German hands.  The special effects are surprisingly good for a low budget Assylum film. The acting is believable. Recommended.",1438732800,2,893,4.67515923566879

7071368,4,B00UUOVMT4,"This is a revamped way of presenting an old concept. The plot: a modern day commercial international air flight is flying along on a perfectly clear and beautiful day, then out of nowhere an electrical disturbance appears directly in their flight path, they decide to fly through the disturbance instead of around it. Once they make it through the disturbance, it's night time and they find themselves in the middle of a war zone, turns out the disturbance has thrown them back to the year 1940 and they flying through a major German air assault on France. They have less than an hour of fuel remaining, there is nowhere for them to land and both the Germans and the Allies are trying to blow them out of the sky, the German's because they have no idea who they are and assume their a threat, the Allies because they've managed to establish radio contact with the plane and with it being from our time the Allies are not willing to run the risk of an airplane from 75 years in the future falling in German hands. In addition to the problems going on outside of the plane, there are problems inside as well. One of the passengers is of a mind to take the plane and go kill Hitler and stop the war and prevent the holocaust because he has a history book that tells him exactly where and when Hitler will be located on any given day....I liked this movie it had good acting, and a believable plot and characters .  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought there should have been some Asian people included in the cast to make it more visually diverse.  Granted the plane is flying from England to Germany and in real life there probably wouldn't have been many people of Asian decent on such a flight, but that is the only flaw I have with the film.",1436054400,,1767,4.367781155015198
