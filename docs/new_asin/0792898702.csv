156511,5,0792898702,"A very good series. I recently got into watching anime an I must say this is a great choice. Voice actors did a great job an the whole post apocalytic theme sets the movie off. If u into anime, id suggest watching this series.",1342137600,,226,4.159090909090909
156512,5,0792898702,"Hokuto No Ken / Fist Of The North Star is truly a classic ! Great story, Awesome Characters, Top Chara design, Great music... If you've never seen it, you're missing something !",1315180800,,177,4.5625
156513,5,0792898702,"First off, I have to say that it's absolutely great to see that Discotek Media has brought over the original Hokuto No Ken 1 series (The first 109 episodes).  A lot of people who were unfamiliar with this anime in the USA now has the chance to witness a legendary anime.  I've been a Fist of the North Star / Hokuto No Ken fan for the last 5 to 6 years.  If you love martial arts, post apocalyptic settings, and a deep story woven in between this is for you.  So much that was done in this show influenced much of the anime afterwards such as Dragon ball Z, Naruto, and etc.  Considered one of the manliest animes, (alongside Sakigake Otokojuku, which is another underrated classic) the action and storylines presented in this anime will have you a fan instantly.  This box set presents the concluding episodes to the series which leads up to one of the best endings I have seen from an anime.  Pick this up while you can and support the people bringing you this great anime!",1312156800,5,975,4.383333333333334
156514,5,0792898702,"One of the best anime's I've seen. I saw all 152 Episodes in the English Laungage for sale on Ebay for $28,000.00 and its legit.",1311811200,,128,4.16
156515,5,0792898702,This movie is a cult classic.  If you you like brutal fight oriented animation this is the movie that set the bar.,1249776000,,114,4.181818181818182
156516,5,0792898702,"Fist of the North Star is the best anime I've ever seen! The animation is amazing for its time and every anime I've seen so far hasn't even come close to the greatness of this anime. Granted that the anime wasn't geared toward kids like other animes, but that still doesn't change the fact that this anime is awesome. The story line is great and keeps you glued to the screen begging for more action. Word of the wise: Don't ever mess with Kenshiro or like the bad guys in the anime, you WILL REGRET IT! Ken is certainly the protecter the people of this time needed as well as the two children Bart and Lynn that followed him on his journey. Remember: violence isn't the problem; IT'S THE SOLUTION!",1244937600,,698,4.376923076923077

156518,5,0792898702,One of my favorite anime series for sure. It's out of print so I decided to try buying a used one. I'm glad I did because now I can enjoy this series all over again. It arrived quick and in great condition. Thanks so much!,1229904000,,222,3.9555555555555557
156519,3,0792898702,"In a post-nuclear future world where water and food are scarce and nothing seems to grow from the earth, those who are strongest rule. One such man is called Kenshiro, and he is the successor of the Hokuto Shinken fighting style which uses pressure points to destroy the opponent's body from within. When Ken's woman is stolen from him by his former friend, he is left for dead and his older brothers each attempt to replace him as the new Fist of the North Star. Ken is not dead, however, and returns stronger than ever. He journeys to reclaim his lost love, fighting evil gangs along the way and picking up two young sidekicks, a boy named Bart and a special little girl named Lynn. Through his quest, he is forced to do battle with his old friend and both of his brothers in an effort to defeat those who would prevent rebirth in the radiation ravaged world.

 Playing out much like a spaghetti western or grindhouse flick, ""Fist of the North Star"" is rather entertaining in terms of action, violence, and gore. Plenty of heads explode, and superhuman strength and size seems to abound in the future. The story is rather simple, and yet the film leaves the viewers with some questions in the end about certain key characters disappearing or having out-of-nowhere changes of heart. Overall, I'd say this is worth seeing if you like grindhouse type revenge films or martial arts focused Anime, and it's definitely an important film to see for animation fans. I'm not a big fan of this particular style of Anime (I tend to prefer the cleaner looking types with lots of cute, big-eyed girls in short skirts), but this is one of the first Anime features to be a hit in the U.S. (dubbed into English in 1991), making it historically significant to the fan of film and animation. The film was originally released in 1986, and before that it was a TV series and a manga. A live-action movie and other productions have been made since. The U.S. VHS release, by the way, contains the true original ending, though some mistakenly believe the other ending is the original.",1190246400,2,2063,4.618528610354224
156530,4,0792898702,"The reviews for this item  are about the LIVE ACTION FILM  and not Volume 5 of the TV series Fist Of The North Star derived from the serialized strip and manga of the same name. This review is ACTUALLY about Fist Of The North Star Volume 5 which contains episodes 29-36 in the 1984 Toei Animation series.

The 5th DVD in this collection follows the Fang Clan/Toki storyline of the series. Ken is the Heir Of Hokuto Shinken, the LONE practioner/possessor of the power of the School Of The Great Bear. This series is an offshoot of the manga. Those of you that saw the ANIME FILM FIRST WILL BE CONFUSED AS HELL BY THE SERIES!

The film came TWO YEARS AFTER THE TV SERIES WAS PRODUCED. In the film Julia/Yulia/Yuria lives. In the manga/series she dies. In the film Rei dies. In the manga/series he lives. Raoh DOES NOT MAKE AN APPEARANCE IN THE SERIES...HE IS SHOWN AND MENTIONED BUT IS NEVER ENCOUNTERED. Toki appears (sort of) in the series/manga BUT NOT IN THE MOVIE...HE IS NEVER EVEN MENTIONED!

Bart (or Bat as he's known in the manga) and Lynne are with Ken throughout the 36 episodes, as are a few friends that end up dead and finish with Mamiya, the warrior woman. At the end of the series, you realize that it was made so that ANOTHER 36 EPISODES WERE FORTHCOMING...IT NEVER HAPPENED. I'll fill you in on what comes next (hint: The New Fist Of The North Star and Movie explained it).

Ken hunts for Toki, he runs into Raoh's minions and beats them all with Mamiya, Rei, Bart and Lynne in tow. He never finds Toki. Mamiya dies. Rei dies. He fights Raoh and beats him. Raoh sees he was wrong and pays respect to Ryuken's grave. He comes back and Ken becomes his advisor/counselor. Raoh has a son. Ken agrees to teach Raoh's son since he is the only heir to Hokuto Shinken. Ken leaves AGAIN to find Toki....he ends up in The New Fist Of The North Star. Confused? Of course you are! If you're not a fan of the series and need closure on how the quest pans out then don't bother yourself. If you are then you better try looking on the internet for all of the Fist stories you can find. One.",1127865600,5,2092,4.337595907928389
156531,2,0792898702,"Fist of the North Star is so unbelievably retardation-inducing it's hilarious. In that sense, and that sense alone, it is entertaining. But...my God, I don't even know where to begin in critiquing that show. So I'll just say the first couple of things that enter my mind. That girl, Lynn, is the most absurdly high-pitched annoyance out of all the main female characters - everytime I hear her say ""Ken!, my ears feel like Kenshiro himself has punctured them. She serves as a perpetual reminder of why I converted to manga in the first place (lack of painful audio). I swear, she and the other kid must have only been put in the series to mock other anime children. Julia is not beautiful, just annoying. It's as pathetically simplistic as an NES game, but without the nostalgic or warm feelings. The artwork is horrendous.

This anime makes the Mortal Kombat movies look like martial arts masterpieces and Ranma 1/2 look serious.

As for the rest of the critique, I think it would be best for me to simply transcribe the gorgeously non-cliched script:

You're already dead!

You're already dead!

YURIAAAAA (Julia) !

YURIAAAAA (Julia) !

YURIAAAAA (Julia) !

YURIAAAAA (Julia) !

HELL HELL HELL!

Pressure point attack!

Pressure point attack!

Pressure point attack!

Love me Julia, love me! LOVE ME!

Evil bad people disturb our village!

Evil bad people disturb out village!

Sorry for the spam, but I figured some would enjoy it, since some enjoy the show.",1113696000,4,1462,4.834677419354839
156532,5,0792898702,"It's with great pleasure that I review for ""Fist Of The North Star"".

After writing several number one reviews, I will write a great review for this incredible anime.

Fist of The North Star is based on the manga by Tetsuo Hara which has been one of the top anime fan picks ever!!!

It's based on a post nuclear society in which their is no law. Only the strong shall survive.

Kenshiro , the hero of our story is part several brothers of the Hotushin school of Martial Arts. His brothers Jagi, Toki and his friend Shin all were honest, fighters, but all their hearts became evil. Jagi became jealous with envy after the leader of the school chose Kenshiro as the new leader of the school.

Jagi tries to kill his brother, but Kenshiro using several moves including his ""North Star Death Fist"" stops Jagi and leaves Jagi face disfigured and ugly.

But this is only the beginning as Kenshiro, remeniscent of the Clint Eastwood Western character, travels to place to place battling Evil and giving hope and entertainment to the people he meets.

The school of Hotoshinken is destroyed and two factions are

the Fist of North Star (Kenshiro) and the Fist of the South

Star. The South Star led by Lord Shin uses their martial

skills for murder and power and to terrorize people.

Kenshiro, in the movie and in the series from the 80's showcases

his amazing arsenal of moves that he uses to kill the evildoers,

of course his specialty is finding and attacking the ""special

power points"" of his enemies and then literally blowing them

up in pieces via spontaneous combustion.

Adding to Kenshiro's fury is the fact that Shin, has kidnapped

the love of his love, Julia, and the fact that Shin has scarred

his body with seven scars, thus the ""Man with seven scars""

is born.

Fantastic action!!! Unbelievable moves and many groundbreaking animation scenes make ""Fist Of The North Star"" one of the greatest anime ever made.",1097971200,,1922,4.663690476190476
156533,4,0792898702,"Here we go again. Kenshiro continues on his quest to rid the earth of worthless scum and uphold the honor of Hokuto Shinken. Heads explode and fists do indeed fly.  Some of these episodes delve into Ken's past (a nice change) and we get introduced to his three adoptive brothers who all veying to be the true successor of their father's martial art ""Hokuto Shinken"".
As a nice bonus, you get a few extra episodes on this disc (compared to the previous 4).  Still, one thing left me scratching my head..this isn't the end,not by a long shot! Yes I did check...Kenshiro still has a few more fights in him, but its up to Manga Ent to acquire the rights and put out the rest (quickly, let's hope).
Back to the DVD..audio and video are satisfactory.  Obviously I recommend the Japanese language track with subs (hey, its the way it was meant to be!) Just sit back, relax and watch the Ken dispatch foe after foe with skill and the line ""You are already dead"". You won't regret it.",1078531200,,975,4.435754189944134
156534,2,0792898702,"I enjoyed this. It was on one of those starz movie channels and I got to see the first 4 episodes. It is alright. Ken, a.k.a. Kenshiro, is pretty cool. The boy Bart is a little out of place. He just shows up and trusts this strange martial artists who can kill guys with insanely weird moves. The girl also seems out of her element.
The fights are alright, but the juice of the episodes are the kills. Every episode has these weird deaths like ""exploding fingers"" or ""your dead in 7 seconds from my fingers in your neck"". Stuff like that happens.
The problem with these episodes is animation. There is only, mabye 2 scenes you can consider fights. Almost every other death is by some weird killing move that lasts a few seconds but requires 2 clips of animation. Then, instead of showing the actual guys fall apart, they make the screen all bright and you see the shadow of the guys go all squishy and fall apart. Not cool.
On top of that. There is so little animation that it is a little infuriating. It almost feels like the creators tried to use one frame at least twice. I remember seeing 6 cars speeding through a city. 2 cars sped across followed by 4 others. The 4 other cars were just clones of the first 2. You could clearly see the exact same people go across the screen 3 times. As I said earlier, the fights all involve one or 2 moves. A frame is one little shot of the characters. I'd say it takes about 5 frames for a character in Dragonball Z to punch someone slowly. There may be 10 different frames tops to one fight in this anime. It is almost pathetic.
Normally I don't have high expectations. I'm satisfied by even the lowest animation if there is a story or something interesting. I remember seeing tons of old animes that had bad animation but still kept my interest. This seriously though has to be some of the worst use of animating I have ever seen. If Ken wasn't so awesomely cool I would of given this DVD 1 star.",1073088000,,1940,4.30327868852459
156535,5,0792898702,"It was a beautifully intricate blend of flavors that make this a classic.  I laughed and cried at its beauty..........  The ecstacy is similar to the ecstacy felt that you would recive if you arrived in heaven, looked into god's face, and he said, ""You, you are my most wonderous creation.  Come, be with me.""  The most touching, heart felt, truly powerful piece that ever graced my vision.  I would rather die than have not have seen it in its glory.

156536,5,0792898702,"It was such an epic, that it made me shed a tear or two.  The drama rivals that of 'Gone With the Wind'.  A must buy.",1067040000,,117,3.4615384615384617
156537,4,0792898702,"""You are already dead"" A phrase uttered by the main star Kenshiro, many a time, after performing one of his numerous killing techniques. The dialogue is a little cheesy , the bad-guys cookie-cutter,the animation primitive, but so what?  This DVD is chock-full of violence and cool martial arts.  Definetely watch this series in order, to understand the back-story and why the hell Ken is tromping around wasting baddies.
You get 7 episodes, very adequate compared to other companies. *cough*Funimation*cough. Audio in English and Japanese, with Subtitles.  Let's be honest...you don't want to listen to this in english. The voice acting is really bad (read:Atrocious dialogue), and will make you run home crying. Stick to the Japanese track with subs, and you'll be fine.
Extras are the same old Manga previews from the previous disc,kinda dissapointing.  All in all, a great buy...dont miss it!",1064707200,,895,5.2377622377622375
156538,4,0792898702,"The Animation in this Fist of The North Star TV series is not the best. In fact they look pretty silly. But if you look past this (it was after all made in the mid-1980s) the Disc contains 210 minutes of escapism (especially for Manga fans). But the DVD does have its moments particularly when the animation freezes to announce Kenshiro's fighting moves. Excellent Stuff. This DVD contains the Episodes 8-14 of the Series and can be viewed in both English Dub and the Original Japanese language. I would advise most people to watch it in English simply because the characters look ""Western"" and hence it sounds rather strange in Japanese.
Finally one has to Buy this DVD for the Episode Titles Alone. For Example:
1:STRIKE THE HIDDEN POWER POINT! No Requiem For The Wicked
2:VILLIANS! Say Your Prayers Before You Die!
3:RAGING FLAME REVERSE FLOW PUNCH! There Are Too Many Who Must Die!
4:VILLIANS! Listen To The Blues Of Hell!
5:I AM DEATH! I Will Chase You To The Ends Of Hell!
6:THE ARHAT DEVA FIST! Once Unleashed, There's No Holding It Back!
7:A MISERABLE AGE! Good People Die So Young!

7792596,5,0792898702,"As Volume 2, so was Volume 3 only released in USA with English subtitles only. However, true FOTNS fans won't be deterred by this, as it's not hard to read the subtitles, if you love the show. I love the show with all my heart, so I gladly read, while I watched. It was a privilege also, to see the conclusion of the first series that center around Kenshiro, Raoh, and Julia.

In Volume 3, We are introduced to new characters again, during Ken's travels. Ryuga is one of them, who has his own star separate from the North star and 6 South stars. Then we are introduced to a 3rd type of star(s): the 5 Nanto Chariot Stars, and the masters of each of those stars: Hyui (wind), Shuren (flame), Fudo (mountains), Juza (clouds), and Rihaku (ocean).

In this series you really start to learn what Raoh is all about, and how he became what he is, and his rise to power. In this series, Raoh and Kenshiro finally have it out, once and for all.

I don't want to say too much, but if you loved the first 2 volumes, then this is a must have, as it ties all the series together.

We also find out what became of Julia. The finale episodes really are just awesome to watch, as is this entire volume, as well as the first 2 volumes.",1523577600,2,1218,4.1923076923076925
