6780826,4,B00P11J4LY,"Love this series, but have had problems with the discs.  Ordered another one before this one and only watched disc 3 to get caught up before the season 3 premier. Wish it had been released in time to watch the entire set. It kept freezing up and returning to the warning screen.  I returned it and revc'd this one as a replacement.  Again, only watched disc 3 which also kept skipping.  It was annoying, but watchable. I hate paying for defective merchandise.  Still haven't watched the other discs.  If they skip too I will return the whole set.  My husband and I watch several dvds each week and have not had trouble with any others.  Amazon, where did you get these?????????????",1439856000,2,681,4.570247933884297
6780827,5,B00P11J4LY,Graceland is new show that I recommend to watch from season one to now on season three. It is about undercover work from all branches of law enforcement . My favorite character is FBI officer Mike Warren. Hope you check it out.,1439769600,,227,4.428571428571429

6780839,4,B00P11J4LY,"I really enjoy this show. This was a interestingly dark season in comparison to the first one.

I was expecting there to be deleted scenes and bloopers like the first season set, but nope only the 13 episodes.",1435536000,,209,4.5
6780840,4,B00P11J4LY,great show,1435104000,,10,4.5
6780841,2,B00P11J4LY,"After years of success with their light, Blue Sky summer programming, the USA Network decided to get a little darker with Graceland.  I went along for the ride, and sadly, I found the first season to be rather lackluster.  But I was gamed to give season 2 a shot.  Unfortunately, I found it worse than the first season.

The season oepns with Mike (Aaron Tveit) working a new position with the FBI in Washington, DC.  Things appear to be going well until he gets word from Briggs (Daniel Sunjata) back at Graceland that the Caza drug cartel has put a hit out on Mike.  This brings Mike back once to hopefully shut down the cartel once and for all.  Hes now leading a plan involving all of his former housemates.  If only that were their sole focus.  Piage (Serinda Swan) becomes obsessed with helping a woman she meets while under cover.  Dale Jakes (Brandon Jay McLaren) is hoping to win visitation rights with his son.  Charlie (Vanessa Ferlito) gets involved with a dangerous bank heist.  And Johnny (Manny Montana) gets caught up in a love triangle.  Meanwhile, Briggs is trying to overcome his guilt and keep evidence about what he did last season secret.  Will any of them be able to focus on the Caza cartel?

So what went wrong?  Pretty much everything.  Lets start with the characters.  In the first season, I liked them all at some point, and I could often sympathize with them even if I didn't like them.  This season?  They all turned unlikeable.  Even those I could like and support for part of the season turned bad by the end.  And, at times, their actions were unbelievable.

The story also went downhill.  They had several equal plot lines going, so I could finally remember who all the players in the cast were.  And yet, the divided focus just kept me from getting fully into any story.  And its not like things came back together.  Instead, we are trying to keep track of several equal plots that carry different weights in each episode.

Ironically enough, I probably could have handled the darker themes of the story itself.  While the things the agents face and have to do aren't my first choice of fictional consumption, I know they exists, and if I liked the characters, I would have been more on board.

The actors always did a great job of bringing their characters to life.  Its the writing that let them down.

Having said all this, there were a couple episodes early on and moments even late in the season that I definitely got into.  But just when I would begin to think it had turned a corner, it would show that it was just a temporary moment and I would be disappointed again.  Unfortunately, that disappointment kept building as the season progressed so there was less and less stuff to enjoy.

And yet, I do plan to watch at least the season three premier.  I am curious enough about the characters and the cliffhangers to see how things are resolved.  But unless there is a major reversal in the course of the show by the end of that episode, Im out.

The ratings for season 1 weren't the best, and they slid for season 2.  Thats why we are getting all thirteen episodes in this MOD set.  As such, there are no extras, just the episodes themselves to watch.

The slide in the ratings shows that Im not the only one who was disappointed with the way the show went.  Hopefully, things turn around in the new season or season two of Graceland will be my last.",1435017600,,3393,4.486088379705401
