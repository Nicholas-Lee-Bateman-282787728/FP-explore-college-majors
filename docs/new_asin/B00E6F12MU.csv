5893491,3,B00E6F12MU,"3 films from Asylum studios, they went stright to video...

Both Rise of the Zombies and Zombie Apoclypse are directed Nick Lyon he also did Dead Island among others.

they are mostly digtal zombie effects ect but for 7 bucks  these movies which are always poping up on SyFy channel are here in set and uncut, and come on they are not that bad but i gota say seeing  Lincoln chop off heads  is my favorite of the set...",1481155200,,419,4.253164556962025
5893492,3,B00E6F12MU,"I bought this as a triple feature and watched ""Rise of"" last night but they didn't really explain what caused the zombie outbreak and it was just weird that they showed Danny Trejo as a zombie (bet he had a good time doing that short role.)",1480204800,,240,4.239130434782608
5893493,4,B00E6F12MU,"A couple of the 'better' zombie films. I'm a fan of the zombie genre and 2 of these are of the, above average films of the genre, at least to me. Never saw the Abe Lincoln film, but have seen the others several times on Chiller. If you're a fan of the 'zombie' genre,I think you will enjoy this pack. Whichever of the films you have seen or not.  I'll eventually hit the Abe Lincoln one. Of course it's the price that made me buy,just alone the price is great for 1 of the films.

5893494,3,B00E6F12MU,"Great quality holster for a S&W K-frame. Problem is, I ordered for a J-frame, & a police positive. For that purpose, the holsters are too large to be useful.",1445644800,,157,4.448275862068965

5893496,1,B00E6F12MU,"Not very good. Honky acting. Dumb stories. Lincoln's Gettysburg address
added to script was really out there. To much cutting off heads and blowing
holes in the Zombies. Don't waste your money on this one.",1400803200,,205,4.885714285714286
5893497,4,B00E6F12MU,Movies are okay. I saw them on television and thought that they were good enough to buy.  The description states 3 discs but it is actually 3 movies on a single disc.,1383436800,4,166,4.1875
8602079,4,B00E6F12MU,"A three-movie zombie set for one low price?  Go for it!  I'm a freak for zombie movies.  Bottom line - if you're looking to kick back and kill a little time with a choice beverage, you will enjoy this set.  As a fan of Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames, I liked the first two movies better, but I must admit that seeing Lincoln chop zombie heads with a cut-down, retractable scythe was pretty cool.  There is even a little twist at the end of that one to tie it into historical facts.  If you don't set your expectations too high and go in with the thought of enjoying some post-apocalyptic struggles as well as how zombies may have played a role around the Civil War era - you will have a good time with these!",1530921600,,705,4.185185185185185
8602080,2,B00E6F12MU,The only decent movie is the abraham movie.. The other 2 have no story.  At all.. And the graphics are terrible. You can even see the mannequins they used.. Its awful,1516665600,,166,4.354838709677419

8602086,4,B00E6F12MU,"We all need a bad film to watch and laugh at because of a very crappy day we had, so here are three of them for you to laugh at. I must confess this, though: I found ABRAHAM LINCOLN VS. ZOMBIES a lot more fun than the big-budget ABRAHAM LINCOLN VS. VAMPIRES. So, if you want to laugh at the unintentionally bad antics of zombies, I recommend this set.",1488499200,,351,4.101449275362318
