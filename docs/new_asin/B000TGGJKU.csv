2899230,5,B000TGGJKU,"I recieved my copy of Troy and watched it last night. This version takes an already good movie and turns it into a great movie. I applaud Warner Bros for bring out their Blue Ray renditions in the originally intended directors cut. They have done this with other movies such as The Patriot, and what a difference it makes, almost like watching a whole different movie. I understand why the studios trim a movie down to allow more viewings within time constraints. The motive is ofcourse to make money which is why they're in business. But it sad when a Blue Ray DVD is actually a better movie than the theatrical release. These directors cuts ae how the director intended his movie to be seen. Troy was so much better
in Blue Ray, when you see it you'll be happy you bought it. Then you have to decide who to give your old version DVD to.",1190851200,2,838,4.378205128205129
2899231,1,B000TGGJKU,"My girlfriend and I eagerly awaited this release on Blu-ray, since she liked the movie originally, but UGGH--this is so disappointing. For starters, the look on high def is not much different than the DVD release, not enough to be noted anyways. The original theatrical cut of the film was OK, but this directors' cut is so campy--the additions of flowery, CHEESY dialogue did this already poorly rated film NO favors. If you have Netflix and want to support Blu-Ray and encourage Warner Bros. to get off their fence, then add it to your Queue. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS ON BLU-RAY!!",1190505600,,592,4.757281553398058
2899232,4,B000TGGJKU,"I'll make this quick...

Picture is awesome in HD
Audio is awesome.

so the a/v experience is everything you should expect from a good Blu-Ray title. Not the best disc ever, but never a let down for HD.

The movie is really fantastic. The extra 30 minutes turned this movie from a fun wanna-be epic into a a movie I REALLY like. I liken the transition from Two Towers to Two Towers extended edition. Now, this isn't as good as Two Towers, but the level of improvement is about the same. If you even mildly liked the original TROY, buy this much improved version. You will not regret it.",1190419200,4,586,4.3577981651376145
2899233,5,B000TGGJKU,"The blu-ray version of this new Director's Cut has an incredible picture and great sound.  Disregard the review talking about pan&scan.  Amazaon lists a 166:1 Aspect Ratio and 2 discs.  This is incorrect.  Blu-ray only needs 1 disc and the Aspect Ratio is 2.4:1.  This Director's cut is far superior to the original theater version.  In addition to adding 30 minutes of footage, they've added new, additional music.  And, WB, has reworked the image (even the standard DVD)to enrich the colors.  This new version is well worth having, even if you bought the orginal DVD, or saw the movie in the theater.",1190419200,2,602,4.833333333333333
2899234,3,B000TGGJKU,"Please ignore the previous two reviews of this disc.  R. Guentner made a valid point based on the aspect ratio of 1.66:1 listed for the disc.  Thankfully, this is a mistake made by the people at Amazon.  The Blu-ray disc, like the DVD and HD-DVD versions, is actually presented in the correct aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  Embarrassingly, Jesse Vela completely missed the point.  If the Blu-ray release had actually been chopped down to 1.66:1 from the correct aspect ratio, this would have been an insult to the film, but it turns out just to be a typo.",1190332800,,549,4.618556701030927
2899235,5,B000TGGJKU,"As to the person who gave it 1 star obviously hasn't seen this version.  It is in widescreen and it looks great.  The movie is fleshed out so much better.  It was almost as if I was watching a whole new movie.  It is much more graphic and sexier than the original version.  The violence of the Troy
beach scene is in my opinion much more graphic than 300.  The score to the movie stands out more, not too heavy but enough to notice it.  I owned the score and yet when I saw it at the theater and my dvd collection it was barely noticable.  I would recommend this to anybody who loves period pieces  .  This one is for the fans!",1190332800,,627,4.024390243902439
2899236,5,B000TGGJKU,"The Director's cut of TROY is superb. 30 addtional minutes and a revised music score makes this movie a must buy on BLU-RAY. Yes, Troy is in widescreen, and the HD picture and sound quality are outstanding.",1190160000,7,206,4.594594594594595
2899237,1,B000TGGJKU,"I have not seen this movie but I checked the specs. The turkeys that made the Blu-Ray version must think that we will buy anything on Blu-Ray. This, and several other, Blu-Ray movies are nothing but ""PAN AND SCAN""! The same lousy trick that was used to put widescreen movies on a narrow TV screen. I would buy the widescreen DVD before I would waste the big bucks for this ""PAN AND SCAN"" Blu-Ray version! One Star for NOT being the Widescreen version!",1190160000,2,451,4.445783132530121
2899238,5,B000TGGJKU,"Nice Blu-ray disc here, excellent lossless audio, vc-1 encode hovering along quite nicely in the mid 20 mbps's in the busiest action scenes with very little picture noise at all.
Warner are doing a great job with their video encodes and it's good to see them supporting lossless audio more frequently.
I ordered this through Warner's own website and it arrived last night as is often the case.

2899243,2,B000TGGJKU,"I was sorely disappointed in this film.  I could not wait to see this movie in the theaters.  But then the film started, and I realized it really had very little to do with the story of Troy (the Iliad and the Odyssey).  Characters that lived through the twenty year war, died in the film.  The film shows Menelaus dying, and yet he actually took Helen back to Greece with him.  It is weird watching a film taken from Homer's classic so changed.  Where were the God's...who played such a vital role in the Iliad.  Why were people who died kept alive in the film and others that should have lived, killed in the film.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Very, very, very disappointing from a fan of Homer's point of view.",1491264000,,718,4.338345864661654

2899246,5,B000TGGJKU,"If you've already seen ""Troy"" then I needn't tell you that this is an excellent film in every sense of the term. If you've not had the pleasure of viewing ""Troy"" then this Director's Cut is the best place to start. The restored scenes cut from the theatrical release add more dimension and scope to the characters and a more visceral aspect to the stunning battle sequences. As is the case with all big budget productions ""Troy"" employs an army of talented artists and craftsmen behind the cameras and an extremely talented ensemble of actors bring the story to life. Wolfgang Petersen's direction captures both the epic scope of the story and the subtleties of the characters with equal skill. The battle scenes while bloody are never exploitative and the love scenes are rendered with a softness that contrasts the combat beautifully.  What sets ""Troy"" apart from most other ""blockbuster"" movies is that it's themes and characters are universally understood. You could take ""Troy"" and set it in WW2 and other than the setting the interpersonal conflicts would remain just as recognizable. Even if you can't relate to Agamemnon's overarching greed and ambition(superbly portrayed by veteran actor Brian Cox) you've seen enough people like him in the news to at least understand what drives such men.  Brad Pitt portrays Achilles as a brooding but deadly warrior searching for immortality through memory of his deeds while Eric Bana's Hector is torn between his personal convictions and his patriotic duty to his country. Both men are superb in their respective roles.  The Director's Cut of ""Troy"" is well worth your time and money. You'll get a visual feast in service to an excellent story bought to life by superb acting that imbues the characters with very recognizable traits. What more can you ask for?",1487548800,3,1809,4.983443708609271

2899252,4,B000TGGJKU,"The combat scenes were outstanding. Swords were flashing, and spears were being tossed. Fighting was up close and personal as combatants hacked each other.
.
The details in the Blu-ray version were outstanding. These were evident in various scenes.
.
CLOSEUPS ON THE KING AGAMEMNON: The viewer could see the individual hairs on his head and beard with their varied shades and tones. Brown spots, hair stubs, lines, and pores on his aged face were noticeable.
.
COSTUMES: The Bronze Age armor was intricate with their geometric designs. The encrusted colored gems produced different shadow tones and sparkled in the sun.
.
CLOSEUPS ON THE COMBATANTS: The sweat on the soldiers' faces glistened and rolled down their pores, leaving wet trails on their faces. The sweat also bunched strands of hair together, while the dust settled and caked them.
.
My only complaints were the inaccuracies of the film. The producers took artistic interpretations to extreme. There were many things that contradicted Homer's ILIAD.
.
1. Hector did not kill Menelaus in combat. In the ILIAD, he and Helen sailed to Egypt and to Sparta after the Trojan War.
.
2. Paris and Helen did not escape together after the sack of Troy. In the ILIAD, Paris was wounded by a poison arrow and died.
.
3. Hector did not kill Ajax in combat. In the ILIAD, Ajax was not awarded Achilles' armor after his death. He vowed vengeance and plotted to kill the Greek leaders during the night. The gods cursed him with madness, and he slaughtered a herd of sheep instead. Coming to his senses, he was ashamed and committed suicide.
.
4. King Agamemnon did not die during the sacking of Troy. He lived and sailed home. His wife knifed him on his homecoming. This was in revenge for the sacrificial killing of their daughter to appease the gods and bring favorable winds during the voyage across the Aegean Sea.",1470528000,,1865,4.777089783281734

2899264,5,B000TGGJKU,"A nice glimpse back in time to the age of Mycenean heroes. Apparently substantial research was done for this film. Brad Pitt's acting style is often flat. The guy who plays Odysseus is better. The woman who plays Helen believably fits the role of the most beautiful woman in the world. Agamemnon looks like a warrior. Peter O'Toole, ol' frozen face, does a good job as Hector's father. Overall I enjoyed this.",1453075200,,409,4.694444444444445

2899274,5,B000TGGJKU,"The 'DIRECTOR'S' cut, has 30 minutes of additional footage to enjoy in this extravagant spectacle in which the
battle sequences are among the best ever screened, the director's cut that little more graphic than the theatrical
version.
It tells the legendary tale of 'Paris's (Orlando Bloom) passion for 'Helen' (Diane Kruger) wife of 'Greek King' of
'Sparta' 'Menelaus' (Brendan Gleeson) risking all to take her from 'Sparta' back to 'Troy'
'Menelaus' shamed by this act turns to his power seeking brother 'Agamemnon' (Brian Cox) for help and to join
him in a war against the walls of 'Troy'
'Helen' is accepted by 'Priam' (Peter O'Toole) father of 'Paris' and 'Hector' (Eric Bana) as an adopted princess of
Troy.
'Agamemnon' needs the legend-seeking 'Achilles' (Brad Pitt) a warrior looked upon as a hero and inspiration by his
soldiers, he asks 'Odysseus' (Sean Bean) to persuade the man who fights for glory and not for King or Country.
The fleet of 'Agamemnon' numbers 1000 ships carrying 50,000 battle hardened warriors, they hugely outnumber the
Trogan-Army led by 'Hector'
The soldiers of Troy have the advantage of the high walls, while 'Hector' leads them they are a formidable opposition
for the Greek Hordes.
The film an epic of modern day cinema filmed with the benefits of the high-tech effects available to this 2004 movie.
The additional 30 minutes added by this version considerably enhances the viewing pleasure.
Homer's -Troy Illiad - Stuff of Myth and Legend was seen as an extravagant and mythical story until a 19th century
explorer/archaeologist found the site.....
Many great performances afforded by the cast of the film, though in truth, 'Brad Pitt' does steal the limelight from the
outset.
Truly a superb spectacle, well worth a re-visit or indeed a first viewing.......picture and sound quality superb throughout.

2899305,4,B000TGGJKU,"Troy is the epic historical drama based on the famous Iliad by Homer that recounts the events of the Trojan War. It all starts with the love affair that happens between Paris (Orlando Bloom) a prince of Troy and Helen (Diane Kruger) who is married to King Menelaus of Sparta, while he and his brother Hector are in Sparta to negotiate a peace treaty. Not exactly the best way to look for peace is it? LOL Anyway Paris is young and naive and if you asked me downright stupid! But he decides that he is completely in love with Helen and he even takes it so far as to hide her away secretly on their ship when they depart back home for Troy unbeknownst to everyone including his brother Hector. When Hector finds out he is furious and tells he men to turn the ship back around to Sparta that they are taking her back, as he knows that it will only cause more strife if not out right war with Sparta. Paris professes that he can't live without Helen, and that if she must go back that he will go with her - even if it is risking his own life to do so. Hector is torn but he loves his little brother and reluctantly gives in and they proceed to Troy.

When Menelaus finds out of his wife's treachery and of her flight to Troy with young Paris he is livid and goes immediately to seek the help and counsel of his powerful brother Agamemnon (played by Brian Cox - who by the way it seems can never play anyone accept an absolute cold-hearted jerk in every movie that he is in sheesh). This is just the kind of situation that Agamemnon has been waiting for as it gives him an excuse to attack Troy which he has been wanting to defeat and add to his growing empire for a long time. But he isn't doing it for his brother he is only interested in more power and prestige for himself and he is more than willing to do whatever it takes to get it.

And so the legendary tale of the face that launched a thousand ships (Helen's - which although she is all right looking I am sorry no one is that beautiful to warrent all that fuss...especially not her LOL) begins the war that will see the legendary clashes of warriors who's names still ring out through the ages like Achillies, Odysseus, and Hector.

I won't go into all the details you will have to watch the movie to see all the epic battles and Brad Pitt and Eric Bana looking cut and sexier than they ever have and I'm sure ever will in this one!

I will however mention that the love story between Achillies (Brad Pitt) and Briseis (Rose Byrne) is beautiful and haunting at the same time. LOVED these two characters together! Their part alone is well worth watching the movie for by itself.

Now the film is now available in both the theatrical version and an Unrated Director's Edition. I have seen both and I own the Director's version. What's the difference between the two? Well you get 34 more minutes of the film that was never seen before that includes more battle sequences, the main characters are more flushed out in several places, and there is more footage at the ending that to me lent the story a much better and more hopeful ending than the theatrical version showed.

So it is more than worth it to spring for the Director's cut over the regular version for this one. Not to mention you also get several behind the scenes special features that weren't available before with the previous releases of the film.",1409184000,,3367,4.319620253164557

2899344,1,B000TGGJKU,"Let me preface this review by saying that I sincerely enjoyed the original version of Troy. As a fan of ancient history and all things mythical, I purchased the Director's Cut on top of my copy of the original. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointing in the quality of the adaption. To start with, the music throughout the film has been drastically mixed around and in almost every case I found it to be horribly mismatched. The original employed the score to evoke the proper emotions at the proper moments, but the Director's Cut succeeded in botching this up big time and erasing much of the original's verve. Now, for example, there's uplifting music after Hector's death and also as the Trojan Horse is brought into the city. I literally found myself saying: ""What?""

To top it all, this film is - in my opinion - a classic example of ""more is not better."" The many scenes with small snippets of extra dialogue added in consistently underwhelm. The original dialogue is significantly crisper and more meaningful. In the end, the added content only subtracts from the quality and beauty of the story. (Side Note: Having a dog licking dead people's faces does not even count as extra content. If you've seen it, you know what I mean.)

I watched this version once and never plan to waste more of my life by watching it again. And that's because the Director's Cut is an altogether poorly contrived film. In short, it's a joke. Take my advice and stick with the original.

2899346,3,B000TGGJKU,"My review is in no way taking into consideration the Iliad; it is strictly my conclusion based on the Director's Cut versus the Theatrical release.

Hollywood does what it wants, viewers want to be entertained. Hollywood doesn't think in a purist manner, but in a profit manner. The question is whether we as consumers feel satisfied with the results of Hollywood's modifications.

I have seen the theatrical release several times and liked it; I would give that between 4 and 5 stars rating. The Director's Cut I found to be much more uninvolving. From the beginning of the film with a dog running around scavenging and sniffing various corpses to added childish spats between key characters the added material mostly added viewing time, not significant enhancements to the story. There were also edits to the musical score, which I especially disliked during the battle of hector vs achilles. I specifically switched to the theatrical release DVD to compare the sound on that battle because I emotionally felt bored on the Director's Cut which has never happened before. The intensity to that battle came back viewing the theatrical release.

There were some scenes in which added discussions maybe gave a little more insight into conclusions that were made in the story, such as: the debate how Troy would handle the pending war (in which Paris said he would fight Menalaos), how the man carving a horse inspired the idea of the Trojan horse, the debate about bringing the Trojan horse to Troy, etc. These were however mainly insignificant; the theatrical release provided enough for viewers to be able to fill in the blanks.

For the overall story, musical score and scripting, the theatrical release is much preferred.",1331337600,,1723,5.013986013986014

2899349,4,B000TGGJKU,"I loved the theatrical cut of Troy, and was hugely excited to find an expanded director's cut that promised more depth, character development ... and fighting! I enjoyed it hugely, though I have to say some of my expectations were disappointed: I read many reviews that said this longer version of Troy was really ""a whole different film,"" and I expected a drastic rewrite and expansion of the plot and characters--rather like Ridley Scott did with the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven.

This is not that: it has a few longer scenes, which add some development to characters and situations, and it definitely gets an extra edge and impact from the extended battle scenes (which are great, but, be warned, quite gory--not ""Spartacus"" level, but there's guts on the sand). Most of the extensions work well, and do add more depth and tension--but, in the end, I feel it's the same film as the theatrical cut, just longer and bloodier. Brad Pitt's Achilles is still a complete psychopath, Orlando Bloom's Paris is still pretty much a lovesick twit, and Eric Bana's Hector is noble to the point of silliness ... Brian Cox's Agamemnon is even more villainous and scenery-chewing in this version (if that's possible) there's more Peter O'Toole, which is fantastic by any measure, and Diane Kruger's Helen even gets a bit more development (and an extended nude scene).

It all worked well for me: I thoroughly enjoyed the original, and this gave me a lot more of the stuff I liked the first time around. Don't expect it to drastically change the movie for you.",1323388800,2,1555,4.798507462686567

2899356,4,B000TGGJKU,"Blu-Ray review.  If you are reading this for the DVD copy, this information may not be accurate.

Film:  4/5, Image Quality:  5/5, Audio Quality:  4.5/5, Extras:  3/5, Overall:  4/5

Quality:
This Blu-Ray is like a gift from the gods.  The picture quality is supremely colorful, vibrant, clean, and has excellent sharpness and detail.  Sound quality is uncompressed, and it is really clear and clean, but I did have to turn the volume up quite a bit more than usual; it seems rather subdued.  Some parts also seemed a bit muffled; possibly due to source issues from reinserted footage.

This Blu-Ray disc presents the extended Director's Cut, which is nearly 200 minutes long and contains a lot of interesting new footage that's perfectly interwoven in the movie itself.  The disc also contains a number of featurettes and a trailer.

Film:
Personally, I am not familiar with the original story for the battle of Troy, so I can't comment on how historically/mythically/culturally accurate this movie really is.  Whether it's fully embellished or not, it is a rather fun and timeless story; it is only appropriate that Hollywood should someday film it with such a high production cost and a full list of A-list actors.

This is such a film; a slick and stylish production with plenty of large-scale set-pieces, exotic-looking locations, huge battles and fight scenes, ambitious CGI effects, and a smidgeon of classic romance.  The talents of Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, and even Peter O'Toole are all dispensed here.  Watching ""Troy"" is about as rewarding of an experience as the long list of other Hollywood epics (such as ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" or ""300""), for better or for worse.

The best part about this film is that it is tremendously entertaining.  Whether watching the original two-hour theatrical cut or the rather sublime three-hour director's cut, the film is tightly paced and hardly ever dull.  Battle scenes are spectacular and often times bloody.  Individual fight scenes are pretty swell too.  The CGI work is a little fake-looking, but still well-realized and quite slick to look at.  Outside of the battles, the film is quite pretty to look at, with so many unique settings and solid camera work.

The most negative aspects about this film would likely be reserved for the pickiest of viewers.  Despite the film's quality production, it is not even comparable to the most highly-rated epics in this genre; movies like ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart"" can easily out-match ""Troy."" After all, ""Troy"" does not have the same quality writing and acting, much less the same thematic prowess or emotional power.  It is certainly not as immersive, deep, or insightful.

In the end, ""Troy"" is a polished and entertaining film.  It comes recommended to most casual audiences, but those looking for full artistic valor can do better.

The original ""Troy"" was impressive and fun to watch. With the Director's Cut, Wolfgang Petersen has given us an epic, a ""Spartacus.""

Again proving as he did with ""Das Boot,"" Petersen shows he knows exactly what he wants to present on the screen, and how to make the screenwriter's script into a towering film. I purchased this copy because it was an Amazon ""Prime"" with a lowered price and free shipping for a Blu-Ray to replace my bought-at-the-video-store-pre/viewed DVD, but I am staggered with the intensity the added dialog and footage brings, the flow and movement of the film makes it seem shorter than the theatrical version, not longer. The soundtrack is now perfected, and that loser singing ""Remember Me"" is where it belongs: in the trash.

This is not art, history or literature, but in my not so humble opinion, it is the high water mark of the ancient epic. I doubt they can top it, and it adds on more reason to let the theatrical release be the true Director's Cut.",1281052800,4,1133,4.717171717171717
2899360,3,B000TGGJKU,"If you're reading this review, you probably already know what Troy is all about. If not, a brief sum up is that this film is a modern retelling of Homer's classic epic poem, The Illiad, which to most people, needs no introduction. Of course, this is a very stylized, action-oriented take on the story, leaving out much of the original works's depth. This review is for the Extended, uncut, edition Blu Ray disc release which I just bought and viewed. First off, the film's high definition transfer is excellent, the film is visually stunning, especially on newer LED LCD HDTV's in 1080p resolution. This version's extended scenes, unfortunately, were not very good, and did not add anything special to the film's original theatrical release. Of course, this is my opinion, as others may find the extra dialogue better in some way, although I did not. Of course, one of the more noticeable extended scenes was the inclusion of Diane Kruger's nude scene. Most of the scenes, you realize, were cut out in the editing room for a reason, because they slow the pace of the film considerably. Troy is no exception. However, as a fan of this film, its directors and its well casted actors, I give this film and its Director's Cut BR disc version 3 out 5 stars, mainly because of the stunning fight sequences.",1279929600,4,1300,4.7312775330396475

2899366,4,B000TGGJKU,"This is a very strange character omission from this movie,  In Greek mythology, Cassandra also known as Alexandra was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy. Her beauty caused Apollo to grant her the gift of prophecy. However, when she did not return his love, Apollo placed a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions.

In an alternative version, she spent a night at Apollo's temple, at which time the temple snakes licked her ears clean so that she was able to hear the future. This is a recurring theme in Greek mythology, though sometimes it brings an ability to understand the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future.

Apollo loved Cassandra, and when she did not return his love, he cursed her so that her gift would become a source of endless pain and frustration. In some versions of the myth, this is symbolized by the god spitting into her mouth; in other Greek versions, this act was sufficient to remove the gift so recently given by Apollo, but Cassandra's case varies. From the play Agamemnon, it appears that she made a promise to Apollo to become his consort, but broke it, thus incurring his wrath: though she retained the power of foresight, no one would believe her predictions. Telephus, the son of Heracles, loved Cassandra but she scorned him and instead helped him seduce her sister Laodice.

While Cassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy (she warned the Trojans about the Trojan Horse, the death of Agamemnon, and her own demise), she was unable to do anything to forestall these tragedies since they did not believe her.

Coroebus and Othronus came to the aid of Troy out of love for Cassandra. Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother Hector being brought back to the city.

At the fall of Troy, she sought shelter in the temple of Athena, where she was violently abducted and raped by Ajax the Lesser. Cassandra was then taken as a concubine by King Agamemnon of Mycenae. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.

I know to fit this story in with Troy would have been impossible but nonetheless, this woman should have been involved in this movie! It's Hectors sister for goodness sake!

Now just as Achilles has his heel, We have ""The Cassandra Effect"" now the Cassandra effect is when a person believes he or she knows the future happening of a catastrophic event, having already seen it in some way, or even experienced it first hand; however, the person knows there is nothing that can be done to stop the event from happening and that nobody will believe it even if he or she tries to tell others. For example, in finance, the more you warn your colleagues about the tail risks--the rare but devastating events that can bring the bank down--the more they roll their eyes, give a yawn and change the subject. This eventually leads to self-censorship.",1251331200,,3127,4.735294117647059
2899367,5,B000TGGJKU,"There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version.  The BD version is the best version released for audio and video.  The video is a quantum leap above the DVD version as the richness of the detail in sets, clothing, and actors are eye popping.  The audio is a quantum leap in clarity and staging, and complements the imagery to roar scenes into one's living room with hubris and magnificence.  The wider color gamut and superb digital transfer makes many scenes appear real and even super real.  Alas, the movie itself suffers a bit in 2 respects. Music is weaker and less striking, as a different score is used, and some scenes are filled with synthesizer scores that are clearly out of step with any of the music.  Filler music is added and borrowed from other movies, and mentioned in the end credits such as taken from Planet of the Apes.  While the movie benefits from the extended scenes added to complete the story, some scenes drag, and the pacing is no longer as fast as the original.",1250208000,4,1052,4.476439790575916

2899369,4,B000TGGJKU,"Like ""Alexander"", ""Troy"" benefits greatly from a director's cut. This reworked version is more complex and rewarding, although it still feels a bit shallow, unlike ""Alexander"", which is a much more honest film.

The straightened-up relationship between Achilles and Patroclus (they were lovers, not cousins, in Homer's original), rings false and robs the film of a true emotional center. Brad Pitt certainly looks the part of the hero, and we see pretty much all of him in this version of the film. Yet by not staying true to the source material, Achilles' feelings toward Patroclus can't be truly expressed, so in other ways we really don't see Achilles at all.

Eric Bana nearly steals the show out from under Pitt, while Orlando Bloom is relegated to a sort of pretty boy support player. Peter O'Toole is grand and solemn as the Trojan king, adding weight and gravitas to an otherwise messy and sullen story.

Yes, is is better than the theatrical version, and is another reference-quality Blu-Ray transfer, but overall ""Troy"" feels like a missed opportunity to really dazzle modern audiences with what is, after all, the original epic story.",1244678400,,1145,5.015789473684211
2899370,4,B000TGGJKU,"Lawrance Bernabo's review of Troy mirrors many of my own views and disappointments in this cinematic adaptation of the classic story between the nation states of Greece and Troy. And though it's not unusual for aspects of the story to change to accommodate another medium, why do it if it's not necessary? That was one of my main objections to the film.

Another is when characters depart from an otherwise reasonable course of behavior. Priam, sending his two sons to Sparta to negotiate a long-sought peace treaty, shows absolutely no anger or even annoyance when his sons return with the wife of the Spartan king! Wouldn't one expect Priam to lose his temper at the gross irresponsibility of Paris in wrecking the said alliance and bringing a potentially ruinous war and siege of the city? Instead, he immediately greets Helen with all the warmth of a future in-law without being in the least perturbed. This goes beyond mere license and puts the viewer in a completely unnecessary situation of suspending disbelief. So why did it happen? I understand the script writer needing to transition to acceptance, but the transition was too quick, too unbelievable and too contrived.

There also is no way to justify the treachery of Paris' action. As Priam was too quick to accept it, so, too was Hector. Both situation demand indignation. This isn't the first time Paris had behaved in this manner, and this time it meant war and the loss of Troy's fair sons. Yet it's handled in much the same manner as if the purloined object was a water bottle, not a man's wife. Whatever nobility Priam and Hector may of had was lost by their reckless disregard of the situation. Hector's spontaneous slaying of Menelaus also was a blight upon his nobility. By the time Achilles comes to seek vengeance, one has had enough of both Hector and Paris. I only regret that Achilles didn't slay Paris at the same time.

I have no problems with the computerized battles, but people never respond as they should. Before Hector is slain, Priam could have ordered the archers to unleash their volley on Achilles, but Hector stopped him with no explanation. Was he being noble? Ha! Any nobility was long gone by his previous behavior. And after Hector's death, he could have ordered the archers to keep him from dragging Hector's body away, but again, the writers hope you won't notice. Wouldn't it have been better to have them unleash their arrows and have them fail to hit the Greek hero, volley after volley? That would have appealed to me far more, plus it would have hinted divine intervention, which was too much lacking in this production.

Still, even with its lamentable faults, the movie is still well worth owning and watching. It's just a shame that the opportunities were missed. Hollywood should know better, but its contempt for reality is too often obvious in its productions.

Director's Cut: The added scenes really round out the Director's Cut. Achilles battle on the beach, the small but well rounded character insights--they all are improvements. In the Theatrical Cut, Achilles makes a brief impression, but almost immediately leaves the fight. The extended scenes give us a better glimpse of why he was the greatest of the Greeks and why Agamemnon was the most arrogant.

Of particular merit was Sean Bean's outstanding portrayal of Odysseus. He is worthy of a sequel as the Ithacan king who stayed away too long from his wife and kingdom.

Some don't approve of the deeschatologizing of the story, but I've never much cared for the way the gods stole glory from the heroes. And there's the line by Achilles to Briseis that he knew more than the priests about the gods, because he had seen them. That's all the mention they deserved.",1242518400,3,3731,4.8203125
2899371,4,B000TGGJKU,"In the very capable hands of director Wolfgang Petersen, TROY is a full-blooded realization of a tale once consigned to the realms of myth. The battle scenes--generally the hardest thing to stage---are some of the best in recent memory. The sequences that feature champions of each army in one-on-one confrontations are vivid and real.  I also enjoyed the way that screenwriter David Benioff cleverly mined the source material for plausible ways to explain many of the story's legendary elements--for instance, Achilles'heel.

Eric Bana, Brian Cox, Peter O'Toole, Sean Bean, Brendon Gleeson, Saffron Burrows and Rose Byrne all give each of their respective characters a vibrant on-screen presence. Brad Pitt works well as the preening, self-centered Achilles but a couple of his scenes would have served the film by being left in the editor's bin, especially when his acting calls attention to itself, reminding us we're watching a Movie Star and not an historical character.

Most importantly for Blu-ray fans, this version of the disc is well worth the price. Director Petersen's cut is arguably better than the theatrical version and some of the film's sequences appear to have been framed more effectively.

Though somewhat predictable since the history is well-known to even moderately educated folks, despite the half-hearted love story for the gals, this is a very good retelling of the story.  Like 300 should have been (but was too cartoonized), it humanizes a classic.  Very good acting, great graphics, and mostly on-original.  I grew up with the classics, learning as Icarus did, the lessons of life from those who lived thousands of years ago, who in turn had learned them the hard way.  And the classic adventure is not lost here.  It ain't poifect, but it's as close as I've seen Hollywood come.  I recommend it, much as when I read Classics Illustrated to review the thrilling book I'd read earlier, and remember its wonder with less effort.  Very good entertainment.  I put it ahead of Alexander the Great (Burton version which was poorly cut but stirring, especially Newman's music) and The 300 Spartans (Egan version, too Hollywood, but decent to the great story, still better than the hokey 300), one of my all-time favorites, and in BluRay....wow!

2899376,5,B000TGGJKU,"This movie was already on my top 20 list. But after getting the Directors Cut on Blue Ray I have bumped it up to top 10.

The Movie:
Having the extra scenes is awesome. I have not ben this excited about deleted scenes since LOTR. The new scenes just tie everything together. Right out of the gate the movie starts out with the camera following a dog. I thought what the hell is this? But it comes together. The battle scenes, although very much more graphic, give the viewer a better feel and scope of the battles. The love scenes have been extended, some with more nudity. But if you can take the blood then you can take the boobs. The deleted scenes also add depth to the characters. Telling a little more to each of their stories. There is much more but you get the gist.

The Blue Ray:
This movie was made for BR! I noticed things I never did on my DVD player and 31"" tv. Viewing with a PS3 and 46"" Toshiba LCD (1080) you see scars on people faces you didn't see before, you see the deep blue of the sea, you see every single drop of red blood. And the blue clothing that just about everybody wears is just breathtaking. And is it me or do all the Trojan have blue eyes??

2899382,4,B000TGGJKU,"I'm really going to forgive some massive fundamental flaws and applaud this fun epic popcorn flick.  Obviously, and it is assumed that like many cinephiles, I have a major problem with Troy's very existence to the core.  Consider for a minute that the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B000W8OM5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alexander/dp/B0009PLLN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alexander</a>&nbsp;are called ""historical fiction"" but they are based on people we know existed.  Troy is based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Iliad/dp/0140275363/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Iliad </a>&nbsp;but it works in such a way that the audience is possibly being urged to believe these were real events.  So the film in essence is based on the possible events that took place during the Trojan War.  In fact, it doesn't even stay particularly true to The Iliad but it does try to capture the icons associated with the Trojan War and at the very least it keeps in tone with The Iliad, especially with regards to the violence in its battle sequences and the portrayal of Achilles' wrath.  However, no gods or mythical figures to speak of and that is, at the very least an indirect attempt to steer the audience from believing that this is fiction.  Maybe it is just because so many other epic films released are based on some degree of truth.  Troy is based on myths and that's alright if you want to portray it that way.  2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Arthur/dp/B000MQ58WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Arthur</a>&nbsp;had the same problem but with less CGI.  Troy has a lot of CGI and it cost $180 million to make.  They didn't need to stretch so far for believability but like I said, some movies are just worth forgiving.  This is eye candy; it is Hollywood to the bone.

Nevertheless, I liked Troy and it looks incredible on blu-ray.  The director's cut includes extra battle cuts, extra nudity, and it even has some scenes that assist in character development.  The extra footage is actually seamless and makes the movie far longer but also far better and if there is an epic film made for superior visual technology like blu-ray, Troy is just that film.  There is no pretending here, Troy is a true Hollywood production and I actually mean that with at least some degree of affection.  The cast is great and includes of course Brad Pitt as the seemingly invincible and infinitely angry Achilles, Brian Cox as one of the film's real villains in Agamemnon, Eric Bana plays the heroic Trojan warrior Hector, Sean Bean plays Odysseus, Peter O'Toole plays Priam with fitting melodrama, Tyler Mane plays the chaotic and violent Ajax, and the very beautiful Diane Kruger plays Helen; the face that launched a thousand ships, or was it her breasts?  All are good in their roles but no one seems to take themselves too seriously and for the most part their performances, or in some cases just their presence, work within the film.

The battle scenes in Troy are huge and absolutely second to none. There are tons of battle scenes within this 196 minute Director's cut and they just keep on going while getting more and more exciting and out of control.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/soundtrack/dp/B000244F7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">soundtrack</a>&nbsp;for Troy is clearly an upgrade from the theatrical version and makes the battle scenes seem even larger as it booms and powers in and out of great sky shots over the beginnings, middles, and ends of various battles.  The cinematography and visual effects, whether the fake kind or the real kind, look absolutely amazing on blu-ray and the great shots never cease in Troy.  The music is huge, the drama is huge, and the visuals are even bigger.  It is visually one of the most impressive blu-rays so far and that is because it is a visually driven film to begin with.  Troy truly is epic in every sense of the word.  Well, except for that whole idea of it being based on an epic poem.",1202342400,8,4242,5.53953488372093

2899387,5,B000TGGJKU,"First off, I must say that Amazon.com is *the* hands down best site for ordering just about any product off the web.  The prices are usually the lowest with the bidding/comparison system, and shipping is very fast and reasonable (with options).  I have gone through a process where the product was defective (not as advertised), and Amazon simply refunded my money and said to keep the item.  Yes, that is service!

Anyhow, enough about what we already know.

Blu-Ray -- If you are buying this movie, you have a player.. So odds are you know it is the latest and greatest in High Definition at the current Main Stream moment.  (It and HD DVD,.. but I digress).

So on to the Movie:

This is how I see things from these reviews..

For those of you considering the Movie.

A) It looks amazing, -- Take out the plot/acting, etc.. And just focusing on the Quality of the High Definition product,.. It is not just a 'Pan and Scan' like some might say, .. It is a Next Gen, high quality, great Mastering product.  You will absolutely not be disappointed in the 'visual and audio' return from this disc.

B) Ok, you are sold on quality, and have the player, and trust Amazon enough to purchase. --- Now you are asking yourself, is this movie one I will enjoy?

No one can answer that for you, of course.  Though, consider this,.. It is a trivial price for starters.  It is a popular movie, that if you don't like, someone very close to you likely will in a worst case scenario.

In comparison,.. If you like most of Brad Pitt's acting/work you will like this movie.

If you enjoy movies such as Gladiator, Braveheart, or other action/epic tales.. You will enjoy this.

Orlando Bloom plays his role well, but his role matches his true 'Real Life' physical character.  In other words he isn't the big 'kick your butt' kind of role in this film.  He still plays an important part, and is a worthy adversary.

If you are a 'stickler' on COMPLETE authenticity historically,.. You might find some things 'off' -- But, I could re-butt that argument with ; How much do we really know FACTUALLY about the empires existing at that time?  So the movie is 'easily' believable if you take into context of 'legendary' figures such as 'Achilles',.. and 'Hector' et al.

If you ever watched the HBO series, ""Rome"", and enjoyed it.. You will like this DVD.

If you are 'into' a bit of fantasy and interested in Ancient Romanesque Culture and Epic Triumphs with accompanied Defeats.. You should enjoy the flick.

I can only say positives,.. It isn't my 'favorite' movie of *all* time,.. But it is, to me, a movie that you can watch once.. Really enjoy,.. and some months later easily watch it again.  (Some movies you simply cannot fathom watching again, if that makes sense).

Again, it looks and sounds amazing.  So if you have a great Home Theater,.. You will make good use of it via the Disc.  It is cheap, relatively, so what is the harm?

I suppose if you absolutely abhor Brad Pitt's work, you probably won't enjoy this.  If you cannot stand fact and fiction mixtures,.. you might be annoyed.  If your mind simply cannot delve into a little bit of a fantasy world,.. You might not be able to get 'into' the movie.  (I can't really come up with a major 'Con' list without going into details of the plot.. Which I do not think is necessary or useful on Amazon.com.)

Enjoy the movie!  Hope this helps , .. a little. =)",1197936000,,3398,4.505728314238953

But watching this new version at home it feels a little more rounded. There is no addition of plot or major sequences it's just little sprinkles here and there. Characters seem to have a little more breathing room. The taking of Troy is definitely a little more graphic which I feel grounds the film a bit more than it's theatrical release. Overall it's a film that is quite satisfying as an epic tale and an action film. The fight scenes were well designed and a little different then the other sword films out there.

2899390,3,B000TGGJKU,"The movie was great in the theater and on blu-ray.  The only fault that I could really find was that the musical score was changed for the worse.  Some of the scenes actually lost a bit of character due to the change of music.  Other than that, decent movie to own on blu ray if you don't already have the dvd.",1195516800,,310,4.049180327868853
2899391,5,B000TGGJKU,"Review of the Movie:

If you enjoy movies where one character is so unmatched in skill and determination that he (or she) truly is the best in the world (or even of all time), then Troy the Director's Cut is for you.  The movie does a great job of conveying this one element.  And I would go as far as to say it is perhaps one of the best at it.  To emphasize the ""unbeatable warrior"" motif, the extended cut has beefed up the fight choreography.  So much so, that I would give the fight scenes a 9.4 out of 10 (those are ""300"" marks).

Review of the Video:

Every detail...every detail--from the threads holding together Achilles' (Brad Pitt) rob in his first scene with his cousin Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) to the multi colored shields of the Greek hoard advancing on Troy to the carvings in King Priam's (Peter O'Toole) throne-- every detail is clearly visible.  This is quite frankly the most detailed Blu-ray I have reviewed yet (I own close to 50 disc, counting HDDVD and box sets as well).

There is no color filter or film cast over this movie like Alexander revisited.  Some believe that it gives the movie a ""Television"" look and takes away from theatrical effect.  This movie, however, is too grand to have that happen.  In fact, the absence of a filter puts you (the audience) in the action.  I felt as though I could walk on the sandy earth of troy or wipe the sweat from Hector's (Eric Bana) brow.
This movie is an excuse to purchase a high def player and television.  I give the Director's Cut 8.8 out of 10.  As opposed to a 6.7 out of 10 for the Original Cut.",1195257600,2,1578,4.374570446735395
2899392,5,B000TGGJKU,"This format is awesome!!  Take it from someone who currently own""s over 860 DVDs.  Now of course only 40 of them are Blu-ray, but I like to think it gives me a very nice point of view.  Anyway in this format the picture is much crisper!  The fighting scene come to life!  You can hear every sword clashing and see much more gory during the beach scene.  If your a action junkie like myself, in this format you almost want to be there with a sword and shield.  The director cut gives more in site to the small stuff.  Lets you know why the GODS were reference so much.  I love this movie in the original format...........but with the director cut BLU-RAY I'm in love!!",1194048000,,667,4.272
2899393,5,B000TGGJKU,"Another terrific remastered Blu-ray, superb picture, very little image flutter in the action scenes, brilliant sound.  For the blooper lovers: the ""dead"" horse in the first few minutes moves its ear and the eyes blink as well, and see if you can spot the overhead jet's vapour trail in the sky in one scene with Brad Pitt!",1193961600,,322,4.649122807017544
2899394,5,B000TGGJKU,1080p video is excellent! The fight sceens have be re edited to be more graphic.  If you liked the dvd version you will love this version.,1192838400,,138,4.3076923076923075
2899395,5,B000TGGJKU,"I really like this directors cut and the quality of the Blu-Ray high defintion and sound. This version is much better than the regular one. I especially like period movies and thought this was a good one. I also have the 1956, Helen of Troy, which is a good CinemaScope picture for it's time considering the stereo sound.",1192579200,,321,4.551724137931035

2899397,5,B000TGGJKU,"Alright so last week we were watching this movie at school since we were covering the Greeks and we watched the theater cut in school and i decided to head on to amazon and buy it for myself only to find out that they only had a directors cut in high-def so i bought it , and i watched it and oh my god  the directors cut is  so much better , it adds parts to the movie that should have been there before so if you own a blu-ray player please buy this movie , it looks great and adds a whole lot to the original TROY. Oh the only thing i didn't like was that its 196 minutes long A.K.A you'll be sitting there for 3 hours but its all worth it because this movie is great.",1192233600,,671,3.820143884892086
2899398,5,B000TGGJKU,"I thoroughly enjoyed Troy from theater to DVD and have seen it numerous times.  But when the Director's Cut came out, it just made sense to purchase it.  I was not disappointed.  Although the movie is long, with a few of the original scenes deleted and numerous additional scenes added, the Director's Cut simply makes more sense.  The characters are more real, and the story line more interesting.  Above all, the Blu Ray picture is fabulous with sharpness, crispness, and detail simply missing from the original DVD release.  For me, this is a must-have DVD, and it clearly shows why the high definition DVD formats shine.",1191715200,4,624,4.839622641509434
