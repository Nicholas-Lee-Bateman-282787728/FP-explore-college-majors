8416561,5,B000MC7KJ0,"I love this video. It has 2 Peanuts Specials, both of which are centered on Valentine's Day. The first special, entitled IT'S YOUR FIRST KISS, CHARLIE BROWN, really made me happy when Charlie Brown faced his title fortune with the red-haired girl, despite an awful/humiliating football game outcome due to Lucy's taunting (I would smack her if I could). The other special, SOMEDAY YOU'LL FIND HER, CHARLIE BROWN, depicts a rather depressing outcome for Charlie Brown when he falls in love with a girl who makes a cameo on TV during a football game: Linus steals her from him. I know I probably shouldn't like a TV special that's this depressing, but it never gets too old for me and I still like it anyway because it helped me get over a really sad breakup I had to deal with when I was in 6th grade, and made me feel less ""Alone"" (coincidentally, the song of this title is sung in the background by Becky Reardon near the end). GREAT video for Valentine's Day or someone who is getting over a breakup!!!",1298851200,,1004,4.521978021978022
