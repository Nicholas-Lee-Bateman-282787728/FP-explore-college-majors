8459887,5,B0056UBH7Y,This is my favorite work from Ballet Magnificat. This was when the ministry was in its early stages & there was such an anointing on the choreography & dancers. We love it! I only wish it were also available in DVD.,1453161600,,215,4.2682926829268295
8459888,2,B0056UBH7Y,"The ballet part is ok. But I was lead to believe that the music by artists Steve Green, Sandi Patty, and Steve Fry was going to be performed live. However, that is not the case as it is simply the studio recording of these artists singing. They are not even present and are most certainly not singing live. If you like ballet you might love this, but DO NOT purchase this to see live music. You will be grossly disappointed.",1414627200,,424,4.3125
