3070408,5,B0011WMIH4,"""Romulus, My Father"" is simply the best movie I've seen in a long time. It's an autobiographical tale by Raimond Gaita, an esteemed philosopher in Australia (but you don't need to know the background to appreciate the tale and the amazing acting). This coming-of-age story illustrates the life of a Romanian immigrant family in Australia. The plot is fairly simple, but the characters are gripping.",1215820800,,398,5.138461538461539
3070409,4,B0011WMIH4,"Without going into the plot- most other posts cover it here, I wanted to share my thoughts on this movie as well. It is a sad but very insightful view into a child's experiences as he watches his parents relationship develope into something so depressing and unhopeful. Despite that, I still loved this story because of the performances by the actors. This memoire reminds me of another memoire turned movie ""This Boy's Life."" The story is depressing the whole way through, but because of the actors/actresses, it becomes more realistic and gives you a reason to care what happens to these people.

Also, i forget the name of the person responsible for the cinematography on this movie, but it is outstanding! I wanted to keep each frame and each shot as a photograph and frame it on my wall, it is that good. The colors and the whole look of the picture, just takes you back to that particular time and place. It gives the sad movie a sense of peace and comfort where you would least expect to find it. I looked it up on IMDB, and seems like he also did the cinematography for Little Women, another movie with an excellent look/feel. Sometimes I would buy a movie to keep just for that reason - its like keeping a photograph book that takes you somewhere else everytime.

This is a very touching movie - It'll have you thinking about it long after the movie is over. And to learn that it was a true story and what has become of that child in the story, gives you assurance that it does have a good ending after all.

Its missing 1 star from perfection beccuase as much as I liked this movie, i don't know how many times i could watch it - even though i plan on buying this movie.",1214956800,10,1680,4.378205128205129
3070410,5,B0011WMIH4,"After watching this film, I had to ponder for some time about what I had just seen. The tale of Romulus is quite complicated, not only in the things that happen to him directly, but also the bizarre circumstances that he is put in, at the same time. Christina, Romulus' wife, behaves in such an erratic and bizarre way that I would have to concentrate on her character much more so (in order to figure her out) than any of the other film's characters. Rai, the son of these two people, watch bleakly as his family life falls apart before his eyes. Franka Potente and Eric Bana are two of my favorite actors. They have revealed once again, their unique ability to capture a role so passionately and realistically.
Just to warn you, this is not a ""Fun Friday Night Movie."" It is based on a memoir and the childhood described in it, is one you would never wish upon a child in the past, present, or the future. In fact, I would have to say that this memoir was one of the harshest and most brutal depictions of growing up that I have seen in a long time.",1211587200,,1051,4.28643216080402

In the autobiographical coming-of-age tale, ""Romulus, My Father,"" Eric Bana, of ""Munich"" fame, plays an impoverished German migr struggling to raise his son, Raimond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in rural 1960's Australia.  The major obstacle to the family's stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men.  Despite her highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him.  It is, unfortunately, the good-hearted and good-natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie (Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author).

Even though I admire ""Romulus, My Father"" for what it is trying to do, I can't honestly say I enjoyed it, for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it,  these simply aren't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing, which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen.  A serious slice-of-life drama is one thing, but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery, insanity and multiple suicides (let alone attempted suicides) is something else again.",1209859200,3,1341,5.267605633802817
3070412,4,B0011WMIH4,"Raimond Gaita is not a name widely known to the world outside Australia where he serves as a professor of philosophy, writing extensively on 'skepticism (moral, of other minds and of the external world), on the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of psychology, on aspects of political philosophy (collective responsibility, the role of moral considerations in politics, genocide and the alleged uniqueness of the Holocaust), on education (the nature of teaching as a vocation, the role of love in learning and the plight of the universities) and on Wittgenstein's philosophy of mind and language'.  After this filmed version of his memoir ROMULUS, MY FATHER, he may well gain a larger audience.  This low budget film uses fewer words than silences and actions to depict the childhood of Gaita in the period around 1960. For many it may seem an aimless, prolonged, sad film, but for others it will deliver a life force in a sensitive child that is indomitable.

Romulus Gaita (Eric Bana)  immigrated to Australia from Yugoslavia with his wife  Christina (Franka Potente) and their son Raimond (Kodi Smit-McPhee).  Romulus works as a blacksmith and farmer to support his family: Christina is not happy with the confinement of marriage and motherhood and finds frequent reasons to have promiscuous jaunts away from her small house and maternal duties. Romulus and Raimond are very close and find ways to exist without Christina, especially when Christina has an extended affair with a family friend Mitru (Russell Dykstra) and has a child by him.  Despite warm support from Raimond and  his best friend Hora (Marton Csokas), Romulus decompensates and his radical behavior results in his hospitalization in a mental institution.  How Raimond's bond with his beloved father endures despite the endless tragedies that befall his 'home' provides the closure of this tender memoir.

Nick Drake provides the screenplay from Gaita's book, Richard Roxburgh directs, Basil Hogios provides the sparse musical score for Geoffrey Simpson's magnificent cinematography of the desolate plains of Australia. But it is the solid performances by Eric Bana and  Kodi Smit-McPhee as father and son that make this film so memorable. Grady Harp, April 08",1209254400,24,2232,5.241573033707865
3070413,5,B0011WMIH4,"In writing this review, I struggle to digest the film, to wipe my tears and construct a cohesive sentence...

Romulus my Father is a deeply moving story, tracing the path of one family as they struggle to survive as Australian immigrants, a mothers neglect and abandonment, and very great love.

Is the love between mother and son, father and son, husband and wife? It's all kind of hard to say, as in most families.

The heartwarming performance of Raimond as portrayed by our little Aussie actor, and Eric Bana's superbly executed Romulus is never sentimental, always harshly real but compassionately drawn.

I highly recommend this beautiful film, although it is a tearfest and if you have children you'll come away cherishing them all the more.

One explicit scene & moderate coarse language. Not suitable for kids.

3070415,5,B0011WMIH4,"""Romulus, My Father"" is an Australian drama genre film that reflects on the adolescent stages of philosopher Raimond Gaita's life.

Set during the 1950s in rural central Victoria the Gaita family are European migrants of German and Romanian decent. Country Victoria is challenging for them with limited employment opportunities and isolation. To make matters worse Raimond's mother Christine (Franka Potente) is unfaithful to his father, yet Romulus still cares for her immensely despite her frequent entering and departing from his and Raimond's life.

Eric Bana confirms his capacity as an authentic drama actor with a strong screen presence that is a sincere and passionate representation of Romulus.

Kodi Smit-McPhee is superb as Raimond Gaita and he conveys Raimond with sweet innocence, and unwavering love for his mother and father. His performance as Raimond also portrays a boy who is forced to grow up quickly as his parents experience their own hardships and tragedies.

The cinematography splendidly captures the beauty and ruggedness of rural Victoria.

This film shines tremendous hope with a narrative that reveals a hard life that ultimately leads to a life of great academic attainment.

3070419,4,B0011WMIH4,"""Romulus, My Father"" is being touted as an ode to father-son relationships. As portrayed by this film, however, it plays more as a tribute to childhood resilience. The father suffers through incredible loss, but his son seems more profoundly affected by the damaged adults around him. Franka Potente and Eric Bana provide solid performances, but the true star is Kodi McPhee, who has to wrestle with a wide array of emotion. He succeeds completely. There wasn't one false note in his portrayal of the son of a mentally-disturbed mother and an aloof, brooding father. Kodi shows more emotion in one scene than Bana and Potente do in the entire movie.
  Bana plays a man who shares a few tender moments with his son on an isolated Australian ranch, but for the most part he remains distant and detached. He rarely smiles, his face carved with worry. His wife returns from hospitalization in a psychiatric institution but doesn't seem improved. She shows affection periodically, but is never consistent in her actions, and spends most of her screen time smoking and staring into space despondently. The movie never explains why she is so disaffected, but it has obviously taken its toll on Bana, who tries to be a good father and husband, but is slowly tortured by her impulsiveness and self-absorbed immaturity. When she has a baby, she ignores its wailing and would rather sit in a trance-like state than feed it. In many ways, the boy is the parent. He survives a marathon of tragedies that would crush most children's psyches.
  Among the horrors visited upon this boy are: watching a man exterminating chickens with a shovel because they are diseased, being pummeled by his father because he lied, watching his mother get savagely beaten by a man who can no longer stand her uncaring behavior, having to stay with his mother and try to keep her awake after she overdoses on pills, and almost getting an axe buried in his skull when his father dissociates in a furious rampage and doesn't recognize him. Many moments are brutally honest. One favorite is when the boy gets angry at his father for infidelity and blasts music in the shed, trying to use frantic dancing to show defiance. Later he will try to surface feelings of joy with the music, but finds he cannot. Another moment is when his mother comes to visit and he rebukes her in a restaurant. The boy has grown weary of her childishness and tells a professor at school that he does not want contact with her anymore.
  The film does not gloss over the emotional scars inflicted on the boy. A scene at the end involving a rifle shows that he is teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The movie begins and ends with a simple ritual that provides a flicker of hope for the future. That the boy survives and succeeds in life is a testament to the strength of a child who hasn't reached adulthood yet and is willing to believe that anything can get better with time.",1261180800,,2928,4.675728155339806

3070421,5,B0011WMIH4,"I like movies like this because it shows that no matter how rough or disadvantaged a child's upbringing may be, he or she can overcome it to become a success or even just a reliable citizen.  There could hardly be a more mixed up life than that had by little Raimond.  This is the story of what he went through growing up with two - or should I say three or four - mixed-up parents.

There are lots of sexual situations, beatings, and bad language so this movie isn't for children.  A responsible non-parent might show it to a teenager who is in the same situation as Raimond and then point out how he was able to overcome his upbringing; but, they should be prepared to mentor the teen as well.",1233187200,,695,4.282442748091603
3070422,5,B0011WMIH4,"Yesterday, we watched the DVD of Romulus, My Father, which follows Raimond Gaita's memoir of his early life with his father scrupulously. On the way back to Dubai in 2003, I had come across philosopher Gaita's The Philosopher's Dog. I bought it, read it and passed it on to our philosopher son Jeremy (The Ecological Life) to read. Shortly after, Jeremy picked up Gaita's Romulus, My Father, and returned the favor by passing it on to me to read.  I found it exceptionally well written and deeply moving.

Let me start by saying that the movie of Romulus, My Father is exquisitely filmed. It's all light and shadows,  sepia browns and yellows in the back country of Australia, the movie analogue of those great photographs of the Depression by Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. The acting, too, is first rate. Eric Bana (Munich) is a perfect choice for the father, conveying emotion even when still and displaying the essential gravity and weight of Gaita's working class father plays the father. ALL the actors are first rate. The story tells of young Rai's growing up caught between a strong, almost Old Testament father and an emotionally and mentally troubled mother who drifts in and out of the family wreaking havoc wherever she lands. Another virtue of the film is the dramatic use of stillness, which gives the viewer time to let his or her feelings grow of their own accord. The movie won several awards in Australia but received almost no critical notice in this country.  That's a shame because it's really good.",1220832000,11,1522,4.797709923664122
3070423,3,B0011WMIH4,"""Romulus, My Father"", wow, catchy title right, with Eric Bana (Munich, Troy) and Franka Potente (Run, Lola Run), plus a true story, it must be good!

No, its not! The performances by all actors/actresses were good, the story was boring, very boring.

Later he will try to surface feelings of joy with the music, but finds he cannot. Another moment is when his mother comes to visit and he rebukes her in a restaurant. The boy has grown weary of her childishness and tells a professor at school that he does not want contact with her anymore.
  The film does not gloss over the emotional scars inflicted on the boy. A scene at the end involving a rifle shows that he is teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The movie begins and ends with a simple ritual that provides a flicker of hope for the future. That the boy survives and succeeds in life is a testament to the strength of a child who hasn't reached adulthood yet and is willing to believe that anything can get better with time.",1261180800,,2928,4.675728155339806

3304918,5,B0011WMIH4,"I like movies like this because it shows that no matter how rough or disadvantaged a child's upbringing may be, he or she can overcome it to become a success or even just a reliable citizen.  There could hardly be a more mixed up life than that had by little Raimond.  This is the story of what he went through growing up with two - or should I say three or four - mixed-up parents.

There are lots of sexual situations, beatings, and bad language so this movie isn't for children.  A responsible non-parent might show it to a teenager who is in the same situation as Raimond and then point out how he was able to overcome his upbringing; but, they should be prepared to mentor the teen as well.",1233187200,,695,4.282442748091603
3304919,5,B0011WMIH4,"Yesterday, we watched the DVD of Romulus, My Father, which follows Raimond Gaita's memoir of his early life with his father scrupulously. On the way back to Dubai in 2003, I had come across philosopher Gaita's The Philosopher's Dog. I bought it, read it and passed it on to our philosopher son Jeremy (The Ecological Life) to read. Shortly after, Jeremy picked up Gaita's Romulus, My Father, and returned the favor by passing it on to me to read.  I found it exceptionally well written and deeply moving.

Let me start by saying that the movie of Romulus, My Father is exquisitely filmed. It's all light and shadows,  sepia browns and yellows in the back country of Australia, the movie analogue of those great photographs of the Depression by Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. The acting, too, is first rate. Eric Bana (Munich) is a perfect choice for the father, conveying emotion even when still and displaying the essential gravity and weight of Gaita's working class father plays the father. ALL the actors are first rate. The story tells of young Rai's growing up caught between a strong, almost Old Testament father and an emotionally and mentally troubled mother who drifts in and out of the family wreaking havoc wherever she lands. Another virtue of the film is the dramatic use of stillness, which gives the viewer time to let his or her feelings grow of their own accord. The movie won several awards in Australia but received almost no critical notice in this country.  That's a shame because it's really good.",1220832000,11,1522,4.797709923664122
3304920,3,B0011WMIH4,"""Romulus, My Father"", wow, catchy title right, with Eric Bana (Munich, Troy) and Franka Potente (Run, Lola Run), plus a true story, it must be good!

No, its not! The performances by all actors/actresses were good, the story was boring, very boring.

The opening scene is the father (Eric Bana) heating up hibernating bees, until they take flight, as it turns out, that is also the final scene of the movie.

Trust me, its boring, don't say I didn't warn you...........",1217116800,,469,4.765432098765432

8242814,5,B0011WMIH4,"Marvellous portrayal of Rai Gaita's affectionate memoir. The dry countryside is ever-present, virtually a character informing the narrative. Bana as Romulus is superb as are all the cast, particularly the affectionate  watery-eyed Rai. The film had me weeping in the last third as one catastrophe slides into another.  How Gaita psychologically survives and flourishes is acknowledged in two sentences screened at the film's end. In the brilliant book that provided the basis for Nick Drake's script, Gaita speaks of watching the epic ring battle between the heavily favoured Sonny Liston and Mohummed Ali. He identifies with  Ali's absorption of pain, the hammering of Liston's terrifying power, by hanging in on the ropes taunting the champ and eventually landing him a knockout blow.",1491955200,,786,5.426229508196721

8242819,4,B0011WMIH4,"Eric Bana as Romulus gives a remarkable performance as a Central European immigrant to Australia trying to raise his son, Raimond, on a farm outside Frogmore, Victoria, Australia, while his wife, Raimond's mother, appears and disappears from their lives.

At nine years old, the precocious Raimond insists on remaining a boy despite the demands from the adults around him that he take up the roles they are unwilling or unable to fill.

Romulus' best friend Hora (Marton Csokas) is inspirational in his support of his best friend and his best friend's son.  In some ways Hora is an even more solid role model for Raimond than Romulus though both Romulus and Hora are hard-working, honorable men.

Raimond's almost perpetual playfulness, determination, and ability to live in his own happy moment despite what is going on around him carries the story and the film through otherwise soul-breaking tragedies.

Unfortunately this DVD did not include English subtitles.  Subtitles would have been very helpful when dialogue was almost inaudible and/or difficult to understand given the Central European, German, and Australian accents.",1375574400,,1130,5.320224719101123

8242822,4,B0011WMIH4,"This is a well-made movie.  The acting, directing, cinematography, sets, and scripting are all up to professional standards.

The story is depressing as all hell, however.  In some ways this is just another movie about a dysfunctional family, a movie genre that is getting so shopworn it ought to be retired permanently.  But in other ways, the movie rises to the level of literary fiction.  At times one is reminded of William Faulkner's work.  More often, though, one is reminded of Jerzy Kosinski's fairly sickening book ""The Painted Bird.""

The scene is rural Australia circa 1960.  The story is about a little boy and his father trying to cope with a wayward mother and wife who is sliding into insanity.  Her craziness is primarily expressed by her out-of-control sexuality.  Both father and son try everything in their power to help the woman extricate herself from the troubled life she has created, but in doing so, they come very close to wrecking their own lives.

Not a happy story.  Worse, it is apparently based on a true story.  And although the movie title seems to imply that the story is about a father and son relationship, which it is, it is also about the love of a little boy for his mother and the love of a husband for his wife.",1348444800,,1252,4.636363636363637
