6131741,5,B00H4FQBW0,"City On A Hill produces the best study material available (in my humble opinion). ""AHA"" follows step with their previous studies, ""H2O"", ""Not A Fan"", ""The Easter Experience"", ""The Christmas Experience"", and ""Gods At War"" and continues the awesome quality of their material.

This study does an awesome job of paralleling modern-day events, real-life situations, with that of the story of the prodigal son. The truths wrapped up in this story are presented very well and the message of the heart of the study is conveyed clearly (just like all of their studies). :-)",1400889600,7,565,5.01063829787234

6131744,5,B00H4FQBW0,"This is a hard-hitting extremely relatable video series! I enjoyed watching this with my loved ones as we meditated on what it means to be in the ""Distant Country"" mentioned in Luke chapter 15, and the steps necessary to travel back into God's will and good gifts.",1426291200,,264,4.638297872340425
6131745,5,B00H4FQBW0,"I love the way Kyle weaves the prodigal son story through 3 individual lives. Brings the story into modern times. If you are looking for a small group study this is it. Also try Kyle's ""Not A Fan"" video series as well. Money well spent.",1418515200,,236,4.266666666666667

6131748,5,B00H4FQBW0,A great study that has people still referring to things that Kyle Idleman says.  I used the study for a prison ministry and when the guys talk about having an AHA moment I remind them that they need to have all 3 areas to actually make a move to better their lives. They wanted to know the end of all the stories but I told them that isn't what happens in real life and it was a great discussion. As in all of Kyle Idleman's series that quality of the study is amazing. We also used the study as a small group study in our church and it was received very well.,1410739200,3,560,4.0
6131749,5,B00H4FQBW0,"K Idleman's studies are always spiritually motivating and AHA is no exception.  It brings you
face to face with where you are or where you might be headed that is not by the Holy Spirit. Much scripture woven thru the book and the journal.",1409270400,5,238,4.409090909090909
6131750,5,B00H4FQBW0,All of Kyle Idleman's video studies are great.  We are small group leaders and our groups love the studies.,1406073600,,107,4.631578947368421
6131751,5,B00H4FQBW0,"While each and every one of Idleman's Bible studies is completely different, they all have several things in common.  They teach from the Word, using modern day examples that seekers can connect with.  They have good production values.  These aren't hokey Christian movies with tortured dialogue and even worse acting.  The acting is excellent and helps to make the points that Kyle is trying to make.  I'd show any of his studies sight unseen, but I enjoy them so much that I do prepare for the studies that I lead by viewing the videos and reading the excellent study materials that come with each set.  Highly recommended.",1402185600,9,625,4.794392523364486

8629839,2,B00H4FQBW0,"As a group, we've only reached the second episode. With this in mind, I cannot yet review the overall message or impact of the study, but what I can offer is a serious question as to the discretion of Idleman and the filming/production crew. The second episode opens with one of the main characters premiering at a strip club in her pursuit of the ""distant country."" While the camera does not capture any nudity or much of the actress's torso, it offers a lot to the imagination with an extended, several minute scene laying out what is going on. You can hear the men whooping and yelling, ""Yeah, babe!"" and the camera shows her twisting around the pole and her removed negligee falling down her legs. Later in the episode you very briefly catch the back of a very scantily dressed dancer in the background.

Now, while I know that there is much worse than this on tv and that the scene is describing a reality in our world, I don't think a Sunday School or Bible Study group should need to filter through what could very easily lead viewers to stumble while participating in a study that is supposed to lead us to greater sanctification. Offering a semi-realistic example of what a strip club is like does little/nothing to improve the perception that this young lady is making a poor choice and needs to come back from the ""distant country."" Many viewers have likely already seen what a strip club is like (either through film or firsthand experience), and do not need to be reminded or tempted to return to those memories. Furthermore, those who have not do not need to be ""educated"" during Bible study.

I was very pleased with Idelman's ""Not a Fan"" study and went through it twice. His teaching style and method are engaging and bring a necessary challenge to the reader/viewer. This time around, I am disappointed. Once again, I cannot remark on the overall effect of the study, but this scene alone is enough to keep me from recommending this study (at least the video portion) to anyone. I am very disappointed.",1445212800,10,2019,4.621169916434541
