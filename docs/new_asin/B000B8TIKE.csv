2408916,4,B000B8TIKE,This movie is based on the real life friendship between America's most famous serial killer and America's famous true crime writer. The movie states that this is her first book and that she did not know it was her coworker that was the serial killer that police were looking for. The story is told mostly from her side of the story and if you are expecting blood and guts then you will be disappointed. But if you are expecting a story that will have you thinking twice about the people you know then you have a winner here. Great acting and storytelling also will help keep you at the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this to all true crime fans!,1196553600,,652,4.352459016393443
2408917,3,B000B8TIKE,"I got this movie knowing it probably wasn't that good. It was a decent movie, but I am someone fascinated by the screwed up Bundy mind. In that regard, it was not too bad.
However, i am also a stickler for accuracy when films are based on true stories - and they changed a lot of facts in this one!
Not enough to bug someone just in for entertainment, but for someone into history, sociology, or psychology, it is annoying!
Names are changed, no real problem with that since it is to respect victims, but other important things really aren't mentioned, and the relationship between Ann Rule and Bundy is really blown out of proportion.
I mean, it was kinda self-serving. Thing that annoyed me was Chi Omega killings: Bundy used a club of oak and left splinters everywhere. In this movie, he uses a flashlight. What is the point of this change? Soften the blow? (pun intended)

Good points of the movie: does provide insight into the killings (to those who haven't read the book anyway)
Ann Rule repeats her belief that Ted Bundy killed Ann Marie Burr (you will know who that is if you know Bundy lore, if not, i do not want to spoil it for you)

Altogther, interested in bundy and/or the deviant mind, watch it, if not, pick something else more lighthearted. it is not really that suspenseful or violent and it is too long for something to sit down and watch for fun - unless you are interested in it like i am.",1190851200,2,1411,4.423076923076923
2408918,1,B000B8TIKE,"Having worked on Death row with Ted, speaking with him in great detail and reading almost every book about him, this version of his story is the worst I have seen in terms of accuracy. It's like they not only did not try to present the facts of the Bundy case accurately, they seemed to have tried (and succeeded) to present the story as fictitiously as possible. Some of the court scenes were sort of accurate, but not many.  For something with Ann Rule's name on it, this is a total let-down.",1190073600,34,494,4.369565217391305
2408919,3,B000B8TIKE,"While it didn't turn into a poor version of the Bundy tale, it never comes alive with any feeling. The Mark Harmon version of the story made in the 80's was far better and didn't feel the need to change so many of the facts around.

2408921,3,B000B8TIKE,"For the price ($5.50), I found it to be a good picture. Upon viewing it initially I was disappointed but after thinking about it for a while, I realized that this movie should be done in a shallow way. That's because thats what Ted Bundy really was, just like Scott Peterson and others who murder strangers and family alike. All his ""good"" talents were really morphed over time. Too bad he was born to be handsome later, but accompanied by different influences that turned out to be deadly probably starting in 1962.",1164931200,3,516,4.619565217391305
2408922,2,B000B8TIKE,"I bought this DVD after reading Ann Rule's fascinating book of the same name.  A longtime fan of both Billy Campbell and Barbara Hershey, I was anxious to see their portrayal of Rule's riveting (and true) story about her longtime friendship with Ted Bundy.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

Everyone knows that made-for-TV movies often lack the quality acting and scripting of feature films, and this one was no exception.  Although I know Hershey and Campbell to be fine actors, I think the poor quality of the script dragged them down in this instance.  The most riveting feature of Rule's book was her emotional dilemma in trying to reconcile the Ted Bundy she knew as a witty, giving friend with the gruesome serial killer he became.  Rule's struggle about what she feels for Bundy -- if she should stand by him or turn her back on him -- just doesn't come across in this movie, nor does the lingering affection she feels for the man even AFTER she accepts what he's done.  Perhaps it's because so much of the development of the Rule/Bundy friendship is either changed or left out entirely.  In my opinion, the weak script just didn't provide enough opportunity for Campbell and Hershey to generate any kind of chemistry at all.

More often than not, Hershey portrays Rule as someone who is often annoyed with Ted and simply tolerates him even BEFORE she learns what he's done.  I never really buy them as good friends at all.  I did not get the same impression from Rule's book in which she seems to feel rushes of emotion for Ted, and often wants to protect him as a big sister might.  Certainly Rule detested Ted's acts and felt betrayed by him, but right up until the end, she felt true emotion for the friend she once knew.  I don't get any of that from Hershey's version.  Campbell's performance as Bundy is ok -- even decent at certain times -  but again, a weak script limits him.

Factually, this movie is riddled with glaring mistakes that will really annoy someone familiar with Bundy's murder sprees.  The changing of victims' names is totally justified, but things like the circumstances of Bundy's final arrest, his two escapes from jail, the way he flees from the Chi Omega crime scene, and even the color of his VW are unecessarily rewritten -- and not even in a way that improves the drama.  Bundy's famous kidnapping and murder of two girls from Lake Sammamish State Park in 1974 is left out altogether.

Perhaps this patched together TV movie was even more disappointing because the source material was so rich -- and so wasted.  I don't know if Ann Rule wrote the teleplay, but if she did, that's even more of a crime.  The emotion between important ""characters"" -- all based on real people --  just falls flat.

I have not seen the Mark Harmon TV-movie on Bundy (The Deliberate Stranger), but from what I can gather, you'd be better off obtaining and watching this one rather than the Campbell/Hershey version.",1155945600,49,2938,4.673151750972763

There was however, some vital information about Ted Bundy's life that was revealed in Ann Rice's movie.

2408930,2,B000B8TIKE,"This is a terrible movie. It way overemphasizes her role in the events, the acting is mediocre, and the movie just hobbles along like wounded animal, with little historical accuracy. Ann Rule was never a cop and did little to assist the police except as a volunteer helping to comb the woods to find bodies. The worst part is that it is supposed to be taking place in the mid 70's and instead looks more like the late 90's. Deliberate Stranger, even though it was a TV movie, was far better. This movie sucks and Ann Rule is a ghoul who profits from true crimes and deserves to be punched in the face for having anything to do with it.",1377820800,,635,4.3

2408934,2,B000B8TIKE,"I didn't read the book, so I can't compare the two. I have to admit this film seemed a bit disjointed at times, and didn't really show much of a pattern with Bundy. It came across more like stories sewn together. Sometimes that is okay, but I think it took away from this movie. Maybe even random comes to mind. It didn't really reveal how sick Ted Bundy was, and it was hard to feel much emotion with the storyline being so choppy. Dealing with a depraved individual I wasn't expecting to see details of his murderous spree, I expected to see those eyes which leave no doubt about this man. Even looking into this case on the internet, you see those ruthless eyes that reveal his true character. This film failed to show the many facets which a serial killer can have. While the ""other"" film on Ted Bundy made me very angry at Mark Harmon, this one just left me scratching my head.",1358812800,,882,4.351515151515152
2408935,1,B000B8TIKE,Just watched the movie. Characters were fine but the plot was awful. They skipped too many murder scenes that you would expect to see. I have followed the Bundy murders and read Ann Rule's book. She is spot on easily with the Bundy case but the movie was way off. I don't remember Bundy kidnapping women in parking garage in front of people. There was supposed to be a small police chase before Bundy's arrest in Utah. Not showing the State Park kidnappings was stupid. Bundy's cast was made from plaster not fabric material. Characters were not named in the movie using the real people's names like Victoria being Stephanie awful and dumb. Not much action in it like the Ted Bundy movie. The people that made this flim should have read the book themselves and read some of the facts about Ted Bundy before screwing up what could have been one of the best True Crime films instead they did it their way and made it look PG instead of R like it should be. I would not reccomend this film at all!,1340755200,4,994,4.407608695652174
2408936,2,B000B8TIKE,"Made for TV movies are lacking if that, compared to a feature film, television mini series, or even a regulat episodic TV show.  With that in mind, I was not expected much when I picked this up and even more disappointed once it was over with.  Why?  The acting was choppy, the story (even if it was fictional) was not treated that well, and we were left not thinking much of the actuality behind it.

Ann Rule has a very unique place in writing crime fiction, as she is the only crime writer who personally knew her subject before his killing began and continued to know him until his excecution.  It was an incredible twist of fate on her part, but it was also a unique opportunity to say the least.  Ann was living in Seattle in the early 1970s when she had a job working at a suicide hotline, when she met a young, charismatic man named Ted Bundy.  It was here that they became friends as coworkers, and Ted's career was on the rise in local politics.  And then women started disappearing.  When he was first arrested, Ann and the rest of his peers were baffled.  TED, a murder suspect?!  This is ridiculous, the police have clearly made a mistake here.  And then the evidence began to pile up, and all of a sudden it was clear that Ted was the one they were looking for.

From here, however, the rest of the pieces of the puzzle are put together in a rather shoddy manner.  We keep jumping from place to place and not knowing exactly what all these connections were.  Read the book, it's more of an experience than this TV movie.",1339545600,,1534,4.333333333333333
2408937,4,B000B8TIKE,"Not as good as the ""Deliberate Stranger"", better than ""Bundy: A Legacy of Evil"", around the same league as the movie simply called ""Ted Bundy"" made a few years back. A little bit ""fictionalized"", as in how the ""Boston Strangler"" movie was a fictionalized account of the true story, same goes for Ed Gein in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. Cambell plays Bundy rather well, and the woman playing Ms. Rule does her job as good also. However, having read just about everything on Ted (i'm from Starke, Fla where he was, um, ""fried""), the movie left out A LOT of Ted's nastier habits, like pedophilia, dismemberment, necrophilia & peeping tom-ism, but besides these minor faults, i liked the film, good if just for a ""passing watch"" or, if you are into true crime, serial killer stories or ""Lifetime""-like movies, than this is for you.",1323734400,3,834,4.758620689655173

I watched the movie back-to-back with a Bundy documentary and did not find the movie as bad as other reviewers have noted.  Still, if you're looking for a docu-drama, this isn't it.

I love barbara hershey - and so i will watch most anything with her in it.  the guy who played bundy was very, very good though - so worth watching just for him.  the woman who ended up marrying him has some wonderful scenes as his long suffering wife and the final scene with her in which he talks about making a ""deal"" is excellent.  enjoy it, but don't expect Kubrick or Scorsese",1305417600,,569,4.1454545454545455

8083582,4,B000B8TIKE,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2003 and directed by Paul Shapiro, Ann Rule Presents: The Stranger Beside Me (aka The Ted Bundy Story) stars Billy Campbell as the infamous serial killer and Barbara Hershey as the eponymous writer who knew him before and during his murders, as well as during his imprisonments in Colorado and Florida.

The phrase serial killer didn't exist before Bundy. His first suspected victim was when he was a paper boy in Tacoma at the age of 14. He finally officially confessed to 30 murders in 7 states from 1974 to1978, but later said there were several others and respectable estimates range from 60-100 or more. He was first locked up in Utah in 1975 for kidnapping and assault, which is shown in the movie. Bundy subsequently became a suspect in an increasing list of unsolved murders in several states. Imprisoned in Colorado for homicide, he amazingly enacted two successful escapes and committed further attacks, including three more homicides in Florida, before his ultimate apprehension in 1978. He received three death sentences in two separate trials for the Florida murders. Bundy was electrocuted in Starke, Florida, on January 24, 1989. He was 42 years-old.

Whats strange about the Bundy case is that he was a highly educated, charismatic man with Hollywood good looks. Combined with his likable gift of bullsheet he was able to dupe those closest to him, including Ann Rule, until the evidence against him piled up. This explains why one Washington woman allowed him to stay with her after he was released from confinement in Utah as a prime suspect, not to mention Kelly Parkers marriage to him while he was in prison in Florida for 11 years.

One of the first murders shown in the movie, the one that occurs in the parking garage, actually took place at a state park. Yet it successfully shows how the affable killer made himself appear harmless to his victims. Despite story changes like this, as well as obvious anachronisms, the gist of the movie account is true and the film is compelling. Campbell uncannily looks like the serial killer and does a potent portrayal. Moreover the movie inspires you to look up the facts. It also shows how women in general, and particularly nubile ones, need to be aware when dealing with strangers or dubious people and use their innate intuition, even if the person is thoroughly charming, intelligent and seems harmless. Ultra-winsome Kimberley Warnat has a small role as one of the young women who kept her wits about her and therefore was able to see the proverbial writing on the wall and escape.

This is the only movie based on Bundys crimes that Ive seen. People say that the 1986 TV movie The Deliberate Stranger more closely adheres to the facts, but that one was released almost three years before the murderers execution. This one, by contrast, fittingly shows Bundys just wages. What a sick fool and what a waste of humanity, both him and his myriad tragic victims, not to mention the dozens of nave souls he hoodwinked into believing his pathological lies thru his amiable mojo.

THE MOVIE RUNS 88 minutes and was shot in Vancouver & New Westminster, British Columbia. The script was written by Matthew McDuffie & Matthew Tabak from Ann Rules book. ADDITIONAL CAST: Kevin Dunn appears as a Seattle detective and friend of Rule while Brenda James & Suki Kaiser play Bundys oblivious lovers.

A young man carries the body or a young woman into a shed. Later he is stopped by a policman. Step out of the car. Ann Rule gets a call from Ted. There is a flashback to when a Suicide Crisis Hotline gets a call. This call is traced, the police arrive in time. Ann Rule writes true crime stories. Three years later a girls body was found. The danger in hitchhiking is real. Ted volunteers for a political campaign. Ted has changed. Ann Rule gets a call about six missing girls, about one a month. Ted asks a young woman for help with a dead battery. [No good deed ever goes unpunished is a NY city saying.] How could a young woman disappear without a trace? There are hundreds of Teds who drive a VW in a hundred mile radius. How many match the description? They show how Ted picks up another victim - he pretends to be a cop - he has identification! Note how he affects familiarity! But she gets away! He tries again and succeeds.

Her body and three others are found. Then he is stopped by a policeman and taken in. Are those burglary tools? There are three missing girls in Utah. This makes the national news. Ted call Ann Rule for help. Did he see a lawyer? A publisher offers a book deal to Ann. The police concentrate on Ted Bundy and the circumstantial evidence. Ann cant believe it. An ex-girlfriend tells Ann about Ted and his behavior. Ted was released and is back in Seattle. He was raised by a single mother; his grandparents helped. Ted is found guilty in Utah and gets 1 to 15 years. Colorado wants to extradite him. Ann loves her work as a writer. Who humiliated Ted? Ann feels guilty in not seeing any signs in Teds behavior. Ted escaped from jail in Colorado and fled to Florida. He looks for another victim and enters a big house, going from room to room. He rushes out, a student screams! Then he is stopped and arrested. He is still a monster. Ted calls Ann Rule and still claims innocence. [Has his personality changed?]

Ted displays personal charm and acts as his own lawyer. Young women attend the trial; a fan club? Ted has a friend now, Kelly believes in him. An expert testifies about bite mark evidence. [Is this still considered reliable?] Ted shows his cleverness in answering questions. They jury says guilty as charged! A young woman tells how the victims resembled her. Ann learns more about Teds background. His grandfather was a violent man. A girlfriend testifies in favor of Ted. He proposes in front of a judge and she accepts. That makes them married under Florida law. Ted insists he didn't do the murders at that sorority house. Ted gets a death sentence, the judge comments on Teds personality. Ann Rule visits him in prison and asks about Sara Jane Sweeney. Can she understand Ted? Ted denies doing it still. Then he tries to put off the death sentence by offering to reveal where the missing bodies are! This deal is refused. The sentence is carried out.

But we don't know why he did it. Are some people just bad and get a thrill from killing? Is there any way to determine this beforehand? Serial murderers are hard to catch because there is no previous connection between the victim and the killer. Most murders occur between people who know each other. Usually it involves love or money. Does the ease of travel allow serial killers the opportunity? Beware of any person who tries to manipulate your thinking, especially a stranger. This story tells nothing about Teds upbringing as a boy and teenager. Could he really have first killed at age fourteen?",1454112000,,3555,4.515527950310559
