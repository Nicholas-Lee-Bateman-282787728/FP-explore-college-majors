8166610,5,B000M5KA08,"First off, let me say that this is an amazing show, not to mention one that is overlooked way way too often. The only real problem i have is that i don't think the DVD format does this show justice in terms of visual quality. This show deserves the blue ray treatment and anyone who is a fan of this show will understand why i say that. The visuals and audio tracks are amazing to begin with, but why constrain the show to the dvd format?",1270252800,2,438,4.104651162790698
8166611,5,B000M5KA08,"Anime with two seasons are great. The first season, while good on its own, serves as an introduction. The second season takes the audience's familiarity with the series and tries to spin it into new areas. It worked for Production I.G.s other series GitS:SAC, and a similar approach can be observed here in IGPX.

You know from the end of last season, that !!SPOILERS!! Team Satomi won the championship. /END. Well, the second season starts with dealing with the pressure of wining. On top of that, as early as the second match something happens that totally changes the face of the game. While the first season focused mainly on Team Satomi, this season the other teams are featured more noticeably. The action gets kicked up a few notches and finishes with something too crazy/awesome to be believed/spoiled.

The unique voice cast are all present. And, of course, there's a great set of extras including Voice Actor interviews, and commentary on four episodes. Also the language is turned up a bit for the second half of the series. Nothing taboo, not the Four Letter Words, just the normal: Hell, Damn, Crap.

Sometimes I worry that I simply buy every anime I watch and that I don't really like them. But I popped IGPX in on a whim and still managed to watch the whole series. Get it before it's gone.",1264377600,,1305,4.689956331877729
8166612,4,B000M5KA08,This season was pretty solid. There were definitely some unexpected twists and turns throughout. The only issue I had was that in the beginning of the season there was a lot of forced tension. No one really got along with anyone else on the team. This resolves in time and has a much anticipated climactic end.,1234051200,,310,4.553571428571429
8166613,5,B000M5KA08,"Here i go again so i bought the first season and loved it and now i've bought the second season anyway in this season there not the rookies anymore there the champions and the team to beat!

With a shakey start they lose alot of confidence and start looking slopy then takeshi finaly wakes up and start's acting like the champion he truly is and with the help of his teamates and some new help with some old skills (when one of there teamates gets hurt) nothing can stop Team Satomi.

Oh and with this season you can realate to takeshi not like last season when alot of people realated to river now i bet most people relate to takeshi cause he lets him being the champion go to his head and makes him lose sight of whats really going on.

last season proboly had a bit more action well both the seasons even out but with this season there are alot of answers where they left off of the first season.

well this is the final season (wish there were more on the way but i guess not =[) so prepare for a good one cause it rocks oh and theres a new team called white snow (this years rookies) (thow there not really pure) replaceing team black egg.

Well i hope you buy this season (of corse after you buy the first lol) trust me you won't regret it if you like Racing,robots and fighting with some drama so go and buy it already..........

........ oh and do i smell love in the air?",1218153600,,1380,4.169172932330827
8166614,5,B000M5KA08,"This is the second and final season of IGPX and its just as action packed as the first one! This time the main characters are the champions and ever other team is out to get them. There really isn't much to say if you saw my review for the first season, its all the same action packed series with alittle twist and a little more action. Its great! For all out there who love action anime this one is for you. (Dont forget to buy the first season before this one) Its just a suggestion!",1217203200,,485,4.11578947368421
8166615,4,B000M5KA08,"While I normally wouldn't review IGPX DVDs outside of my website, I think it is worth mentioning one big point that I believe consumers need to know before going out to buy this set on this site. The 5.1 Surround sound does not work properly. Instead of providing genuine 5.1 channels of sound, it fronts all 5 channels to the front 3 channels, and then the back 2 channels barely output any sound. Bandai (the publisher/distributor) won't fix it or replace it because it still outputs some sound, so they can claim that it is a 5.1 mix, but anyone with a 5.1 setup can tell it is not.

I am still giving it 4 stars for a rating because that only affects about 1% of the consumers buying this set. That's because the 2.0 mix works fine. It is definitely something you should know before buying. It's actually rather odd, as the Season 1 set and all other IGPX DVDs prior did not have this problem. It's a big deal to me, because I am an audiophile. It's not just that-it's just I really wanted to hear these episodes in 5.1 sound. However, that issue doesn't change the 2.0 Stereo mix, and that is awesome. The music and sound effects that were added/changed from the other volumes for the Toonami version that was aired on TV are all excellent. While some episodes suffer from a few seconds of cut footage, the majority stay in tact, and provide excellent sound experiences.

Also keep in mind that there is no Japanese audio, but that's what the other DVDs are for. This set also includes numerous extras, including audio commentary for some episodes, and promos. Overall, you will likely appreciate this set if your a fan of the show, and don't mind some cut footage. Just be warned that if you are that 1% who is buying this thinking you'll hear true 5.1 surround sound, you won't. I thought I could actually get into these sound mixes, but I was very disappointed. At least I can somewhat enjoy them, but it is really sad to listen to stereo quality sound (especially when the other DVDs are 5.1 quality) on a 5.1 system.",1184544000,6,2026,4.472972972972973
8166616,4,B000M5KA08,"Although this season wasn't quite as climactic as the first one, it's still exciting and fun to watch.",1178409600,,102,4.722222222222222
