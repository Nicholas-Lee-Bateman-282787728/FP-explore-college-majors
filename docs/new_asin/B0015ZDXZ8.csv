8260564,5,B0015ZDXZ8,What a fun behind the scenes video...I still would like to know where they filmed True besides a beach in California...I kinda figured that one out...some of the images in Taylor Swift's Style remind me a lot of True and I wonder if both were filmed in the same location...love the location...anyways...always fun to see behind the scenes stuff especially when Ryan Cabrera is involved...he is just so much fun...he makes you feel like you are hanging out with him and along for the ride...always fun hangin out with Ryan...he is just a really fun guy...more more more....never can get enough....,1429920000,,596,4.910891089108911
