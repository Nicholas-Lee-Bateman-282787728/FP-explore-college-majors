2213275,5,B0007IO6PA,"I have been waiting SO long for Bob Newhart to come out on DVD.  Thank you, to whoever made this happen! This is a fabulous product, and I recommend it to everyone!",1111017600,8,164,4.125
2213276,5,B0007IO6PA,"I don't remember a television show that was as funny as The Bob Newhart Show.  The staid, professional Dr. Hartley and his wife are surrounded by a parade of the wackiest neighbors, colleagues and friends that one could imagine.  Even Dr. Hartley's ""group"" is an hysterical array of people who somehow make even those in for psychological help seem funny without making fun of their individual problems.  This show is classic Newhart.  It is not slapstick or in-your-face humor nor is it anything like the comedy seen on television today.  Bob Newhart is subtle and timed with absolute precision.  Bob's facial expression (or should I say lack of one) tells us that something funny is about to happen.  You won't go wrong getting The Bob Newhart Show if you love wonderful, colorful characters, first-rate writing and everyday situations which are full of humor and wit.",1109980800,133,870,4.958620689655173

2213278,5,B0007IO6PA,"The Bob Newhart show is a classic comedy, backed by an excellent supporting cast and wonderful writing. This show is as clever as any top notch comedy today. After looking at a list of all the episodes in season one, many of them are some of the funniest i remember during the entire run of the show. I'm so glad this show is finally being released. Other great news to share. Mary Tyler Moore Season Two will FINALLY be released this summer! Hallelujah!!",1109376000,47,455,4.493975903614458

2213300,5,B0007IO6PA,"Whether this is your first time or you are purchasing old times, this series is a lot of fun to watch and afterwards speculate on what the outcome would be. Many short programs have created a situation and solve it all in the span of the episode. Where as the Bob Newhart show many times steps right into the middle and does not necessarily wrap up all the loose end.

I am not convincing that the episodes are in the correct order. It seems strange that Fly the unfriendly skies would be the first episode as it does not really introduce the characters or give much of a background. I also notice that Suzanne Pleshette's hair style keeps changing back and forth.

Something strange that I have not been able to figure out is why every time Bob comes home and Margaret Hoover (Patricia Smith) is just leaving he just says ""Hello Margaret"" in a deadpan voice without looking at her.

One of the main things that add to the viewing comedy is the nuances and glances each character gives each other.",1504656000,,997,4.467032967032967

2213330,5,B0007IO6PA,"I had forgotten about this show until I started watching reruns of it on an oldies TV channel.  The late-night commercials were driving me insane, though, so I rented Season 1 from Netflix DVD.  (This show would be a great addition to Amazon Prime! Netflix only has Season 1 right now.)  Not all the episodes are funny, but even the ""bad"" episodes usually have a few hilarious scenes or lines in them.  The ""good"" episodes are hysterically funny.  I was surprised to notice what I thought were flaws in the series, however, stuff I never noticed in the 1980s.  For example, I thought Jennifer Holmes' character Leslie wasn't particularly funny, even when she had great lines.  Mary Frann also seemed to be overacting as Dick's wife in this first season.  In addition, Steven Kampmann, as Kirk Devane, would be a riot in one episode and totally irritating in another.  One of the greatest episodes of the first season was when Kirk said the cafe had been robbed, the insurance man comes over to the inn to question Dick and George, and Kirk ends up having to take a lie detector test. (""The Boy who Cried Goat"".)  Another one where I could not stop laughing was when Dick was playing golf and cards with Chester, Jim and Doc, and he could not lose to save his life.  (""I Enjoy Being A Guy"".)

P.S. 5/31: Since writing the above review, I have been watching episodes from all the season, and have been truly surprised to see so many duds.  How many shallow Stephanie storylines can there be?  How many Larry, Darryl and Darryl introductions can you have?  In addition, Mary Frann went from being a too adoring wife to an irritated and irritating wife.  Plus, Bob Newhart is totally unfunny in many episodes.  It seems like the more unfunny an episode, the wilder and louder the audience laughter is, too. Yeah, sure.  Not that there aren't some jewels mixed in with all the duds . . . like the Halloween episode . . . the book show episode with the retired Air Force guy . . . the final episode . . . but just don't expect to be so enchanted with the series after watching the seasons after the first one.",1487203200,,2103,4.489473684210527
2213331,5,B0007IO6PA,"I remember when this was on in the 80's and didn't pay much attention to it because I wasn't interested in the ""old people"" in it.  Well... I am 40 now, and am obsessed with this show.  Bob Newhart is comic genius - most sitcoms begin slow, but this one does not.  If you are looking for 80's nostalgia without the sticky sweet plots, this show is for you. Great cast, love it!",1486857600,5,377,4.136986301369863

2213336,5,B0007IO6PA,"I like the first two seasons of ""Newhart"" the best when ""Kirk Devane,"" the Minuteman Cafe's owner and curmudgeon, often stole the show from Bob Newhart.  Sadly, he disappeared in the second season when the show was reworked.  The first season seemed split between the first few shows and later shows as to how it was filmed.  The first few shows seemed filmed live.  Later seasons with Peter Scolari as ""Michael Harris"" started out fun but seemed to become tedious over time.  Larry, Daryl and Daryl were the best throughout the series.  Eventually,  I lost interest in the show after it jumped the shark and new born ""Baby Stephanie"" owned and controlled WPIV.  However, I'm glad I tuned in for the finale which was great.",1483574400,2,723,4.728

Bob Newhart is one of the funniest ever, and Mary Frann made a lovely counterpart. Tom Poston is, as always, a delight as the absent-minded handyman.

I give it four stars because my only complaint is with the actual DVD transfer. It's stretched out to the widescreen aspect ratio, and it just feels a little off from the way it was meant to be watched (in its original 4:3, 1970s television aspect ratio).",1476748800,2,354,4.515625

Dr. Hartley with  his dead pan matter of fact Psychology practice in Chicago, and his gorgeous wife Emily who teaches 4th graders....Set in Chicago,...my favorite part is the beginning of the show where Bob is seencoming out of his building on a typical cold Chicago late afternoon headed home to his high rise condo via the streets and trains of Chicago.

Interestingly enough he is not shot, mugged or otherwise molested as he walks the streets of Chicago and uses mass transit to return home.

Jerry the Dentist, Carol the receptionist, Howard the airline navigator (back when they had three or even four ""up front"")  And of course the selection of characters that represented the patients of Dr. Hartley.

2213519,4,B0007IO6PA,"This successful sitcom that ran on CBS from 1982-90 was about a do-it-yourself books author, Dick Lourdon(Bob Newhart)and wife, Joanna(Mary Frann)who move from New York to a small remote town in Vermont to operate a 200-year old resort. Dick is the same mild-mannered everyman surrounded by a community of oddballs in a town which exists in an illogical world run by rules that elude him.

Tom Poston(George), previously from MORK & MINDY is now Dick & Joanna's hard-working, but somewhat dimwitted handyman.
Peter Scolari(Michael Harris), previously from BOSOM BUDDIES, is the hyperactive, persuasive producer of Dick's talk show who eventually marries the spoiled rich, world class skier, Leslie Vanderkillen(Jennifer Holmes).

This 1982-1983 Season takes me back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""Great Moments""

NEWHART was a solid ratings winner throughout its whole 8-year run on CBS  finishing 6 out of 8 seasons in the Nielsen's top 25 at its highest rating of 12 for 2 consecutive seasons from 1986 to 1988.  NEWHART's ratings were high enough to kick off a 9th Season in the Fall of 1990, but Bob Newhart was getting tired and declined and wanted to move onto other projects, so NEWHART had its series finale in the Spring of 1990.

In the meantime, I sometimes watch NEWHART in reruns on Antenna TV now along with MR. BELVEDERE.",1420675200,,1342,5.0225225225225225

2213522,1,B0007IO6PA,"This was a great show later on but season one just didn't have it.  I agree with another reviewer who said if you want the entire sets go through this one as fast as possible.  There are a few good shows but only a few.  The Kirk character was horrible and dragged the show down.  He wasn't funny, just obnoxious and completely unnecessary to use in the show.
The writers must have liked him because he was in almost every show and even through the entire second season even using him in the very last scene.  But do hang on, in season three he is gone forever and good riddance.  The show picks up  after that and is a keeper.",1419033600,,627,4.175
2213523,5,B0007IO6PA,"Great serie! I was born  1973, so was one year old when the show was first on. Guess I don't remember much of it:). I did see it in later years as a kid. Now as adult I see it  in different manner. Just a great show With wonderful Bob! Good quality t.v program With finely tuned jokes and many good star guests. but I won't spoil and say  who. Frankly, I think until 1988 t.v was of good quality. and it went downhill f rom 1988 With many shows on supernatural stuff,  sex, violence, etc. Without the Internet in the 70s(and me now  don't even have mobile phone no pc)I FEEL IT MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENCE also on t.v!! And those who see a lot of series from before 1990 know what I talk about.

2213543,5,B0007IO6PA,"Thank heaven for this release!  And at this price it is almost crazy NOT to buy it.  This was comedic TV at its finest.  It is the first season of one of the greatest sitcoms I have ever enjoyed watching--and I've been watching them for a LONG time--since I Love Lucy, right through Seinfeld et. al. in the later 90's. Sadly all this narcissistic reality drivel has absolutely turned me off from regular TV--but I do have many seasons of my favorite shows from the Twilight Zone, to Mike Hammer, to the Rifleman, and many others--and now I have at least one season of Newhart.  Normally I would be giddy (like ""Giddy Giddy Goose""--you Newhart fans will know whereof I speak!) at the prospect of getting all of the seasons.  Alas! I'm noting that many of the later releases are clearly ""syndicated"" (as per reviews I've seen)---and that means ""clipped"".... I think I'll pass on that.  20th Century Fox seems to have released this issue--and while some may complain about it being in mono, and not having all the ""extras""... I bought it for this GREAT show... and they're all there. Un ""clipped""... no syndication logo anywhere--many lines you'll never hear in the syndicated episodes. That's ""extra"" enough for me! It's really a pity that 20th Century didn't do the following seasons with equal justice to all episodes.  That said--I love this set.  It is nostalgic, and it is funny.  Personally, I liked Kampmann a hundred times better than that incredibly annoying Michael who came in full annoying bloom by season 3. I will say that Duffy was a better (and funnier) maid than was Leslie--yet there was still a certain charm about the character that keeps season one as my favorite year of the series.  Steve Kampmann had an uncanny way of letting the lines of lies roll off his tongue one after another--each funnier than the previous. I loved all of the seasons of this comedy--Newhart's dry wit, the incredibly funny in his own goofy way the very droll handyman played by Tom Posten, the weird citizenry of wherever this is in Vermont--and his fantastic looking wife... Mary  Frann (who left us far too early) who had her own quirks--each character so unique and yet so very entertaining. I know it's been said many times they don't make 'em like this any more--but it's true... they just don't.  Heck if this keeps up--I'll just sit back with my TV and all my DVD's and go on a retro trip back to whatever era I wish to and enjoy TV from a time when it was just that -- ""enjoyable"" --who needs cable anymore?....Finally, addressing the ""family friendly"" comments, I must make a slight addendum--while this is certainly true for the overwhelming majority of episodes of the show, there were, on occasion some risque adult innuendos--but they were more often than not (with the exception of the episode ""What is this thing called lust?"") very subtle and quite family friendly, certainly far more family fare than the boldly openly bawdy tripe offered up on today's shows. If you liked good comedy--you'll be glad you got this one.",1413504000,2,3033,4.723484848484849

I loved it from the first episode through the end of the eight year run. I purchased the first DVD when it became available and waited and waited for what seemed forever for season two. I bought it immediately and discovered SHOUT is set to release season three in April. It is long past time this entire series is available for everyone who wants to enjoy it. Others have made excellent observations about the characters, the wit and charm and the genuine fondness of or better yet, the chemistry of the cast. I love this show and Bob Newhart will always have a special place in my heart. It is almost criminal that it has taken this long for this wonderful and funny, as well as original, series to finally make it to season three. I just hope the good folks at SHOUT don't stop with half of the seasons, like others did with Green Acres and Caroline In The City. Both of these shows were favorites and only three of the six Green Acres seasons were released and only two of the four Caroline In The City. If you enjoy comedy that is not over the top with outstanding acting, great characters and yes an innocence to it, this series is for you. Thank you SHOUT for finally bringing this series to DVD. Just please release the entire eight seasons ASAP.

2213586,5,B0007IO6PA,"Bob Newhart is truly an American original--distinctive low-key humor that sets him apart.  All of his series are marked by TALENT rather than obsenity or put-downs to others, as all too many flash-in-the-pan comedians rely on.  This is my favorite of his series, very low-key, and often too real (I grew up in a small town, and can relate to some of the ecentric characters/guests that ran throughout the show).  I was delighted to find the first in the series for sale, and there are many interesting things about it.  The first season has a cozy, intimate setting rather than the impersonal studio-audience ""laugh-tracks"" feel.  It had been awhile since I've seen the series since, sadly, Bob ANYTHING seems to be lacking from TV these days.  So, it reintruced me to how Dick & Joanna came to buy the inn, the meeting of original characters, and some great storylines.  Great television!",1388188800,,889,4.847682119205298

Doesn't even come close to the original Classic Bob Newhart Show, it rates a MINUS FIVE, but amazon does NOT allow it!

Perfect example of how you can NOT ""have 2 bites at the cherry"" and create 2 Classics!
The original Bob Newhart Show is a CLASSIC! Bob was always going to have trouble creating new characters anything like Howard, Jerry and Mr Carlin! But this is crap! Especially the episodes with Kirk the half-wit compulsive liar! There are ONLY 2 funny episodes (disc 2 #14, and disc 3 #22 and last of season 1) and a few smirks in some others. George (Tom Poston) is funny, and there's NOT much of Larry, Daryl & Daryl in season 1, (with their salute to The Marx Bros) they got the show to a second season. It's obvious Bob had NO input into the characters and casting on this awful excuse for a comedy, and it shows the producers and writers were amateurs!

The ONLY good thing about season 1 is 20CFOX did NOT screw it up by putting episodes on both sides of the discs, like they screwed up The ALL-TIME CLASSIC BOB NEWHART SHOW!!!",1361145600,,1062,4.353535353535354

2213630,4,B0007IO6PA,"Since there aren't any wholesome clean shows that I can find, I have to resort back to the '30's through the '80's
to find them. I do not watch but a minute amount of television because there is nothing really worth watching in the way
of wholesome, clean shows. However, my family did enjoy the Newhart sitcom and unfortunately, I cannot find any more than the first season. Altho, I believe it says on the dvd that seasons 1-4 are available, I cannot find them on Amazon.
I do not like the character that Steven Kampmann plays. It's really dumb. But the trio, Larry, Darryl, and Darryl came along (and is only seen maybe in two shows on this dvd) and kept this show alive. I didn't care for Stephanie who replaced her cousin in the first season b/c she was shallow and would have gotten along with the Steven Kampmann in the first season--they were so much alike. It's a shame that the producers didn't keep Leslie on throughout Newhart years along with the rest of the cast, excluding of course, Kampmann's part.

2213666,4,B0007IO6PA,"Bob Newhart was four years removed from his first CBS sitcom when he stepped into this one, which finds him playing a how-to book writer who decides to have a go at running a rustic Vermont inn.  He and his wife, Joanna (played by the gorgeous and talent Mary Frann), deal with the normal run of tourists and locals as they get adjusted to their new life.  That includes Tom Poston, a good friend of Newhart's who played the inn's caretaker, George Utley; Steven Kampmann, who wrote for another CBS sitcom, ""WKRP in Cincinnati"", as the pathological owner of the Minuteman Cafe, Kirk Devane; and Jennifer Holmes, who played student and skier Leslie Vanderkellen.  Along the way, a number of other stars make appearances, including Howard Dodson (Jack Sprague from ""Andy Griffith""), Rue McClanahan (Blanche Devereaux from ""The Golden Girls""), Daniel J. Travanti (Captain Frank Furillo from ""Hill Street Blues"") and Julia Duffy (who appears in one episode at Leslie's cousin, Stephanie, and plays the character much differently than how she defined the role in later seasons).

The first season of ""Newhart"" was shot on live-look videotape, like many other sitcoms of the era (including ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Kate & Allie"").  Later seasons were shot on film and on videotape processed to look like film.  But that's part of the charm of the show, as is the fact that you can actually see the actors shaping and molding their characters in each episode.  They're not yet ""set"" into a predictable pattern.  They're growing as you watch.  The acting is very good, but I'm inclined to agree with other posters that it does get better as the seasons progress - especially as Stephanie and the brothers Larry, Darryl and Darryl (William Sanderson, Tony Papenfuss and John Volstad) - become integral characters.

Regardless of whether 20th Century-Fox, the company that owns the MTM library, releases additional seasons, if you're a fan of the show or a fan of Bob Newhart, you really owe it to yourself to pick up the first season of ""Newhart"".",1297987200,3,2035,4.906705539358601

George Utley, as the resident handyman, is a pretty strong character right from the beginning.  Larry and the two Darryls appear in a few episodes; thankfully, they'll appear more prominently in later seasons.

Watch these shows again or for the first time. It's nothing but a lot of innocent comedy.

2213686,3,B0007IO6PA,"It's a shame, however logical the choice might be, that the almost unrecognizable first season of Newhart is the one that Fox decided to test the waters with. Honestly, they may have been better served releasing seasons 3-8 and then doling out 1 and 2 for the completists (like myself).

I watched Newhart religiously in the mid/late 80s, but missed the first few seasons when it originally aired. When one of the cable networks aired the series in reruns about 10 years ago or so, it was jarring to see how different the first season was from the rest. The visual style, the absence of many familiar recurring characters, and the abominable original version of Kirk all made me wonder if I was watching the same show that I remembered so fondly.

So much changed once they got to the second season episodes. The visual style changed, the cast was tweaked, and the ""Wacky Vermont Ensemble"" that became the show's lifeblood started coming to life. THAT was when the show took its first steps towards ""classic"" territory. The first season is like a 24-episode screen test or demo reel compared to the rest of the series.

I did purchase the first season out of a need for completion, as well as to add my bucks to the cause of hopefully showing the manufacturers that later seasons of this landmark show need to be released (along with the rest of original Bob Newhart Show). The discs and packaging are fine, and the picture and sound are good, especially considering the source material. However, I will probably never watch this season more than one time.

I really hope to own the rest of this series in the future. Is it so wrong to want Edwin Newman calling Dick Loudon a ""weenie"" in my collection for posterity?",1273536000,10,1716,4.634868421052632

2213705,4,B0007IO6PA,"The first season of this show was good.  I'd rate it as 3.5 stars if Amazon let us use half stars.  It's biggest problem in the first season was using a character named Kirk.  Ultimately you were supposed to like him but that never happened.  He was given too many problems and also was not funny.  Bob Newhart was great, of course.  We got George the Handyman and then Larry and the Darryls showed up (as very minor characters).  Michael, Stephanie, the tv show, etc., were all to come in future seasons.  The last season is as weak as this first one with the golden shows being the ones inbetween.

Any Bob Newhart is better than no Bob Newhart though.  Bob is great on the show from episode one to the end.  He never disappoints.  I am a big fan of his.  If you are too, then you can't go wrong. He plays an Innkeeper in Vermont with his wife JoAnna.  They slowly are assimilated into a New England town of characters. Newhart is everyone's comic foil.  He and Poston worked together in his prior series so they are an old ""couple"" at this point and gel from the start.  His wife is good, not as good as Suzanne Pleshette was in his earlier show but she does ok.  Newhart also writes do-it-yourself books and he is quite comedic about these as well.

I would say the creators probably saw John Cleese's FAWLTY TOWERS before doing this show.  However, Newhart is a very different comedian than Cleese so it had to be tailored to suit him.  Thus, the only resemblance is that they are both married innkeepers doing a sitcom set in their Inns.

But the amazing big point is that this show got off to a rousing start! (Despite the presumptive pilot episode when Bob plays the typicak frantic sitcom husband who really wants a kid). It seems the characters are fully developed - if the set contains shooting dates, I missed it - but unlike so many sitcoms (even the classics like The Honeymooners, Seinfeld, The Odd Couple) which had that rough-around-the-edges exaggeration in the early stages. Jerry and Carol, especially, are right on the money; in fact, Carol is perhaps even funnier and sexier than in later years. Another plus is that Howard, the out of sorts next door neighbor who happens to be an airline pilot (the writers stretched a bit on that deal), has less tod o and that's good. Want a character to slow down the works with a spaced out soliliqy? - that's what we got more and more of as the series progressed but that character never did.
We also have the benefit of no ""Bob's sister"", who was omnipresent in later seasons. A very dull and unnecessary addition - the writers apparently thought she'd make a good helpmate for Borden. It was grueling.
It's easy to throw in the word ""dated"", but it's really unavoidable, and even some of the best-loved characters, including Mr. Carlin, are just too unbelievable.
A highlight of this set is the episode with Chuck McCann, as a noisy co-vacationer, who stays at the adjoining cabine (or room)...no problem sharing the bathroom with Bob and Emily. They're staying at a mountain retreat, with just two other folks, and the four or five staffers who at as waiters, entertainers, social directors, whatever.

2213739,4,B0007IO6PA,"I love the comedy of Bob Newhart. This was one of my favorite shows growing up. I guess I may have been a bit too young when the series started (Season 1) because I really didn't remember Leslie (Jennifer Holmes) from the show. And I only have a couple of vague recollections of Kirk (Steve Kampmann) which must be from Season 2 when they replaced Leslie with her cousin Stephanie (Julia Duffy). After watching this set, and some later season re-runs of the show, I think that I actually like Leslie better than Stephanie. I'd have to say it's a toss-up between Kirk and Michael (Peter Scolari) who ended up replacing him. The rest of the main cast - Dick (Bob), Joanna (Mary Frann), and George (Tom Poston) - and the wacky Vermont locals - including Larry, his brother Darryl, and his other brother Darryl who went from a one-time spot to regulars - are as great and hilarious in this 1st season as they were in the rest of the show's run.
On to the minor complaints about the Special Features. The feature about the show's inspiration (Guess Who's Coming to Bed and Breakfast?) was interesting, but I kinda hoped it would be a bit longer and more in-depth. The cast feature (What a Cast!) was pretty nice. I liked hearing that Larry, Darryl, and Darryl were supposed to be a one-time deal but were brought back regularly because of the studio audience reaction to them. Just think if Newhart had not been taped before a live audience!?! I also like hearing the cast members reminisce about the late Mary Frann and Tom Poston. During all of the interviews I wondered where ""Brother Darryl"" was. During a lot of the featurettes there was one thing that I had a problem with, and that was the fact that this is a Season 1 box set but a lot of the commentary had to do with the later seasons of the show. Especially during the fashion featurette (You Really Should Wear More Sweaters) they had a lot of focus on Joanna's sweaters - which became more of a thing in later seasons based on her wardrobe seen in these episodes - and a lot of discussion of Stephanie's fashion sense by Julia Duffy herself. There was no discussion of the spunky college-girl fashion sense of Leslie, or the overall-and-flannel wardrobe of George, or the brothers of ""Anything for a Dollar"", or even Dick and the cardigan sweater that he wore to the Town Council meeting. I would have liked to see more about the actual cast of Season 1 and the behind-the-scenes stuff from Season 1 in the Special Features on a Season 1 box set. There could have at least been something about why Stephanie went from a one-time guest spot to becoming the replacement for her cousin Leslie - although that might actually be more appropriate for the Season 2 box set when it comes out.",1231718400,,2742,4.519114688128773

I was a bit nervous about viewing it again since often things aren't as funny as you remember and you end up being disappointed.  That is definitely not the case with ""Newhart"".  Not only do my husband and I still think the show is hilarious, my 14-year-old daughter who wasn't even alive back then, thinks it's great and wants to watch each episode with us.  In fact, she is the one that wants to watch this between school and starting her homewwork as her break-time.  What an endorsement !

The series utlizes Bob Newhart's talent to the fullest.  He can be about the funniest person alive by doing absolutely nothing but standing totally still and blinking rapidly.  The supporting cast gives him wonderful characters to play off of and Tom Poston is histerical as George.  This is clean fun that gets its laughs through creativity and good writing  -- much different that those today that depend on crude body noises for a laugh.

In the case of Newhart (and also of Barney Miller), the first season is not as good as the subsequent seasons.  This is primarily because of the first season cast. Jennifer Holmes, as Leslie Vanderkellen, student/maid, is pretty & charming & sweet.  And also forgettable.  When Julia Duffy, as her sassy, conceited cousin Stephanie Vanderkellen, joins the cast, she brings a sparkle and a spice to the show that Jennifer just couldn't achieve.

Steven Kampmann is attractive but the character of Kirk is not well written.  He does grow on me as the season progresses, and I will probably miss him when he leaves at the end of season 2, but he's not Peter Scolari.

And of course there's very little of Larry, his brother Daryl, and his other brother Daryl in season 1--only 2 appearances.  As I watched these shows, I kept wondering where they were.

The first season was the worst of the seasons. The Newhart show greatly improved after the first season (but, alas - you can't buy them).

Joanna (Mary Frann) was a good ""straight man"" for Dick Louden (Bob Newhart).

George (Tom Poston) is always fun and a great attribute on the show. He and Bob Newhart had great chemistry.

Even though Leslie is a bit wooden, she's still pleasant in the cast. After being replaced by Stephanie (Julia Duffy), the show starts getting kicked into high gear. Alas, that happens in the second season - which you can't buy.

The Kirk character was a waste of space. A very shallow, one-dimensional character and becomes very annoying and predictable in short order. Ironically, his character develops a little better in the second season, before he's gone from the show (sorry - you still can't buy the second season...)

Larry and Darryl and Darryl show up twice toward the end of the season. They figure more prominently after the first season. They're a good addition and their presence and bizarre antics are a great augmentation to Dick Louden's character. They're available more after the first season... sorry. Again, no dice.

2213761,5,B0007IO6PA,Bob Newhart is one of comedy's most talented members.  The original Bob Newhart Show was a superbly written and wonderfully casted classic and Newhart is no exception.  Bob's classic timing and dead-pan stares are unbelievably funny.  He proves that his talent is not limited to or dependent on anything but the sheer talent that he personifies.  I do hope that the subsequent seasons will not be withheld from fans.  Despite an enormous outpouring of demands for the final seasons of The Bob Newhart Show--it is yet to be released.  It truly amazes me that shows with less viewers and much less talent can be brought out in their entirety--and shows like The Bob Newhart Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show can be left to obscurity.,1217548800,3,732,4.76984126984127

I'm almost halfway through and I can see Suzanne's character change to what we all remember her as, so savvy, not the typical housewife.  One thing I do notice, the interaction and admiration between the husband and wife.  As far as the other characters I am not too impressed, you see too much of the airline navigator/neighbor stopping by too much and too much of Jerry Robinson, the Dentist.  It's usually Bob's patients that will generally make you laugh and I hope to see more of them in the upcoming seasons.  I am not so happy with the way it was restored.  The color seems very brown and the audio is terrible compared to most shows, but it is the 1st season.  And as far as I can see, no great special features on this one.

2213774,5,B0007IO6PA,"I have finally watched all of the episodes on the ""Newhart - Season 1"" discs!  I remember watching these episodes when they first debuted in 1982 when I was a teenager.  The atmosphere of the Stratford Inn brought back a lot of great memories of the 80s, but potential viewers and fans have to understand that Bob and the creators were attempting to bring together the success elements that would eventually launch this series as the greatest sitcom of the 80s.  Season 1 is not my favorite season, but since it's the start of a great comedy legacy, I have to give it 5 stars!

THE PROS:
1. Bob - 'Nuf Said
2. Mary Frann was spectacular as Joanna Loudon.  She eventually blossoms into the role and puts her own comedic spin into the role in future seasons of Newhart.
3. Tom Poston's depiction of George Utley is dead on funny!  And the reaction of Dick Loudon's face is always priceless to the offbeat things that George comments on.
4. Jim and Chester - The 2 Town Selectmen make a solid debut as the two local bumpkins and they are on the launching pad for great comedy as well. Check 'em out in the last episode on this set, ""I Love Being A Guy"" - the poker game scene is hilarious!
5. The Stratford Inn - The elegant dining room and the comfortable looking lobby just adds to the Vermont atmosphere.
6. Recommended Episodes: The one with the witch buried in the Stratford's basement; the one where Joanna falls into the icy pond; the one where Dick, George, and Kirk go to the basketball game; the one where George thinks that he sees the UFO.
7. The promise of Season 2 with more Stephanie and Larry, Darrel, Darrel.

The Cons:
1. Kirk Devane: Probably one of the most annoying sitcom characters ever created, but he has his purpose in eventually vacating the MinuteMan cafe in Season 2 when Larry, Darrel, Darrel take over and drive the laughs in hyperdrive!
2. Leslie Vanderkellen - A very wooden performance from Jennifer Holmes.  The only time I witnessed any character animation was in the episode when Kirk's grandmother(wonderfully played by Ruth Gordon!).  Leslie actually smiles and talks and moves and everything in this episode.  Thankfully, she exits the series after the debut season.
3. Underutilizing Stephanie Vanderkellen - Julia Duffy appeared in one episode of Season 1 and her comedic talents are greatly underutilized and she comes across as almost too serious for the way her great character eventually blossoms.  Thank God - Julia Duffy will be back in Season 2 - BRING HER ON! And, equally fantastic, will be the debut of Peter Scolari's hilarious, selfish and vain, Michael Harris in Season 2!
4. Underutilizing Larry, Darrel, Darrel - The trio appear in 2 episodes and they are hysterical in their enthusiasm in digging up the 200-year-old witch and serving the convicts at the MinuteMan cafe while Kirk is recovering from surgery.

Overall, if you are a Bob Newhart fan, you will not be disappointed in Season 1 of ""Newhart"" as there are great comedic moments in this set.  However, when Season 2 debuts and Kirk and Leslie exit the series, and Stephanie and Michael enter the series, the comedy rocket definitely leaves the launch pad!

  The first year was good. The shows got better with clever and refreshing plots. The first year was tough. It is not easy to design a new show with a new group of characters. As time moved on the show was refined and improved. As the years flew by the show became a one of the all-time greats.
  I remember we would go almost a week without watching any T.V. When Monday came about there was Murphy Brown, Designing Women, and NEWHART! It was the best T.V. night.
  My children grew up in the 90's. We had copied almost all the shows. We began to watch it again with the guys. A new generation fell in love with this creative show. It didn't take them too long to view all the shows. They still love watching this CLEAN show!

2213789,4,B0007IO6PA,"I've been eagerly awaiting the DVD release of Newhart ever since it stopped running in syndication in the U.S. The first season is a great start, but I hope Fox doesn't abort the run in mid-stride like they have with other series. I was beginning to think that royalty negotiations were going to kill the project, but it looks like it will be finally rolling out. My only reservation concerns the quality of the video. It appears that the masters suffered a bit from age as evidenced by blurring in the title captions and a general fuzziness of picture at times. In the end, I'm just glad to have these to play again. Watching Newhart brings back the best of my memories of the 80s and I can't wait to see more.

Regarding the special features, I thought the cast did a nice job of bringing you into the process. There are nice homages to Mary Frann and Tom Poston too. I just wish they could have gotten more of the cast to contribute. We hear from Larry and the other brother Daryl, but not Daryl, Bob and Stephanie, but that's it.

2213792,4,B0007IO6PA,"The first season in Bob Newhart's second traditional sitcom ""Newhart"" is a hysterical look at a New York couple that buy an old inn in Vermont.  Mr. Newhart stars as Dick Loudon, an extremely successful author of how-to and travel related books.  Some of the early jokes are of the humorous titles of said books.  Some other classic Newhart bits such as his telephone conversations make there way in and as with ""The Bob Newhart Show"", Dick is the center of calm surrounded by a cast of slightly off-center people.  Mary Frann is solid as Dick's understanding wife Joanna and Tom Poston is hilarious as George the inn's handyman who has a few screws of his own that need tightening.  The first season of the series has a different set up than later seasons with Jennifer Nichols as Leslie Vanderkellen, the rich Dartmouth student who takes a job at the inn as a life experience and Stephen Kampmann as Kirk Devane, the owner of the neighboring Minute Man Cafe who is self-absorbed and a chronic liar.  Julia Duffy who would become a perfect foil for Mr. Newhart in future seasons guests a Stephanie Vanderkellen, Leslie's cousin, in one episode and Larry, Darryl & Darryl appear in a few episodes throughout the season.  Ms. Nichols character was written off the show after these season as it was felt that the character didn't provide the kind of weird personality that Mr. Newhart works so well with and was replaced by Ms. Duffy whose self-absorbed drama queen worked much better.  All in all, Newhart is extremely funny and Mr. Newhart will cause you to burst out laughing with just a double take that he so perfectly performs.",1208304000,2,1631,4.71830985915493

The show didn't really take off until the second season but the first season shows a great preview of the classic this would become. Notice the wise use of frequent one sided phone conversations which were Newharts signature. Even though the first season doesn't display the show at its strongest (that would develope as the show grew), there are tons of laughs and not much to complain about. Special Kudos to Tom Poston, maybe the only comedic actor who could stand head to head with Newhart in the ""droll"" department.

I like the feel of the later filming technique. As with any successful ensemble piece, it takes time for some character development, except for Dick (bob Newhart)who can do deadpan dry humor as well as anyone ever could!

Unlike some of the reviewers, I never did like the character of Dirk, and was glad when he was replaced. He was far too overbearing in my opinion. Although Leslie gets replaced by her far funnier and eccentric cousin later on, she was good. The townsfolk, mayor and buddie, Larry, D&D are quite funny and only get better as the series unfolds in later seasons.

2213815,4,B0007IO6PA,"In 1982, Bob Newhart returned to TV with his second sitcom.  In my mind, this show is even better then his first, although it got off to a slow start.

Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart) is the author of multiple how to books and travel guides.  He's always dreamed of restoring an inn.  Together with his wife Joanna (Mary Frann), he decides now is the time.  So they buy the Stratford Inn in Vermont and go about restoring it and turning it into a bed and breakfast.  Along with the inn, they get caretaker George Utley (Tom Poston).  George is a bit dim and simple, but he's truly a lovable guy.  They also hire Leslie Vanderkellen (Jennifer Holmes) as their maid.  Unfortunately, their next door neighbor latches on to them as well.  Kirk Devane (Steven Kampmann) runs the Minutemen Cafe and has the bad habit of lying about everything.

Now those familiar with the show are probably already scratching their heads at some of the cast.  The show was still finding itself in the first couple of seasons, so the characters everyone associates with this sitcom aren't all here yet.  Larry, Darryl, and Darryl do show up for two guest shots (and they are both great) and Leslie's cousin Stephanie (Julia Duffy) does show up for one episode as well.  She's not quite the stuck up snob we'd love starting next season, but it's not a big stretch to see it in her personality.

I can see why the two characters that were replaced were replaced.  It has nothing to do with the actors, everyone on the show is great.  But Kirk gets old in a hurry.  And Leslie, while a wonderful character, isn't that funny.

Having said that, there are some truly great moments here.  The Loudons try to deal with a skeleton in their basement.  Dick is disappointed when he can't get the inn declared a historical landmark.  He has to delicately tell a group of women what their ancestors found when they stayed there during the Revolutionary War (hint, it wasn't a place of good repute).  George meets up with his old girlfriend.  A crowded Christmas gets even worse when a pregnant woman arrives about to give birth.  And Kirk's lies come back to haunt him when his cafe is robbed.

There are three bonus featurettes, two really short, but ""Getting to the Heart of Newhart"" is about 18 minutes and includes interviews with Bob, Julia, and several of the other actors.  The box lists a fourth, but it is no where to be found on the discs.

While the best was still definitely to come from this classic sitcom, there is still plenty here to please fans.  I enjoyed checking into the Stratford and hope the wait isn't to long before I can book another visit.",1205798400,17,2626,4.539445628997868

Of course, Newhart's line delivery is classic.  In addition, ""Kirk"" and ""George"" are both so funny.  I wish that the character of Kirk had been continued--he plays the part so well.  I eagerly await Season 2.  Hope I don't have to wait too long.",1205712000,2,412,4.575342465753424
2213818,5,B0007IO6PA,"This first season of Newhart is much funnier than I remembered it being.  There are a couple of clinkers, but the vast majority of the episodes are very entertaining.  And a few of them are side-splitting.  My favorite is ""The Boy Who Cried Goat,"" which highlights the downside of Kirk's chronic lying, with hilarious results.  Having Kirk take a lie-detector test was a brilliant idea.  Too bad he only lasted two seasons as I thought his character was a scream.  His love interest was Leslie the maid, played by Jennifer Holmes, who didn't seem to contribute much in the way of laughs.  She was, nevertheless, a very likeable personality.  The writers didn't do her any favors, often giving her nondescript lines, a character that wasn't very well defined, and bad clothing.  And they apparently gave up on the love interest plot line with her and Kirk, which made her character irrelevant.

Bob Newhart, of course, was superb, along with Mary Fran and Tom Poston.  Even though this season didn't feature much of Larry, Darryl and Darryl, or Stephanie, and no Michael, it is still a very enjoyable DVD set that I highly recommend.  The video and sound quality are both excellent.

The special features are short, but interesting.  I noticed that no one from the show who was interviewed made any mention of Steven Kampmann (Kirk) or Jennifer Holmes (Leslie).  I thought they deserved some recognition for their work and I don't understand why they were slighted.",1205539200,9,1464,4.870445344129554

Since receiving the Newhart DVD, we cannot stop watching all the episodes!  Each night, we try and watch a couple of them before drifting off to sleep.  The great theme song, and goofball cast delivering laugh after laugh really has been a pleasant surprise to us, as it has allowed us to re-live some great times we shared together in the 1980s.  Each night we look forward to laughing together, and somehow it feels like Bob Newhart and cast are some of our old, long-lost friends.

Of course, as mentioned by many, the show started getting its legs more in Season 2 w/ Stephanie and even more in Season 3 w/ Michael & Stephanie in addition to Larry, Darryl & Darryl owning the Cafe.

Fox needs to realize this aspect so they don't give up on sales too early.  Season 1 of any series is never really the best work.  Look at Seinfeld Season 1 for example.  It's definitely not as good as the rest.

By the way, where are the remaining two seasons of Taxi? Newhart always reminded me of Green Acres. If you enjoy intelligent comedy, this is a great series. I always enjoyed it much more than The Bob Newhart Show, although I'm not exactly sure why.

Tom Poston as George the Handyman was great, and, of course, Bob Newhart is a comedic genious. But, to me, what made this such a standout comedy was the complete ensemble of characters and the writing.

I will be purchasing Season 1 and hoping that the rest of the series is also released. However, if you really think about it, I can seriously see the day coming very soon when we do not purchase any DVD's, but just download the series and then burn the disks.

I really enjoyed Steven Kampmann's character, even though Jennifer Holmes' character was a bit stale.  The first season showcased Kampmann and his acting ability to a T.  To the contrary of most reviews on here, I always found both Julia Duffy and Peter Scolari to be very boring and annoying during the later episodes of this show.

I feel the same way about Newhart, if I can only buy a few seasons I would rather have a few than none.

I am updating my review. I bought the first season of Newhart and while we all know the show gets better in the later seasons, I am so glad I bought season one. I loved hearing the theme music again and seeing the beautiful scenery in the opening credits. Also this was a very funny season. We watched the complete set in three days. I had forgotten that the character of Kirk was actually funny, Tom Poston is great and the locals of Vermont are the same as in future seasons. Larry, Daryl and Daryl make brief, but funny appearances. One episode has Ruth Gordon as Kirk's grandmother who drops in on him with entertaining results. Bob playing golf with the local men. Bob and Joanna's ""friends"" visiting and George's strange night vision...just a few of the funny episodes. There are so many more that others have listed. IMO this set is worth having if they never put out another one. But of course I am waiting anxiously for the next in the series. In the Extra's part...Bob pays tribute to Tom Poston and Mary Frann. He also compares Newhart to the Bob Newhart show. I think anyone who enjoys Bob Newhart and a show the entire family can watch will love Newhart.",1199404800,5,1483,4.3731884057971016

2213841,4,B0007IO6PA,"I am both happy and unhappy to see that the first season of Bob Newhart's second sitcom, ""Newhart"" is going to be released to DVD in February.

I am happy because ""Newhart"" was a very good show with a ""fish out of water"" premise about a writer of ""how-to-do it"" books who decides to run a tourist inn in rural Vermont with his wife.  Like a number of other sitcoms, it took it a while to build up a good head of steam and the first season in general is not as funny as those that followed, but for Newhart fans this DVD set will be well worth having.

The reason I am also UNhappy is because good as it is, ""Newhart"" was not nearly as good as the first Newhart sitcom, ""The Bob Newhart Show.""  And unfortunately, the release of the first season of ""Newhart"" is an almost sure indicator that Fox will not be releasing the last two seasons of TBNS on DVD.

Most of us Newhart fans had already suspected this since it has been well over a year since the release of the 4th season of TBNS.  But there is no way that Fox is going to release sets of TBNS and ""Newhart"" simultaneously as this would reduce the total number of copies sold of the two of them.

It is sad that so many DVD manufacturers have begun releasing the first couple of seasons of some of the classic TV series but have stopped short without completing the full series due to poor sales.  (E.g. Green Acres, Dragnet, Emergency, TBNS, Taxi, etc.)

Do the DVD producers expect that every series is going to have the same number of sales as something like ""The Simpsons?""  Of course, the older classic TV series are going to have fewer sales, fewer of their fans are still around.  But it seems to me that if you issue the first season of ""Green Acres"", say, on DVD and you only sell 20,000 copies of 25,000 produced, for the second season you simply produce 15,000 copies to insure that you sell them all.  This is not brain surgery, folks!

Forgive me.  Getting back to Newhart, if you like a good situation comedy, buy it and pray that Fox release ALL of the seasons.  Can you imagine some episodes of ""Newhart"" being on DVD without the classic final episode, considered by some the greatest final episode in sitcom history, being available as well?",1196726400,65,2213,4.350364963503649
2213842,5,B0007IO6PA,"I remember when ""Newhart"" debuted in the early 80s when I was in high school and I'll have to admit the first few episodes had to grow on me. However, Dick, Joanna, and George really started clicking as funny and memorable characters.  Kirk could be overbearing, but he was written out eventually in favor of a superb performance by Peter Scolari as Michael Harris.  The show's strongest performer, Julia Duffy, as Stephanie would also eventually emerge as a true comic talent to the success of this long-running series.  And, of course, the presence of Larry, Darryl, and Darryl go without saying.

I understand everyone's apprehension about this long-running series being short-circuited, but I believe the ""die hard"" Newhart fans that remember the original show from the 80s can help launch it to a successful sales juggernaut.  I think the one advantage that die hard Newhart fans have is that they have released EVERY possible TV show that has ever debuted (with the possible exception of the Adam West ""Batman"" series from the 60s).  I mean, they have released really lame one or two season shows that have disgraced the television medium in the past few years and they keep putting this trash out for purchase.

A couple of years ago, I wrote to Bob Newhart begging him to get on the DVD release bonanza for the best sitcom ever - Newhart.  I got back a standard reply that Bob really wanted to release ""The Bob Newhart Show"" from the 70s first.  I was really frustrated that ""Newhart"" was not coming to DVD.  The first season of ""Newhart"" was very good, but the true power of this show came in the third and fourth seasons when the characters really began to evolve.  (By this time, Kirk was written out and Leslie thankfully left after the first season, in favor of the awesomely hilarious Stephanie!)  I am confident that we will be able to get all eight seasons of ""Newhart"" released on DVD.

But, if the DVD distribution of the series fails, we have more to blame than Fox.  We need to blame CBS, the original broadcasting station of this fantastic show, because of the licensing restrictions they put on re-broadcasting the show in re-runs.  I remember that Nick-At-Nite ran the re-runs of Newhart in the mid-90s and then the Country Music Television ran it briefly in the early-2000s and then it disappeared completely from all cable channels.  My fear is that a lot of consumers in their late-twenties and early-thirties will not remember this show and I'm sure that Fox will not properly publicize it, so it will be up to the folks who can remember the 80s to lengthen the DVD seasons on distribution to the public.  This happened with the Rod Serling classic horror show, ""Night Gallery"".  Although, Night Gallery ran for three seasons, only Season One has been released on DVD five years ago!  When I wrote to Universal about releasing Season Two and Season Three of Night Gallery, I received a ""rubber stamp"" response that not only had been the sales been slow, but not many people actually remembered the show!

So, I am extremely excited about Season One of Newhart and I am crossing my fingers that we can get the other seven seasons released from the studio!  This is one of the best sitcoms ever produced and Nick-At-Nite and TVLand really need to sit-up and take notice of a true television classic!",1196294400,26,3324,4.726169844020797

I'm one of those who has a fondness for the first couple of seasons, when the humour was at its most intelligent and subtle...not unlike Bob himself, come to think of it.  This DVD release is highly anticipated though I share the pessimism of others that Fox will stick with the series. Inevitably, demand for series TV tends to drop off as additional years are released.  Perhaps more distrubutors should take a cue from Time-Life, who released all seasons of Get Smart in a single package, before rolling out individual seasons.  It allows true fans to collect the full set at a reasonable one-time price and more casual fans to collect only selected seasons.

The show takes a while to find its feet, and Bob's character starts out a bit nastier than the friendly man most of us remember.  In the episode ""The Man With the Golden Wrist"" he humiliates Emily, who has just given him an expensive present, by pointing out how little money she makes; in another, later episode, he flat-out tells her that he wants her to turn down a full-time job so she can have dinner on the table when he comes home.

There are also a few notes that come out odd when you're familiar with the series as a whole - Carol dates both Howard and Jerry, for example, and the pilot episode features Bob and Emily desperate to have a baby, a shock when you're used to seeing them happily child-free.  There are also a lot of peripheral characters that never made it, for good reason - a patient who is a bad Woody Allen rip-off, Love Boat doctor Bernie Koppel as Bob's obnoxious doctor colleague, a couple of stock sitcom neighbors.

If you've seen all the other episodes and want a complete set, then this season is worth ordering - there's plenty of enjoyment to be found amid the problems.  But if you watch this one first, you could be disappointed.",1192665600,9,1341,4.34
2213851,5,B0007IO6PA,"When the series first aired in the early eighties, I started watching the series when they aired it on Monday nights. I was surprised by the original cast players like Jennifer Holmes (Leslie Vanderkellen) and Steven Kampmann (Kirk Devane). Kirk ran the Minuteman Cafe next door to the Stratford Inn. Julia Duffy played Leslie's cousin, Stephanie, in a guest appearance and she returned later as a series regular. The cast included the incomparable Bob Newhart as Dick Loudon (author and new innkeeper from New York City) with Mary Frann as Joanna Loudon (his wife).

The Loudons are new to life in Vermont and inn keeping. Tom Poston played George Utley, the handyman. The first season includes a memorable Christmas episode. Bob Newhart's Dick Loudon is a straight man playing to the craziness in the small town. The first season has a great list of guest stars like Ruth Gordon who played Kirk's grandmother, K Callan, Earl Boen, Dick Christie, Penny Fuller, Alley Mills, Paddi Edwards, Stephen Furst, Rue McClanahan, Dana Elcar, Nancy Lenehan, Daniel J. Travanti, Brandon Maggart, James Avery and Jerry Van Dyke among them.

The DVD series includes 3 DVDs with the entire first season and three special features about the making of the series, the cast, and the fashion styles with regards to it. I enjoyed the tributes to Mary Frann and Tom Poston who passed away prior to the DVD release. Mary Frann died in 1998 at only 55 years old. Tom Poston (George Utley) died at 85 years old  in 2007.

2213858,4,B0007IO6PA,"I was very happy when I saw that one of my all-time favorite sitcoms, ""The Bob Newhart Show"", was finally being released on DVD.  The first season of the show, like most first seasons of shows, spends a lot of time showing the quirks and mannerisms of the main characters on the show.  This is most prevalent in the first few episodes.  One drawback of the season was that out of nowhere the pilot was thrown in as the ninth episode.  Suddenly, Suzanne Pleshette has a different hairstyle, the Hartleys have a different nosy neighbor, the wallpaper in their apartment is different, Emily's friend Margaret is pregnant, and the Hartleys are obsessed with having a baby.  After this episode, everything goes back to the way it was with the same cast and no mention of the Hartleys trying to become parents.  Toward the end of the season, the show had found its groove and it would really hit its stride in the second season. Overall, this DVD set is worth your time and money.  It's not the best season of the show, but it will definitely keep you entertained.",1168387200,6,1058,4.5661375661375665

2213861,3,B0007IO6PA,"Long before today's stand-up comics started to get their own series, Bob Newhart made the move from being a stand-up comic to the main character of his own situation comedy. His success as a stand-up comedian had led to his hosting a variety show in 1961, but hosting a show is not the same as acting and this show from the 1970s led the way to so many comedians making the move. As with all his series, the success of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" comes from the ensemble and the writing.

The first season (1972-1973) is a bit uneven at the start, but the creators and writers tweaked it a bit to get the right feel and by the end of the first season the show had really hit its stride. The difference between the pilot episode and shows like ""The Man with the Golden Wrist"", ""Not with my Sister you don't"", and ""Bum Voyage"" is tremendous. So if you think the show isn't as good as you remembered it when you are watching the shows from the first third of the season, don't worry too much, because it keeps getting better, and the last third of the season is very funny.

There are no extras in this DVD set. There are 24 episodes on 3 DVDs each of which has 4 episodes per side. There are no actor profiles, features, interviews, or anything like that. The sound is mono, and they probably could have done a better job of cleaning up the video. However, despite these issues this is definitely a funny show and for those who like comedy with more thought and less slapstick, this is for you. I can only give this DVD set 3 stars because of the issues I mentioned with the DVD set, and because the show itself gets better in subsequent seasons.",1147564800,45,1639,4.300970873786408

Bob plays a psychologist from Chicago and he's got some pretty funny patients.  Any show with Mr. Carlin or Bob's group sessions is worth watching.  The rest of the cast is his wife, their neighbor, an orthodontist who works in Bob's building and the secretary they share with a few other doctors.  All of them are good, but it's Bob and his patients who really make the show.

It's also fun to laugh at the ridiculous clothes they wore 30 years ago.

There was poor Bob in his super wide ties and butt enhancing double vented sport coats that no one I knew could afford when the show debuted.  Yep, Bob was funny, bumbling, and quite a bit selfish, but, better than that, the show was infested with hysterical characters.  And, how could Carol dress like that if she had even one mirror in her apartment?  No bad words or disgusting situations that are the apparent staples of modern programming.  This is a good thing.  And, the double sided DVDs did not even skip once, although I would still recommend handling them as if they were rare coins.

I was young and I had never seen a rail train before like that one in the music intro of this tv series. I lived in a small town. I like the theme music which is called ""Home To Emily"".
  This tv series was intriguing.  It showed what I thought at the time was how married people are and how they lived.  This was a tv comedy series with a good middle-age cast and ""Bob"" and ""Emily"" never had children of their own. Moosie Drier would come to visit. The writing was superb and intellectual.  You won't hear ghetto insults and curse words here.
  The formula for this tv series worked and unfortunatly today they just do not make tv comedy with middle-age people anymore and that is a real shame.  It is truly the middle-age and seniors that enjoy watching prime-time television, which is why TV LAND network is such a hit.

  Bob Newhart played ""Dr. Robert Hartley"", a psychologist who is married to a well-educated proper woman, ""Emily"" (Suzanne Pleshette). Bob has a new lobby secretary, ""Carol"" (Marcia Wallace) whom at first seems to be a bubble-head, but really becomes an efficent secretary that Bob can not do without.  Carol is also the secretary for the orthodontist, ""Jerry"" (Peter Bonerz).
  Poor Bob.  You never know what Bob has to deal with every morning at work.  It's either the elevator or he has to deal with a fill-in secretary while Carol is away. In any case, Bob certainly needs his morning coffee.

  The rarly-seen pilot episode (the test episode for networks for possible tv series) is really neat-o to see.  The living room is slightly different.  The bedroom decor is different.  The new neighbor is different.  William Redfield played a neighbor, ""Arthur Hoover"", in the test pilot episode. Patricia Smith played his wife, ""Margaret Hoover"" and continued the role to 1973.  William Redfield only made one more appearance, as a different character in the Fourth Season, Episode 18.

2213867,5,B0007IO6PA,"I hadn't seen any episodes of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" in a number of years prior to purchasing this very nice set of DVDs that has been marketed by Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.

I had almost forgotten how good this sitcom was (and still is). It's been fun being able to see these episodes again, and in uncut form, on DVD. Bob Newhart's dry humor and deadpan style create many jocular moments during this 24-episode rookie season of Bob's self-titled CBS television series (which aired during the 1972-1973 TV season). And those one-man telephone conversations that Bob is known for are always good for some chuckles too. There are usually at least two or three of those in each episode.

""The Bob Newhart Show"" began its 6-year, 142-episode-long network-television lifespan on Saturday evening, September 16, 1972, when the first episode (""Fly The Unfriendly Skies"") aired on the Columbia Broadcasting System. When looking back on the impeccable Saturday-night television line-up that CBS possessed in the early 1970s, my mouth pops open with amazement at how good that roster of shows was. As an example, Saturday nights on CBS during the 1973-1974 TV campaign (which was the second season of Newhart's series) featured the following impressive parade of programs:

8:00 PM -- ""All In The Family""

8:30 PM -- ""M*A*S*H""

9:00 PM -- ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""

9:30 PM -- ""The Bob Newhart Show""

10:00 PM -- ""The Carol Burnett Show""

No wonder Saturdays were big for CBS during that era. What a fabulous line-up indeed. Prior to confirming the above CBS prime-time program schedule, I had thought that the long-running ""M*A*S*H"" had always been part of the Saturday-night schedule. But, in fact, it was only during that one season (1973-1974) that the show appeared on Saturdays. For the remainder of its prime-time run, ""M*A*S*H"" aired on either Sundays, Tuesdays, or Fridays.

During Bob Newhart's very first season ('72-'73), the CBS Saturday lineup featured three-fifths of the same programming as the '73-'74 season, with the differences in the schedule being ""Bridget Loves Bernie"" (at 8:30 PM) and ""Mission: Impossible"" in the 10:00 time slot.

There's nothing overly fancy about this 3-Disc Bob Newhart DVD boxed set from 20th Century Fox, but it certainly gets the job done very nicely anyway (in a low-key, no-frills manner).

These early-'70s episodes look just fine through my orbs. I have no complaints about these DVD transfers at all. This TV show was photographed on film and in color; and the colors look pretty good and natural on the DVDs. Perhaps each show isn't absolutely blemish-free, but still very nice overall.

Even if these DVD prints were glazed over with a coating of sand and shrouded in fog, I'd probably still enjoy watching them, because of the singular on-screen presence of one Suzanne Pleshette. Suzanne, who was age 35 and 36 when these episodes first aired in '72 and '73 (and she's looking mahhhh-velous!), has that certain 'something' that I've always enjoyed watching. I love her in everything she's done -- from her excellent dramatic roles in the 1960s TV series ""The Fugitive"", to her first-rate portrayal of an ill-fated schoolteacher in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" in 1963, to her part as the smart, funny, and always-feisty ""Emily Hartley"" on ""The Bob Newhart Show"".

I should also mention Suzanne's appearance opposite Michael Rennie's ""Harry Lime"" in an episode of the TV series ""The Third Man"". That episode in question, called ""Listen For The Sound Of A Witch"", was filmed in 1959. A darn good ep. too, featuring a stunning 22-year-old brunette actress named ""Suzanne"".

Suzanne Trivia ..... Did you know that Suzanne Pleshette very nearly became ""Catwoman"" in the ""Batman"" TV series of the 1960s? (I'd have loved her in that show, I'm sure....and in that ""Cat"" outfit, too.) ~wink~

This Bob Newhart DVD collection comes packed in a fairly-rugged cardboard box, which comfortably holds two slim-style plastic cases. The trim disc-holding cases that were included with the DVD set that I received from Amazon are black in color (there's no need for the clear, transparent ones here, since there's no text or artwork on the reverse side of the removable paper inserts that wrap around the cases). The first two double-sided discs fit inside the first case, while Disc 3 goes solo into the other one. A brief episode description for each of the shows, plus original CBS air dates, can be found on the back side of each of the two plastic cases.

There are no DVD bonus items included here, unless you want to count a foreign-language soundtrack and subtitling as ""bonus"" material. This set does indeed have a non-English audio option -- there's a Spanish Dolby Digital track available for each episode (of the 2-channel Mono variety; I enjoy hearing the voice of the very beautiful Suzanne Pleshette being dubbed in Spanish), in addition to the very adequate English DD 2.0 Mono audio. Both English and Spanish subtitles can be toggled on and off as well. Video, as you would expect, comes in the native Full-Frame TV ratio of 1.33:1.

The non-animated DVD Menus employed for this first-season Bob Newhart set are simplistic and will quickly get you to where you want to be. The episodes are divided up into several individual chapters (9 chapter breaks per show, with a ""Scene Selection"" Menu option available for all episodes), with a chapter stop inserted immediately after the opening titles, which is always a good idea in my opinion.

Fox's ""The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete Second Season"" 3-Disc DVD collection is pretty much identical in layout and style to this first-season product, and is also energetically recommended by this reviewer. Any Bob Newhart buff will want to collect all seasons of ""Dr. Hartley's"" series.

Plus, these seasonal boxed sets of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" look right at home on the ever-growing ""TV-on-DVD"" shelf, especially when nestled right up against all of the excellent full-season DVD collections of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". Those two first-class sitcoms, which both fall under the ""MTM Enterprises"" umbrella, are required viewing for any self-respecting devotee of top-notch 1970s-era television programming.",1131235200,13,6221,5.0576171875
2213868,5,B0007IO6PA,"It's been great fun seeing Bob again on DVD.  The show took most of the first season to find its footing before becoming a mainstay on television. Bob's dry humor contrasted sharply to his zany supporting cast.  In these episodes, Bob shuffled through many ""patients"" before settling on a steady group that would predominate in later seasons, with Carlin emerging as the most memorable.  These episodes also show the domestic side of Bob with some funny but also very true-to-life situations between he and Emily.  Their argument over Monday Night Football being the most memorable.  Suzanne Pleshette really found her voice in Emily, holding her own against Bob.",1126051200,12,663,5.101851851851852

All the characters are wonderful, with their quirky personalities, and no one has a face like Bob Newhart for evoking laughter, just by his reactions.  I was surprised how many of the lines came back to me after all these years.",1125273600,7,401,4.306666666666667

2213873,4,B0007IO6PA,"The 70's brought a lot of classic sit-coms.  Among them is this one, the first to star Bob Newhart.

In this show, he stars as Dr. Bob Hartley, a psychologist with a successful practice in Chicago.  He has a mostly happy home life with his wife Emily, a teacher.  There's also their neighbor Howard, a navigator for an airline.  At the office, Bob must not only deal with his patients, but also secretary Carol and best friend Jerry, an orthodontist.

Of course, the best part of the show is Bob's reactions to the situation around him.  He's the master of sarcasm and facial expressions.  He can get more laughs with a look then any comedians I've seen.

On the down side, like many shows, this one is still developing.  This is most obvious by throwing the pilot in as the ninth episode.  I had a hard time figuring out what Emily teaches for sure.  Some episodes she's a sub, some she has a regular class.  And there's the sad case of Margaret, a neighbor who vanished half way through the season.

This set will delight fans of the series.  All 24 episodes are compiled on three double-sided DVD's.  With only four episodes per side, they look and sound sharp, even if the sound is only mono.  Unfortunately, there aren't any extras, but that looks like it will change with the next season release.

I'll admit to being a bigger fan of Newhart then of this show.  Even so, I can't help but find this show charming and funny.",1122422400,3,1428,4.465116279069767

2213876,5,B0007IO6PA,"The Bob Newhart Show was one of the great 70s sitcom and it has finally been released on DVD.  The show followed Dr. Robert Hartley, a pyschologist living in Chicago with his wife and substitute schoolteacher, Emily.  We meet Bob's nosy yet lovable neighbor Howard Borden, his best friend Jerry Robinson, an orthadontist who works on the same floor, and Bob's lovesick receptionist, Carol Kester.  Included with the main cast are recurring guest stars like Jack Riley as Mr. Carlin and John Fielder as Mr. Peterson, two of Bob's most hilarious patients.  This ensemble cast provided plenty of hilarious moments, including the ""Hi, Bob,"" drinking game, and it is great to see this show finally on DVD.  This sitcom provided Bob Newhart the perfect opportunity for his dry, sarcastic humor.  As well, almost every show from the first season features one of his famous telephone acts.  For a can't miss 70s sitcom, check out the Bob Newhart show.

  Bob Newhart is hilarious throughout as Dr. Robert Hartley, a pyschologist living in Chicago with his wife Emily, played by Suzanne Pleshette.  Together, Newhart and Pleshette make a funny and still believable married couple.  Bill Daily as neighbor Howard Borden, Peter Bonerz as orthadontist/best friend Jerry Robinson, and Marcia Wallace as receptionist Carol Kester make up the supporting cast and provide some of the show's most hilarious moments.  The First Season DVD features all 24 episodes in full frame on three discs.  They look cleaned up from some of the ones shown on TV.  There are no extras included on the DVD, but hopefully on future releases bloopers/gag reel or interviews with the cast are included.  For now, we'll just have to enjoy the classic first season of The Bob Newhart Show.  Highly recommended.",1120176000,8,1773,5.017123287671233

I guess this basically means, you didn't have to be a fan of it when it was in primetime to enjoy it. I like the packaging of the DVD, its pretty simple with nice graphics. The menus are rather plain, but that just makes it easier to jump right to the shows, instead of wating for some super fancy 3d menus to load. The colors of the video are not very vibrant, but this is of course due to the direct tranfer from the original to DVD. Obviously there was no enhacements done. The sound is original too, just mono. The no-frills presentation of the DVD is just fine, because the quality of the show is awesome.

Its one of the funniest TV shows that I have ever seen. It ranks up there with the Honeymooners, Seinfeld, and the odd couple. The writing is brilliant, the acting is superb (except for a couple of guest stars). I definately reccomend this DVD set, even if you aren't into old TV.",1119916800,10,1070,4.095238095238095

Just posted a review for ""Taxi"" season two and both of these shows are so funny that it makes me wonder why shows currently in prime time can't be as good.  Okay, so ""Friends"" and ""Raymond"" were great, but I can't think of any others that live up to the quality of this stuff.

And if it weren't for Nick@Nite (happy 20th anniversary!) I probably never would've seen ""The Bob Newhart Show"" at all.  Doesn't ANY station or network anywhere still replay these??  Well, their loss if not.  But thank goodness Fox is smart enough to unlock the old vaults and let the public re-experience this stuff.  Witty stuff and so worth the low-low-LOW price!  Less than half of what my roommate paid for that ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" set (Sorry Dale!).

;-P

The only thing not so good about this first season collection is the color is kind of weak.  Thought it was my TV settings but checked it out and nope... it's the discs.  After reading that a few others here noticed the same problem I don't feel so bad.  But come, Fox!  I know you're making a bundle on these discs so you gotta work on that for seasons two to six.

Last night a bunch of us popped in a disc and played the HI BOB! drinking game.  Got smashed before flipping it over to play side two.  YOU GOTTA TRY IT!

2213880,5,B0007IO6PA,"I can honestly say that I have never seen another show or sitcom quite like this one.  Bob Newhart has that soft spoken and subtle humor, similar to other great comedians like Jack Benny.  He doesn't need to use slap stick to get you laughing.  Whoever had the idea of centering the show around a mild mannered psychologist, his patients, his friends and his family was a genius!  The ensemble cast was just great.  After a few shows you really begin to like Jerry the Dentist, Carol the Secretary, Howard the Neighbor, and of course Emily the Wife.  The chemistry between Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) and Bob (Bob Newhart) was so good it almost seemed as though they were married for real.  They argued, bickered and had misunderstandings just like normal couples do.  Still the affection and love they had for eachother always came through. I have to admit that as a kid I used to think that if plain old Bob could end up with an attractive and nice lady like Emily than there was hope for me.

I should also mention how fun Bob's patients were.  I'm sure most psychologists don't have such loveable patients.  I'm sure most psychologists don't have their patients over to their home for Christmas either.  Still these were some of the nice things about the show.  Bob was just a nice guy.  If I ever need therapy I hope to get a shrink like Bob. Bob always seems to be on the job.  He's usually tyring to sort out the emotional troubles of friends, family, co-workers and patients in each show.

There are no DVD extras but that's not a surprise considering how the first season release of THE MARY TYLER MOORE show turned out.  They pulled all the stops out for that release, interviews and commentaries.  The initial release price was over $40 and I guess not as many people purchased it as the studio thought would.  The elevated price turned off prospective purchasers.  So now, as with THE BOB NEWHART SHOW, the sudios release the DVD's with no extras but the price is under $30.  I hope that strategy does the trick because I can't wait for the remaining three seasons to be released.",1117756800,8,2090,4.564516129032258

After 30 years, it's still a great show and I hope Season #2 (along with the rest) will be released soon!  Thanks, Bob!  You're a great comedian and deserved an Emmy Award in my opinion :-)",1117497600,4,326,4.209677419354839
2213882,5,B0007IO6PA,"Most T.V. viewers already know the Bob Newhart show from the number of times it's been syndicated. If you haven't seen it recently, now is the time to give it another look and see comedy which was driven by good writing rather than by overused and/or hackneyed sitcom plots. It's also a pleasure to see humor which isn't nasty or negative. The Bob Newhart show is downright ""fresh"" when viewed alongside current comedy fare.

As for the complaints about the packaging and lack of extras, one has to consider the *extremely* low price for the season and the experience Fox had with the Mary Tyler Moore show (another classic of the same era). Fox gave the first season of the Mary Tyler Moore show the star treatment and a higher price to cover the cost and it sold poorly. This made them reluctant to even release other classic comedies and the Bob Newhart show may never have seen a DVD release.

While I would have liked to have seen an interview with Bob offering some memories of  his experience with the show (or introductions), I think this type of comedy doesn't benefit much from commentary since the humor is in the pacing and the dialog. Talking over the show would seem rather disruptive and pointless. Also, I'm not sure how much anyone could remember from a show that aired so long ago.

As for the packaging, I like the slim cases and wish all DVDs were released in them. The thicker cases just take up more space on your shelves. Besides, it's what is on the discs that really matters and this show's humor has aged very gracefully. It's a delight to watch again.",1116460800,6,1578,4.545774647887324
2213883,5,B0007IO6PA,"I'm so glad Fox came out with this set. The Bob Newhart Show is funny, sophisticated, clever, and a great example of top-notch sitcom writing. Bob Newhart, as usual, underplays his role perfectly, and is supported by a full cast of ace standup and screen comedians that have become sitcom legends.

Many of the best episodes are here in the first season. Also significant is that the film transfer looks substantially better than what has been on TV for years, and the episodes are full-length instead of truncated synidicated cuts. My only complaint is that the menus are a little hokey.

But overall, a great set for a very small price. If you enjoy shows like TAXI, Barney Miller, The Odd Couple, or Cheers, you will really enjoy this set. And if you're already a Bob Newhart Show fan, this is a no-brainer purchase. Buy it.",1115251200,7,827,4.657534246575342

The packaging is poor (two slimline cases, with double sided DVD's????), the extras are non-existent (none, nada, nyet!), and the transfers are equal to VHS quality, full of grain and poor focus.

But, of course, this show will probably only see one release, so those who appreciate quality entertainment are stuck with what they give us.

I can only hope future releases of this show (and MTM) will be treated with greater respect....but I'm not holding my breath.",1114819200,31,686,4.846153846153846
2213886,3,B0007IO6PA,"Don't get me wrong, Bob Newhart is great as a deadpan comedy actor.  His telephone conversations where you only hear his side are classics of the genre.  The problem is that the cast around him and the writing are not up to the standards of my favorite series such as ""The Odd Couple"", ""Barney Miller"" and ""Taxi"".  Actually, Taxi and Bob Newhart parallel each other, except that Taxi has a working class venue whereas that of Newhart is upper-middle class.  However, as much as Bob is superior to Judd Hirsch as a comedy actor, the supporting cast of Taxi was much better.  At least in the first season, Bob's psychology patients had pleny of potential for major laughs, especially Mr Elliot Carlin (played by the even more deadpan

Jack Riley), they just weren't utilised.  Instead we are given endless stories about the unfulfilled love lives of Jerry and Carol which gets stale after awhile.  I also find Suzanne Pleshette as Bob's wife Emily to be very bland and not a good spouse for Bob to play off (someone more neurotic would have been funnier).

One thing I observed by wathing all the episodes is the fact that Bob has a noticeable stutter! Either this is done on purpose for the role, otherwise I am surprised it didn't hurt his career.

In spite of my criticism, the show is entertaining.  I hope that later seasons will be brought out on DVD because often (as in the case of Barney Miller), the shows take time to hit their stride and so Bob might get better as well!",1114732800,6,1480,4.547169811320755

But the package is really a disappointment.  Poor graphics and no added content.  It was supposed to have the unaired pilot (Jerry is a shrink in practice with Bob!), but that didn't happen.  And they should have added the last Newhart, the best series finale in history, where Bob wakes up in the old bedroom and proclaims the whole Newhart show just a weird dream!  Maybe next time.",1114646400,5,539,4.459183673469388
2213888,5,B0007IO6PA,"The Bob Newhart Show is a piece of the wonderful puzzle of early 70's sitcoms that made the time a wonderfully laughing matter. From Mary Richard's time spent at WGM, to Felix and Oscar's stint as roommates, the Bob Newhart Show fit in like a kid glove. We spent many a 1/2 hour watching Bob walk home from the office to his beloved Emily (according to Newhart, the craziest walk home ever, based on Chicago geography).

Bob Newhart brings his unique stlye of comedy to television in this show. Bob plays a psychologist with a crazy set of co-workers, and an equally crazy set of neighbors at home. Bob is the brilliant center of the show, intelligent, but not afraid to be the end of jokes that work well in the show. His wife Emily is a schoolteacher, however, through the season she appears to change jobs from substitute to school board worker. Often, whatever her job is depends on the needs of her in that episode's plot.  Wacky neighbor Howard Borden is set up early on as being somewhat not there. In the office, Bob's best friend is Jerry, a definitely 70's singles man who is a brillliant counterpart to the office secretary, Carol.

This collection is sadly without any extras. Since all of the actors who starred in the show are still alive, it's amazing to me there isn't any bonus features. It almost seems as if this collection was rushed to the stores to sell, as the quality isn't as high as other DVD TV show collections (I Love Lucy setting a very high standard).

Still, the negatives don't detract from the wonderful enjoyment of this show. The laughs are hearty. Watching this, I'm drawn back to my childhood, and the nights I spent watching Bob and Emily puzzle out their life problems, and the problems of their friends, in Chicago. And the result is an enjoyable ride indeed.",1114473600,6,1800,4.580745341614906

2213893,4,B0007IO6PA,"Having my 3 star review booed out of town, and now having actually watched the entire first two discs, I can safely say this was not only a good series but a soon to be great series and worthy of a small rewrite. It took a handful of episodes for the characters to endear themsleves to me, meaning the whole cast but now... I'm addicted. Although, you've got to admit a few of gags are standard 70's cornball stuff (many by the neighbor, ""Margret""), but above all else is great writing and timing. Some true standout episodes that won me over totally and prompted a slight change of heart were: Anything Happen While I Was Gone?, His Busiest Season, and Let's Get Away From It Almost.

You know a show is good when the star can entertain you merely by talking on a phone (probably) to no one at all. Bob's facial expressions, timing, and body language speak volumes.

The transfer is pretty nice, the sound is passable. The packaging seems a bit ""cut rate"" but is servicable I suppose, I've definately seen worse. I still say there is much work that could be done with the updating of sound and picture but I suppose I'd rather have this than nothing.

Bring on Season 2! And you and I both know the problem with this: We will burn through Season One in a week and a half and then have to wait six months for Season Two.

PS, why does the Amazon description say Bill Daily was in Bewitched? Talk about not knowing your classic television 101's.",1113782400,7,1444,4.397003745318352
2213894,4,B0007IO6PA,"I've always liked the Bob Newhart Show, and thought it was a shame that it's been hard to catch in reruns for the past 20 years or so.  TV Land seemed to be playing Musical Bobs by repeatedly putting it on the schedule for a few weeks -- always in the early morning hours -- only to quickly yank it off the air again.  Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Still, I was surprised to find how many times I laughed out loud while watching the episodes in this first season.  And this wasn't even Bob's best season!  The show was still finding its footing at this point, but it's still hilarious.

The show itself is definitely worthy of five stars, but since there doesn't seem to have been any restoration work done (the video and audio quality is mediocre at best), the rating is brought down to four stars (I would make it 4 1/2 if that were an option).  However, the fact that very little money was spent putting these episodes on DVD is what enables us to buy the entire first season for such a terrific price.  Compare the price of this set to the first season set of The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  That one came out a few years ago, beautifully restored and chockful of extras, but with an MSRP of fifty bucks!  No wonder they didn't sell all that many (though I was one of the few who happily purchased the set, being a longtime devotee of the show).  Additional seasons were promised, but guess what?  So few sets were sold that they cancelled any further releases of MTM.  If keeping the Bob Newhart Show down to the bare bones enables them to release all of the seasons at a terrific price, it's okay with me.

The Bottom Line: An hilarious show, uncut for the first time since it went into syndicated reruns, for a fantastic price.  Highly recommended.",1113782400,13,1747,4.375776397515528

2213898,5,B0007IO6PA,"The CBS lineup of the mid 1970's was a true juggernaut with ""All in the Family"", ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and the most underrated and probably least appreciated, ""The Bob Newhart Show"".  Now I was still a bit young at the time but through seeing repeats for years I've gained a great appreciation for this show.  So cleverly written, so undeniably witty that it took, I think, a bit more maturity on my part to fully ""get it"".  You start with a great cast.  Toss out Newhart who was always great, and move to the co-stars.  Suzanne Pleshette as bob's wife Emily, a school teacher, Bill Daily as Next door neighbor and Airlines Pilot, Howard, Peter Bonerz as Dr. Jerry Robinson who shared receptionist Carol played by Marcia Wallace.  And then there was Bob's various patients, most notably John Fielder as ""Mr. Peterson"" and Jack Riley as ""Mr. Carlin"".

Bob's casual nature in dealing with his nutty patients week after week has always been the highlight for me.  I've always loved shows where you kind of have one normal character surrounded by a cast of looneys and no show ever did it better than this one.  Surprisingly, this show was NEVER a top 10 show.  Incredible really considering it's strong lead-ins with MTM and ""All in the Family"".

This set obviously collects the entire first season, all 24 episodes and, If I may say, at one heck of a bargain compared to many other TV shows on DVD.  A few of my favorite episodes from season one are:

""His Busiest Season""  It's Christmas and Bob's patients are feeling even more down in the dumps than usual so Bob decides to invite them over for Christmas.

""I owe it all to you, But not that much""  Jerry, whose problems with women were a recurring theme, decides to see Bob as a patient to talk about it but soon it threatens their friendship.

""Don't go to Bed Mad""  Bob and Emily get into a huge argument when Bob wants to watch Monday Night Football.

8047591,1,B0007IO6PA,"I hated the Joanna script then.  I hate it now.  Johanna had it right when, as in the episode, 'You're Homebody 'til Somebody Loves You/, when she tells Dick that she thinks the only reason he wanted the inn was to be able to walk through it, and say that he loves the place.  Meanwhile, she functions doing everything, including the bookkeeping, and restoration work.  The trigger was Dick calling Joanna a ""homebody,"" during an interview. Even the title is a slur on women.  (Nothing wrong with BEING a homebody, but Joanna certainly isn't). This show was created in the 1980s.  There is no excuse for writing the female lead as worthless, except for window dressing.  But the same is true of 'Emily' in the Bob Newhart Show.  Gagged me then - gagged me now.  If you remove the female characters from either of these shows, it would have been better than to perpetuate the belief that women don't need, and won't take ""real"" jobs, or have a thought in their heads other than to have a maaa--n.

The 'homebody' episode has Joanna, not standing up for herself, but seeking employment and then quitting before she starts, because she really just wants to be with 'Dick' and keep him and guests happy.  This, even though she quit her studies in order to support Dick when he began his writing career.  How many women were refused work because their potential bosses were sure they weren't serious about work, and would just be working for 'pin-money' - or would quit, or be absent the second their husband or child became ill.  The answer is - hundreds of thousands, although no one worried about that during WWII.  I know countless women who were turned down for work because, even if they were single, and not living with anyone, (as very few did, even by the 1980s, employers were certain that the women would quit as soon as a man appeared in their lives.  In 'Newhart', slow, dull, incompetent 'George' still gets housed and fed.  That wouldn't happen to a woman.

'Emily' in the Bob Newhart Show is the same deal, but, perhaps, worse, because she inflicts her warped view of being a woman on the children whose 3rd grade minds she influences, the few times she has a substitute teaching job.  Otherwise, a screwdriver would have to be explained to her.

What is astounding is that MTM Productions produced these shows even as ""Mary Tyler Moore"" productions, advanced the 'Mary Tyler Moore' show, 'Rhoda', et al.  Why did Moore allow these females-as-idiot portrayals in the 'Newhart' shows  She probably even watched Miss Frances in 'Ding Dong School' - or Margaret Rutherford as Jane Marple.  Or listened to Marlo Thomas' 'Free To Be You and Me'.
