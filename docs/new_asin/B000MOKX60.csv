  Rita Tushingham plays a timid ugly duckling type who writes childrens books and wants a child of her own. She wants to find a Prince Charming, so she leaves mum at home and heads to the big city. She comes across her prince accidentally. Rita sees him walking his dog when it runs off and disappears into the night. Rita takes the canine home thinking she will return the animal to its owner and set the stage for a romantic introduction. The wallflower returns the animal after she grooms it and places a ribbon in the dogs hair. The appreciative prince stuns Rita when he asks her if she is willing to move in with him. The stranger suggests he will help her out in the baby department if she agrees to live in his brownstone and clean up after him. But Rita is soon dismayed. She finds that weeks of cleaning do not result in the romantic interlude she badly wants. In the meantime, she discovers a drawer full of money, another one stuffed with womens jewelry, not to mention that a utility knife is left out in the open. It seems her prince has a couple of problems, not least of which is the fact he is a serial killer and shes next on the list!",1382745600,,1246,4.285106382978723
