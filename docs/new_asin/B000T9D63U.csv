8208242,5,B000T9D63U,"I am elated to finally have a pilates workout geared for men! And bonus that the guy doing the exercises is near my +50 age group. That inspires me. I like Anna Caban's pilates videos just fine, but I've never aspired to look quite like her. And I've never had quite the flexibility to do the exercises quite the way she, or the other former professional dancers do. To make this a more male oriented workout, they add 3lb weighted balls, and work a little more on upper body strength. And personally, I just use 5lb dumbbells, not the balls. The only thing I didn't like was doing the 100 with weights and bent legs. I feel like I work the lower abs better with the traditional 100. Thank you, Moira Merrithew and John Garey.",1506988800,,726,4.385185185185185
8208243,4,B000T9D63U,"This is pretty good.  As others have mentioned, there isn't too much different about it than, say, a regular STOTT Pilates workout, except for the addition of the 3 lb toning balls.  Make sure that you have these, as you would be highly disappointed otherwise; dumbbells would just not be the same, either, due to how you have to hold and roll them on the ground.",1421107200,,363,4.484848484848484

8208245,3,B000T9D63U,"Although some of the exercises were modified for men - ""the hundred"" with hand weights - the overall video content was basic. Some of the standard ""beginning Pilates"" videos posed a greater challenge than this one.",1294444800,5,214,4.972222222222222
8208246,5,B000T9D63U,"An excellent workout in every way.  A great way to start or finish the day.  You feel strong and tall.  If 3 pound balls start to feel light, get heavier ones.  I am using 6 pounds in each hand and it REALLY makes a difference.  Perfect workout for strength, agility, and great posture.",1265414400,6,286,4.320754716981132
8208247,5,B000T9D63U,"I shopped around for a decent Pilates DVD to use in a home workout routine.  I looked at all of the ones here on Amazon and decided on Stott Pilates:  Pilates for Men.  I'm not the most flexible person, or at least I wasn't before the video, so getting a Pilates workout for guys was key.
When I first saw this DVD and read the description, I was impressed.  I felt like I was working one on one with the instructor, who does a great job.  I plan on buying more of her videos.
I'm becoming addicted to pilates and felt the difference in my body after the first workout.
The only thing I would caution you about this video, is that it requires you have two 3 pound toning balls.  I didn't know that until I got the video.",1212537600,34,720,4.107142857142857
