This one fits the bill, and I watched it on a windy, stormy night, no less.  Lugosi with a whip, a dwarf, a cretin, and a creepy housekeeper; Elizabeth Russel, dear to our old horror movie fan hearts as Val Lewton's muse; disappearing brides; secret passageways; vampirish doings; a stalwart doctor hero and an intrepid and spunky girl reporter.  This one covers more than its share of B movie bases in a scant hour, not to mention the most coffins I think I've ever seen in one film.",1480377600,,734,4.4222222222222225
1783893,2,B00006L90U,"The Corpse Vanishes, 1942  film

The film begins with a church wedding. The bride faints; a doctor declares her dead! A black car takes the body away. Then the men from the morgue show up for the body. Who kidnapped another corpse? The police search only finds a hired man who knows nothing. There will be a society wedding. What can go wrong? The bride gets an unusual orchid as a gift. Poor Alice faints, her body is removed. Does the orchid have a strange smell? Miss Hunter discovers the connection btween the dead brides. We learn why the bodies are taken - for an extract that is given to the Countess! The people at the railroad station say Dr. Lorentz is strange and spooky. Who sent that coffin to Dr. Lorentz?

Reporter Hunter gets a ride to the Lorentz home with Dr. Foster. She wants information on the rare Stanhopia orchid. It is a dark and stormy night, so they will spend the night as guests. Will there be a frightful event in the night? Some horrible creature? Was it just a nightmare? Who would sleep in a coffin? Will something creepy happen? The background music telegraphs the action. Was it all a dream? Do reporters become cynical from working on a newspaper? Dr. Foster visits the newspaper to confirm Patricia Hunter's story. They plan a ruse to catch Dr. Lorentz. Will it work as planned? Will the police shoot first and ask questions later? Can the clever plan of Dr. Lorentz fail? Will bodies pile up to provide an ending?

Is this the worst horror film with Bela Lugosi as a villain? You can see the tight editing and low budget for this Monogram film. Higher production values would have made a better film of this story, which is a variation on the vampire legend but without the supernatural events. Could they ever use body parts for living persons? That reference to ""new tires"" is a joke about wartime rationing. Gasoline rationing also controlled travel.",1477094400,,1891,4.602373887240356

This is a variation on a standard horror/sci-fi plot; women requiring a substance of some sort to keep themselves alive and/or beautiful, or both.  To that end, they require unwilling donors.  In this case, it's so much easier to have them docile at the get-go than flopping around on some gurney in protest!  Yes, Bela is saddled with a shrill shrew of a wife, always whining, constantly demanding, keep me young and alive, in whatever order you prefer, as long as it's young, beautiful, and definitely alive!  He happily complies, kidnapping and collecting brides by the bin full.  Fortunately, he has a grand house with plenty of secret passages, a storage facility, and a lab.  And everything would have been perfect if not for a pesky reporter (Luana Walters as Patricia Hunter) and a physician (Tristram Coffin) who unwittingly helps the mad scientist in his endeavors (until he comes to his senses).

What's not to love?  Crazy story, daffy premise, wacky assistants, and dimwitted police.  It's fabulous.  Okay, yes, it's stupid too...............but still great fun!",1430697600,,1260,5.058252427184466

1783928,2,B00006L90U,"""The Corpse Vanishes"" is definitely not a good film. The plot, the script, the acting -- all ridiculous. Some may say it's so bad, that it's good. But, in my opinion, the film is best viewed as a comedy (even though that was not its intent). I give it two stars only because it can be used (easily) as a great example of a really bad ""horror"" film that is so ridiculous that you want to show it to someone else so they can see how ridiculous it is. Unbelievable that this actually got made. So, it is kind of interesting to see all the cliches, put on film, and intended as a scary movie.  Mel Brooks probably took some of his comedy from this film in his send-up  horror film ""Young Frankenstein"", but his was intended as a comedy. Watch this film as an educational exercise only.",1404691200,,781,4.27027027027027
1783929,3,B00006L90U,"A series of young society brides die at the altar. If this isn't sensational enough, those brides' bodies are stolen on the way to the morgue!

One plucky society columnist discovers the linking clue between the murders/snatches--each bride was wearing a special orchid with a strange, sickly-sweet smell. Her editor, figuring the clue is a red herring, gives her the go-ahead to investigate. She goes to visit a horticultural expert in the country. The horticulturalist is played by Bela Lugosi, so you know that's bad news for her. His house is full of creepy people who ham it up in their performances. Horror ensues.

Lugosi is good but not at his best (like White Zombie and Dracula). Luana Walters also does a good job as the reporter but the other regular characters are a bit flat both in their performing and in the writing. This is a typical B-movie horror film from the 1930s and 1940s, diverting but not riveting.

I won't give too much away here, but one of my favorite parts is when he leaves a son behind. The mother of the two idiot helpers asks why have you done this to my son. He then takes a glove and slaps her in the face and says e""nough, we have work to do!"" This of course is to inject the wife with some more spinal fluid from some pretty gal. Maybe our heroin?

1783937,2,B00006L90U,"Bela Lugosi reached the high water mark of his film career in the 1930s; by the 1940s, however, his career was in freefall, and while there would be a handful of memorable films left to him, they were very few and very far between between. A 1942 Monogram production, THE CORPSE VANISHES wasn't the worst film Lugosi ever made, but it came close enough.

The story, such as it is, concerns a series of brides who seem to drop dead during their weddings--and to make matters worse, their bodies are stolen shortly thereafter. The police are baffled, but intrepid girl reporter Pat Hunter (Luana Walters) discovers that all the brides wore a strangely scented orchid corsage. Pat tracks the orchid to horticuluralist and mad scientist Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi), who is snatching up the brides to drain them of bodily fluids need by his decaying wife (Elizabeth Russell.) Although the brides seem dead, they are actually kept alive in suspended animation until they are drained dry. With the aid of Dr. Foster (Tris Coffin), Pat decides to stage a wedding that will lure Dr. Lorenz to his doom. Unfortunately, the whole thing takes takes sixty-four minutes to do, and by the time the credits roll you'd swear it had actually taken one hundred ninety-two.

Lugosi, as usual, gives the whole thing one hundred ten percent, and it is always a pleasure to see Elizabeth Russell, an actress who is particularly associated with Val Lewton and such films as CAT PEOPLE. In truth, the major players aren't at all bad. They just don't have anything to work with in terms of plot or script. Is it any wonder that the infamous Mystery Science Theatre 3000 took on this particular title? None at all! Hardcore Lugosi and Russell fans will want to see THE CORPSE VANISHES, but all others are warned away!

Angelo is one of the only interesting elements of this dismally schlocky shocker about a madman who kills altar-bound  brides with poison-laced corsages. It stars Bela Lugosi as Dr. Lorenz, the 'bad' doctor who lays 'em out then extracts gland juice from cooling connubial corpses so he can restore his elderly wife's beauty. A decent ensemble whose talents are wasted along with Bela's includes Luana Walters, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal, Joan Barclay and in an uncredited wedding usher cameo, Lou Costello's older brother, Pat.

1783951,4,B00006L90U,"I admit a fondness for this film having seen it countless times on tv in the early 1960's. Back then FAMOUS MONSTERS was THE magazine and Bela WAS Bela! I'm really glad that I was a part of such things, and so, hold this B-movie favorite on the HORROR/CAMP? pedistal.
The plot?...Bela with help from dwarf Angelo Rossito capture would-be dead brides-to-be in order to extract fluids from them to keep his aging wife alive.
The cost of the ALPHA dvd is minimal and the overall quality is quite acceptible, at least as good as I can ever remember it being on tv.
This one is probably my personal Bela Lugosi favorite from his 1940's poverty row era, but don't let that influence your choice.
Great low budget stuff here, played for gruesome horrors yet maintaining a sense of dry humor. Bela's off-kilter clan is kinda like the Adams Family without the jokes, yet comical in an insane way.

1783952,4,B00006L90U,"After starring in ""Dracula"" (1931) one of the first major horror films of the sound era, Bela Lugosi's career should have kept going higher and higher. Instead, the talented actor found himself struggling to stay afloat and maintain credibility in a series of hokey productions from 'poverty row' studio, Monogram Pictures. The movies Lugosi made during this career lowpoint came to be known as ""The Monogram 9"".

THE CORPSE VANISHES (1942) is generally regarded as quite possibly the best from Lugosi's stay at the studio. Luana Walters stars as intrepid reporter Pat Hunter, out to solve the case of the missing brides. All over the city, brides have been dropping dead at the altar, and their bodies mysteriously taken from the morgue. Discovering that each ill-fated bride was wearing a rare scented orchid at the time of her death, Pat's search leads to the upstate mansion belonging to Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). After spending a very spooky night at the Lorenz house, Pat is convinced he holds the answers to the murder spree...

All the right ingrediants for a classic horror movie are present in THE CORPSE VANISHES. Luana Walters is totally delightful as the snoopy reporter on the case, and Bela Lugosi is fabulous as the deranged Doctor. Also very memorable is Elizabeth Russell, playing Lugosi's equally-unhinged wife (she first greets Luana Walters' character by slapping her across the face!).

1783954,3,B00006L90U,"While this movie was definitely watchable, you really only need to see it once.  The movie, while beginning with a great plot and characters, somehow manages to fall from expectations about a third of the way through.  The movie somewhat resembles an episode of Columbo where we know who the killer is and we simply watch to see if the other characters can figure it out as well.

Bela Lugosi plays a mad doctor, who is seen most of the time driving a hearse, picking up ""corpses"" of young brides.  It seems that the doctor has hybridized a type of orchid whose smell causes a similar reaction to that of chloroform.  These orchids are delivered to the new brides right before the ceremony, and shortly thereafter they fall over ""dead.""  Lugosi and accomplices are nearby to pick up the bodies and take them to his estate where he draws their blood and injects it into his wife in order to keep her looking young - somewhat along the lines of the vampire legends of Elizabeth of Bathory.  A female reporter has a hunch  that the good doctor is behind everything and she tries to unravel the secret of the vanishing brides before becoming a victim herself.",1212278400,,1155,4.572815533980583
1783955,3,B00006L90U,"The Plot:  Young brides appear to die on their wedding day.  But where are their corpses?  They have vanished!  Heady stuff.  It turns out that Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) had flowers delivered to the brides.  The flowers were a bit different than those you might get from your local florist.  These flowers caused the brides to go into a deathlike coma.

Dr. Lorenz had a pretty good racket going until reporter Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters, whose career was winding down though she was only 29 when she appeared in this film) got suspicious of the unusual flowers received by the brides.  A good reporter is nosy as well as observant, and Patricia soon locates Dr. Lorenz.

Dr. Lorenz has a house full of weird people, as any good mad scientist would have.  His kooky wife Countess Lorenz (Elizabeth Russell) welcomes Patricia by slapping Patricia's face.  A strange hulking man called Angel (boxer Frank Moran, who appeared in dozens of movies, including ""The Princess and the Pirate"" and ""Road to Utopia"") makes a mysterious appearance in Patricia's guest bedroom.  There are other weirdoes, but I would be remiss if I failed to mention Angelo Rossitto as Toby.  Angelo would have a defining moment in his career as the Master of Master Blaster in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.""  Rossitto also appeared in one of my favorite movies, ""Something Wicked This Way Comes,"" in addition to ""Carousel,"" ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""Dementia"" and dozens more movies and television episodes.

Most of the rest of this movie involves lurking and dramatic moments until the thrilling (would I kid you about thrilling?) ending.  We get to find out why the brides are disappearing.  Hint:  It involves good-looking Countess Lorenz and a needle.  Eventually it all works out, as movies from this era tend to do.

I always wonder whether I should recommend a movie like this one or tell you to avoid it like the plague.  I liked this movie, but then again, I tend to find some movies watchable that others would run away from shrieking in horror.  Fans of campy thrillers and Bela Lugosi might find this movie worth watching at least once.  I am not sure this movie is worth watching twice unless you REALLY like campy thrillers and Bela Lugosi.  I rated this movie three stars because I like Lugosi in this film and there were enough weird characters in this film to give the film some interesting moments.  Of course, if you fail to find any of these things I describe interesting, running away shrieking in horror might be a good alternative.  Or you may wish that YOU had vanished.

Good luck!",1191456000,3,2577,4.782312925170068

1783971,4,B00006L90U,"Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Lorenz an eccentric and of course mad scientist. Aided by an old hag & her two sons, a malicious dwarf (played by Angelo Rossitto of Freaks (1932) and more recent as The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)) and a brutish moron (played by former professional boxer Frank Moran), he uses hybridized orchards to put virgin brides into a comatose state so he can steal their bodies & extract fluids from their glands to keep his ancient wife alive and young. Along comes reporter Patricia Hunter played by Luana Walters who seems to faint when witnessing acts of violence. Never the less she manages to foil Bela's plans with the help of Tristram Coffin as Dr. Foster, a naive but good hearted doctor. The best line in the movie comes after Ms. Hunter sees Dr. Lorenz & Countess Lorenz sleeping in coffins.

Patricia Hunter: Oh, professor, do you also make a habit of collecting coffins?

Dr. Lorenz: Why, yes, in a manner of speaking. I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed.

Not Bela's best work but an enjoyable movie none the less. The tagline reads ""Horror to make your hair stand on end!"" Well this is an overstatement. The movie plays better as a thriller than a horror. Make some popcorn and you have a good rainy Sunday movie.",1140393600,,1271,4.590308370044053
1783972,4,B00006L90U,"Beautiful, young brides are dying, dropping like frilly sacks of flour! Is this some strange coincidence, or something far more sinister? A cub reporter sets out to solve the mystery, soon finding out that all of the victims wore a rare orchid on their wedding gowns. These orchids were grown by none other than Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi), who is terminating and stealing the corpses of the brides in order to extract their bodily fluids! You see, his wife needs these fluids to stay young and alive, forcing her hubby to seek out a fresh supply almost daily! Well, the aforementioned reporter is on the case, visiting Lorenz's creepy estate and looking for clues. She meets Mrs. Lorenz, who quickly slaps her face for no apparent reason. I guess this isn't odd behavior for a woman who sleeps in a coffin (don't worry, Bela does too)! Lorenz's place is loaded with secret passages, a lab, and cool characters; including a dwarf, a hunchback, and an old hag! THE CORPSE VANISHES is one of Bela's better no-budget flicks...",1114992000,,1020,4.768361581920904
1783973,3,B00006L90U,"The first thing you'll notice about this film is that it looks much older than it really is.  Credit the cheap production values of Monogram for making a 1942 film seem like it's an early talky with a grainy picture and muffled sound.  And of course Alpha isn't going to do anything to try to enhance it.

A series of brides are dropping dead right at the Altar and their bodies mysteriously disappearing.  The crimes have the police and local media baffled.  After nearly fainting from sniffing an orchid that the latest victim had been wearing, reporter Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks the rare breed of orchid to the home of Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi).  After she's unable to get a taxi to take her to Lorenz' home, she hitches a ride with Dr. Foster, a colleague of Dr. Lorenz.

At the home she meets a strange group of characters including dwarf servant Toby (Angelo Rossitto from Freaks fame) Dr. Lorenz, and his wife the Countess, who immediately slap Patricia in the face upon seeing her.  Due to a storm, Patricia reluctantly spends the night in the creepy house.  It has all the standard sliding panels and hidden staircases and when Patricia sees a lumbering goon standing over her bed she screams, causing him to flee through a panel.  She eventually enters the hidden area to find the bodies of all the missing brides and discovers that Lorenz is using the blood of the young women to keep his aging wife eternally young, in kind of a Elizabeth Bathory sort of way.  Along with the police and reporters, they eventually set a trap for Lorenz by staging another wedding with a pretty bride, but will the Doctor outsmart them?

A pretty standard Monogram cheapie at just over an hour.  Lugosi doesn't have much to do really but leer at the women and order his servants around.  Elizabeth Russell as the Countess is downright sadistic and cares only that her youth is restored.  The cast is strictly ""B"" movie and no one really stands out.  It's a quickie though and has it's moments even if it is highly improbable.",1112572800,,2026,4.633053221288516
1783974,3,B00006L90U,"This fun horror classic stars the great Bela Lugosi in one of his best roles! Don't expect the plot to make much sense since nothing is ever really explained. Bela plays a creepy doctor who raises orchids and gives them to virgin girls who are about to be married. When the brides smell them, they go into a comatose state and seem to be dead to everyone. Bela and his henchmen (which includes a dwarf played by Angelo Rossitti from the classic film ""Freaks"") then steal the bodies by posing as morgue workers with a hearse. Once Bela has the brides at his laboratory he removes some of their 'fluids', which he uses to keep his sick aging wife youthful looking (his wife is played by the great 40s scream queen Elizabeth Russell). Soon a spunky female 'Louis Lane' type reporter played by Luana Walters is on to Bela, and when she tries to investigate (with the help of a hapless doctor), she discovers that Bela and his wife like to sleep in coffins and other odd things. When she confronts Bela about the coffin beds, he calmly replies in one of his most memorable lines ever: ""I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed"". Classic 1940s b-movie fun. See it!",1047081600,11,1166,4.47887323943662
1783975,5,B00006L90U,"The only thing worse than being left standing at the altar is having your bride fall over dead in the middle of the service.  As The Corpse Vanishes opens, that is exactly what is happening; even worse, the bride's corpses keep getting stolen.  The cops are baffled, but hard-nosed female reporter Pat Hunter is determined to solve the mystery and make a name for herself in journalism.  She follows her leads to the home of Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and winds up having the most terrifying night of her life.  Lorenz has a peculiar staff-a rather annoying older servant and her two sons, one a midget and the other a seemingly mute and obviously dim-witted stooped-over fellow.  Most strange of all, though, is Lorenz's ill-tempered wife.  Of course, the Countess has reason to complain because she is constantly fighting old age and death.  Lorenz has come up with a way to maintain his wife's youth and beauty; the only catch is that it requires the regular extraction of a certain amount of the essence of life from young girls.  Why blushing brides are the specimens of choice is never really made clear.  In any event, Pat struggles to find a way to trap the good doctor and convince her boss that she is telling the truth about the things she has discovered.
Interestingly, there are some definite similarities between this 1942 film and 1931's Dracula:  Lugosi plays an evil man who must steal the life essence from beautiful young women in order to hold mortality at bay; Lorenz secretly enters the rooms of his guests during the night and stares down at them with the look Lugosi is famous for; Lorenz and his wife sleep in coffins; and the dim-witted, eternally slump-backed assistant (called Angel of all things) can be compared with Dracula's Renfield.  The plot is rather weak in spots, but I love the nostalgic campiness of it (and, apparently, the Mystery Science Theater 3000 gang did too).  I would rank this movie among the better horror movies of that golden era of cinematic fright.  Lugosi fans will surely want to have The Corpse Vanishes in their video libraries as it features one of his best performances.
Please note that this review if for The Corpse Vanishes only, even though you may see it linked to a double feature release featuring a second Lugosi movie.",1039305600,9,2282,4.746835443037975
1783976,2,B00006L90U,"Horror icon Bela Lugosi kills virgin brides to extract gland fluids to keep his ancient wife alive. Sounds spooky! It's not. Lugosi plays a mad scientist who heads a burly gang that includes an ugly old hag, a malicious dwarf, and two goons.  They shuffle around in this 1942 boring travesty.  Midget actor Angelo Rossitto(a favorite in many John Barrymore classics) follows Lugosi around. To appreciate the ""Great One"", see 1932's ""White Zombie(excellent DVD) or ""The Black Cat"".

1783977,2,B00006L90U,"Any number of Bela Lugosi's poverty row films would qualify for ""The Best of the Worst"" award. ""The Corpse Vanishes"" is better than average, but just slightly. The story is the typical lurid horror-comics stuff of the mad doctor gone berserk, again and again. The character names change, but Bela essentially plays the same role in the same manner in each film. This entry has the advantage of a good supporting cast. Beautiful ice queen Elizabeth Russell, Simone Simon's feline compatriot in ""The Cat People,"" is the cruel Countess Lorenz. She requires frequent transfusions of body fluid from healthy young women to survive. Dr. Lorenz (Bela) concocts a bizarre plan to keep the fluid supply coming by murdering young brides at the altar. Lugosi's familiar dwarf costar, Angelo Rossitto, is Dr. Lorenz's homunculus partner in crime. The ""stormy night in the terrible house"" segment, as trite as it sounds, is the best part of this little thriller. People sneak around and creep the night away through secret passages to the strains of a plodding musical score. Check out the Lorenz's sleeping arrangements, and try to keep a straight face. If you feel deprived because you don't have a representative poverty row Bela Lugosi film in your personal video collection this movie is for you. The rest should quietly pass by. ;-)",952041600,,1325,5.0

From the vintage film materials they had available a great job and the two films included now get a new lease of life.

Also included is the TV interview which was filmed at the time on 16mm film when Bela had finished filming Old Mother Riley meets the Vampire  and a nice touch to include this complete interview.

7971107,3,B00006L90U,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'The Corpse Vanishes - Bowery at Midnight' released by Retromedia Entertainment Group, Inc. in April, 2017.

Both of these movies are in the public domain and have been available in standard DVD and VHS formats for many years. If you are reading this you have probably seen one or both of these movies and are most interested in the quality of the blu-ray picture and any extra's that might be included. See below for more on that.

My 3 star rating is based on the overall presentation, quality of picture, any extra's and of course....how good the movies are taking into account time period and budget.

BLU-RAY: For the first time, these movies are made available in Blu-Ray. If you are looking for either of these movies with the best picture available then this is it. However, there is much room for improvement. I was actually quite disappointed in the picture quality.

The Corpse Vanishes: The picture quality was much better on this one. There are lots of imperfections. It looks like it was just transferred over to blu-ray with an existing print. There may have been some work on it but I can't tell. The print looks fairly clean for most of the movie but there is definitely a lot of specks and noise from old film visible. I can't imagine that much work was done on it as the picture can be blurry in spots. But overall it is still better than what's out there.
Bowery at Midnight: This movie has a very poor transfer. I'm sure it's because they were starting with an awful print to begin with. Many imperfections are visible throughout and the pictures is not very clear. It doesn't look much better than the quality of a vhs print.
My guess is that Retromedia considered this movie more of a throw in. I feel that due to the lack of extra's and the not so great transfer of 'The Corpse Vanishes' that it is a necessary inclusion. I have to say that I was quite disappointed. This is probably the poorest quality blu-ray movie that I have seen to date.

EXTRA'S: There is but one extra. That is a short (about 5 minutes) television interview of Bela Lugosi that is not all that interesting. That's it.
No scene selector's or subtitles.

PLOT/SUMMARY: I'll keep this brief as I'm sure most people reading this are more interested in the quality of picture.
The Corpse Vanishes: Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) is a doctor that is killing brides to be by sending them an orchid to wear on their wedding dresses on the day of their wedding. The orchid's are poisonous and kill the victim. After the brides die Lorenz arranges to have the bodies stolen so that he can use them for his purposes. He is somehow using the bodies to keep his wife young. A journalist, Patricia Hunter, suspects that the brides are being killed and notices the orchid. She goes looking for the origin of the orchids. She ends up at Lorenz's mansion. She ends up being forced to spend the night there and meets another doctor. All manner of odd things are going on and eventually they figure out what is going on.

Bowery at Midnight: Professor Brenner (Bela Lugosi) is a psychology professor who secretly runs a shelter for the homeless at night down in the Bowery in New York City. He provides medical and food services. He uses the shelter as his headquarters for his life of crime. He keeps his life at the shelter a secret from his wife. Brenner hides criminals at this shelter and uses them to commit robberies. He also keep a drug addict doctor in a hidden room at the shelter. Brenner is ruthless and pretty much kills off everyone associated with his crimes. Unbeknownst to him, the doctor has been somehow reviving all his victims. There is another hidden room in which Brenner buries all his victims. It's sort of like a trophy room to him. It's essentially a small cemetary. Below this cemetary, the doctor is keeping the people he brings back to life. They seem to be like zombies but this is unclear. Eventually Brenner's secrets become known and the police come after him.

THOUGHTS/CONCLUSIONS: I have to say that I actually enjoyed 'Bowery at Midnight' much more than 'The Corpse Vanishes.' Bowery had the makings of a good movie. If a little more money had been available and with a bit more effort it might be more notable today than what it is. Until it showed up on this release I had never heard of it. I actually thought it was a Bowery Boys movie. 'Bowery' is a much more serious movie than 'Corpse.'
Conversely, 'The Corpse Vanishes' comes across as being silly. If they would have put a few comedic lines in, it might today be remembered as a comedy.

Dr. Lorenz and his wife both sleep in coffins. There is no real good reason why as they are not vampires. I guess they were just playing on the whole Bela Lugosi, Dracula thing.

In 'Bowery at Midnight,' it is never made clear if the people being revived are zombies or not. They appear to be zombies but at the end, one of the victims seems to be normal and ready to get married. Possibly they needed a happy ending and changed the script?

Bela Lugosi is mentioned twice in the credits in 'Bowery at Midnight' as playing two different characters.  I didn't think that this was really justified. It's not like he was portraying different characters the way Peter Sellers does in 'Dr. Strangelove.' He was playing the same character. The only difference is that he was keeping secret his personal life from the people he worked with. He was a professor during the day and a homeless shelter supervisor at night and he kept it a secret.

I liked seeing Tom Neal in Bowery at Midnight. I've liked him ever since I saw him in 'Detour.'

It's a decent but not great value for what you get. It's worth the upgrade if you have one of the many low quality prints out there.

I tried viewing the picture on two different tv's. One a newer 4k 65"" tv and the other an older 45"" standard high definition. I'd advise watching this on a cheaper tv. It actually looked better on my smaller tv. The picture did not look good at all on my 65"" tv with all imperfections very noticeable.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I give the Corpse Vanishes 2 stars for the movie, 2 stars for the picture quality. I give Bowery at Midnight 3 stars for the movie and 1 star for the picture quality. The release gets 1/2 - 1 star for extra's. Overall I'm giving it 3 stars for putting two movies on the disk with the best available picture.

No they don't look spectacular but what you expect from two public domain titles. The image quality was a mixed bag, some good parts, some not so good, but it didn't bother my viewing experience as I don't mind gritty black and white movies in HD. Dont expect something Criterion-esque.  Two Bela Lugosi films from 1942 from the same director with also the same contrariness. Not high points in Bela's career but they are fun entertaining films.
