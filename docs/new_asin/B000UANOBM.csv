8560287,5,B000UANOBM,Very good videos. Lots of great info. I learned more from watching the hot stone video than I did from taking a 4 hour class!! The cool face lift video is excellent! Such a great idea of hot and cold stones in a face massage! I plan on incorporating this technique into my business too. Great way to add unique services to massage clients!,1406678400,5,339,4.3125
