2897430,4,B000TGJ8DU,"We can't wait for this DVD!! My husband even emailed Spiffy Pictures to find out when they would make a Jack's Big Music Show DVD. This is, by far, the best kids show around and we enjoy ""rocking"" out with Jack and the gang as much as our little girl does (she's 22 months old). Most episodes feature the Schwartzman Quartet and they all have Laurie Berkner (along with many, many other great artists). We currently have 24 episodes saved on our TiVo and everyone knows they are not to be deleted - so the DVD will let us free up some space. We're personally most excited that this will have the ""Groundhog"" episode that we've always wanted to see, featuring John Stewart! It also has ""Little Bad Wolf"" and one of my personal favorites, ""How Mel Got His Groove Back,"" along with an exclusive DVD special episode, ""Jack & the Beanstalk."" The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars is because I wish it had 1-2 more episodes on the DVD. We truly are JBMS groupies!",1188432000,2,955,4.401129943502825
2897431,5,B000TGJ8DU,"Thank you Jack's Big Music Show! This show entertained our youngest daughter from the first moment she watched it when she was about 6 months old. Not only that, but my older daughter loves it just as much and she was 5. I have to admit that my Husband and I love the songs as much as our kids and sing them quite often...especially the Laurie Berkner songs and The Dirty Socks Funtime Band songs. We have been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a long time now. I'm so glad it will be out soon for us to buy and we can finally free up some space on our Tivo....there was no way we were going to delete these without a DVD backup. Btw, the first season of this show had such great reviews and had parents begging them for more that they couldn't put off making a second season any longer. Hopefully, they are working on the third season now. I have been buying from Amazon for a very long time and this is the first review I've ever written....that's how much we love this show.",1187827200,10,983,4.151832460732984
2897432,5,B000TGJ8DU,"This is in my opinion the best kids show on TV today. I have seen all of the episodes several times and they never get old, I can even sing some of the songs. It was one of the only shows that would hold our boy's attention when he was very young, and it still goes strong as one of his favorites. This show not only teaches kids about music, but important themes such as sharing and telling the truth. The musical guests are incredible and everything about the show deserves acclaim and award.",1185494400,,494,4.26595744680851

This is a wonderful program to introduce your children to instruments, music and imagination.  The bright colors really hold their attention and the fun music they play gets my daughter on her feet dancing and moving and singing along.  We have since purchased many of the individual artists/bands cd's and music videos because she loves music so much now.  Since watching this show she has shown so much more interest in her music toys around the house.

Our daughter asks for Jack by name and dances to the music.

She is pretty indifferent to the TV, but whenever this show comes on, she just stops and stares at it, and then starts laughing and smiling.  I am a bit sad that Mel's Super Swell Dance Party isn't on here, but I am super excited to have found this DVD!!  Like other reviewers, I have a bunch of episodes on my DVR for her, but now I can take it to Grandma's and on long car trips.

I do wish they had a season pack or two out, though, instead of just these four episodes.",1208304000,,332,3.5694444444444446

Strange they didn't do a whole season.  I would wait for a larger set to come out. 15 dollars is too much to spend on 4 episodes.
Spiffy Pictures replied to my email saying it was up to Noggin so please please send emails to Noggin asking them to release more episodes and some merchandise, Dora is pasted all over the place so why isn't JBMS being shared???",1202083200,10,508,4.06

2897697,3,B000TGJ8DU,"Anything Jack's Big Music Show get's a 5 star rating in my book.  My issue with this product is it is claiming to be ""season 1"" however when you receive the dvd it is only 4 episodes, 1 of which was just released in 2007.

The Music Genie
The Bongo Bird Laurie Berkner

2897698,5,B000TGJ8DU,"Our kids, my wife and I love this new puppet show. Jack's Big Music Show premiered on Noggin shortly after our twins were born and they love it. It has the everything a kid's show could offer. Fun characters, music, and enough grown up gags to entertain the whole family (found out that the set up is based on the Jack benny show - even older than I am!)

The one draw back to this DVD is that there are only 4 shows (2 from season 1 and 2 from season 2). We were hoping to clear our DVR because we have every episode aired.

I hope Spiffy pictures and Noggin are listening to the feedback. Everyone wants more Jack!",1197158400,3,616,4.125
2897699,1,B000TGJ8DU,"Like everyone else, my 2-year-old daughter loves this show. So we couldn't wait for the DVD - as we had preordered it for October delivery. The DVD arrived, and the quality was great. However, after watching it probably six or seven times, the DVD no longer would work - in three different machines. We sent it back, and received another. We watched it ONCE, and then the DVD would no longer work. STRANGE! We sent it back to Amazon for a full refund. They apologized and told us that the problem was more widespread than first thought, and they could not send us another until the issue was resolved. Too bad, because it really is a very creative and educational show worthy of more than one DVD. So as you might guess, our family is greatly disappointed.",1195430400,2,756,4.525547445255475

Our daughter Jillian loves Jack, Mary, and Mel and all of their special guests!
She loves the full songs that are showcased between the show segments...those are actually her favorite.  She's been a Jack lover since she was 2 months old...like other have said, the colors and the songs are what attract her.
We have Comcast OnDemand that allows us to watch Jack over and over again, but we give the DVD to family when she goes to visit.  As soon as she hears Jack's mother...if she's crying, whinning, or whatever, she turns towards the TV and starts to giggle and bounce around...I love to see her happy!

She's a great baby, but when Jack is on...she looks at me like I'm a great Mommie!

Wiggles & Teletubbies get a little old, but DH, myself & our 14 year old son all sing along with JBMS. I ordered this for our 8 hr drive to Seattle for the holidays, but I am dissapointed that some of the most boring episodes are on the dvd. I put it in the dvd in the car this morning & she kicked & fussed until I changed from episode to episode & then finally changed the whole disc.  I think when she's going thru Jack withdrawls on a week-long vacation, this dvd will eventually make her happy, but I hope next time they'll give us a full season or another 4 of the more exciting episodes.",1194998400,3,905,4.0

There were a TON of Nickelodeon previews on the disk, and I had to skip forward several times to get through them. There were no snappy intros, and the only bonus features were 2 music videos. It would have been great if there were more episodes on the DVD. The episodes themselves were fine, and the audio seemed to be a tad crisper than the broadcast. Like I said this was a good presentation, but it could have been great.",1193011200,,576,4.198198198198198

As soon as my 18 month old son hears the intro to one of the many, many episodes that I have DVR'd he starts screaming with joy, runs over to the coffee table and does this adorable side to side dance.  It's hysterical! The show is so cute and the music is very catchy too!  I find myself singing the songs all the time to make my son laugh. I am very excited that this dvd is finally coming out because now we can have it in the car for long drives as well. Halleluiah!!! However, I am a bit disappointed that there will only be 4 of the so-so episodes on it. I hope that they are working on getting the second dvd out ASAP with more of the better episodes.  Trust me, it will be a hot seller!!!",1192233600,2,796,3.9874213836477987
2897714,5,B000TGJ8DU,"We wouldn't have survived the first two years of our very ""spirited"" son's life without this show. It is the ONLY, ONLY thing that calms him down and captures his attention when he's having a bad tantrum or night terror. We've watched this on the DVR at 3 in the morning, 4 in the morning, all hours of the day and night over the past 2 years. It NEVER gets old, and I find that really amazing. I can quote all the episodes verbatim, sing all the songs, but I'm not even sick of this show. As an adult I still enjoy watching it.

It's bright, colorful, moves along but doesn't get boring. There is no mind-numbing repetition (a la Dora) and the dialogue is intelligent enough to entertain adults. They manage to teach a lot without banging you over the head that they're trying to teach you (another problem I have with shows like Dora, etc.) Jack and Mary & Mel make learning about different types of music, instruments and even life lessons FUN and memorable.

Our guy is only 2, so obviously alot of it goes over his head. But he is mesmerized by the colorful characters and loves dancing to the music. Lately he's been trying to sing along with the songs too, and has picked up many new words from the show. He's been a difficult (but sweet) kid his whole life, and the only time I ever get a break is when Jack is on. It really engages him and he never seems to get tired of it either.

We owe Spiffy Pictures our undying gratitude for creating such a brilliant, smart, funky and fabulous show. IMO, it's better than Sesame Street was in its heyday, but that's just my opinion. Your mileage may vary, but there is no better show for children out there, period.",1192147200,13,1665,4.347266881028939

Our son has LOVED the show since he first saw it at about 8 months old.  He is now almost 14 months and he LOVES to sing and dance with his favorite songs and episodes.

I will probably not buy any future DVDs unless the whole series is on it. I don't want to have to keep track of a toddler's DVD collection whenever she wants a different show. Not to mention, there are only certain shows that I feel were better than others and I'd like access to them all! I already have the ones I can stand listening to over and over recorded on my DVR for easy access so I'll probably just keep that unless a full season actually comes out.

I can't believe they're finally releasing this show on DVD but they're only putting 4 episodes on one DVD.  Why not the whole first season?  I'd pay more and have all of it because $15 for four short episodes is too much.  And I don't think they're even the best episodes.  The groundhog one was one of the weaker shows, we thought.  The only reason to buy this would be to get the Jack and the Beanstalk episode, and I'm not sure that's worth the price.

No other program does that for him.  It's definitely a life saver when mommy is getting ready for work in the morning!  This program is awesome, if you have not checked it out its a must.
