The ""9-11"" attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 sets the scene in the first 2-minute introduction to this NOVA program. Will Lyman provides excellent narration. The First Iraq War (1900-1991) revealed that Saddam Hussein possessed biological weapons. At that time, it was perfectly legal to order weaponized strains of anthrax from the American Type Culture Collection and NOVA shows the documentation of order 0011966 Bacillus antracis. (While many will dismiss this because the U.S. did not find bioweapons in the later Second Iraq War, where is little doubt in the science community that Saddam did possess them and they were easily destroyed.)  This strain was developed at our U.S. biowarfare center at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Some of this documentary centers around the work of the New York Times investigative team that includes Bill Broad, Judy Miller and others.  Broad interviews Bill Patrick, a retired bioweaponeer, who shows the dispersal of (harmless) germ simulants. Footage of U.S. Army tests with anthrax contrasts the fatal respiratory version versus the less lethal cutaneous that can naturally occur among farmers and workers at leather factories, etc. Good animation of bacteria is used in several segments. The bacteria were engineered for high fatality and dispersal as dry agents. The anthrax letter attack of 2001 had just occurred (at that time, the perpetrator was unknown [and the currently accused is still controversial]). Footage shows military use and testing of aerosols. Richard Spertzel (retired director of a lab) explains effects. Harvey McGeorge explains the unpredictability of germ warfare and its imprecision for battlefield use (mainly against civilian populations). From an economic viewpoint, bioweapons are characterized as the ""poor man's atomic bomb.""

In 1969, Pres. Nixon signs a germ warfare weapons ban that 100+ other countries including the USSR sign. After the fall of the USSR, many Soviet military facilities are left stranded in former Soviet countries including a germ warfare lab built in 1982 at Stepnogorsk in Kazakhstan. Judy Miller visits the empty test facility, the largest in the world, with eleven defunct anthrax bioreactors, facilities for animal testing, etc. The ex-director of the lab explains that they could have killed everyone in the world 9-10 times over (including themselves). They weaponized Marburg virus and attempted to weaponize Ebola. The U.S.S.R. weaponized smallpox that is highly contagious (good animation useful with students) despite smallpox having been eradicated in the wild in the 1970s. Missile warheads are compared for destruction carrying explosives, chemicals and biological agents and each is a scale larger than the former. Smallpox cultures are known to be maintained at both the Russian Vector lab in Siberia and in the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia but there is the possibility of other forgotten stocks (as was proved in 2014 in the U.S.). This video was produced too early to mention the resulting U.S. buildup of smallpox vaccine stocks in response to these revelations that smallpox cultures may still exist in unknown sites. Nor is any mention made of the book ""Scourge""  that discusses the fact that U.S. counter-intelligence ""leaked"" false information to the Russian KGB that the US would continue its biowarfare research in spite of the Nixon treaty.

Judy Miller also visits the Anti-Plague institute at another location in Kazakhstan during an inspection of an old storehouse that finds cultures of plague, tularemia, etc.  This highlights the increased (not decreased) danger after the fall of the U.S.S.R. where the loss of the pensions and employment left both facilities and unemployed science experts ""on the market."" U.S. programs seek to help dismantle this threat. (The extent of this danger is explained ""chapter and verse"" in the book ""Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox"" by Jonathan B. Tucker that was released shortly after this program in Aug 12, 2002.) What took large bioreactors to culture germs now can be done with smaller standard lab equipment common to most biology departments at universities and industries. The Department of Defense discusses how easy this is with standard fermenters. More difficult is engineering the agents to aerosol levels (2-5 microns) so they float in air. It is also necessary to grow more deadly strains with special properties. However, just a few casualties can paralyze a city with fear (in comparison to larger fatality rates from car accidents, etc.)  The Oregon attack with sub-lethal salmonella was early use of bioweapons. In 1960s, the U.S. military developed ""incapacitating germs"" that included Q-fever for possible use in Cuba. There is no evidence the U.S. or U.S.S.R. ever used them, but the U.S.S.R. did move a decade beyond the U.S. at Vector Lab in Siberia to create new germs using molecular biology and gene transfer. Sergei Popov explains the biotechnology and genetic engineering involved.  (Good animation of plasmids used in gene transfer.) A color gene from the sea anemone is transferred to make bacteria red. The U.S.S.R. worked with the Legionnaires disease genes to transform myelin to produce a completely new disease similar to multiple sclerosis but which would be untreatable, untraceable and symptomless. Such new ""superbugs"" could be created by crossing current strains; this is generally too technical for terrorists and requires large governmental science efforts.  In the year 2000, the U.S. ran a bioterror drill that revealed lack of coordination and the overwhelming of resources. This was to some extent confirmed in the 2001 anthrax letter attack. The U.S. has little capacity in its public health services to handle widespread bioterrorism. Buildup of that system would likewise improve the day-to-day healthcare capability.

 The trade book: ""Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War"" by Judith Miller, William J. Broad and Stephen Engelberg released in 2002 also parallels the content of this video.
