8343606,5,B001UGHV0U,"This is a great Dvd with 4 fantastic fights that are action packed. The Gomez vs Davila fight is a little grainy and low Quality but this fight took place in the 70s mind you, so what do you expect. The other Three fights on this dvd are great in quality and action. The Oscar De La Hoya vs Fernando Vargas fight is the highlight of this Dvd. Alot of drama and action through out the fight. This is back when Oscar was on top of his game and he showed a ton of grit and skill. Two of the fights are between Jose luis Ramirez and Edwin Rosario back in the 80's when they were both fighting to be King of lightweight division. Too bad for them that Julio Cesar Chavez and Pernell Whitaker was in the same era with them because these Two could have ruled the division for a long time. They put on two great fights. The second of wich was an absolute punchfest. The lightweight class was stacked in the 80s and these two men were in alot of great fights. The value for the money on this dvd is also great. I lucked out and only paid $6.00 for this great dvd. six greenbacks for three hours of entertainment and a great addition to my fight collection. Plus all fights are in english.",1342569600,,1179,4.152838427947598

Old school diehards of the sweet science get treated to more of that boxing rivalry between Puerto Rico and Mexico to the tune of three of the four fights on this DVD. Meanwhile, the most recent bout included here is none other than that pisssing contest involving Oscar de la Hoya and Fernando Vargas. Here's a breakdown of the fights on this DVD, in order of showing:

It kicks off with Wilfredo ""Bazooka"" Gmez, one of the very best pugilists to come out of Puerto Rico, taking on future world champion, Mexican-American Alberto Davila. This super bantamweight brawl took place on July 19, 1976 and the boxing commentary is in Spanish. But, no worries, for those who don't speak the language, the ensuing nine rounds of furious fisticuffs translate to something that's universal. Wilfredo Gmez won 88 percent of his fights by KO, one of the highest KO win percentages in professional boxing. In 2003 Ring Magazine counted him as one of the top 100 hardest hitting champions of all time (he placed #13 on the list). Can you guess who wins this one?

On September 14, 2002, Oscar de la Hoya finally caved and fought Fernando ""El Feroz"" Vargas in the squared circle, something he'd sworn not to ever do. But Vargas had been clamoring for a crack at the Golden Boy and had been getting on Oscar's last nerve, and when Oscar finally agreed I remember the promotional hoopla that led up to this rumble and the sheer venom and contempt with which Vargas regarded de la Hoya. Fight night for this one was truly an intense, very exciting thing and it felt so personal. Amazingly, the fight lived up to the hype.

I couldn't say for sure who I was rooting for, starting out. Vargas was the younger blue-collar warrior who had captured everyone's imagination. Oscar back then was looked on as this pretty boy who crossed over into mainstream popularity because of his looks. Then too there was the then recent debacle in which Oscar had ran away in his last four rounds against Felix Trinidad. But I was impressed early on as El Feroz hammered Oscar in the first round and hurt him, except that Oscar showed guts and took the pounding. It wasn't exactly a toe-to-toe match, even though Vargas was angling for one. This fight was fought at 154 pounds, a weight class to which Vargas was more suited, and it's obvious from the get-go that he was the stronger guy. Oscar fought a good tactical fight, boxing and jabbing and trying to keep things at the center of the ring. And then late in the fight, the vaunted left hook took over. Fight commentary is provided in English by the HBO broadcast team of Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, and folksy-talking George Foreman.

Vargas was never quite the same after the vicious beating he took from Trinidad. After his fight with de la Hoya, Vargas would test positive for steroids, perhaps the reason why his body was so ripped and cut in his fight with Oscar. Vargas's career would rapidly decline from this point on. For Oscar, there'd be one more day in the sun when he left-hooked the shizzy out of the mouthy Ricardo Mayorga. But tarnish would begin to show on the Golden Boy as he'd soon suffer humiliating TKO losses to Bernard Hopkins and Manny Pacquiao. But at least his CD was nominated for a Grammy.

The third bout on this DVD features a championship match in the lightweight division between the boricuan Edwin ""El Chapo"" Rosario and Mexican Jose Luis Ramirez. Taking place on May 1, 1983, this is the first of their two scintillating slugfests. At this stage Rosario was 21-0 with 20 KOs and Ramirez, himself a hard-hitting slugger and a southpaw, was clearly taking on the challenger's role. Rosario dominated the first six or seven rounds, but then he tired, and it became anyone's fight. Fight commentary by Al Michaels. A great take-no-prisoners kind of fight.

The final fight is the November 3, 1984 rematch between Edwin Rosario and Jose Luis Ramirez, and even more fireworks go off in this one. You would've thought it was over and done for Ramirez as he gets clocked to the floor in each of the first two rounds. But there's a reason that, like Wilfredo ""Bazooka"" Gmez, in 2003 Ring magazine voted Ramirez in the top 100 of boxing's greatest all-time punchers. But El Chapo isn't too shabby himself in that department. This rematch is the most combustible of all the fights on this disc. It also goes the fewest rounds. Marv Albert and ""the Fight Doctor"" Ferdie Pacheco call the fight.

The de la Hoya/Vargas fight comes thru the most crisp and clear on screen. The other three bouts tend to make for grainy viewing. But since these fights are hard to find, you take what you can get. This DVD is worth getting if you're a fight fan, if you like boxers who are so gritty they shave with sandpaper, fighters who consistently put it all on the line, always pressing the issue and looking to put serious hurt on their opponents. These fights all feature explosive exchanges and all but one fight end in brutal stoppages. It's the sweet science, baby, and it's all lovely and bloody elegant in its savagery.",1262476800,2,5131,4.650496141124586
