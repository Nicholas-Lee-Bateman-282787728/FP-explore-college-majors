8138479,1,B000HCO8AY,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! This is the really bad dub of One Piece that was created by a company that openly believes kids are stupid and illiterate. If you truly are a fan of One Piece please buy the voyage sets that are done by FUNimation. I would only recommend this to you if you're either giving it to someone you hate and want them to know how much you hate them, or if your suicidal and need that one extra push that will make you do it after Dragonball Evolution wasn't able to. Seriously buy the FUNimation DVDs for a true One Piece experience.",1517875200,,556,4.254716981132075
8138480,5,B000HCO8AY,"I know many will disagree because it's the 4Kids version of a great Anime.  However, I personally enjoy this for the sake of it being so bad, it's comedic.",1433721600,,155,4.344827586206897
8138481,5,B000HCO8AY,"What can I say about this version of One Piece. Well as much hate 4Kids gets, they just poorly reasearched this anime and I'm pretty sure they would have given up the license at the drop of a pin. But they were stuck with it from 2004 to 2007, so they made the best that they could. I got hooked onto the franchise starting with this dub and when the license was dropped and then picked up by FUNimation, I still watched it. Now while the FUNimation is immensly superior, this is a part of Television history and should not be forgotten.",1354233600,2,537,4.2745098039215685
8138482,1,B000HCO8AY,"WARNING!!!  To anyone who is purchasing this item expecting to find a JAPANESE dialog track, THERE WAS NO JAPANESE DIALOG TRACK on this DVD.  The cover said that ""Not all features can be accessed by certain players,"" but after trying to play it on several different DVD players (and a couple of computers), there was simply NO Japanese track to be found!!!  There is simply the ENGLISH dialog track, and an option to use the English subtitles.  Incredibly disappointing!!!  IF this edition had included BOTH the Japanese and English dialog tracks, I would have given this a 'FIVE STAR' rating--despite these episodes being the ""EDITED NORTH AMERICAN"" versions. [Hardcore ""One Piece"" fans know the difference between the original Japanese episodes, and the American edited episodes...and they KNOW why we would want the Japanese track in addition to the English].  PLEASE release an UNEDITED VERSION of this series...or, at least, release the show with BOTH the Japanese and English dialog tracks!!!",1177977600,6,998,5.20625
