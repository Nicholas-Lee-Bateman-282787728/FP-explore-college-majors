8353047,4,B0026LYLUQ,"America's Living Constitution: An Oral Presentation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights is a 53 minute long educational documentary (plus special features). The narrators, Dave Kuprianiak and Beth Wernick read aloud the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.

The DVD includes readings of both historical documents as well as all the additinal amendments. Each section is completely indexed and contains a bonus feature containing a slideshow of many beautiful monuments throughout our nation. While the speakers are narrating the documents, the document itself is shown on the screen and scrolls slowly as the narrator progresses through the reading.

Because the documents are read word for word, this DVD would probably be best viewed by older children or adults. The only thing on the screen during the narration is the document itself so some children may have problems paying attention to the entire narration.

I think the program would have been more interesting had the narrators explained some of the more complicated wording after each article or section. That might have made it more interesting and captivating for younger children to watch as well.

The bonus feature is a silent slideshow of photographs such as the Jefferson Memorial, Library of Congress, Lincoln Memorial, Navy Memorial, Smithsonian Building, Washington Monument and other important national landmarks. Again, this might have been more captivating for younger children had there been some narration.

America's Living Constitution is a great learning aid for parents who want to introduce their children to these important documents or for anyone who wants to brush up on their knowledge of the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.

America's Living Constitution: An Oral Presentation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights was declared on DVD January 12th from Infinity Entertainment Group and is not rated.",1265241600,,1935,5.36963696369637
