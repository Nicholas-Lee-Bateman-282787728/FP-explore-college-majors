3064527,2,B0011FDVCC,"The major letdown that comes with almost all Hollywood adaptations of stage musicals is that the studios eliminate much of the music.  For example, film versions of ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and ""Cabaret"" lack almost 90% of the original music.

This film version of ""Kismet"" is not that neglectful, but begins by cutting half or more of the Overture.  Then, the opening rendition of ""Sands of Time"" is completely missing, which ruins the bookend effect of having this number open and close the musical.  ""Rhymes Have I"" was reduced from a song important to both plot and character to a few hastily spoken (and mumbled) phrases.  Then there's ""Was I Wazir"" or, actually, there isn't ""Was I Wazir"" -- not even a hint of it.

3064535,5,B0011FDVCC,"In the late 1950s, my father built what used to be called a ""Hi-Fi"", a large speaker system, a vacuum tube amp, a radio tuner and a turntable.  It had great sound!  It was basically a medium-sized PA system.

One of the albums commonly on the turntable was the soundtrack to ""Kismet"".  Borodin's music given lyrics fascinated me, but I didn't understand the plot.

I saw this film on late-night TV back in 1970.  I was blown away!  What an amazing set of performances!

To be completely truthful, I miss one song from the original musical that is not included in this film.  The evil Wazir (played in the film by Sabastian Cabot) has a song entitled ""Was I Wazir?"", in which he and his Secret Police remember how much fun they had, questioning and torturing people!  It is oddly funny.

Wonderful music?  Yes!  Clever plot?  Of course!  Great coreography?  Culturally accurate and some Interpretive Jazz too!  Romance?  Absolutely!

Maybe it's just my copy, or my player, or my TV, but the audio sounds quite compressed when compared with other DVDs.  The picture is great, certainly heads above the previous VHS versions.  And the music, of course, phenomenal.  Just griping about how the audio is presented on the DVD transer.  Anyone else have this problem?",1362096000,,408,4.855072463768116
3064537,5,B0011FDVCC,"I still have LP records of the original Broadway Production. Adaptations of Borodin's timeless melody, with clever dialog in a very exotic locale are forever enjoyable. Hollywood did a fine job of adapting the Broadway musical to the screen.",1359676800,,241,5.205128205128205

3064539,5,B0011FDVCC,"If you think the music of Alexander Borodin is 'stuffy' you may be surprised to know that most of the tunes here are Borodin's, reworked by Bob Wright and George `Chet' Forrest. Fresh from their success with the music of Edvard Grieg reworked into the show 'Song of Norway', tey did something similar with the music of Borodin. There are just two original compositions of theirs - `Bored' and `Rahadlakum'. The rest of the music is pure (well, almost) Borodin. With Howard Keel, Ann Blyth, Dolores Gray and Vic Damone as the stars, this is a `feel-good' movie from start to finish.

The story concerns the poet-beggar Haaj (Howard Keel) and the romance between his daughter, Marsinah (Ann Blyth), and the young caliph (Vic Damone). An added touch of humour is provided by Sebastian Cabot as the Wazir. Much as he wants his son (Damone) married off to a princess, the caliph has other ideas as he is set on pursuing Marsinah. Dolores Gray is sensational as the sultry Lalume, wife of the wazir.

3064540,2,B0011FDVCC,"I've loved the musical Kismet since I was a little kid and Dad brought home the Broadway soundtrack.  Was fortunate to see it at Lincoln Center in the 60s with Richard Kiley and Anne Jeffries.
I figured an okay Kismet was better than no Kismet.  I was wrong.
Ann Blythe is a sweet and strong soprano, and I liked her.  Howard Keel wasn't bad, Vic Damone was unctuous, and somehow Dolores Gray didn't summon Lalume the way I woukld have liked her to be.
The music was messed up; one of the best songs (Was I Wazir; which Cabot could have handled) was totally absent.  The ""And This is My Beloved"" quartet was chopped to pieces; ""Night of My Nights"" was done by a chorus; (which may be okay since it would have been Damone doing the solo.) Most of the other music was lacking the great intros, or entire verses.
Several of the dance numbers were turned from exotic Persian to the typical 1950's jazz moves.
And the capper was the chicken. In the ""Stranger in Paradise"" scene, there's an ""exotic bird"" sitting on a bush.  Look at the comb on its head; it's a damn leghorn rooster  with a bunch of feathers tied to his tail.
That in itself kind of captures the entire spirit of the film.

This is a fairy tale with a lot of dash and style.

8241598,4,B0011FDVCC,"""Kismet"" was a huge hit on Broadway in the early 1950s, but the film adaptation didn't fare as well---it's pretty much become just one of many forgotten 1950's musicals now.

However--- I really enjoyed it! Oh, Howard Keel overplays his part a bit, and while Ann Blyth and Vic Damone have very good singing voices, they are very bland and insipid as the young couple---not much charisma there.

So, why do I like it? Apart from the fanciful and occasionally quite gorgeous sets (this is a fantasy version of ancient Baghdad, having nothing to do with reality), I LOVE the music! Based on classical music themes by Borodin, I think the score is fantastic; it just sounds so ""right"" to me. And the MGM chorus/orchestra does a nice job with it; in very lush four-track stereo, the soundtrack---both score and songs--- is a real treat.

Add to this the presence of the very unique Dolores Grey----Dolores was something else. She only made four feature films back in the fifties, but she worked her entire life on the stage and in nightclub venues, etc. It's a shame she didn't appear in more films, because she has a great voice and is a lot of fun to watch.... And when you throw in a handful of great dance numbers on top of everything else, what's not to like?

Well, I guess a lot of people found something not to like, since the film never really caught on despite the popularity of the source material. But hey----if you enjoy classic Hollywood musicals at all, by all means give this one a try. It's a film I think I'll be revisiting every now and again, because---like I said---that music!

A few months ago this was broadcast on TCM (both the DVD and the TCM print are presented in the original widescreen Cinemascope format) and the airing was bracketed by short interviews with Blyth herself, who still looks fantastic at 85. I'll have to do a little research on the film sometime---she mentioned that Minnelli and Keel didn't get on well at all, and that Minnelli in fact didn't even bother to finish the film; he left and someone else had to mop up. I don't know precisely what the problem was, though---I checked through the film books I have at hand and none of them have more than a few words to say about this picture.",1389139200,2,2231,4.539800995024875
