8253332,4,B0013XZ6H0,"This is a good NOVA documentary from 2008, about the discovery and analysis of the fossilized remains of a Cretaceous creature  ultimately called ""Microraptor"" and also about the surprisingly intense debate which started amongst scientists immediately after this discovery.

IMPORTANT PRECISION: this a Region 1 NTSC DVD - it will NOT work on Europan Region 2 DVD players.

Discovered and named in 2000 by Chinese paleontologist Xu Xing the Microraptor is the first vertebrate to have not two but four wings, as his posterior limbs were also covered with long flight-adapted feathers. That is a fact - but almost everything else about this little, but very impressive creature became subject of controversy. Was it able to really fly, even by short jumps, or did it just glide from tree to tree? Was it a crucial missing link between dinosaurs and birds? Was it a dinosaur at all? Are dinosaurs really ancestors of birds? Are birds simply dinosaurs? Did birds start as wing flapping runners or wing-stretching gliders? Could this bone fit into this bone? Is this way to recreate skeletons even a waliv method or just an artistic vision? Etc, etc.

This document answers only some of those questions as the debate about origin of flight of birds and the relation between birds and dinosaurs still rages on - even if at that stage (in Year of Grace 2014) on one side there seems to be a huge conquering army and on the other just a die-hard group of nay-sayers... This document is actually particularly interesting in the description of scientific controversy by showing how hard is it to achieve consensus and also in how many ways it is possible to interpret facts - especially when so many pieces of a puzzle are still missing.

I found this document surprisingly interesting and watched it with genuine pleasure. As far as the questions debated between scientists, well, not being a scientist, I don't really have a raptor in any of the fights waged around birds and dinosaurs...))) Ultimately, more fossils will be found and the debate will either be concluded or rekindled. Which will probably make for another good document.

The one weak thing was the CGIs - the reconstructed Microraptors looked like wet, pathetic chicken...))) But considering that CGIs are not really the main point of this document, it still remains a good viewing. Enjoy!",1396224000,,2349,4.934177215189873
8253333,5,B0013XZ6H0,"I found this video very informing, and interesting, as I never new there was a four-winged flying Dinosaur.  I found it very interesting, and in lighting at the same time, and seamed very well done.
 I need to review it to say anymore about it at this time.",1383523200,,257,4.333333333333333
8253334,4,B0013XZ6H0,"""The Four-Winged Dinosaur"" is a Nova documentary about a bizarre fossil discovery in China. Come and meet the Microraptor, a four-winged dinosaur! Yes, really. Naturally, a creature of this kind is bound to create some chaos in the family tree. Reminds me of Homo florensiensis a.k.a. the Hobbit. This time, however, the problems are in the family tree of birds and paravian dinosaurs, including the ""raptors"" popularized by the movie ""Jurassic Park"".

The idea that birds are dinosaurs is, of course, immediately compelling - certainly in popular imagination - so the conflicts were bound to be rather fierce when scientists who deny the bird-dino connection tried to use Microraptor to their advantage. Those who do believe that birds are descended from dinosaurs immediately hit back. The documentary skilfully pits the two groups against each other, as they examine the fossil evidence, build models of how Microraptor might have looked like, and bicker in general.

Somehow, the whole thing feels rather forced, since the deniers (informally known as BAND or Birds Are Not Dinosaurs) are a very small minority. There's no real contest. That being said, ""The Four-Winged Dinosaur"" is nevertheless quite entertaining. Come and watch the boys fight it out. I wonder what the Microraptor would have said, had it known what conflicts it would cause millions of years later? I suppose it would gently fly away towards the setting sun, on all its four wings...",1375833600,,1458,5.173728813559322
8253335,4,B0013XZ6H0,"As with most Nova productions, this one was very educational.  I'm so glad they make videos that are so indepth as this!  As a big dinosaur fan, I offer my sincerest thanks!",1299110400,,173,4.375
8253336,5,B0013XZ6H0,"Recently, the internet has an article on a deer that has one horn in the middle of its head.  It's probably just a deformity, but it gets folks excited because it makes us think about unicorns.  Well, here, viewers' imaginations get to go wild because scientists have found a dinosaur that had four wings.
This work does a great job in peeling the onion.  It asks if this is proof that birds descended from dinosaurs.  It questions whether this animal flew or glided.  Were its feathered legs for flight, or insulation and breeding.  The question comes up: did birds start flying from the ground up or were they in the trees and just adapted to traveling at a height?
The term ""missing link"" does eventually come up in the work.  However, these fossils were preserved well because a volcano covered up every nearby living thing so well and the narrator never says, ""like Pompeii.""  They show a fossil of a mammal and that really had me curious, as humans are in that group, but they just touch the topic and move on.
From a descriptive point, this work had highs and lows.  It had animated drawings that were more explanatory to me than CGI, but it had some CGI too.  At one point, they show recreations that looked practically like Muppets and they could have used something better.  You know how it's delightful the way these documentaries can take an ancient Egyptian skull and determine what the person would have looked like in the flesh?  This works the same way because artists have helped the scientists to build a model of this bird/dino and they have it looking vibrant.
Like language trees, they show a tree displaying how beings separated from each other.  It said crocodiles and dinosaurs broke from each other a long time ago.  Wow!  I had no idea about that.  It pointed to branches where the creatures may have had feathers compared to those that probably didn't.
I'm struggling with whether little children will like this work.  As many knows, little kids love them some dinosaurs, thus the success of those dumb ""Land Before Time"" films.  However, this work may ask and answer questions that are to advanced for younger viewers.",1214092800,6,2146,4.692513368983957
