7320382,3,B0112HPVIK,"The Stories are great all Scholastic titles! problem?  There is no problem if you purchase this DVD for your home use. If you are a teacher or a school this DVD does not come with performance rights, meaning you cannot show this DVD in a classroom or any public place. It would have been nice to know that before I purchased this item. Thankfully I was able to return it easily to amazon.",1448841600,,388,4.315068493150685

7320384,5,B0112HPVIK,"Great batch of books that have been animated. Two children under 5 both love this. Only complaint that there are several stories from the same illustrator and I would have preferred more variety though I appreciate the classics and newer title mix. Great offset to our book collection and for only $5, you can't do better.",1446249600,,322,4.767857142857143

7320457,5,B0112HPVIK,"I love all of dvds from this series. I like to let the kids watch movies when we are sick, which is FREQUENTLY, but it's hard to come by G rated movies. PG usually has content they're scared of or something I'd prefer they not view. The problem is I never know what I'm getting. I've read most of these books so I know I'm comfortable with the content and the boys find them very entertaining.",1490227200,,393,4.184210526315789

7320489,5,B0112HPVIK,"I was very excited to find such a great deal on the Scholastic Storybook Treasures DVD.  I previously owned a lot of the stories on this DVD, but since so many were on this DVD, I was able to donate my other ones and save a lot of space.  Even though we have Netflix and Amazon Prime as our primary sources of entertainment, I love having these on hand for something educational and mellow.  It's also great for when the internet goes down!",1466380800,2,440,4.27710843373494

7320529,1,B0112HPVIK,I fail to see how no one has commented on the morbidity of the fairy tales used for this production! I bought this for my young daughter to have some thing to watch while I got ready for work and I am sure the story of Riki Tiki Tavi is now burned into her brain as the snakes plotted to murder the family to get rid of the mongoose.,1455667200,,333,3.8405797101449277

7320533,5,B0112HPVIK,"Scholastic/Weston Woods takes the best of children's picture books and brings them to life with animation (usually) and great readers.  The text is (almost always) the exact text from the book.  There is a subtitle feature which encourages children to read along, but this can be turned off.  This DVD is a great value because it contains 20 of their best productions for a lower price than they usually charge for their DVDs that feature just five or six stories.  This DVD contains...
1.  Cinderella - This is a James Marshall comedy/cartoonish version that is fun, but may not be what your little girl is looking for if she is dreaming of a glamorous Cinderella.
2.  Doctor Desoto - This isn't really a fairy tale, but it is one of the best productions they ever did, so we won't complain.  It's about a mouse who is a dentist.  When a fox comes in with a toothache he and Mrs. Desoto worry about the fox eating the doctor--but they come up with a good plan.
3.  Each Peach, Pear, Plum - Fairy tale characters are hidden in the pictures.  There is no animation, but really there is no way they could have done this book with animation.
4.  Rikki Tikki Tavi - The pictures in this Indian tale are static, which is disappointing, but Michael York does such a fabulous job of narration that I still like this one.
5.  Goldilocks - Another James Marshall comedy version.  I feel there are too many James Marshall versions on this DVD.
6.  Hansel & Gretal - Another James Marshall buffoonish version.  This one is narrated by Kathy Bates.
7.  Harold's Fairy Tale - Harold from Harold and the Purple Crayon fame use his crayon to draw a castle and visit a king.  I like this one.
8.  Lon Po Po - This is a darkish Chinese version of Red Riding Hood.  Pictures are mostly static.
9.  Princess Furball - Too bad the pictures are static in this story about a princess with a lot of spunk.
10.  Rapunzel - Again static/ no motion pictures don't do this great fairy tale justice.  I'm a children's librarian, so I know children don't like the static stories.
11.  Red Riding Hood - Yet another James Marshall silly version.  Not that his books are bad, but there are too many on here.
12.  Three Billy Goats Gruff - Now this is really too bad that the pictures on this one are static and not that attractive.
13.  Boy Who Cried Wolf - This is a funny, silly version.  Sort of like Fractured Fairy Tales.
14.  Elves & the Shoemaker - Static pictures, but wonderfully read by Patrick Stewart.
15..  Little Match Girl - This is not the classic story.  This is an urban story about a homeless girl living in the NYC subway.  Completely different story.
16.  Red Shoes - Modern tale of two girls who love ballet.  Read by Ossie Davis.
17.  Three Little Pigs - James Marshall comedy version again.
18.  True Story of the 3 Little Pigs - This is the best story on this DVD.  It's the old story, but told from the vantage point of the wolf.  He was totally framed; didn't mean to eat all those pigs.  All that huffing and puffing was just because he had a cold!  Really funny.
19.  Ugly Duckling - Static pictures.  A bit long.
20.  The Emperor's New Clothes - A funny version that my library kids love.
Even with some of the stories less exciting than others, this is a great value.  I find a lot of modern children don't know the old fairy tales, so this is a great chance to remedy that with your little ones.",1454976000,39,3396,4.375

8723382,4,B0112HPVIK,"Weston Woods is at it again with 20 animated shorts based on particular storybook versions of classic fairy tales. There are four standout shorts on this set. The Three Little Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and Doctor De Soto. This version of the Three Little Pigs is written and illustrated by James Marshall and the animation reflects this superbly. This is the english version of the story also used in Richard Scarry that effectively adds suspense by the wolf devising three plans to try and catch the third pig: one involving turnips, another with apples and a third with the county fair. I know some of you remember this reiteration. Little Red and Goldilocks are also faithfully reproduced in animated form in the proud Morton Schindel tradition. Goldilocks has a great script adaptation by Gene Deitch and is directed by Milan Klikar. Academy Award nominee Doctor De Soto features great narration, animation and music. Hansel and Gretel is good as well.",1493424000,,992,4.981927710843373
