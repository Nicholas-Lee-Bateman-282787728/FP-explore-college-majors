8274356,4,B0019LL6E8,"The end of an era.

The dvd I am reviewiing is Live at Castle Domington, 1983, which is not the one in the picture above.

In August 20th, 1983 Whitesnake recorded at Donington park this concert which might be the witness of the last great Whitesnake material.

The set list is great, from Walking in the Shadow of the Blues, the opening song,  to Fool for your Loving, the last song.

The band is great too, with Mel Galley replacing Bernie Marsden. Micky Moody is there. Cozy Powell replaces Ian Paice. Colin Hodgkinson (who?) replaces Neil Murray. Jon Lord, DC.

Now, first of all, You need to now this from the start: this 1983 concert is great, if you are a Whitesnake or DC fan, buy it. Don't think twice.

Second, the quality of the video is bad but acceptable, the audio good. Maybe very good? It seems to be a TV broadcast that was recorded on a VHS and then released as dvd. Sounds like Purple Mark IV Made in Japan, doesnt'it? Yes, but the music is so much better than Mark IV Japan......

Now, it is the end of an era.......DC would get the Blackmore disease later on and think money instead of music after 1987.......

The guitar players were not blond handsome tanned shreding guys, they were real musician, real men,
Iike moustached, hat on, glasses on Micky Moody.......no Blond Aldrigde here, the real stuff instead.

You can see something is becoming strange because Jon Lord plays no solo on this dvd. Let me make it clear: in 10 songs, Mr. Lord plays no solo at all..........there are guitar solos, but no keyboard solo......does it remind you of a band that the keyboard player is not a band member just like today's whitesnake, or what?

DC could sing, scream and shout. the one we know from Burn, the one that to be the lead in Purple would sing like crazy to face the Hughes challenge. He is great on this dvd. The Coverdale I love to hear. On ""Ain't No love in the Heart of the City"", Coverdale challenges Donington to sing for him, and they do, oh yes they do, and it seems, at the end, that he cries as he realises the feedback he gets........just like if he knew that it would never be the same anymore........

So, it is the last one, the last witness of a great Whitesnake.

After 1987 it all changes and there is no CD or DVD like this one, none at all.

Enjoy it!",1385683200,2,2295,4.369411764705882
