7802459,5,5555296223,"I've been in love with Nancy Wilson and her exquisite voice since I was 16 years of age. I'm
now 60 years of age and dig her more now than
ever. She is one classy lady. This concert was
probably recorded in the middle to late 80s and
finds her at the top of her game. As good as this dvd is, nothing beats Nancy Wilson live and in
person. I've seen her up close and personal many times in concert over the years through out her long career. Since she is now in her well deserved retirement years, all we have left are a handful of concert videos such as this one. This is a good one because it has full orchestra with
her swinging rhythm section of Lew Matthews,
John B. Williams, and Roy McCurdy. Piano, bass
and drums. I actually ran into Lew Matthews in
a music store a few years ago. He was the nicest,  coolest most down to earth guy you would ever want to meet. If you've never seen or heard Nancy Wilson in person (as I have) and you are a fan, this dvd may be the next best thing. Get this now. You can thank me later. J.
