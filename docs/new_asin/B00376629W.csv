4080611,5,B00376629W,This is the best Korean TV series. there are better pricesplease make sure to shop around before you buy it.,1341705600,,108,4.45
4080612,5,B00376629W,"I don't watch Korean dramas. But my wife got this from the library and I was instant hooked from the start. I was shocked at how addictive this is. It's like video cocaine ... LOL.

Epic story, memorable characters, clever plot and scenarios, cool music ... just make sure that you have plenty of time to watch ... super good. Big thumbs up.

This got me rolling to watch other Korean dramas:

Giant (some parts are interesting, but then some parts are so stupid (e.g., portrayal of US Army general and his subordinate is so idiotic) ... funny thing is that at least 3 characters from Seondeok is in this ... stopped watching after 5 discs ... thumbs down.

Sandglass Wow, super good in a way totally different from Seondeok. Characters are strong, story is strong, and you learn about Korean politics of recent modern times ... if you watch Seondeok, you'll see the actress that plays Misil here at a young age ... the irony is that here, while in college, she is highly against dictatorships and participates in secret student organizations that are anti-gov't while in Seondeok, she plays a person madly obsessed with power and wants to be queen ... Highly recommend, big thumbs up.",1325203200,,1185,4.6826923076923075
4080613,3,B00376629W,"to put it simply - this isn't my favorite South Korean TV drama - i enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DAE-JANG-GEUM/dp/B0009WSO66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DAE JANG GEUM</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COFFEE-PRINCE/dp/B0011Z1T4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COFFEE PRINCE</a>&nbsp;much much more - however - this is a colorful, intense and heavily fictionalized account a of a historical figure - the first female ruler of what is now Korea - it managed to keep up my interest - barely in some places - but the highlights made it worthwhile - a sumptuous costumed treat - strong on characterization and emphasizing intelligence along with superheroic martial arts skills - with some very good actors

the slack parts allowed me to ponder the dilemma in rooting for a queen who wants all her subjects to feel the same way she does - especially about forcing other Korean Penninsula kingdoms to ""join"" them - how do you say ""diversity of opinion"" and ""self-determination"" in ancient Korean

NOTE: the first volume was known to have defective transfers which would cause the player to freeze - most times for a few seconds - but occasionally fatally - unfortunately for me - one of the fatal freezes came at the last episode of the first set - you may find you have to get yours exchanged - Vols 2 & 3 did not have any such defects",1297123200,15,1433,5.62962962962963
4080614,1,B00376629W,"The series is an excellent drama. The main complaint is that the DVD quality is poor. This is the second time that I bought the set of DVDs and more than one of the DVDs is defective. We tried cleaning it, using another DVD, etc, and the video would continue to pause or skip in the middle of play. It is very frustrating that even buying this series the second time would still have defects. Something needs to be reported to the company that manufactures these DVDs.",1293926400,8,468,4.390804597701149
4080615,5,B00376629W,"The great queen seundook is a great series.  Released after Jumong and the King & I, it is still one of the best of the three.  I got hooked on these Korean tele-novellas while on vacation in the Philipines.  But since I could not understand Tagolog that well, I vowed to get these shows if they were available in the states.  And to my luck, they were.  If you like hisory and great adventure and lots of schemes, these are the series to watch.  The Great Queen Seundook is about a girl who is abandonded at birth by the king due to aan age old prophecy.  Raised by her maid, she encounters her older sister, the princess Cheonmyoung, and is escorted back to the castle under an assumed name Doekman.  Though unaware of her royal status or her real self, she is raissed as one of the Hwarang (palace guards).  After finding out about herself, she vows to the take the throne and destroy Misil, who had her sister Princess Cheonmyoung assassinated, the woman who has no passion of anyone except for herself, (she even abandoned her own son who inevitably helps Doekman get the throne.)  I am probably one of the few white people who loves these type of shows and probably always will.  You could say this is the way to learn Korean from these shows, as Sho-gun was for America was for learning Japanese!!!  These shows are truly great in characters, action, comedy & martial scenes, which even make the great Jackie Chan & Jet Li look bad.  If you are a person who likes adventure, drama, great cinematography and great battle scenes and if you don't mind reading subtitles, these series, Ju-Mong, The King & I, & The Great Queen Seondook are truly worth having in your collection and knowing a little bit about Korean history.  This is drama at his best!!",1293840000,7,1756,4.515822784810126
4080616,5,B00376629W,"I simply can't say enough about this excellent Korean miniseries. When I first saw it last year, I only got to see the last half of the series, but I was hooked! Afterwards, I just had to buy the DVD set and I'm so glad I did, what a trip back into 7th Century Korea! This miniseries has every emotion you can think of, the costumes are absolutely beautiful, the scenery is gorgeous, the orchestra is magnificent, the actors and actresses are simply excellent, the plot is unbelievable where it is a constant chess game of life, love, survival, power, whatever as you are constantly on edge to see what happens next! This miniseries is simply phenomenal, you won't be disappointed!",1287792000,9,681,4.636363636363637
4080617,5,B00376629W,"Since there are other detailed summaries of the storyline, I won't go into that here except to say that the only thing that disappointed me was that there are some questionable gaps/events that don't seem to fit the timeline.  Despite that, I can't say enough about the quality of this series.

I have never before watched a tv show or movie multiple times, but I cannot get enough of this show.  It has many wonderful life lessons to learn.  My Sunday School class is currently studying ""The Dream Giver"" by Bruce Wilkerson, and I have been able to parallel the main characters' ""impossible dream"" with the ideas in ""The Dream Giver."" It is very easy to translate the story into life lessons for Christians much in the same way that people have done with ""Harry Potter"" and other movies or tv shows.  In my personal experience, the show made me question whether I have been doing what God planned for me.  Don't get me wrong; there are no Christian references--Buddhism had been introduced in Silla (Korea) at this time, and there are a lot of references to astrology and ancestor worship.  Religion aside, the moral lessons and character traits are high quality.

I agree with the reviewer who stated that it is more of a middle school and up series.  I didn't realize--until I heard a comment on a call-in radio show that ""people want foul and offensive language"" (I don't, and I don't think that's necessarily true.)--that there wasn't a foul word in the entire series (at least not in the subtitles).  There is no foul language, only 2 noticeable (but not necessarily offensive) sexual references, some violence (It was a violent era, after all.), great characters with excellent facial and linguistic expressiveness, a wonderful epic storyline, fantastic cinematography and use of lighting, and I am completely addicted and captivated by the show!  It is the best television show I have ever seen, bar none!",1280707200,7,1913,4.837423312883436
4080618,5,B00376629W,Having seen clips of this series on the internet I decided to buy . I purchased thru Video city and it arrived within a week for me as I am located in France .  The condition of the product is as it should be in pristine condition as the packaging was excellent . Now for the Queen Seondeok . The story is balanced out and is presented in an excellent way I have only reached episode 14 to date and am enjoying it as this great adventure story ( for me ) keeps me totally interested . The subtitles fully inform the watcher and I have been up to speed with this lovely story .There is a fair amount of martial art action throughout which I love .  My only downside is although I have set it up to display only english subtitles it does display some asian script under them although by and large it does not interfere with the english subtitles . Yes I do wish to purchase more of these Korean series as I have been well pleased with the experience . Amazon.com and Video city can look forward to my return at a later date,1280707200,2,1021,4.125628140703518
4080619,5,B00376629W,"The Great Queen Seondeok is a grand, colorful extravaganza of Korean culture over 1000 years ago.  The plots, subplots, villains, heroines and heroes are so intriquing and attention-grabbing. It is in the Korean language with subtitles (English, Chinese etc) which means you have to pay attention...but we were so captivated by the episodes that we enjoyed even the language!
  For anyone who has an interest in the history and culture of ancient Korea (the Shilla dynasty) this is so facinating.
  The storyline begins with the the birth of twin daughters to the King of Shilla and the King's enemies.  The twins are raised separately and unaware of the other's presence for years, while the evil villainess Misil works to undermine the King and seize the throne for herself.  There are  many surprise twists and turns in the plots and characters as well deep emotion, adventure and humor.  This will remain a favorite in our household and I would highly reccommend it.  There is the violence of battle but not overdone, language and sexual content is not an issue so this could be viewed by middle-school children up to elderly.",1274486400,20,1130,4.931216931216931
8390368,5,B00376629W,I absolutely loved this series. I am getting this on dvd. I watched all of the episodes back to back. I hardly slept. It was THAT good..!!!!!!!!,1452816000,,144,4.37037037037037
8390369,5,B00376629W,"This is a freaking great series.  I watched it on a Korean cable channel originally with my wife and we got seriously hooked.  It is not an accident that I have seen Korean dramas on airport TVs all over the world.  And this is the best of the best.  Trust me - you will be up all night, cause you can't watch just one episode.
There was one scene where the to-be queen as a kid is framed with Fort Jiayuguan in China, where the Great Wall begins in the west, in the background.  This impressed me so much I included this destination on my next trip to China and got a picture from the same spot.  The production values of this series are outstanding as is the acting.",1443484800,,668,4.1395348837209305
8390370,5,B00376629W,"This is a great story. It requires some patience at the beginning to understand the framework of this epic. I had watched
The story 2x on netflicks and enjoyed it so much I bought the set of DVD on amazon.",1411257600,,205,4.15
8390371,5,B00376629W,"Intense palace drama. Can't get enough of it. If you like dramas set int he historic period of Korea, you'll like this one for sure. It is a great addition to your collection.",1391817600,,175,4.333333333333333
8390372,5,B00376629W,"What a roller coaster ride of palace politics, intrigue, murder, betrayal and forgiveness wrapped in a historical vehicle.  Loved it.",1386028800,,133,5.65
8390373,5,B00376629W,one of my favorites of all time.  this movie brings back memories and well as continuing to tickle me as I watch it again and again,1385164800,,131,4.038461538461538
8390374,5,B00376629W,"It's a magnificent story, with wonderful actors. From the costumes, to the photography, to the customs of the era, it's exquisite. The individual actors become real people to the audience, with their characters fully revealed and understood. Other than more typos than I would have liked, and captioning a little too quick at times, it's still a great series.",1383696000,,359,5.101694915254237
8390375,5,B00376629W,"Some friends at work were talking about this series, and while I found it interesting, it took me awhile to check it out. When I did, I was hooked from the first episode. Everything about it was well done, from costuming, sets, to the acting. I have always loved mini-series, as it gives time to develop the story fully. I'm a history geek, and plan to get some books on the history to learn more. I just wish this was known more, as it deserves a wide audience, Thank you, MBC America, for distributing this!",1363478400,,509,4.368421052631579
8390376,5,B00376629W,"WOW, the scenery is amazing, te historicepic is so well done you will be up all night every night to see the next twist. And want MORE.
why can;t we do these tye of gisorical epics. WOW",1342656000,,185,4.027027027027027
8390377,3,B00376629W,"Very interesting story.  Heard about the Queen Seondeok but didn't know much about her.  I'm glad they're branching out and exploring historical characters outside of Chosun Dynasty.  Overall, I liked the story and the characters but it's not the best historical drama I've seen.  So here are my complaints.

1.  Like a lot of Korean dramas, this one also relies too much on misunderstandings and lies to move the plot forward.  When someone asks you if you've ever lied to him/her, that's because they probably think you did.  So don't lie and say ""No, I've never lied to you.""  Anyhow, so the plot moves along... lies then misunderstanding... people don't talk when they need to... misunderstanding...  People go from trusting to not trusting and then everything's well and then something else makes them distrust each other.. happens a lot so fast back and forth...  sigh...

2.  The story took place in ~600 AD.  That's 1,400 years ago.  I'm not sure what kind of language they used back then and I'm sure nobody really knows.  However, I'm pretty sure they talked very differently than now.  I'm really surprised that the writers and actors made no significant effort to change the way they talk and interact.  It's very casual and 21st century.  It's not a deal breaker but personally, I thought it took away from the setting and overall atmosphere of the show.

3.  It goes back and forth between historical periodic drama, comedy and some weird kung fu.  They tried too hard to be everything.  Once again, I felt like it's just too 21st century.",1342396800,2,1553,4.799242424242424
