3771994,4,B001R10BIW,"I do not watch horror movies.  I feel that the old addage, ""garbage in, garbage out"" holds true with what you watch.  This movie is just suspensful enough to keep your pulse up a little but not so gory or sexually perverted that you cant allow young teens to watch it and get a good message from it.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves GOD and believes that his angels are hard at work here while Satans demons are doing the same.",1239321600,3,438,4.190476190476191
3771995,4,B001R10BIW,"This movie wasn't half bad. I enjoyed it. I have pretty sound nerves but I actually jumped a couple of times. Although, I figured out the mystery to the story long before it revealed itself, I followed it to the very end. I think I would watch it again. It's not gorey and it's void of the usual sex scenes, if you like that kind of thing. It's just a creepy, twisted little tale that reminds me a bit of some of Clive Barker's work. It's worth the watch.",1239321600,46,455,4.123595505617978
3771996,4,B001R10BIW,"There is a new genre of horror film growing that I recently read about in the pages of Rue Morgue Magazine. The genre is Christian horror films. Though it may sound like an unlikely combination, it is here and on the rise as well.

You could go back as far as THE OMEN of THE EXORCIST to find the beginnings of the genre, but even recently we have seen movies like THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE take off and become a blockbuster film. Now we have a new movie to add to the mix, a bit more subtle in some ways and not in others.

HOUSE is based on the book of the same name by famed authors Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker. The story begins innocently enough (as they always do) with a couple on the road getting lost in the boonies. This particular couple, Jack and Stephanie Singleton (Reynaldo Rosales and Heidi Dippold), are on their way to Montgomery to visit and marriage counselor.

Along the way they are re-routed by a helpful policeman (Michael Madsen) and take a short cut only to end with two flat tires and what looks like another possible couple in the same boat. Following the road they come to the Wayside Inn where they find no help but they do find the other couple, Randy (J, P, Davis) and Leslie (Julie Ann Emery). The power goes out, they find lanterns and then they find the caretakers as well, an oddball backwoods pair who seem to have come out of the past. They inform them that on a rainy night like this no tow truck will be able to help them and that they'll have to spend the night.

Betty (Leslie Easterbrook) appears to be in charge and she's all about manners and trying to make things fine for the two couples. Pete (Lew Temple) is definitely a few fries short of a fun meal and more interested in Leslie than anything else. As dinner is about to be served, the last house member shows up. Stewart (Bill Moseley) is a roughneck with no holding for sinners.

As odd things happen (like they haven't already) Stephanie panics and heads for the front door to get out only to find someone standing in the yard, flashlight in one hand, shotgun in the other. Betty blames them from bringing ""him"" back...the Tin Man.  The Tin Man tosses in a can with his rules. Rule 1, this is his house. Rule 2, anyone who enters his house he will kill. Rule 3, kill one person before sunrise and he'll forget rule 2.

Angered at their supposed bringing the Tin Man back. Betty and her clan set about containing the four ""guests"". As they attempt to lock them in the freezer, the two couples escape and head out in different directions.

While Stephanie disappears as does Leslie, Jack and Randy search for a way out. What they discover in the basement is more worrisome though, Satanic symbols on the walls, draped over images and tunnels that go every which way. And as they are separated and continue to search, they come across a ghost or two as well.

The biggest twist to the house is not the people running it. The twist is that the house knows its guests. It knows what eats at them. It knows what they did in their pasts. It knows what haunts them. And it will use this information to manipulate them all.

What we have is neither a simple ghost story nor a tale of satanic rites being enacted on innocents. There are no truly innocent members in this group. One killed a father, one an uncle and two are suffering from the accidental death of their child. What the house offers them is a chance at redemption. But in what form? Will it be delivered to them if they take the life of one or if they sacrifice their own lives willingly? Or is there another alternative?

The movie offers some creepy moments but at the same time relies too heavily on the tried and true worn down appearance of the house and beaten down look of Betty and her group. Anyone who couldn't tell this bunch was off in 5 seconds deserves what comes to them.

But it's not the actors or their roles that draw the attention. It's the story that brings about that sense of loss and search for hope in the midst of something so terrible that carries the film. No, this is not GONE WITH THE WIND. It is not the grandest horror film ever made. But it is well made and suitable for younger, though not too young, viewers with its lack of gore and blood.

If you're looking for a solid horror film with more story and blood, give this one a try. If you're looking for something with a little hope to it, try it as well. Just know that the expected doesn't always happen in films like this, Christian horror or not.",1238976000,6,4495,4.330558858501783

3772023,5,B001R10BIW,"Jack Singleton (Reynaldo Rosales) and Stephanie Singleton (Heidi Dippold) struggle with the loss of their daughter and might or might not be the cause of her death. Leslie Taylor (Julie Ann Emery) struggles with the memories of her uncles abuse and Randy Messarue (J.P. Davis) deals with memories of an abusive father. All four have three things in common: they have all been in a wreck, they are all trapped in a house and they all have dark pasts. In this thriller, not everything is as it seems. Suddenly, each character is being hunted and the owner of the house is the hunter. He is preying off their deep dark secrets and their sins. He is determined to turn each of his guests against each other. Everyone struggles to fight the evil within them as their will to survive reaches its peak. With evil whispering in their ears at every turn, the struggle to find the good becomes futile and survival seems impossible.",1453161600,2,921,4.656441717791411

I know movies often take liberties with the book, but in this case the movie in NO WAY even vaguely resembles the book.  If I were Dekker/Peretti I'd have sued to stop this release, or at the very least to get my name removed from it.  Besides the fact that the movie bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book, it's just not even a good horror flick.  Utterly predictable, generic, and boring.  I do not get at all the couple of reviews here talking about it being scary - it's not at all.  I could only watch about 1/2 of it, yawning all the way.

The one thing I found almost comical is that while some of the actors were very flat and not acting enough, other actors were WAY overacting. It made for odd interactions. Usually in low budget horror films, you either have a lot of flat acting or all overly dramatic so it was a bit weird to see them together and it made the interactions less believable.",1436486400,,515,4.319587628865979

Fortunately they don't make it a focal point. The rest of the film, sans satanic baphomet scrawling on the wall, would have conveyed the point of the story quite well. The writers needed to tighten up the script without throwing in the annoying cliche elements.
The movie as a whole is rather episodic, it has it's moments but it meandered all over the place the ending was too saccharine.

It's not subtle either, everything has you questioning, ""Why would you do that?"" or ""Why would you say that?"" etc. At first it seemed like really bad writing, but it was so prominent that I began wondering if that was the point, that everything was part of someone's dream or something similar.

We're too smart to be genuinely scared, and most movies just try to make you jump with stuff flashing on camera without actually creating the atmosphere. At least the attempt to make a frightening atmosphere was made. I want to be drawn in by the premise, and this movie does a better job than the vast majority.",1413763200,,403,4.45945945945946

3772170,3,B001R10BIW,"I really thought this was going to be a better ""horror"" movie.  But it wasn't. I mean it had a good story line, it had loads of potential for being super creepy and scary especially with what was behind the curtain. But it just lacked.  And based on the trailer, I waited till daytime to watch this lackluster of a scary movie for fear of bad dreams...pfft what a let down. Now I have bad day dreams about corny endings and movies that don't live up to expectations.

Sadly I think all the good or potentially good Horror flicks aren't on Prime and that I may have to shell out a few bucks, since I haven't seen them on NetFlicks or Redbox either.

The things we are willing to do for a good scare.  You would think the writers and directors would know. With TV the way it is today, and all the shows today that are in the Horror- Genre that are pretty good, (Walking Dead, Supernatural, Z-Nation, American Horror Story, Haven Ect, Ect )  TV shows have upped the game on the genre, and are giving movies a run for their money, so in turn movies have to take it to the next level. I don't mean super gore, or special effects. But story lines and scare-ability.. totally.",1413504000,,1169,4.290909090909091

3772178,2,B001R10BIW,"1.5 stars rounded up to 2.  House wastes no time.  There's little set up or character development.  It goes from zero to creepy (or tries to be creepy) in 5.2 seconds.  The result is that the creepiness is more comical.  It reminded me of Rocky Horror Picture Show.  One minute you're driving down some back country road in a rain storm and the next minute you're dealing with Riff Raff.  But, this will never become a cult classic like RPS because it doesn't have style.  And it also isn't trying to be anything but scary.  The ending is sappy and stupid.  I was considering 2 to 2.5 stars until the last 3 minutes.  It felt like a low budget made-for-TV movie.

One reviewer said this was 2 hours of his life he'll never have back.  My suggestion is that these cookie cutter movies are just background movies.  I try to make these 2 hours productive.  I just need something in the background while I'm working on some project that doesn't require much concentration.  Once in a while, I run into a gem that warrants actually shutting down the project and focusing on the movie.  House ain't one of those gems.",1413072000,,1111,4.475

3772245,3,B001R10BIW,"Some of the character actors' portrayals were ""campy,"" to say the least, and gave several scenes that ""B-Movie Horror Flick"" feel. It was so over the top in one or two scenes that it seemed as if it had to've been intentional. These laugh-inducing scenes were all near the beginning, so maybe it was a playful nod to the genre, before moving on to an otherwise solid film. Several of the main characters' roles were done quite well by their actors, some of whom were new to me. One of the plot elements was interesting, made you think, and diverged widely from the usual slasher script. These four sub-stories could have been developed more, although I could see how doing so would have made the movie a lot longer.

The cinematography, effects and production values were of very good quality. I suppose filming in Poland helps your budget dollars go a lot farther. On a smaller note, however, almost no attention was paid to details which would lead the viewer to believe the story was taking place in Alabama, as portrayed. Having lived in Alabama for almost 50 years, I saw a multitude of missed opportunities as well as a few flat-out mistakes. They should have hired me as a technical contributor; for a European vacation, I would have worked cheap. ;-) The movie was OK, but it is not, however, a movie I would go out of my way to view again.",1403308800,,1348,4.5473251028806585
