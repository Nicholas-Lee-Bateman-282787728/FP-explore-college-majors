8382134,4,B002VJKAZI,"Shooting 3D is a great introduction to general practices and principles of 3D shooting.  From a high level, it covers all the major aspects of shooting 3D and gives a good overview of the 3D video production pipeline including some challenges and specific details most other intro's leave out.  I recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about shooting 3D.  I also heard that the alignment tool shown in the video may be available for purchase soon, which will significantly ease the pains of post production alignment.",1264464000,,531,5.011363636363637
8382135,2,B002VJKAZI,"A 20min video that brushes over many of the basic elements of 3d production, like what cameras setups and playback formats there are. All of this information is widely available for free and will provide alot more detail than this video offered. There was one point that gave incorrect information, where they showed a machine vision camera as being unusable because the sensor placement may be too off. This offset may be the difference of a few degrees at worst and is undetectable, which isn't to say that professional cameras aren't the same way, as sensors can only be placed so precisely.

The video quality was quite poor considering that a professional production house made it, however that makes little difference except when trying to freeview the various 3d examples within the movie or discern what buttons they're pressing during post. All in all, its a good video if you have absolutely no clue how 3d production works and need a primer, but past that you're better off getting the book ""3d movie making"" (which is littered with vagaries and incorrect information as well), or even better, just googling for it.",1260403200,4,1126,4.895287958115183
8382136,2,B002VJKAZI,"I wanted to watch and learn 3D Camera moves
This is insufficient material and it gives only 20 minutes of total footage.

Everything seems to go so fast and it is incomplete
But I did get a good introduction for 3D movie making.

I would have liked it to be atleast 1.5 hours for this subject.
May be the authors do not want to share their trade secrets and are holding back information not a true learning material just a good introduction of the various topics

too expensive really it should not cost more than 8.00 dollars for the amount of information provided.",1258675200,5,566,4.475728155339806
