3089185,1,B0012GVKY6,"It is really not worth the money. As a workout, the three levels of workouts are not aerobic enough and too repetitive. As a Ballet class, the moves are too simple and there are a lot of other options.",1229904000,3,201,4.17948717948718
3089186,3,B0012GVKY6,"This Ballet DVD is broken down into beginner, intermediate, and advanced. However, both the intermediate and the advanced are the exact same workout. In other words, the advanced portion is the exact recording of the intermediate, with a disclosure at the start saying to ""just kick higher"". I was so extremely disappointed because I was soooo hoping for more challenging ballet moves. Also, each segment is only 15 minutes long. So it's hard to get a full, challenging ballet workout with this disc, unless you're willing to play the same sequence of moves twice. Elise Gulan's Ballet Conditioning is a far more challenging and full length workout.",1224460800,13,649,5.074766355140187
3089187,5,B0012GVKY6,"This is a great video for beginners who are looking to flesh out their at-home workouts.  I love dance videos and thought I would try to add ballet to my repertoire.  This video is fun, a good workout, and started at ""beginner"" so I found it easy to learn.  This is probably not a good video for anyone that has taken lots of ballet, but if you are a novice like me, you will probably like it.",1218240000,8,393,4.077922077922078
3089188,4,B0012GVKY6,"I did ballet for about 12 years.  I hadn't taken a class since I was 17, although I have taken other forms of dance since.  I am 27 now.  This DVD was like transporting myself back into ballet class.  The dancers are beautiful, the music is nice, and Jennifer Kries is pleasant to watch as always.

I just tried it for the first time, and started with the Intermediate workout.  It was challenging!  I very much enjoyed the workout.  I got a decent cardio workout from it too.

My only complaint, and reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it was too short.  At 15 minutes or so, you are just getting going!  The DVD is over quite suddenly, and your heart is pumping, and you're left going ""that's it? no!""  In my opinion 15 minutes is hardly enough time for a good workout, even though you will be sweating by the time the 15 minutes is up.

I think this will be great for days that I want a shorter, but good, all over workout.  Maybe on days I do yoga as well.  I think this would be a good place for beginners to start, considering the length of the workout and the different workouts for each level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).  This will be one of my favorites.  I've looked at other ballet DVDs out there and I think this one may be the best.  Too bad it's not longer!",1217376000,22,1294,4.2122448979591836
3089189,5,B0012GVKY6,"I just received and viewed. This is a nice alternative to attending class. Or, a great workout if you do not attend class. A chair might be necessary for novices.

8245895,3,B0012GVKY6,"If you have Target Specifics DVD, it's pretty much the same thing as the hips section.  Ballet-inspired.  Nothing really new to report.",1444608000,2,135,5.090909090909091
8245896,5,B0012GVKY6,"This video has completely changed my body & put my confidence level & coordination through the roof.  Jennifer Kries is lovely to work with, as usual.  There is no equipment needed which makes it a plus.  Everyone needs this video! :)",1359331200,,234,4.658536585365853
8245897,2,B0012GVKY6,"I thought there would be more of an introduction at the beginning.  In my opinion, you need at least a beginners knowledge of ballet before using this video.  If you have no knowledge of ballet, this might not be the video for you.",1351468800,,231,4.348837209302325
8245898,4,B0012GVKY6,"I actually enjoy this.  I was afraid it was going to be something long, that I'd have to work at fitting in.  Turns out it's three sections, 13-17 minutes long, and they are all the same routine, beginner, intermediate and ""advanced.""  You begin at a very basic level in the first one and then add more reps, more extension, whatever, in the next level.  The concept makes sense if you think about the precision that ballet requires.

This is meant for people like me who never took ballet in their lives but would like to explore it. Jennifer Kries is a former ballet dancer and she's very, very good at teaching it.  I would give it five stars but three versions of the same routine is a bit limited.",1349222400,,702,4.403100775193798

8245900,5,B0012GVKY6,"This is great if you have some dance or Pilates background, and/or you're not in great shape and/or you're a beginner.

Set against a blue skies background, Jennifer teaches basic ballet movements in an approachable manner.  (I have the NYC Ballet Workout, and it is intimidating, even though I took ballet as a child and was a professional Pilates teacher for seven years.)

This is great if you're looking for a quick morning workout, and I really wish it had been marketed that way.  This isn't for purists--but it's great for someone looking for an approachable fast ballet practice for early morning!",1261872000,4,605,4.901960784313726
8245901,3,B0012GVKY6,"I was dissapointed with this item. I thought this was going to be a ballet inspired workout, you know, learning how to stretch, grow taller, look and actually feel more toned. The first (beginner) workout is only 13 min. long. The second is 16 min. and the last approx. 20. There is no floor work, no streching, etc. The best this DVD can be used for is a warm up before any other fitness dvd. It's a good warm up, but that's all. I recomment Element Ballet, of even better, The New York City Ballet workout double discs, now those are real ballet workouts. For more advanced work see Finis Jhung ballet DVD's. They are professional, they are beautifully produced and the directions are en pointe... They are worth the money. You can review them on his website. If you want a pseudo ballet warm up, then I would reccomend this.",1251417600,3,827,4.483443708609271
8245902,3,B0012GVKY6,"I did like the workout but it's quite dissapointing at the end. When you reach Advanced level, you find the exactly same repetitions as in Intermediate. In fact, it's the same recording with an innitial cue to raise your legs higher. For beginners it's very good because of it's reps and explanations. For more intermeidate or adavanced levels you get to feel the workout but you will also probably feel like you wanted a more variate group of excercises or combinations. If you expect coreography, this is not the workout for you. I only recommend it for those who want to learn the very basic ideas and names of the steps and put it into practice throughout constant repetition. Otherwise, try something different. The workout is too short if you want to adress all levels: 15 minutes each. Overall, I think there are better ballet workouts, like NYC Ballet.",1243468800,2,860,4.778523489932886
8245903,3,B0012GVKY6,"The DVD is perfect for the individual seeking gentle stretches and some work on body grace and poise.  But if you are seeking to truly develop tone using ballet moves, this one will be too basic.  If you are not really seeking more than stretches, this one adequately will give you a safe and easy workout.",1236470400,5,306,4.446428571428571
