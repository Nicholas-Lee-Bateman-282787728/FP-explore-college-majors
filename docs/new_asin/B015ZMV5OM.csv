7454150,5,B015ZMV5OM,What a great movie this is and really like this movie. colorful movie great scenery and for  laughing and it's a great family movie for Christmas or anytime of the year and any day. This will be the first Christmas movie I ever own on DVD. And I can't wait to own it on DVD and have it in my collection of DVDs!,1452124800,,311,3.9365079365079363

7454152,1,B015ZMV5OM,"A TOTAL stinker!!! I can never get back the time wasted in this movie. Acting was not good, the story line was very slow and undeveloped, the portrayal of families spending time together was painful. Painful is the best word that describes the movie. My whole family was groaning when we finally turned it off halfway through. Save yourself the time and pick another one. We are a Christmas movie junkie family, and this one will go down as the world's worst...",1451260800,2,461,4.634146341463414
7454153,1,B015ZMV5OM,"I normally love Christmas movies, however this was a complete waste of time...horrible acting, underdeveloped characters and story line, and much more left to be desired.  Would have given it a rating of 0 stars if possible.",1451260800,,224,5.054054054054054
7454154,4,B015ZMV5OM,"Sharron Holden (Olivia dAbo[the hippy, blond, teenage daughter from THE WONDER YEARS]) is a loving mother, a wife but...a work-aholic.
She's due a promotion, but her husband Dustin (Anthony Starke), feels she has NO time for him and the family. Sharron's work seems to
always come first. Dustin decides the family should vacation over Christmas;  Sharron, reluctanty, agrees. While on vacation, she has a
nervous breakdown, and imagines that life WITHOUT kids. A man claiming to be Kris Kringle arrives, and shows her how empty life IS without
her children.
That said, I enjoyed this 79-minute movie.
Sorry! Couldn't help but think the teenage daughter played by a British, twenty-something, woman on a classic TV show was---jeeze!---a bit
old for the part of a young mother: she IS 47-years old.",1451001600,2,796,5.123076923076923
7454155,1,B015ZMV5OM,"If you want a good Christmas film that gives a glimpse of a different life try ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE and THE FAMILY MAN.  This one was a total waste of my time.  Unbelievably superficial and materialistic.  That mountain of gifts made me want to gag.  I am not all that politically correct, but this is a film for, by and about white folks.  ( I am white by the way so I can speak.)  Even the dog is white.  Cringe!",1450656000,,414,4.037037037037037
