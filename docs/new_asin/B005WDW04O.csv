8487879,3,B005WDW04O,It was good for what it was.  I just came back and it was enough for a good taste of Alaska.,1380326400,,92,3.380952380952381
8487880,5,B005WDW04O,"I purchased this item due to the fact that it is the first Blu-ray disc of the Inside Package of Alaska.

I have purchased a number of VHS tapes and DVDs of the Inside Package.

This production beats all others hands down.  The images are striking.  I recommend this to anyone who has traveled the Inside Package or is considering doing so.

It deserves a rating higher than ""excellent.""",1357257600,,387,4.550724637681159
8487881,5,B005WDW04O,"We were going to go on a cruise to Alaska and see the inside passage this DVD has wonderful Color and took us to all the places we would be going to, it even shows the towns a bit too which most do not! If anyone wants to see what the towns are like this is about the best one out there. All the others don't take you to the towns only wildlife. Granted there could be tons more to show and be said about the towns but at least this one does some!",1340496000,3,447,3.765957446808511
