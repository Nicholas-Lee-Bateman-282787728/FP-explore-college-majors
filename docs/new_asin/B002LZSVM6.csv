3950199,4,B002LZSVM6,I've seen programs on science that cover some of the material covered in this program. But this gives a different slant or perspective. All in all an enjoyable watch for a professed Science nut.,1362355200,8,194,4.735294117647059
3950200,5,B002LZSVM6,"I am NOT SALLY TARVER, I am her friend, a mathematician, and was entertained and pleasantly surprised by this film. It makes very esoteric mathematics understandable without equations - with examples everyone is familiar with, like weather! No global warming stuff here. Politically neutral!

3950201,2,B002LZSVM6,It was actually somewhat informative until the 'global warming' propaganda at the end.,1479513600,,86,5.6923076923076925
3950202,5,B002LZSVM6,I really love this movie. I can't express the joy of finding a random doc that you saw in your youth and has stuck with you since this same youth but you didn't know the name of it so google was useless once google came into being...i'm not sure where or how to end this sentence. There I did it. This made me want to get into math when I was a kid because it showed the amazing breadth of the field and just how interesting it can be.,1478908800,,435,3.898876404494382
3950203,4,B002LZSVM6,"Although the interviews are all old (late 80's / early 90's?), the information is still all accurate and very relevant to understanding complex systems.

3950209,5,B002LZSVM6,"I'm not a scientist or mathematician, but this program was fascinating! It explains how man is challenging order and disorder through the use of computers, and an actual science termed, ""Chaos"". Man, for example, has tried to control the weather, but found that he cannot - weather is simply too big a thing to control. The European Weather Center is the world's largest weather center, and in order for them to predict a 10-day weather forecast in advance, it takes three hours and 400 million computer calculations per second to predict what the weather is going to do over the next 10 days.

The rules of chaos are universal. ""Period Doubling"", for example, is characteristic of some systems making a transition to chaos. Doubling is followed by quadrupling, etc. An example of a map displaying period doubling is the logistic map. This program also explores fractal triangles. A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal dimension that usually exceeds its topological dimension and may fall between the integers. Fractals are typically self-similar patterns, where self-similar means they are ""the same from near as from far"". Fractals may be exactly the same at every scale, or, they may be nearly the same at different scales. The definition of fractal goes beyond self-similarity to exclude trivial self-similarity and include the idea of a detailed pattern repeating itself - like triangles within triangles.

Scientists are also exploring turbulence. When turbulence in water increases its flow it produces chaos. Jupiter, the planet, is a planet of water in chaos. Even in trying to change our own earth's climate, we are learning how to avoid the catastrophic and control the known.

This was really a great program! Well written and produced. Is order chaos, or does chaos produce order? We may ultimately never figure that one out, but for now, we are still exploring this wonderful new science called, 'Chaos'.",1465776000,,1931,5.085173501577287

3950213,3,B002LZSVM6,good for anyone not familiar with the subject. In my mind it goes too far into specific subjects and does not explain the overall concept of chaos as well as it could,1463788800,,166,4.21875

By todays standards, it's a pretty early look into the science of Chaos. Some points it rushes past, others it repeats over and over again. Nonetheless, it's a worthy documentary, if for no other reason than many luminaries of the field are featured, including Lorenz, Mandelbrot and Feigenbaum.",1459728000,,488,4.741176470588235
3950219,3,B002LZSVM6,"I am fascinated by fractals and chaos theory. This film is academic talking heads -- some too obscure to understand.

Now that scientists have recognized it, they can inspire the next generation of scientists to continue the posterity of science. Maybe we are not meant to explain it, but to recognize and appreciate the art of chaos. Maybe there is something more to the chaos.

3950239,5,B002LZSVM6,"What an incredible documentary to stumble across! I've seen two other really cool documentaries on fractals (hunting the hidden dimension from pbs and the color of infinity, narrated by Arthur C. Clarke) and I would rate this as the most technical of the three. I've taken a lot of math classes as and engineer and I feel like this documentary gives it to you pretty straight. This documentary explores fractals only tangentially to the broader concept of chaos theory, which it does quite impressively. The second most awesome part of this documentary has to be the characters whom are interviewed. Other reviews have the opinion that the 1980s image quality detracts from the experience, but I feel like it instead frames the scientists being interviewed into their natural habitat in space and time. I'd go so far as to describe the cinematography (if you could call it that) endearing and appropriate, it really adds depth to the experience. And believe me, I would definitely call watching the documentary an experience. When you finish watching it, you'll feel as though you've touched the face of God, even if you are not religious.",1418515200,,1139,4.968586387434555

I spent many hours with a DOS program named ""Fractint"" generating fascinating and beautiful images.  I am not enough of a mathematician or physicist to fully comprehend the implications of chaotic functions.  The DigiCom TV program ""Chaos"" explained a bit more and enhanced my appreciation and understanding of the science of chaos.  It is not loaded with a lot of super math so one will not become confused if one is not well versed in mathematics, though an understanding of basic algebra will help, but is not necessary.

This was really a great program! Well written and produced. Is order chaos, or does chaos produce order? We may ultimately never figure that one out, but for now, we are still exploring this wonderful new science called, 'Chaos'.",1378944000,3,1931,5.085173501577287
3950278,5,B002LZSVM6,"I'm not a scientist or mathematician, but this program was fascinating! It explains how man is challenging order and disorder through the use of computers, and an actual science termed, ""Chaos"". Man, for example, has tried to control the weather, but found that he cannot - weather is simply too big a thing to control. The European Weather Center is the world's largest weather center, and in order for them to predict a 10-day weather forecast in advance, it takes three hours and 400 million computer calculations per second to predict what the weather is going to do over the next 10 days.

The rules of chaos are universal. ""Period Doubling"", for example, is characteristic of some systems making a transition to chaos. Doubling is followed by quadrupling, etc. An example of a map displaying period doubling is the logistic map. This program also explores fractal triangles. A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal dimension that usually exceeds its topological dimension and may fall between the integers. Fractals are typically self-similar patterns, where self-similar means they are ""the same from near as from far"". Fractals may be exactly the same at every scale, or, they may be nearly the same at different scales. The definition of fractal goes beyond self-similarity to exclude trivial self-similarity and include the idea of a detailed pattern repeating itself - like triangles within triangles.

3950279,5,B002LZSVM6,"Ok, so it's not HD. At first I was gonna find something else to watch but succumbed to my humanities-nerd fascination with the edges of science and math, since they seem often to reflect our culture's current limits in understanding knowledge and reality themselves.

So glad I let it play! Although it made me feel a bit old--one of my first jobs involved interacting with a hulking mainframe computer less powerful than the ipod currently in my pocket--it was still informative in a way that I was not quite expecting when I saw the old TV-proportioned square on my screen. Like most nerds, I have known about chaos theory for a long time and of course have more than one screensaver based on fractals and/or strange attractors, but I had never investigated any of it thoroughly enough to understand, for instance, what a strange attractor might represent.

And now I think I do! Or, I see what it was said to have represented in 1985 or so.

This film explains the mathematical structures found in chaotic processes without using very much math at all; if you can understand what happens when you multiply something by two several times in a row, you'll have no trouble comprehending the demonstrations here.

A personal quirk: I was also pleasantly surprised that nobody claimed that any of these structures imply some sort of ""deep order"" to chaos, and in fact at the very beginning the narrative emphasizes on the degree of complexity in real-life chaotic systems and the limits that complexity can create for ideals of comprehensive knowledge. I love documentaries but I hate when they insult me with hasty platitudes. This one didn't!",1377820800,,1642,4.853571428571429
3950280,5,B002LZSVM6,"as the documentary will hint, and a bit of Googleing and Wikipediaing will affirm, Lorenz and Mandelbrot are both central figures in the math/science of chaos.  yeah, it's old... but i simply loved, like really loved, the power of the computer spiel at the beginning of the documentary that panned to an old school IBM when, you know, IBM still made computers.  with floppy disks! :-)

so yeah, it's also in 4:3 aspect ratio, which might look a little weird if like me, you rarely watch anything on TV, but when you do you try to find something that be new and shiny and (in my case, at least) in 1080p at 24fps.

regardless of (due to?) the old schoolness of the thing, this documentary is awesome.  did i mention they interview Lorenz? that you get to see him hold the actual printout from the simulations he ran with different numbers of significant digits that led to the foundation of Chaos theory?  did i mention they also interview Mandelbrot; you know, he's like the guy behind all the pretty pictures of fractals you've been seeing your whole life?  well they do!  and it's awesome.  there's even a bit with a swirly liquidy slash metal suspended thing (i think metal; i seem to be thinking aluminium) that some technical minded folks down in texas built to explore the nature of waves and went on to find some rather cool stuff about how chaos 'steps' up to different levels or types of chaos.  i mean come on, they throw you some swirly silver stuff too!  is this not already more than you had expected?

in all seriousness, great documentary.  i only wish it was in glorious high def and in 16:9. but, that would like require a time machine or something (a hot tub maybe?).",1376870400,19,1685,4.521452145214521

However this documentary does an excellent job by including a generous number of visualizations. Interview clips with explanations from some of the pioneers of chaos theory (Mandelbrot and Edward Lorenz) were helpful as well.

Judging from the computers and general attire, this film probably aired in the late 80's. Fortunately it's a non-issue because the concepts haven't changed!",1374624000,,481,5.413333333333333

As this film was produced decades ago, there's no heavy reliance on animation and ""technology"" to aid the explanatory process. Instead, viewers are treated to real-life examples of period doubling and feedback loops that could be reproduced at home. It plays more like a weekend feature than a documentary.

The experts describe chaos very clearly. I learned about it from other sources here and there but, again, this documentary has the best handle on making the topic accessible and understandable. Highly recommend.",1518480000,,766,5.219512195121951

I would guess that it is a fairly well preserved doc from 1985-1989 (the dates mentioned are all in the latter 80s; the supercomputer shown is the Cray-1, which was 70's to early 80's technology).  While the information presented is well done and completely fascinating, the science of chaos has moved on by leaps and bounds and is no longer sort of 'fringe' or new to mainstream science.  It is now applied in any number of ways to aid us in the world and is not a curious, new area of research.  Too bad the date can't be amended to better reflect the age of this film, or at least put into the description.  It is a great intro to chaos theory and a wonderful snapshot of the early days of chaos research, so hopefully available for a long time to come.
