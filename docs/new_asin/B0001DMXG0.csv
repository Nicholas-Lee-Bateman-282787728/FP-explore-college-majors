1992360,3,B0001DMXG0,"I had no idea what to expect from this one, but it turned out to be Italy's response to the Roger Corman Edgar Allan Poe films, and it's actually pretty good.

In late 19th century northern France, lovely Emily De Blancheville returns to her ancestral home from finishing school to find that her brother has sacked the entire staff and all the new servants are creepy. Worse yet, her father - whom she had believed to be killed in a fire - is actually alive but hideously burned and criminally insane, and locked up in the tower. Her brother explains that there is a curse on the De Blancheville line, and their father believes that the curse can only be broken if Emily dies before her 21st birthday, which is coming up so close that they've already got the castle bedecked with festive balloons. Well, to make 89 minutes short, the father escapes and pretty soon Emily is in for a bad time of it.

What I liked about this film: It's produced by ""Llama Films"", which has to make a person smile. The leading ladies are all lovely, and Emily's little peekaboo nightie is extremely flattering (yeah, yeah, I know, men are pigs. Oink, oink). The location and sets are amazing, with real castles and genuine ruins (it's so cold, even indoors, that you can constantly see the actors' breath). The monster's makeup seems to be some kind of Kharis mask, Italian style. The dialog is priceless, if a tad wordy (""You will follow me, Emily. To your tomb. To your death. To die. To die. To die. To die""). Have I mentioned it was produced by Llama Films? Oh, and the brother (""Roderick"", what else) is played by a guy who looks like Vincent Price. At least, in the context of this film. There are a lot of other shenanigans, with a doctor who is not what he appears, a housekeeper who is exactly what she appears, a premature burial, et al, but I don't like to give away too much of the plot. Sometimes, you have to just let the film run its course and try not to think about what it all means for months, or even years.

THE BLANCHEVILLE MONSTER DVD from Alpha Video is a soft print, unletterboxed but seemingly complete. The film was shot in B&W, so don't think you're missing any color here.",1109462400,17,2182,4.43640897755611
8010856,3,B0001DMXG0,"There's a minor plot point I will spoil early in this review.  I don't think many people will care (considering this is an obscure, old film), but since some cinephiles are adamant about avoiding plot spoilers, I thought I should mention it.

""The Blancheville Monster"" (sometimes known as The Blancheville Horror) may be the first monster movie I've seen that doesn't actually involve a monster, not in the typical horror-movie-sense of the word at least.  I wanted to hate it as a result but just can't.  While it appears to be a horror movie on the surface it turns out to be more of a suspense tale (a thin distinction perhaps, but a distinction nonetheless).  I think having the proper expectations of what will be delivered in it will likely make it more enjoyable for new viewers.

Emily de Blancheville is returning to her family's homestead, a very large and very old estate, to visit her brother.  Many things have changed since Emily left for school, and the place is creepy more than homely now.  The ominous atmosphere may have something to do with the supposed monster in the tower, a monster that thinks Emily must die before her next birthday in order to lift a curse from the Blancheville family.  Emily's friends try to protect her, but they can't save her from descending into an indefinable illness.  Can those that love her stop the thing that threatens her life, and if so what effect will that have on the supposed family curse?  What secrets do the new housekeeper and family doctor harbor?

It's a story that doesn't always go in  a predictable direction. For some this is going to be a good thing; for others, when what they want to happen doesn't, it might be more disappointing.  While not necessarily one that keeps the viewer on the edge of a seat it does manage to be interesting and entertaining.  The plot creates a pleasant suspense, and the castle with its foggy grounds around it generates a creepy atmosphere that lends a lot to the overall effect.

The acting is fair enough: nothing to write home about but good enough to keep the story alive. What helps is that their characters try to keep the viewer guessing.  Will Emily be the innocent victim or the bold heroine?  Whose motives are pure and who has hidden agendas?  Then, of course, there's the secret of the monster and its ties to the Blancheville family.

The result is uncertainty and an ominous air.  We are not scared by the monster, only kept in suspense as the mysteries unfold.  We aren't shocked by grisly murders though perhaps some will be disturbed by the lengths to which the villains will go.

Being an Italian movie the dubbing can be a little disorienting.  If you can look past that and want some good old black-and-white suspense tale this is worth a moment of your time.

Content:
There is little of note in this movie as is common with old black and white movies.  It has no sex, nudity, or strong language, and the violence is infrequent and mild.  There aren't much in the way of scares, either.  So this is probably a good movie for younger viewers that like haunting tales.

DVD:
Ive seen this in 2 different mega-movie 50 packs: Chilling Classics and Fright Classics. The image is pretty messy being trashy, shaky, jumpy, smudgy, and not very sharp. The audio is slightly distorted with a good amount of white noise, but the dialogue is easily understandable. The two prints look and sound about the same. There are no extras offered for either.

There are a few other DVD editions to choose from including a 50th Anniversary that has positive comments on the quality. This particular one promotes the movie as Edgar Allan Poes Horror, but connections to Poes writings are cursory at best. Other DVD options don't appear to offer anything more than what I described above.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
While I don't necessarily highly recommend ""The Blancheville Monster"" I do think it's worth some effort to see by fans of older suspense movies.  It's definitely one of the better old Italian movies I've seen.  As long as you don't mind the dubbing or weak audio and visual quality, and aren't looking for a real monster horror movie, you could do a lot worse than this one. Dont spend much on a DVD because you're probably not getting good quality, but look into the 50th Anniversary edition if you're going for anything other than the cheapest option. Ill give the movie 3*.",1518480000,,4387,4.677966101694915
8010857,3,B0001DMXG0,"1884 France.  ""I'm home at last!  My exile has ended!""  Poor Emily De Blancheville, her troubles are just beginning.  First, her home is a creepy castle poorly furnished.  Second, her welcoming brother Rodrigue is a tad sinister and not a little austere.  Third, all her favorite servants have been swapped out for unreasonable facsimiles of people.  It's a good thing she thought to bring along some company in the form of a dutiful suitor and his sister Alice.  Because there is no fun to be had at home!  Their father may or may not be dead.  There are howls in the night.  Creepy brother Rodrigue is given to playing creepy music.  And then a really-really-really icky doctor shows up.  He stares knowingly at Miss Eleonore the gruesome housekeeper, who in turn stares knowingly at Rodrigue who just stares.  The menace is so gosh darn thick you'd have to use an axe to cut it.  It isn't long before a ghastly apparition of sorts is giving poor Emily bad ideas, like go out to your tomb and get in it.  The silly sap is ever so obliging and keeps heading out there in the muck and mire.  Everyone is constantly saving her from herself until they no longer can.  Can poor Emily be under a spell or the victim of the family curse/prophecy?  Will she ever find happiness or will she end up buried alive?  Watch out for falling stones, someone wants her dead.

There are enough red herrings to serve up a pretty good meal.  I was even starting to get suspicious of Emily!!!  If you like old creaky Gothic suspense chillers, you might like this one.  I found it adequately entertaining, curious enough to see it through to the bitter end.  Won't bother watching it again though.  It was just too predictable and heavy-handed.  It could have used a major star or two and much better dialog.  Otherwise, it was okay.",1430956800,,1813,4.546583850931677
8010858,4,B0001DMXG0,"Yes, my friends. The Italian Horror Gothic Movie returns! And oh, what a treat! Though the European Queen Of Horror Barbara Steele isn't present in this Gothic Delight, you still get a hideous Monster, beautiful women gone mad, dream sequences, shadowy corridors, madman playing the organ at night and much more for such a good price! I recomend this as a follow-up Movie to ""Black Sunday"" with Barbara Steele. That way, you can make your own ""Gothic Italiana Marathon"" night!",1372550400,3,476,4.9625
8010859,1,B0001DMXG0,"I'm a fan of campy,spooky,castle movies. This just doesn't make it. Even Ed Wood's classics would win an oscar compared to this stinker.

8010860,5,B0001DMXG0,"I'd heard of this film for years before finally seeing it recently on DVD.  For genre fans, it is a delight.

On display here are marvelous locations (an authentic castle, forests in late autumn, tombs in ancient crumbling abbey) and mood music.  The costumes are also perfect and a great compliment to the expertly coffeted (and agreeable) cast.

The story concerns a young woman's homecoming to the family castle on the eve of her 21st birthday.  However, her father--hideously disfigured in a fire--is now mad and on the loose, determined to kill her to prevent an ancient curse's fruition.

Besides the film's great atmosphere, the real appeal here are the excellent manners of the characters. Completely alien in a 21st century world of Jerry Springer and ghetto-worship, they are letter perfect and a delight to behold.

A good bet for your Halloween-season viewing.",1314662400,3,872,5.055944055944056
8010861,4,B0001DMXG0,"This film and a lot of the cast were unfamiliar to me, and I'm a horror fanatic, so I assume that most of you never heard of it and maybe found it on someone's list or you searched the word monster to get to this page. It is reminiscent of other gothic horror films, but I say that in the best of terms. The settings are cold and sterile which adds to the creepiness. It starts off a little slow with Emily returning from school, but it's kind of cool because everyone else is acting so weird and you only know as much as she does. Keeping the viewer in the dark as to what is going on, puts you into the lead character's position. Then, when you think the strangeness has been explained, suddenly the cast starts acting odd again. You are never put at ease for the heroine's safety and everything about the ending was pretty surprising. Suspenseful horror movies, and old Twilight Zone episodes, can be fun to watch when you don't know why everyone is acting so strange. You and perhaps the lead character are the only ones who aren't in on the joke or riddle or curse in the case of the Blancheville Monster. This DVD is always low priced and worth adding to your collection if you like horror or suspense films.",1288051200,2,1214,4.328947368421052
8010862,5,B0001DMXG0,"What can I say?  This movie was an all time favorite of mine.  I first saw this film on the ""Moona Lisa Show""  in the 1960s.  It has always haunted me and as an adult I never got to see it again........that is until Amazon quickly reminded me of my youth and SCARES.  Great movie to watch with popcorn and an open mind!  A MUST SEE !",1209168000,2,333,3.8955223880597014
8010863,3,B0001DMXG0,"Though it has somehow or other managed to escape all the standard reference books, this film is a real and unheralded discovery--a visually distinguished and absorbing Gothic thriller, halfway between Bava country and the Mexican gothics like ""The Witch's Mirror"".

""Blancheville Monster"" where have you been hiding? Right off the bat, we are treated to a deliciously evocative visual opening--a wintry, bare tree ridden country road, awash with an icy looking rain, beyond which stands the distant castle on the mountain.

Anne Radcliffe would be well pleased! And the film keeps on delivering: two attractive female leads, a mysterious and scarred man locked in a tower room, frequent thunder and lightning, and all the necessary accoutrements of remote castle Gothic, from flickering torches to doleful turns on the family harpsichord.

The countryside in which the film is shot has the desolate beauty of a November day, and strongly suggests the Brittany in which the film is set, (though not shot). In this sense, some of the landscapes resemble those in Bresson's ""Diary of a Country Priest."" Devotees of the genre are herewith advised to seek this out. It's far more deserving than some of its over-hyped relatives.",1184544000,6,1223,5.197969543147208
8010864,5,B0001DMXG0,"Young, innocent sweet Emily De Blancheville returns home to her creepy family castle to celebrate her 21st birthday, which, unknown to her, is destined not to happen. A family curse has driven her disfigured father insane and he plans to murder Emily, hence the plot which I won't give away.

This film was shot (in b&w) during the fall/winter (no snow yet no leaves). It's cold, creepy & very gothic with lots of artsy camera shots, especially during the premature burial scene, reminiscent of Dreyer's VAMPYR.

The acting is very good with both the brother and the doctor giving their best Vincent Price impersonations. And the maid is the real hottie, in a perverse sort of way.

A very nice entry into the Euro-Gothic-Horror genre, well done and very enjoyable, and the ALPHA dvd is quite good as well, very watchable and most likely a complete print.

You even get to see brother Roderick play Bach's Toccata and Fugue during one of his moodier moments. Now what can be more gothic than that?

Recommended viewing.",1177632000,10,1019,4.8
8010865,4,B0001DMXG0,"The Blancheville Monster is a pretty decent little Gothic thriller directed by Alberto de Martino; also called Horror, this Spanish-Italian film takes us down well-worn paths but proves interesting and effectively suspenseful toward the end.  Seemingly filmed, at least in part, in an authentic old castle (but I could be wrong about that), the gloomy atmosphere makes for a perfect backdrop for this story of deception, murder, and the obligatory family curse.  The Blancheville family, you see, will end with the current generation - at least, that's what the curse/prophecy says.  Young Emily knows nothing of this legend, however, as she returns home to the family estate in Brittany accompanied by Alice, her best friend from college, and Alice's brother John (who is, of course, quite in love with Emily).  Emily soon finds herself a bit ill at ease, as the place has changed since she last saw it.  Her brother Roderick is there to welcome her, but all of the old servants have been replaced by new ones, and - more importantly - Emily's father, the Count, has recently died in a fire.  Still, everything seems okay on the surface, except for a suspicious doctor who has seemingly perfected the art of giving meaningful looks to others.  During that first night, Alice is awakened by the sounds of someone screaming and decides to investigate, and that is when things start to get a lot more interesting.

It turns out that the old Count isn't dead after all - just horribly disfigured in the fire.  Emily doesn't know whether to be happy or sad about the news.  She faces no similar dilemma with what she learns next, however, as her brother Roderick reluctantly informs her that her father, the Count, is determined to kill her, believing that the only way to escape the family curse is for the female of the youngest generation to die before her 21st birthday.  Did I mention dear old dad has escaped?  Or the fact that Emily's 21st birthday is less than a week away?  Lying around waiting for your horribly disfigured father to pop up and kill you at any moment can be a tad stressful on a young lady.

Everyone grows concerned as Emily deteriorates physically and spiritually.  You would think someone (especially the man who dreams of marrying her) would keep a constant watch over her, not only to guard her from attack but also to keep her from sort of sleep-walking down to the family crypt every night, but no one does any such thing.  As the fateful day of her 21st birthday approaches, the sense of impending tragedy grows ever stronger.  Will Emily live to enjoy her new-found love?  Is her father really trying to kill her - or could it be someone else who wants her dead?  You don't have to look far to find a few definite suspects.  Diverse elements work together to keep the film suspenseful until the very end.

I definitely consider The Blancheville Monster to be something of a gem among low-budget thrillers.  It drags in spots, thanks to too much melodramatic dialogue, and it certainly doesn't break a lot of new ground (the influence of Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher is obvious enough without naming Emily's brother after Roderick Usher), but I quite enjoyed it from start to finish.  The acting is above average, the atmosphere has an authentic Gothic look and feel to it, and the basic storyline never loses its focus.",1150934400,10,3358,4.731958762886598
