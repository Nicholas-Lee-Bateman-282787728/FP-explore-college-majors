8288710,1,B001CQS7KQ,"This is one of the worst documentaries ever made. Primarily about Radcliffe and mostly consists of people talking about him... so if you hear 30 seconds of Radcilffe himself speak that's about it -- as for watching him act, rehearse, or even get direction from a director, forget it.... the commentary is overwhelmingly uninteresting, poor and irritating as well very very very repetitive.",1453680000,,389,5.190476190476191
8288711,4,B001CQS7KQ,"It says 'kids', but the only person they were interested in was Daniel.  Emma rated a little more time than Rupert.  This should have been listed as a JK Rowling/Daniel Radcliffe Bio, with a bit thrown in on the others.  That's too bad, as I wanted it for Rupert.",1410912000,,263,4.326530612244898

8288715,4,B001CQS7KQ,"I love the Harry Potter Kids DVD, but it wasn't long enough. After all these years, you'd think there'd be more info about the actors.",1344988800,2,134,4.4
8288716,5,B001CQS7KQ,"This video is geared towards adults rather than kids. It gives the background of how Daniel Radcliffe and the actors for Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley were chosen as well as other info on the choice of the producer. I found it very interesting. It would not be likely, however, to interest kids.",1297900800,6,298,4.6415094339622645

8288718,3,B001CQS7KQ,"I was really looking forward to seeing this DVD and watched it the day I got it.  However, I was disappointed in how the show was put together.  I expected a Biography show to be excellent.  I would say the different speakers (I do not know any of them) who were an author, a film critic (I think), etc. were very well spoken and had a lot of interesting things to say - very professional.  BUT...to show the same exact photos over and over and over and over (sometimes cropped to show just one or two people) -- like some cheap reality show showing the same accident over an over again - not very good.

This was called ""Harry Potter Kids"" (plural) but mostly talked about Daniel Radcliffe. The DVD had about 31 min. about the popularity of Harry Potter books, J. K. Rowling (not so much), some about the director Chris Columbus, but MOSTLY about Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and less than 13 minutes was devoted to Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Herminone Grainger) - what experience they did not have before Harry Potter, how they Emma wasn't really cute or anything but that Emma was such a ""good girl"" - none of the ""kids"" had gone bad and that Daniel had done a well known play (Equus) where he appears nude and is in a love making scene - he can act in other areas besides Harry Potter -- so he was happy.

The case for the DVD says the run time is ""approximately 50 minutes"" but it is actually only 44 minutes.  I guess I should have known better since it was a TV broadcast with commercials from 2008 so it could not be 50 minutes. There were no extras - just chapters you could choose.

I would recommend the recent ABC broadcast show, ""J.K. Rowling, A Year in the Life Of"" that was broadcast July 16, 2009.  Now THAT was interesting!  AND I found out that it included in the newest 2 disc regular DVD set, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-Two-Disc-Limited-Special-Edition/dp/B000ZECQ08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Two-Disc Limited Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the Blu-Ray (2 disc) version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B000ZELISO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>]",1247875200,39,2406,5.375
8288719,5,B001CQS7KQ,"I purchased this DVD after seeing the program on television.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, of both the books and movies.  I really enjoyed this show, and I'm not a huge fan of the whole Biography series in general.  If you like the Harry Potter movies or are just a fan of these talented teenagers, you'll like this DVD.",1238371200,12,320,4.3
