221871,5,6300185230,"Although I'd worn make-up for years prior, I never really knew how to do it right until I saw this video when it was new.  I recently purchased a used copy of it, primarily for nostalgia purposes but also thinking I could use a refresher; but I was surprised to find how well the instruction had stuck with me.  While some trends change (I wouldn't use bright blue and pink eye shadow today) I am still applying my make-up in exactly this fashion and it still works.  This is easy, anybody can do it with very little practice, and it will look terrific on you.  Obviously this is long out of print so my advice to anyone looking for a good make-up video would be to grab this up fast if you can find it.",1193616000,4,703,4.185185185185185

7804560,4,6300185230,"I have the VHS Tape I purchased in 1988 from Woolworths.  I wish they would put this on a DVD as, not many of us have a VHS Player anymore.  Anyway, this tape if very informative and although a little outdated (blue and pink eyeshadow and lining under your eyes), it has some very good makeup and skin care tips.  Donna Mills is still a beautiful woman and looks far younger than her years.",1488758400,,390,4.243243243243243

7804562,5,6300185230,"I was so happy to find this out of print video.  The beauty tips and instructions for replicating Donna Mills' famous eye makeup techniques are still useful.  I saw some recent photos of her and she continues to look great--even at age 75.  She looked natural and did not appear to have been ""nipped and tucked"" to a caricature of her younger self--like so many of the actresses of her age now do.  Those beauty techniques of hers must really work.",1433980800,,448,4.493827160493828

7804566,4,6300185230,"This 1986 video is certainly a mixed (makeup) bag of crazy colors and 80s techniques but it's also extremely entertaining and you might learn a thing or two.
Donna Mills (Knots Landing) takes you on a step-by-step process of applying your makeup for day, business and night as well as giving tips on how to care for your skin.  Considering she was about 43 when she made this video and has such beautiful skin tone, I would say she knows a thing or two about taking care of her skin.

The helpful:
-She makes good suggestions about lighting and where to apply your makeup for best effect.
-Suggestions on specific colors to use for various eye colors.
-Good tips on how to use your foundation.
The hilarious:
-80s colors for eyes.  Copious amounts of iridescent pink and blue... and you're ready to disco...in broad daylight.
-The modeling of big-shouldered clothes she does in the middle of this tape which is apropos to nothing.

Your eyes may have it after watching this video but you also won't believe your eyes when you see how much eye makeup Ms. Mills is putting on.  Watching the close up, I thought, my God, she's going to look like a clown; and then when they panned back...she just looked beautiful.  But frankly, she was beautiful in spite of some of the things she was doing.  The under-eyeliner was so thick and smudged, most of us would look like raccoons.
Just on makeup tips alone, I would give this three stars since so much of it is dated.  But on entertainment value, I give this five stars.  This would be great fun for girls at a slumber party or a group of women who want to have a drink and enjoy some 80s fun.  Donna Mills has such a wonderful, calming voice, too, so this strange little tape almost becomes hypnotic.  It's hilarious and soothing , all at the same time.

A bonus for me, a real ""Knots Landing"" fan, is that one of the main characters shows up at the end of this video.  It's really good fun.  You may not get the makeup tips you're looking for with this unless you're wanting to time travel back to the 80s (which doesn't sound like a bad idea to me sometimes), but you'll pick up a tip or two.  And while the stunning Ms. Mills is putting on her face, you will put on a happy face because this is entertaining in a way that was unexpected.",1398038400,2,2283,4.389548693586699
7804567,5,6300185230,"Donna Mills at age 70+ still is one of the most beautiful women on TV.  I have been using these techniques ever since receiving my tape, and let's just say the compliments have been non-stop--and no, I don't hang around with people stuck in the 80's!!",1361232000,6,251,4.456521739130435
7804568,5,6300185230,"""The Eyes Have It"" is the very best tape I have ever seen about putting make up on.  Donna Mills shows you all of her tricks to make a woman look pretty.  Did you know that she does her own make up at all times?  If any one wants to look good at all times, this is the tape they should get.  It's easier to learn from looking at this tape than learning from a book.  This is the 2nd time I've purchased this tape because the 1st was destroyed from hurricane Katrina; so it is really that good.  Most very sincerely, Bertie Gros",1243814400,3,527,4.019230769230769
