1841787,5,B00008EYBH,"I'm definetly buying this show on DVD when it comes out. The first four seasons are my favourite. Especially season 1. It rules.

Reruns of this show were taken out of syndication shortly after the series itself came to an end in the mid 1980s. The show's reruns came back on TV in 1998,but not for long.

One Day At A Time rocks! I can hardly wait until April.",1174003200,8,361,4.217391304347826
1841788,5,B00008EYBH,"I am thrilled to see this classic 70's sitcom finally get a bonifide dvd release!!! Wow! I can't wait to hear the theme song and sing along!!! One Day at a Time gave single mothers a voice, by showing that a woman could make it on her own as a single parent after divorce. Naturally, Norman Lear was the creative force behind this hit show, which doesn't surprize me, considering his other classic tv shows All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Goodtimes, and my all-time favorite Maude ruled the 1970's!!!

 Now fans finally get to revisit Anne Romano, Julie, Barbara, and Schnieghter bring on the laughter!!! I'm also glad the reunion special will be included in the dvd set as well and everyone looked great!!!",1172448000,31,710,4.672

Revolutionary for the times (a single mother raising two kids on her own), ODAAT is funny, silly, and keeping you hooked from week to week.  The quality and the issue-based hilarity is the string that binds the old and at the new version. Unfortunately, future seasons aren't available yet so ....

1842049,2,B00008EYBH,"When divorce is now a common--and 'mainstream' thing, the entire season of this Norman Lear series won't seem 'new'. We do need to look at it in the context of it's own era.

Ann Romano's (Bonnie Franklin's) apartment actually looks like something which today's struggling (and) starving artist would shack themselves up in. It is a complete rat hole. Single-mothers, regardless of ethnicity or prior education just did not earn a lot back then at all. Ann's in a dwelling which looks like my college dorm room.

It would have been unrealistic to put her in a nice house in the suburbs or a luxury townhouse while raising two young girls. Striking it out on their own was not appropriate social conduct. And so they were punished for the divorce.

Not to mention the `interesting' people who always seemed to be around. Such as building superintendent Harrington. He does not look or act like any of the apartment staff I've ever had to deal with. Nobody in their current mind would find this quirky or cute on a regular basis-even with limited income.

All of the episodes are included. The only episode which I really did not like were ""Dad comes back part 2"". The daughters are supposed to be teenagers. However, they genuinely don't comprehend that a divorce means their parents marriage is over for good. There will be no remarriage. This specific episode would not show well on any current TV affiliates--including cable. Most current American teenagers have comprehension skills to figure out that a divorce means that a marriage is over for good.

People should be thankful for the DVD release. Other than online, this is likely the only way to get to see the episodes ever again. Since so much of the series is very dated in this respect, I'm not even sure if additional season released would be viable as a DVD release.

The studios would not have music to work through. They do have to convince themselves that antiquated ideas about gender roles/divorce laws still make an entertaining and even profitable market purchase.

Would enough of today's audiences be able to relate to the plotlines--which specifically do center around that era's ideas of divorce. Since this is the thrust of the show, it does not  transition well over into 21st century entertainment. Sorry.",1405123200,2,2282,4.848329048843188

1842053,5,B00008EYBH,"One Day at a Time was on for nine seasons, and never lost its focus or momentum, will updating the format and content and characters just enough each season to keep it entertaining and funny!  This introductory season is not only funny, but insightful.  It was one of the first, if not THE first to show something we all knew and probably had contact with back then -- a single mother raising her family in a male-centric society, at least as far as working goes.  With humor, this series illustrated the challenges without shoving it in our face, and allowing us to laugh for 23 minutes a week at something we were probably all too familiar with in one way or another.

If this season didn't sell well enough to encourage the release of further seasons, that's not only a shame, but baffling as well.  This is a great show, with a great start.  This season is well worth buying.  I say, go buy your copy NOW!!!",1398729600,12,911,4.419161676646707

1842107,5,B00008EYBH,"I have to admit that I was a fan of One Day at a Time. Mostly, I remember them in syndication where the show aired at least once a day for weeks at a time. The first season introduced us to a newly independent Ann Romano Cooper who goes by Ann Romano with her two teenage daughters, Julie (Mackenzie Phillips) and Barbara Cooper (Valerie Bertinelli). The show was groundbreaking in terms of Maude and other Norman Lear sitcoms. Although, Ann isn't related or connected to any of the other shows.

One Day at a Time showed a divorced woman and her daughters adjusting to life in a new city like Indianapolis, Indiana. The building has Ann's boyfriend and neighbor, David Kane (played by Richard Mazur). I really liked Ann's relationship with David and was sad to see it end by the second season. The first season was a mid-season replacement with only 15 episodes and the documentary in the 30 year reunion.

I loved Schneider as the nosy building Super. The show was not just groundbreaking but realistic in thanks to creators Alan Manings and his wife, Whitney Blake. The show was a first about women's independence. The show couldn't have picked a better actress than Bonnie Franklin to play Ann Romano. Her performance was always real without being silly or over the top. Her onscreen daughters were also realistic in performance and appearance.

Shows like One Day at A Time don't happen anymore. Sitcoms today are silly, offensive, and unrealistic too. Groundbreaking sitcoms don't happen anymore because there is little ground to break nowadays. Lear sitcoms like One Day at A Time dealt with social issues like suicide, drunk driving, pre-marital sex, divorce, and other issues as part of daily life. They also showed a conscious at the public level where people were once free to disagree about those issues and it was okay.",1366156800,7,1832,4.809523809523809

1842153,5,B00008EYBH,"I fell in love with Valerie Bartineli on this show. I am only 2 years older than she is and she looked so much like my girlfriend at the time who later became my wife and mother of my children. (We would eventually divorce as well.) So I loved my girlfriend but was in love with Valerie also. Why couldn't I have them both? But, it was a good show. Bonnie Franklin was excellent in her role as a divorced mother trying to find her own identity and do the best for her and her two girls. (It really hurt when she passed) It was sprapo for the times and a very real setting. To me it marked the times and the courage of the women who finally got out from a marriage that was just not working and decided that they can make it. Divorce is never a good solution. But sometimes, and more often than not, it is the only solution. And this show made it humorous while respecting the plight of those undergoing such times. This was a show done in very good taste and showed the best side of one of life's worse realities. That Divorce can happen and everyone can survive, if they love and respect each other and stick together. And the time of the Hustle was one of this countries best times, And who could not love that airhead of a superintendent that sometimes gets it right? If they would just come out with the rest of the seasons so we can have the entire collection. Why can't they do that? What's the difficulty? I know that they must have all the original recordings in a library somewhere so that the only issue would be money. I hope they come out with them.  And soon!",1360713600,,1572,4.2052980132450335

1842170,5,B00008EYBH,"I recently purchased the dvd One Day at a Time . I was able to enjoy watching Bonnie Franklin, Pat Harrington,
and the rest of the cast. The stories are funny, touching and believable . The show I believe expresses how there
are many families who do live hard times such as the show portrays then as does now. The acting is done well.
I truly will enjoy this dvd for a long time because it I think it sends a very good message for different situations
and has a touch of humor which I think is important to have.

1842171,4,B00008EYBH,have enjoyed them  the sound is low and high at times but I think that is the way it was filmed back then. but still was a good show,1335657600,,132,3.5517241379310347
1842172,4,B00008EYBH,"The only reason this show should get a good rating is for the nostalgic feelings of life in the late 70s/early 80s it evokes. That is really the main reason I watch this show and why I like it. It is so bad and outdated and quaint that it is really good again.

Bonnie Franklin is a cutsie and has spunk but she was just out of place and seemed too boyish, independent and too young to be believable as a mother of teens. I just didn't see the connection there and she didn't have much chemistry with her daughters  both of whom seem miscast, especially Phillips. Their relationships kinda felt fake, the jokes were flat and there was just no connection. Franklin's character's aspirations to be independent and respected as a woman also always seemed so superficially addressed and worked out. That is because the show goes from being a situation comedy to drama within minutes back and forth, creating a comedy-drama. One minute it is comedy and jokes,  then 2 minutes later they pan in on the faces and a serious issue is being talked about, then it's back to rom-com. I say just pick something and stick with it. I found that back and forth irritating and it wasn't very cleverly done.

Another issue is the acting which at times is really bad. nearly everyone in this show is miscast or they are miscast with each other. I really had a hard time believing Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) was a mother. The actors just don't inhabit their roles and they don't have chemistry. Everything feels too rehearsed. The guest stars were almost always horrible actors, like the daughter's boyfriends. Awful. I couldn't stop laughing cause they were just so so bad that it was amusing watching them, wondering how they ever passed that audition. I don't know what they were thinking.

Finally, I don't understand why Schneider, of all people, has been elevated to such a status and is featured on covers. All he does is drop in every now and then and crack lame jokes or remarks and leave. He is not particularly funny nor interesting and his purpose for this show, especially since his role is reduced to that of mere comic relief, eludes me.

Overall, though, I think the nostalgia of the 70s this show evokes more than makes up for all the issues mentioned above. All the faults and cheesiness make this show endearing rather than annoying and if you go into it with that understanding it will be fun. I still enjoyed watching it and it was interesting to see the issues people in the 70s struggled with and how daring this show was in a way for attempting to address these issues even though it all still felt very lighthearted and quirky. Hollywood is always ahead of mainstream when it comes to a lot of social liberal issues; the medium of film allows for such a possibility and this show was part of that industry. Anyway this is a fun show if you can put yourself back to a different time where life took place at a different pace.",1324598400,,2931,4.541666666666667

For some apparent reason, I must have loved this show, also.  But as I watched it, the first season, wow, was I on drugs or what?  This show sucks.  Sorry.  Have to be blunt about this one.  It is overacted, totally unbelievable and just plain not funny.  I give it 2 stars because it took a lot of guts for this group of actors to lower themselves to do this show.",1260489600,,518,4.09
1842177,5,B00008EYBH,"This was (with ""The Rockford Files"") my favorite TV show from the 70s.  It is still topical and wonderfully entertaining.  Too bad the other seasons are not available.",1256601600,,167,4.928571428571429
1842217,4,B00008EYBH,"Back, when I was a kid, growing up in the '70s, my family and I pretty much loved most of the Norman Lear produced comedies, that were on the b**b tube at the time. ""All in the Family"" was king in our household, but a close second for us, would have to be the groundbreaking sitcom, ""One Day at a Time"".

For those who don't know, ""One Day at a Time"" featured Ms. Ann Ramano (Bonnie Franklin) a middle aged mom, who is newly divorced after a long time marriage. This is truely the first time in her life, that Ann hasn't been dependent on a man. She is now facing an uncertain new future, which includes finding a job and raising her two battling, teenage daughters, Julie (Mackenzie Phillips) and Barbara (Valerie Bertinelli) the best way she knows how. Along for the ride is both the meddling, wise-cracking, apartment building handyman, Dwayne F. Schnieder (Pat Harrington Jr.) and the teddy bear-like, divorce lawyer/love interest, David Kane (Richard Masur).

This was the first successful show on TV to really broach the topic of divorce and how it affected both women and kids alike. The scripts were sharp, sometimes moving and quite funny. The show made stars out of the four main cast members (I had a huuuuge, pre-teen crush on Valerie Bertinelli!), who really invested their characters with both personality and chemistry.

This DVD features all 15 episodes of the first season. The remastering is fine, but nothing special. The one extra included is a wonderful 40 minute, 2005 'reunion special', which features the principal cast members. In a relaxed setting, the actors talk and reminisce about their characters, the series' various themes & plotlines and the actual production of the show. Topics of interest run the gamut from the wild '70s clothing/hairdo fashions to a discussion of Mackenzie Phillips' drug problems, that lead to her eventually leaving the show. The actors good naturely banter back and forth, leaving the impression, that after more than 30 years, they are in a way still a family.

A great show! Highly recommended! Hopefully in the future more seasons will be released to DVD!",1221091200,5,2117,4.85595567867036

Bonnie Franklin is dynamite as the courageous, independent, divorced mom of two and many of the story lines are just as relevant now as they were in the 70s. The acting is superb, better than many of the new tv shows on today where everyone acts alike and nobody can deliver a punchline.

Yes, the rest of the cast is wonderful as well but you can't count
out the performances of these 2 young actors in the show. They are nothing like what is stated in the review I am speaking of. Watch for yourself and you'll see they are both very talented, especially, for non-seasoned actors/comedians.

1842249,5,B00008EYBH,"I love ""One Day at a Time."" This show is pure seventies. Such a quality show because all the storylines and acting always seemed so real. This was a very rare TV sitcom, because it always had a relevant message (that women didn't need a man around to feel important) while still always being very funny.

My favorite actress and character was Julie Cooper (played by the legendary, Mackenzie Phillips.) Julie was always so pretty and funny. Julie always managed to push her mother's buttons because she would never give up and was always very headstrong. Picture Kimberly (from ""Diff'rent Stroke"") with a devilish streak! And I am so proud of Mackenzie for cleaning up her act and not succumbing to the same demons that tragically took Dana's young life, way before her time.

Season One introduces us to Ann Romano (played by the awesome, Bonnie Franklin) and her two girls, Julie and Barbara Cooper (Valerie Bertinelli.) The series begins as Ann and her daughters forge forward to start a new life together, right after she leaves her husband. To borrow the words of Mrs. Rodham Clinton, Annie wasn't some ""Tammy Wynette standing by her man."" Nope! She didn't need any man. And, Annie was a hot mama, I don't think she ever wore a braw during Season One.

We also meet Schneider (Pat Harrington Jr.,) the building's handyman and resident snoop. What can I say about Schneider that you don't already know? He was the kind of guy that acted like an old friend even though he just met Annie and her girls; he was always around when they didn't need him and never around when they did. But he was more than just a handyman, he was like a member of the family because he just fit in so perfectly, like an old driving glove that was battered and tattered. Ann also has an on-again, off-again relationship with the much younger David (Richard Masur.)

The Theme Song of ""One Day at a Time"" is by John & Nancy Berry:

This is it. This is it.
This is life, the one you get
So go and have a ball.

This is it. This is it
Straight ahead and rest assured
You can't be sure at all.

So while you're here enjoy the view
Keep on doing what you do
So hold on tight we'll muddle through
One day at a time, One day at a time.

So up on your feet. Up on your feet
Somewhere there's music playing.
Don't you worry none
We'll just take it like it comes.

One day at a time, one day at a time.
One day at a time, one day at a time.
One day at a time, one day at a time.
One day at a time, one day at a time.

The first season you get to know the characters well, Ann, Julie and Barbara have great chemistry .  Schneider the Super of their Apartment Building is hilarious.  The first season focuses a  lot on Julie and her
mother Ann and their frequent run ins. The character of Barbara is a little underused I believe. But all-in-all this is a great first season.

1842252,3,B00008EYBH,"Not sure at times how to rate this because it can often be a good-great show but just as often..cringe-worthy; so let's dice, shall we? Bonnie Franklin gives several five star performances in fact most of the scripts that revolve around her are gold, she's great... because she can act. Which brings us to the girls; ugh. Valerie Bertinelli and Mackenzie Phillips are generally grating. Their conflicts are forced and the jokes are flat. I would say both are sorely miscast in this. I know your nostalgia may not let you see it; but from new eyes I can say these two are generally a mess. Schneider on the other hand is surprisingly perfect for this show. I say surprisingly because I didn't expect his role to be so necessary, but it is and Pat Harrington is a master craftsman as a fix it man, and an actor. David is the wild card. Often funny and explosive but just as often an unnecessary tool to move the scripts (which is what I would have thought Schneider would have become).

In short, this is a fair show in short bursts but is nothing near the ""comic and 70's gem"" the extra's or the five star reviews here make it out to be. It was an ok buy but you may want to take it one disc at a time.",1181433600,19,1201,4.267543859649122

Schneider, played by Pat Harrington Jr, is a superintendent by day and a ladies man (in the day or night) keeps a close eye on Annie and her brood as does Ann's sometime companion David Kane (Richard Masur).  Look out for a young Ed Begley Jr and Suzanne Somers this season.

I enjoy the premise (though dated nowadays) of a woman in her 30's wanting to ""find herself"" after divorce. Mckenzie Phillips was always believable as a dorky, cranky, homely ""every teenager."" Valerie Bertinelli's cutsey-poo persona wears thin quickly. Bonnie Franklin, an Irish looking Jewish actress portrays Ann Romano an Italian-American. This was certainly odd casting & at times I have to ask what was Norman Lear thinking?? Aside from being very non-Italian she plays Ann as though she's attractive, sexy, & desireble, but I just don't get that either. Her (over) acting style certainly falls into the ham bone category. Why did she always have to run to the door to answer it like a mental patient??!! Schneider is the necessary buffoon for comic relief but he's OK only in small doses. The best season was #2 with Mary Louise Wilson as the sassy neighbor (and love interest for Schneider) Ginny Wroblicki. Too bad she only lasted one season! Ms. Franklin had her canned because the witty Ms. Wilson upstaged her in their scenes together. Therefore, it's no wonder why there are NO clips or ANY mention of Ms. Wilson in the reunion show.

Now with close captioning, I can now know what the song's lyrics are and how it goes.  Aside from this, the show itself is quite a collectible.  It stars Bonnie Franklin as a divorced mother Ann Romano and her two daughters Julie and Barbara (MacKenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli).  They move into a downtown Indianapolis apartment and befriend the superintendant Dwayne Schneider (Pat Harrington) and become good friends.  The show to me was quite cool because of the sometimes one liners they had in the show.  Ann Romano also meets a man David (Richard Masur) and they would soon be engaged to be married.  The one thing I could not figure out is Barbara's character.  She was Barbara Cooper and it makes me think that she might've been adopted or Ann had the name Cooper as a maiden name.

I remember watching this show as a kid and it was one of the best sitcoms of the 70's and early 80's.  I hope that Sony Pictures releases the entire series and doesn't stop after 1 or 2 seasons, like has happened to many other great shows.  It has been years since i have seen any episodes as it rarely shows in repeats, so April 24th couldn't come any faster.  Highly recommended.",1176076800,3,480,4.129032258064516

7982312,5,B00008EYBH,"""One Day At A Time"" is a show with such a great ensemble cast that the moment you see the first episode you know the chemistry is there between Bonnie Franklin and Pat Harrington as well as the rest of the cast.  Mostly, though, this first season, you will see the pains of growing up, the girls wanting to be independent and making their own decisions, the challenge of Anne Romano and reconciling her feelings with her ex-husband and her new love, her divorce lawyer, David.  This is a great show and I highly recommend the purchase to get you started on a great series.  And, it teaches us in every episode to take life ""One Day At A Time.""",1494028800,,643,4.341666666666667
