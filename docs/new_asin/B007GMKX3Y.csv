5085464,5,B007GMKX3Y,New Zealand does not get enough credit for the works that come out of their country. I love the Tribe despite not being big on dramas. Characters you love and even characters you love to hate. It is an awesome Series only wish seasons 2 - 5 were formatted for region 0,1353888000,,268,4.173076923076923
5085465,5,B007GMKX3Y,"This series has more passion that any of the sludge made in the past 12 twelve years. A rag tag bunch of misfits find hope in a bleak situation and pull through with courage and determination. For a long time the only way to get your hands on these was by bootleg. Take my advice, get them while they last and pray Shout out releases the other seasons.",1348444800,,352,4.1911764705882355
5085466,5,B007GMKX3Y,"One of my favorite shows of all time! I have been watching since season one, SO happy they are FINALLY out on DVD in region 1 format!!! took long enough ;p",1344556800,3,155,4.032258064516129
5085467,5,B007GMKX3Y,Loved this show from the first time I saw it on WAM!  I've waited for years to own it and now its here. Only wish I didn't have to buy one part of series and wait for months to buy the rest of the series. Who's idea was that?! I just wonder how long U.S. fans will have to wait for series 2 part 1?!!!,1340755200,5,301,3.6307692307692307
5085468,5,B007GMKX3Y,"Its like Dawsons Creek meets the end of the world, with alot more drama, and crazier fasion. The idea and concept of this this show iswhat drew me in. I saw it for the first time when I was in high school, and am still hooked to this day. I cant even begin to express my excitement when it was released in the US. Keep em coming! :)",1339545600,,332,3.8970588235294117
5085469,1,B007GMKX3Y,"Since the adults are all dead (except for some minor flashbacks) this leaves the whole series populated with kids.  It could have been interesting if it had been written for an adult audience --- but it seems aimed at tweens and teens.

Basically - BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGG.

Not worth buying unless you absolutely have to have it for your collection.",1338422400,,345,4.913793103448276
5085470,4,B007GMKX3Y,"I'm super nostalgic and this show reminds me of my teen years in Europe. I found a couple of episodes online and realized it's just as great watching it as an adult -although quite cheesy! I think the the premise is a great idea and I love the characters. My issue is not with the show at all. My issue is with putting it out in region one 1 26 episodes at a time. I would gladly pay for box sets of all 5 seasons. Instead I have to watch half a season every couple of months. Ridiculous! I don't know what the point of doing it this way is but it is quite annoying. This show for me actually gets 5 stars, I'm taking one off because I can't watch the whole thing!",1336089600,16,664,3.962686567164179

8516361,4,B007GMKX3Y,"I liked this series when I watched on TV years ago and, though it's a bit tacky here and there, enjoyed watching it again on DVD.  I do wish the other season would come out in U.S. format!",1442534400,,188,3.9473684210526314

8516364,5,B007GMKX3Y,I had been watching this series years ago but never caught the beginning.  It is great that it is now available for our region now.  Hope they continue to change over the following seasons,1390521600,,188,4.5
8516365,5,B007GMKX3Y,I have seen these actors in their later roles. It is cool to see these actors in earlier roles. It is a Kiwi triumph!,1386374400,,117,3.9166666666666665
8516366,5,B007GMKX3Y,I'm in love with these DVD's. Got a lot of happy memories with this show. Now if we could just get seasons 2 and 3. Not a fan of the rest.,1381017600,,138,3.4838709677419355
8516367,4,B007GMKX3Y,I love this show and I am so glad that they have released it in the U.S. The Tribe takes you to a whole new world where there are only children and young adults trying to learn how to survive. It is an awesome series and I can't wait for the rest.,1373846400,,247,3.769230769230769
8516368,4,B007GMKX3Y,"A very interesting teen soap opera, the distopian setting makes for an interesting backdrop. Glad a friend pointed this one out",1369440000,2,127,5.095238095238095
