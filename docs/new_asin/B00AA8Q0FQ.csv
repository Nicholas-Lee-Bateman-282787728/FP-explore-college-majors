5402159,5,B00AA8Q0FQ,My 5 year old and 16 year old love Monster High.  Great price for a popular item! I recommend all monster high movies!,1360800000,,118,4.130434782608695
5402160,5,B00AA8Q0FQ,"I was pleaseantly surprised by the fact that this DVD includes two features....Friday Night Frights, and Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love??. Mattel could have easily released them seperately and charged more but they chose to put them together which I think is pretty cool. Both movies come on one disc which I think makes it easier for viewing since you don't have to change it out to watch one feature or the other. I will give a small synopsis of each movie (I don't want to give too much away).

In Friday Night Frights we see the ""ghouls"" learning the power of being true to (and believing in) yourself when they take on the task of playing on the Monster High ""scream"" team in the Skulltimate Roller Maze after the guys on the team get hurt. At first the girls face opposition (tradition states only boys can play) but they never give up and eventually win the respect and support of their schoolmates and even their rivals. I like the message of this dvd .... it is totally girl power. It tells girls they can do anything and should not give in to peer pressure.

Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love is a Valentines special. It is Draculauras sweet 1600 and the girls are trying to throw her a fangtastic party....unfortunately there are a few glitches. An old flame from Draculauras past (a vampire named Valentine) and Toralei do everything in their power to cause chaos. The underlying issue is about the power of true love, and having realistic expectations about things.

Both of these movies are really cute....although personally I like Friday Night Frights a little better due to the positive messages it sends girls. Also I think Abbey steals the show with her funny jokes thrown in throughout both movies. These are movies that adults can enjoy with their kids as well. This is a good value for the money and much better then most of the kids shows out there.",1360368000,30,1861,4.565868263473054
5402161,5,B00AA8Q0FQ,"I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD combo.  I really wanted to like the movie Monster High Ghouls Rule, but was kinda disappointed.  These two movies hit it right at the top. The characters are more refined, the plots are better, and the music is nice and very catchy. Yep, I liked this one.",1360368000,,311,4.344827586206897
5402162,5,B00AA8Q0FQ,"This was the best DVD set ever for Monster High fans. Both movies were well written, and had great interesting storylines and beautiful animation. I am an adult fan, however my 9 year old god daughter is also into Monster High. These movies are clean and appropriate for young children of any age, but at the same time have enough jokes and things that will go over kid's heads to keep the adults interested.

While ""Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love"" is a romance, it is clean enough for the children, yet having your heart broken is a storyline all the adults watching can relate to.

Friday Night Frights does have a few scenes where Clawd is somewhat possessive of Draculaura and telling her what to do. It is a good opportunity to open up a dialogue with older children about healthy relationships. At the end he comes around, so younger children probably do not need this kind of talk and will just see it as a kid's movie as it is meant to be.

Highly recommended! These are two movies that Monster High fans will want to watch over and over again!",1360281600,19,1048,4.419689119170984
5402163,5,B00AA8Q0FQ,"The Monster High videos are what well meaning if ultimately unhelpful activists in the bad old days of my youth used to call one hour commercials, that is animated children's TV shows based upon an existing line of toys.  (Frankly, I never understood the alleged vast moral difference between doing this as opposed to creating the TV show FIRST and only THEN merchandising the crap out of it with dolls, action figures, boardgames, Underoos, etc., but I digress.)  What matters most is the writing, and these videos are VERY well written!

One of the things that makes the Monster High videos work so well is that the writers are gently making fun of the fashion doll mania that they are in fact trying to promote. Taking the universal American experience of High School and adding the twist of the entire student body being the children of famous monsters gives them endless possibilities for parody (and self parody, as the heroines are for the most part over the top, fashion crazed, popularity obsessed teenagers).  The animation and voice acting is no slouch, either!

Chronologically the first movie is ""Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love"", which was the 3rd TV special, in fact the Valentine's Day Special.  Draculaura, Dracula's daughter, is turning Sweet 16, hundred that is, on February 14th, and the movie starts with what turns out to be Draculaura's idea for the perfect party,... to the horror of her ghoulfriends tasked with planning something that meets her insanely high expectations, though it turns out she comes by them honestly.  It seems that 400 years ago, her first boyfriend, a vampire named Valentine, created Valentine's Day just for her, but due to a ""misunderstanding with the locals"" (explained more fully in ""Ghoul's Rule"") she and her family had to flee the Old Country before the party so EVERY birthday/Valentine's Day party since gets measured in her mind against that first one she missed.

Meanwhile, Monster High meany Toralei, miffed at not being invited to the party (because she's such a cruel jerk!), decides to get even by inviting Valentine (mimicking Draculaura's voice) to transfer to MH and renew their relationship.  Meanwhile, current Draculaura boyfriend, Clawd Wolf, facing similarly insanely high expectations, is walking the disaster strewn Path of ""Practical Gifts"".  After discovering that Draculaura is in real danger, and after C.A. Cupid misses the mark, quite literally, it is up to Draculaura's ghoulfriends to salvage a happy ending.  Gently Pushed Moral: Given the choice, dump the Fantasy in favor of the Real.

Chronologically the second movie is ""Friday Night Frights"", which was the 5th TV special.  This is the story of how the MH version of Roller Derby (or is that Rollerball?) became coed after long tradition of male only teams, despite the fact that the first Skulltimate Roller Maze superstar a century ago was a girl, the mysteriously vanished Robecca Steam. Opening a year hence with the current coed team about to hit the floor, the movie flashes back a year to the Gravel City Gargoyles beating the MH team by cheating, which injured coach and best player Clawd Wolf (along with several other players) so badly that he's out for the season, effectively ending it for MH, until Frankie Stein gets another one of her crazy ideas: let ghouls play.  But this so goes against tradition that the remaining healthy male members quit the team in protest.  Now it is ALL up to our heroines to learn to play the game, to learn to WIN the game, to recruit the right ghouls, and to save their school (again, quite literally).  Gently Pushed Moral: Just because it's tradition doesn't mean it's good.

Note: The earliest Monster High DVD was the 1st TV special ""New Ghoul at School"" but it was only made available in limited editions of the Dawn of the Dance series of dolls:

5402264,5,B00AA8Q0FQ,"We happened to rent a Monster High movies from a red box in the grocery store.  My 5-year old made the choice, not me.  We had never rented or watched anything Monster High in the past.  Within the 24 hours we were allowed to view the movie, we had to watch it about 6 times.  Then the next day (and the next day....and the next day...you get the drift) she kep asking for Monster High.  I opted to go see what Amazon had and found this double feature for $7.99 and bought it.

Since we've received it we've watched it countless times.  I believe it has even pushed Frozen out of the ""My Favorite"" movie category in my daughter's list of all-time favorites.  Now that is major!  (She still loves the soundtrack to Frozen and HAS to listen to it in our van anywhere we go!)

I give this double duo two big thumbs up!",1404000000,,815,4.2

Friday Night Frights moral: girls can do things just like boys can do, and they can put their own spin on it.  Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love? moral: Follow your heart, appearances can be deceiving, and there is no easy in or out of love so using cupid's arrow is NOT a good idea!

Turns out, they have some pretty good messages in the movies such as, kindness to others, friendship loyalty, believing in yourself, trying your best....that sort of thing.

5402283,1,B00AA8Q0FQ,"These were the first Monster High shows I ever watched.  I'm not basing this on the DVD release, but on the ""movies"" themselves.  Pretty much, the entire time, the girls in this movie are so extremely worried about their popularity, that it seldom moves beyond that point.  They're all worried about having the latest trends and all that BS.  It was so blatant, and in your face, it was difficult to find any more meaning to these movies than that.

So, if you want your daughter(s) to grow up to be superficial, gold-diggers, these are the movies for you.  However, if you want your daughters to be productive members of society, with self-worth, look elsewhere.",1393632000,,663,4.721739130434782

I thought it was a good value and was part of the prime shipping. Shortly after her birthday, I got a call from their mother thanking me for the ""quiet time"".  She said that she pops this baby in and the girls are transfixed for the duration of the movie. As she put it - just enough time for her to regain her sanity.

5402286,5,B00AA8Q0FQ,She is really into the monster high/everafter high thing. I watched it with her. The story has a bit more of the teen angle but it was fun to watch. I really do not understand why everyone one has to wear high heel shoes.. That kind of drives me crazy..... I really do not like that. It sends the wrong message... I like the girls can do anything attitude... but I feel like when barbie is doing a better job at girls can do anything then someone needs to step up there game. With that in mind I will purchase this story for her again because I found it fun and entertaining. She loves it,1393286400,,588,4.121739130434783

I never paid much attention to them at the store until she came home saying every little girl at school had them. I started to look into them, and was really surprised how unspooky they were! I got the movie and watched it before I let her, and I didn't see anything I disagree with. they dress more appropriate than most the new dolls out there, and the stories were really cute! looking forward to purchasing the other movies to come as well!",1387929600,,531,4.32

5402321,5,B00AA8Q0FQ,"Like I think most parents, I was hesitant to buy my daughter the Monster High line of movies. Mattel's Barbie movies are awful and sickeningly shallow, if you ask me. I couldn't expect much different from Mattel being behind Monster High.
I was wrong. We actually can sit and watch the Monster High movies with my daughter without wanting to scream. She loves the storyline and I really love the Monster High message of ""Be You, be unique, be a monster"" I love what the dolls and the line stand for and the movie follows suit.
One of the movies in this one is a school sports competition, Skulltimate Roller Maze. The girls work together and it teaches teamwork while still having fun.
The other one was one I was a little nervous about-Ghouls Falling in Love? Don't get me wrong, ghouls deserve love too, but I was leery that it was going to be one of those 'girls need a man to live' movies. It isn't. It's a message of friendship and love.",1382572800,3,942,4.419540229885057
