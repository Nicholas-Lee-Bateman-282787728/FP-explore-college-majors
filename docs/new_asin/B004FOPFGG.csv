8428129,5,B004FOPFGG,"I am really not a fan of ""true story"" TV movies, but ""Bringing Ashley Home"" was something else altogether.  Nothing was glossed over, shied away from or sugar-coated in this story of one sister searching for another in the dark and dangerous world of mental illness, drug abuse, and the adult homeless.  I felt I was taken into this world and it was not a pleasant place -- but it was rivetting, dramatic, and harrowing.  It felt authentic from beginning to end.

Libba Phillips is an amazing woman and out of all this darkness came something positive, ""Outpost for Hope,"" a national organizatioon dedicated to helping families find missing adults.

Jennifer Morrison and AJ Cook give outstanding performances.  The dialogue was crisp and so well crafted; the whole movie was exceptionally well written. Never felt forced and fake -- even when Libba weas dealing with the dissolution of her marriage, the scenes were wonderfully sparse and powerful.  Sometimes a few carefully chosen words have much more impact that the long speeches we see too often in TV  movies.

All in all, I consider this a must see for anyone interested in these issues, or simply how powerful love can be.",1308700800,2,1181,4.865
