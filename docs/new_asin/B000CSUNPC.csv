a bit or tivia for you, mary left the series early on and didn't even complete the first season. honestly, i don't remember. i do recall that she was paid a mere pitence for the show.",1150329600,11,491,4.336956521739131
8101987,1,B000CSUNPC,"I loved the Richard Diamond series with David Janssen and this is the first one, I'm told. But it really is terrible. And it didn't even show Mary Tyler Moore's legs (she played his secretary later in the series). Bummer... Best to try something from the second year.",1437696000,2,267,4.583333333333333
8101988,5,B000CSUNPC,"DAVID JANSSEN did not set out to be an actor.  It was the furthest thing from his mind. A high school pole vaulting accident seriously injured his left knee, and his dreams of being a Pro Athlete ended.  His mother Berneice PUSHED him into the glamorous profession that is Tinsel town.  He decided to give it a try.  He was not an ""overnight star"".  He struggled and he worked hard.  His career was put on hold when the U. S. Army came calling. He served his country and then returned to Hollywood.  Actor/Director/Producer DICK POWELL was impressed with his voice, his good looks and his machinations.  POWELL ""hand-picked"" DAVID JANSSEN to take POWELL's Radio role, ""RICHARD DIAMOND-PRIVATE DETECTIVE"" to the emerging medium called Television.  DAVID JANSSEN became a STAR of the small screen.  With solid scripts, excellent directors and talented actors, ""RICHARD DIAMOND-PRIVATE DETECTIVE"" propelled DAVID JANSSEN to Stardom.  Although he strived to achieve a solid place in the more respectable (at the time) ""Big Screen"", his Star on the ""Small Screen"" again caught the eye of Producer QUINN MARTIN, who agreed to produce ""THE FUGITIVE"" (created by ROY HUGGINS) for the fledgling ABC Television Network.  MARTIN agreed to produce ""THE FUGITIVE"" ONLY IF DAVID JANSSEN would take on the role of ""Dr, Richard Kimble"".  ""THE FUGITIVE"" brought DAVID JANSSEN international fame and fortune.
I am very happy and proud that Passport Entertainment LLC and AMAZON has made the ""Picture of Fear"" and ""The Chess Player"" episodes available on DVD for the old fans and the millions of NEW fans of a very talented DAVID JANSSEN. They sure don't make television series anymore with the quality of ""RICHARD DIAMOND-PRIVATE DETECTIVE"".",1366502400,8,1723,5.110714285714286

8101990,5,B000CSUNPC,"Service, shipping, product, description were excellent. The only problem I had was I wanted more than the one CD. It was that good! Many thanks for your excellent service!",1359676800,3,171,4.931034482758621
8101991,5,B000CSUNPC,"I would highly recommend to buy this DVD.
It shows the real talent of the unforgettable actor David Janssen (incl. a little bio also).
Remember: The Fugitive, the Original, this actor is outstanding.

Transaction was great! Thank you!",1357344000,3,234,5.157894736842105
8101992,4,B000CSUNPC,Nice films but wish there was more... Just started to get into the series but it was only two episodes...,1286409600,5,105,4.3
8101993,1,B000CSUNPC,"It's interesting in the age of HD and the amazing technology available, that shows like this are still unavailable to the public. Surely all of the CBS/NBC episodes are somewhere. I had a C-Band satellite (the big 6 foot dishes) back in the early 1990's and there was a station that showed this series everyday and that's how I discovered it. I loved the series and have always tried to find it on DVD or even VHS to no avail. We should somehow find out who owns the show and write to see if it will ever be released.",1228780800,23,517,4.232323232323233
8101994,3,B000CSUNPC,"As a big David Janssen fan I was looking forward to seeing something new and fresh even before The Fugitive came out.
The quality of this DVD is very poor and makes it hard to watch.

Someone should take this entire series and digitally remaster it!",1202601600,31,249,4.413043478260869
8101995,5,B000CSUNPC,"The DVD transfer is awful.  Stay away from this DVD it shouldnt even be available, even the maxwell house coffee ads are still intertwined....",1196208000,14,142,4.916666666666667
8101996,5,B000CSUNPC,"My only complaint about this dvd is that there are only 2 episodes from the series on it. Both episodes excellent. Good story-lines. David Janssen in top form. An extra perk was the amusing Maxwell House presents intros. I had flashes of Jack Lemmon sitting in front of TV in The Apartment trying to find something to watch & only be able to find all the promo stuff :)
BTW on this DVD is HOLLYWOOD REMEMBERS DAVID JANSSEN which is a great, all be it concise, profile of David Janssen, which I personally thoroughly enjoyed.",1192233600,21,524,4.526315789473684
