8333732,5,B001PM3H1G,"I loved the 4 MGM shorts here in this DVD. Yes, a genuine DVD not a DVD-R. Put out by Warner Brothers, this showcases 4 shorts with Alfalfa as the main character. Quality of picture and sound are exceptional. However, no menu on the DVD, and selection of shorts. Starts pretty much after initial DVD logos and plays one right after another. You can always use chapter search to go through episodes. I got my edition years ago for only 1 penny! Yes, at a Suncoast Movie Company store closeout.
The episodes are as follows ~
ALFALFA'S AUNT (Aunt Penelope comes to visit her sister's family while writing a murder mystery using the Switzer's name with hilarious results.)
ALFALFA'S DOUBLE (A rich kid across the tracks comes to town, meets up with Alfalfa, they trade places for a bit, with consequences.)
COUSIN WILBUR (Scotty Beckett plays the character with completely different outfit and talk)
AUTO ANTICS (A car race is put on with hilarious results, but the ""gang"" needs the 5 dollar prize money to get their ""dog"" out of the pound.)",1424995200,,1037,4.7032967032967035
