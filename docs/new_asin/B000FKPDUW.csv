8124273,1,B000FKPDUW,"Gordon Liu plays a small part in this film as the master that dies.  We see one fight with him in the beginning, but it's riddle with wire-fu and ridiculous and over the top moves.  None of it is believable.  From the beginning the story is rushed and mimicks all films based on this story.  It comes off as a cheap knock-off of the real deal, which would be the original Bruce Lee movie (Fist of Fury) and the Jet Li remake (Fist of Legend).  If you love the story watch either of those movies and skip this one.  The choreography is weak and the actors are obviously not martial artists at all, or very poor at it.  The fight sequences are copies of the ones in both movies, but they don't come anywhere near pulling it off.  I rented this movie because Gordon Liu put his name on it.  I expected real martial arts action but what I got was the worst martial arts movie I've ever seen, bar none.  Even the most cheesiest 70's martial arts flicks have more entertainment value than this movie.  Ugh, it makes me cringe thinking about it.  If you want some good Gordon Liu action you should check out his films from the 70's which are true classics and action-packed.  Skip this one altogether.",1172880000,,1194,4.34841628959276
8124274,1,B000FKPDUW,"This is one of the worst martial arts movie I have ever seen. Chinese Connection (Fist of Fury) was classic. Jet Li's remake in Fist of Legend did the classic justice. Sadly, Billy Chow, who was in Fist of Legend, made himself the bad guy here again and was just horrible...probably the worst film for him because he is typically very good. Choreography is something you would see in a home made film of a bunch of wannabes trying to fight...it is THAT bad. I've watched and reviewed several martial art flicks (just check my reviews) and this movie is a joke in comparison...I literally found myself laughing and shaking my head in disgust. The producer and choreographer tried so hard to duplicate the awesome moves found in Fist of Legend, but utterly fails. The main actor playing Chen Jen is just too amateurish of a fighter and is a laughable Bruce Lee imitator. Sammo Hung did a better imitation of him in his overlooked, but excellent Enter the Fat Dragon flick. Glad I only rented the movie. If you want a good laugh or see a horrible Chinese Connection/Fist of Legend remake, then this is for you!!! Otherwise, look elsewhere.",1157414400,,1136,4.656716417910448
8124275,3,B000FKPDUW,"I first heard about this particular Fist of Fury remake at a Bruce Lee clone website, on which it was blasted as being a 21st Bruce Lee clone, chop socky flick in which Dragon Shek joined the long line of 80's and 90's Bruce Lee imitators. However, having purchased the dvd and watched it for the first time, I considered it unique, not only a remake of Chinese Connection(bka Fist of Fury) but a reinterpretation and reinvention of the Bruce Lee classic. The action is there, the choreography is there, the story is unique in that this time around, Chen is married, the Ching Wu school is wiped out in the Japanese retaliation, it turns out that Chen's wife poisoned his Sifu, and the ending is quite alternate. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the fact that Dragon Shek seemed to have been wearing a Bruce Lee wig...as many Bruce Lee clones did in attempted 1970's Bruce Lee biopics, and while he did a few Bruce Lee yells throughout the pic, he doesn't really attempt to mimick Bruce Lee's fighting style...this film reminds me alot of Jet Li's portrayal in Fist of Legend. Not the best, but a keeper for those like myself who enjoy a good,new spin on the Chinese Connection legacy. Bruce Lee,RIP.",1157328000,,1209,4.5504587155963305
