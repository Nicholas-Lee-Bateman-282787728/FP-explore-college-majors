MIRACLE's Liz Taylor double feature is practically three movies, not two!

DIVORCE HIS / DIVORCE HERS (USA/UK-1973)
Originally a two-night broadcast. The story of the crumbling of a long-time a marriage is told from both points of views. While some scenes appear in both halves, there's others that show what the man or woman does or says when not with their spouse. After a two-year separation. Lz and Dick meet by chance in Rome and go through their union's death throes. An innovative idea (twin stories) that ultimately garners only 'OK' results.

THE DRIVER'S SEAT (Italy-1974)
Highly neurotic Liz arrives in Rome on a mandatory vacation and seeks out in the city's seamier districts a mate willing to love her and leave her... DEAD. Liz desires to be ceremoniously bound and then murdered with a knife. Macabre atmosphere captured through skilled cinematography, sets and lighting amply give a sense of the insanity that haunt's this character's conscience. An obvious semi-deranged self-absorption is wonderfully conveyed by Miss Taylor in one of her least remembered yet most-difficult roles.",1268870400,,1281,5.20873786407767
