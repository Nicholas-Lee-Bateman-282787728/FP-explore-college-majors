1452409,5,B00005JLFV,"This collector's set is one of the best things to come out on DVD. It would be a great gift to a friend or loved one, or even to yourself. Any fan of Law+Order should love this set (if they are a true fan, of course). I have been watching the show for about eight years, and I still look forward to every Wednesday night at 10PM EST.

 Why watch the commercial-ridden reruns on TNT or A+E when you can watch the best show on television commercial-free and digitally remastered?

 Get this set and catch up on those episodes that you haven't seen or would love to see again. Or buy the set for a friend who loves the show or you are trying to get into watching the show. My wife hated the show eight years ago, but now looks forward to every episode (new or old) just as much as I do. The shows is addicting, and I love it.

 NOTE: If you love this show, you should also check out the Law+Order video game.",1036627200,,905,4.084745762711864
1452410,5,B00005JLFV,I have been a fan of Law and Order for a couple of years now and I was so excited to see that they were releasing the first season on DVD.  Every episode is terrific and keeps you guessing until the end.  This set should be a must buy for every fan of the show.  I sincerely hope that they release the second season as well.  I will be the first in line to buy it.,1036540800,,364,3.75
1452411,5,B00005JLFV,"I don't watch much TV at all anymore, but I'm a bit of a sucker for this show. I'd sacrifice nearly anything to see the new episodes as they air. I remember the holiday marathons A&E would run of syndicated Law & Order episodes and watching eight shows straight. Even after seeing most episodes multiple times, I tuned into the reruns whenever possible (which were once shown daily on A&E).
So, I'm obviously ecstatic that Law & Order has finally begun to make its move to DVD. While the first few episodes can be a bit dry and the production values are low, it remains praiseworthy for its realism, unique storytelling, amazing writing, intense performance, and fair exploration of moral conflicts. The stories are typically influenced by real-life headlines, and maybe you'll recognize some. Contrary to the typical drama, the personal lives of the characters are peripheral rather than primary. The personal side of the characters does manifest, of course, but the scripts do not directly pursue this. They appear adjunctively to the stories, and once one grows to understand the dynamic personalities, the show attains deeper impact. It's also a bit weird to watch these episodes with all the changes in the series (now in season 13, no one remains from the original cast).
The show accomplishes much with its formula. To quote the voice intro for every episode: ""In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the police who investigate crime, and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories."" That's exactly what it is. The first half of the show sets the exposition of the crime and follows Sgt. Greevey and Detective Logan (George Dzundza and Chris Noth, respectively) and as they hunt down the criminal with the guidance of Captain Cragen (Dann Florek).
Once the suspect is apprehended, the show follows the prosecution of the alleged criminal at the hands of ADAs Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty) and Paul Robinette (Richard Brooks). The pragmatic and politically minded DA Adam Schiff (Steven Hill) offers dry wit and candid advice. Personally, I'm a little more drawn to the prosecution side of things because it tends to be the most climactic. Here, the ADAs must administer plea bargains, prepare their cases, and of course face-off with the defendants at trial.
Cases are rarely straightforward - suspicions switch around, new evidence appears, and so on. The show also evenhandedly looks at different moral and social issues, but perhaps more so in later seasons. Some issues dealt with in the first season are abortion, assisted suicide for the terminally ill, racial equality, and others. Later seasons would explore technicalities of the New York legal system in greater detail, and diversify the legal matters explored.
Here are some cheap, quick episode descriptions - spoiler free and superficially uninteresting:
""Prescription for Death"" - A young girl dies during a chaotic night in a hospital, despite the lack of a serious ailment.
""Subterranean Homeboy Blues"" - The shooting of two black teenagers in a subway car leads to serious racial tensions.
""The Reaper's Helper"" - It would appear that a serial killer is targeting gay men, but...
""Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die"" - A young woman is found badly beaten in her bed. The prosecutors may need questionable tactics to convict their man.
""Happily Ever After"" - A wealthy couple is shot in their parking garage.
""Everybody's Favorite Bagman"" - A councilman is mugged, a simple crime which leads the district attorney's office to something big.
""By Hooker, By Crook"" - A wealthy man is found unconscious in a park after a night with a prostitute.
""Poison Ivy"" - Greevey and Logan investigate the shooting of an apparent drug dealer by a fellow police officer.
""Indifference"" - A very disturbing episode where detectives look for the culprit responsible for bludgeoning an abused little girl on the skull.
""Prisoner of Love"" - A sadomasochist is found murdered, and his killers are discovered to have a peculiar relationship.
""Out of the Half-Light"" - A black congressman uses the alleged rape of a young girl to further his political career.
""Life Choice"" - The police investigate the bombing of an abortion clinic.
""A Death in the Family"" - The detectives aggressively hunt the man suspected of killing a cop.
""The Violence of Summer"" - A backward episode that puts the legal stuff first and the cop stuff second. Stone and Robinette struggle to rebuild a fractured case against three boys accused of raping a reporter.
""The Torrents of Greed"" - This is a two-parter, and it follows ADA Stone's obsessive drive to nail a mob boss.
""Mushrooms"" - Two children are shot in their own home, and the killer is not what anyone expects.
""The Secret Sharers"" - The murder of a drug dealer winds up pitting Stone against a hotshot Texas lawyer who defends the suspect pro bono.
""The Serpent's Tooth"" - This one has echoes of the Menendez brothers as two boys are suspected of killing their parents.
""The Troubles"" - Who killed the Lebanese weapon smuggler - a Cuban drug dealer or an accused Irish terrorist?
""Sonata for a Solo Organ"" - A man is found in Central Park missing one of his kidneys.
""The Blue Wall"" - Captain Cragen is under suspicion for tampering with evidence.
Anyway...assuming you're still reading along this far, now is a good time to jump into the series. Law & Order is an epochal television series that deserves all its acclaim.",1035590400,13,5505,4.952432432432432
1452412,5,B00005JLFV,"I am an avid Law and Order Fan, and just like the British Empire of Ole, the networks have been kind enough to make sure that the sun never sets on Law and Order.  You can catch an episode at almost any hour of the day on some network, and I usually do.  Anyhow, Being this much of a fan, I jumped at the oppurtunity to own this set and I am Very Happy I did!
I wasn't sure what to expect since the original production dates for the first season go back to 1988, long before any standard digital format, but when I watched my first episode from the collection, I was happy... nah, shocked at how good the audio/video quality really was.  In addition, the casing was beautifully done, and the liner notes contain pictures from each episode, along w/ descriptions, and other pertinate information.
All in all I was VERY satisfied with this collection, and since the series will be running to at least its 15th season, I look forward to owning the entire collection!",1035244800,3,963,4.398876404494382
1452413,4,B00005JLFV,"Law & Order was once a remarkable television series, and this, a collection of its first series immortalizes that fact.  It's too bad the series is in such a downfall to a disappointing show aiming for shock value, meanwhile compromising above all intriguing writing.  And the mass of Law & Order ""sister"" shows (SVU, etc) doesn't help the integrity of this once prominant show.  The first couple of seasons (including this one) were really outstanding though.  Above all the cast in the older Law & Orders were really capturing.  Most notably Michael Moriarty as Executive A.D.A. Ben Stone and Steven Hill as D.A. Adam Schiff.  So scrap the bad recordings to VHS or catching reruns at unusual hours, grab a copy of this once great series and remember what good television used to be like.",1035158400,4,789,4.807407407407408
1452414,5,B00005JLFV,"One of tv's longest running and more critically acclaimed series is now available on DVD. ""Law and Order: The First Year"" collects the entire first season of this quality show. Featuring the show's original cast of characters (ADAs Ben Stone and Paul Robinette and Detectives Mike Logan and Max Greevey), the First Season contains classic ""Ripped From the Headlines"" styled episodes including ""Subterranean Homeboy Blues"" (about a woman who may or may not have shot a trio of black teenagers in self-defense), ""By Hooker, By Crook"" (which has Stone prosecuting a socialite/madam who is based upon the ""Mayflower Madam"" Sydney Barrows), and ""Out of the Half-Light"" (where the cops try to debunk a black teen's false accusations of rape at the hands of white police officers and prevent an Al Sharpton-inspired character from using the girl to advance his political adgenda).
Other original story episodes includes ""Poison Ivy"" (where Logan and Greevey investigate the death of an Ivy League college student who was a drug dealer and who may have had a gun planted on his dead body by the police officer who shot him), ""Indifference"" (Logan and Greevey investigate the death of a upper class child and discovers that the child was regularly raped by her father and beaten by her drug using mother), ""Prisoner of Love"" (which has Stone prosecuting a city commissioner and a weathly socialite/part-time dominatrix over the death of the commissioner's gay lover, who died during kinky sex), "" The Torrents of Greed Parts 1 and 2"" (which has ADA Stone obsessively attempting to bring down a mob boss after the mob boss is aquitted of murder), ""Mushrooms"" (Stone must decide whether or not to take a plea bargin from a teenager who killed a baby and paralyzed another teen when the shooter offers to testify that a powerfull mob boss ordered the killing), ""The Secret Sharers"" (Stone faces a hot shot Texas attorney who's client murdered a drug dealer who raped his fiance), ""The Serpent's Tooth"" (in which two innocent brothers are wrongfully accused and arrested for the Menendez Brothers-esque murder of their parents while Stone believes that the ultra-violent Russian Mob may be the real culprits), ""Troubles"" (which has Stone going after a famous Irish terrorist who arranges for the principal witnesses against him murdered before they can implicate him in court), and ""The Blue Wall"" (the season finale, which has Logan and Greevey investigating a conspiracy inside the police department that resulted in evidence against corporate executives on trial disappearing and discovering that a friend of theirs, Captain Donald Cragen may have been involved in the conspiracy).",1030752000,41,2671,5.142528735632184
1452415,5,B00005JLFV,"Season 1 may have had somewhat weak production values but the rapid-fire policework and no-nonsense story-telling which has become the series' hallmark was already there.
Michael Moriarty, as ADA Stone, may have been the best character that season; none of the series regulars from that season are still on the show, though Dann Florek (Capt. Cragen) is now a regular on SVU.
The plots of the first season, as in later seasons, emphasized difficult decisions; the doctor whose alcoholism may or may not have contributed to a patient's death (Prescription for Death) or the AIDS patients who had their ""suicides"" assisted by a gay man (The Reaper's Helper).
The series pilot (filmed in 1988) was shown as the sixth episode in the first season (1990). In all there were 22 episodes shown in that first season.
I don't expect much in the way of picture/sound quality in this DVD release given the years in which these were filmed.",1028419200,13,927,4.8734177215189876

Even the early seasons from the 1980s and 1990s (Big hair, bright colors, power suits, shoulder pads...etc.---and all) are as interesting, suspenseful and thought provoking as the later episodes.  Speaking of which; when is Amazon going to make all the episodes between seasons 2 and 16---a significant gap!--available for streaming? particularly the episodes in which actors  Jerry Ohrbach and Benjamin Bratt are partnered up???

1453833,5,B00005JLFV,"After Law & Order was pulled from NBC, I found it necessary to pursue purchasing the seasons on DVD.  This was one of my favorite shows for awhile because the concept of displaying all the legal angles from following the clues to the eventual prosecution was never previously utilized on TV.  It gave the audience a greater understanding of how the legal system works, albeit in a fictional setting.  Season One was great for many reasons as it was as limited in other regards.  The writers were beginning to develop their understanding of NYC, yet sometimes mentioned criminals like they were bigger than they were.  NYC is too huge to feature bad guys like ""Mosquito"" and others when there are so many other crimes being perpetrated on a daily basis.  However, the writers moved from this localization of the ""Big Apple"" and focused on the cops and DAs and how they went about solving crime.  Originally, the episodes had poor lighting with only a few indoor sets.  I do love the characters and how they reconciled their Roman Catholic beliefs along with their secular work as law enforcement agents.  There was a lot of dialogue which helped us to better understand them as they revealed how their upbringing affected how they acted as adults and as cops or lawyers.  DA Ben Stone was one of my favorite cast members because he pursued righteousness while sometimes recognizing his own human frailty.  I also enjoyed Lt. Cragen and Detective Logan because their beliefs were on the surface and could be seen without them being portrayed as self-righteous.  I prefer the earlier seasons because these characters had unresolved issues with their faith yet still found the peace of mind to pursue truth and justice.  I appreciate seeing the dichotomy of humanity in shows like this, in this format because it demonstrates how high we can soar and how low we can fall as humans.  This show represented the essence of humanity.  Whether you are Christian or not, this series is worth a viewing as you watch the characters develop, through their strengths and weaknesses.",1416096000,10,2068,4.851851851851852
1453834,5,B00005JLFV,"Excellent!! I was a late bloomer to law and order and 20 years later no show comes close. Plots, acting, special guests before they were well known, and realistic atmosphere.

1454201,5,B00005JLFV,"No; I'm not getting political; instead; I'm indirectly quoting Dick Wolf! In his featurette for the first season of Law & Order; Wolf talks about his inspiration to create L&O and how, at the time (1988), the show's title was becoming more commonly known as a result of the Reagan administration. As Wolf also adds, Law & Order is the very first cop show to observe both cops ***and*** lawyers prosecuting; rather than just cops! Two years before creating Law & Order, Dick Wolf had become a frequent screenwriter for Miami Vice, and the same grittiness he gave Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, he gave original L&O stars George Dzundza (written out after the first season due to having to share the star title with his cast mates and being frustrated with having to commute from Los Angeles to New York constantly) and Chris Noth.

Dzundza and Noth were not introduced without style, either. They tell jokes and, at the same time, they manage to put the fear of God into criminals, the very men and women who threaten the street of New York City and abroad. Their backgrounds are quite unique: while both men are Catholic, Dzundza's Detective Sergeant Max Greevey happens to be a very devout Catholic. As we learn from the episode Life Choice, Sergeant Greevey is pro-life and cares deeply about the lives of innocent, unborn babies. Detective Logan, meanwhile, is cynical of his Catholic ""faith"" (quotation marks not on behalf of the faith itself but of Detective Logan's cynical faith--which isn't really faith, as you learn from getting to know Logan better) and is pro-choice entirely. Detective Logan hurts for the women who lost their clinic (to a bombing) and Sergeant Greevey struggles to not empathize with those guilty for the bombing.

Ah, yes: the episodes of Law & Order are, as it has been commonly said, ""ripped straight from the headlines."" They can be very disturbing at times--sometimes too disturbing. But, as we all know, a show has to be honest in order to be real.

With the character progression, action, suspense, drama, and sometimes humor, plus bonus features (a preview for the Law & Order computer game and interviews with Dick Wolf and fellow L&O crew members about the creation of the show and its background), the first season DVD for Law & Order is, hands down, a winner.

Highly recommended.

Features Dann Florek in his current SVU role as Captain Donald ""Don"" Cragen, along with (for one episode each, separately of each other) S. Epatha Merkerson and Courtney B. Vance, three years before Merkerson joined the cast of L&O and eleven years before Vance joined in the cast of L&O: Criminal Intent (neither of them play their future, permanent characters).",1377993600,2,2696,4.864923747276689

1454208,4,B00005JLFV,"As much a product of it's time as Miami Vice, Law and Order Season 1 is a gritty look at New York at about the time New York was turning itself around.  This series has an odd, documentary style to it that is mesmerizing.  It's not shot like the Office or in the shaky cam style but the film stock used and the loosey goosey acting, directing and editing remind me of an old 70's film like Serpico.  The plots are a throw back to the politically incorrect 70's too.  I can't imagine a television show siding with the police against Reverend Al Sharpton like this one did in the fictionalized account of the Tawana Brawley case.  It's not just a matter of taking on Sharpton but giving an unbiased account of the facts.  In later seasons of this and Law and Order: SVU the ""ripped from the headlines"" tag meant the story was adjusted for a more liberal interpretation, kind of like Aaron Sorkin's Newsroom.

The stories here are much more believable than what came later.  Newer seasons of this show and (again) SVU became a self-parody with the ""Law & Order twist"" that was always advertised in the commercials.  This season made due with straight forward story-telling with the twists feeling more organic and less forced than the three or sometimes four different McGuffins, each more ridiculous than the last in later episodes.  There were several more good seasons but none better than the first of Law and Order.",1374883200,2,1417,4.609561752988048

1454292,5,B00005JLFV,"Surely everyone has watched at least one episode of this ubiquitous program by now. From 1990 to 2010, it was a must-see on tv, and has since achieved immortality through reruns on multiple channels. Apparently that wasn't good enough for me, as I just bought the entire first season and watched all 22 episodes in order. Ahhh! First, the price can't be beat - 22 beautifully acted shows for a mere $14.99. Second, that terrific acting was performed by both seasoned and novice people whose careers have often blossomed in the years since then. In one, I was delighted to see a young Ice-T doing a very neat break-dance. Third, the writing is great. A lot of the episodes are ""ripped from the headlines"" with interesting spins. The photography is rather grainy. I believe this was done deliberately to emphasize the gritty nature of police work. The precinct is as shabby as any stereotyped cop shop. There are almost no special effects; the storyline and acting carry each show without any need for flash and dazzle. I think a really good reason to watch this is to see the beginning of the iconic series. People who were more accustomed to recent incarnations of it, such as S. Epatha Merkerson as the Captain, would be surprised to see her first appearance in Season 1 as a widowed mother whose baby was killed. Viewers of Law & Order: SVU who know Dann Florek as Don Cragen can see his early career as Captain in the parent series. Chris Noth, who later wound up in Law & Order: Criminal Intent, is a hot-headed (and very handsome) detective here. There were no bad episodes. No mediocre episodes. Each and every program is wonderful, and a few are true stand-outs. I highly recommend this. Consider: I've been watching Law & Order for 23 years, and I've never become tired of it. I've seen these episodes numerous times, and enjoyed them just as much now that I bought the whole first season. I can hardly wait to view Season 2!",1366329600,7,1933,4.622093023255814

Law & Order used our building for a number of episodes in the early seasons. 1B was very popular, and our unit 1C was across the courtyard from it. That made it very convenient for use as the apartment of a neighbor who was witnessing things his neighbors would have rather he had not known. They rented our home, the pets stayed at my job for 2 days (Bergh Memorial Hospital of the A.S.P.C.A.) (I'm a Vet Tech) , & I got a $250. donation for the ASPCA to boot.

1454392,5,B00005JLFV,"This is one of the greatest shows to run on television and my favorite. It is a shame that now the whole series of Law & Order is on DVD when I have already started started my collection. I didn't buy it from Amazon, I bought it from a store out of sheer luck. Anyways, If you are a fan of Law & Order or even just SVU, buy this season. Every episode is gritty and groundbreaking and it's amazing to know of the cases they are based on. Here we have Sgt. Max Greevey, the family man whose skeptical of Doctors and is pro-life. He is also a very driven detective who gets emotional from the cases sometimes. His partner Det. Mike Logan, a chauvinistic ladies' man and more liberal than his partner. Had an abusive mother growing up and tends to disagree with his partner often, a great example was the episode ""Life Choice,"" where detectives investigate the bombing of an abortion clinic. Their boss, Capt. Don Cragen. Also married, a recovering alcoholic and Sgt. Greevey's former partner who supervises the detectives and their cases. EADA Ben Stone, a conservative family man who strongly believes in what he's fighting for. One of my favorite Robinette episodes is Indifference, about child abuse (which is later revisited in season 15's Fixed) ADA Paul Robinette a young African-American prosecutor and assistant to Stone who decides whether or not the police have sufficient evidence for warrants, appears at bail hearings and along with Stone talks to victims and witnesses. When race is a topic in an episode, Robinette usually plays an important part. DA Adam Schiff, a long serving DA, the liberal opposite to conflict with Stone at times. The episodes are some of the finest. The Pilot (Everbody's Favorite Bagman), Indifference, Out of The Half-Light, Life Choice, Torrents of Greed parts 1 & 2, Mushrooms and Kiss The Girls And Make Them Die.

For fans of SVU, the episode ""Kiss The Girls And Make Them Die"" was the earliest inspiration for SVU. Plus, this was Dann Florek's very early appearance as Captain Cragen, a character he would eventually carry out into SVU.

If you like the original series or SVU, then you will enjoy watching the first year of Law & Order. The controversial show that almost didn't happen.",1335312000,,2230,4.744845360824742

It is also not the New York you know--if you are younger. 1990: a World Trade Center, a crack epidemic, a spray painted subway jungle, a yearly murder rate in the 100s, no cell phones, no internet. The bodega, not the Starbucks.

This is the sometimes dark and violent city I lived in in 1990, and the one Detectives Mike Logan (Chris Noth) and Max Greevy (George Dzundna) patrol. The two old school cops scan this high crime city, working through each crime like casualties in an emergency room. Robert Chambers, Joel Steinberg, drive by shootings. These cops navigate through footwork and payphones.

If you are older like me, you'll watch, still surprised at the slowness of communication, the use of paper files, all being local. How different 1990 was.

Jack McCoy did not prosecute the crimes. He did not exist until 1994. His job was Ben Stone's, played by Michael Moriarty. Where McCoy may be zellous, Stone was earnest. He cared more about points of law, a thinker without McCoys killer ambition to win. McCoy could be your drinking partner. Stone was your professor.

You may also get the feeling issues and legal points here are being over-explained. This is true by 2010 standards: but keep in mind, we are so much more sophisticated about law now no small part due to Law and Order. If you didn't understand a point, you could not just Google it. So the writing here is for a 1990 world

This is a good show in and of itself, but it is a bit jarring when you hear no Lennie wisecrack, don't see Jack's next saber tooth attack. If you want to start with what I call Law and Order Proper, start with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Fifth-Year-1994-1995-Season/dp/B000MCH5AO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order - The Fifth Year (1994-1995 Season)</a>.

1454485,4,B00005JLFV,"Law and Order is an hour long drama that premiered on NBC. The show follows a simple but compelling formula. The first half of the show is about a police investigation into some crime. The second half of the show is the DA's office taking the case from the police.

The show has a good cast but due to the show's format, there is little character development. Thus, the show is accessible to anyone regardless of season. You needn't watch the show in episode order. This is both a benefit and detriment. The lack of character development allows the writers to explore the story more fully but lacks the substance of other police dramas such as The Shield (a show with both profound story and character development).

The cast of the first season includes George Dzundza as Detective Max Greevey. His partner is Chris Noth's Detective Mike Logan. Logan is the younger, smart aleky cop to Greevey's older, street smart detective.

Their supervisor is Dann Florek's character Captain Donald Cragen. Cragen is the cliche police adminstrator who is forever worried about the politics of a given case.

The DA's office has Steven Hill playing DA Adam Schiff, Michael Moriarty as Ben Stone and Paul Robinette played by Richard Brooks. Schiff is another Cragen, forever worried about the effects a case will have on his DA's office. Moriarty is the tough, no-nosense senior DA who takes Paul Robinette under his wing.

The first season of Law and Order is a good 1st season. Like most shows, it improves with time. The better casts will make their way to the show in later seasons.

Here is a synopsis of the 22 episodes in the first season.

#1 Prescription for death
A young woman is admitted into the hospital for a sore throat. She ends up dying. The investigation leads Detectives Greevey and Logan to the head of the hospital Dr. Edward Auster. DA Ben Stone builds a case against Dr. Auster that his alcoholism made him criminally negligent for the death of Ms. Morton.

#2 Subterranean Homeboy Blues
A woman boards a subway. After sitting for a few minutes she opens fire on two young men. Detectives Greevey and Logan track down the woman from various witness descriptions. The woman, Laura Di Biasi, claims it was self defense. DA Ben Stone must weigh the woman's case for self preservation against rising vigilantism in the city along with racial tempers.

#3 The Reaper's Helper
A gay man is found shot to death in his apartment. Detective Greevey's superior police work in linking the killer to other crimes is revealed. DA Ben Stone is put between a rock and a hard place when trying a man who claims he is helping those with AIDS kill themselves.

#4 Kiss the Girls and make them die
A young woman is found sexually assaulted and badly beaten. Detectives Greevey and Logan turn over rocks looking for suspects. They set their sights on a wealthy, good looking guy who can have any woman he wants. DA Ben Stone tries to argue the merits of the case without letting the victim's lifestyle from being put on trial.

#5 Happily Ever After
A couple drives into a parking garage. As the garage door opens, a street thug enters surreptitiously. The couple no sooner parks the car when shots ring out, leaving the man dead and his wife wounded. Greevey and Logan struggle with uncooperative witnesses who ""saw nothing"" and little physical evidence to point to a perpetrator.  DA Stone has his work cut out for him when he drags the wife into court for conspiracy to kill her husband.

#6 Everybody's favorite bagman
Greevey and Logan investigate what appears to be a mugging and assault. A couple of thugs are seen robbing the fallen body of a city councilman. But the investigation will lead DA Stone into a conspiracy charge that involves the city's highest officials.

#7 By Hooker By Crook
A man's body is found in Central Park. Greevey and Logan turn over every rock in the city to learn the man was a john involved in a high priced prostitution service. The madam who ran this service hid behind her considerable wealth and her ubiquitous name to deflect the charges pressed against her.

#8 Poison Ivy
Internal Affairs confirms the shooting was clean. Then why does Detective Greevey believe otherwise? The young man who was shot was a hero to the community, a student at Princeton University. The community says he didn't even own a gun. DA Stone is caught between the politics of an enraged community and a blusterous police force.

#9 Indifference
Greevey and Logan are called to an elementary school to investigate the bruises on a child. The investigation leads them to the child's father who is a therapist and the girl's mother who is the abuser. DA Stone wants to make a case against the father for creating the situation in which his daughter would be abused.

An artist is dead in a twisted sex game. Greevey and Logan turn up rocks to reveal the culprits are powerful socialites. DA Stone puts the DA's office through the ringer when the socialites inflame the community.

#11 Out of the Half-Light
When a young black girl claims she was raped by white cops, the community becomes enflamed. Greevey and Logan run into a wall trying to investigate the crime when a congressman convinces the family not to cooperate.  The DA's office has to negotiate the desires of the community while seeking justice for the girl.

#12 Life Choice
Greevey and Logan respond to a bombing at an abortion clinic. They look into some of the more radical pro-life groups to uncover who was behind the bombing. DA Stone strives to put the mastermind behind bars not just a young woman who is ready to be martyred for her beliefs on abortion.

#13 A Death in the Family
A cop is shot to death. Clues from the investigation suggest the cop may have been dirty. However, Greevey and Logan get nothing but resistance from the dead cop's partner and coworkers. DA Stone has to dig deep to get to the truth behind the cop and his assailant.

#15 & #16 The Torrents of Greed Parts I &II
A candy store owner takes a licking from an anonymous thug. A neurotic homeless man is a witness. Greevey and Logan investigate and uncover a mob conspiracy.

#20 The Troubles
A prison van with three prisoners arrives to New York. The prisoners are part of various investigations. When the van arrives, one of the men is strangled. One of the prisoners is a Cuban with a history of strangulation but no motive. The other is an IRA terrorist. Upon investigation, Stone finds a link between the IRA terrorist and the victim.

#21 Sonata for a Solo Organ
A man is found bleeding and delirious in Central Park. He's rushed to the hospital. The diagnosis: his kidney was stolen. The kidney was transplanted into the daughter of one of New York's biggest philanthropists.

#22 The Blue Wall
All the evidence suggests Captain Cragen is guilty of tampering with evidence in a major white collar investigation. Logan and Greevey keep stepping on the toes of IAD when they try to help their besieged captain. The DA's office wants another crack at the perpetrators after an embarrassing defeat due to the evidence tampering.",1235952000,2,8320,4.660068259385666

1454551,5,B00005JLFV,"There had never been a series like this one. It's long lasting life gives a hint to that.
You are dealing with a TV drama that does not slip into a soap opera genre.  We know little of the private lives of the police officers or the court officers. But we do know just enough to make them real people.
The stories are based on the cases presented before them. The twists and turns of finding the truth and how difficult it really is.
The Law portion deals with the investigation, the trail of clues, or lack therof.  The relationship between partners.  And on that note, what other show has been able to deal with loss of characters, cast changes and such with such flawless ability.  No big explanations on why a member leaves and no big intoduction of the character that replaces him or her. This is sooo very refreshing!
The Order portion works in much the same way.  The investigation contiues and court prosecuters have to decide so many times how to deal with such a diverse set of criminals. Sometimes they even have deal with their own ethical threads.
Amazing TV. The episodes suck you in.  The cast, whichever season you watch, is above par.
Imagine, you see a case from start to finish in one hour. BAM!  Thats it.
And don't think the verdict is always ""Not Guilty"".  The juries are very human.

1454555,5,B00005JLFV,"Sometimes the first season of a show isn't as good as subsequent seasons.  Not in this case.  The first season of the critically acclaimed drama features great acting, great writing, and timely stories.  The show was not afraid to tackle sensitive topics like race relations, abortion, and AIDS.  In fact, the topic matter nearly got the show cancelled after the first season.  Sponsors were pulling out because of the subject matter.  According to [...] Wolf's interview for this DVD set, the only person at NBC who didn't want the show cancelled was then-president of the entertainment division, the late Brandon Tartikoff.  Good call, Brandon.

George Dzundza would quit the show after this season because he didn't want to move his family to New York.  Too bad, he and Chris Noth had excellent chemistry.  Michael Moriarty's performances can at times be overdramatic, but he did a good job as EADA Ben Stone.

The only drawback to this season is the sixth episode.  The show's pilot (filmed in 1988 for CBS and rejected, bet they wish they had that one back) airs as the sixth episode.  All of a sudden, Max Greevey is slimmer and has a affinity for cigars.  Also, there is a completely different DA.  In addition, some parts of the episode are clearly overdubbed.  It isn't enough to take away a star, but it is annoying.  Nevertheless, the first season of ""Law & Order"" is fantastic.  This DVD set is a highly recommended purchase.",1169424000,3,1437,4.795918367346939

One can not watch all of them there are too many, but this is one of the cutting edge programs with great camera work also.  Has the look and sound of classic New York police shows (gritty).  The camera is generally still and wide-angled unlike the more recent TV dramas with the ""in-your-face"" look and hand-held movement made popular by NYPD Blue.  The first season tackled social ills most programs didn't touch since Hawaii Five-O [desperately needed to be released to DVD by Paramount].  For one season, 22 episodes is impressive.  Now networks call 6-8 shows a ""season"".  True crime drama fans must have this.",1152316800,,778,4.594202898550725
1454558,5,B00005JLFV,"I'm new to the L&O DVD Collecting hobby.

""Law & Order: The First Year"" is a must-have for your TV DVD collection.  It includes people who would later appear in the incarnations of the L&O franchise:  Dann Florek (who would later be a part of L&O:SVU), and S. Epatha Merkerson (who would later join the cast of L&O in Season 4).

Overall, the episodes are great and I can't wait to purchase Season 2!",1143676800,,400,4.364864864864865
1454559,5,B00005JLFV,"Perhaps if Law & Order had only lasted one season, I wouldn't be giving it five stars. However, part of this season's appeal is seeing how the series has both changed and stayed the same over the last 16 years. The cast has changed several times over - in fact 22 people have played the six main roles in this show during its long run, with the last original cast member, Steven Hill as DA Adam Schiff, leaving in 2000. However, with each episode focusing on the crime at hand, and largely omitting any personal details about the main characters, all of these cast changes have done little to disrupt the show's energy over its very long run.
The series pilot, ""Everybody's Favorite Bagman"" was actually the sixth episode aired that year. If you wonder why it looks as though it was shot in a different decade - different film quality, George Dzundza (Max Greevey) has magically lost 20 pounds, and a completely different actor (Roy Thinnes) is playing a completely different DA (Alfred Wentworth)- it is because this episode was shot as a pilot for CBS in 1988, and rejected by that network. Thus when you hear comments made that seem to be introducing the characters after you have been watching them work together for six episodes, that is actually what is going on.
The ""ripped from the headlines"" episodes are present even in this first season - ""Kiss The Girls and Make Them Die""  and ""Indifference"", for example, are obvious clones of actual New York City homicides. However, there are also some cases that seem to be completely original such as ""Prisoner of Love"" in which Frances Conroy, the rather frumpy matron of the Fisher clan in the HBO series ""Six Feet Under"", plays a socialite dominatrix of all things! As far as interesting guest appearances go, you'll also notice that S. Epatha Merkerson, who plays Lieutenant Anita Van Buren from season four onward, is a mother whose children have been shot in their own home in ""Mushrooms"". This has been one thing Law & Order has done over the show's tenure that can be quite distracting to the regular viewer - bringing back the same actors and actresses to play different defendants, lawyers, and grieving family members in different episodes.
There is also a considerable bit of moralizing by the two detectives that you don't see in subsequent seasons, with Dzundza's Max Greevey taking the conservative Catholic view of matters and Noth's Mike Logan having a more liberal take on situations.
Finally, you'll notice how much times have changed since this series first aired. In ""The Reaper's Helper"", which aired in 1990, AIDS and HIV still mean a swift and grim death so that D.A. Ben Stone sabotages his own case when he learns that the mercy killing defendant has the disease himself. Today, advances in treatment and greatly expanded life expectancies of HIV patients make Stone's choice appear very odd. Also, you'll notice that the atmosphere of New York City is portrayed as loosely controlled chaos in which people are virtually sitting around waiting to get mugged versus the more orderly image that the city has today since crime dropped substantially during the 90's.
I really enjoyed this DVD set, especially since TNT now has the total rights to the repeats and usually never airs an episode made before 1998, at least not in the evenings. Thus this is really the only practical means of viewing the early days of Law and Order.",1142899200,11,3403,4.797274275979557
1454560,5,B00005JLFV,"They messed up a little in the info about the cast of characters in the 1st season.

Also, there are names as keywords for searching a little ways down, and those are all from later seasons (Jesse L Martin, S. Epathta Merkerson, Sam Waterston....NOT in 1st season). I believe the editorial review gets it right though...

Anyway, I am a HUGE fan of this series, have watched it since its inception, and I think it would appeal to just about anyone.

1454621,5,B00005JLFV,"Nominated for 52 Emmys since its 1990 premiere, including 11 for Outstanding Drama Series, Law & Order is one of the most popular television shows in modern day history. With an additional 4 Golden Globe nominations for Best TV Series (Drama), Law & Order is more than a TV show, it's a lucrative franchise for host network NBC, spawning popular spin-offs Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001), and (the now cancelled) Law & Order: Trial By Jury (2005). Filmed on location in New York City, the show is the brainchild of creator Dick Wolf, a longtime writer for successful TV series such as Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice. With sixteen successful seasons already on the books, and more on the way, Law & Order remains one of the best drama series available on any network...

Law & Order centers around the New York City criminal justice system, where ""the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups - the police who investigate crime, and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders"". The first half of each one-hour episode is dedicated to the initial revelation of a crime and the police investigation that subsequently takes place. This usually involves interviewing witnesses, following leads, testing evidence, and/or hammering out a confession. Once sufficient evidence has been gathered to charge a suspect, the remainder of the show revolves around the district attorney's office and their attempts to prosecute the offenders. Oftentimes, the audience will be witness to unexpected plot twists, unorthodox media-driven cases, or last minute, Perry Mason-like confessions or brokered deals. Given its long TV run, the cast of Law & Order has frequently changed over the years - with only a handful of characters experiencing lengthy runs, characters such as Det. Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach), Lt. Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson), and EADA John ""Jack"" McCoy (Sam Waterston)...

The Law & Order (Season 1) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the series premiere ""Prescription for Death"" in which a young woman turns up dead following a late-night visit to the emergency room. When her father claims negligence on behalf of the hospital, his accusations lead to an in-depth investigation that prompts detectives to believe that the attending physician was drunk at the time of treatment... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Poison Ivy"" in which the police shooting (and subsequent cover-up) of a black honors student amplifies the city's racial tensions, and ""The Serpent's Tooth"" in which two brothers become the prime suspects in the murder of their wealthy parents...

1454622,5,B00005JLFV,"L&O is my favorite drama and I would guess if you are thinking about the DVD, you already like the series.  You can tell this is early in the show, because there are little things that have since disappeared, like the theme music over shots of the detectives in their car, etc.

A feature on this set that I particularly like is the ""play"" which is really play all.  Pop the DVD in, hit Play and the episodes will just keep running until you tell it to stop, which is great for when I play it in the background while doing other things.

1454623,4,B00005JLFV,"""Law and Order: The First Year"" is about as good a start to a police drama as anyone could have hoped for, meaning there are some kinks in the formula but overall the bedrock for a fantastic show. I am an enthusiastic viewer of the later years, but there are some ways in which this season is sharply different and admittedly superior. The basic formula is the same: the first half of each show is devoted to the investigation and arrest, the second half to the prosecution, but there are subtle differences in the impact and direction of the stories that make the First year worth buying even if you've seen every one of the last six seasons.
The show is much more personal than its later incarnation. This may have something to do with the impossibility of keeping a stable cast (all of the lead and supporting actors from this season were gone by season six, and many of their replacements have since been replaced) or simply a desire to keep the show fiercely unique from dramas like NYPD Blue. Either way, I think the decision has lengthened the shelf-life of the show, but has left very little room to get to know the current characters. In this season I don't think the creators were intent on keeping the episodes all story-driven with very little character development. The events have a personal effect on the characters and influence the way they handle their jobs; Sgt. Greevey's (George Dzundza) and Detective Logan's (Chris Noth) differing views on abortion are a feature of the ""Life Choice"" episode, a development that would never happen in seasons Eleven through Fourteen.  The pacing is slower and feels less like a deliberate compression-- there is more a sense of a complete and human story rather than the quick and  inexorable grinding of Justice's wheels in the later years.
In this atmosphere of greater freedom and personality for the characters, good actors really shine. Michael Moriarty is excellent as the relentless ADA Stone, Noth and Dzundza show flashes, and Dan Florek (Captain Kragan) and Steven Hill (DA Adam Schiff) frequently steal scenes.
""Law and Order- the First Year"" has flaws that go beyond its fifteen year old vision of pop culture, however. (Think late 80s/early 90s clothes, hairdos, and rap music) The stories are chock-full of 'important' statements; some episodes could simply have titles like ""RACE"" and ""ABORTION""-- they pursue one hot-button issue after another, presumably to hook viewers onto a new and unique premise. This kind of writing can hit a home run, but can also strike out completely, as in the episode ""Half Light"". In the effort to put their stamp on the defining social problems of their day, the writers often get preachy and awkward. Even in the absence of a ""heavy-hitting"" social issue, outrage and grief are not left in the hands of the actors or scenes to convey without words-- there are several moments when an actor is basically standing there explaining to us what we should be feeling. As the show became ""veteran"", these problems disappeared, but here in the very first season, they are on display. The dialogue in general is frequently stilted. It's a shame-- when they're given a chance, the actors often prove quite capable of natural and believable banter. While the acting is generally good, there are moments in which Dzundza as Sgt. Greevey is trying way too hard and overdoes it. Richard Brooks (as ADA Robinette)is just plain bad. Anytime he's asked to deliver more emotion than his general stoic exterior, the most he can do is squint and grimace. It can be painful to watch.
Overall, it is impressive to bask in the vision that launched this brilliant show. There are uncertain moments, inevitable with any ground-breaking series that is trying to find its feet, but the acting, personal element, and fresh take on certain social problems overcome these limitations. The show may not quite have an identity yet, but even that can be a plus-- there are moments of singular brilliance in this first Year that would never see the light of day in the very fast-paced and established formula of the later seasons. It's a real treat.",1107129600,4,4120,4.842553191489362
1454624,5,B00005JLFV,"When I was quite young, I didn't think it was POSSIBLE for Television to ever approach the quality of one drama: Hill Street Blues. While I still LOVE and watch that great show, LAW AND ORDER surprised me in rising from the mire of 90's television [along with NYPD BLUE] to elevate television drama to an even higher level.

What makes LAW AND ORDER ""the best""? In my view, it is the ""resolution"" within each episode. We aren't given a window into the ""personal lives"" of the principals, and each episode ""begins and ends"" within the 60 minute confines.

Even with this ""formula"", the principal characters do NOT come across as ""stiff"" or ""strangers"": through the best writing since HILL STREET, and great acting, I feel a much deeper ""connection"" to them than the ""mawkish"" delivery in other dramas [especially ""ER"" and that horrible Anthony Edwards]. The ""passing comments"" about their beliefs and lives- related to the cases, speak volumes about the soul of each character. This also has to be  the best directed TV show in history- even better than HILL STREET.

LAW AND ORDER has spawned ""spinoffs"" in ""SVU"" and ""Criminal Intent""; I LOVE SVU as much as the original [what male could NOT love a show with ""Olivia""? I keep hoping for an episode of her in shorts or a mini-skirt!!] as it has the same grainy, ""no non-sense"" directive as the original. Criminal Intent, I think, sucks. Vincent D'onofrio is ""set-up"" as Columbo ""super-cop"" without the ""big picture"" involvement of the other two shows.

I hope the Original and SVU continue for years to come [let's lose Criminal INtent], with return shows with Chris Noth. God rest Jerry Orbach's soul, as I grew to love ""Lenny"" through the years!!

For true Law and Order fans, there is no better way to enjoy watching your favorite early episodes than on this DVD.  However, in a way it is almost sad to see all of the old characters that are no longer on the show, but it is sure nice to see them again!

1454708,4,B00005JLFV,"The first season of Law and Order lacks the bang-bang short attention span plot advances and twists of the later years, but more than makes up for it by deeper plots and better acting, along with some nice background.  Unfortunately, the DVD quality isn't what it could be, which is why this is 4 stars and not 5.
From season 3 or 4 on, the Law and Order formula came into full flower.  Every 'donk-donk' signifies a quick advance in the plot as a year-long investigation and trial gets compressed in an hour, except for those delicious times when it reverses in a wild plot twist.  Three spinoffs prove this works regardless of who is in the role.  Season 1 isn't quite like that.  For instance, it often meanders slowly, spending 4 or 5 minutes at the beginning actually witnessing the crime, having the cast walk down the street talking to each other rather than going from one interview to the next.  (This actually gives some great background - you finally see the full precinct room and DAs office!)  The slower pace even reflects in the way the guest stars seemly act - an L&O trademark is to have an interviewee continuing to do their job while the cops grill them.  Not so here.  No quick hot dog lunch for meetings between the Captain and the detectives.  Logan even complains when someone doesn't give them their full attention!
While not having the formula down means that action slows down, it allows for better acting and better plot development.  The 'ripped from the headlines' aspect remains as large as it ever was, with the Mayflower Madam, Tawana Brawley claiming rape, the Lisa Steinberg child abuse case, and city council corruption along with several cop corruption cases.  The difference is that because the actors aren't forced to move through hoops they actually get to perform.  Robinette gives a soul searing performance in the the Brawley case (Half-Light) and the corruption case (Bagman) as he examines his race versus his job - and race and class in general get explored a lot more than in later years (in episodes like Homeboy Blues and Poison Ivy.)  Logan acts like a rookie as he screams at people who don't help him, and nearly comes to blows with Greevey over their views on abortion and morality in Life Choice and Kiss the Girls.  Stone shows actual rage in Indifference, and Schiff is a motivated caring boss and not just his normal fun cantankerous let's-cut-our-losses self.  Finally, the caliber of the guest stars before they became big (Cynthia Nixon, William Macy, Epatha Merkerson!) helps as the give and take is unrestrained.  This is a fair tradeoff for a slower show.
My only objection to the DVD set is the transfer is somewhat mediocre, especially for the first few episodes where you get flecking.  I can't believe the original tapes weren't in better shape.  Also, the features side borders on the unacceptable. Dick Wolf does talk about the original development of the show, for about 10 minutes.  Other than that, nothing - except for an unbelievable ad about the Law and Order game!  I can't believe there aren't outtakes or they couldn't get someone from the cast to walk through the episodes ala the Simpsons DVD sets.  Definitely worth marking down a star for that.
Still, a great beginning to a great show.",1082160000,73,3267,4.745132743362832

1454712,4,B00005JLFV,"Although ""Law & Order"" has been on television since 1991, I did not watch my first episode until sometime in 2000 (this would have been during the time that Angie Harmon played ADA Abbie Carmichael). I saw three or four episodes that year, and did not watch it again until 2002. At that point, I became a very dedicated fan and have not missed an episode since.
I was certainly in for an awakening when I started watching the first 22 episodes from ""Law & Order""'s premier 1990 season.
It is obvious from watching these episodes that Law & Order was ahead of its time. I can see why some people were turned off. Many of the topics the show touched on in this inagural season had rarely, if ever, been done before: AIDS assisted suicide; sadomasochism; abortion clinic bombings; gang rape; kidney theft.
As is to be expected of a series' freshman year, the writing was loose (no where near as tight as it is today). Many episodes contained lines that were out-of-place, like they had just appeared out of nowhere for no particular reason. In addition, there were quite a few episodes, especially during the first part of the season, where there were awkward silences, almost like someone was suppose to say something but forgot.
Although the familiar split format between the law and order sides were here, there were some differences, especially on the order side. Several of the episodes showed the DAs either in the grand jury room or continuing the investigation portion of the case. It was not too uncommon for very little action to occur in the courtroom itself.
Acting wise, the order side handily won the case against the law side. George Dzundza (Sgt. Max Greevey) and Chris Noth (Det. Mike Logan) never quite managed to find the right chemistry. In addition, Dan Florek (Capt. Donald Cragen, now portraying the same character on ""Law & Order: SVU) didn't seem quite sure of himself during the first half of the season, although he did settle into his character later on. Michael Moriarty (ADA Benjamin Stone), Richard Brooks (ADA Paul Robinette), and Stephen Hill (DA Adam Schiff) not only found their characters early on, but also figured out how they relate to each other. The disparity in acting between the two sides would often make the law side drag on while the order side generally flew right by.
Despite the differences, I am glad I have seen the origins of this great TV-drama. It will be fun to catch up on the other seasons I have missed to see the transformation of what this show used to be into what it is now.",1070582400,4,2534,4.658482142857143
1454713,5,B00005JLFV,"Ah...what might have been for Law and Order, if only they hadn't messed with the original concept by adding a few ""pretty people"". The first and second season casts are the best. George Dzunda (later replaced by Paul Sorvino), Chris Noth, Richard Brooks, Michael Moriarty, Dann Florek and Steven Hill was the best all-around cast the show has seen.
Granted, S. Epatha Merkerson and Sam Waterston were great finds. However, the parade of pretty assistant D.A.'s, topped off with the latest, Elizabeth Rohm, who can't act...period, has really done injustice to this show.
Of course, it happens all the time...great shows, decimated by some [person] in the board room who wants to broaden the shows' appeal...while alienating the base audience.
But...I digress. This is a set to have, as these were ""Law & Order"" how it was meant to be.",1065571200,6,833,4.957142857142857

1454715,5,B00005JLFV,"I began watching Law and Order when I was in eighth grade and have been a loyal viewer ever since. I have seen nearly every episode and at one point could name every actor who ever starred in the show and their character's name. I think that, although the show is heavily story-driven, it is the chemistry between the leads that makes the show so memorable, as well as the great storytelling and the intriguing look at morality and politics.
The show's chemistry wasn't what it was in later seasons. The show would hit its stride once Jerry Orbach came on as Lenny Briscoe in the show's third season. Nevertheless, it was not due to bad acting. George Dzundza has always been great and he is definitely believable, if not incredible, as Detective Max Greevey.  Chris Noth was very memorable (especially with Orbach) as Mike Logan, a hotheaded cop who would eventually be outed for assaulting a man in public. Dann Florek played Captain Cragen, a perfect CO that supported his people but was also tough enough so that they would get the job done. On the Order side, we have Michael Moriarty, Richard Brooks, and Stephen Hill. Moriarty was great in his years as ADA Ben Stone, especially in his confrontations with frequent defense attourney Green. That relationship always dripped with conflict. Brooks played Paul Robinette, Stone's partner. He would occasionally give performances of great power, such as the episode in which he is forced to come to terms with one of his African-American heroes being a corrupt swindler (Subterranean Homeboy Blues). Stephen Hill was the heart of the series for many years, always bringing the legal matters into perspective, often with a bit of wry humor. One of the show's most beloved characters of all time, he is at his best here as DA Adam Schiff, helping Stone appropriate justice fairly and responsibly.
The show's first season occasionally produced some truly fantastic episodes. Indifference, for one, is unforgettable. It has been a favorite of mine ever since I bought the VHS collection a few years ago. It is a truly haunting, disturbing look at a very depraved and irresponsible man. The aforementioned Subterranean Homeboy Blues, also, is fantastic.
The Reaper's Helper is a painfully provocative episode about AIDS and euthanasia. By Hooker, By Crook is also an interesting look at a call-girl ring.
All in all, Law and Order not only rips from the headlines, it also precedes them. I remember watching a show on pedophile priests from the early nineties that I couldn't help but remember when the scandal broke last year. This show deserves to be in your DVD library.",1065139200,20,2620,4.900900900900901

1454786,4,B00005JLFV,"I first saw an episode of L&O on Irish television about nine years ago. For some reason I had the impression it was a soap opera, so hadn't started viewing it properly. I was particularly impressed by the depth, complexity and intelligence of the episode, but had assumed that this was just a fluke, and nothing could be that consistently good.
I was completely mistaken.
L&O does not concentrate on the personal lives of characters, but has marvellous acting, ingenious, dense plots and excellent direction.
Why not 5 stars? Well, this first series is slightly dated (unsurprising for episodes recorded 13 years ago). For example there is little use made of forensics, DNA testing, and obviously the computer references seem archaic. Also the cases which give inspiration are quite old (for example there is an episode which seems to be based on the 1984 Bernard Goetz case).
And in one or two cases the episode scripts simply do not come up to scratch (By Hooker By Crook is particularly weak, and it is not clear what the defendant is being charged with).
Apart from the occasional Ted Post power chords, and some of the women's fashions (The men, wearing suits for the most part get off more lightly), the presentation stands up very well. And the performances and direction are excellent.

1454788,4,B00005JLFV,"The first season of NBC's long running Law & Order is a solid, but not spectacular season.  The show's now familiar format of telling the story from the police side in the first half-hour and lawyers side in the second half-hour is intact, but the show hadn't found its footing.  That's not to say that these shows aren't any good (they are), they just don't measure up to the incredible high standards that the series set in later seasons.  The police side is made up of Chris Noth as Mike Logan, George Dzundza as Max Greevey and Dann Florek as Don Cragen and the law side is made of Michael Moriarty as Ben Stone, Richard Brooks as Paul Robinette and Steven Hill as Adam Schiff.  Mr. Noth's & Mr. Dzundza's characters never really click.  Obviously the producers thought so as well as Mr. Dzundza's character is killed off the show and was replaced by Paul Sorvino in season two.  The teaming of Mr. Moriarty & Mr. Brooks works better and their work is more fruitful.  The two season one standouts are Mr. Hill & Mr. Florek.  Mr. Hill would enjoy the longest run of any character on the show and his work from season one on was exemplary.  He was the rock of the show and his absence has been felt since he left.  Mr. Hill was not the original choice to play the D.A., the failed pilot that was produced for CBS appears as episode six and Roy Thinnes played the D.A. Alfred Wentworth.  Series creator and producer Dick Wolf made an incredibly wise decision to employ Mr. Hill in the D.A. role.  Mr. Florek plays Captain Cragen with perfect balance.  He is a by-the-books cop who stands by his men, but adds a sense of humor to tense situations.  He was also missed upon his departure after the third season and Mr. Wolf wisely revived the character for series spin-off Law & Order: SVU.  Season one also features a plethora of then unknown actors who would rise to fame in either television or films including William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, Patricia Clarkson, Christine Baranski, Courtney B. Vance, Gil Bellows, future co-star of Mr. Noth on Sex & The City, Cynthia Nixon, Six Feet Under star Frances Conroy and future Sopranos stars Dominic Chianese and Aida Turturro.

1454789,3,B00005JLFV,"""Law and Order"" is the ground-breaking, record-breaking police/lawyer drama that's developed such a religious following in recent years that its spawned several television spin offs.  At last we get the original series as it premiered back in the late eighties and sporting a box set that is rather impressive, considering it comes from Universal Studios - a studio not known for going ""all out"" on a t.v. series. This box set gives us all 24 episodes from season one.  Some of the best, and most disturbing moments are featured herein, including a child molestation segment, thought to be so emotionally disturbing that, after its initial broadcast, for six years afterward, was never aired on network prime time again.  How times have changed!
Over all, the image quality of these discs is fairly good.  Some episodes have a considerable amount of film grain present. However, I suspect this is not only the fault of the original elements used in taping the episode, but due, in part, to the lesser quality of equipment used in television productions nearly thirteen years ago.  Colors are muted and dated but they are well balanced. Flesh tones are accurately presented. Black levels are solid. Contrast levels are generally good, though a few episodes seem to have considerably lower levels than the norm. Edge enhancement and pixelization are generally kept to a minimum, though they are present throughout the series.  The audio is remastered and well presented, only occasionally sounding strident.
Extras: a little mini-documentary from Dick Wolf, the producer and some trailer junkets.
BOTTOM LINE: If you're a fan of this great television series you should seriously consider adding this box set to your collection.",1051228800,16,1725,5.164874551971326
1454790,5,B00005JLFV,"Thanks to my wife, I have become a Law & Order addict. This DVD set contains the 22 episodes of the first season of this show that has become an institution. A rather simple formula for each hour episode: the first half of the story shows the police action [Law], and the second segment of each episode covers the court trial [Order, in the court!]. The first season's cast is wonderful, but the fact that the show is still alive and strong, with a totally different cast, proves the power of the formula.
There is much to be said for watching the show without commercials; you can better appreciate the tight story lines and the wonderful writing, without a bunch of annoying commercials popping up every few minutes.
Everything works wonderfully on this show-- the great music by Mike Post, the opening narration, the formula of seeing the crime before the opening credits. The joys and challenges of life as a NY cop and life in the DA's office are artfully portrayed (and interestingly, we learn almost nothing about the personal lives of the characters). Note that there is very little on-screen violence here, even though violence is a key driver in many episodes. You will notice the absence of violence when you observe, in one episode, a storekeeper being beaten up--it is quite a shock, and makes you realize that the violence is usually just suggested (or it happens before the viewer is brought into the scene).
It is a lot of fun to notice who pops up in some of the small parts or one-episode roles. My favorite is Frances Conroy, the mother on Six Feet Under, who plays a high-class, horrid dominatrix. Cynthia Nixon plays someone quite different from her Sex and the City persona (and it is funny to see her with Chris Noth, who grows up to be Mr. Big). Also watch for Peter Frechette, Gil Bellows, Mandy Patinkin, Faith Prince, Courtney Vance, Camryn Manheim, John Spencer, William H. Macy, Andrew McCarthy, Ron Rifkin, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, Frances Sternhagen, S. Epatha Merkerson (in a small role, not related at all to her later starring role), Christine Baranski, plus scores and scores of New York City actors and actresses in bit parts.
Some of the recurring roles are marvelous; my personal favorite is Lorraine Toussaint, whom we first meet in Episode 2, as the in-your-face defense attorney Shambala Green.
L & O has given birth to several spin-offs, and it continues to dominate in its thirteenth season. I strongly recommend this DVD, whether you are a first time viewer or faithful addict as I have become.

The first season features an entirely different cast from the current program and story lines that are more intense, raw and unpredictable than the watered-down L&O of today.  The characters of Ben Stone and Mike Logan are particularly interesting, as many fans labeled them the ""heart and soul,"" of the series.  Often times, we find that we know who is guilty within the first 20 minutes of the show and the moral complications come in.  This is best exemplified in the episodes, ""Subterranean Homeboy Blues,"" ""Life-Choice,"" and ""Indifference.""  It is also neat to see recurring characters such as the fiery Shambala Green and the cop's cop, Tony Profaci.  These supporting players, along with the main cast, had personality and helped drive the show, unlike their bland, cardboard counterparts of today.  Although the show is focused on the plot, we get small glimpses into the personal lives and personalities of the characters through incidental dialogue.
