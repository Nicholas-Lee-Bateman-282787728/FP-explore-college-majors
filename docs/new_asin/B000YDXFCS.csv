8279649,1,B000YDXFCS,"My experience living in and working in the islands of Samoa gave me great insight into the significant role religion plays in the Samoan culture. There is by no means any major animosity toward the Mormon's. Speaking with Catholics (Kataliko), Methodists (Metitiso), London Missionary Society (LMS), and the Mormons all of them seem to be in agreement that the Mormons are most fair.

The leaders of the first 3 religious groups were given land by chiefs. Generations later that land is rented back to the villagers to live on. Those renting the land are required to attend the church of the parish. The Mormons arrived much later and purchased land, which when not in use is allowed to be used by local villagers to live on rent free.

This is a good video for those looking for a propaganda to use against the Mormons.",1388361600,13,820,4.6875
