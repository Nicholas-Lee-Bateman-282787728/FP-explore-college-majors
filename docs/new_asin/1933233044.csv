203207,5,1933233044,"I've seen this video more than a dozen times at the Arch. However, my grandchildren were visiting and I took them to the Arch, but the lines were long. They asked a lot of questions that I knew were answered in the video, so ordered it and the (10 and 8) loved it as did the rest of the family. It was only later with 50th anniversary celebrations in STL that I realized some aspects were not included in the video. There was no mention of the Percy Green protests over the number of minority employees that was part of the fabric of the building of the Arch that was not included. They certainly should be as a discussion of the Old Courthouse and the Dred Scott decision was equally riveting to the grandchildren when we visited.",1375574400,,731,4.343065693430657
203208,5,1933233044,I find this fascinating.  I had it as a VHS tape years ago and bought this on DVD.  It was much cheaper to get it from Amazon than at the Arch gift shop.  It offers an amazing and poignant description of the building of this monument.,1374624000,,234,4.043478260869565
203209,5,1933233044,"Wonderful DVD that shows the amazing and safe construction of the St. Louis Archway built in a very short time.
My husband loved our visit to the Archway and the video shown there so bought the DVD as a gift.  He has shown it to his buddies who were also wowed.",1351036800,2,261,4.117647058823529
203210,5,1933233044,"The video shows some absolutely great footage of the construction of the Arch in St. Louis.
It is totally impressive, and speaks directly to the tremendous challenges and ingenuity involved in the project.  A very worthwhile historical piece for anyone who enjoys videos involving the actual construction phase of our country's various landmarks.",1314748800,2,346,5.528301886792453
203211,5,1933233044,"Everyone should visit the St. Louis Arch and marvel at what good man is capable of producing. My father was in charge of designing the creeper crane for Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co. Seeing the blueprints, watching the brave workers construct the arch piece by piece and knowing that this feat was accomplished safely is truly a thrill. My family and I never tire of viewing this film.",1311465600,,387,4.791044776119403

7801678,5,1933233044,"This is a great DVD for those interested in American history, the Arch, St. Louis or great filmmaking. While visiting the Arch for the 50th anniversary in October 2015, I bought a copy from the gift shop underneath the monument. The gift shop charges $25, so if you're buying enough goodies on Amazon to eschew the shipping charges, you're getting a deal. My maternal grandfather and namesake, Walter R. Riggle, was a Class A Welder at the Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co. shop in Warren, Pennsylvania, 700 miles from St. Louis. The PDM-Warren shop is where the above-ground wedge components were fabricated. There is footage of the Warren shop, and its workers, in Mr. Guggenheim's movie. I just staged a showing of this DVD to a meeting of former PDM employees and they could identify some of the faces in that shop. Walt Riggle never lived to see the actual Arch standing, but now you can see it being fabricated and erected in all its glory. Walt died on the job in the PDM shop of a heart attack at age 54. The only minor flaws I can see in the film are (1: the Warren shop is never mentioned by name in the film, which is a matter of local pride; and (2: this is only a standard-definition DVD; I wish it were available in high-definition. As the original Guggenheim movie was shot on actual film, I would expect that ""remastering"" the movie to make it available as either a Blu-Ray or as a hi-def download or stream would be fairly easy to accomplish. It's still a top-notch film for those interested in the Arch, in PDM, in St. Louis, or in history in general. It's also a great keeper for those interesting in the industrial history of north-western Pennsylvania, where those wedge components were fabricated.",1449532800,,1717,4.61437908496732
7801679,4,1933233044,If you're a history buff (or not) - -  this is a great documentary to view.  I used to show it to my drafting students on the high school level on a 16 mm projector.,1426377600,,165,3.6857142857142855

7801681,5,1933233044,"I watched the building of the St. Louis Gateway Arch from the time ground was broken in February 1963 until it's completion in 1965. The day in October of that year when they hoisted the final keystone piece to the top, I was in a High School classroom. Our instructor brought in a portable TV, sat it on his desk, and told us, ""We are NOT having class today. Instead, we are going to watch the final piece of the Gateway Arch being set into place!"" What a thrill that was! Later on, as the first museum was being constructed under the monument, I was able to watch ""Monument to the Dream"". To this day, I have never seen a documetary keep me on the edge of my seat such as this one did...and still does. That particular day was my very first ride to the top of the Arch. Many rides have been taken by me, my wife and family and friends since. I recommend this video to each and every St. Louisan, no, each and every American. It is well worth taking the 30 minutes of your time to see this Gateway to the West Monument being built!",1410220800,,1032,4.165
