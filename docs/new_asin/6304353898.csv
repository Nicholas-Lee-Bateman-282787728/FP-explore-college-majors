7870277,5,6304353898,Another good crime drama from the nineties. I watched a lot of movies from 2010 - 2018 then 2000 - 2009 but the nineties movies were all excellent. I started out wanting 16:9 for anything. I also was obsessed with 5.1 surround sound. Now the best movies are 4:3 with stereo. Amazon Prime facilitated my determining what I really wanted. This movie had good action and violence and that is my top two priority parameters. In this movie I like that there was plenty of shooting. I like the punching and kicking. I will continue on the list to find another movie like this and then another.,1520294400,,587,4.4953271028037385

I don't think this is an original ?",1449964800,,265,3.732142857142857

7870280,5,6304353898,"I love martial arts films...I am collecting as many of these types of films as possible... I love everything that has the Venoms in it, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Ti Lung, Alexander Fu Sheng, Gordon Liu and many more...I can't get enough of!!!!",1429747200,,238,4.558139534883721
7870281,3,6304353898,"After watching numerous movies staring Ti Lung you tend to get familar with his choragraphed fighting style movies like Avenging Eagles, Blood Brothers, and Sentimental Sword are just of few of the great ones. This one has a fair story yet plenty of fight scenes but not at the high level that I know Ti is capable of doing.",1184025600,,324,4.508474576271187
7870282,3,6304353898,"Despite knowing that this film is presented in full frame and not remastered, I took a chance as so many of my favourite Shaw stars are in it - Ling Yun, Shih Sze and Ti Lung. I also wanted to see what Hsu Feng was capable of doing. The first impression is that the image is clearer than expected. But I was not prepared for the English dubbing. What horrible accent is that? American, British or something in between? The production values are terrible....definitely not up to the high standard set by Shaw Brothers. Shih Sze is wasted in a non-fighting role. Ti Lung is too old to play a lad and Hsu Feng looks fat. But my hero Ling Yun is still good and his performance alone is worth the price I paid for this dvd. I hope this film will be remastered and released in Mandarin in cinemascope one day.",1115164800,2,803,4.2894736842105265
7870283,4,6304353898,"I'll try to keep this short.  The Revenger is an older, ""classic"" kung-fu flick.  A very, very brief and approximate synopsis:  A free-lance fighter resists the ""unionization"", if you will, of the fighters in his province.  The evil leader and his fighters ambush the good guy to do away with him.  18 years later, his son goes on a quest to gather all of his fathers bones, which apparently rest with each of the fighters that ambushed him.

What's unusual about this film is that most of the combat is done with various weapons.  If you have a favorite martial arts weapon, it's probably in this movie (although I was disappointed that the fan fight was so short).  The sets in this movie look great, as do the costumes, creating a very colorful film that is pleasing to the eye.

The quality of the DVD is ok.  The transfer is full-frame.  While the film is not re-mastered, most of the film is quite vibrantly colored.

In summery: great martial arts film, good dvd, excellent addition to your collection.",992736000,6,1009,4.606741573033708
7870284,2,6304353898,"This Hong Kong kung fu film from 1979 offers a more complicated cross-generational plot than usual as a group of children seen in a prologue and flashbacks reunite, all grown up, to get revenge for crimes committed against their parents. Star Ti Lung plays both a father and his grown son in separate scenes. Although the English dubbing is terrible, there is a very nice score of original Chinese music. The photography and set design are above average, although the plot does get confusing. It all culminates in a big, gimmicky battle in a palace as the grown children take on evil master Wang Ching (a perennial villain in these films). Other kung fu greats in the cast include female star Hsu Feng and high-kicker Tan Tao Liang.",984441600,,732,4.7265625
7870285,3,6304353898,"In SHAOLIN KUNG FU MYSTAGOGUE (1976), the fights feature more exaggerated stunts and special effects than normal for a mid-70s kung fu film. There is greater use of gimmicky weapons, including an amazing device that opens up to 3 blades and flies, slices through trees (and human bodies), and returns to its owner like a boomerang. There is also more high leaping than usual for the time, both recalling the ""wuxia"" swordplay films of the 1960s and foreshadowing the ""wire fu"" trend of the early 1990s.
The fights are generally well-staged and shot and are skillfully worked into the complex intrigue of a plotline focused on Ming patriots seeking to protect their leader from Ching guards and spies in 1640s China. The low-budget production design is actually quite impressive. The worthy cast is led by Hsu Feng (as a high-jumping swordswoman), Carter Wong, Kam Kong, and Lung Fei. Hsu Feng is better known for her work in several earlier King Hu films, including A TOUCH OF ZEN and THE FATE OF LEE KHAN.",984009600,2,1006,4.820809248554913
7870286,2,6304353898,"I bought this movie through Amazon because Arnold Vosloo was in it. For any Vosloo fan you should at least rent it. It's nice to see Arnold in any movie, but he is only in it for about 15 min-the story line isn't bad. A  sax player meets up with an old friend(Arnold)and unknowingly gets into his  troubles and tries to get his life back.",949708800,,338,4.184615384615385
