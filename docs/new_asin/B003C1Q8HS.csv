It was filmed and edited by students.  I know the production isn't amazing but you also aren't paying $60-$150 like you would for a professionally filmed/edited demo.  Those who watch the video in its entirety should come away with some very useful information/skills.  You might consider renting this title first to see if you like it.  I also might suggest that the same info is found in my full color book about painting the still life.  You might find that useful as well, and perhaps easier to flip back and forth rather than fast forward and rewind ;-)",1527120000,,717,4.476923076923077
8394072,1,B003C1Q8HS,"The instructor was knowledgeable, but it was so amateurishly presented and filmed, I couldn't believe I had to pay for it!  The camera didn't show both the still life and the painting- so most of the time one couldn't get any idea how to take the painting tips and apply them to use.",1424390400,,283,4.339622641509434
