5005440,5,B006MJEOIM,"Good CLEAN Canadian series about a deaf woman, Sue, who works for the FBI because of her lip reading abilities.  The series is based on a real-life woman who did work for the FBI (& even cameos in an episode during the second season).  It is a procedural, but has a fun group of characters making up the team that Sue works with.  Sue also has a hearing dog, Levi, who is part of the team.  I enjoyed the series and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean TV show.",1455235200,3,476,4.086021505376344

5005444,5,B006MJEOIM,"Our whole family enjoys this show.  No cursing, no promiscuity, but good stories that hold our attention and keep us interested....from the grown-ups used to shows like NCIS to the young teen who doesn't like anything too scary.  This show also helps us to see a little into the life of a deaf person and the difficulties they must deal with and how we are not that different.  The story lines do not always focus on the main character and  her disability but also the lives of the other characters.  The writers include ideas like grace, forgiveness, kindness, marital faithfulness in the shows and this is refreshing.  The acting is good and especially by the star Deanna Bray.  There were real tears in some of the scenes. We only wish there were more seasons.",1442016000,3,763,4.649253731343284

5005472,5,B006MJEOIM,"Unlike some made for TV series which start wonderful and quickly peter out or take an unexpected (and undesired twist) as the author's 'real' worldview comes into play, this series started great and stayed great (at least through Vol 1 which is all I have seen). The episodes are well written with enough action to keep an adult engaged and enjoying them yet safe enough for most grade schoolers.",1398470400,5,396,4.753623188405797
5005473,4,B006MJEOIM,"I always enjoyed this show when it was on the air and was THRILLED when it finally came out on DVD!

5005476,5,B006MJEOIM,"I love shows with mystery themes. Most FBI type shows on TV have a lot of violence and blood shed. Sue Thomas not only tells the story of an amazing woman, but they solve their case without showing gory scenes.

5005482,5,B006MJEOIM,"If I could give out 10 stars, I definitely would for this series.  These are our most borrowed dvds, and they are nearly worn out.  We have finally convinced others to buy their own set.  This series has our wholesome recommendation because there is an absence of profanity, nudity, and sex.  Instead, the work place is wholesome,the camaraderie is fun, and God is reverently acknowledged.  I have taught my children sign language since they were little, so they enjoy the signing in this series, too.  These episodes are fun to watch for the whole family.  I appeal to the producers, PLEASE PRODUCE MORE FILMS OF THIS NATURE!",1380672000,,626,4.794392523364486
5005483,5,B006MJEOIM,"We love this series.  For a change, a movie series my kids can watch with me with out all of the crude humor, filth and swearing.  FYI:  There are still families out there who want a family-friendly movie that does not include, nudity, sexual inuendos, cussing, crude humor, and all of those other Non - Christian possibilities for entertainment!
With that said, I have not seen ALL of the series, but so far so good.  I have heard from some friends that it is a pretty good full series.",1377907200,,487,4.438202247191011

5005485,5,B006MJEOIM,My only complaint is the quality of the discs.  One would not even load and several others had problems.  I did return the 5-volume set and then bought individual volumes.  There is still some minor clichs but I can live with them.,1375142400,,231,4.4523809523809526
