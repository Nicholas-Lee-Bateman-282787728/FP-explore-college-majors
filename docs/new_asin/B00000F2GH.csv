Not only as shown by previous reviews does it show how human pragmatics in law and our attempts to design a just reality fail the ideals of humanity, but reveals a basic unavoidable contradiction with idealistic hope and pessimistic thought that are part of the reality we face.  Pragmatically, logically and leagally this is reavling portayal of the mechanics of existence. This movie seems to be a post modern quintessential.",1071705600,7,486,4.987654320987654

I graduated and went to law school, now I am among the top 11% of lawyers in the country [Martindale-Hubbell ""av""] and the story this movie tells still sticks in my mind as the perfect example of why the law can not always achieve justice.

Can he bring himself to complete his job even though he doesn't want to do it?  Can he bring himself to carry out justice even though Billy was provoked and was totally justified in his crime?  This is type of movie that will make you think about basic facts of human nature.

Shown on TV infrequently and never (as far as I know) screened at revival houses, this film works on all levels.  Acting, directing, plot, dialogue, suspense, drama and even comedy.  The ending is absolutely incredible.  You'll be thinking about it for days.
For those who have read the book (I have not), apparently Peter Ustinov does not play Capt. Veere as Melville might have intended.  Still, compare his sytle, his delivery, etc to other performances of the era...it stands apart.

1200582,4,B00000F2GH,"Peter Ustinov's exciting movie of Melville's great story is lean, stripped for action & beautiful to look at.  If only it were mean as well.  Melville's triangular tale of evil has been reduced to 2 sides leaving all the nuances excised & the reverberations silenced.  Unlike Melville's tale, when this movie is over it's over.  At the heart of the problem is Peter Ustinov.  His radical surgery removed Melville's audacious suggestion that evil undisguised, like poison, is rendered harmless by its knowability.  But how does one protect one's self from 'pretty poison'?  Ustinov's Starry Vere is everybody's favourite uncle.  No sulphur fumes here.  Melvyn Douglas as Dansker gives such a sly, knowing performance that he seems ideal for the role of Vere.  He might have put back all the ambiguities & nuances Ustinov removed.  Terence Stamp making his screen debut makes a sensational Billy & he earned himself a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.  (Years later he would play a similiar role in Pasolini's THEOREMA.)  Robert Ryan's Claggart is magnificent.  His evil is worthy of Melville; it's almost Miltonian.  In the flogging scene, which had everyone talking when the movie first opened, when he realizes the last stripe was laid on he looks like Jesse Helms learning a cure for AIDS has been found.",1036713600,12,1312,5.065420560747664

1200615,3,B00000F2GH,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I read Melville's novel in High School and recall being extremely affected by the comparison of evil vs innocence as one and the same menace. After watching the film adaptation, I have even stronger feelings of the incompetent writing which may or may not be Melville's.

With only one witness to the death of the 'Evil Grinch', and a committee very willing to corroborate evidence and a 'Get Out of Jail Card', how does the Law and Justice speech make any sense? The Captain leaves it solely to the 'Man from Uncle' to justify bending the rules, but the entire film does just that, beginning to end. How can you support such weak characters when there were limited repercussions to the acquittal vs high mutiny potential?

Of course this alternate version of Karma and dying for someone else's sins may have a corollary or two in literature, but the figures just don't add up. First, this lovely lad was not trying to take over the ship, judge or insult anyone, or scare them into fear mongering morons. When really bad things happen to extremely good people you can only empathize with the scenario in a non-fiction setting. Otherwise, the constant sadistic behavior rewarded in the end is most annoying and irrational. Rate Melville as a rank amateur if you will, but decidedly not a Spielberg emotionally manipulating hack.

I had to prepare a report on this book so long ago and I asked my sweet boyfriend to write it for me while I attended to other higher priority projects. I got into a lot of hot water for that stint as he just copied the Cliff notes. I sadly lost an opportunity to express many personal observations that I experienced several times in my life. Apologies, mostly to myself.

1200634,4,B00000F2GH,"Billy Budd, 1962 film

This takes place in 1797, the year of mutinies in the British Navy. We hear the names and jobs of the seamen. A British warship want to inspect a merchant ship. A cannon commands attention to the commander to stop. They can impress seamen from any ship, and they take Billy Budd. One sailor is flogged as punishment. What was his crime? Billy meets the other sailors; he stammers. There is a fight, Billy wins. Making friends quickly is a good quality says the Master at Arms. There is an incident when a bowl of food falls. Claggart insults Jenkins. The crew hates Claggart. [The talk suggests a stage play.] Jenkins feels sick but stands his watch. An enemy ship is sighted! Battle Stations! They set more canvas. A man falls to the deck! They fire at the French ship, which escapes. Hand in your arms.

The Captain tells the sailors their job is to obey. How did that man fall asks the Captain. Billy Budd contradicts Claggart! There is a burial at sea. Budd is promoted to Captain of the fore-top. Claggart objects. Kincaid will be punished for shouting out. Ten lashes. Budd talks to Claggart. Only the strong survive says Claggart. What do you know of loneliness? There is a plan to put Budd on report for improper storage of his gear. Budd is warned about Claggarts schemes. Can a false witness do it? Budd and Kincaid struggle. Claggart finds them. More sail is raised the next morning. Claggart tells the Captain Budd is plotting mutiny! Budd stammers, then strikes Claggart, who falls down. Justice must be done now.

The court martial begins. The Captain testifies. Budd tells what happened. The Dansker tells what he know. Captain Vere reminds them of the military code. They must have guilty verdict. The opposite viewpoints are discussed. The military code must supercede justice. It is the law, not justice that must prevail. Budd is condemned. The Captain begins the ceremony. No talking in the ranks! There is dissension in the ranks, but it is quelled. God Bless Captain Vere. The crew is dismissed, but they stand. A French ship fires on them, the crew responds as trained.

I never read the novel by Herman Melville. It was adapted to a stage play, and then this movie. It seems to be a psychological story about personality conflicts. Ever know a manager like Claggart? Could he exist outside of the military? This story does not seem to have popular appeal. The philosophical argument of following the law or doing justice is always topical. What do you think should have been done in this case? Since the law is the rules to produce justice, justice is more important. The important lesson here is that when two employees squabble management may get rid of both (no matter the justice). If of unequal status you know who will win. The ending where the crew unites against an outside threat shows how public opinion may be manipulated by reports of threats from an enemy.",1425600000,,2916,4.700587084148728

1200636,5,B00000F2GH,"This was another of Herman Melville's masterworks(along with Moby Dick) and not only chronologued the spirit of the times on the high seas but also the timeless struggle between freedom and authority.
In the film, Billy(Clarence Stamp) is a hand on a commerce ship under sail which is stopped by a British warship.  As was the custom of the RN(Royal Navy), they impressed(drafted) men off of other nation's vessels. Billy is thrown into the grueling inhospitable world of the impressed seaman, whereupon he's put under the tyrannic rule of the master at arms(Robert Ryan), who's charged with keeping the unruly gang in order.  The elite officers(Peter Ustinov as captain, David McCallum as a junior officer) stand apart and consider the crew as rabble. The inner turmoil, fights, conspiracies, and final confrontation(Billy vs. the master at arms) forces us to consider mercy, justice, rights, law and the nature of Man.  This is Peter Ustinov's film and he creates a simple war film which somehow challenges our thoughts and elicits emotional connection to the characters.
This is a must have for anyone interested in the period of sail, the Royal Navy, or anyone searching for a thoughtful movie not designed for the Saturday matinee crowd.",1421625600,,1242,5.108374384236453

It has that typical commercial appeal of protagonist, mentor, antagonist, etc., but what makes this so unique is how well rounded the characters are. Of course, this is Melville's doing, but knowing how so many books get made into bad movies, it's remarkable, especially by the standards of that day, that this was as successful as it was. The back-and-forth soul searching of the captain and his (and everyone's) nemesis is complicated, real, and sometime even painful to watch. Even Billy Budd, who seems unshakable, if finally brought down by injustices that he has never been able to imagine. It's just incredible from start to finish.

1200692,5,B00000F2GH,"With a masterful screenplay adaptation and beautiful direction by Peter Ustinov, Herman Melville's last novel, published after his death, became Terence Stamp's astonishing acting debut.

In fact, Ustinov also produced and plays the part of kindly Captain Vere.

On the surface, this powerful moral story questions the strict military code when it brushes up against a plea for human compassion.  But is it really about the balance of law with justice?  Can there even be justice without mercy?

The year is 1797.  Billy Budd (Terence Stamp) is a young sailor on a merchant ship with the name ""Rights of Man"" emblazoned on its hull.  He is drafted onto the HMS Avenger, a British fighting ship on the track of the French navy.  Young Billy is an innocent.  His fellows respond to his nave charm and gentle kindness.  That is, everyone but John Claggert, Master d'Arms (Robert Ryan).  Claggert is a sadist who delights in harsh punishment for even minor offenses.  Though he despises Billy, he too is drawn to Billy.  Claggert hates this weakness of his soul.  He suppresses these last glimmers of human feeling and takes his fury and hatred out on Billy, aiming to destroy him.

Billy is a kind of classic Christ story.  Evil is very real as it manifests itself in Claggert.  Ustinov's Captain Vere is the mirror image of Claggert.

Stamp is remarkable as young Billy.  His minimalist, understated performance earned him an Academy Award nomination.

But it is Ustinov's vision and control over this production that makes it what it is: an extraordinary meditation on good, evil and the human condition.  See this little-known, timeless, film and understand why Ustinov is an artist and a genius.  On the commentary track, Stamp talks about his memories of making his film debut and his subsequent, sudden fame and career in a lively conversation with Steven Soderbergh.  From Warner Home Video.

1200693,5,B00000F2GH,"Peter Ustinov does a superb job in his writing, directing, acting, and producing this classic sea drama which deals with the issue of law versus justice on a ship whose men are pitted against one another because of the underhanded cruelty and the unscrupulous actions of the crew captain, played by Robert Ryan.

I would rate BILLY BUDD equal to the 1935 production of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, starring Clark Gable and Charles Laughton.  Yet, BILL BUDD delves deeper into the tension between a sea captain's obligation to effect law on the high seas, and his human and moral responsibility to ensure that 'justice' is aptly served to restore order, and instill a collective harmony and trust among his men when problems erupt on board.

Terrance Stamp is especially poignant in his debut performance as the amiable, innocent young seaman, Billy Budd.

1200696,5,B00000F2GH,"Billy Budd (Terence Stamp) is a young sailor who is drafted from a merchant vessel onto a British fighting ship (HMS Avenger) in pursuit of the French navy in 1797.  His new colleagues take an instant shine to young Billy, who is extremely naive and kind.  He has a way about him that charms everyone on board - everyone, that is, except for the Master d'Arms, John Claggart (Robert Ryan).  Claggart is an evil man, fond of harshly punishing his men for minor or imagined offenses.  Despite his animosity toward Billy, Claggart finds himself slowly being drawn in by the young man, which infuriates him all the more.  He sets about trying to destroy Billy.

Peter Ustinov, who plays the patient and understanding Captain Vere, also co-wrote, directed, and produced ""Billy Budd,"" which is based on the posthumous novel by Herman Melville.  The story is a classic battle between good and evil, and Ustinov handles every aspect of the story with subtlety and sensitivity.  Key to the movie is the astounding debut performance by Stamp.  In lesser hands, Billy could end up as a simpleton or too angelic (or a charming flirt).  Stamp manages to create a three-dimensional character - one who chooses to focus on the good in people and situations; Billy's actions are wholly believable because of the fine balance that Stamp finds between the character's many qualities.

I'd say that Stamp's performance, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, is as good as any I've seen in a 1960s movie.  A number of the best films of the 1960s were released in 1962, including ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Lolita,"" ""The Music Man,"" ""Through a Glass, Darkly,"" ""The Exterminating Angel,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""The Miracle Worker,"" ""Freud,"" and ""A Knife in the Water.""  ""Billy Budd"" stands up well among these classic films and should be far better known than it is.

The DVD features an enlightening commentary with Terence Stamp and indie director Steven Soderburgh; it's really more of an interview than a commentary, but it's fun hearing Stamp's reminisce about the film.",1261872000,3,2133,4.971830985915493
1200697,5,B00000F2GH,"""Billy Budd"", from Herman Melville's story, is directed by Peter Ustinov, and set at sea in 1797. Ustinov plays Captain Vere of the war-time British navy vessel on which the story unfolds. The angelic, pure hearted young Billy Budd (Terence Stamp in his first film role), is a psychological threat to the cruel Claggart(Robert Ryan), whom life has turned into a man who must destroy any sign of goodness. He no longer believes in it. He is filled with darkness and hatred. A situation develops which becomes a battle of Good versus Evil and a demonstration of a conflict between Justice and Law.
Ustinov, as the Captain must enforce the rules of the Navy - being ruled by his head, rather than his heart. His duty torments him to breaking point. This classic tale is an unforgettable experience, in gorgeous black and white Cinemascope. Black and white very well suits this film about polar opposites.

As for the story, a nice, innocent kid getting brutalized by an incredibly-sadistic 1700s ship officer is not always easy to watch, but this is one of the better under-publicized films of its day. It sill holds up, some 40-plus years later.

It was an apt choice to cast Robert Ryan as the sadistic ""Claggart."" Ryan played mostly villains in his career and is extremely effective in that role here as an intelligent-but-sick-and-vicious bully. In fact, his character in Billy Budd remains one of the most memorable villains I've seen in a half century of movie watching. It isn't just his deeds. The looks on his face alone as he delivers his lines make him fascinating.

Peter Ustinov gives a great performance as the captain of the ship and a man who has to make a big, big decision about Mr. Budd, played by a young and boyish-looking Terrence Stamp. The character ""Billy Budd"" is about as pure and innocent as some of the characters Jennifer Jones played in the 1940s, such as Cluny Brown, Bernadette Soubirous or Jennie Appleton. Also of interest is Melvyn Douglas as the aging seaman.

1200722,5,B00000F2GH,"""Billy Budd"" is a superior film almost any way you want to look at it.  It could be a literal tale of a good boy versus an evil man and an evil system; it could be a Christian allegory of a Christ figure running up against personalized evil--Satan, if you will.
But I don't want to over-intellectualize it...""Billy Budd"" is also an entertaining film--one well worth the time invested watching it.
If you have a really sharp high-school age Youth Group at your church or synagogue, this film would make perfect watching for the group, with a lively discussion to follow.
On a completely different level, watch for a young David MacCallum as one of the Naval officers, just two years before he created a sensation on TV's ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.""

Please believe everything positive people say about this film and more.  There will simply never be a better cast assembled to film this Melville novella, and the handling and treatment are visionary and extraordinary....

...except the last 3 minutes -- so far afield of Melville's subtlety and lesson as to be incomprehensible.  Melville's story was somewhat enhanced for dramatic purposes up to this point, but all the choices were sound.  And then it was undone.

I am witholding saying more as not to give it away, just as a warning -- especially to those who know and love Melville.  His ending could have been very simply done, and the meanings inherent here would have blossomed to cosmic proportion.  As they do in Melville's final pages.  This ends up something much more limited.  But you still have perhaps the greatest performances of all the actors involved, in any movie I have ever seen any of them in.  For the wreck of this movie does not touch what they do, nor in any way involve them (2 of the 3 major players are already offstage by then, and the 3rd does not get new lines, but is deprived of Melville's final lines for him, and proper context).

1200724,4,B00000F2GH,"The immensely talented Peter Ustinov displays his versatility not only producing, directing and acting in the notable film ""Billy Budd"" but also wrote the screenplay based on the Herman Melville short story.

The setting is primarily aboard the H.M.S. Avenger in 1797 during one of the many wars between England and France.  Young Billy Budd played by a youthful Terence Stamp is impressed into the British Navy from an English merchant ship.  The pleasant easy going Budd immediately gains favor with the crew and the Avenger's captain the moral and dutiful Captain Vere played by Ustinov.  Despite his positive nature Budd runs afoul of cruel and sadistic Master of Arms, the blackhearted John Claggart, played superbly by star of the film Robert Ryan.  Veteran actor Melvyn Douglas playing voice of reason sailmaker Dansker represents the conscience of the crew as they respond to the power play aboard the ship.

The film expertly emphasizes the clash between good and evil as Ryan and Stamp interract with Billy Budd innocently trying to win over Claggart.  The climax is reached as Ryan accuses Stamp of mutiny before the captain.  Stamp unable to defend himself due to a stammering problem lashes out and kills Ryan with a blow to the head.

Ustinov now must uneviably decide the fate of the popular but unfortunate Budd as he is shackled by the military law he has sworn to abide by.",1191974400,6,1391,4.910256410256411

Ustinov appears as Captain Vere, along with a superb collection of English actors...and Melvyn Douglas, who was on holiday and talked into appearing as Danska. This comes out amusingly in DVD extra.

Wow!!!...everyone is one the same page and as if all this was not enough you get a wonderful voice over chat with Mr. Stamp and director / film buff Steven Soderbergh...which is fantastic!

1200782,4,B00000F2GH,"Peter Ustinov directed this unambitious work and made a great film. Beautifully shot in black & white, the story is based on a play after Melville's famous story. Billy Budd has to leave the merchant ship ""The Rights of Man"" to embark on the British man-of-war ""Avenger"". He is all innocent and cheerful, he represents goodness itself. His good nature will charm all on board, but will he charm evil in person: the master-of-arms played perfectly by Robert Ryan? There's a philosophical undertone during all the film, a debate between good and evil, and between choosing to do what the law says and what one feels to be the right thing (that is, justice). At times this slows down the pace of the film as it becomes too obvious, to the detriment of the plot itself, which becomes too static.

I am glad this film was shot in black and white, as it suits the theme perfectly: evil vs goodness; man's laws vs the natural law of God. There are a few moments that are really intense and beautiful. For instance when Billy Bud (Terence Stamp) tries to have a conversation with evil Robert Ryan, the master-at-arms. Robert Ryan is astounded at this young man's simplicity and inability to hate: ""-Is it ignorance or irony that makes you speak so simply? -Must be ignorance, sir. 'Cause I don't understand the other word.""

It's not the kind of film you would expect seeing the colorful poster: it has hardly any action. But it's a very good film. A little gem I hadn't seen until now. I bought it as part of the ""Literary Classic Collection"" package, and I didn't expect it to be such a good film. Worth buying the whole package.",1176681600,2,1623,4.573883161512027
1200783,5,B00000F2GH,"There are a number of classic historical novels that transfer well to movies without actually losing the story. Herman Melville's ""Billy Budd, Foretopman"" is one such classic.

In addition to being an outstanding story with great, solid characters, this is based on the actual events that occurred within the British Navy during its war with France. The major mutiny at the English port of Spithead, had word reached the sailing fleet, would have undermined Britain's stand against Napoleon and a potential French invasion.

Billy Budd, a simple lad and merchant seaman, is pressed into service in the Royal Navy on the high seas, a common practice of the time. Out of the entire merchant crew, he is the only one who says he will keep his knowledge of the Spithead mutiny to himself - a mutiny that eventually brought major changes to the treatment of British sailors.

The backstory, as are so many, is one of good vs. evil. However, without hitting the reader or viewer over the head with unrelenting morality, the story itself, the acting by classic actors and the direction by Peter Ustinov, who also stars as Captain Vere, work together to bring that essence to the fore.

The entire story takes place on a British Man-o-War in 1797. In addition to Peter Ustinov, Terence Stamp makes his major film role debut. Other stars include Robert Ryan, Melvin Douglas and a very young David McCallum (Dr. ""Ducky"" Mallard on TV's NCIS). There are also many other well known actors in supporting roles.

I pre-ordered it before March 6th & it arrived today. I am ecstatic. In fact, I have a confession to make; I invited all the reviewers on this page to be my friend, just so I could message them & let them know about this new release. I have also uploaded a pict of the cover from the DVD to help distinguish it from that other awful copied version.

MOVIE - 5 STARS, DVD - 5 STARS.

Like many, I saw this movie when I was young and it made a great impression on me- I have never forgotten it. I was in 10th grade in literature class and that was about 24 years ago (holy smokes!) This movie, adapted from the Herman Melville story is about many things- its complexity and nuances are something wonderful to behold. I have read the story and seen the movie & I must say, I prefer Ustinov's adaptation to the book. I think Ustinov did a more than masterful job of acting, directing, producing and writing. Not many people can wear 4 ""hats"" so very well. I personally have always felt this was his opus magnum- and I've heard it was a personal favorite of his. To me he captures so much of the struggle of what it is to be human in every frame of this movie. From the every day struggles of dignity to the struggle between the law and justice.

The acting by all is wonderful. Terrance Stamp's screen debut is perfect. His understated way is just what Billy needed. Robert Ryan is the perfect villain- why? Because he is HUMAN- like us all, he struggles with his own demons- his are just closer to the surface than most. In that unforgettable scene on the deck at night with Billy, it is almost as heart-wrenching as the final scene where injustice makes its ugly presence known. In the deck scene with Claggart you can see the armor of his slowly drop, there's just a hint of a tear in his left eye-  and then, in a flash, his armor of evil is back in full force. Ryan's performance is just awesome to behold! How lucky are we all to have this entire movie on DVD to enjoy for years to come!
All of the supporting roles are well done- all believable. The on location shots in Spain on the open seas are fabulous! It adds a huge sense of reality to the whole movie. Lighting and the music is just beautiful too.

The extra features... yes, I'm such a fanatic, the minute I checked the mail I put the DVD in & listened to the commentary by Stamp & Soderbergh. If you are looking to find out a lot about the movie, you may be disappointed- if you wanted to find out a lot about Terrance Stamp, you'll be happy. He speaks at length about his own career and some things unrelated to the movie. There is not a lot of scene by scene commentary. He does speak about Ustinov and some of the things about production. His discourse is erudite and even occasionally stimulating. Soderbergh is in the role of an interviewer in this case. I enjoyed the commentary, but one does wonder how much it would've been enriched if someone had gotten off their dead butts & done this before Ustinov died. (I mourn him openly- he was my renaissance man- funny, smart and a humanitarian.)

All and all, I'm quite pleased to have this DVD. I'm thankful to Warner Bros. for putting it out on DVD with a quality picture and sound.

Lines such as "" The Law will exist as long as man has a mind, and Justice as long as he has a heart"" and ""Goodbye old Rights of Man"" stay with me to this day. Ustinov did such a brilliant job in capturing the heart of the novelette by Melville. The portrayals of each character were excellent, as was the tension between Budd and Claggart, not just black and white caricatures, but expressions of the complexity and complicity of the human heart. Terrence Stamp is totally believable in a role that would be very hard to portray, Robert Ryan as Claggart is so totally humanly corrupt and bitter that you feel pity for him even as you despise him, Ustinov as Captain Vere is palpably torn in his head versus heart conflict. Keep an eye out for a very young John Meillon (Wally in Crocodile Dundee fame for those outside Oz) and David McAllum pre ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" fame.

Based on the other reviews here on Amazon, I will wait for a true studio version in widescreen to be released.  I share all the other comments in that it is an absolute insult to a milestone of cinematic history not to have this gem properly available to the public.  The use of this film in education, in reminding our own government and to the wisdom of people in general is beyond that of nearly any other film I can think of.  I can only hope that someone who cares deeply about the legacy of such masterpieces, and who has the resources, can pick up the DVD rights and produce a product worthy of it's content.  (Ted Turner / Turner Classic Movies perhaps?  Possibly one of the academic institutions committed to cinematic history can get involved, or maybe even Bill Gates and his interest in digitally documenting history...)

It's also been cut by about 3 minutes (presumably to fit just under 2 hours--though the disc could hold more, having been burned at ""LP"" quality, not ""SP""). Billy Budd is such a perfectly made film, that any cuts are detrimental and very noticeable. It's also squeezed into the 4:3 format (it was originally filmed in widescreen Cinemascope), and no one, of course, bothered to clean up the film. The whole DVD is a mess and not worth the 20+ dollars it's going for. Unfortunately, it's the only version available--which is a crime! Whoever has the rights to this masterpiece, please do a decent job on it and release it!",1157587200,9,1128,4.760204081632653
1200830,2,B00000F2GH,"This is a fine movie, but greatly overpriced for a final product on DVD.  To be honest, when I looked at the playing side of the disc, I thought I had purchased a bootleg, a pirated copy of the original DVD release.  Judging from the comments of other purchasers, however, I see that that isn't the case.  If you must have this DVD, I recommend purchasing it from one of the dealers on Amazon who will sell it to you for less.  Considering the poor picture quality and lack of extras, the disc is really worth around $10 or less, as far as I'm concerned.",1156377600,4,554,4.247619047619048

1200832,5,B00000F2GH,"This is more of a review of the DVD than the movie.  As indicated in other reviews, the movie is wonderful and I rate it five stars.

The DVD is as basic as it could be.  There are no special features or included material other than the DVD.  The movie looks like it was copied off of an old film real with various streaks and imperfections.  I don't know if the original movie was wide screen, but the DVD is formatted to fit a square TV.

It was a long wait to see this on DVD and it is a shame that more wasn't put into the DVD.  Having said that, it was a joy to watch this movie.  God bless Captain Vere.",1154908800,6,609,3.894308943089431

I'm sure a multitude of movie goers are waiting for the DVD version, which is LONG OVERDUE as older movies have been released already.  It is unbelieveable that whoever is responsible for holding this film from the public is doing a disservice to the cast and crew of this quality movie.

5 Stars for an excellent film with incredible performances.

0 Stars for the fools that released this timeless classic on an obsolete video format.

When will a DVD be released? It's pretty sad that Ed Wood has a DVD boxed set, but this awesome Peter Ustinov film is still languishing on VHS.",1143331200,10,335,4.6440677966101696
1200835,5,B00000F2GH,"A very fine adaptation of Herman Melville's story of morality and the law aboard an English man-of-war in 1797. Peter Ustinov is Captain Vere, who believes the code of his office is the only one to live by, which makes no room for human judgment or conscience. Terence Stamp is the naive, innocent, Christ-like Budd, who kills the sadistic master-at-arms Robert Ryan out of self-defense when his stammer prevents him from talking. Melvyn Douglas is the self-loathing Claggart. Everyone is superb, and the script is faithful to the original. There is much to ponder about here, and repeated viewings only add to the enjoyment and inner searching. Highly recommended.",1125619200,7,665,5.110091743119266

7906379,5,B00000F2GH,"Recently, I went back and re-read Melvilles original novel and then took time to view a couple of film versions of the classic novel. I wound up wanting to recommend two films, including this one largely shaped by the incredibly talented Peter Ustinov and co-starring both a young Terence Stamp and a battle-weary Robert Ryan. The other film I can recommend is Claire Deniss much more abstract rendering of the tale in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beau-Travail/dp/B00006JDTD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beau Travail</a>

First of all, potential viewers today may question whether to invest in a film shot in black and white, given that everything today is in color. Thats not an issue for fans of classic Hollywood films like Casablanca and even early black-and-white musicals like 42nd Street. Still, it may be something you're thinking about as you contemplate this DVD. I can tell you: I was surprised that a big-screen epic on the high seas was shot in black and white, but its really a non-issue as soon as this taught plot begins to unfold.

Second, this truly is one of the mature works of the great Peter Ustinov. If youve only seen him in moviesperhaps as Agatha Christies Hercule Poirot in a series of mysteriesthen you may not realize what an amazing artist he truly was before his death in 2004. He was an accomplished author, director and was responsible for a whole series of well-received theatrical productionsincluding operas. I mention all of this to say: He was the perfect choice to adapt Melvilles novel to a film form.

Just watch the closeups in a series of verbal sparring matches that occur throughout this film. Oh yes, theres action here including the firing of cannons, danger high in the rigging of the ship and all the other staples of classic sea-faring dramas. But the whole impact of this movie rests on the key moments of back and forth between the piercingly insightful, purely honest Billy and the dangerous moral corruption of Claggartas well as the ships top officers who must balance Billys fate against larger questions of law and justice.

Its a wonderful, memorable movie thanks largely to Ustinovs overall vision and Terence Stamps ability to play this strangely tragic, angelic title character.",1488153600,4,2283,5.178861788617886
