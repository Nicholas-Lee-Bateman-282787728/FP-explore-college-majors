4236061,5,B003ZVU1P0,I was there for night one thanks to HBO...the best of the 2 from what I saw..I still have the HBO special on DVR and was waiting for this to come out...now I can delete it and move on with my life.,1282780800,3,197,3.7142857142857144
4236062,5,B003ZVU1P0,"I was at these concerts too and saw the special on HBO and the performances are awesome.  Seeing  U2, Mick Jagger and Fergie do the Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" is worth the price of admission alone.  But you also get tons of other great performances:  Sting with Stevie Wonder; Jeff Beck with Buddy Guy and Billy Gibbons (the ZZ Top guy); Simon & Garfunkel doing all their biggest hits; Lou Reed and Ray Davies playing with Metallica;  John Fogerty and Billy Joel playing with Springsteen; etc. etc.  And it looks like there's a bunch of bonus songs that we didn't see on HBO.  I definitely recommend this.",1281916800,62,602,4.622641509433962
4236063,5,B003ZVU1P0,I was at the first night's concert and watched the HBO special--which was nothing short of amazing---but I was surprised that so many incredible performances were cut. I'm absolutely looking forward to seeing the extra 16 performances in this DVD set and owning a piece of Rock history....giving this 5 stars!,1281916800,3,309,5.078431372549019
4236064,5,B003ZVU1P0,"I was there for the first night. HBO's broadcast cut many magical moments, so this package is a must for most fans. Even though this isn't yet released, I can state the sound mix that night was first class! We couldn't believe how well produced, but not over produced the night was... 5 hours of pure magic.",1281052800,9,307,4.4035087719298245

4236106,2,B003ZVU1P0,"I bought it just for ""Gimme Shelter"". Fergie sings the ""rape, murder"" part better than I have ever heard anyone before. Ironically U2's The Edge does not play the guitar part to this song very well and then when I am enjoying his playing on ""Mysterious Ways"" they bring out the rappers. The sound on this blu-ray is so good that I can stand to watch and listen to some of the artist that I usually would not want to be bothered with, but I have zero tolerance for rap.",1450137600,,468,4.211111111111111

4236185,5,B003ZVU1P0,I went to this concert and will never forget it. The best concert of my life even though I had to buy tickets twice as someone sold me counterfeit tickets. Hard to believe huh? Even though this concert will for ever be burnt into my mind this DVD brings me back to that time. I try to find myself in the crowd as I was about 20 feet from Mick Jagger. Not sure If I will make it to the 50th Anniversay (I'll be 85)  but if I am I will go knowing what a great time this was. This was an excellent tape and a must see for all you rock and rollers.,1401062400,,544,3.7719298245614037

Each was well done and this will be a great videio to have in one's collection for the future. Simon and Garfunkel's performance along with Crosby, Still and Nash with their guests were my favorites.  The Boss is always the boss with his guests.

4236198,5,B003ZVU1P0,"Some great reunions such as :Simon and Garfunkle, Crosby, Stills and Nash plus others. Each featured artist also invited guests to play with them. So there are many combinations never seen before and never to heard again.

Personal favorites; U2 - Gimme Shelter, The Boss + U2, Simon and Garfunkle, some of the older rock pioneers. A special favorite is the closing song of Jackie Wilson's (your love keeps lifting me) Higher and Higher starting with Springsteen and adding so many other singers that it became difficult to see them all. The DVD has the complete version, which is rousing. HBO used a condensed version during closing credits.

If you like Rock and Roll and value its history, then you'll love this DVD,",1389916800,,719,4.837398373983739

4236206,5,B003ZVU1P0,"This concert dvd is loaded with first rate performances.  U2's Magnificent and their version of Gimme Shelter with Mick Jagger, Fergie and wil.i.am guesting are sensational.  Simon & Garfunkel's The Boxer will blow you away.  Paul Simon, Graham Nash and David Crosby's version of Here Comes the Sun is simply beautiful.  The harmonies sound like school boys instead of the older men you see singing at the mics.  There are so many more great numbers to like on this dvd.  It doesn't hurt that on blu-ray the video and audio are exceptional.",1380931200,,540,4.815217391304348

4236208,3,B003ZVU1P0,"CS&N, S&G, U2 and Jeff Beck were great.  The Gimme Shelter was clearly top shelf.  Most of the songs in these sets were excellent and I'll listen to them regularly.  The art of harmony is not lost.  It's a real pleasure to listen to Graham and David hit the notes and mix it up with other artists.  Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel gave a very inspiring performance.  The performance by Jeff Beck had the quality of a headliner, even though he was a backup, .

I swear that Bruce Springsteen was playing air guitar.  After watching many live performances of the real masters, I'd rather see an artist pick up a microphone or tambourine if the skills on an instrument are no longer there.  As a fan for years, it's sad to see how much Billy Joel has lost. I started skipping some songs in Aretha's set.

After listening to this several times, I'd still buy in a minute.  The remote would be in my lap as I picked my way through it.",1379894400,5,926,4.294797687861272

4236210,4,B003ZVU1P0,"but alas, as soon as Metallica took the stage and Hatfield straddled his bass and spoke, I felt the nausea starting....but, do not despair,  the use of good DVD editing software can cure the nausea, as I have done.

Best moment:  Springsteen + Morello singing The Ghost of Tom Joad... the child like enthusiasm on Tom's face as he glances over at Bruce, is momentous.....",1378425600,,371,4.676923076923077

4236212,5,B003ZVU1P0,"I first saw this on Netflix and when it was no longer available there I came here in search of it.
There are so many artists that I can't name them all but let me say there's something here for fans of just about every genre of rock.
From roots to metal to straight forward rock this covers the bases well.
Check out Bonnie Raitt & Jeff Beck & CSN & Metallica & Springsteen & Billy Joel & Paul Simon & John Fogerty and many more.
The best surprise for me was all the extras on the Blu-ray that weren't included on Netflix, including several more live performances.
I also have to say that to me it's obvious someone with live music mixing experience mixed the audio.
Let me 'splain...when someone who doesn't have that experience mixes a live music event, you can tell because whoever the camera is on at the moment is the LOUDEST in the mix. For this you hear a true live mix...even if the cam isn't on a certain person you hear whoever is taking lead at the time.
And my hubby who is an audio engineer/musician will probably smack me for saying that Tom Morello's guitar solo on Springsteen's ""Tom Joad"" brought him to tears.
If you're a rock fan...get this.
Small disclaimer: we watch this on a home theater system with 5.1 audio and upscaling Blu-ray player. Worth it!",1374364800,2,1272,4.3940677966101696

Live Aid is definitely an historic landmark that not only bears witness to the generosity of so many but also makes it evident that good music was not a stranger to a vast number of bands and musicians at the time, however big or small they were. Live Aid could not have been more successful. Perhaps because of the rawness and all the rough edges that gave it its charm and uniqueness, such an event will probably never be repeated.

Amazingly, the two best performances are Fergie with U2 on ""GimmeShelter"" and Tom Morello pairing with Bruce on ""Ghost of Tom Joad"".

4236265,2,B003ZVU1P0,"I think the concerts come across exactly like they were planned - let's feature whoever we can get and throw in some representatives of genres here and there.  But the main question the organizers appear to have forgotten to ask is, ""can they still sing well?""

Some can - James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Art Garfunkel, Stevie Wonder, Bono, Springsteen and Jagger, but many can't, and just shouldn't: Paul Simon, Stephen Stills (not at all in fact), Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin (what a shame), Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Joel.  For me, it isn't enough to cough up big bucks for a concert just for the joy of ""seeing"" a former star - I want to hear good music that in their prime they could give.

Instrumentally, everyone in the concert was still excellent, and I really enjoyed that part of it.  I guess that makes sense - the vocal chords will stretch and thin out due to age, but if you can still hear and move your arms/hands/fingers, you don't normally forget how to play.

Thematically I was confused - this was the 25th Anniversary of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which means what...?  The inductees to the Hall include Simon and Garfunkle, Neil Diamond, Metallica, the Bee Gees, Madonna...musicians covering genres like R&B, pop, hard rock, soft rock, pop, jazz.  But the concert was not an attempt to cover each genre (or at least if it was an attempt, it failed).  Obviously more genres meant more stars, more rehearsal studios, more logistics.  But I think more singers with fewer songs each would have been the awesome event originally conceived.  In other words, set up the venue and goal and stick to it - if it doesn't pan out, dump it.  The concert notes say that Aretha Franklin was a royal pain, but yet they headline her with 4+ numbers (and she just doesn't have it any more). Aretha Franklin was big in her time, but that's really pushing the envelope for baby boomers out there - people in their mid-50's and later might have really enjoyed that part, but I sure didn't.

These discs contain some awesome performances (Simon and Garfunkle when Simon's singing harmony only; Stevie Wonder; Jackson Browne; Springsteen), so they may still be worth the price, you'll just find yourself skipping a lot of material.",1340582400,5,2232,4.6923076923076925

4236271,5,B003ZVU1P0,"There are not enough superlatives for this DVD set and the concerts.

First, to address the issue of DVD problems that I have seen in some older reviews ......
There were NONE. The DVD set played perfectly with great audio and video throughout.
Would we ever expect less from Amazon.....

The 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Concerts are quite possibly the best we have ever seen.  Whether your rock is of the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's or this millennium, you should absolutely not miss this concert.

Come join a sold out NYC Madison Square Garden crowd for two nights of a multi-decade anthology of great rock and roll.
The list of artists is itself impressive. And they do perform their own classics throughout the concerts.
But what makes this a once-in-a-lifetime event is the way various artists crank out their music TOGETHER

Consider these examples ........

Crosby, Stills & Nash WITH Bonnie Raitt or Jackson Browne or James Taylor
Stevie Wonder WITH Smokey Robinson or John Legend or B.B. King or Sting or Jeff Beck
Simon and Garfunkel WITH Crosby & Nash or Dion
Aretha WITH Annie Lennox
Metallica WITH Lou Reed or Ozzy or Ray Davies or doing Seger (bonus disc.)
U2/Bono WITH Bruce Springsteen AND Patti Smith cranking out Because The Night and WITH Fergie AND Jagger nailing Gimme Shelter
Bruce and the full E Street Band WITH Sam Moore or John Fogerty or Darlene Love or Billy Joel
..... the list goes on and on .......

The original concerts were on HBO. We first saw them on Palladia and knew right away we had to have the DVDs.
The first 2 discs contain over 3 hours of the concerts with some performances not seen on HBO/Palladia.
The third disc is all bonus performances not shown on HBO

So grab your rockin' squeeze and favorite vino; crank up the volume and/or put on some headphones and
ROCK ON....................
Expect some chills ......",1327017600,,1871,4.700305810397554

4236279,5,B003ZVU1P0,"I'm more of a rock & roll guy than blues, so disc 2 in itself was worth the price for me. Some of the collaborations here are just outstanding.
Personally I thought U2's set was the best, with 'Gimme Shelter' taking the cake. Mick Jagger's still got it (he brings the house down, no question). Was it just me or did Ferige actually take that song to another level (I know!)?
Tom Morello was superb (again!). I was also very happy to see 2 of my favorites - John Fogerty (Creedence) and Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top) - on stage.
Another personal favorite was Jeff Beck's instrumental cover of the Beatles' ""A Day in the Life"" - It was perfect!

There's really no downside to purchasing this. Most of the artists here are on the wrong side of 50 (or 60), so this might really be the best chance of seeing them rock on stage, let alone together.

I was born in 1968 so knew of the older greats and all their music, thought I didn't catch most of them until I got more into music in the 80s.  But serious music lovers of any age will be completely taken by this concert.  If you love music, you'll love it.  I mean seriously.  If you had told me this concert could happen, I would have thought it was some kind of dream I had.  Metallica starting, then Lou Reed jumping in, then Ozzy.... and I could go on and on and on, that's just the first 10 minutes.  COMPLETELY worth it.  And I don't even really like recorded concerts.

The picture quality looks quite good, and for those that are lucky enough to have one with complete sound, I'm sure it is a good product.  You would think Time Life Entertainment would produce a quality product and have quality assurance and control procedures in place to keep defective discs from being distributed.

4236301,5,B003ZVU1P0,"25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Concert 10/29/09 MSG

In 1964 someone threw on a Beatles album one day in Kindergarten. I was hooked immediately. Thence began a lifelong obsession with Rock and Roll, and music in general. In the years that followed many others artists were introduced to me first by my brother Ira, then followed by AM/FM Radio, TV, and host of friends and acquaintances. Today, the internet thru Pandora.com has turned me on to great new music that is being created daily.
Many months ago, I heard The Today Show mention that The Rock Hall Of Fame was having a 25th Anniversary Concert benefit in New York City at Madison Square Garden. The list of artists were stunning. I knew I had to see this show. I dutifully went online exactly at 9:00 am and purchased two seats for the show. Nosebleeds with a decent center view. Section 303, row B.
Arriving an hour before the show, I was interviewed by HBO about my feelings towards the event. They liked my soundbyte about seeing so many of the artists on my ""bucket list"" all at once. If you ever see it during a promo, let me know!
I took some mental notes on the show, and will try to recall them as best as possible.
A 20 minute video starts the show with montage of Rock hall artists and moments from the history of the Rock Hall Of Fame. Naming the artists was a challenge. Got about 80% of them. Cameron Crowe did a great job putting this together. It's impact was nostalgic and emotional. Video played a big part between sets and to introduce the artists.
Tom Hanks came out to give a rousing speech about the emotional impact and importance of Rock and Roll to our American psyche and experience. As Tom is finishing, I see an older man being escorted to a Piano. This would be the first unannounced guest.
Tom introduces Jerry Lee Lewis who proceeds to pound out ""Whole Lotta Shakin Going On""
Next, Crosby,Stills, and Nash take the stage and open with Joni Mitchell's classic ""Woodstock"". It was great to see them together, but Stephen Stills voice was flat. Though, his guitar playing is still very good.
Graham Nash sings ""Marakesh Express"". His voice is still intact and sweet. Surprised and very happy by the song choice thinking it was bit obscure to be selected. I have always loved this great song about discovery during a rail trip in Morocco during the 60's/early 70's. It tells a great story, and was great to see live.
Another surprise was David Crosby singing ""Almost Cut My Hair"". A rebellious song about not selling out. Crosby's voice was quite strong, and familiar.
Bonnie Raitt joins the CSN to loud applause. She is introduced as one of the greatest female voices in Rock and Roll. I agree. Her version of ""Love Has No Pride"" was soulful and sweet.
Nash and Crosby provided great background vocals in this song.
CSN with Bonnie Raitt then launched into Greg Allman's solo classic""Midnight Rider. Hoping Greg might appear, but no. Another odd song choice, but a welcome one.
Jackson Browne is then announced as one of the greatest Rock Artists of all time. He leads CSN in rousing version of ""The Pretender"". His voice sweet and clear undeniably Jackson Browne.
James Taylor takes the stage and his 70's classic ""Mexico"" is performed with CSN and company. Nice back up vocals by the boys.
Stephen Stills sings ""Love The One Your With"". James Taylor accompanies on a acoustic guitar, and sings back up vocals along with Nash & Crosby.
CSN performs their Buffalo Springfield classic ""Rock and Roll Woman"". Nice vocals and guitars. Stephen Stills voice improved drastically from the 1st song
The finale of the 1st set is ""Teach Your Children"". Jackson, Bonnie, and James join CSN in a fabulous send off. Wow, this is only just the 1st set!
Paul Simon opens the 1st set quietly by himself with ""Diamonds On The Soles Of His Shoes"". The band eventually joins him in a rocking finish. There are lot of people on the stage performing with Paul.
Paul performs his classic Queens centric song ""Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard"". Mucho fun! Love how Paul whistles the solo during that song.
""You Can Call Me Al"" is next. No Chevy Chase though. Remember, their duo from Saturday Night Live?
Paul brings out Dion Dimucci from Bronx's own Dion and The Belmonts. He leads Paul in a rousing version of ""The Wanderer"". Remember, the great movie that featured it in it's soundtrack. The alto sax is figures prominently in this song. A big picture of Dion And The Belmonts in the day is overhead.. Dion calls out to audience ""Yo"" ""Yo"" a bunch of times.
Paul Simon dedicates the next song to the founder of big rock benefit concerts George Harrison. In this very venue George in 1971 raised money during The Concert Of Bangladesh. With Graham Nash and David Crosby on back up vocals, Paul sings ""Here Comes The Sun"". Simply beautiful!
With a full horn section Paul rocks out ""Late In The Evening"". Dance able!
Paul invites Doo Wop pioneers Little Anthony and the Imperials to croon ""Two People in The World"". Sweet voices and harmonies.
Art Garfunkel takes the stage to ""The Sounds of Silence"". The audience is pretty stoked. Some nearby woman are crying. ""Mrs. Robinson"" into Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away"" back into ""Mrs. Robinson"" . Joe Dimaggio lyrics elicit applause. Meanwhile the Yankees are losing 1-0 in the World Series as the song is being performed.
The first notes of ""The Boxer"" begin. Amazing! What great songwriters, and performers these two are! Harmony's are us. Beautiful. Art Garfunkels voice is an American treasure.
""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" with it's signature piano quietly woos the audience. The garden is euphoric. Truly remarkable performance.
""Cecilia"" concludes a blow me away set. Still the second half of the show to look forward too!
Stevie Wonder takes the stage to terrible technical problems. The mic's are not working. He sits by the keyboard wagging his head back and forth waiting. Finally, he opens with Dylan's ""Blowing In The Wind""
Next, a medley of great hits. ""Everything is Alright"", ""I was Made To Love Her"", ""For Once In My Life"", ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"", ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"" (play harmonica). Stevie's voice is great, and performances very solid.
Smokey Robinson comes out and sings a soulful ""Tracks of My Tears"". An 60's picture of Smokey and The Miracles is projected overhead.
John Legend takes the stage. Sings a tribute to Marvin Gaye ""Mercy, Mercy, Me"". Marvin's picture is projected over the stage. He does Marvin justice!
Stevie sings and John plays dueling keyboards honoring the King Of Pop Michael Jackson with ""The Way She Makes Feel"". Stevie breaks down in the middle and cries. Eventually, he finishes the song. Stevie croons Walk With Michael Jackson, Jimmy Hendrix, and Bob Marley.
BB King joins Stevie and performs ""Thrill is Gone"" with Lucille, his guitar. Voice is great, and guitar tone and playing are wonderful.
Stevie sings ""Living For The City"" to a very enthusiastic crowd.
Sting performs ""Higher Ground"" on the bass with Stevie. Underrated bass player he is! Nice.
Sting Launches into a fast rocking version of ""Roxanne"". Missed the Police reunion, but saw this. Great performance. Stevie launches back into ""Higher Ground"".
Jeff Beck joins Stevie for ""Superstition"". His classic rock guitar styling was an awesome fit to this funky song! Jeff looks 40! Awesome!
The crowd goes wild to the announcement of the Yankees 3-1 victory over the Phillies!
Bruce hit's the stage with 10th Avenue Freezeout. I move really close to the stage in the $1,000 seats for the rest of the show.
Bruce performs ""Hold On, I'm Coming"", and ""Soul Man"" with Sam Moore from Sam and Dave. Bruce tells the audience that he learned how to lead a band from Sam during the 60's when he used to see him perform at the Saturday Night lounge in Fort Dix, New Jersey.
Tom Morello guitarist from Rage Against The Machines joins Bruce with a beat up guitar with long stringy guitar strings coming out of the top. They perform ""Ghost Of Tom Joad"". Wow! Never seen anyone play like that. Mad crazy skills! A virtuoso. Simply in Awe!
John Fogerty joins Bruce on stage. They rock out to ""Fortunate Son"". Great! Song still resonates and is relevant today. The two have excellent synergy.
Next ""Proud Mary"" with Clarence Clemens doing the Ike Turner baritone ""Rolling"". The crowd is loving it!
Bruce honors who he considers one of the greatest voices in Rock and Roll, and pioneer of rock song structure Roy Orbison. Saying he would dare not do this song alone, John and Bruce sing ""Pretty Woman"". Mercy!!!!! Fun. Nils playing an acoustic guitar giving that song it's classic twangy sound.
The piano begins that familiar solo leading into ""Jungleland"". Bruce runs around the stage as Clarence bangs out the sax. Great!
Darlene Love joins Bruce for a song or two.
Bruce announces he will do a song from one the best bands ever to come out of England. He smashes and slashes a punky version of ""London Calling"". I'm in heaven, Not seen that song live since 1983! Little Steven sings part of the song. Cool!
Tom Morello comes back out and plays guitar on ""Badlands"". I can tell you now, no one has ever strummed that song like that ever. Very cool!
Bruce announces that New Jersey and Long Island were once one before continental drift. That maybe that's why the populations are so similar. He says their will a reunion, a summit at the Garden. A bridge and tunnel meeting summit. Out comes Billy Joel or as Bruce says the King Of Long Island.
Billy sings ""Only The Good Die Young"". Bruce sings  the lyrics. They embrace after the song.
Billy plays the piano, and the timely ""New York State Of Mind"" is on its way. Bruce again sings  the lyrics. Wonderful. Can't believe so many people had left and missed this, and that we we are so close now!
Bruce launches into ""Born To Run"" with Billy playing the piano. So cool! The crowd is loving it. I know the end is near. It's 1:30 AM.
Finally, everyone joins together for ""Higher and Higher"". A fitting end to a magical evening!",1309046400,3,10001,4.707191780821918

Furthermore, other than predicted by Amazon, tax (Einfuhrumsatzsteuer) was to be paid. An extra fee (0,5 Euro) per day accrue for keeping the box at the customs office.

This concert makes Woodstock look like the people who don't make it on American Idol.  Simon and Garfunkel were a let down after Stevie and BB jamming, but overall it is GREAT!  I own the Crossroads DVDs too - Eric Clapton was supposed to be at this concert but he has having his gallbladder removed.  So Jeff Beck stepped in - since Jeff doesn't sing he had others step in and sing the songs he played including Mr. ZZ Top himself Billy Gibbons!

As others have said RUN to buy this bad boy, particularly if you're over 50!  BB is 85, Bonnie is 61, Paul Simon looked like he could have a stroke at any moment (LOL!)...this DVD will keep their awesome talents on display for you years after they're gone and fondly remembered.",1297468800,,1078,4.355

Others reviewers have already stated some of the highlights. The Bruce Springsteen/ Tom Morello Ghost of Tom Joad. Morello gives one of the best guitar solos I have ever witnessed. Really all the the Springsteen set. Then there's Fergie and Mick Jagger. Sting and Jeff Beck also make a good impression.
I am not a metal fan, but the Metallica set cooked.
If you want to nitpick, you could complain that most of the artists hail from the baby boom generation, getting long in the tooth. Almost all who make it into the hall of fame are going to be in their 50's and 60's, and these artists are featured on this production. They could have balanced out the concert with a few more young artists.

Highlights for me:

Metallica and Ozzy

U2 and everyone. Boss and Patty Smith give best version of Because the Night, Mick and Fergie duel on Gimmie Shelter.

Springsteen was the reason I watched in the first place, and there is no question why he is the last act. The range of this guy's music is unbelievable. He comes out and plays a couple songs with U2 just to tease into his set. Every song is good, but Tom Morello and Bruce going back and forth on Ghost of Tom Joad is my favorite song on the whole DVD. Billy Joel provides the perfect finale, performing New York City Serenade and following up with Born to Run. E Street Band is the greatest and most cohesive band that has ever existed, they flow effortlessly from one song to the next. Bruce calls out all his guests to perform a rendition of Jackie Wilson's Higher and Higher and at the end exclaims ""That's rock and roll!"" Epic.

4236358,5,B003ZVU1P0,"I find no need to write once again about how great the performances are on this set.
However, there are a few things that do bother me about it:

1. Like many people said, it would have made much more sense to give us the concerts as they happened, instead of sticking ""bonus"" tracks to a seperate disc.

2. There's no credit given to the brilliant sidemen who play with all of these guys. I think players like Vinnie Colaiuta and Tal Wilkenfeld from Jeff Beck's band deserve to have their name written next to the big guys.

3. The booklet that's included with is, well, a bit disappointing. Apart from the technical details (who wrote each song and which company handles the royalties), all you get is a reprint of a Rolling Stone article from last year. Sure, it's a nice read, but it makes me feel like someone cut a few corners. I was expecting something special.

4. The introduction at the beginning contains short snippets of footage taken at rehearsals. It's a shame they didn't include more of it, especially considering how the interviews in the above article repeatedly talk about what a great time they had in rehearsal.

Besides that, it's wonderful. It's still worth 5 stars, and if you're a fan of good music, get it!",1288137600,9,1233,4.5610859728506785

4236364,5,B003ZVU1P0,"I echo those who found some of the performances extraordinary.  I cannot believe that Fergie was the greatest thing on here, but her duet with Mick Jagger, backed by U2, is just an amazing moment.  She blows Bono and Jagger OFF THE STAGE.  She's that good.

Simon dueting with Nash and Crosby on George Harrison's Here Comes the Sun...stellar.

Springsteen and Tom Morello--RIVETING.

Springsteen overall contributes the finest set.  Metallica, the worst, in my opinion, but then, I'm not a big fan of metal, so YMMV.  Springsteen was so GENEROUS with all of his guests, which compares rather ill with Stevie Wonder, who barely made space in his song for John Legend.  Springsteen made each of his costars take center stage, so Billy Joel, John Fogarty, Sam Moore, and Darlene Love all got to glow and shine. When it was just Bruce and the E Street Band, he was awesome as well.  I'm a much bigger U2 and Paul Simon fan than I am a Springsteen fan, but you gotta get this DVD just to see Bruce...

My copy had some hiccups, and I still haven't watched Disc 3.  But so far...AMAZING",1287014400,8,1081,4.572916666666667
4236365,2,B003ZVU1P0,"Oh my! This is BORING (so far)!  And the performers generally looked tired--alternating between whithering or bloating--and apparently very sentimental: just witness Stevie trying to get through singing MJ's ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" without getting emotional...he failed miserably (SPOILER ALERT)!

Tom Hanks previews the concert with a faux-poetic, nearly incomprehensable diatribe on American Pop Music, then Jerry Lee Lewis, obviously a cipher from his glory days, opens the concert all by his lonesome.  Since Lewis wasn't anchored by a hot young band he clearly showcases his physical and mental decline. Very sad really.  The CS and N, Simon/Simon and Garfunkel, Stevie Wonder sets which soon followed Lewis were uninspiring ""oldies sessions,"" having a few uptempo songs, but mostly labored on slow ballads or midtempos that didn't really soar.  (CSN's Woodstock and Almost Cut My Hair were decent exceptions!) And the collaborations in each set (Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Brown, Sting, John Legend, so far) didn't heighten, enliven or even validate these heavily plodding proceedings.

Will soldier on to the Aretha Franklin's set presently, but I don't think after watching the first 90 minutes or so, I'll be able to finish the concert.  I will finish...if the Springsteen and Metallica sets throw ""b>>>s to the wall.""  I'm currently thinking the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame:Legends box set is clearly the one to have.",1286755200,8,1422,5.316964285714286

B.B. King, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, John Fogarty, Darlene Love, John Legend, Stevie Wonder and on and on and on --- I have incredible memories of this night from being there but now I can watch it all again with a ""front row"" point of view.",1286323200,3,587,4.70873786407767
4236368,4,B003ZVU1P0,"I tried to wait till October 12, when The Rolling Stones' ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" will be released so I'll order ""Rock & Roll"" together with that and a few others. And I could not wait past three days. I had to run to Best Buy to find ""R&R"".

Other than the superb performances and video quality of the disks I find one other thing most pleasing. Disk 1 contains classic rock performances. If that's all you care for you'll find disk 1 very satisfying with no reason to skip chapters.  Metallica is on disk 2.

While the DVD version of ""R&R"" has three disks the B-Ray version has two. If you regularly skip bonus material on disks don't do so with these; you'll miss a lot. Each disk has bonus performances.

It is disappointing to buy a video disk only to discover that the 2-channel audio option delivers better audio than the multi-channel option. That is my experience with this blu-ray release. In this case it's the center speaker that is out of balance with the rest when you choose the M/C option- it's too loud.

Check out Collective Soul's ""Home"" blu-ray disk for a comparison. ""Home"" is the standard in blu-ray audio (in my experience).",1286236800,3,1146,4.543689320388349

This DVD is full of great performances, the audio and video are top notch, and it is a must buy, however, it is a shame that Disc 3 with the ""bonus performances"", is marred with audio video synching problems.

As stated by another reviewer, the producers should have moved all the material cut from the HBO special (the bonus performances) into the regular concert as it was performed during October 29th and 30th, 2009, for a better viewing experience.  And in the process, they would have been forced to fix the audio video sync.

I have vowed not to erase it until it is released on Blu Ray and DVD, and finally owning this will be a welcome treat!

If you're wondering why the Blu Ray version of the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concert is available at Amazon 30 days after the DVD release date, it's because the Blu Ray version of the package is available only at Best Buy for the first 30 days. Man, I hate that. But I've waited now for a year for this release, so waiting an extra 30 days is no sweat I guess. Anyway....

If you were at The 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concerts or you saw it when it aired on HBO you already know how awesome these performances were that occurred over the course of two nights in late October 2009. If you haven't seen this and you like music, even just a little, you're in for a great experience. This collection is worth its weight in gold.

The great news is that the DVD and Blu Ray releases include a ton of bonus stuff that wasn't aired on HBO, so it'll be great fun again for me to give this entire release a fresh look.

According to Time Life, following is what's going to be on the release, and I've marked the standout performances with this mark: *****  Rest assured that almost every performance stands out; it's all a matter of musical preference. I like all kinds of music with a preference for hard rock, but some of these performances truly converted me into a fan of acts that I never liked or really paid little attention to prior to seeing this:

Disc 1 & 2 is presented as the main program & Disc 3 are the ""extra"" performeses.  they're only extra because they were chopped out of the original concert.  since they are all from the same concert, i wish the producers would have just spread the whole concert over all 3 discs in its original set order instead of chopping some songs to the 3rd disc.

However, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has pulled off this almost impossible task with aplomb.  The performances by rock and roll artists from the early days and from recent times are uniformly solid and the sound quality is great.  There are too many highlights to list - and everyone will have personal favorites.  For me, Paul Simon's set sounds so right, the Bruce Springsteen-Billy Joel duets are a lot of fun, and Fergie and Mick Jagger nail ""Gimmie Shelter"" (with U2 as their backing band).  There are a lot of ""wow"" moments.  Despite the sense of history that comes with being a R&R Hall of Fame event, this concert is just rocking good fun.",1285891200,,805,4.633802816901408

4236377,4,B003ZVU1P0,"First off, a  few people have said this is the greatest show they ever saw, etc.  Actually the original R&R HoF concert in Cleveland in 1995 was a much better tribute to the spirit of rock and roll.  Maybe becasue the artists were 15 years younger too.  While a great show, it tends to be an oldies show, and I am a HUGE fan of many of the artists that appeared, and I was at both nights at The Garden.
  But my biggest problem is that this was not released on Blu-Ray.  There simply isn't a reason for this not to have been done.

Finally, HBO if you are listening, please release the original R&R HoF concert!",1285804800,,611,4.162393162393163

While the HBO special (and these discs) were edited for time, they absolutely do these shows justice. (Do we really need to see the first take of ""Because The Night"", when Patty Smith messed up....no). It looks to me like they got this one right. I can honestly say that whoever purchases this will not be dissappointed in the least.

I am not the type of person who ever posts comments about items that I have bought, I always look to see what others are writing, but I felt that this time I had to write something. If you like great Rock n Roll and have about 5 1/2 hours to kill, put on your dancin shoes, grab the spouse, kids, neighbors, strangers off the street, throw this in the DVD player and crank up your stereo as loud as it will go (until the cops come....and I guarantee they will dance with you as well) and get ready for a great time.

8411079,4,B003ZVU1P0,"Stevie Wonder is pure amaze. Sting was great. Paul Simon's guitar needs better intonation, but whatev. tough on an acoustic with no bridge adjustment, maybe due to capo position. Did sound great next song when capo off neck. Do check out Buddy Guy. His voice sounded great and strong and way younger sounding than he is. Very impressive singing Mr. Guy. His guitar sounded awesome too, and it seems he is not above learning new techniques as he had some shred in those blues licks too.",1517097600,,485,4.651162790697675
8411080,3,B003ZVU1P0,"Classic nostalgia music from a wide range of performers with rare together stuff. The highlight is Fergie, Jagger and U2 doing Gimme Shelter. Others have done the vocals to this song but Fergie stole the show and is the best. Got the concert just for that. The rest is icing on the cake.",1516838400,,287,4.433962264150943
8411081,3,B003ZVU1P0,I didn't think some of these performances were very good.  Skipped over a couple that were downright bad.  Not great sound quality on this film.  Glad I didn't pay for it; saw it with Prime for free.,1514505600,,199,4.324324324324325

DURING THE JOHN LEGEND SECTION, STEVIE DOES MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL'  HE GETS OVERWHELMED WITH EMOTION AND CAN'T SING FOR A SHORT MINUTE THEN COMES BACK STRONG.  STEVIE MAY HAVE REQUESTED TO REMOVE IT  OR THE PRODUCERS DIDN'T DECIDED NOT TO SHOW THE UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE.  YOU CAN WATCH THE DELETED PART ON YOU TUBE.",1512691200,,397,4.695652173913044
