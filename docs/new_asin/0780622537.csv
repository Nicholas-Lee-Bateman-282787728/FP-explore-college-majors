32727,5,0780622537,"This movie is without a doubt my foavorite movie of all time. I first saw it at a dollar theatre, and was hooked immediately. It boasts a perfect sonata of a cast, with Goodman and Washington complementing each other  wonderfully. Washington's performance is amazingly realistic...the smallest  things he does are the most impressive. The plot is unbeatable, and the  ending is a masterpiece. One of the few movies with a rebelliously  unethical end. Sports the most effectively used ""credits"" song in  history. Not to be missed for any reason...ignore the  ""professional"" critics, trust your own reactions.",917136000,5,607,5.270833333333333
32728,4,0780622537,"This is a new variant on a serial killer theme.  As with a lot of recent movies you have to watch this one.  A complex plot, a type of reality/fantasy story that keeps you glued to the story, thank God it's a  DVD and I can flick back!  Most of the movie is filmed during the hours of  darkness, and I came away with an impession of gloom and doom.  Don't  misunderstand me, this is what was intended and it creats an appropriate  mood.  Very well acted, I have to single out Denzel Washington.  He does a  very good job with this story, and is an underated actor.  The storyline  about a supernatural killer makes for a compelling plot.  Full of twists  and turns and suprises, I was kept guessing up to the end.  This DVD is  well transferred, both sound and picture.  See this one, I do not think you  will be diappointed.",915667200,3,825,4.240259740259741
32729,5,0780622537,"A genius creation of motion picture at his best, both superb camera work and great acting make this movie a one that you will not forget easily. It has the psychological angle that sits in your mind, long after the credit  rolled. The best feature of this movie, is one that can't be found easily  in the cinema these days, that it is completely, utterly unexpected. You  think you can predict the end, well, the director will prove you wrong.  I,  myself, rate it a the top of the list.",914630400,2,487,4.366666666666666
32730,5,0780622537,"The movie Fallen was a very suspenceful thriller with a very good plot and great acting.

32758,4,0780622537,"I found the premise of trying to stop a demon who lives in this world and moves by touch especially intriguing. I enjoyed the suspense and thrilling aspect of the film.

I do think it is a bit of a plot-driven narrative and the characterization could be expanded and developed more. Still, the thrill ride is there and will keep you perched on the seat's edge. Denzel is poised and on beat as usual. I have yet to see a film of his that I didn't like. Pacing is done well, good cinematography, and nice tie-ins and a twist or two. I've watched this film several times over the years and I always enjoy it!",1500854400,3,605,4.260869565217392

32924,5,0780622537,"Fallen is a well thought out, dark and intense supernatural thriller. And it's very rare in today's times that you can find even a decent supernatural thriller/horror.

Detective John Hobbes is one of the city's finest detectives and is preparing for the execution of serial killer, Edgar Reese. A serial killer he'd been pursuing for months. Just before Reese is executed he talks to Hobbes in tongues and gives him a riddle ""Why is there space between Lyons and Spakowsky?"" Hobbes brushes it off and witnesses Reese's execution.

Soon after, more murders begin taking place around the city and all in similar fashion, appearing to have a copycat killer on their hands. The killer's calling cards consist of riddles being written on the victim's walls as well as oddly leaving a bowl of sugared corn flakes neatly positioned on kitchen table. After doing some research along with some assistance from a woman named Gretta Milano; detective Hobbes discovers that the archangel/demon, Azazel possessed Edgar Reese, was responsible for all the murders that took place, and can switch from body to body with a simple touch. Upon discovering this, John Hobbes engages in a war with Azazel as he rushes to look for a way to put an end to Azazel's murderous ways. But how can he possibly stop a killer that's a spirit and can possess anyone he comes in contact with, with a simple touch?

Overall: What a movie! Fallen was on my to watch list for the longest time and after managing to find this movie for a relatively cheap price, I'm glad to say that this forgotten gem is in my collection. Denzel Washington, who always delivers in his movies, puts on an unforgettable performance as protagonist; Detective John Hobbes. The plot of Fallen is not only creepy but intense and deeply psychological; telling of a war against evil that seemingly can't be won. Once you begin watching, you won't want to stop watching until the very end. The ending tends to be a bit confusing at first don't hesitate to re-watch the ending or search the web for answers about it. In addition to the intense and vivid story, the acting that takes place is also A+ and every character in this movie does a fantastic job and playing their parts to a T. When it all comes down it, I highly suggest putting Fallen on your to-watch list.",1420675200,,2306,4.71712158808933

FALLEN is a finely plotted 1998 sleeper hit that hybrids crime-suspense with the supernatural in a way I've never seen done before. Great performances by Denzel Washington and virtually everyone else, with special bravos going to Embeth Davidtz and Tony Donnelly. While there are a few minor plot-holes and ambiguities, FALLEN tells its rather incredible story very well, with well-planned surprises, particularly at the end. Excellent loaded dialogue, e.g., ""People just want the world to make sense,"" and the voice-overs from Detective John Hobbes (Washington), along with another character you'll just have to hear for yourself, contribute a great deal.

I watch a lot of films of this sort, and FALLEN looked like it would probably be pretty standard stuff. Nevertheless, I was stunned by what a unique and clever piece this truly is.",1398297600,,851,5.25

Denzel Washington plays a detective who learns the person he caught and was subsequently executed for a crime was just a patsy. Detective John Hobbes learns the secret of Azazel, an ancient spirit who enters bodies simply by touch.  Once in, the the victims have no recollection of anything from that point and are expected to do Azazel's bidding.

This movie gives the Rolling Stone's Time is on My Side a sinister side.  You'll not soon hear that song without thinking of this movie.

32994,5,0780622537,I have always loved this movie. I watched it as a young child and the song the killer kept singing stayed with me. Kinda freaked me out as a kid. Great movie tho,1395187200,,161,3.909090909090909
32995,2,0780622537,"I was looking forward to watching this movie.  I already knew the ""secret"" about who or what the serial killer was before I sat down to view it, but it didn't really matter as the movie didn't make much use of it as it turns out.  The movie was slow, very slow, and filmed in this murky, shadowy kind of way that I supposed was meant to make it seem creepy or dark, but it didn't really make the movie scarier.  In fact, this movie wasn't really scary at all.  The plot rambled on, making little use of the great crew of actors in it--Washington, Goodman, Sutherland.  None of them could save this movie from being predictable and bland.

Some spoilers below:

So, these cops are investigating what seems like the work of a serial killer, save for it doesn't seem to be the same person.  Denzel's character goes deeper into the mystery and eventually figures out that it isn't some bad guy killing people, but a demon thousands of years old who is inside people making them do bad things.  He tracks down this demon's name and then is plagued by the demon, who keeps jumping from person to person, until Denzel ends up on the run from his own cop buddies.  Oh, but wait, he finds a way to kill the demon...at a great sacrifice to himself.

Of course, this single paragraph takes a LONG time to happen in the movie, while we are treated to snatches of ""time on my side"" as sung by the demon and lots of scenes that don't serve much purpose.  If the plot had included more soul-searching by the main character, if the demon had been more than just a plot device (he has no reason to torment this cop rather than just killing him outright...I guess just being a demon is enough reason?), and if the movie had more properly addressed the question of Good vs Evil, I think it might have been a far better movie.  As it is, it fails as a horror movie, it fails as a thriller, and it isn't much of a mystery.

I don't blame the actors.  I blame the scriptwriter and the director.  Worth watching once.  Maybe.  Not worth watching a second time and definitely not a keeper.",1394755200,,2065,4.333333333333333

33015,1,0780622537,"This movie had such promise, such potential.  In the first half hour, we see John Goodman, James Gandolfini, and Donald Sutherland: not actors you'd expect to find in a film whose basic premise, as it slowly -- ever so slowly -- unfolds, is a goofy little morality play about the Devil working havoc on Earth.  Supposedly, evil can be transferred from person to person by mere touch, as if it were some virulent form of leprosy.  While this seems innocuous enough at the outset, it rapidly becomes hopelessly banal.  Oooh, Azazel is the demon's name!

It surprised me in one way, however.  We live in a culture that is largely secular and decreasingly Christian; yet Fallen is designed to appeal to people whose catechism in based in 19th Century theology.

By the end, it became clear what a miserable concoction this really is.  Goodman, Gandolfini, and Sutherland have nothing more than cameo roles.  Denzel Washington does his best with a story that falls apart after the first half hour, but even his talents can't save a hopeless retread like Fallen.",1374969600,3,1056,4.822222222222222

I can promise you that from start to finish there is not a single fault in this movie. I enjoyed every bit of it. It is full of ""the supernatural"", just plain horror and pulse pounding excitement. Another great movie by Denzel who has only fallen flat on a very, very few occasions in his extremely lengthy list of movies. I really do highly recommend this movie to any and everyone. There is no explicit gore and the violence is more of the supernatural type so I don't think young children would be severely damaged by watching this movie as long as you take the time to remind them that its just a made up scary movie. I would recommend it for all but the very young in the family but I am a bit more open to such matters than most. I would avoid letting the very young watch the movie simply because they tend to need to relieve themselves during movie highlights and who wants to hit the pause button during a great scene in a movie?

James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas, Gabriel Casseus, Michael J.

I'm not a horror movie fan (and I admit that I don't know that this truly qualifies as horror), as I usually find them to be more about shock than anything like real dread. Something jumps out of the dark, or a mirror swings closed to reveal someone behind the viewer.  Or, lately, a lot of crawling on ceilings...

I don't see the point in being jolted, or disgusted (which one must admit is the primary goal of a lot of these films).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B001H1SW4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-2003/dp/B00351LYIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel-Unrated/dp/B007HOD2WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel Unrated</a>&nbsp;are just gore fests that seem to fall apart when you realize they're just pulling your strings.

But ""FALLEN"" came along and really nailed it...it's an underrated movie that has been around 15 years, never gotten its just desserts, and has a stellar cast and crew known for great, quality film making.  So how come so many people have never seen this?

Is it a horror film?  I think it's more along the lines of another great movie that most people missed at the theaters:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frailty/dp/B0088C2VWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frailty</a>, starring Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey - a terrific film that unsettles the soul through great acting and a genuinely frightening story line.

Finding a movie like this is a real treat: ""Fallen"" is a thriller in the classic sense, like lifting a rock and finding something under it that disquiets you, that shakes you and makes you squirm in your seat.  It's well constructed, and though a bit long at 125 minutes, it is a great movie to watch late at night while the wind howls outside.

You probably already know the basics-- serial killer is executed, yet someone is still committing crimes using his M.O.--but it's what lies beyond them that makes this film deliciously disturbing.  I especially liked the way the ""villain"" is revealed to us: slowly, bit by bit, through hints and good old detective work, the impossibilities are stripped away until what's left is almost as dreadful as one could imagine.

As most people know, it is the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that drives a work of fiction: as it is how much we accept in the story that governs whether agree to its premise.  If we do not perceive that incredible things may occur, then the story has no belly and no backbone, and in effect might as well be done away with before we go any further.

And it's here that the quality of the work comes into play: Denzel Washington plays detective John Hobbes, the man who put serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) in the executioner's chair.  But the movie doesn't exactly start there: it starts with Hobbes' very interesting line: ""Let me tell you about the day I almost died."" How this figures into the movie - beginning middle, or end -- we're not exactly told, but it sets up a KEY scene; we're sure of that.

Hobbes and his fellow cops - John Goodman and James Gandalfini, and supervisor Donald Sutherland - cannot help but notice something disturbing: following Reese's execution, the killings have not stopped.  And make no doubt about it, these murders follow the EXACT methodology as Reese's, right down to procedures never released to the public.

And from here on in, things get weird, very weird.

What is particularly effective about this movie is that the action is carried forward through several vantage points...and one of the plusses is that it increases believability.  It's avoids lengthy verbal explanations, as not a lot has to be explicated when we've already seen what occurred.

What this also does is advances separate plot lines that will merge, with John Hobbes as the point of convergence.

I am surprised to find that several negative reviews mentioned a slow-moving plot line.  What some may not be saying is that the movie is not a slave to action sequences.  I thought it was paced well, and felt, if anything, that things were moving briskly.  The only thing this movie is NOT, is a slam-banging, fist fighting, car chasing extravaganza.  I felt it was intelligently scripted and the action took place at a great tempo.

The writing is sensationalistic according to much of what we can expect from Hollywood, but it further muddies the waters about knowledge about the demonic. Demons cannot be killed & do not die.

Furthermore, no one enters heaven because they ""deserve"" to do so (as a little boy was told about his dad in this film), though Hollywood insissts on promulgating that lie in film after film. Anyone actually entering heaven does so ONLY because of belief in God's grace based on what Jesus did for them.

 everything about it is haunting, making it a sure fire halloween time movie to watch. however, because of the subject matter, not for younger children. the majority of the story will be over their heads, but the violence makes it an older teen movie.

33169,2,0780622537,"It's a decent movie (only in that it is well-made with good actors) but is not scary and could have been much better. I enjoy watching movies with Denzel Washington in them and so that made it worthwhile. It had a okay premise, though not that original: an executed man can transfer his soul from person to person by the slightest touch and thus continue living and killing; how can a mere detective really stop him?

Answer: he doesn't. He tried, but the ending was disappointing. I was under the impression that Denzel (Detective John Hobbes) was going to be successful. The demon in its host is led out into the middle of nowhere and is shot...the detective makes it so that he will also die, thus
the demon will have nobody alive to transfer to and will expire.

Yet the demon lives-on through a regular house cat that happens to wander out of the woods and that's the end. We're told earlier on that the demon would have ""just a breath"" to make it to another host. It should have expired right away since that cat didn't arrive until much later.

A cooler ending would have been if too-much time had passed and we see the demon being destroyed because it didn't make it. . .and then the cat appeared. That would leave you wondering about how it almost survived.

Also, something else neat would have been is if a deer was in the wooded area (which would be more likely). I picture the demon taking over the deer...it running away (and the audience thinking the movie's over)...but then the animal gets shot a hunter hiding from a distance and the demon couldn't make it to the new host in time.

Another idea: What if Detective Hobbes became a Christian? A demon cannot occupy the same place as the Holy Spirit. Hobbes didn't have to end his life; he could have been on the lookout for any other animals to kill so that the demon Azazel wouldn't have a host. Evidently, though, he wasn't thinking of animals in the woods as being potential hosts. Still, Hobbes would have eventually been found guilty of killing the boss and he was already being framed...so he was in a bad situation. I know this wasn't meant to come across a spiritually-accurate film or one for Christians, but this is a plot-point that could have taken place and it would have been intriguing. It would have been good to see Denzel's character deal with faith and have some character development.

It's pretty sad, I'd say, seing how the demon could enter EVERYBODY in the city (except Hobbes, again, for some unknown reason) it encountered. Well, it does show/imply that this is a world with fallen, sinful people who have no reverence for God and that it was easy for the fallen angel to posess them. There were NO believers???

As for the demon not surviving in the end, it wouldn't have worked anyway -- according to the script -- because the story starts with the narration of how it ""almost died"". Of course, while watching the movie, you hear any narration in the voice of Denzel's and his character -- yet it's really the demon telling you his story. I thought that was a neat idea that fooled me.

OTHER, VARIOUS THOUGHTS:

- Before the killer (Reese) was placed in the gas chamber, why didn't the demon that possessed him just enter one of the guards? The killer (which, we learn, is guilty all because of the demon's long-term possession that made him kill) was already going to die, so the demon should have just left...but there'd be no movie, then.

- Not only can the demon pass from body by touch, but -- as the DVD case says -- by the brush of clothing? That's even more ridiculous.

- The lady (daughter of the former officer Milano) tells Hobbes that Reese was posessed by the demon Azazel...and that ""it didn't work"" when Reese shook Hobbes' hand (Reese tried to takeover Hobbes then). Why didn't it work? What was so special about him? It's already been established he wasn't a believer in God. He answered the daughter, when she asked about his belief in God, that he went to church at times (which ultimately is not an answer and
going to a building doesn't prove anything).

- Why would it be that Azazel would have to kill whatever host he occupies before he could then
enter Hobbes? Remember at the end fight, when Jonesy/Azazel asked Hobbes why he wouldn't let him kill himself? Jonesy/Azazel said he wanted to do it so he could ""become"" Hobbes and that would end up with Hobbes eventually being guilty of killing Jonesy + the boss. Thus, it was similar to how Milano was set-up in the past.

- It would have been more realistic if, once the demon moved into someone else, the former host
would experience shock and react like ""What the heck happened to me? Where am I?"" All of the people just have moments of amnesia/forgetfulness and just go about their business no matter what. Silly.

The DVD contains a commentary as the main special-feature but is otherwise bare-bones. It's okay for a rental.",1307664000,2,4901,4.554545454545455
33170,5,0780622537,"The protagonist in this film is a dedicated detective, Hobbes, who discovers that crimes are being committed by Azazel, a demon who existed from the beginning of time. The name Azazel is taken from the Bible, Leviticus 16, which states that there were two Yom Kippur holiday goats; one was offered to God as a sacrifice and the second was sent to Azazel. The meaning of Azazel is obscure. Many rational commentators say it means a rocky mountain area. Others read it superstitiously and say that Azazel is one name of a demon that lives in the rocky mountain area. This film combines the latter notion with the superstition that there were fallen angels who God threw out of heaven (based on Genesis 6). These angels, later called demons, who live forever, decided to take revenge on God by doing all kinds of harm to humans. This is the Azazel that Hobbes encounters. The film gives the demon an additional power: whenever he touches a person, the touched person, with few exceptions, absorbs and becomes Azazel. The film contains much irony.

For example, the writers of this movie have the evil Azazel speak Aramaic, which is an ancient language spoken throughout the near east, including Israel, from the middle of the fist millennium BCE to near the end of the first millennium CE. The irony lays in the fact that not only was Aramaic the language of all people, not demons, it was also the language spoken by Jesus, who was not a demon.

A second irony is the detective's name, Hobbes. While the film is based on superstition and the irrational, the great philosopher Thomas Hobbes was just the opposite. He insisted that people should be rational. Many scholars believe that he went so far as to reject religion and mock people who were religious. Hobbes is the 17th century philosopher who wrote ""The Leviathan"" in which he describes how society developed. Uncontrolled human nature, according to Hobbes, is filled with robbery and murder, a miserable state of war, where each individual, is looking out for his own welfare. This state of anarchy is remedied by the creation of society and sensible laws.",1303257600,,2112,4.799450549450549

33173,4,0780622537,"Fallen creates a fascinating situation out of what could have been nothing more than a gimmick. A demon returned to Earth is free to pass from body to body, unless the body should die while he is in it. But he can only pass through touch. This premise leads to a unique and effective cinematographic technique--the flight of the demon from his pursuers, and his current location is determined by a sweeping, racing camera chasing down crowded streets. This could get old, but what it brings out is that every body the demon inhabits is affected by him, taken over by him in a sense, but yet retains its own character. People remain themselves and the demon simultaneously, and we're forced to confront the mix of good and evil that can reside in even the most innocent, helpless looking individuals.",1285027200,,799,4.714285714285714

I recently caught this movie on TV again and each time I see it, I marvel at how underrated it has been.  It has an absolutely top-notch cast.  It has an unique and very imaginative plot.  It is extremely scary and most attractively---what rarely goes with supernatural films---intelligence and logic.  One of my tests of quality is always the value of rewatching a film.  This one is worth a look every couple of years.

One last, rather unlikely, titbit to remind viewers of.  Denzel Washington plainly likes playing the role of a cop in his films, but this is one of at least three SF/horror films he's made in which he plays a cop.  Doesn't seem much like his genre, but he evidently recognizes quality in a fantastic yarn when he sees it.  I recommend, from that trio, Deja Vu as well.",1282435200,,961,4.502890173410405

33186,3,0780622537,"Touted as supernatural thriller / film noir, FALLEN hasn't dated well at all.  The truth is: the show while beautifully filmed, is too tame and slow to generate any real thrills.  The average viewer would get more suspense out of watching an episode of CSI.  The film fails primarily because it tries to incorporate too many genres and falls short in each.

The only reason to watch this movie of course is Denzel Washington - who's never had a bad performance.  The able cast around him - Donald Sutherland, John Goodman, James Gandolfini et al - don't do much either.  The film is ultimately very PG in treatment, which works against it.  Denzel fans will get their fix, but that's about it.

The plot involves an evil spirit which moves from body to body, killing people along the way.  A police detective played by DW eventually figures out what's happening, and he comes up with a plan to kill the evil spirit itself.  You can watch the movie to see how it turns out ...

As far as deeper meaning, the main message I discerned is that maybe reality is stranger than we realize or can even imagine, and maybe that's why no one can explain why there's so much evil in the world.

But overall, this movie is meant to entertain rather than teach anything, and the entertainment is in the genre of what I would call 'scary suspense'.  Though I found this movie gripping, with plenty of unexpected twists, this isn't a genre I care for, so my personal rating is only 3 stars.

I liked how the script mixed a supernatural thriller with a classic serial killer police film. I thought the cast did a good job of acting their roles. One of the best things I liked about the film was the end and that it's a bit of a shock

I don't have a ton of bad things to say about this film,but here is a few. I love Denzel,but he seems to play the same character in all his film,the smart,intelligent,heroic black man. I'd love to see him act a bit different in some of these films or at least play an extremely different type of character. Also all the actors did a good job,but none of them really stood out to me. There is nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before in films like this where a killer has the ability to jump bodies even though it's done well. Also I would have liked the main villain to have had more motivation rather than I'm a evil dude that likes killing. I kind of like my main bad guys to have some kind of motivations or plan for why they are doing what they are doing.

33191,4,0780622537,"I'm going to tell you about a movie I almost like...

""Fallen"" has always intrigued me. On the one hand, I really shouldn't like it. It's slow paced, the supernatural ingredients border the frivolous (a demon that makes people sing Rolling Stones?), and the ending is all wrong. Damn that cat!

And yet...

And yet, I find myself watching it every time Swedish TV reruns it. The actors are one reason: Denzel Washington, Donald Sutherland and John Goodman. The plot is also quite interesting. And if you have the right sense of humour, you might even appreciate the idea of a demon singing like Mick Jagger!

The main character of the movie, detective John Hobbes, is chasing a strange killer who turns out to be an ancient demon or fallen angel, named Azazel. The demon kills several people and then attempts to frame Hobbes for the murders. One of the victims is Hobbes' own brother. Azazel has the ability to jump from person to person, making them demon-possessed. Hobbes soon realizes that another police officer, Milano, has fought the demon. Before committing suicide under mysterious circumstances, Milano left a number of occult books in an abandoned mountain cabin. From these books, Hobbes finds out that Azazel has one fatal weakness: the demon can't survive in dead bodies, and it dies itself if it cannot switch hosts within a few seconds. Chased by the entire police force, Hobbes decides to lure Azazel into the wilderness, where there are no humans to be possessed within miles. The stage is set for a final show down between Man and Fallen Angel.

I won't reveal how the movie ends, but I would have appreciated another ending. If you've seen ""Fallen"", you know what I mean. Frankly, the ending annoys me!

Still, I give the movie four stars. As already mentioned, the actors are great, the plot is interesting, and the strange lack of action (in a movie filled with murders!) is actually quite relaxing.

33195,4,0780622537,"First may I say that this is an excellent movie on Spiritual forces that motivate people to do evil. The script involves a Philadelphia Homicide Detective who accidentally stumbles on the reality of the Devil. Detective ""Hobbes"", which if you do some checking, the double ""b"" was the ancient name for the Devil in England. A tribute to "" Quatermass and the Pit"", a British horror movie on Evil and Martian inheritance,is played very well by Denzel Washington and John Goodman as his partner serves a great supporting role. As explained by others, spirits move by either contact or death of a host. Once known, they hound the discoverer to his/her death, ala' ""Mary Rose"".
  By control of people, places and events they can lead you to do what you don't wish to do and force everything against you. When we encounter ""possessed"" people, we see what they see. A slightly off color spectrum, not quite as good as the human eye. This was similar (along with the background music) to ""Wolfen"" with Albert Finney, and the quick movement is obviously drawn from that film.
  As to sight gags, there is one scene where Hobbes feels that he is being followed. He sees a shadow climbing the train station (looks like North Philadelphia Station). When he gets to the top, The "" presence"" is felt but Hobbes can't see him. However, if you look closely at the station sign, you will see the word ""Willoughby"" very clearly. This of course was the mythical station of Gart Williams, who jumped off the train in a famous ""Twilight Zone"" episode to escape the stress of his corporate job where he sees a peaceful community set in the 1800s and walks off with the old conductor in that time, but is in fact the name of a funeral parlor in the modern world as his actions are chalked up to suicide where he is said to have jumped from the train shouting ""Willoughby""
  Little things like these keep showing up during the film. Strange artwork inside buildings, all related to the Devil or Angels and The ""witching hour"" phone calls at 3AM.  The humans involved who know living like mendicant monks, afraid to get involved with others because of the fear of peril for the innocent. Also the Rolling Stones music ""Time is on my side"" and ""Sympathy for the Devil"", all very appropriate in their roles for this work.
Very close to the spiritual truth, save for the mortality of evil and certain mumbo jumbo. Philadelphia locations are excellent. Geno's versus Pat's steaks continue their war in this work and there is a lot of Septa Rail line filming, sections of Manayunk, City hall courtyard and the old Holmesburg Prison.

33197,5,0780622537,"I can't believe this movie eluded me for so long. I've seen all sorts of horror movies... slasher, goth, psychological, and zombie flicks. However, Fallen is easily one of the best I've ever seen. Seriously, I'd put it up there with The Exorcist,The Silence of the Lambs, and Se7en. Even though it clearly has religious themes in it, religion is not an important factor in order to enjoy the movie. Denzel Washington does an excellent job at portraying Detective Hobbes, who is bent on trying to find a copycat of the serial killer Reese. But we soon find out that Hobbes is not hunting a copycat serial killer, but a demon called Azazel, who can jump from person to person simply by touching them, which he uses to taunt and toy with Hobbes. Through discovering a person who Azazel possessed in order to kill people, he found a cop who sent out to kill him, but ultimately failed. He meets his daughter, an angelologist. Together, they try to find a way to kill Azazel. There's more to it than that, but that's all I'll get in to so as to not spoil it.

The last 15 or so minutes of the film are some of the most powerful I've seen in any film. The action, the dialogue, and the unveilment of Hobbes' plan. There's even a twist near the end which is very unexpected, yet still fits within the story. There is a theme here, which I believe is that there is evil in everyone, no matter how good or innocent we may consider them to be.

33203,5,0780622537,"...but when it happens.  People don't always understand it--or accept it."" John Hobbes, ""Fallen.""

Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) should be at the top of his game.  He's captured and sent to the gas chamber one of the most nefarious killers--Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas).  Unfortunately, Reese may have had an accomplice--because murders are starting to happen with his same MO.

Worse, people all around him are starting to sing ""Time is on my Side"" the song Reese sang before he was put to sleep.

When the facts of the case are resistant to interpretation, Hobbes discovers via Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz), the daughter of another cop who had a similar experience, that Reese was possessed by the Demon, Azazel, one of the ""Fallen"" who lives serially in mortals and is transmitted from one host to another by touch.

Now, a cop who bases his judgment on evidence is going to have to fight a criminal who he can't see and isn't quite sure he believes in. But he does believe in evil--and he wants the evil to stop.

Some of my favorite films are blended genres. ""Fallen"" is one of the most underestimated examples of mystery-horror that I've seen. The film's fast-paced and well-acted.

""Fallen"" does come with a warning label or two:

don't watch if you have a low threshold for suspense

This is a truly underrated gem. The script is genius, with many complex levels that take a few viewings to get, and the acting is uniformly excellent. Denzel is very fine as usual, Goodman is solid, Sutherland and Embeth shine in their supporting roles, and the whole thing is full of x-factor.

Hoblit hits his stride here, with gorgeous shots, his beautifully symmetrical frame compositions adding to the religious/church-gone-haywire feeling. Everything comes together---acting, script, plot, cinematography, lighting, color scheme, music, atmosphere---to create a perfect evocation of the creepy weirdness inherent in the brilliant story.
A must if you like any of the following: Denzel; the occult; the Bible; suspense; psycho-thrillers; late-night-alone scary movies with no violence.

Yes, the best part here is that you get all the scares with almost none of the violence. Great filmmakers don't need to show blood and gore to make a film work. Only bad ones need to do that. Hitchcock and friends know that what you DON'T see is scarier than what you do. Fallen is the epitome of that tenet.

As for the ending not working, the reviewers who say that have missed the gist here. I think the ending is genius, and ties everything together perfectly. That it's a very non-traditional, non-hollywood ending makes it even better. This film forces you to think, and to question your assumptions about what is real. Not an easy feat.

The story is pure ""Hollywood theology"" mean also means the characters - include the heroes - in here have no clue about God or the purpose of life.

The DVD provides excellent entertainment. The visuals are decent on this disc and sound-effects are chilling in spots. As the demon sees through the eyes of people and passes by with these ""whoosh"" sounds, it's very effective.

Perhaps there are people out there who would find Fallen to be a scary horror movie, but for me, I did not. I did thoroughly enjoy it and am delighted to have it grace my collection.

Denzel plays a detective, and we first come into the story as one of the criminals he's putting away gets executed. But the criminal is possessed by a demon (as I type this, it sounds like such a stupid idea, but it really isn't...I promise!) and the demon is a shapeshifter, meaning it has no body of its own, so it possesses the bodies of anything living and has done so for a very long time. As the demon hides out in the bodies of others, it kills and leaves identical crime scenes, trying to throw Denzel off. But he soon figures it out. And every time someone sings a certain song, you know it's the demon. This one's a toughie to explain further without ruining the intrigue of the film.

""Fallen"" starts with convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice Detective Jon Hobbes (Denzel Washington) looks on. Hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named Muscovich (Glen Witko) in a bathtub having been poisoned, the same way Reese used to kill his victims. At first Hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name Robert Milano comes up, a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide. Hobbes speaks with his daughter Gretta (Embeth Davidtz) who at first is reluctant to speak with him. Things become even stranger when the man who killed Muscovich, Charles (Robert Joy) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again. Eventually Gretta tells Hobbes the truth, he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called Azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch. The demon Azazel seems to be taunting Hobbes, ruining his life & career, setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family. Hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about.

Charismatic leading man Denzel Washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range, while John Goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to James Gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character. Donald Sutherland doesn't prove to have any range, doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies. Embeth Davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress. She delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future.  The directing and camera work in this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town.  Although this film does require your full attention, it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours.  ""Fallen"" is an intelligently written, supremely efficiently executed, and one of the most unheralded, unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade.  One of the better of its kind.",1135814400,5,2627,4.792035398230088
33238,1,0780622537,"Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.

I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.

But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.

By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....

The script is idiot from page one.

The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.

But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.

Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.

Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.

Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????

Want more?

In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???

In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).

First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive.

Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.

We have none of that here.

Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.

Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.

But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under ""The story ends bad"" label. Without any depth.

Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.

What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the ""this is an open-ending"" kind of talk!

Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel?

Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: ""Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!""

Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great.",1134777600,13,3513,4.446177847113884
33239,5,0780622537,"John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) is an honest, hardworking, detective who believes in facts, not fantasies. However shortly after the gas chamber execution of convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) a series of events begin to take place that severly challenges his belief system.

Another series of murders begin and the evidence seems to point to an ongoing connection to the deceased Edgar Reese. With the help of Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz) a Theology professor and expert on Angelology, Hobbes eventually comes face to face with the ultimate truth. The real killer is an evil, disembodied spirit named Azazel who randomly possesses humans to carry out his murderous deeds.

Initially and understandably Hobbes has difficulty understanding and accepting this truth. However he is forced to reconsider the possibility when strangers passing by on the street and fellow officers in the police station begin to look his way with a malicious smile and begin singing the classic 60's tune, ""Time Is On My Side"" [the same thing Edgar Reese did in the final moments before his execution]. He realizes Azazel is taunting him as he moves from body to body.

This is an outstanding film of psychological/supernatural horror. You will never be able to listen to that 'Rolling Stones' song again without feeling the presence of Azazel lurking somewhere in the shadows. Magnificent directorial job by Gregory Hoblit and a wonderful all-star cast featuring: Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Donald Sutherland, Elias Koteas (who had a small part but was brilliant) and of course Azazel as himself.",1130889600,2,1633,5.297297297297297
33240,5,0780622537,"This movie is so absolutely incredible. It is a supernatural thriller that happens to be very creepy and exciting. The acting is spot on, notably by Denzel Washington and John Goodman but also by the actor that played the man that got gassed at the beginning.

The movie starts off with a man getting executed in the gas chamber after a cop played by Denzel Washington arrested him. But, when some similiar murders occur, the cop thinks that the man's spirit is still alive and is controlling/posessing people. Everyone thinks he is nuts, even himself, but everything points to him being right.

The scene where the spirit possesses numerous people and says ""time is on my side"" is EXCELLENT. Everytime I hear that phrase, I get chills and get freaked out. I won't tell you why so that you can find out on your own. Buy this movie if you enjoy thrillers like I do because this is almost as good as the silence of the lambs. This is Denzel's best movie! John Goodman is awesome as usual! What an amazing movie!",1123804800,7,1009,4.538461538461538

There's plenty to enjoy here: Satanic scriptures and ancient languages; superb lead acting; hauntingly gorgeous and talented supporting actress...I could go on and on. I didn't even mention how good and convincing Donald Sutherland is.

I am normally not a big fan of Denzel and the roles he chooses; but he's great in this film. It reminds me a little of Sandra Bullock, who has been in so many duds before landing the role in Crash. This is a stand out role for a man not associated with ""horror.""

This is sure to be a classic in the realm of thriller/suspense/horror. It is exciting, mesmerizing and full of suspense!",1122854400,4,717,4.59375
33242,5,0780622537,"This turned out to be a real sleeper of a film, one that came in for criticism because of it's uncharacteristic approach, and the very subtle acting of Denzel Washington, who plays Detective John Hobbes in an understated, almost self-effacing manner.  But the truth is that it is unusually good, and manages to build that dark uneasiness which marks the best in the occult genre without any use of the gruesome or overly dramatic scenes.  This is an actor's film and one that deserves more recognition.

John Hobbes is an honest cop with a knack for bringing in killers, and the film opens with Hobbes attending the execution of Edgar Reese, a serial killer with a poisoner's MO.  But Reese dies unrepentant, challenging Hobbes in ancient Aramaic.  And shortly thereafter, Hobbes and his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) find that the killings have started up again, almost as if Reese had never gone to prison.

Gradually Hobbes realizes that this is far more than a copycat.  One killer is killed by another, there is writing on walls and victims, and a series of clues lead to another cop's suicide, 30 years earlier.  That cop's daughter, Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz) is a theologian, and bit by bit Hobbes realizes that there is something supernatural in the crimes.  A fallen angel, Azazel, is shifting from body to body, wreaking havoc as he goes, and he has Hobbes firmly in his sights.

Azazel wants to bring Hobbes down, ruin his reputation as a policeman, and destroy his life.  Hobbes must find a way to destroy Azazel, but the angel seems unstoppable and unafraid.  Eventually from information garnered from Milano and her father's books, he forms a plan, and the film starts down its path to an unexpected and unnerving conclusion.

Directory Gregory Hoblit manages to keep the acting balances so that everyone from Washington as detective to David Sutherland's character acting as his lieutenant seems at their best.  John Goodman, who has the job of playing to different personalities does almost steal the show.  But the entire cast has to manage Azazel's shifting persona, and they manage to do this without every making the switches seem artificial.  The viewer will come to feel that there is an unembodied persona out there whose intent is utterly maleficent.  This is a surprisingly compelling film for one that avoids the splash of Exorcist or Seven.",1121558400,7,2372,4.919597989949748

  What the F**k was Donald Sutherland's Problem? Other than Guilt,Ignorance & Arrogance, What else did he have to Hide?

33245,4,0780622537,"There have been a lot of mixed comments about this movie over the various review forums on the Net, (other than Amazon, which I have not read in depth). Some have really loved ""Fallen"" and some have particularly disliked it. For certain groups, there may be something to dislike. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and have since seen it many times.

John Hobbes, (Washington), chasing a demonic serial killer is a great premise for a movie's plot, and something that has loads of potential to explore related themes. The movie does not scare you silly in the sense of making you jump with shock, (though in one place it does), but it more gives you a sense of forboding about what it is suggesting as possible: demons playing games with people and killing for fun. In this case, Azazel is the singing ""bad guy"" with an amazingly limited range of songs for someone over 10,000 years old, and is just having fun.

Thought-provoking movies really are enjoyable, and this one certainly gives one a bit to think about. The only thing that I would have added to the movie, for which it had the potential, is more of the ""shock"" element. However, that is merely a personal taste, and certainly nothing to detract from the plot, the movie or the wonderful acting of the stars and cast.

There are little clues throughout the movie, but not too many to give the game away to the viewer.

As a supernatural thriller, ""Fallen"" is a fantastic story that is well told. If you are looking for something that will make you jump, sadly ""Fallen"" won't do that much. If you are just looking for a very disturbing and tense story with a twist, then ""Fallen"" is your thing. I loved it, simply put.",1116028800,2,1684,4.566225165562914
33256,5,0780622537,"This film took me by surprised.  It didn't receive the greatest reviews and seemed to have come and gone pretty quickly at the theaters but this turned out to be a very well-made, stylish, and chilling film.  The always good Denzel Washington plays Detective John Hobbes.  Hobbes apprehends a serial killer named Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) and attends his eventual execution.  Not long after, a new series of murders begins with the same M.O. as Reese's.

Hobbes gets on the trail of this new killer and comes into contact with a theology professor Gretta Milano whose father was a homicide detective and committed suicide some thirty years ago.  This all leads into a lot of religious clues and signs regarding a demon named Azreal who roams the world without a form of his own and can take over any body by touch.  Needless to say with a demon inhabiting the body of anyone it wants, committing murder and then moving on, it soon becomes a nightmare of an investigation for Hobbes and his partner Jonesy, played by John Goodman.  Director Gregory Hoblit really does a great job in keeping this film fast-paced and the viewers guessing.  There's a great sequence where Azrael is literally jumping from body to body, at once avoiding Hobbes but also taunting him and daring Hobbes to cacth him.

The Film is a good thiller mixed with elements of horror that work very well together.  Washington is fantastic as the unrelenting Hobbes who may be in over his head.  Joining the cast is the always fun to watch Donald Sutherland as police Lt. Stanton and James Gandolfini.  It's a sylishly filmed movie and even a bit haunting with its climax and surprise twist ending, bolstered by a great soundtrack.  While not loaded with extras the DVD does provide a very good commentary by the director and screenwriter.

There are some minor problems with logic in the plot but nothing to make the movie fall apart.  Quite and enjoyable and underrated thriller.",1112227200,7,1949,4.773134328358209
33257,5,0780622537,"Definitely a good movie, Fallen, brings to the screen the story of a police officer who realizes that the serial killer that he has arrested and whose execution he has overseen was actually possessed by an ancient Mesopotamian spirit named Azazel.  Things become more complicated when the demon begins taking over body after body in an effort to have him framed and ultimately destroyed...

There are slight hints of Constantine, and strong/obvious elements from the X-Files.

The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.

Needless to say, Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!

33258,2,0780622537,"A friend of mine counts this as one of her favorite films, raving about its brilliance, twists and turns, and of course, the necessity that I see it. I never saw quite the value she saw in it. Certainly it was gripping, suspenseful and showcased typically good performances from Denzel Washington (as John Hobbes) and John Goodman (as Hobbes's partner Jonesy). Elias Koteas also turns in a great performance as a serial killer as he is about to be executed, who rants crazily in some unknown language and lays the groundwork in doing so for Hobbes's later theory that a demon was responsible for murders, traveling from one person's body to another. While the story had all the elements of a good thriller, I perhaps was in too giddy a mood to take the story seriously, fixating instead on the robe worn nearly constantly by Hobbes's brother Art. In nearly every scene where Art appears, I would yell out, ""Is Art's robe in this scene?"" thereby effectively ruining some otherwise intense scenes. Yes, it was juvenile and has nothing to do with the merits of the film. Overall the plot delves deeply into supernatural territory, which will not be terribly satisfying to everyone, including me. My interest was lost along with what appeared to be the last bit of footing the plot had.",1111881600,,1282,4.753363228699552
33259,2,0780622537,"I am a fan of Denzel Washington, and I think John Goodman is a very good actor, but this movie did not live up to the expectations. The main reason is that the plot just unravels even before halfway, it simply is not believable in any sense. And the final was a letdown and a vain attempt to be even creepier than the movie. I don't particularly have a problem with supernatural thrillers, but this one just doesn't make the cut. No matter how good the actors are and the acting is, when the material you work with is bad, there is not much you can do.",1108252800,,552,4.168224299065421
33260,2,0780622537,"A stylish and suspensful film with a great premise. THE FALLEN is a pretty good mystery, supernatural, suspense thriller. It's ALL THAT up to the last 5-to-10 minutes. However, the bottom falls out at the climax and it leaves the audience either confused, empty, angry or all of the above (while the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" plays in the background of the closing credits).  An evil entity transfers to different human hosts through physical contact, takes over their body, and goes on a killing spree leading the authorities to believe that there is a serial killer or copy-cat killer on the loose.  Denzel Washington as Detective John Hobbes figures out what is going on through riveting police work and must suspend all doubts of the supernatural to prepare a plan to fight the evil presence.  What happens in the end destroys the story and the credibility of the lead character (Washington) as the evil entity is allowed to escape (a la Hannibal Lecter in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - -perhaps the producers thought they could get a sequel out of it). The open-end conclusion is what hurts the film.

With the help of a sharp linguist (the astonishingly beautiful and talented Embeth Davison) Hobbes discovers that evil doesn't truly die but constantly gets ""reborn"".

An effective thriller director by Gregory Hoblit (""Primal Fear""), ""Fallen"" does occasionally stretch credibility but, on the whole, it's a gripping and powerful thriller along the lines of ""Angel Heart"". Mixing elements of ""The Exorcist"" and """"The Silence of the Lambs"", ""Fallen"" features a sharp performance by Denzel Washington and a strong supporting cast including John Goodman as Hobbes disbelieving partner. Hoblit's direction manages to gloss over some of the cracks in Nicholas Kazan's imaginative screenplay. The incredible craft of the film makes you realize how inept recent thrillers have been.

The video quality is very solid although some of the darker sequences do suffer a bit in this DVD transfer. Overall, the image quality is stellar. The audio has very nice presence with the dialogue coming through with clarity and crispness. It's evident that this hasn't been remastered for its re-release. It looks very consistent with the previous edition released to DVD.

Although it doesn't any extras, there's a very good commentary track. Featuring director Hoblit, writer Kazan and producer Charles Roven focuses more on the performances, how he tried to bring credibility to the more incredible elements of the screenplay and what was changed along the way from conception to production.

If you're looking for a solid, creepy movie to watch this Halloween (though this one isn't appropriate for the kids.

33287,5,0780622537,"Simply put, ""Fallen"" is a pure classic in the psychological thriller genre!  Very few films in this genre that attempt such status actually ever achieve as successfully as this film does.  From the very beginning of this film to the end it is an intense, script and character driven silver screen masterpiece.  One of the most interesting aspects of this film is that it can be watched over and over again, given time in between viewings, and one can pick up different things every time, making it that much better.
Performance wise, Denzel Washington delivers one of his most powerful and memorable performances in this fine film.  Of course, over the years he's proven himself to be one of Hollywood's finest in that very few films of his are less than spectacular.  This particular role for him almost engenders the aura that it was specifically written with him in mind as the lead.  John Goodman's performance is right on par with his usual style of acting, making the film that much better.  Donald Sutherland's performances over the years have been, to me, somewhat spotty with his performance in this film being one of his better ones.  The only other film that I've watched in which Embeth Davidtz, and incredibly beautiful actress, has starred in was ""Schindler's List.""  Her performance in ""Fallen"" is extremely memorable, leaving one to the conclusion that they should check out her other films.  Of special note is seeing a pre ""Sopranos"" performance by James Gandolfini.
It's official, I'm a fan of Director Gregory Hoblit's films as he's not only deftly directed this fine film but other enjoyable films such as ""Frequency"" and ""Hart's War.""  Granted, he benefited greatly from the superior script of ""Fallen,"" it's the style in which he portrayed this film that makes it such a powerful, edge of your seat film.
The Premise:
Denzel Washington plays homicide detective John Hobbes.  Shortly after watching the execution of Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas), many of the same things that were happening to Detective Hobbes prior to capturing Reese start happening again but wait a minute, it was Reese that was doing these things before but that's impossible because he was executed.
What follows from there is one of the most intense and powerful psychological thriller to ever grace the silver screen as detective Hobbes starts to learn just exactly who or what he's dealing with...
The only true surprise in this film is that it didn't really gain overwhelming critical support when it was in the theaters.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films in this genre as it can only be described as tops in the genre.  {ssintrepid}

Well, Director Gregory Hoblit created an atmosphere that was not only weird, but incredibly compelling. Don't blink for a minute. (Hoblit later made the wonderful ""Primal Fear"") Denzel is his usual confident self, learning, along with the viewer, the strange develoments. Embeth Davitz is quite fine, and there's also the talents of James Gandolfini and John Goodman. Once again, Donald Sutherland gives a brilliant performance. (Why do the Oscars ignore him...?). Elias Koteas, sadly ignored by critics and award committees, is again flawless. (Remember ""Some Kind of Wonderful"", ""Apt Pupil"", ""The Thin Red Line"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", etc. ?)

 But this is where it get's creepy, his soul escapes his body, and transfer's to a guard who released the gas. See Edgar Reese killed his victims, but he was controlled by a demon, and Edgar was not in his right space of mind, he was used like a puppet.

33293,3,0780622537,"As a suspenseful mystery, FALLEN is a great movie (though if you are observant the movie's twist is revealed in its opening scene). However, the last act nullifies the movie's good moments.

The entire premise of the movie is totally un-Biblical and anytime a film uses a Biblical concept (demons) then totally twists it around without regard to the source, it is diminished in my eyes. Also, the movie is a wicked movie, wicked in the sense of its overpowering evil and the fact that there is no catharsis. Movies like that just aren't very entertaining to watch.

Nevertheless, there are a couple of reasons to watch FALLEN. First, there is Denzel Washington; he's just a fascinating actor to watch perform. However, the main reason to watch this film are because of its supporting actors: John Goodman and Donald Sutherland. They outshine Washington in almost every scene.

If you enjoyed THE EXORCIST, you may like this movie. It's also worth watching if you're a Washington or Goodman or Donald Sutherland fan. Other than that, I'd reccommend watching something that leaves your emotions purged instead of pent up.",1051747200,,1119,4.973262032085562

Denzel Washington does a really good job as the homicide detective Hobbes being chased by the fallen angel Azazel. Excellent support is provided by John Goodman as his partner. The film is genuinely creepy in places and Azazel's transference from person to person produces some really good scenes.

33307,1,0780622537,"Hey, I've got a great idea! How about, you go back and watch the Twin Peaks series, and then after watching that series, you completely rip it off and make a movie you claim as a ""original"". Fallen has fallen into the plagarism trap and tries to pass itself off as being it's own. If you go back and watch the Twin Peaks series you will find that Fallen is nothing more than an inferior [imitation] of perhaps the greatest television show of all time.
From the general plotline all the way down to the details, the cat at the end of Fallen is a complete [copy-cat] of the owls in Twin Peaks. Go back, watch it, it's all there.
Fallen has the cabin in the mountains much like the rural setting to Twin Peaks and even the last shot of the movie is a verbatum replay of the exact same shot at the end of Episode 16 of Twin Peaks.
Trying not to give too much of either away both revolve around ""carriers"" going after the main character, who is in both, you guessed it, just happened to be police officers.
The one difference is the poor quality of this Twin Peaks remake. It is nothing more than a b-rated [imitation] with A-list actors going along for the ride.
Both main characters even sang for crying out loud! Twin Peaks must be rolling over in it's grave right now thanks to this harsh injustice it has been served.

33308,3,0780622537,"The script of this film is fantastic. It begins in the classic 3 act structure whereby act 1 introduces you to the story. We start off with Denzel running in the snow and his internal thoughts being translated to us through voice over. He carefully states that he is in a near death experience, but because of the style of the genre that we have become used to, we assume that Denzel is going to die.
Act 2 takes us back into the life of Denzel prior to the moment when we engage with him at the beginning of the film. He works alongside his colleague, John Goodman, in a police station, and they are both eventually possessed by an evil spirit, or more rightly termed, a fallen angel. John Goodman becomes the antagonist possessed with the fallen angel, out to take possession of Denzel. Denzel is forced to impose a slow death on Goodman in the middle of nowhere, and takes a lethal nicotine injection so that when the spirit leaves Goodman and enters inside of him, he is already dead, thus putting an end to the travels of the fallen angel. Once the spirit realises this and enters inside of Denzel, we see Denzel running in the snow as at the beginning of the film.
Then, Act 3 kicks in. We still have in our minds that Denzel is about to die. And he does. But the internalisations that we hear are not the words of Denzel, but the fallen angel. The fallen angel manages to live on beyond Denzel's death by entering inside a white wolf, thereby double crossing the audience through the use of drama synchronised with a familiar voice. A very clever piece of writing.",1003190400,,1571,4.4206896551724135
33309,4,0780622537,"If you are with the opinion that The Bone Collector, also starring Denzel Washington, sucked because the ""clues"" left by the killer on purpose to make fun of the cops was way too exaggerated and it had a very lame ending, this is what you need to watch because this one is dealing with that both cases near perfect. Everything is just fine in this movie; cast, plot, direction, music, ect. The story will keep you nailed to your seat from the very beginning to the ending credits. And Rolling Stones will keep you watching the ending credits. The atmosphere is dark and mysterious, although it would be better if the writer didn't feel it necessery to reveal in the very beginning that the killer is in fact a body shifthing evil soul. Music is excellent, you can't help but get drawn into the movie with that music playing in the background. And it was so nice to see Elias Koteas in his role, someone i really admire for his Han Solo part in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But that's not the only suprise in the movie, it has its exceptional ending. I strongly disagree with the idea that ending was anywhere near predictable. I hate to give away clues about a film's ending, but my title already does. About the DVD, it has not much but some cool features. Like, it has the best feature for me, both full screen and wide screen formats. And then we have a running commentary, trailer, cast & crew and similar stuff. The picture transfer of the film deserves credit and apperiance is ok, too. So this film is a buy.

33310,4,0780622537,"This was a terrific film that spends the first half being a mystery and the second half in gripping suspense. I thought the blending was unique and satisfying. The only problem with this picture is that the first second of any given commercial for it or the first few lines of any review of it give away the entire mystery so that the first half of the film could turn quite boring as you wait for something unexpected to happen. IF you do not know the plot (or can pretend you don't!) the first half is really intriguing, leading up to a powerful sequence revealing what is going on and then speeding and chilling at a nice pace towards an amazing ending. The film borders on horror without being a gore fest.
Chief merit of this film, which bump it up to the four stars for me: Films dealing with supernatural villainy tend to become stupid when they don't respect the power of the villain. There is nothing wrong with creating a monster that is unrealistic or unusual, just there must be some sense of rules to how he functions. See that AWFUL mummy movie that they have now even, shamelessly, sequeled, for a perfect example of what not to do: make a monster in theory very scary for its power and then make him extremely unscary in practice when you realize that he can be stopped by tying his shoe laces together so he trips when he tries to chase you. The superficial conquering of or escaping from a creature of great power reveals his power to have been not anything worth being scared of. A power is not made scary as a promise but by a practice.
SO, this film for making its villainy frightening and the resolution of the film one which depends on the particularities of the powers the film is about so that the ending result for the monster is fitting to its nature and not simply a dumb way to try an end a movie that started with a good but impractical (or impractically conceived) super-villainy and didn't bother to consider the ending when starting.
In honor of this film's use of intriguing character rules that set limits on how the evil can be destroyed and how it cannot (tying shoe laces together not being among the options), and its resolution in accordance with those rules, and in honor of a nicely frightening experience, I hereby bestow upon ""Fallen"" four Amazon.com stars.

33313,5,0780622537,"This film is a mix of influences. They say it has to do with  Seven . Yes, if we consider we are inside the police, if we consider one young cop is the targeted victim of the  criminal . They say it has to do with the  Exorcist . Yes if we consider the  criminal  is an evil spirit, a fallen angel who is roaming the streets and taking possession of various bodies to achieve his destructive plan. But it could also be connected to the beautiful book by Anne Rice,  The Servant of the Bones , since it has to do with very old semitic, or even pre-semitic myths. But in fact it is a film of its own, and it cannot be reduced to these references. This evil and fallen angel, Azazel, is playing in society by targeting a cop and pushing him into destroying himself, which is the only possibility this cop has to destroy, or try to destroy this evil fallen angel. The suspense of the film is close to panic, for the targeted cop, but also for us, because we can only follow the evil spirit jumping from one body to another in a crowd through the looks, attitudes and musical references to an old songs of the sixties that moves along with the spirit from one body to the next, leaving no memory in the seized bodies after the spirit has left them, but also leaving a trail of tears and blood behind him, because he kills along the way. It is an absolutely and completely trapped situation in which the targeted cop can only try to play and trap the evil and fallen angel in his turn, but in which he will necessarily lose because there is no escape, and this spirit cheats. The only moral of the film, and we get it straight away, is that the death penalty for one of the possessed bodies turned criminal is totally useless, because the spirit is an alien in the body and cannot be killed by the death of the body. He will escape and he will go on haunting and possessing other bodies. I will not give away the trick he has to use when he is trapped, but this trick is an allusion to a famous film adapted from Stephen King and dealing with a haunted pet. There is no exorcism or exorcising of this spirit because there is no way of destroying the spirit. Even God cannot destroy it. God could only reject it down into humanity. Once created an angel, that angel, even fallen, cannot be destroyed by God. God is not almighty, and he can only clean up his realm by getting rid of the rotten apples in his basket by out-casting them down onto humanity that is going to be plagued by them, on God's decision, a decision that is the result of God's mistake and impotence to straighten up his own mistakes. This film is unswervingly pessimistic. Even God is trapped by his mistakes in his creative work and God's mistakes are man's doomed lot. Beautiful.

It appears that the basic plot is simply copied from Stephen Gallagher's excellent novel ""The Valley of Lights"", with some things taken from Wes Craven's movie ""Shocker"" (which, as a child, I placed among my favorite horrors :). Keep this in mind while watching ""Fallen"".

33315,2,0780622537,"...A brilliant idea was left to rot.

John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) is the capturer of a serial killer, Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, in the film's best role), who is sent to his  death laughing and singing and promising that he'd be back. While some  discrepancies between Reese and the evidence in the murders he committed  nags at Hobbes, a riddle Reese asked him shortly before the execution turns  up the suicide of a polieman thirty years ago and entangles Hobbes in the  web that binds these two cases together with thousands of years of history  and the supernatural.

Yeah, it's a great premise. Too bad it's given  such short shrift in here. Every aspect of this film was done better in  Seven, despite the difference in their mechanations (the killer in Fallen  really IS supernatural), and held up against its predecessor, Fallen leaves  a whole lot to be desired.",961286400,,875,4.798657718120805

33321,5,0780622537,"Fallen is underrated, as I felt it wasn't nowhere near as bad as some critics said it to be.  It's a very interesting mix of The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lambs and Seven.  The result is one of the best thrillers of  the decade.  It's not quite up there with Lambs or Seven but it's as good  as Arlington Road and is significantly superior to The Bone Collector and  Kiss the Girls.
The plot is about Detective John Hobbes (Denzel  Washington), who has just captured serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias  Koteas).  Before Reese is executed, he speaks to Hobbes in a strange  language and tells him a riddle, asking him why there's a space between  Lyons and Spakowsky.  Hobbes doesn't think much of this and watches  silently as Reese is executed in the gas chamber.
The next day, another  murder occurs, and Hobbes and his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) check it  out.  To his shock, Hobbes finds the same riddle Reese told him scrawled on  the wall of the victim's apartment.  Unraveling the clue and with the help  of an intelligent woman named Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz), he discovers  that a demon called Azazel had inhibited the body of Reese and can switch  from one human host another with a simple touch.
The premise itself is  chilling, yet I was a bit hesitant to watch this film.  The critics'  reviews were mixed but all of them seemed to agree that the film was a bit  slow moving.  The truth is, Fallen is a bit slow for the first forty or so  minutes, but the last eighty minutes are full of intriguing ideas that are  well explored along with plenty of extremely suspenseful scenes, especially  the ending, which, by the way, has a great twist.
Regarding the  suspenseful moments of the film, they can truly be described as edge of  your seat.  One of the most harrowing sequences in this film is an original  chase scene that involves the domino effect, where the demon chases after  Davidtz by passing from one human host to another.  There's also the  chilling scenes where Washington has to try and keep up with who Azazel has  just possessed.
Fallen's greatest aspect, despite all those truly  thrilling and very suspenseful scenes, is its ending.  It first involves a  very clever plan being unfolded by one of the characters and ends with a  great and unpredictable plot twist.  This is truly one of the most  unpredictable endings I have seen.  It might not have as much of the shock  power as the edgy (and twisty) climaxes of Seven and Arlington Road (or for  that matter, The Sixth Sense), but it's just as surprising if not  more.
The performances in this film are solid.  Denzel Washington is fine  as the detective who is much more clever than Azazel thinks.  John Goodman  is his usual solid self as Hobbes' partner, and he excels in this role,  proving he has a lot of range ever since his show Roseanne was cancelled.  Embeth Davidtz's performance is okay though her character is slightly  underwritten.  The real scene stealer, though, is Elias Koteas.  Though  he's in the film for five minutes his Edgar Reese character is scary and  actually a bit fun to watch.  Most of the characters are well-developed and  this helps us care for Hobbes and his family.
The script by Nicholas  Kazan is well-written and the twist in the end makes it better to  appreciate and Gregory Hoblit's use of a dark,  edgy atmosphere and mood is  undeniably effective.",948672000,87,3388,4.626057529610829

If it had been nurtured, steered towards hard-core horror and treated with respect by its handlers, 'Fallen' could have been a good, lower-profile  hit. But it was butchered, seemingly just for the sake of introducing a new  generation of filmgoers to the occult thriller vein. Washington is passable  in the lead role but Goodman is abysmally mismatched in this picture.  There's way too much of Hollywood's 'big boom' explosion feel here which  likewise raises eyelids with lighting rather than fear. The pace is  questionable - the film takes far far too long to even try and start to  move. What's worst of all is that there's a total tongue-in-cheekness taken  by the director to the occult subjet matter. With the demons of old, you  were warned not to mess around with the occult through sheer fear. Here,  there's too much violence and too little satanic overtone. While this movie  was supposed to have warned you about the consequences of living in a world  of demonic possession, instead it serves as a warning for you not to pick  it up for anything more than a rental.
