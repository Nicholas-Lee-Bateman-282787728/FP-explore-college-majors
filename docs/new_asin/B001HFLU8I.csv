3630358,5,B001HFLU8I,"I've been watching these movies over and over for years now.  I became addicted after a single purchase of just one of the movies and was amazed at how true it was to Scripture.  I've since acquired every one of them and have never tired of any of them.  It was amazing to see Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, come to life and learn his history on the big screen.  It was exciting to see the entire story of the meek Moses (unlike Charlton Heston's character) from his birth to his death.  The story of Joseph is awe inspiring and the perfect example of how God can use evil deeds against us to reveal a Divine purpose.  And then there is David.  His story includes his early challenges as he cared for the king who was trying to kill him, his successful plot to murder the husband of his mistress, countless trials with his children by different women, and all the way to his death.

I won't elaborate on the rest of them but can say they're ALL worth the watch.",1363564800,3,972,4.273224043715847
3630359,5,B001HFLU8I,"This is a well put together series and uplifting, the stories were captured and retold with a great deal of clairity and meaning which is always hard to acomplish with biblcal stories, with the short amount of time alloted in a movie and still keep the attention of the viewer as well great series.",1363305600,3,298,4.537037037037037

3630366,5,B001HFLU8I,"In the late 80's and 90's Turner Network Television produced some very high quality mini-series and movies, including this series of Bible story movies.  All are well done, with good scripts and top tier actors, and most do a realatively good job with the Biblical subject.  This product includes all the movies produced (as far as I know) and is actually two different sets combined (one box set with individual movie cases, and one box set with the multiple DVD's in one case) to make the complete set.

For fans of Bible related movies and media this is a must-have set and I highly recommend it! See each individual movie for a review of the movies themselves.",1304726400,51,664,4.6581196581196584

3630395,5,B001HFLU8I,"These are awesome, probably not approprirate until kids are around 14 or up. they really help to capture the life of the times of the bible, and most  importantly all you to watch the process it takes for every prophets, saint, mystic, safe to get to where they end up.

It also shows you the saints who surround them, who often remain unkown, but could not have been done without them.

Great movies. I'm trying to think . . . . awww , I found two. Genesis is pretty slow moving, and if approached properly kindof comical to the kids. A lot of movie cameras moving over barron land and not a lot of educational there. But everything else, truly, were exceptional . . . except maybe the book of Genesis- pretty hard book to get onto DVD. But the rest of them make those two duds totally, totally worth it. Very great for teenages to gain a greater understanding of theses stories of the bible and they are so well done, my kids wanted to see them. (Of course, my son still cracks jokes about Genesis, but that's actually funny and a bonding experience. It also brought up good conversation about the fact that this portrayl was likely not far off from reality forcing them to contemplate a time so different than our own.",1406592000,,1221,4.417777777777777

3630404,5,B001HFLU8I,I am thankful to have a background in Theology so I am comfortable with these Bible stories on DVD.  I can wholeheartedly share that these movies are approximately 95 to 97 percent true to life (depending upon which movie you are watching) according to the Word of God.  Sometimes Hollywood makes suttle changes for unknown reasons (to me) but the true meaning behind each movie can be seen and heard.

3630407,1,B001HFLU8I,"WARNING!!!

Though watching these movies may be entertaining, THEY HAVE INACCURACIES IN THEM. THESE ARE NOT GOOD SUBSTITUTES TO LEARNING THE TRUTH. The ONLY WAY to learn THE TRUTH IS TO READ ""THE HOLY BIBLE"" AND NOT ANY IMITATION OR ONE THAT HAS BEEN ALTERED!!! (Galatians 1:6-10) ""I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!  Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or, am I trying to please men? If I were trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.""",1383782400,5,988,4.335135135135135

Update dec/13
------------------------
- The Complains here expressed are mostly due to the misleading advertising.
This is not one set but two different sets (from different companies) with two different packaging qualities and dvd features.

- However, These movies are SUPERB, you need to have them around in your home to see them when needed.
All of these are Lube productions shot in Morocco with superb performance from many well known actors (however, they re-cast actors from one movie to the other, but you can get past it).

- These movies were shot in 35mm film with top quality optics but were intended for TV. All these DVD are ported from tapes! thus are noisy and suffer from a lot of artifacts, namely, interlacing artifacts and block and mosquito noise. The Mpeg-2 codec falls short in fast paced scenes like those containing river streams: The series needs urgently a proper Blu-ray port from the film not from the tapes. (For pc users, due to the less than stellar port, the dvds look better when played in Windows Media Center as opposed to let's say winDVD)

- In conclusion you have to have these Superb and Powerful productions! Still, mind your buying options.

-------------------------
Original Review:
-------------------------

First at all, I always dislike when I see negative reviews because I tend to think they are biased.

I have found out that there's no such thing as a 12 DVD bible movie set.

The first problem starts with the way the product is being advertised, it is showing 12 DVD covers all of them showing similar cover arts and thus you might expect similar quality across all the discs.
What you get, however, is actually 2 different ""Bible"" DVD sets, The First one is a 6 DVD set that is called ""The Bible Collection"" it is directly from Warner Brothers, The Second One is a 7 DVD set called ""The Bible Collection 7 DVD Set"" from two other distribution companies (trimark and sparrow).
So once again there's no 12 DVD set anymore and you don't receive that.

Following up with individual set review:

=======================
The Bible Collection Set
=======================

Rating: 5 Stars !

It includes:

- Abraham
- Jacob
- Joseph
- Moses
- David
- Samson & Delilah

Each production comes in a separate case with original cover art With the following features:

- English (stereo) and Spanish (mono) sound Languages
- English, French, Spanish subtitles

(I thought I was going to receive the 12 DVDs (or 13) in this quality.

==========================
The Bible Collection 7 DVD Set
==========================

Rating: 0 stars !!

and I'm saying 0 because of the misleading advertisement that made me think all the ""12 dvds"" belonged to a same set, real rating should be 3 stars.

It includes:

- Genesis (English sound / Spanish Subtitles)
- Solomon (English sound / no subtitles)
- Jeremiah (English sound / Spanish subtitles)
- Esther (English sound / Spanish subtitles)
- Jesus (English sound / no subtitles) --- this is supposed to be the bonus disc as advertised but it makes integral part of this 7 dvd set.
- Paul the Apostle (English sound / no subtitles)
- The Apocalypse (English sound / no subtitles)

+++ all these productions have been properly dubbed to Spanish and it is a waste you don't get it in these dvds, but no Subtitles is kind of out of the limit+++
This is a product from 2 studios called TriMark (subtitles) and Sparrow (not even subtitles)

* It comes all together in a single case; Inside of it there is this thing that holds 6 of the 7 dvds whilst the other one lies on the normal position, and it has the disadvantage that it makes it Hard to extract the dvds which favors accidental scratching.
* the dvd discs are not fashioned with the production's art, that is: the dvd discs are just printed with title and logos from studios.

=========
The price
=========

I paid a hundred dollars for this thinking it was the one dvd set containing all those productions with the alternative Spanish language (seriously any bible or Christianity dvd has to include Spanish language so as to enjoy the productions in the company of Spanish speakers; I can see the movies alone, but my relatives only get Spanish, and some of the DVDs don't even include subtitles!; and let's face it Spanish speaking people are amongst the people who are mostly interested into Christianity)

you can get this very same thing for 75 dollars or less by buying ""The Bible Collection set"" (brown cover) for 39 USD in amazon and the 7 dvd set for 30 - 40 USD

=========
Conclusion
=========

You don't get what is advertised.
you keep it because you can watch it alone but not in the company of Spanish speaking people.
Even if you're not looking for Spanish language you get subpar quality (discs, cases) in half of the discs you're buying and you can get cheaper by buying the 2 sets separately.

I'll see how to tell Amazon to force the removal of the misleading advertising (I'm filing a claim first but I think it goes straight to the seller, if anyone knows how to contact Amazon on this do let me know)",1365206400,52,5087,4.743473325766175

The 1st cd was about Jesus. I blew off the heredical part of Jesus & Mary (Lazuras' sister) having a thing for one another. But when it showed the part of John the Baptist saying he will baptize Jesus for the remission of His sins..I lost it. That disc is destroyed. Watching the rest, its grievous. It is SO unbiblical, it's discusting. I'll sell them to Macays bookstore, with the Jesus cd out. And I will put a note in there that they are NOT scripurally based.

8308791,3,B001HFLU8I,"Half the set is pretty good, and follows the biblical narrative pretty well.  Particularly the Old Testament.  But we only watched about 1/4 of the Jesus video before we got disgusted and pulled it out of the machine.  VERY unbiblical.  No surprise, as this one was made in Italy, by an Italian, and the actors were Italian.  The Church of Rome rules Italy.  Therefore this sad, inaccurate, heretical video was very catholic in it's heresy.  For anybody who actually knows the Bible, this video will make you angry.  Spoilers.  Jesus sins.  He rants at God his father for not raising up Joseph when he died as Jesus demanded..  Mary has to be the one to tell him when it's time to begin his ministry.  John the Baptist does not know who Jesus really is and states he will baptize Jesus IF Jesus confesses to his sins and repents.  Baptism is by sprinkling.  It was at that point we yanked it out of the player and trashed it.  the Bible says Jesus is the sinless lamb of God.  the Bible says that John the Baptist knew who Jesus was from the womb, and told the crowd that Jesus was the lamb of God.  For crying out loud, they were cousins, John lept in his mother's womb on hearing Mary's voice when carrying Jesus, and Elizabeth immediately knows that Mary is blessed above all women and carries Elizabeth's Lord in her womb.  That's bible.  What this is is Catholic heresy.  DO NOT give this thing to anybody seeking Christ and who does not know their bible.  It's virtually satanic in nature.",1492214400,17,1495,4.483271375464684
