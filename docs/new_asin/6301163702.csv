7809962,5,6301163702,"Hands down one of the best intros I've seen in a Horror film. The Lizzy Borden cover, or lip-sync, was fun and well performed. The singer really sold the 80's hair metal feel with his dancing and hand gestures. I actually found myself re watching that scene a few times in a row. I only wish the Black Roses performed in the same demon zombie looking make-up/masks throughout the film.

The film is about a metal band that rolls into town looking for a spot to play some shows. They found what I believe was the school auditorium, if I remember correctly,  and perform for the students. When the Black Roses play a show, they send out subliminal messages to the teens to kill and rebel against their parents, teachers, and anyone else against their music. Every show is pretty much a cult ritual that provokes the kids to kill afterwards.

This is in fact a cheeze fest with your typical 80's effects/sounds and that, my horror friends, is what makes it so great. This film has it all! Horror, good tunes, nudity, and some of the cheeziest kills you will ever see. A must for any Horror fan who is coincidentally also a metalhead, such as myself, and for anyone else into the 80s Horror Films. I recommend the VHS version with embossed artwork. The cover is nice and the video quality is perfect for these type of films.",1362787200,,1320,4.491666666666666

7809964,4,6301163702,"I don't know what it is about this movie.  Maybe it's because I am actually one of the few people to see it in the theatre when it first came out back in the Reagan years.  Maybe it's because I had an English teacher that looked like Mr. Moorhouse and there was a hottie in my class like Julie.  Maybe it's because I grew up in a quaint little town like Mill Basin.  I don't know, but I really like this movie and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of 80's hair bands or the 80's in general.  On to the review.

The movie starts with a really cool introduction as a band is performing the Lizzie Borden classic ""Me Against the World"" on stage.  The house lights come up and we see that it's not a band of humans but a literal band of demons!  The music kicks into high gear, the police try to shut the show down and a horde of evil demons breaks out of the arena and into the city outside.

Cut to Mill Basin, quiet little town somewhere in the USA.  Two lamborghinis prowl through the streets and out of them pop a group of sleazy looking heavy metal musicians.  One is played by Carmine Appice, drummer for King Kobra (and numerous other bands) in the real world.  One has a leopard-skin crotch piece.  I digress.  Anyway, they start putting up posters advertising a show by a guy named ""Damien.""  Evil, right?  Someone named Damien couldn't be an opening act for Amy Grant, could he?  Cut to Mr. Moorhouse's english class where, God bless him, he's trying to teach the Great Unwashed the high-points of Walt Whitman.  Anyway, the kids are not really paying attention and we get to see the dynamics of the realtionships in the movie: Julie, an attractive young woman, is Mr. Moorhouse's favorite and Johnny, a young punk, has a crush on Julie and dislikes Mr. Moorhouse.  Also, we hear rumblings about a rock group called ""Black Roses"" with a frontman named Damien who are, for some reason, kicking off their world tour at Mill Basin's tiny concert hall.  What could the purpose be?  You'll have to buy the tape to find out, but I'll give you some hints: it involves murder, demons, gratuitous nudity, the destruction of several Kenner Super Powers figures (seriously!), an appearance by ""Big P@ssy"" from The Sopranos and lots and lots of Heavy Metal, most performed by an all-star band recruited together just for this movie.

In short, Black Roses is a lot of fun and not the corny crap you might expect.  The movie rises above its limitations and is actually pretty darn good.  Watch it and you too will be chanting, ""Damien!  Damien!  Damien!""  Meanwhile, I'm chanting, ""Black Roses DVD!  Black Roses DVD!""",1182384000,,2619,4.479915433403805
7809965,5,6301163702,"Black Roses is the BEST 80's movie out there. I know it's not big bugget like Nightmare On Elm St etc, But the music make's up for that. And the effect's are not that bad, don't forget it's from the 80's. And if there's ever a remake, hopefuly by George  A. Romero, and of course, with the use of the same music, don't forgot, it will have came from this little masterpeace, so all you people that say it suck's can kiss my A**, your the type that would watch the movie JACKASS and say it's supurb.",1153612800,2,498,4.134020618556701
7809966,1,6301163702,"This is one of the most un-intentionally laugh-out-loud bad, Bad, BAD movies I've ever seen! The script is SO cheesy, as well as the acting and music.  It isn't scary at all! I also reccomend THE worst movie I've ever seen, ""Rock n' Roll Nightmare"" (1987), for people who love so-bad-it's funny movies!",1088640000,2,302,4.69811320754717
7809967,1,6301163702,"This movie is by no means worth 10 dollars new.  It is extremely rare but we at the LIMC have reviewed it and its quite boring.  Its alot of dialogue about a heavy metal band wanting to play a concert in a small town.  So the high school kids have a petition and the PTA is against it.  Finally, the concert is thrown and ONE person dies when he gets eaten by one of the loud speakers at the show.  The End.
A waste of time.
