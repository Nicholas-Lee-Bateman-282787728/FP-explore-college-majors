2793663,5,B000OCY7K8,"This show is one of the better talk shows I've ever seen, mostly because of the guests Rollins gets to come on- Bill Maher, Ozzy Osbourne, Kevin Smith, Paul Thomas Anderson, for example- and the fact that they're actually talking about real issues and aren't censored (this is also a bonus for the musical acts), instead of telling an anecdote or two.  The musical guests are also great- Jurassic 5, Damian Marley, and Ben Folds are among my favorites from Season 1.

Overall, Rollins makes a great show- interestings guests, great music, and his bits are consistently very funny.",1212537600,2,580,4.848484848484849
2793664,5,B000OCY7K8,"Maybe it's because I subscribe to a Rupert Murdoch owned pay tv enterprise but as far as material like that which you see on Rollins show goes I am definitely NOT spoilt for choice, if however I wanted to hear people rant about the dangers of iran, china, terror at my doorstep etc then I have plenty to keep me going, so that's the first reason I like this show. Secondly Rollins promised that on this show he would be talking about important subject matter which he does and when interviewing celebrities promises that he will not discuss their love life, private affairs and other banalities which seem to be the order of the day, and again he delivers on that promise, and what's more the interviewees seem to be quite enthusiastic about this, leading to some enjoyable discourse, so if the idea of that makes you yawn because you've seen it all before then fair enough, but for me this material is not prevelant on my TV and so as someone who has watched Bush and co with a sense of foreboding I am grateful to Rollins for reminding me the other side of the coin hasn't been extinguished.",1188864000,5,1093,4.47
2793665,3,B000OCY7K8,"He opens with a rant about how his show is going against the grain and then proceeds to stick as closely as possible to the talk show template. Interviews are made up of typical talk show non-questions, the goal being just to get the guest to blather vaguely about something so you have something to air. I hoped and even expected to learn something about the guests. In most cases I didn't. The interviews with both Oliver Stone and Patton Oswalt consist of Rollins and his guest giving each other paranoid anti-bush reacharounds without saying anything substancial, and there are substancial things that could have been said about the topic. His railing against SUVs and other typical left-wing targets sounds like a broken record most of the time, with impassioned vocal delivery, inflammatory adjectives and vilifying nouns standing in for insight and logic. It should also be noted that the majority (possibly all) of the musical acts on this show are either on a major label or on a so-called indie label with a so-called ""distribution deal"" with a major. Way to support the underground scene Henry. I don't mean to be so negative, I mean I did watch the whole thing, even resisted hitting the fast-forward button during P.T. Anderson's sleep-inducing interview, and the skits or whatever that are just Rollins talking to the camera are mostly totally funny, but this show could have been a lot cooler and has lowered my opinion of Rollins.",1182297600,10,1446,4.882113821138211
2793666,4,B000OCY7K8,"Rollins' show is a thoroughly engrossing mix of no-audience one-on-one interviews where the interviewer actually listens to his guests and holds a genuine discussion with them, along with sharp, no-holds-barred commentary pieces from Henry himself.

And then, there are great musical performances from artists you would rarely see on the usual late night talk shows, and it's the musical part where I give this DVD a huge star-off deduction. Pretty much every musical act does two numbers, but Rollins informs the viewers that the second number can only be viewed on the website. Sorry, I like to enjoy musical performances on my big-screen TV and multi-speaker audio system, not sitting in my office watching them on my computer, and it's mind-boggling--especially in light of Rollins being a musician himself--that this obvious extra of putting both songs on the DVD so fans could at least buy them and enjoy each artist's pair of songs together wasn't done. Instead, we get the straight show as it aired.

Great show; frustrating missed opportunity. How about it next season, guys? Either put both songs together in the show, put the second number after the credits or gather them all in a bonus features section, but please! And maybe even include the missed songs from this first season as extras as well so we can finally enjoy them in DVD quality...",1182124800,39,1356,4.995575221238938

8184418,5,B000OCY7K8,"What a shame HR TV wasn't around for very long. A great format & excellent interviews (well most of them anyway). Saw some new bands & just soaked up that Rollins goodness. Having been a fan for over 20 years, I gobbled up this DVD content & wish the second season was easier to find. Anyhoo, highly recommended for HR fans & purveyors of quality anywhere. Rollins has a unique style which works really well for most interviewees, even the train wrecks (Kev Smith & Eddie Izzard) are humorous. With such a prolific generator of content & supporter of quality literature, music & film, we should all aspire to the contrbution HR has made to our culture. Love you Hank :-)",1317945600,,670,4.545454545454546
8184419,2,B000OCY7K8,"My title really says it all.  Rollins has strong opinions but apparently he didn't use any reason and logic to come to them.

I agree with many of the ultimate conclusions that Rollins has so I'm not complaining because I don't like his point of view.  It's just that you aren't going to learn anything by watching the show other than maybe how to raise your voice and look angry.",1279756800,2,380,4.4
