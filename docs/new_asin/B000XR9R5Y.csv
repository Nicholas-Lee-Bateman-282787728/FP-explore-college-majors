3005327,5,B000XR9R5Y,"Fast Girl has something for everyone from action to drama to romance to suspense.  It is a wholesome movie that all members of the family can enjoy.  Mircea Monroe and Justin Guarini have great chemistry as Alex, the ""Fast Girl"" and her love interest, Darryl.  Dwier Brown and Caroline Rhea provide support as Uncle Bill and Maddie.  This is an inspiring movie with a solid message.  I highly recommend it as a great way to spend an evening with family.",1202083200,2,453,4.6125
3005328,5,B000XR9R5Y,"Fast Girl is a fun and heart-felt family film that also offers the excitement of auto racing. Beautifully shot and directed, and with a surprisingly solid performance by Justin Guarini (first year American Idol runner-up). I'm a car buff and this movie has lots of great racing footage, too. Well written with characters we all felt for, and a good message.

My wife and I enjoyed it just as much as our kids.",1201478400,4,409,4.602739726027397

8229256,5,B000XR9R5Y,"I recently watched this movie and was so pleasantly surprised!  The acting was great, and the filming (especially the race scenes) was fantastic.  Justin Guarini was REALLY good (and quite adorable).  Alex's struggle to follow her dreams was very moving, and I found myself teary more than once watching her struggle.  There was great suspense, and I really cared about these characters.  It was the kind of movie that left me smiling, and wanting more.  Great family film!",1204502400,2,473,5.0
8229257,5,B000XR9R5Y,"This was the perfect ""Movie Night"" movie. I watched with my 7 yr-old and a 9 yr-old nieces and we all loved it. It's not easy to find a movie that we can all watch together and enjoy. Fast Girl is a sweet, fun movie. The lead actress, Mircea Monroe, is fantastic. She is sure to be a big star. And I have to say it was fun to see Justin Guarini on the screen. The American Idol runner-up can really act. There is a lot of heart in this movie! (Also some really cool cars.)",1204243200,3,472,3.9270833333333335
8229258,5,B000XR9R5Y,"This was a great family movie. After having grown up around the race track that her uncle owns... a young woman desires to become a race car driver like her dad had been. The race car circuit drivers roll into town and romance is in the air.
A really sweet storyline and great acting by all involved. It was really nice to see Justin Guarini of American Idol fame step away from the mic to exercise his acting chops...which are really good. Mircea Monroe plays the female lead and is really good...as is Caroline Rhea in her role as the waitress at the local diner.",1203811200,3,565,4.390476190476191
8229259,5,B000XR9R5Y,"This film is an insider's secret--thrills and romance, with subtle touches that make watching a real treat. Beautifully shot and lit--catch the sunlight in the early morning scenes, which could be from an art film. Fun to watch throughout, and not just in the edge-of-your-seat racing parts. When was the last time you could see a movie with the whole family and have everyone smiling at the end? (I am a woman who knows nothing about cars.)",1203120000,3,441,4.740259740259741
8229260,4,B000XR9R5Y,"Fast Girl centers on the world of professional racing as conducted at local tracks all over America, and features an actual formula one racing team that races the west coast circuit. This angle is what differentiates the movie, because the basic plot line (girl has dream, adult stands in way of dream, girl meets guy who urges her to follow her dream, girl has to beat out rival) is pretty standard issue. The inclusion of the racing scenes is a clever move by the filmmakers, because it makes Fast Girl a romantic drama that boys as well as girls will want to watch.

Mircea Monroe (Drive) does a good job of portraying the rebellious young woman who has ""racing in her blood."" Dwier Brown (Field of Dreams) convincingly delivers the role of Uncle Bill, the adult who stands in her way. Justin Guarini (American Idol) proves he can act with the throw-away love interest role, although one has to question the filmmakers' decision to hide his natural curls under what is obviously a straight wig.

At times, the staging is a bit awkward, as is some of the dialog. This can largely be attributed to the fact the filmmakers probably shot the entire movie in the length of time that a big studio production takes to film a single scene. Small matter, however, because ultimately, the race cars are the star of this show.

Lacking a big special effects budget, the film uses its resources well. The track scenes have a realism that a glitzy production cannot provide. The director sets up and ultimately captures the split-second decisions Monroe's character has to make in the final racing scene, which determines whether she achieves her dream of becoming a professional race car driver.

The movie contains a couple of brief kissing scenes but otherwise no sex, bad language, or violence. Set your expectations for a pleasant movie that you can watch with your kids and not have to explain anything other than why there are no doors on formula one racecars.",1202169600,6,1957,4.747058823529412
