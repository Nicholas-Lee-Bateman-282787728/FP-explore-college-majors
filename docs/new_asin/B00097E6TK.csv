It's worth noting that Charles Bronson's character did a great job of not being needy. He let the nymphet take their relationship to the next level. For example, it was her idea to get married. He even used reverse psychology by saying, ""It wouldn't last six months.""",1378339200,,824,6.490909090909091

After two previous films and a lengthy career directing episodes of such TV classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GILLIGAN-S-ISLAND/dp/B000X07QSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GILLIGAN'S ISLAND</a>&nbsp;and THE BANANA SPLITS, Richard Donner here helmed a top-flight cast in one of his now most forgotten works.

In an Italian production filmed in Scotland, London and NYC, Bronson is a middle-aged American adult novelist romanced by a London teenager, a relationship that eventually brings them to the altar. Thus, after they got married in a fever, the fire went out and they've been talkin' 'bout Jackson.

Here, the child-woman seduces the writer against his and her parents' better judgment. They wed, move to New York and soon the reality of two very different lives hits home. In an ironic twist, despite reservations about how a divorce might unbalance his young wife, SHE'S the one with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leavin-on-her-Mind/dp/B0002B163W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leavin' on (her) Mind</a>"" (OK, no more song references!).

Leg men will love the many mini-skirts on display here, but as romantic comedies go this curio is very slight. (Watch for airport cameo from Mrs. Bronson, Jill Ireland.)
