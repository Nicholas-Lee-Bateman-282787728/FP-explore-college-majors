1036030,5,6305459592,"FRANK SINATRA IN ROYAL FESTIVAL HALL IS WONDERFUL. HES OLDER,THEREFORE MORE MELLOW AND COMFORTABLE WITH HIMSELF. TO ME, HIS SINGING AND STAGE PERSONNA ARE EXCELLENT!  HE IS SO SEXY MORE THAN EVER.  LAUGHING AND JOKING. AND WHEN HE FORGETS THOSE LINES OR ACTS LIKE HE DOES (THIS MAY BE PART OF THE ACT)HE COMES ACROSS AS SO HUMAN AND FUNNY.  MY FAVORITE IS ""I GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU VERY WELL""  THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND WELL PERFORMED IVE EVER EXPERIENCED.  HE WAS TRULY A GENIUS AT PERFORMING. ANOTHER WONDERFUL ONE WAS ""I WILL DRINK THE WINE"" THIS SONG WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GOOD IF NOT PERFORMED BY THIS MAN BUT IT JUST FIT HIM.  I LOVED IT! I DONT KNOW ABOUT ANYONE ELSE BUT THIS GUY STILL GETS ""UNDER MY SKIN"".  AND THAT PRINCESS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND HER SPEECH JUST  TAKES YOU TO FAIRY-TALE LAND SO TO SPEAK.  SINCE MOST OF US DONT RUB ARMS WITH ROYALTY.  SHE WAS WONDERFUL TOO!! YOU MUST GET THIS IF YOU ARE A SINATRA FAN OR EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT!  EXCELLENT!!!!!!",1146009600,,976,4.337016574585635
1036031,1,6305459592,"I see that a deluxe five DVD set of Barbra Streisand's TV specials has been released recently... So why doesn't Warner/Reprise do the same thing for Frank Sinatra's classic TV specials? Could ""The Family"" be involved perhaps...? Sure, they can get behind a phony ""Sinatra at the Palladium"" multi-media extravaganza where you watch 20-foot projected videos of Sinatra singing accompanied by a live orchestra thanks to ""unprecedented access to Frank Sinatra's film archives""... but they can't seem to get Sinatra's video performance legacy released appropriately on DVD...

The classic 1960s, 70s, and 80s musical TV specials (A Man and His Music Part I & II, Sinatra+Ella+Jobim, The Main Event, etc...) are still being sold as individual DVDs at full price ($15-$20 each). They are each about 50 minutes long with ""stereo"" sound (actually ""2-channel mono"" I think) with no bonus features whatsoever, packaged in flimsy plastic and cardboard cases.

Why don't they compile all 9 of the Reprise Collection Sinatra TV specials in a 3-DVD package with 3 specials per DVD? Price it at about $40-$50, include some bonus goodies (there must be hours of stuff in the vaults... better go with 4 DVDs!) and give this material the deluxe, classy treatment it deserves.

Surely this would sell well enough to justify the minimal investment required (just repackaging/remastering the same old material for the most part). Wouldn't a DVD set like this be a better 90th birthday ""limited edition"" release than reissuing the sub-standard Duets CDs again? And what about all the amazing unreleased audio that remains stagnating in the vaults...? Get with the program, folks!

I am truly very happy for all you Babs fans though! You're ""the luckiest people in the world...""",1133827200,17,1754,5.165492957746479
1036032,1,6305459592,Don't get me wrong I am a huge Sinatra fan....but....the quality of the video and audio were poor at best for today's technology.  I found the video equivalant to copying an old VCR tape to DVD and the Audio was simulated stereo.  I also bought a second one and the quality is the same.  I definately do not recommend this if you are looking for a concert experience.,1115251200,19,367,4.367647058823529
1036033,4,6305459592,"I became a Sinatra fan since I heard ""My Way"" being very young. Since then I learned to appreciate his way of phrasing, as unique in the musiccal world. As time passed and the voice faded gradually, he compensated that with a more dramatic, full of feeling manner of saying every word.

As a paradox, one of the more interesting things about this video, at least for me, was the story that HRH Grace Kelly told at the beginning, that shows what kind of human being Sinatra was. You can also find stories like this in the book that his daughter wrote some 3 or 4 years ago.

So, if you are a Sinatra fan, don`t miss this video.",1097798400,5,626,4.2521008403361344
1036034,5,6305459592,"Ths concert is one of Sinatras best for the time it was done. He was at the height of his power and popularity in Europe. The only thing I found wrong with it was the song , and the introduction of the song, "" I will drink the wine "". I could not understand why a man with such an impeccable repertoire could record such a ridiculous song. His delivery of"" I get along without you very well "" was wonderful. He had the hall at his feet and you could hear the proverbial pin drop. Even though he fluffed the lyrics slightly he turned that beautiful song into the poem that it is.
The concert was spontaneous bright and classic Sinatra. I watch it very often,",1077667200,5,657,4.181102362204724
1036035,5,6305459592,"This is a recording of the second show in the presence of HRH Princess Margaret at London's Royal Festival Hall. Preceding Mr Sinatra's appearance was Bob Hope. These two giants of American entertainment and culture were to have been introduced by Sir Noel Coward who was taken ill and died shortly after the performances.
At short notice, HSH the late Princess Grace of Monaco graciously substituted as compere for the evening billed as ""Night of Nights."" The (charity) event was in aid of the National Association For The Prevention of Cruelty to Children to whom the proceeds and Television fees were paid; HSH Princess Grace and Messrs Hope and Sinatra meeting all of their own costs and in Mr Sinatra's case those of his musicians.
It is especially notable for Mr Sinatra's performance of the rare Lenny Hayton arrangement of George Harrison's ""Something"" and of course the beautiful Nelson Riddle arrangement of ""I Get Along Without You Very Well"" which is performed incomparably and last but not least, the rare Gordon Jenkins arrangement of ""One For My Baby.""
""I Will Drink The Wine"" written by the son of accomplished Anglo-Canadian singer Marion Ryan was a new Sinatra ""pop single"" and like present day ""pop"" pales by comparison with that of Rogers & Hart, Cole Porter etc. It is notable merely that it reflects the post ""flower power / love child"" influences which had such a dibilitating effect upon Western civilised countries.
Accompanied by accomplished jazz musicians and LSO string section, Sinatra is in fine ""Basie"" form and brings a ""looseness/improvisation"" and humour to his readings which sets them apart from those in the recording studio.
In his 50's the voice may not have been as sweet as it was in his 20's but the depth of his readings of the ballads make these performances far superior. The key change in ""I have Dreamed"" proved, if proof were needed that ""retirement"" the following year should never have been a consideration.
In a word this concert is ""incomparable.""",1031184000,14,2000,4.955357142857143
1036036,2,6305459592,"Recorded in November, 1970, about a year after the self-titled SINATRA (1969), this was not an NBC special, but probably a BBC special.
The decline in one year's time is apparent. Noticeable weakening of vocal powers, he looks lifeless, on the opener, ""You Make Me Feel So Young"", he swipes at the high note instead of holding.
He pulls it off because of who he is, but make no mistake: the long nights, booze and smokes caught up for good at this point.
Go back to the previous shows and it is painfully obvious.",995673600,10,513,4.468085106382978

7890075,5,6305459592,"Sinatra, at age 56, at his fightin' weight, yet relaxed and congenial - the elegant venue (and the long, regal introduction by Princess Grace Kelly) did not make him forget his roots: his patter is pure after-hours Manhattan and, as can be expected, his performances are sensational: especially noteworthy is ""One For My Baby"", ""I Get Along Without You Very Well"", ""I Will Drink The Wine"" (an off-kilter, but reflective lyric by a young writer), ""Something"" (with some fine improvisations), and, you know it...""My Way"". Why would anyone want to ""cover"" this song after Francis Albert sang it on record - and at the Royal Festival Hall -for the ages?",1280361600,,649,4.909090909090909
7890076,5,6305459592,"this IS  one of sinatras last concerts before his retirement in the early 70s.although he looks rather gaunt and his hairpiece is dated[modern]his voice is rich and smooth. no graval or sand.just strong and clear.the selection of music is standsrds mixed with current pop writings.
his understanding of the lyrics is never more evident. his appreacition of the orchestra is also evident.all in all a fine preformance from the chairman at the top of his game.",1224892800,,458,5.026315789473684
7890077,4,6305459592,"In my lifetime, no one, not one, could do all the things Frank Sinatra could. He was the ultimate craftsman. Ballad, swing, blues, big band up-tempo, look out, Frank would sew it together to anyone's satisfaction.
This concert with intro by his friend Grace Kelly, shown in color and very good sound, illustrates exactly what this writer said in sentence one. What command! Great pizazz! He's locked in, his leader and the band  too. What a collective effort. Know what? Nearly every available concert you see by Sinatra is one of a kind. No pop singer will ever approach his fastidious approach to delivering vocal and instrumental music. I am buying this and serveral more of his DVD's for Christmas. The present is a forever keeper.",1193529600,,735,4.833333333333333
7890078,5,6305459592,"Since there is so little official video footage of Frank Sinatra live in concert, a dvd like ""In Concert At The Royal Festival Hall"" is a welcome treat for fans. Recorded in 1971, this show was filmed not long before Frank retired later that year (of course, it didn't last long).

This is not a perfect show. Frank at times seems a bit lost and disconnected, and even flubs his line quite a few times (a trait that would plague Sinatra frequently in his final years), though it may or not have been in jest. Also, the sound quality and visual quality borh could've used some much needed sprucing up.

These minor quibbles aside, this is a fantastic show. It starts off with an introduction from Princess Grace Of Monaco (formerly screen legend Grace Kelly) before Ol' Blues Eyes comes out with a swinging new arrangement of ""You Make Me Feel So Young"". Next comes a tight, energetic version of ""Pennies From Heaven"".

In a rare occurence, ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" is one of the lower poitn s of the show. This version lacks energy and Sinatra messes up his timing and he really phones it in here. Things continue to slag a bit with his rendition of The Beatles' ""Something"", a song thast 8 years later that receive a much better treatment from Frank that rivaled the original.

Things begin to pick up with a fun version of ""The Lady Is A Tramp"". Frank flubs a line (""Anyone else?"", he asks, questioning his faux pas), but he still owns the song. Next comes the arguable highlight of the show, as Frank sings his songs for losers.

First is ""I Get Along Without You Very Well"", which Frank does beautifully. Franks draws just the right emotion and gives the song his all. Jimmy Webb's ""Didn't We"" is next. A second-rate composition it is, but Frank makes it work.

Next comes a true classic, as Frank sings the ""Daddy Of These Types Of Songs"", and sinks into a moving ""One For My Baby (And One More For The Road)"". The show, however, falters with the next number, as the pompous ""I Will Drink The Wine"" has Frank attempting to connect with the young ""flower child"" crownd and failing.

Things pick up with a gorgeous rendition of ""I Have Dreamed"" from ""The King And I"". Frank sings this one perfectly. ""My Kind Of Town"" and ""My Way"" finish things off on a high note.

Overall, this is not a perfect show, but a great show that is owrth having in your collection. Hopefully, many more great Siantra concerts (such as 1982's wonderful ""Concert For The Americas"") will find their way to dvd.",1181952000,9,2493,4.5
7890079,4,6305459592,"Frank's voice is rough at times, but he knows how to use the mike like nobody else did to camaflage it or use it for poignancy.  Good selection of songs from the Great American Song Book including 'I Get Along Without You Very Well' and 'I Have Dreamed.' Nice version of 'Something in the Way She Moves."" Sometimes the band is uncommonly loud which Frank humourously comments on. Look for Tony Bennet in the audience at the end when the camera pans left.",1180051200,,454,4.469879518072289
