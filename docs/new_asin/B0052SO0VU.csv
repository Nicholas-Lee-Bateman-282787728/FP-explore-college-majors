4530881,5,B0052SO0VU,Being over 60 I felt nostalgic about it. It carried my senses back to the beautiful years of the 1960s and I was in a state of joy during every moment while watching it. Also unexpectedly the quality of the picture was very good.,1356048000,,229,4.2272727272727275
4530882,5,B0052SO0VU,"Silly old rom-com, but a must for any car buff.  Set during the
Monte Carlo Grand Prix, there are (now) many classic sports and
racing cars in the movie, some quite prominently used, like a 60's
300 SL Mercedes Cabriolet and 3500 GT Spyder Maserati. The fact
that it is finally available after over 40 years, speaks for the long
lasting interest in this film.",1350345600,4,359,4.523076923076923
4530883,5,B0052SO0VU,"Here's another classic from 1963, with Glenn Ford, Hope Lange, Ricardo Montalban, Telly Savalas and Charles Boyer on the Riveria matching rich untitled people with poor titled one.  Boyer tries to arrange Lange and Montalban to get together, but they both fall for other people.  This is a cute, romantic comedy, even predictable, but great entertainment.",1324944000,12,355,5.321428571428571
4530884,4,B0052SO0VU,"Yes, this movie is a bit dated and corny, but I remember loving it in my youth (and I still enjoyed it upon my recent viewing).  Stars Glenn Ford and Hope Lange were never more attractive in this romantic comedy.  The supporting cast features Charles Boyer, Ricardo Montalban, Telly Savalas and a very young John Wood.  The story centers around Boyer's *business* of taking poor but titled gentlemen and arranging marriages with heiresses.  Montalban is the penniless noble; Lange the airhead heiress.  Glenn Ford joins the plot to introduce the two by becoming the family's chauffeur.  She fancies race cars; he, it turns out, was a winning race car driver. Naturally, they fall for each other.  Filmed on the Riviera, the scenery is spectacular.  The plot, as I said, is obvious and old-fashioned.  Nevertheless, it's romantic and fun.  Enjoy!",1318809600,24,845,5.014388489208633

4530891,5,B0052SO0VU,"I love Glenn Ford even though the bulk of his work was done before my time.  He is a natural actor and always seems to play himself.  That said this movie fits him to a tea......a former Formula I race car driver is hired by a  group of con artists that match poor but titled men with aristocratic Europeans.  Unfortunately their latest hunk, played by a very young Ricardo Montalban,  is sorely lacking in most areas of being an aristocrat. He can't dance, can't ride a horse, can't drive a car. What he has though is enough charisma in his speech with his dulcet pear shaped tones and accent to melt ice in the north pole.  The prey Charles Boyer and his crew is planning on snagging is an heiress played by Hope Lange. Ford is hired to teach Montalban everything he lacks while playing chauffeur to Lange and her family.  It isn't long before Ford is noticed by Lange for more than his driving skills and comedy ensues.  .",1453852800,,925,4.4

4530896,5,B0052SO0VU,"In this charming tale, Etienne (played by Charles Boyer) plays matchmaker, making a good living marrying off poor but titled young men to rich but untitled young ladies. Millicent (played by Hope Lange) is the next opportunity after meeting her uncle Dr. Christian Gump (played by Telly Savalas), on the Riviera. Grand Duke Gaspar is who he plans matching her with. Things don't always go as planned, as Millicent begins to show an interest in her placed in chauffeur John Lathrop Davis a retired race car champion (played by Glen Ford). Gaspar reveals he may care for Etienne's secretary Janine (played by Ulla Jacobsson). Ruth Mcdevitt plays Mathilda, Millicent's wise grandmother . In the end they must find out who they truly have feelings for, in this must see 1963 film. After seeing this movie, I knew I wanted it, and found it on Amazon. Now I can watch this when I like.",1445558400,2,879,4.751633986928105

4530903,5,B0052SO0VU,"Being a sailor and ex-race car driver, this story is full of technical holes, both literally and figuratively. But it is delightful anyway. Glenn Ford and Hope Lange are charming together. And how can you go wrong with Charles Boyer cast as a professional matchmaker?",1419206400,,267,4.955555555555556
4530904,4,B0052SO0VU,I am a Glenn Ford fan and found this movie. It is certainly not an Oscar contender but enjoyable. Telly Savalas is charming and who can resist  Charles Boyer. I love Hope Lange and Ruth McDevitt.,1418428800,2,195,4.416666666666667
4530905,4,B0052SO0VU,"An entertaining sixties romantic comedy that Glenn Ford had down pat.  Hope Lange, usually the intelligent one, is a wild and crazy heiress on the Riviera.  Charles Boyer leads a crew that finds rich women for poor members of the aristocracy with a title and no money.  In this case he is transforming Ricardo Montalban into a smooth and debonair  member of the royalty to wed off to Hope Lange.  Hoping to get the money to repair his boat, a former cowboy and champion race driver, agrees to teach him to ride and drive a car.  Then he gets roped into being her chauffeur and the sparks fly.  Fun little romp.",1411430400,,610,4.441441441441442

4530914,5,B0052SO0VU,Aloha! A bygone era for sure! I recall seeing this movie in theaters way back in the 1960s! It was a fun romp then and it still is! I always liked Glenn Ford and now I know why I really liked Hope Lange ... Quality of the movie in DVD form was really good. Worthy of the price.,1366243200,5,277,3.793103448275862
8454342,3,B0052SO0VU,Glenn Ford is about 46 in this movie which may explain what looks like a heavily shoe polished hair styling (combed forward even !) Hope Lang is a good 16 years younger so the romance between them isn't  completely believable. The tone of the movie wants to be modern but carefully teeters on the edge of it as Lang's belly button is covered even when she wears midriff baring outfits and it's implied that she & Ford sleep together but nothing is said or shown. It's unclear why Ford falls for her but since she's set her sights on him he gives in rather easily. OK entertainment if it's free & you don't expect to much from it,1514160000,,628,4.322033898305085

8454349,3,B0052SO0VU,"Very shallow plot, of course, that only set up the rest of the hour and a half of slap stick.  The manufactured-on-demand procedure appears to result in poor soundtracks such that Boyer's English is hardly intelligible most of the time.  Similarly, the females are hard to understand in general at their speaking rates and by usually speaking at the same time..  The poor plot was only partially redeemed by the stars, the Riviera and suggested Swiss backgrounds, and the luxury mansions.  All in all the visual quality of the film was its greatest or only feature. For Ford this was another marginal effort like Dear Heart where he was paired with Geraldine Paige who was fairly pathetic to watch in that dull production..",1473465600,,723,4.853658536585366
