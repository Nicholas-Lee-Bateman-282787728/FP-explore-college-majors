8377113,1,B002PMVPNM,"Much of the narrative about the failure to search for survivors after the sinking of the Juneau is BUTT COVERING! The fearful trepidation over whether or not there was a risk attached to searching for survivors could also have been applied to going to War at all! The comment that the truth about the loss of the Juneau not being released until 1943,""... when it was obvious that the Allies were going to win the War..."" is shameful! The air war in Europe was going badly! The Memphis Belle, the first bomber and crew to complete the, then tour of twenty five missions, waited until May 19, 1945. The losses had been so horrific that B17 crews were deserting by flying to neutral countries and sitting out the rest of the War, because statistical their life expectancy was too short! Overall, approximately, 43,000 planes were lost. Each B17 carried a crew of ten men each B24 carried a crew of nine, any way you slice it that is a lot of men, potentially 430, 000! D Day was still a dream, Tarawa a soon to be nightmare, the Battle of the Bulge an unexpected blow to the gut, the Battle of the Philippine Sea a tragedy averted by the hand of God, Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Okinawa, blood bathes that make the casualties of the war against terror seem to be nothing more than a passenger plane crash by comparison! The ignorance of the 'so called' experts is embarrassing, who ought to be ashamed! This was not a fitting tribute to the Sullivans but a juvenile excuse for why no one tried to save them! Admiral Halsey got it right! History Channel did not!",1459296000,2,1552,4.46830985915493
