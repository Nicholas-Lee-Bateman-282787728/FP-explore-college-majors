5058322,5,B0076Q2N6U,"My son was so sad when Nickelodeon took this off the air a couple of months ago.  I didn't want to buy used VHS tapes for him, and was hoping that DVDs would finally become available.  Nice picture quality, although the cases and disks look completely bootlegged because they are produced on DVD-Rs by Amazon.  Still, if your kids just love this show, it's nice to finally have a DVD collection of them.

The two things missing from these DVD sets are 1: Shaina's picture on the front of the DVDs.  That seems like a weird exclusion.  2: Special Features.  There are absolutely NONE.  I really would have enjoyed seeing interviews with Ron and Natalie or the kids who are all grown up now.

5058354,5,B0076Q2N6U,What can I say.  I have been in love with this series since it originally aired in the early to mid 90's.  I'm not sure what makes it stand out in children programs.  But it is a captivating series.  I find that the old and young enjoy singing and dancing to the tunes.  The family is simply adorable.  And the learning techniques simply.  Gullah Gullah Island is a mystical fantasy land where your children can learn about low country SC culture while enjoying timeless children classics as well as interesting stories.,1451088000,4,520,4.648351648351649
5058355,1,B0076Q2N6U,I was only interested in watching the 'Beat It' episode because my daughter was in the background of the 5th grade class featured. I only caught a glimpse of her once or twice. She attended Shell Point Elem. School when we lived in Beaufort and her father was stationed at the Naval Hospital.,1449014400,,292,4.528301886792453
5058356,5,B0076Q2N6U,Gullah Gullah is great for all generations to watch. We love it here. I watched it as a kid and now my daughter loves it. Lots of music and interaction. Good quality tv program for kids. Lots of learning going on. My toddler knows all the songs and all the characters and I don't feel as guilty letting her watch a program like this. Its perfect. Everyone needs this in their life. All the 90s kids can relive their childhoods. ;-),1444521600,2,431,4.333333333333333

5058358,5,B0076Q2N6U,My son loves this show just like I did when I was a kid. ITs not like these new childrens shows whose messages can sometimes be a little too mature.

We have streamed seasons 1 and 2, and I just purchased seasons 3 and 4 on DVD for an upcoming road trip since they don't carry this series at my local library. My children really like the stories told and the kid-appropriate humor included. They seem to enjoy the music most of all and are always dancing and singing along when they watch. There is always a positive message, and I appreciate the series' depiction of community. An added bonus is that the majority of the characters look like them (note: it is a diverse cast). I wish there were more shows like this on air now. My children tire of cartoons, but aren't quite old enough for the non-cartoon Disney shows/sitcoms.",1431561600,,721,4.511450381679389
