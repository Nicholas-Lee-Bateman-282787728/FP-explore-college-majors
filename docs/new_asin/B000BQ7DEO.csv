8090950,2,B000BQ7DEO,"I was disappointed with the video. It was really nothing more than a repetitive slideshow with music and rudimentary animation. I bought it for my two and a half, now three year old son and it barely catches his attention. I supposed this is something that you could leave on repeat in the background so that it would breed familiarity with numbers. My son usually just asks me to change the video after the first 10-15 minutes. Perhaps my son was too old (or watches too much TV) for this video to be effective? I don't know. I just know I was hoping for more. I just can't bring myself to recommend it.",1368576000,,604,4.353982300884955

8090952,5,B000BQ7DEO,"Our 3,5 year old son has very limited speech and don't like a lot of the learning DVD s on the market I think they are to busy for him, but this DVD was just perfect for him, very repetitive with out getting boring, after about a week of very intensive watching he got the numbers down, counts to 10 and have number recognition we could not be more proud of him and we are very grateful for this product. We just received the alphabet today and I am very hopefull.",1273708800,,464,4.1098901098901095
8090953,5,B000BQ7DEO,"I got the ABC's dvd first and my son, (he was 2 years old) used to watch the dvd and sometimes he was playing and listening to dhe dvd and one days he started repetieng the abc's and i noticed he knew all the letters, and I was looking for the couting dvd at the store i got the first dvd and i didn't find it,  i was looking for that dvd a long time until I started looking online for the dvd and the first website that has the dvd is AMAZON .
And now my son enjoys the dvd maybe not with the same interest than the first one but the collection is really good for young children to learn and memorice abc's and numbers.
I recommend the product. And of course i recommend shopping at AMAZON.",1204243200,,691,3.971223021582734
8090954,4,B000BQ7DEO,"My 2 year old son has just begun learning to say numbers 1-10, which makes this video perfect for him.  He can count along with the visual and audio presentation of numbers 1-10.  He also takes time to label the parrots, ducks, fish and other images he recognizes.  My five month old, alternatively, was not interested in any part of it.  TV isn't his thing just yet.  At  any rate, this is like a slideshow presentation that allows my 2 year old to practice counting, over and over, amidst images of animals, toys, and actions he alreadys knows about.  It gives me a break from counting to ten all day--a nice relief!",1185494400,,618,4.464285714285714
