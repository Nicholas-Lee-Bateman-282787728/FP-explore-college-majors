Undoubtedly our parents watched the originals, but like anything, it was new to us and we loved them anyway.  We didn't have a color television set and these nostalgic selections do bring back memories.

It was serious stuff when Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger) and Jay Silverheels (Tonto) hit the little screen.  There's not a lot of analyzing to do about this series because most kids I know simply loved the duo.  If you like oldies, but goodies, you'll love this sampling.  FYI, ""Outlaws in Grease Paint"" was the last episode in the series.

5572306,5,B00BC1UO7K,"""it's the only episode where the Lone Ranger removed his mask"". I have not watched this episode yet but I can state that over the run of the show he appeared a number of times without his mask. On those occasions, he had makeup (such as a beard or whiskers) on as a disguise and did not appear barefaced (except for the mask) as he did when being the Lone Ranger.

""the opening bars of the William Tell Overture"". Actually the the opening bars of the LAST MOVEMENT/FINALE of the William Tell Overture.

There is another movement of the overture almost as famous which is not normally recognized as being the William Tell Overture. This is the Storm (2nd?) movement. Most people if they hear it will recognize it as storm music but not as being part of the William Tell Overture. This movement was used by Disney for the ""Old Mill"" cartoon and a number of studios (such as Disney and Looney Tunes) had a cartoon where all their characters were orchestra musicians playing the full William Tell Overture.",1370304000,,1002,4.561111111111111
5572307,5,B00BC1UO7K,"Though The Lone Ranger was produced way before my time, my father is an ardent fan and I remember watching re-runs with him back in the 70s and 80s, when I was a child. I have such fond memories of humming the tune from the soundtrack featuring The William Tell Overture and despite being a girl, quite enjoyed the pair's adventures through the wild west.

Clayton Moore who portrayed The Lone Ranger in the iconic TV show was reputed to have said:
""Kids nowadays aren't so quick to worship heroes. The world is a lot more complicated; we don't seem to believe in absolute good and evil-white hats and black hats-anymore. It's fashionable to think of virtue and honor and bravery as naive, outmoded emotions. Deep down, I believe that people still cling to those ideals. When I first appeared on television as the Lone Ranger, Jay Silverheels (Tonto) and I used to do a lot of public appearances. Years earlier, when George W. Trendle created the Lone Ranger for the radio, he gave his writers a code of behavior that the Lone Ranger and Tonto must live by. Jay and I were heroes to millions of kids, and to avoid disappointing them, we lived by Trendle's original rules""

What a contrast to the present day where celebrity role models are few and far between!

This DVD (I was provided a review copy by the seller), ""The Lone Ranger: Who Was That Masked Man?"" features eight random episodes:
The Masked Rider(Season One, original airdate December 15, 1949, B&W)
Gold Train (Season One, original airdate March 16, 1950, B&W)
Bad Medicine (Season Two, original airdate December 7, 1950, B&W)
The Hooded Men (Season Two, original airdate February 22, 1951, B&W)
Two for Juan Ringo (Season Four, original airdate December 23, 1954, B&W)
Wanted: The Lone Ranger (Season Four, original airdate May 5, 1955, B&W)
The Return of Don Pedro O'Sullivan (Season Five, original airdate October 25, 1956, Color)
Outlaws in Greasepaint (Season Five, original airdate June 6 1957, Color) - in this episode The Lone Ranger actually removes his mask though he is in another disguise!

It might be noted that episodes from Season Three are noticeably absent. Fans of the show might recall that John Hart played the role of The Lone Ranger in Season Three before Clayton Moore took back the reins in Seasons 4 and 5.

The total running time is approx. 200 minutes. There is no Closed Caption/Subtitle option which would have been nice for the hearing-impaired. The sound quality is clear and the image is also crisp given the show's age. This would make a nice gift for a Lone Ranger fan and is budget friendly.",1369872000,3,2591,4.748888888888889

8565649,5,B00BC1UO7K,"The Lone Ranger and Tonto (Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels) were on TV from 1949 through 1956 plus they starred in two
full length motion pictures.  Their episodes expounded The Golden Rule.  There was minimum violence, excellent production values and two actors who believed what they were doing and understanding their characters.  The show was aimed at children but the episodes were appreciated by adults as well.  This compilation of episodes as the DVD The Lone Ranger, Volume 1 and Hi-Yo Silver, Away picked excellent episodes to share with the viewing audiences.  Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels are no longer with us but their characters have been in our hearts for the last 64 years.  The new movie with Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer have opened and closed in two months.  The old adage of ""If it's not broken, don't fix it.""  There was a certain magic with the Lone Ranger.  Lucky for the TV viewer, that magic still exists.",1377043200,4,938,4.8125
8565650,5,B00BC1UO7K,"I grew up watching the Lone Ranger as a child and I remember it well.  In those days TV consisted of westerns and police shows.  Watching this brought back great memories of playing the Lone Ranger in the back yard as he was everyones hero.  Tonto too!  I really enjoyed seeing the old episodes but I don't recall Tonto getting beat up so much!

 It was also fun to see Clayton Moore and Silver riding across the screen.  Several of the bit actors in some of the episodes became famous in later years and I even remember seeing Lenard McCoy from Star Trek as the Sherriff in one of the shows.

 When we got our first TV this was about the only show that the family really watched with a passion.  The DVD still portrays the episodes in Black and White but the film quality is good and I enjoyed seeing them again.  The last two episodes on the disk were in color and it really surprised me.  I don't remember them being in color but we probably just didn't have a color TV at that time.  I will not list the episodes on the disk as it has already been done by several reviewers.  If you loved the Lone Ranger as a child then you need to watch this and bring back the memories.  One of my favorite toys was a set of pistols and a holster with silver bullets in the holster belt.  What kid didn't want that!

I gave it 5 stars.

I was supplied a copy for evaluation and I promised to give a fair and honest review.",1372377600,,1412,4.1286764705882355
8565651,5,B00BC1UO7K,"My husband loves all of the Lone Ranger titles, so when Dreamwork Classics offered me the opportunity to try these out and comment on them for a review, I was happy to do so.

The works are amazingly clear given the age of the original series, and the sound quality was well done. I found no problems with watching them, except to get them away from my husband long enough to check them out for a review.

Besides my husband's enjoyment of the series, I have fond memories of them as a child, watching the series with my family. While the final episodes were in color, I can only tell by watching them today, since we did not have a color TV and all of them were black and white for us.

These 8 episodes are especially fun to watch.

Five stars because of the quality of the reproduction.",1371427200,,789,4.275167785234899
