4717832,5,B005KK2FOO,"Uplifting movie with a beautiful and heart warming storyline.  My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed it!  I thought this was simply a ""kids"" movie and on the contrary it was much more.  Have recommended it to several of my adult friends who don't even have children.  And for you ladies....there is some very nice eye candy in the film...David James Elliott and Ed Quinn (who looks very much like Bradley Cooper).  Ooh, la la!",1367280000,7,429,4.666666666666667

4717847,5,B005KK2FOO,Great movie,1441152000,,11,5.0
4717848,4,B005KK2FOO,"I like the camp parts of this movie. The kids are funny and the lessons aren't too overbearing. Lots of funny, root for the underdog campers moments. The beginning with the one kid at his home is stupid and out of place, but overall it's a cute movie kids will like. Lots of kid friendly antics.",1438473600,,295,4.285714285714286
4717849,5,B005KK2FOO,"Very good movie combining adults with problems and kids with equal life problems of a different kind. Some might think it a waste to watch,but I enjoyed it. If you enjoy ornery kids and an interesting way of handling them, you will enjoy this movie. Takes you back to summer camp and the memory of good friends made there.",1433721600,,322,4.47457627118644
4717850,5,B005KK2FOO,Great movie!,1430524800,,12,5.5
4717851,4,B005KK2FOO,"Who's this movie for? Hard to say exactly, but parents can enjoy it on more than one level, while its appeal to kids will likely be limited to the humor. The bits where the dialogue gets serious (the adults conversing with one another) will probably not hold the attention of most children. Although there's nothing groundbreaking here, it did make me chuckle, and at certain points gave me a warm fuzzy feeling (who doesn't like that?!) Stephen Tobolowsky makes an appearance as the school principal, and you may recognize a couple of other faces too (like Ed Quinn).

Why is my review biased? Well, for 2 reasons: [1] I've spent a fair bit of time with Chris Watson, the director of Rainbow Tribe, on some of his visits to the US, and [2] Rebecca Mader has a small role in the movie (I fell for Rebecca from the first second I saw her on the epic TV serial&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0036EH3WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>, so I'll basically watch anything that she's in). Was Rainbow Tribe worth my time? Yes!",1427414400,2,1076,5.113636363636363
4717852,2,B005KK2FOO,"This movie will leave your kids with more questions than answers!  One of the main characters ""Booh"" doesn't talk because of a past trauma.  The character is made to look like a girl and you spend much of the film trying to figure out if Booh is actually a boy or a girl.  I'm still not really sure.  There's also talk about sexual puberty which isn't appropriate for seven year olds.  It's not all bad....there are some mildly amusing moments with food fights, kids bantering, etc.  Overall it's laregly forgetable for parents and children.",1426896000,2,541,4.702127659574468
4717853,5,B005KK2FOO,"What a great movie!  I saw this movie at a friend's house and I just had to get it.  This is actually a double story.  One story has the main character, Morgan (AKA-Chief), with a serious issue going on in his life and he is looking for a way to deal with it.  The second story is about six boys at a Summer camp.  The boys all have different backgrounds, personalities, and problems of their own.  It is where the two stories come together that amazing and miraculous things happen.  The movie has a lot of really funny moments that had me laughing, but it also packs a powerful message that really made me think about life and priorities.",1425686400,7,640,4.3277310924369745
4717854,5,B005KK2FOO,i like movies like this but this one lacked something in the story but did like it ok.,1424476800,,86,3.8333333333333335

4717858,5,B005KK2FOO,I great film.  It showed what could be accomplished with problem children if one takes the time and patience.  I will probably watch It again.,1418688000,,142,4.64
4717859,5,B005KK2FOO,"This movie was very entertaining and had very funny moments along with sad parts.  The acting was very good, including the young boys, and their antics and interactions were very typical of youngsters at camp.  The movie has a strong message and is a great family movie.",1416096000,3,270,4.723404255319149
4717860,5,B005KK2FOO,"Love David James Elliott since JAG. But love his movies even more. This one is a true movie. My favorite kind. It is hysterical, maddening group gang of kids, with one you want to get your hands on, but eventually you love him as with all the kids. Elliott is ill, (not going to tell you all) he goes back to this Camp he was in as a child, to work some things out. Just be ready for a great ride and journey through this film. I assure you, you will laugh, perhaps cry and be inspired, an expect to be blessed.",1414368000,4,511,4.019607843137255

4717867,2,B005KK2FOO,"I watched this for about 30 minutes before (yawn) turning it off).  My 25 year old said, ""Why did you wait so long?"".  This might be a movie tweens 10-12 might like, but I kept wondering why two girls were staying in a cabin with the other boys until I finally figured out they were boys.  Not a great movie at all.",1400198400,2,315,4.048387096774194
4717868,5,B005KK2FOO,Wonderful story that explores some deep themes with adults and children.  A great family movie and movie that makes points against bullying for children who are different or in difficult circumstances.  This plays along with some hard decisions in the adults lives and also shows a loving strong marriage when someone is fighting a serious illness.  It all fits together.  Have watched it many times and will keep it in my collection!,1398297600,,434,4.986111111111111

4717872,1,B005KK2FOO,"The movie was yukky!  I can see why it was so difficult to find.  I bought it because of David James Elliot, but personally he shouldn't have lowered himself to be in such a wasted movie.  I watched 10 minutes of it, then took it out and gave it away.",1389916800,,251,3.98
4717873,5,B005KK2FOO,I heard about this from a friend and ordered it...Kids and grown up kids love it. Recommend it to families with kids that are a lil rambuncious,1389052800,,143,4.333333333333333

4717876,3,B005KK2FOO,Cute kid flick. I would recommend for younger kids on a Saturday night. Didn't have any names I recognized but as it started I definitely knew the faces from other kid shows. It should keep there attention just with that.,1378080000,,221,4.55
4717877,5,B005KK2FOO,"A funny hearttouching movie about a man who has to face his choices for future - does he want to make another chemo or not. He choses a job as a camp leader to get away for a while and to make up his decision. Great story about live, friendship and everything else what is important in live. Some of the scenes are just funtastic and so funny. Great movie for the whole family.",1376870400,,377,4.108108108108108

8476870,5,B005KK2FOO,"Okay, I have to admit a few things:
MY kids are in their forties...
My waistsize's in its forties.
Saw parts of this in a doctor's waiting
room--- I am 67, and fading fast--- I
asked the receptionist what the movie
was. She looked puzzled for a moment.
She said it was HER family's favorite
""GO TO"" movie.
What the hey; the price was reasonable.
It has a duel plot thread. One about the lead-character's issues,
and, the other about six boys at Summer camp. The boys, all,
have problems too. WHEN the two stories unite, miracles happen.
The movie is, both, funny and touching.",1472515200,,576,4.495238095238095
