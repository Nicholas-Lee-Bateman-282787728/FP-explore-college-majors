8087371,3,B000BJ7BAC,"Candice Olsen is a premier designer and I follow her work religiously.  Unfortunately, this DVD was of previously aired shows.  I should have read the description of the DVD better prior to ordering. Also, the material is dated several years back.",1266796800,3,247,5.0
8087372,3,B000BJ7BAC,"the package has 2 dvds, one contains 4 shows which are kind of old compared to what is currently on tv. the other dvd picks on one of the shows (bath redesign) and talks about what happens behind the scenes.

You still get good ideas and tips however it didn't fit my expectations, i was looking for more contemporary design since we are building our home",1232496000,11,355,4.378787878787879

8087374,5,B000BJ7BAC,I have to buy all of these because our crappy cable company no longer gives us HGTV--and it takes up too much room on Tivo.....now I'm just waiting for the category of living rooms and great rooms because renovating kitchens and bathrooms is way too expensive and done so infrequently.  Candice is the best!,1207958400,7,307,4.685185185185185
