On the feminine side we have Amparito Arozamena amd Alma Rosa Aguirre as the help. Mrs. Fanny Schiller, Nora Veryn and Lupe Llaca as the popoff (spoiled rotten) and on the masculine side we have Varelita, Rubn Rojo and Don Domingo Soler. Miguel Aceves Meja appears briefly, singing...

All this mix-up happens in the house when Claudia (Aguirre) is hired by Felipe (Rojo) but is mistaken as being his fiancee. When Teresa (Veryn) the real fiancee arrives with her mother they all make fun of Claudia, who feeling ridiculed quits.
Mr. Ernesto (Soler) is on her side because he likes her attitude of real woman (he doesn't like women who smoke, drink or wear nylon stockings) and asks her to stay. But then she is framed by the jealous women, who accuse her of stealing.
Yet another mix-up takes place when Irene's (Llaca) boyfriend, ''accidentally'' kisses Felipe's fiancee. From here, is just like a roller coaster, and gets better by the minute...",1316822400,,1092,4.742105263157895
