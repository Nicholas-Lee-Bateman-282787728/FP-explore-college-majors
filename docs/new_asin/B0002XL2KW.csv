2135915,5,B0002XL2KW,"I only got to see this show when I was six and then when I was eighteen. When I was a kid it came on just before Masters of the Universe. It was in syndication at the time. Anyways, I watch both the first and second seasons on dvd when I eat my lunch. Makes me feel young again. I recently showed two episodes to my ten year old nephew and he got the biggest kick out of them.

  I think that this is a wonderful series to show a kid. Take a chance, not all kids these days are cynical.

  The dvds themselves look great. The pictures have really been preserved well. Sound is decent too. I wish there a few more extras, but what's offered is still good. If you are a fan of this show, or just a fan of classic tv in general, then buy this set. It's a great value.

  By the way, I read on another website that the third season is scheduled to hit retail on March 1st. Hope this alleviates any anxiety, lol.",1107043200,7,907,3.9668508287292816
2135916,5,B0002XL2KW,"I spent around $100 on a set of VHS tapes of this series on Ebay back in the '90s, thinking that they would not be released for some time on DVD. Finally, here they are. The second season is quite possibly the creepiest season, as the show had developed a following and more writers seemed interested in creating stories for it. Fantastic tales like ""The Zarn"" and ""Gravity Storm"" showcased the series' advanced technical effects and stop-motion animation, features that were a novelty on Saturday Morning television. Two of my favorites dealt with the Pylons and their control over the Land of the Lost: ""The Longest Day"" occurs when a Pylon malfunctions and Rick Marshall must convince the Sleestak that the pylons are to blame, while ""Black Out"" revolves around the Sleestak's subsequent knowledge of the workings of the clock pylon and their attempts to keep it dark all the time. As mentioned in other reviews, the commentaries are spectacular. Wesley Eure and Kathleen Coleman alternate between making fun of each other's (and Spencer Milligan's) acting capabilities and expressing true respect and awe for a series that was trying to push the boundaries of Saturday morning entertainment.",1104710400,10,1195,5.071065989847716
2135917,5,B0002XL2KW,"Going back into time and being 6 years old again...what a feeling!  I did not remember season 2 as well as season 1, but I loved it!  The quiz (hosted by Wesley Eure aka Will...he is still nice looking even if he is 30 years older!)  on the special features was fun.  I didn't remember as much as the first season's questions, but I still got a lot right!  I loved the special effects and the story lines.  It was fun to watch the show with my 6 year old.  She can't get enough of the show.  It is playing on the DVD player every day.  Come on Season 3!!  Thanks Rhino for doing this for us!  These shows are great for younger kids to watch without their parents having to be in the room all the time too.",1104451200,7,705,4.0
2135918,5,B0002XL2KW,I have notices many people who have bought this a similar items bought it to watch themselves (the 30 something crowd) for the momories of childhood.  The DVD extras are wonderful.,1104019200,,180,4.806451612903226
2135919,5,B0002XL2KW,"I have to confess the second season of Land of the Lost is my favorite. Partially, because it introduced my favorite villain of the series--the Zarn.

I don't know why the Zarn, wasn't continued on into the third season, but I loved that creature of lights, who could be harmed by humans just getting emotionally wound up. Whoever thought up the concept should be commended big time. It's little touches like these that make the program ahead of its time in so many ways, and though the special effects seem a little obsolete today, the writing and character development were top notch.

While the extras on this set are not nearly as elaborate as on the first season, the commentary and subsequent interviews are fantastic, and really helps to give the show a history that the original viewers in the seventies were unaware of.

Rhino is to be commended for the work they've put into these sets. They didn't have to go through all this work, but to their credit they did. And hopefully, they will continue to bring us more goodies from the seventies and eighties. Bring on season three, the Bugaloos, and Lidsville.

Sincerely,

JThree

2135925,4,B0002XL2KW,"Watching Land of the Lost on Saturday mornings with a big bowl of Captain Crunch is one of my most cherished memories from my childhood. After ordering this DVD set, I have to say that the series has held up amazingly well for a kid's show from the 70's. As an adult, I can appreciate the incredibly imaginative and surprisingly well written sci-fi stories that drive the adventures of the Marshalls. Plus, the kid in me is still giddy every time Grumpy the tyrannosaurus and all of the other brilliantly animated creatures show up. There is definitely some cheese , as was prevalent in most 70's era TV shows, but it never diminishes all of the things that made this show great. The only reason that I didn't give it a full five star review is because this isn't the older Rhino Video release that had loads of great extras. There are no notable extras in this set. It's really a shame because I've read great things about the cool commentary and other extras in that set. In any case, the episodes themselves are still fantastic, and that's all that really matters.",1438992000,,1067,4.5625

2135944,5,B0002XL2KW,We had so much fun watching this series- all 3 seasons!  Kids love the dinosaurs and sleestacks and Chaka!  Dad (I) loves the scifi elements and reliving this great show from his childhood!  The Rhino releases of seasons 1-3 featured a plethora of fun interviews and commentary tracks for fans.  Kudos to Rhino for putting those out and doing such a nice job on those.  The current DVD sets are great for casual fans or to keep these fun shows circulating in the rental market.  Yeah!,1367798400,,484,4.569767441860465

2135946,5,B0002XL2KW,If you loved Land of the Lost as a kid like I did.... this is a great trip down memory lane.  The ultra cheesy 1970's style makes it a classic... and I thoroughly enjoyed watching every episode.,1344124800,,194,4.243243243243243
2135947,4,B0002XL2KW,I have loved this series since a small child so I went ahead and purchased these. Originally I had bought the 1st season Rhino version release which was superior to these new Universal discs in many ways. I'm kicking myself for not buying all the Rhino versions 10 years ago. Almost Impossible to find those now and expensive. The Universal disc are completely passable but very plain packaging with no extras or commentary. I don't think the picture quality is as good either.,1318896000,,477,4.759036144578313
2135948,3,B0002XL2KW,"I was born in 1973, so of course I grew up watching Land Of The Lost and loved it! A few years ago, I was elated to learn that this series was now available in a DVD collection, by Rhino. I bought the complete first season and enjoyed reliving my childhood. However, recently I tried to purchase season 2 and 3 and ran into a dilemma. I had the choice of buying the remaining seasons from the Rhino collection, as before, or from a new collection put out by Universal Studios. I searched all the reviews on Amazon to determine which release was better and to make sure the new Universal releases had good special features like all the commentary the Rhino releases had, but could not find one review that would say one way or the other. I finally gambled and went with the newer releases by Universal because they had better looking covers compared to the Rhino releases and I was thinking ""newer release should equal better."" I quickly learned, after they were delivered, that the cover-art was where Universal's superiority ends. The Universal releases basically did not have any special feature except for a short interview with Sid and Marty Krofft at the end of Season 3.

Also, as if that wasn't enough, the menu interface was so bad and unfriendly that whoever designed it should probably be fired. The menu would have only three or two episode thumbnails on each menu page, and they were arranged in a way that made it difficult to move and highlight one episode to the next or to select the ""more"" link. The cases are also difficult to put back into the main case. After I received my Universal DVDs and discovered how bad they were, I did an online search (outside of Amazon) and finally found reviews telling me what I'm telling you now. I wouldn't recommend buying the Universal releases unless you're a major collector and want them for the cover-art or don't care for the special features the Rhino collection has. This is one of those rare cases when the newer release is not nearly as good as the older release. I hope this helps someone avoid making the same mistake I made. Hopefully, I will be able to sell my Universal releases (at a really low price) to someone who doesn't care about the differences. I have since bought season 2 and 3 from Rhino and enjoy them very much!

By the way, I was also profoundly disappointed in the new Land Of The Lost movie, starring Will Ferrell. I could have written a better script in my sleep, casted better actors more suitable for those characters, and directed a far better film, even though I've never directed a movie before in my life! Here's a clue to those who made that movie. The series has always been viewed by the original fans as creepy and scary! It was never meant to be turned into a comedy!",1306886400,,2765,4.516966067864272
2135949,4,B0002XL2KW,"The special effects might be dated and cheesy, but the stories are quite entertaining in this second season of ""Land of the Lost"".  The series has much appeal for nostalgia, and fans of all ages can be drawn into the adventures of Marshall, Will, and Holly.  This DVD set has no bonus features related to the show but has a good quality picture and sound transfer.  The series is very enjoyable if you want to see what creative children's TV was like back in the 1970's.  Watching this show again after all of these years was great fun.",1260057600,,536,4.438775510204081

2135959,4,B0002XL2KW,"After I saw the extremely awesome Land of the Lost movie, I wanted to see the series that started it all! Return to the Land of the Lost with Marshall, Will, Holly, Cha-Ka, Enik, Grumpy, Big Alice, and the Sleestak! The Marshalls are still trying to get home, and throughout the season they must deal with Sleestak, the Zarn, help Cha-Ka steal a dinosaur egg, survive powerful storms, blackouts, and much more!

2135961,5,B0002XL2KW,"Return to the Land of the Lost, with the Sleestaks, the Lost City and the Pylons.  But now add such great ideas as the new alien called the Zarn, the Library of Skulls and the Mist Marsh.  With writers such as Theodore Sturgeon and the return of such actors such as Walker Edmission who plays Enik the second season is even better.  The unlimited imagination and the advanced science fiction plots are piled onto the solid framework from the first season.  Like a good cake that finally gets some home made icing.

But we also see the evolution of the family.  They are working together to survive - the cave has a lived in look, the ropes and pulleys they have made, the new tools and even clothing they have created.  They show us how the Marshalls test new plants and food on animals and deal with daily life.  They wish to escape yet at the same time try to make the Land of the Lost a home.",1169683200,3,895,4.285714285714286
2135962,1,B0002XL2KW,I was totally shocked at the uninteresting dvd collection.it has a good front cover looking  much better than it is. Everything is so unproffesionaly acted even from a kids point of view!!,1168473600,,188,4.875
2135963,5,B0002XL2KW,"The video transfer to DVD is great.  The ""extras"" included commentary from cast members who appreciate the show for what it was, without taking it too seriously.  My children (both under 10) love this show.",1164931200,2,206,4.857142857142857
2135964,4,B0002XL2KW,"The second season of ""Land of the Lost"" was in many ways the best season. The Marshalls had settled in and made real beds, cooking utensils, knives, even fishing poles. Sure, the special effects were still cheesy and some things were left unexplained - like how did the Marshalls keep their clothes so clean and unwrinkled when they wore them 24 hours a day (even sleeping in them) and how did Holly manage to braid her hair so perfectly every day.  But cheesiness was part of the fun of ""Land of the Lost"" and there were some truly outstanding episodes in the second season. The Zarn, a creature made out of lights that changed colors depending on his emotions appeared in several episodes and was a great addition to the show. One outstanding episode is ""One of Our Pylons is Missing"" in which Chaka, Holly, and Rick fall through a hole in the ground into what is basically the heart of the Land of the Lost. This episode shows how good the show was for a Saturday morning low budget kid's show. Other very good episodes include ""The Musician"" and ""Blackout"".

As with the first season, the bonus features are also good, especially when Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman (Will and Holly) do the commentating. Eure also hosts a fun trivia quiz based on the first two seasons. The interview with Walker Edminston (Enik) was very interesting, especially when he talks about how uncomfortable the Sleestak outfits were and why Enik wore a vest in each episode.

The second season of ""Land of the Lost"" is great nostalgic fun.",1161043200,4,1519,4.639405204460966
2135965,3,B0002XL2KW,"Although the special effects were improved for season two, the stories were not quite as strong as in season one. I did enjoy some of these episodes, especially The Pylon Express. And listening to the commentary on The Longest Day may have been worth the price of the DVD set alone.

If you enjoyed Land of the Lost or want to share it with your own children, I'd recommend Seasons One and Two.",1148774400,8,394,4.397260273972603
2135966,5,B0002XL2KW,"I've been waiting for literally two decades to see these episodes again.  Buying the first four episodes of ""Land of the Lost"" on a bootleg VHS at a science fiction convention in Chicago in 1996 only worsened my pain -- the first jolt of seeing those special effects that I loved as a kid, rendered fuzzy and cheezy-looking in glorious nth-generation NTSC-o-vision, made me almost regret loving this show as a bespectacled 6 year-old.  These DVDs provided much needed salvation, and made me again recapture the awe I felt watching the earthquake strike the Marshalls' tiny raft in the opening credits when I was six.

What helps make ""Land of the Lost"" essential viewing even now is the care with which these DVD sets have been put together.  These episodes look great all cleaned up, bearing in mind that most of us only ever saw them on non-cable TV in the 1970s or on UHF in the 1980s.  The DVD producers have added lively commentary tracks on five of the episodes, the best of which feature Will (Wesley Eure) and Holly (Kathy Coleman) all grown up.  They alternate their tracks singing the theme tune, praising each other's non-Emmy caliber performances, and making fun of some of the less plausible moments in each story.  Eure also hosts an interactive trivia game on the final disc.

Not only do these discs perfectly recapture the nostalgia value on ""Land of the Lost"", and celebrate the now cheezy look of the model dinosaurs and the old school chroma-key overlays, but they do something else: they display just how much thought went into the scripts for these children's shows.

Think about it: ""Land of the Lost"" Season 1, script edited by ""Star Trek""'s David Gerrold, brilliantly introduced the audience to a world of dinosaurs, reptilian Sleestaks, and missing-link hominid Pakuni.  Season 2 continues the trend of strong SF scripts, but also goes a step further, by growing the characters and revealing more mysteries.  We learn more about the Sleestak and more about the Pakuni; more about the mysterious Pylons that regulate day, night, entry and exit into the Land.  The Marshalls have more tools and more luxuries, and the characters of Will and Holly are both seen to mature.  They're even learning how to speak Pakuni, the language designed just for the show (and this is before America learned Klingonese).

Character growth from season to season on a low-budget kids' show in the mid 1970s.  Amazingly, this show was able to do some of the same things that ""Lost"" does so incredibly well for adults in prime time right now.  I'm so glad I have all of this show on DVD, and my older nephew, almost six himself, has just a few months left before he too enters the Land of the Lost.",1133136000,11,2702,4.7414529914529915
2135967,5,B0002XL2KW,"With the second season of Land of the Lost it is easy to scream `decline in quality'.  The great DC Fontana was no longer script editor, there were only 13 episodes, and there were no writers of note, save for legendary Theodore Sturgeon.  The decline in quality, of course, was happily not the case.  Sure, the hard science may have taken a bit of a back seat, but there was still much to be enjoyed.  A new, character, Zarn, was introduced who was made up entirely of light (and windchimes!).  Watch for his spaceship-it's all light as well!  A special feature of each one of these episodes that is always impressive is how it tries to teach something to the viewer, presumably a child viewer.  With the Sleestak episodes, a lesson about the scientific side of human nature (thinking, reasoning, etc.) is usually given; with the Pakuni, we learn about the more instinctual side of being human; with pylon (and sometimes Sleestak) episodes we usually learn a little bit of science.  Episodes worth watching again:  ""The Zarn""-an unforgettable and bitter-sweet first introduction of another recurring character; ""One of Our Pylons is Missing""-a wonderful episode about being dangerously trapped in an alternate dimension (very worthy of a former Twilight Zone episode); ""Gravity Storm/The Babysitter""-these two episodes reveal more . . . and nothing . . . about Zarn where it seems to be implied (also with Enik to a certain extant) that with more evolution comes more progress, but always at a cost and sacrifice of something, in this case humanity and compassion; ""Black Out""-in plunging the Land of the Lost into eternal darkeness, the Sleestak learn a valuable lesson in cause and effect in regards to their ecosystem, a lesson that is extremely pertinent today!  As for the extras, it almost seems that with less episodes you get less extras.  With the commentary tracks, there is also a good interview with Walker Edmiston, the voice and actor behind the many of unforgettable characters throughout the Kroffts' various shows.  Wesley Eure gamely hosts the Season 2 Land of the Lost Quiz, and offers some trivia for each answer.  With the second season of the Land of the Lost, it was full steam ahead for the series, even if it was only 13 episodes.  Viewed today, these episodes still beat anything on Saturday morning television these days hands down.",1120521600,8,2360,4.91183879093199
2135968,5,B0002XL2KW,"The creators of this show had the good sense not to tamper with what worked, and kept the series more or less in its original form.

It also added The Zarn, and some really cool sets.  The Pakuni language developed farther, and both Cha-Ka and the Marshalls are developing some ability with each others' languages.  There is more exposition on the lives of the Pakuni and the Sleestack, and less proselytizing than in Season 1.

Season 2 has the best cast commentaries, too.",1115337600,4,474,4.674698795180723

I was prepared for a poorer quality video, given the age of this.  There's only so much you can do to fix that.  What I wasn't prepared for (but should have been) is the really, really bad ""special effects"".  I didn't really notice it as a kid, and didn't think about it till I saw these.

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to have them to see in order, especially the ones I missed, but it's not a situation where I'll want to rewatch, so off to the twins.  I think it's a great show for their ages anyway.  Much better than the slap-together stuff I see sometimes these days.
