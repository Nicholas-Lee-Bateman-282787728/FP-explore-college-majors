4911626,1,B00600SPG0,"Okay first off if you are not a cheesy horror buff you will probably not like this movie. The main reason i liked this movie was because of the great 3D effects it had in it. Seeing it was shot in 3D seemed like a win all around and i was very excited for this to come out on 3D blu-ray. The problem is there is no news of this being released right now on 3D only 2D. I can not begin to tell you all the great effects you are being robbed of by not offering a 3D version of this film. The movie itself was very plain and generic and is like a kiddie up version of piranhas in 3D. (except shark night had even better 3D effects.)

I really don't get why you would shoot a movie in 3D and then not even sell it as a 3D movie. I still feel bad for all those who haven't been able to see avatar or legends in 3d. these flicks where ment to be shot this way and so did shark night......IN 3D!!!!  I know 3D isn't for every one but some movies really have benefited from the technology and this movie is a good example.",1320883200,17,1013,3.8653846153846154
4911627,2,B00600SPG0,"You are stranded on an island surrounded by treacherous sharks and no way to get out, before your eyes your friends are being eaten alive and there is no way to find help. You know that you will not get out alive and you know that you will be shredded to pieces by a hungry, viscous shark. The movie Shark Night is extremely intense and can change people's opinions on sharks very quickly and make them deathly afraid of water. Is this movie worth the risk? No. This movie is absolutely horrible and the bad special effects and dumb plot ruined the movie for everyone. If you're looking for a horrible movie to watch, Shark Night is the movie for you but if you want to get your money worth save yourself and don't buy a ticket to Shark Night.
 The main character, Sara takes her friends to a lake house in the Louisiana Gulf for a ""fun"" vacation; little does she know that the island is surrounded by man-eating sharks. The movie starts out with a conflict when Malik got his arm bit off by a shark. There are many characters that get attacked in this movie and it keeps you intensely watching. When they were trying to get Malik to help blood was dripping out the boat into the water and the sharks found the boat as quick as the speed of light. The boat then had to go so fast that Maya flung out of the boat and was torn to pieces and eaten alive in front of her friends. The shark had bitten of the motor or the boat and it caught in flames after hitting a dock. By hearing the plot it seems pretty stupid and it was. Also, when you actually watch the movie it seems tremendously fake and makes you want to just not watch anymore.
 Malik was so upset that his girlfriend Maya had been killed and he was determined to kill that mad shark even if he only had one arm. Him and his friends had managed to kill the shark and were very proud. They were not going to go into the water anytime soon and a boat had showed up to the island and they thought help had finally arrived to them but they were wrong. At this point in the movie you don't think anything else could go bad but it does! The people who arrived in the boat were really bad guys and they were the ones who had put those deadly sharks into the lake in the first place to make money off of videos of people being eaten alive by sharks. Beth and Blake fell for the trap and went with the guys on the boat because they said they would bring them to safety and those two were done with the island. At this point there were only two people left on the island. Nick was being dangled above a shark tank by a chair and you will have to watch this terrible movie to find out what happens to Sara and Nick in the end.
 This movie really needed to have better special effects and people would have appreciated this movie much more. The sharks were extremely fake looking and it made people not even want to watch the movie. The whole movie was so fake because Malik would not have been able to lose that much blood and still survive for a long time. Also, when the boat exploded the fire looked so fake that it made people laugh. Since it was 3-D they could have done so much more to make this movie scarier and more creative but it seemed like there was no reason for it to be 3-D. Moreover, in one scene where Sara had to hold her breathe it had her hold her breathe for about 7 minutes and we all know that that is absolutely impossible. This movie sent out a really bad message about sharks too. Sharks don't usually randomly attack you if you're really close to the shore and your barley moving around in the water and also a shark cannot jump that far out of water. Shark Night made sharks look really bad and gave out bad information about sharks and the movie overall was really fake and it really brought down the ratings on this movie.
 Shark Night had a very dumb plot and the whole movie felt like it was just people getting attacked and it got very boring. Also, the movie was very predictable and had absolutely horrible special effects. Shark Night taught people fake information about sharks and put a stereotype on sharks. One of the biggest wastes of my money was on the movie, Shark Night  3-D.",1319673600,,4168,4.2180451127819545
4911628,4,B00600SPG0,"The acting is not stellar nor is the script flawless; however, the movie is very entertaining.  The sharks are really interesting and I would have liked to have seen more of them.  The reasoning why the sharks were in the water was a bit on the lame side but again we let that go because the sharks were interesting.  The relationship between the blonde girl and Dennis was rather sketchy because it wasn't really explained.  What he did to her was explained but why he did it wasn't really explained aside from him not wanting to loose her; however, it wasn't like he was in love with her...so the Dennis/heroine relationship was iffy.  Aside from that we really don't have any complaints about it except it needed more views of the sharks! It was fun watching this movie in the theatre because when the sharks would jump out of the water...the audience would jump too.",1319155200,,870,4.587096774193548
4911629,1,B00600SPG0,"You would think that filmmakers would use a movie with high production quality for the 3D movie effect, but no. As for the pg 13 rating, it is not suitable for a young teen. The plot and script are so bad. Very stereotypical and predictable. My title says it all. I know people enjoy this type of stuff, for a mindless guilty pleasure.

4911630,5,B00600SPG0,"SHARK NIGHT 3D is a 2011 shark film directed by David R Ellis and starring Sara Paxton. This film was absolutely brilliant! The critics hated it, why? It was the best film i've ever seen and i'm not joking! Better than PIRANHA 3D and JAWS, although i know everyone else will disagree. The acting was brilliant. Sara Paxton, Dustin Milligan and Katharine Mcphee inparticular. The storyline was filled with suspense, laughs and underwater shocks! I couldn't believe how many parts made me jump as well! CREEPY!

Sara and her college friends decide to go up to her lakehouse after another year of hard work. It looks like it is going to be paradise, the perfect holiday. And then one of them, Malik, is attacked. With only one arm, he and several of the others set off to take him to hospital. They are stopped by another shark. What is happening? Why are there sharks in a lake?

The 3D was awesome! The best 3D i've ever seen! The sharks looked extremely realistic and the pace was quick and exciting! Perhaps not the goriest shark film ever, but there is still some blood and guts to enjoy. Anyway, who cares? Jaws wasn't that gory, and that's a classic! Just because the critics hated SHARK NIGHT 3D doesn't mean you shouldn't see it! Great acting! Great storyline and brilliant effects! AWESOME! 10/10!",1317340800,,1304,4.665217391304348
4911631,4,B00600SPG0,"DISCLAIMER: I saw this in 2D.

The movie opens up similar to ""Jaws"" where the girl dies (oops sorry about the early spoiler). There were some differences. The music wasn't as intense, it was broad daylight, it was a shallow water attack, it was in fresh water,and we don't see a dorsal fin until later in the film. A group of college students, including a top athlete prospect (Sinqua Walls) who wants to be monogamous head up to the Sara's (Sara Paxton) lake/gulf house for the weekend. We know they are going to encounter 3D sharks, but in addition they meet with some uncouth sexist men who should be belong in a slasher film. Nick (Dustin Milligan) has interest in Sara, but hasn't made his move.

The dialouge was fairy decent. It wasn't predictable and at times had the classic ""indy"" freshness to it along with some modern pop music. After the first shark attack (you knew it was coming) we discover they have no cell phone reception...then there is the mishap with their boat. What to do for a shark attack? Stay out of the water. Humans have the advantage on land, believe it or not. But that doesn't make for a good shark horror movie so we add the twist. This is not just any shark. This is a movie shark. It can swim miles in a matter of moments. It appears to go out of its way to hunt humans, even leaping out of the water to get them.

The shark special effects didn't seem that great, perhaps viewing in 3D would make them better. The movie had a few slow scenes needed to establish relationships and character. We find out Sara is a survivor out of a different horror movie. The acting was on par for B movies. Dialogue slightly better. Soundtrack slightly better.

Rear nudity, sexual situations, language.",1315699200,2,1724,4.498402555910543

4911633,5,B00600SPG0,"Shark Night 3D was not what i was expecting at all. I thought it was going to be like Piranha 3D but that was not the case. Shark Night 3D took a different route and it worked, very suspenseful. I really enjoyed the movie. The 3D was AMAZING!! the sharks looked so real it was freaky. The hammerhead in particular looked so real that combined with the 3D element i felt as though i was face to face with the shark and it gave me some chills. I'am hoping for a sequel so in the meantime i will wait for its blu-ray release. I recommend for you all to see it :)",1315612800,9,559,4.0
4911634,1,B00600SPG0,"I don't care what anyone says, but I LOVE Final Destination movies...all of them!
Shark movies never really work (besides Jaws, of course). So I had high hopes for this one since it was directed by the Final Destination Director. But what a disappointment!
It was just so badly done that I don't even know how to start. You probably read other reviews and know about the bad things about it. But what kills me the most is; 1-How much someone can do with only one arm(and after losing so much blood), 2- A bad guy with shark teeth(C'mon!), and  3- The HORRIBLE acting( the Sheriff).
Like another reviewer said, Piranha 3D was way more fun to watch...with more gore and naked girls(NO boobies here).

If you wanna watch a really stupid shark movie and have way more fun, watch ""Mega Giant Shark Vs. Giant Octopus"".",1315526400,,812,4.554794520547945
4911635,2,B00600SPG0,"Let me start this review with an honest observation. Creature features, while fun, are rarely scary. A big lumbering shark in the water or a snake in the grass is scary in reality but always falls flat for me on the big screen. While I do agree with the general consensus that ""Jaws"" is the rare creature feature that works, I have to say that the rest have done little thrill me. It is with this honest trepidation that I went to see ""Shark Night 3D"". ""Shark Night 3D"" is the latest creature feature to use both creatures in the water and 3D to lumbering effect. Neither is new or revolutionary. Sorry to say it but ""Jaws 3D"" beat you to the punch about thirty years ago.

Anyway, on to ""Shark Night 3D"" and what a treat this movie is. Set in Louisiana, seven Tulane undergraduates - Sara (Sarah Paxton), Nick (Dustin Milligan), Beth (Katharine McPhee), Malik (Sinqua Walls), Maya (Alyssa Diaz), Blake (Chris Zylka) and Gordon (Joel David Moore) - drive to Sara's family vacation home on a secluded private lake near Lake Pontchartrain. At a local bait shop, Sara encounters her old boyfriend, Dennis (Chris Carmack) and his friend, Red (Joshua Leonard). Dennis and Red make racial taunts to Malik and Maya, his Latina fiance, but Sara diffuses the situation. Sara drives a speedboat recklessly to the vacation home, attracting the attention of Sheriff Sabin (Donal Logue). He chases her, frightening her friends, but then happily shares a beer with them. He tells Sara he is happy to see her back after a three-year- long absence.

While Gordon tries to seduce Beth and Sara sunbathes, Nick, Blake, Malik and Maya go waterskiing. A shark pursues Malik and attacks him. Nick, Blake and Maya try to rescue him, but he swims back to shore - missing his right arm. When Nick swims out into the lake to retrieve his arm, he is stalked and pursued by the shark. Nick barely makes it back to shore. A medical student, he stabilizes Malik, then goes with Sara and Maya to take him to a hospital. However, blood dripping from Malik's wound attracts a shark that attacks the boat. Maya is knocked into the water and eaten. The shark then damages the steering column of the boat. It crashes into the gas pump in front of the boathouse, exploding and stranding everyone. Sara, Nick and Malik barely make it to shore. Because their cell phones have no reception and the house has no landline, they cannot call for help. Blah, blah, blah.

""Shark Night 3D"" is everything that a horror movie shouldn't be. It's PG-13, it's loaded from beginning to end with grating pop/R&B songs, its 3D looks like crap, and the characters are so cookie cutter boring that you won't care who lives or who dies. I would say that you want them all to be shark bait but once you've seen one awful shark attack in this film, you'll feel like you've seen them all. Add to this a ridiculous third act twist that makes little sense (seriously, watch the movie and tell me how it is even POSSIBLE for the redneck hillbillies to do what they did) and some of the most implausible events I've ever seen in a movie and you've got one of the worst movies of the year.

Though, truth be told, it is comforting to know that if someone loses an arm in a giant lake, you can easily find it in dirty water by swimming out from your lake without a mask or goggles. After this, while locating said lost arm, you can also spot a bloodthirsty shark. When you see said shark, you can out swim it even though it can overtake a speeding boat with someone skiing behind. Did that just make your brain hurt? Ugh. Join the club. Last year's ""Piranha 3D"" was dumb, harmless fun. This movie doesn't deserve a theatrical run, hell it doesn't even deserve to be played on Syfy.",1315267200,,3716,4.525297619047619

This little gem may have slipped by getting added to our librarys DVD section if I hadnt pulled it off the donation cart. How someone could give up this gem, Im not sure, but Im glad they did because I, and numerous library patrons, will now be able to enjoy it.

Nerds, Jocks and Hot Girls all get along together, which is nice to see. Then you have the typical redneck, which of course you will find on the way to your giant lake house that has no neighbors close by. Once we get to the house, thats when the mangling and dismembering begins. What they think of as a freak thing, (the shark must have came through the levy after hurricane season), quickly turns into sharks everywhere.

The sheriff (who plays Harvey on Gotham love that crazy show), adds some comic relief as the bumbling country bumpkin. Very little nudity, and no sex, just lots and lots of blood. The final reason as to why this is happening makes sense in a twisted way. And honestly Im surprised something like this hasn't happened in real life or maybe it has.

4911683,1,B00600SPG0,"I didn't realize how much I hated this movie until I actually sat down and started to write this review. ""Shark Night"" feebly attempts to cash in on many better shark movies dating all the way back to ""Jaws"". I saw ""Jaws"". This is no ""Jaws"". Eight self-absorbed unlikeable college students (At least I think there were eight: it doesn't matter anyway....) and their very cute dog go to a creepy, redneck-infested island with no cellphone coverage for a getaway. What could possibly go wrong? (See title.)

You may find this hard to believe, but the two racist rednecks with itchy trigger fingers aren't the most annoying characters in the film; that role goes to the slacker gamer. I couldn't wait for a shark to masticate him. The hot blonde who used to hail from these parts and knew the rednecks in question (and even used to have a thing with one of them) is Sara (Sara Paxton). Her performance is ghastly, but it's equaled by leading man Nick (Dustin Milligan) who is a better actor, but can't do much with the Pablum he's been given here. The idiot sheriff is on call if need be, so the crew gets down to water skiing and terrible musical montages. Sit back and enjoy a lot of waterskiing, you know how super entertaining that is. Oh, wait. No it's not. (Pro tip: keep the fast forward button handy.) Malik (Sinqua Walls) is the first to receive a traumatic injury when he loses his arm while skiing. Malik is (besides the dog) the most likeable character in the film so this is disappointing. Don't worry though, he gets to hang on an unrealistic amount of time and has an unreasonable number of things happen to him in the process. There's lots of padding that is interminable. (The cellphones don't work! Don't use the landline or go for help; emote about the cellphones!) Malik's arm removal causes a blithering idiocy epidemic among the college students who lose their collective brain cells with ridiculous arguments and nonsensical interpersonal conflicts while Malik still has spurting arterial blood. My favorite part of the movie was the dive into shark-infested waters to retrieve Malik's arm. This goes surprisingly better than you might expect.

Of course people get knocked out of boats, off wave runners, eaten, etc., by CGI sharks that range from actually pretty good to utterly ridiculous. Please enjoy the gratuitous boat explosion scene (The throttle's jammed!) and a stunning scene in which one-armed and bloody Malik wades into the lake at night to hunt sharks with a spear. He kills a hammerhead. No, really.

I was grateful that ""Shark Night"" was short, but it's not short enough. Stuff happens for a while (sharks pick people off of trees, people swim well after being shot, etc.) and then the real plot comes floating into view like a gob of sputum on a placid pond. It turns out the rednecks and the sheriff are stocking the lake with various sharks to make shark snuff videos for a very selective audience. Ponder that for just a minute. The cast just makes convenient fish food. The sheriff explains: ""It's all moral relativism!"" (That is something you might not expect to hear from this character, who probably didn't finish junior high school.) Sara and Nick struggle against all odds, and thanks to some incendiary footwork by Nick combined with the sheriff's love of classic heavy metal, there's another hostage situation in which everyone in the cast except the rednecks gets a chance to display they have no idea to hold a gun. Here's a puzzler: why are the victims locked in shark cages before they are put in the water? You know, those sturdy metal devices that keep the sharks away from people? Just curious, but never mind, there's a climax to rush to. We learn the rednecks are not only evil but purely diabolical when they put the dog in the lake for the sharks. The fiends! Not to fear, because the dog saves the day. I am absolutely not making this up. You probably thought this would end up with the best looking boy and girl in the cast surviving and everyone else dying, and I wouldn't dream of spoiling it for you, but you're probably very close. I was just glad the dog made it out alive.

I hated everything about this movie. I have seen a lot of shark movies, some of them good and some of them terrible, but they are mostly enjoyable on some level. I didn't like anything about ""Shark Night"" from the opening frame: the acting is bad, the characters are irritating and thoroughly unlikeable (Malik conditionally excepted), and the plot and pacing are boring. I very rarely give a shark movie one star, but for ""Shark Night"" I will gladly make an exception.",1456185600,4,4612,4.683107274969174

4911687,4,B00600SPG0,"Friday the 13th with sharks.

That pretty much sums up the plot for Shark Night 3D. It's the tried-and-true formula of putting a group of young adults in an isolated wilderness environment and then slaughtering them one by one, either by a maniac in a hockey mask or, in this particular case, big fish with teeth and a ravenous appetite. If you understand that's what you're in for going in to things, then Shark Night 3D won't disappoint.

The mayhem is all quite competently staged. Director David R. Ellis knows what looks good on camera and even in that most dubious of cinematic blessings, 3D. Ellis has some unique visual tricks up his sleeve and the movie is colorfully and atmospherically shot. The shark attacks that are at the core of the story are well-done, although some horror fans may be let down by the relative lack of gorethis is, after all, a PG-13 film, and the carnage therefore a bit restrained. Still, the numerous shark attacks usually pack a surprising punch and the proceedings are certainly not devoid of blood, if that's your thing. Moreover, the 3D effects are put to pretty good use, and in a number of scenes garishly fanged shark snouts seem to swim right out of the screen at you. Nice.

The cast seems to be having a good time and everybody does a professional job. Of course, the script doesn't tell us much about most of the characters, who exist primarily to be eaten by the voracious sharks, but at least none of them are totally unlikeable The story's protagonists are Sara (played by the very hot Sarah Paxton) and her potential boyfriend, Nick (Dustin Milligan), and we do get to learn a little more about them. Sara is troubled by something that happened four years ago, something that has perhaps come back to haunt her once more, and Nick is a shy, rather nerdy medical student with a seemingly hopeless crush on Sara. Both actors are charismatic and create characters it's easy to identify with.

Shark Night 3D isn't food for deep thought, but if you like b-movies and can appreciate their unique charms, then this is a very fun movie. It doesn't compare well to Jaws or even the more recent thriller The Reef, but then it's really not built to compete with those films. This movie's role model is something more along the lines of, you guessed it, Friday the 13th. And for what it's worth, I think Jason Voorhees would be proud.",1438041600,,2375,4.62085308056872

My little cuz is the person I most often watch all the animated films with, makes sense since she is a kid. But at four or five [wish I could remember] she started getting interested in sharks, shark movies in particular. It was weird because what little kid is into seeing sharks eat people alive, but she liked them. So as the years have gone by I have watched just as many crazy shark films as I have animated ones. So when this one went to theaters and was also in 3-D I knew she would want to go. So my brother and I grabbed her from school that Friday and took her to see it. Naturally she loved it.

Seven friends from college are getting together for a getaway at one of the friends family vacation house. That is plan as they know it, just a good time at a nice house and water, what more could a young person need. Well things go horribly wrong when one of them is attacked by something I the water. Now they have to find a way to get him to the hospital in which the only way is to get him a flight there, but they are stuck. Now with time running out and crazy locals running about what will they do, and oh yeah there are sharks.

Now I will say that this is far from a perfect movie but she absolutely loved it. I will admit that I enjoyed it as well. I have always been a fan of the killer shark flicks and being able to see another on the big screen was excellent. Add in that this was in 3-D and all three of us had a great time watching this. I  really liked the little rap video that the cast did after the credits were over. The cast was good and made for nice young bodies for the sharks. Over all it was a good, pointless, fun flick. The DVD comes with two bonus features but I wish it would have had a commentary. Any way this was a fun flick and gets five stars from me for the good time we had with our little cuz.",1396742400,3,1852,3.9571045576407506

My main problem with the film is the PG-13 rating which means it doesn't deliver on any sex/nudity or that much violence/gore which does hurt the film. Another problem is the CG sharks, they are certainly not the worst CG but they are definitely not the best. Shockingly, I actually recognized some of the cast such as Joel David Moore(Hatchet, Dodgeball), Sara Paxton(The Last House on the Left Remake), Donal Logue(Grounded For Life, Max Payne), and the main guy Dustin Milligan looked a little familiar but I couldn't place him in a movie I have seen before.

Another good thing at least to me is that Shark Night is pretty fast paced. There is a supposed twist in the film but it is absolutely stupid and predictable. I don't know if I would recommend Shark Night for purchase but if you Netflix Watch Instantly then I say check it out if you like Creature Feature movies.

4911742,2,B00600SPG0,"A weekend escape turns deadly for a group of college students when they encounter a group of man-eating sharks in the waters surrounding their remote island getaway! Make no mistake about it, the PG-13 rating for SHARK NIGHT clearly designates both the intended audience and the level of intelligence behind the script. Every attempt to make this movie ""hip"" for the younger generations instead comes off as being trite and cliche, and every move the characters make is utterly predictable... That is, up until the ridiculous final act. Technology has apparently devolved once again, considering that the computerized sharks in SHARK NIGHT look worse than those created 13 years ago in DEEP BLUE SEA. It is also sad to think that a film like this could ever have made it in to theaters, when the quality of the overall production falls behind many of the awful made-for-TV movies that drown the SyFy channel yearly. At least with the 2010 PIRANHA remake, Alexandre Aja knew enough to play up the high camp in the picture, and delivered an abusive amount of gore. There is no fun to be had anywhere in SHARK NIGHT, and it is nearly bloodless. Do not waste your time on this pathetic film.

This should have been campy matine gold.

Instead, it just seemed like 90 minutes of missed opportunities.

Instead of reaching to push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating like the screenwriters seemed to consciously forgo scares, laughs or, you know, showing any sharks and focus on the repercussions of a particularly insipid high school romance.  Ninety minutes of potential thrills turns into 90 minutes of stifling yawns.

Rented it, already expecting a tragedy of movie. After all, the director behind this one was the same of SNAKES ON A PLANE. But I expected aGOOD traged, one that at least would make me laugh. I did not expect lots of gore or something like that, I just wanted some good old ""so bad it's godd"" kind of movie.

But this kind of movie is tricky to be made... So the result is that SHARK NIGHT is just bad.

The plot does not make a whole lot of sense. Ok, bad guys (no, terrible, really terrible bad guys!) release a lot of diffrent shark species in a lake, with the sole purpose of selling/uploading images on the Web of the said sharks trearing people to pieces.. Wosh, talk about bad guys... But, how on Earth would these guys expect to cover their tracks after killing more than seven young people in one single day?!!

Another uncredible point was that they (probably on purpose, to keep tradition with the old cliche) killed the black character first! Another funny thing was that the leading lady, after things begin to go downhill, spends the whole movie, be it night or day, dressed in a tiny bikini (gorgeous girl, by the way).

And the sharks themselves. Ok, the bad guys throw sharks into the lake to make their evil deeds. But movie never ever gives one single hint about why some of them are Hulk-sharks, jumping feets above the water and swallowing some people whole. Where did come that power? At least in the movie with Thomas Jane (DEEP BLUE SEA) that explanation for the sharks agression, velocity and power is that they were genetically altered, something like that.

All in all, this is one classic movies of ""so bad, it's really bad"".",1351209600,,1663,4.5083056478405314

4911752,2,B00600SPG0,"Perhaps ""Shark Night 3D"" has been released at the worst possible time - or maybe the right time. Anyone looking for the ridiculously gory horror (or comedy) of last year's ""Piranha 3D"" will be sorely disappointed with ""Shark Night,"" in which you will see neither gory kills nor nudities (interestingly, the film's producers include Chris Briggs and Mike Fleiss, co-producers of ultra-gory ""Hostel""). As a ""Jaws""-inspired thriller, ""Shark Night"" is also tame and weak. In short, the film is only mildly amusing, with nothing new to add to the genre, except the silliest storyline you've ever heard before.

The film is about seven college students including Sara Palski (Sara Paxton) on vacation staying at the fancy lake house owned by Sara's family. When one of the boys gets severely wounded, they realize that there is a shark in the lake. Yes, sharks in the lake. OK, the film is helmed by David R. Ellis, director of ""Snakes on a Plane,"" a much better (and equally silly) thriller starring Samuel L. Jackson.

Usually, people have just to stay out of the water to avoid the shark attacks. In ""Shark Night,"" Sara and other college students are not allowed to do that because of the stupid reason I will not reveal here. Anyway, the film as a thriller is too safe and straightforward. If only this film showed something different, as Alexandre Aja did in his knowingly campy piranha movie, ""Shark Nigh"" would be much fun.

Director David R. Ellis has done much better jobs in his tongue-in-cheek thriller ""Final Destination 2"" and ""Snakes on a Plane."" In ""Shark Night"" he simply moves one scene to another, not knowing what to do with the material he is given to. Even the ""climax"" sequence that is obviously inspired by a Spielberg film ""Shark Night"" is mostly a joyless ride, not much fun throughout.",1342742400,,1805,4.816129032258065
4911753,3,B00600SPG0,"I was actually really excited to see this flick when I heard of it, then the PG-13 rating kind of lowered my expectations but I still gave it a shot. While I must say, the 3D was great, so great I went back and saw this movie 3 more times (during it's theatrical run) and was still satisfied, though more and more bored during each viewing. I was lucky enough to win a copy of this gem on BluRay, so I didn't spend a dime on this movie, which is a good thing because I hardly watch it anymore. While I do love the movie, it gets old quick. The characters all seem to blend into eachother like a very watery painting or something, and let's face it, their acting isn't the best either. The movie has decent effects, though there wasn't much to give effects for. This movie is absolutely blood-less. Unless you count the tinted red water, then it's as if these characters don't bleed when chomped on. The CGI isn't the best, either, but it's definitely not the worst. I don't know, I've got mixed feelings for this flick. You either love it or you hate it.",1341273600,,1054,4.275
4911754,2,B00600SPG0,"Excuse the poor heading, Shark Night was a weak film overall. A group of college students go to a lake house to party and end up being the prey of deadly sharks. The story is generally generic even when the twist occurs; I personally thought the second half of the movie brought down the film the most since the first half was decent. It has some exhilarating scenes that were actually fun, but only SOME scenes really worked. I ended up hating most of the characters and the survivors are predictable from the beginning. The acting was okay, I personally thought Sara Paxton did a better job in The Innkeepers. The effects were also weak. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a horror movie because it wasn't scary at all.

This movie has some gore, blood, and partial nudity (male and female). It kind of pushes the PG-13 rating, I've seen tamer R-rated films. Overall, I don't recommend paying for this film. If you must watch it, it's  available on Netflix Streaming as of 6/22/12.",1340323200,,988,4.544943820224719
4911755,4,B00600SPG0,"Since I watched this movie on Netflix, I am counting that as an instant que for it.  Now with that being said, let me start off by saying usually in horror films either the hero/heros or the monster/monsters end up dying.  It was that way in all the Nightmare on Elm Street's, Friday the 13th's, the Halloweens, the Children Of The Corns, Wrong Turns, and Texas Chainsaw Massacres.  Shark Night wasn't one of those horrors, in fact not only was it not one of those horrors, but it was also the first horror film about sharks I've seen where all the sharks don't die.  And as a person who has loved sharks since he could walk, I can respect that tremendously.  In my opinion it's sad that films about sharks that are horrors have sharks either eating people or being killed by people to save them selves because there are 350 different species of shark and only 6 of them eat people.  And those 6 species usually don't attack people in the open water unless they mistake a person for something their not, which I might add rarely happens.

Anyways first off I will give credit where credit is due, this movie did not have good actor's or actress's in it and the creators of this film could have thrown in allot more blood, gore, shark attack scenes, and species of shark that do eat people such as the Tiger Shark and the short and long fin Mako Sharks to make it a better movie.  And lets just face the facts Joel David Moore (best known for playing Owen in the film Dodge Ball) who was 34 when the film was made shouldn't be playing a college student in a group of people in their early to mid 20's playing his fellow students at Tulane University even though Gordon the character played by Moore is an older college student on a 7 year program.  Giving American Idol contestant Katharine McPhee her third shot at a movie may not have been the best idea even though the creators of the movie killed 2 bricks with one stone on McPhee for both the people who did and didn't like her performance on American Idol since she is ate by sharks in the movie.  The sharks in the movie especially the Bull Sharks could have been made more believable and realistic with less CGI animation in terms of their looks as well as how they attack the people.  And in one scene involving a music request a college student request Guns N Roses when clearly the worlds ""Dokken ""Into The Fire"" instead of Guns N' Roses would have fit the scene better.  But all in all Shark Night is a good movie, the plot was great and the shark attack scenes really wern't that bad.  Plus not all of the college students who are basically the good guys in the film die.  And best of all only 2 of the many sharks (one from what I could see seemed to be a smooth hammerhead the other defenitally a great white) in the film die (that's less then the amount of college students who die in the film).

And just for the record, if you're wondering what is pretty much incorrect about the shark species in the movie there are really only 2 things aside from them attacking people in a manor they would not in reality:
1. The Cookiecutter shark-First off, the Cookiecutter shark would never be able to get anywhere near where it was to the surface in the movie Shark Night and secondly in the movie they made it seem like the Cookiecutter shark burrowed it's way into the skin of its prey like a few parasite catfish in the Amazon Rain Forest do.  The Cookiecutter shark uses its over sized teeth to cut large chunks out of its prey making them look like they have a cookie cut out of them.  And they've been known to get a bit larger then they were in the movie.

2. The Sand Tiger Shark-Sand Tiger Sharks are not really that aggressive of a shark in reality and they do not eat people.  In the movie Shark Night the Sand Tiger Shark is portrayed more as a man eating aggressive shark similar to an actual Tiger Shark.",1338163200,,3876,4.33609958506224

4911760,3,B00600SPG0,"I really wanted to hate this movie. All I could think when I saw the ads for it on TV were that it was a movie made solely to promote the new 3-D craze which I haven't been caught up in, a combination of that technology with a rip off twist of JAWS. While I was right in some ways, the movie offers more than I expected. It's a campy classic that will have you jumping at times while laughing at others. In short, this could make a great party film.

The story opens with a shark attack on a small lake in Louisiana that is nearly identical to the opening shark attack in JAWS except it takes place in daylight. The film then moves to a group of college students about to head to the lake for a weekend getaway at the home of affluent Sara.

They get to the lake fine and then discover that to get to her home they have to take a speedboat to her island. Along the way they're chased by the local sheriff for speeding but it turns out it's all in good fun since he and Sara have been having this race for years now.

Settling in they go out for some fun on the water only to confront tragedy. Football star Malik falls from a ski board but when they go back to find him they discover his arm missing. Med student Nick does his best to stop the blood flow while one of the others blames him for a boating accident. But to quote Richard Dreyfuss ""this was no boating accident!"" Instead we find a shark on the lake. A shark big enough to take off Malik's arm. When Nick dives back in to see if he can find him, he nearly runs into the same shark and has to abandon the arm.

Stuck on the island with no cell phone reception, the group tries to handle Malik as best they can. They try to get off the island using the boat but are attacked again which results in the boat being blown up and one of them, Malik's girlfriend, being eaten. This results in one of those so over the top moments that make it hilarious as Malik, arm missing and stump tied off, gets out of bed and wades into the water with a spear hoping to take on the shark. He does get attacked and kills the shark, but they discover this isn't the same shark.

They begin firing flares into the sky in the hopes that someone will see them and come to the island. Hope arrives in the form of Sara's old boyfriend, a boy she accidentally scarred with a propeller blade years ago. But things aren't always what they seem.

I won't blow the surprise (which is extremely far fetched) as to why the sharks are here but they are tremendous, a great combination of CGI and puppetry that work together to make a more or less believable bad guy. Some of the scenes that play for scares are frightening and funny at the same time. One of the kids is out on a jet ski heading for help with Malik tied to the back of the seat when a shark leaps out of the water in front of him to take him off the ski, a nice snack.

This movie obviously wasn't made to be taken seriously. It was made to showcase the 3-D effects and to have fun. While we have bikini clad babes here none of them appear nude so that's stunning in a Hollywood movie in itself. It leaves us with a movie that while gory can be safely seen by most pre-teens. The movie is fun, funny, frightening and a blast. At first it seems like a movie nothing more than an excuse to pad a soundtrack with driving and boating sequences that last too long. But once the sharks arrive it becomes a seriously fun intentional grade B horror fest. Maybe you won't want to own it, but it is definitely worth renting for a night.",1332806400,3,3521,4.109011627906977

The rural locals here are once again uniformly and stereotypically depraved.

Plot: seven college kids are on a vacation to one of their friends' houses which happens to be on a lake. But after a freak accident involving a water skier and a bull shark (whom looses an arm) they soon seek help from two townsfolk, one of which is the house owners ex-boyfriend.... while on their way two of the seven kids soon realize that these lowlifes have opened the door for all of these carnivorous sharks such as the Cookiecutter, the Hammerhead, the Sand Tiger, the Bull, the Mako, and the Great White and that they are attempting to make snuff movies to gather up mucho money (which I don't know how they would because like faces of death, it may be banned in forty six countries)... who will survive the day, the night, and the dawn of the sharks!

Review: I was so pumped after seeing the trailer to this movie for the first time but like most others.... I saw the MPAA rating, then I saw the movie... don't get me wrong... the movie was a little over decent but just the lack of gore was upsetting me..... I will start this review out positive though by saying that this is the first shark film to use a Cookiecutter Shark which, in my opinion is a homage to Piranha 3D due to the fishes size. I adored the fact that they had a clever yet sinister reason to feed people to the sharks! The best part out of the whole movie experience was when the kids were walked out by there parents with there hands over their eyes... but the worst and most uncreative/unoriginal part though was during the opening credits when the showed a shark from deep blue sea in plane sight! There were a few scary parts I will admit like when a character was trying to swim away and you'd expect him to get dragged under and eaten in a PG-13 fashion but no, instead he climbs up a near by tree and waits.... the shark then jumps and a grabs him and eats him... in a PG-13 fashion. I swear but refuse to accept especially for this day and age that I heard the shark roar when it was attacking the cage with Sarah Paxton inside, I refuse to believe because I like to think that it is just the cage making noise from being broken and bent. I will not be harsh on this movie because of it MPAA rating like many other people are but I will review, judge and rate it for the movie itself which I will admit takes itself a bit to serious and should've been more on a Piranha 3D level of seriousness.

Acting: It was decent, I mean it took some good actors + one singer and mashed them up but the problem was that it felt like they all played in different kinds of movies/TV shows.... the best actor was probably Joel David Moore because he was instead of a class clown the gamer clown who had goofy sense of humor!

Gore: A severed arm with minor blood, a lot of red water, a hole blown through a sharks head with some sort of weapon/gun, a bloodless stabbing and gunshot and that's pretty much it.... yes, I was upset with the rating but for a PG-13 rated flick I think it was pretty harsh and chummy... by PG-13 standards that is.

Bottom Line: I wish it came with an unrated version or at least a 3D release..... but I enjoy it for what it is... Terror has not gone deep and it will not be forgotten by me, if anything Terror has surfaced!

The acting is bad. The storyline is practically DOA. The CGI and puppet sharks try to give it a go but it never jumps.

A group of college students head out to a lakeside house in Louisiana for a break. While at a gas station, they have a momentary scrap with a couple lame-brained locals. Obviously these locals will play some further plot point later on in the story.

After stripping down to their swim wear, three of them go out on a boat for some water boarding. (Not the torture but you wouldn't know the difference at this point) The dude gets hit, from below, by a shark and loses his arm. Later he takes a spear out to the shallows in order to get him some revenge on the shark that kills his girlfriend.

But all-in-all, expect one or two of these ""kids"" to survive the shark attacks.

The story will try to explain why sharks are in a lake and why they have cameras attached to them.

I don't understand why every shark movie since Jaws has been dismal. It must be quite difficult to come up with a decent movie about shark attacks. Add to that the difficulty of creating realistic sharks and I doubt if we'll ever get a shark movie worth it's soup.

We eventually learn that the hillbillies have stocked the lake with many different breeds of shark in order to film people being eaten for a ""Faces of Death"" like movie they are preparing for a web show (I'd watch it).

Shark Night 3D is just so...dumb. The hillbillies are as stereotyped as they come (one is even named ""Red"") and the college kids are a bland mix of interchangeable actors. The director attempts to crow bar in some ""romance"" between the characters but you won't care because soon most of them will be chum anyway. The PG13 rating guarantees no boobs or gore so the entire fare ends up being a big tease. Even with padding the entire film is only 1:17 minutes long.",1326585600,30,1555,4.362068965517241

4911796,4,B00600SPG0,"Alright, first off, this is not Jaws.  In the long run this is probably one or two steps above one of those Shark Attack movies.  Still, as far as mindless entertainment goes, this one is a blast.

A bunch of kids get eaten by sharks while on a trip to a friend's summer house.  There is a twist to all this that I won't reveal, but it adds a nice little touch to the whole ordeal.  The acting isn't great, but it's not terrible either.  Everyone seems to get the movie they're in, and acts accordingly.  Katharine McPhee was the stand out for me.  She plays totally against type, and in the end, you actually end up liking her.  Sadly she doesn't get used nearly enough, and we are left with Sarah Paxton and Dustin Milligan, who both turn in good performances, but have two of the blander characters in the group.

Think of it this way.  The movie was directed by the same guy who did Snakes on a Plane.  The effects are mostly cheesy CG, and as far as this being a 3D movie?  You aren't missing much.  There are maybe two or three moments where something comes at the screen, which makes me think the 3D was an afterthought.  So don't be upset that there isn't a 3D edition out there.

Some people would say that the PG-13 holds this movie back.  I... don't agree.  This movie really doesn't need crazy blood and gore.  It also doesn't need any nudity (although there is a fairly well toned man butt on display...).  This is perfect TV movie fodder.  Throw it on when the weather isn't to great, and you just feel like sitting on the couch and turning off your mind.  It's a simple nature run amok thing with some well staged action, a nice dose of comedy, and a bunch of pretty people getting eaten by sharks.

4911798,3,B00600SPG0,"Ok, so this movie wasn't extremely original. There was nothing new or terribly exciting. Nerdy boy likes beautiful girl. Beautiful girl invites nerdy boy and other friends (from college, Tulane) to her lake home that she hasn't visited in 3 years. Beautiful girl's ex-boyfriend (Dennis) is a jerk and hangs out with a bigger jerk (Red). Beautiful girl and ex-boyfriend have a past that prevented her from coming home. There are some sharks (all varieties and all sizes) living in the salt water lakes surrounding her property (in the bayou).  Neither the beautiful girl or her friends (Sara, Nick, Malik, Maya, Blake or Beth), no matter how smart or savvy they are, seem to be aware of the danger they are in from these hungry predators. Of course we should already know from the cookie-cut formula that exists in these types of movies, that as the body count rises, there will be the usual events...for example, when you are in danger there will be no reception or cell service; you will trust someone that you shouldn't; and there will be a bad guy or guys (who should be obvious in this movie) who have some convoluted reasons for why they are doing what they are doing....who waste no time spelling it out for you while torturing someone;  not to mention the never-ending hope that we have that someone will survive. Personally I took this movie for what it was...mindless entertainment with some attempts at gore. While I didn't see the 3D version, and don't understand why there was one even made, I was entertained. While the plot loosely reminded me of other movies that involve murder-for-sport (Predator, Death Race, etc.) and animal gone bad movies (like Piranha, Jaws, Orca Killer Whale, etc), Shark Night was just plain fun. What more could you ask for, bad acting, an ok plot and decent (although there were some scenes that looked really computer generated) special effects?

Her legs are so nice.

Katherine McPhee also looked hot as hell, I am glad she went back to brunette and put on some weight, she looks so hot like she did when she first came out.

I have to say though that the part where the black kid cites ""West Baltimore Rules"" as his reason for walking into the water to take the sharks on in a street fight was funny as hell but made the guy seem really stereotypical.

Like SNAKES, its plot is incredulous, but one must admit snakes and sharks are frightening in their own right.  But JAWS will always be the ultimate shark movie and cheesy ones like MEGASHARK aren't trying to set any new standards.
SHARK NIGHT tries to be more like JAWS and that's its downfall.  Its formulaic plot brings 7 friends and a dog to an isolated location where a redneck sheriff and his two partners have somehow amassed several sharks to film real shark attacks for Internet voyeurs and make lots of money.  Nice huh?  Donal Logue chews up the scenery; Sarah Paxton, Katherine MacPhee and Dustin Milligan are adequate victims; Chris Carmack and Joshua Leonard seem appropriately stupid, although Carmack's ""revenge"" motive makes no sense.  And Sinqua Walls is stuck with the preposterous role of the football hero who loses his arm but still manages to walk around and kill the shark who killed his girlfriend.  Jeesh!

4911805,2,B00600SPG0,"**SPOILER ALERT**  There is a point in fiction when you rub your eyes and think to yourself... Why?  Why would the directors of any film take so many liberties with what we all know to be completely inplausable.  It's like several people sat around a boardroom table and said,  Ok,  this script is kinda slow, let's throw in human controlled sharks, and oh yeah!  Let's also throw in an internet ploy to make money off of said shark attacks that we hillbilly types have assembled for our profit...  Really??  Let's also take sharks and ignore any rational traits of said sharks. We can make them move at impossible speeds and with ridiculous intelligence so that they ""stalk"" their kills and then we will have a bull shark jump 5 feet out of the water to eat a guy on a sea do...  Really?  Even if you break it down to the most simplistic level the movie is a ""tough swimmer to swallow""  Even the 3d elements seem misplaced and sporadic at best.

I can remember at about Jaws 3 I got to a point where it was more about what impossible things were happening than the movie itself.  This movie was no different for me.  It's a shame because the idea had potential... Just like it did  back when Jaws put on the 3d glasses.  Do yourself a favor and watch THE REEF for a better and more realistic take on human survival within the ocean. Open Water is also a much better option.

Set in Louisiana, seven Tulane undergraduates - Sara (Sarah Paxton), Nick (Dustin Milligan), Beth (Katharine McPhee), Malik (Sinqua Walls), Maya (Alyssa Diaz), Blake (Chris Zylka) and Gordon (Joel David Moore) - drive to Sara's family vacation home on a secluded private lake near Lake Pontchartrain. At a local bait shop, Sara encounters her old boyfriend, Dennis (Chris Carmack) and his friend, Red (Joshua Leonard). Dennis and Red make racial taunts to Malik and Maya, his Latina fiance, but Sara diffuses the situation. Sara drives a speedboat recklessly to the vacation home, attracting the attention of Sheriff Sabin (Donal Logue). He chases her, frightening her friends, but then happily shares a beer with them. He tells Sara he is happy to see her back after a three-year- long absence.

While Gordon tries to seduce Beth and Sara sunbathes, Nick, Blake, Malik and Maya go waterskiing. A shark pursues Malik and attacks him. Nick, Blake and Maya try to rescue him, but he swims back to shore - missing his right arm. When Nick swims out into the lake to retrieve his arm, he is stalked and pursued by the shark. Nick barely makes it back to shore. A medical student, he stabilizes Malik, then goes with Sara and Maya to take him to a hospital. However, blood dripping from Malik's wound attracts a shark that attacks the boat. Maya is knocked into the water and eaten. The shark then damages the steering column of the boat. It crashes into the gas pump in front of the boathouse, exploding and stranding everyone. Sara, Nick and Malik barely make it to shore. Because their cell phones have no reception and the house has no landline, they cannot call for help. Blah, blah, blah.

When Sara (Sara Paxton) and her pals arrive at her parents' Louisiana lake house, the party is in full gear.

Concerned with getting him to the nearest hospital as quickly as possible, it isn't until they're far from shore that they realize the lake is teeming with hungry sharks and a small speedboat isn't about to stop them from getting their next meal.  In addition to the sharks, Director David R. Ellis (""Snakes on a Plane"") has thrown in some backwoods ""Deliverance""-style rednecks and inept law enforcement.

The film has its share of ""Jaws""-inspired scares, but lacks the polish and genuine fright factor of the Spielberg classic.

Followed that by clever foreshadowing such as ""I don't think we will have cell phone reception out here"" and then you got yourself a standard, teenage flick with predictable outcomes.  Of course there is an ethnic representation in the movie, an African-American male and his Hispanic girlfriend.  Guess who is the first to go in this movie?  That I don't have to answer that question says something.  Yup, the both of them.  Guess who stays alive?  The nerdy white kid who wants to talk to the popular girl but she gives him no time of day until the end of the movie where they both stay alive in which I imagine a typical future with picket fences, soccer van, and 2.47 kids.
On to the plot which was most likely written by fifth graders with down syndrome.  Sharks infest the saltwater lake in Louisiana as the group of friends are out in the waters having a grand old time.  One of them gets hurt by the shark and need to take him to the hospital.  They try to use the boat to go there since there is no cell phone reception but naturally the shark stops them from leaving, causing a gas leak and the boat blowing up.  Now they're stuck.  They get kidnapped by a couple of racist locals who admit their scheme behind it all - they planted the sharks there to make money.  How?  Because everyone loves Youtube clips of sharks eating humans and they figure they can sell their clips to the highest bidder when filming them in underwater cameras and they also tagged each shark and their species.  Pretty sophisticated stuff for two men that share five teeth between them.
So I would suggest other activities that are more fun than watching this movie, such as joining a pottery class, drawing blood, or attending a funeral.  That is where this movie should be to never be seen again.",1322438400,11,1939,4.504297994269341

A big lumbering shark in the water or a snake in the grass is scary in reality but always falls flat for me on the big screen. While I do agree with the general consensus that ""Jaws"" is the rare creature feature that works, I have to say that the rest have done little thrill me. It is with this honest trepidation that I went to see ""Shark Night 3D"". ""Shark Night 3D"" is the latest creature feature to use both creatures in the water and 3D to lumbering effect. Neither is new or revolutionary. Sorry to say it but ""Jaws 3D"" beat you to the punch about thirty years ago.

Anyway, on to ""Shark Night 3D"" and what a treat this movie is.

""Shark Night 3D"" is everything that a horror movie shouldn't be. It's PG-13, it's loaded from beginning to end with grating pop/R&B songs, its 3D looks like crap, and the characters are so cookie cutter boring that you won't care who lives or who dies. I would say that you want them all to be shark bait but once you've seen one awful shark attack in this film, you'll feel like you've seen them all. Add to this a ridiculous third act twist that makes little sense (seriously, watch the movie and tell me how it is even POSSIBLE for the redneck hillbillies to do what they did) and some of the most implausible events I've ever seen in a movie and you've got one of the worst movies of the year.

Though, truth be told, it is comforting to know that if someone loses an arm in a giant lake, you can easily find it in dirty water by swimming out from your lake without a mask or goggles. After this, while locating said lost arm, you can also spot a bloodthirsty shark. When you see said shark, you can out swim it even though it can overtake a speeding boat with someone skiing behind. Did that just make your brain hurt? Ugh. Join the club. Last year's ""Piranha 3D"" was dumb, harmless fun.
