837352,5,6304293321,"I saw this movie 25(?) years ago and cried as a little girl. Now that I am 38 and I watched it again from a completely different perspective, I think I cried even more. This is a movie that ALL must see!! It is the most heart-warming story ever written. I am so glad that Joy and George Adamson shared their story of Elsa with the rest of the world!!!!",1005609600,38,352,4.042857142857143
837353,5,6304293321,"I've probably seen this movie somewhere between 15 to 20 times since I was a kid. (I also read the book many moons ago.) It never ceases to entertain and is guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes by the time the song ""Born Free"" resounds at the end. Born Free is the wonderful true story of the raising of Elsa, the lioness, by Joy and George Adamson (sorry to correct another reviewer, but Virgina McKenna was the actress who played Joy Adamson, so it's not the story of Elsa and the McKenna's). The story is heart warming, can be seen by the whole family, & will make you want to book a trip to Kenya when it's all said and done.  No question, this is one of my favorites of all time!",995673600,28,686,4.157894736842105

837761,3,6304293321,When I heard this was about Elsa being freed I thought this was like the sequel to that Frozen movie; boy was I mistaken.  There was very little Broadway-like music sung and no freezing and unfreezing of despicable siblings.  I sort of suspect this movie was trying to ride off the fame of other movies with the main character named Elsa.  On the plus side this movie taught me that lions can be nice house pets and that they are happier when people try petting them...maybe I'll start searching for a hypoallergenic lion.,1459209600,,522,4.591397849462366

837839,5,6304293321,"A classic, Born Free follows the journey of Elsa the lioness and her human caretakers. Very few people have ever been successful in re-wilding lions, but Elsa was exceptional, as were the Adamsons. She had real heart and her story has touched millions for more than 50 years, in many languages worldwide. The title song Born Free has become an anthem for conservation. The film continues to touch hearts and has withstood the test of time.",1446163200,6,439,4.7894736842105265

837962,5,6304293321,"Heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. Based off of the book by Joy Adamson... Joy  painstakingly teaches her tame lioness friend to hunt in the wild and care for herself because the government is forcing her husband George , who is game warden,  to take his long leave in a different climate. This nearly destroys Elsa, but Joys refusal to confine her dear feline friend to a zoo pushes her onward. Together Elsa and Joy overcome obstacles that nobody thought they ever could. And in the end, Elsa is free....fending for herself...yet she still retains her friendship with Joy and George. And so, Elsa is living free, the way she was born free. Loved this move! Would recommend!  ( I also recommend the Books by Joy Adamson, Born Free, Living Free, Forever Free.....I also purchased them from Amazon)",1437609600,2,811,4.820143884892087

838330,5,6304293321,"This wonderful film moves me no matter how many times I see it.  I recently revisited it after not having seen it for years, and I was completely absorbed in Elsa's story once again.

Approximately 19 or 20 different lions were used to portray Elsa and the other lions at different ages.  The lioness Mara receives the majority of the screentime, portraying Elsa as an adult so beautifully.  Mara herself had an upbringing similar to Elsa's and she is perfect as Elsa here.

The cinematography is excellent, too.  There are several long shots of the African savannah and the animals, close-ups of the lion cubs in the house, and even occasional still photographs of the real Elsa interspersed in several scenes, all of which come together to make you feel as if you really were there witnessing not a film production but actually Joy and Elsa themselves.

Virginia McKenna has always had my admiration for her love of animals and her activism on behalf of animal welfare (inspired by the life-changing experience of making this film and being moved by Elsa's story), in addition to her heartfelt acting.  She and Bill Travers starred together in Ring of Bright Water, as they do here.  Born Free is my favorite, however, with its beautiful depiction of the bond between Joy (Virginia McKenna) and Elsa (Mara) and its theme of overcoming challenges to do what is best for the animal you love even if it breaks your heart to have to let them go, while at the same time making your heart soar to witness the beloved animal's growth and triumph.",1420156800,,1541,4.720149253731344

838700,5,6304293321,"I watched this nearly 20 years ago as a kid. I remember the relationship between the actors and the lions having been so close and personal that I thought they were the real Adamsons. I don't know how much of it was green-screens and trickery to get the lions in the picture with the people, but I do know that this movie brought me closer to nature and appreciating it without taking anything out of it and making it mine, like so many pathetic, selfish people do when getting exotic pets, going trophy hunting, and so on.
Even at that age, I felt taught a valuable lesson about how to treat wildlife, and today it's what keeps my eyes wide open when looking for conservation and rehabilitation projects to donate to or volunteer at.

After all, one major lesson of the 2nd film especially, was not to pet or handle wild animals if they are to ever return to the wild. Only because of this film have I internalized to absolutely avoid wildlife volunteer projects that offer cub petting or bottle-raising cubs for volunteers.
The actors today have the Born Free Foundation as their legacy, themselves inspired by the lives of the Adamsons. I've adopted (by donation) one of their rescued lions, Dolo, and many other animals can be helped through people becoming more aware of the ugly truth of wildlife trade, canned hunting, lion breeding, etc. And a huge part of the credit for this awareness, I think is due to Born Free and the lovely lioness Elsa and her human foster parents.

If you want to be educated, moved, amazed, and entertained all at the same time, and if you want some inspiration to do something for wildlife - through supporting non-breeding and non-petting organizations - this movie is a must-see!",1410480000,,1717,4.663366336633663

B. Born Free 1965, no CGI, no robots, real life stuff ?

Favorite moments:  the lion cubs playing; Ilse meeting the bachelor lion; Ilse and the wart hog; at the beach; and the final scene.

839536,5,6304293321,"Born Free is a wonderful story that is both educational and entertaining. Educational as it shows us how the actions of humans affect that of our environment and the animals and humans living in it. It shows how our well intended actions can be harmful to wildlife. The family who adopt three lion cubs tame them making them dependent on human beings. They  are wild animals and need to remain so to be what they truly are.
This is a cute story of love between a man and his wife and the three lion cubs the man rescued after killing their mother and father. It shows Africa at a better time in history before much of the wildlife had been obliterated by safari hunters, and Africans having access to poison to kill off predators, particularly lions.

839954,5,6304293321,I saw this movie when it first came out and now it has been 40 something years.  Still a great TRUE story.  Or Hollywood verison of a true story.  If you ever owned an animal and got to find out how much they have in common with us; you will relate very well to the idea that it is possible to even tame a lion; If it wants to be made tame.

839955,5,6304293321,"Having seen this years ago, I decided it watch it again, It's a wonderful story, as illustrates what I have alays known- animals, like humans, form lasting bonds with those who care about them and for them.

840253,2,6304293321,"I wanted so much to like this movie and I was horrified to find out this was a true story!!! It was like watching a badly written script with really terrible acting. ( the matching pajama top on her and bottoms on him was ridiculous), but, The animals ARE beautiful, they are extremely well trained, they are likely circus animals, not wild at all by any stretch of the imagination. The only reason I gave it two stars was becasue how beautiful these animals are. Made me so sad to see once again how stupid the human race is and that the only solution humans have for anything is to kill. It was pathetic to see them shoot the 'man eating lion' ( as if there were other kinds of lions) and the mother. How is any human justified in killing a lion? Oh! because ""man"" has invented guns to use, so it is okay to kill an animal. But when a 'man' eats a cow or a horse or a lion or any animal it is somehow alright?..yeah?...because these animals don't have bullets to shoot us....hmm.
People who call this a good family film suprised me. This concept is so upside down!!! basically two British people decided to live out an adventurous lifestyle moving into Africa where they had no business going in the first place; that's just to start off, then they try to impose their values on everyone there - including the wild animals. The woman doesnt have her own children ( at least not in this movie version) so naturally she develops affection towards something small, cute and cudly - whats available after her husband murdered their father and mother are three lion cubs. The man and woman are clueless about animal behavior and everything these two do is basically out of selfish motives (kill, play, oh these two are a little inconvenient - so lets ship them off to a zoo - why didn't they just release them?;tame the lion, reintroduce her to the wild...omg!) There are other scenes when the husband gets up in the middle of the night (wearing his matching pajama bottoms) and goes outside of their tent, steps over their ""pet lion"", then grabs a gun in order to shoot the intruding ""wild lion""!
Are you all watching this?
then another unbelievable movie moment - when a hunter visits this couple and actually says "" I would really like to kill an elephant""
in a tone as if he was bragging about taking out a bowling pin.
Add to this her 'blond and sweet' looks and personality and the unnatural acting and you have an example of what NOT to do in life or in movies.",1389139200,2,2465,4.41978021978022

Of course, never got anywhere with that but never saw the movie again, until I bought it here on Amazon and it was just a wonderful blast from the past. I bought it cause my grand daughter loves animals and I thought she'd love this story...and she did. And she to started to write a book about her doing the same thing.

Joy and her husband, George, Adamson used extreme measures in caring for Elsa, sometimes driving hundreds of miles for medicine or supplies.  I was so impressed with the vastness of Africa, Joy's terror of elephants on the move, her love of the African birds, among other things.

After 46 years and numerous documentaries on reintroducing animals to the wild and the Christian the Lion videos, I decided to revisit this, my introduction to wild cats. And forty six years and all those documentaries haven't diminished its impact - I still found myself well up with tears as the credits rolled. The real George Adamson can be found on the Christian the Lion videos on YouTube but you don't really watch this for George - you watch it for Joy (played by Virginia McKenna) and Elsa (and yes, I know the cat in this movie was NOT Elsa but Henrietta but that doesn't matter.) Thus - as the true life of the wild Elsa doesn't diminish the impact of this film - thanks to the Adamsons and their books, the idea of caging big cats became recognized as the cruelty is was and habitat zoos replaced most zoos around the world and sanctuaries for retired pet and circus cats and reintroduction programs for 'excess' captive bred lions were successful. But that sight of the once pet lion and her mate and cubs recumbent on a boulder still makes me cry.

The story of Elsa the Lioness is truly a story of heartbreak, love, and inspiration.  Joy and George Adamson become the ""parents"" of three orphaned lion cubs.  They tenderly raise them to young adulthood and then send two away to a zoo, while Elsa remains with them.  Joy Adamson refused to send Elsa to a zoo and instead attempts to teach her how to live free in the wilds of Kenya, something that had never been done before.  Will Joy be able to let Elsa go, to live on her own?  Can Elsa learn to live wild and free again?  The answers await you in this heart-touching, lovely film.  You will cry tears of joy as you watch this story unfold and then conclude.  Suitable for family viewing, this is a wonderful film for the entire family to love and enjoy.  Most highly recommended. (Brief episodes of animal violence and one swear word).  It is rated PG.

  The cub was first found when George Adamson, which is Bill Travers, goes on a hunting trip. He finds three lion cubs and takes them home for his wife Joy Adamson, which is Virginia Mckenna. They name the cubs Big One, Lastica, and Elsa. They had to sell two cubs, and Elsa gets kept.

 About two years later, Elsa shows an interest in going off on her own. The Adamsons train her how to hunt and get along with other lions. A year later, she has three cubs of her own, and she lives happily for ever.
  I loved lions ever since I watched this movie, and I hope you would enjoy this movie too.",1353801600,,792,3.8819875776397517
841396,4,6304293321,"""Born Free"" (1965) is a great film for animal lovers, especially cat lovers. It tells the story of a couple living in Africa who come across three orphan lion cubs and keep one female, whom they name Elsa. Later they are pressured to give Elsa up to a zoo, but the woman can't because, as she argues, Elsa was born free and should therefore live free. She'd never be happy in a zoo.

Unfortunately, Elsa has become too tame as a result of living with the couple. Can Elsa ever adapt to the wild or will she be condemned to a cage in a zoo?

The footage of Elsa with the couple is amazing. She's like their pet cat! I'd love to have a lioness pet to hug and pat and walk around the yard with!

Shot in beautiful Kenya, the film runs 95 minutes.

I wouldn't let anyone under 5 watch it however.

I was afraid that Elsa would become wild and forget her human parents (which would have broken my daughter's heart), but that doesn't happen.

841586,5,6304293321,"As the story opens, George Adamson (Bill Travers), a game warden in Kenya, is bringing three orphan lion cubs home to be cared for by his wife, Joy (Virginia McKenna).  Raised as pets, two of them are eventually sent away to zoos, but the third, Elsa, was especially loved and they decided to keep her.  Of course, that soon became impossible, so they set about rehabilitating her back into the wild knowing she might not survive, but feeling she must have the chance to live free.

In the 1950s, no one had ever reintroduced an animal to the wild, and the Adamses were the first animal lovers to do so.  Travers and McKenna are wonderful as the couple and went on to become animal activists after the filming of the movie.  Geoffrey Keene (the 'Minister of Defence' in six James Bond movies) gives able support as George's boss.  The Kenyan landscape photography is simply breathtaking and the lions, at various stages of development, are adorable.

John Barry won Academy Awards for both his score and song, which are truly iconic and guaranteed to have you reaching for the tissues.  This beautiful, inspiring, and unforgettable movie is a must-see for animal lovers.",1280534400,2,1170,4.786069651741293

841644,4,6304293321,"I saw this when it came out in 1966 or so and got it so that I could share it with my kids.  It was an absolute delight to watch with them, starting from the playing of lion cubs in a house to the struggle to re-introduce Elsie into the wild.  Of particular interest was the notion that the conventional wisdom about animals is wrong, that a deeper entente and understanding with them is possible if humans would only try.

Joy Adamson developed a relationship with Elsie much as a mother would treat a child.  Though a dangerous animal to most observers, including her husband's boss, she loved the lion and influenced her personality development.  She then figured out a way to release Elsie into the wild again, which no one had ever succeeded in doing.  Finally, a year later, the couple found Elsie and ""visited"" with her and her cubs for an entire day, until her mate called from the distance; they would return in subsequent years to get to know the cubs.  Perhaps I am reading too much into it, but it seems to me that Joy discovered other possibilities of being and communication with a wild animal, which should get us all to think beyond genetic determinism and conventional behavioral models.  This is very profound as we contemplate the management of the planet in perilous times.

The beauty of our experience is that the kids and I could discuss these issues as well as enjoy the spectacle of an animal film that was fun and very funny yet moving.  While I suspect that much of it is fictionalized - the couple later divorced and George Adamson died by recklessly driving at poachers trying to warn him off - the acting is wonderful as is the photography.

First of all, for any movie goer, this is a MUST. This is a sweet movie of a wonderful true story, performed superbly by the actors and even by the animals (whom you won't like to think as animals after the movie finishes).

Apart from technicalities (vivid imagery of Kenya), acting and top class music, what I liked most of the movie is the simple, lyrical way it tells us the eternal story of life cycle. Not only of lions or animals, but human being as well, may be of all living beings.
Passion and care in grooming Elsa and her siblings were no different than grooming one's own children (the couple had no children), while the way Elsa has been trained to acclimatized to the world including swimming only reminds us about growing kids. The ultimate test of parenthood for the couple came to teach and facilitate Elsa to have a partner in the wild, which brought in as much excitement, joy, suspense and concern as parents feel when their daughter gets married. The wonder of the movie is, through this cycle of the lions, we remember the eternal cycle of life of human being as well. Starting with Elsa's cubhood to her motherhood, thereby triggering another set of cubhood - the film charms us with this ageless story of life cycle.

841648,5,6304293321,"More tragedy on the plains of Africa...

Astonishingly, Joy Adamson and George Adamson were both murdered, in 1980 and 1989 respectively.

Joy's death was originally thought to be due to a lion mauling, according to the autopsy report. Then it was hinted that she had been murdered with a weapon which inflicted wounds similar to a lion's...traces of metal in the cut flesh. Finally, Paul Nakware Ekai, one of the compound's employees, was charged and convicted of her murder. He initially admitted to stabbing Joy, later stating that she had shot him in the foot, and he, in turn, of shooting her three times. Her temperament was not, by some accounts, remotely similar to Miss  McKenna's.

George was shot and killed by Somali bandits while coming to the aid of a safari.

Parenthetically, Dian Fossey (Gorillas in the Mist)was brutally murdered in 1985. Her true assailant, a government official, has recently been charged with her murder, though two others were earlier convicted of the crime, Kangaroo-Court style.

The 1980's were bad years for prominent naturalists.

1966 was a good vintage for great films: Born Free, A Man for all Seasons, The Professionals, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.

841766,4,6304293321,"Along with Lassie Come Home, Born Free is probably the gold standard of animal movies in terms, and there's a lot to like in this story of Joy Adamson and her gamekeeper husband trying to return the domesticated lioness Elsa to the wild: the lion cubs are cute, the Scope wildlife photography still impressive and John Barry's score especially beautiful (the famous Matt Munro song was added to the end titles after the film was already on release. Where it shows its age is when the humans take centre-stage. At times Virginia McKenna can be a bit too head girl of the hockey school as Joy Adamson for a modern audience - while the Adamsons' real-life relationship was so tempestuous they spent much of their lives apart (Travers recalled that during filming whenever George was in the doghouse, Joy would treat him with equal condescension), their movie incarnations are so determinedly nice they make characters from Disney films of the 60s look like axe murderers. That said, McKenna and Travers are one of the few real-life married couples who make a convincing couple onscreen, bringing a comfortable familiarity to their scenes that smoothes over some of the more twee dialogue.

Its surprise success after a slow start led to director James Hill reluctantly being typecast on many of the slew of similar animal films that followed in its wake while his two stars started the Born Free foundation to release zoo animals into the wild. It also led to a very unfortunate sequel, Living Free, though none of the key players apart from Carl Foreman would return.

841768,4,6304293321,"I was trying to remember just why I never saw this film when it first came out--or subsequently when it might have been shown on TV--when it occurred to me that it was released in 1966 when I was 13, just at the age when I was suddenly less interested in ""kids' stuff"" like BORN FREE and increasingly interested in HELP or A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  But deep down, I had always liked animal flicks, and maybe even then--at least in the back of my mind--figured I'd catch up with this tale of a tame lionness, whose ""human companions"" attempt to re-train in the ways of the wild.

Viewing the film as an adult, I can see that I probably would have liked it well enough as a youngster, and can agree with the majority of reviewers below, that it is a solid, engaging ""family film,"" and a pleasant alternative to much of the brash, jaded and bankrupt fare offered to kids nowadays.  It seems pretty wholesome  by comparison.

Like many family films of the era, however, it was also relatively low budget and not all that ""well made"" a product.  The story is a bit on the sketchy side, and you can see the filmmakers making a very deliberate effort to compress the contents of Joy Adamson's book into a 90 minute film.  One example that comes to mind are the references to Joy's husband's near-fatal battle with malaria.  His initial bout is never shown, only referred to in a voice over by actress Virginia McKenna, who plays Joy.  Well, fair enough, I figured, it's not that essential to the story of Elsa, the lionness, and it might be disturbing to younger viewers, so leave it out.  But then, a later relapse is portrayed in pretty graphic detail.  It seems to come almost out of the blue, and will likely confuse younger viewers who may not have seen it coming from the brief mention in the voiceover narration.

Films aimed at children, and their families, often seem to cut corners this way.  In the case of a film based on real life, as this one is, there is also the question of just how much dramatic license to take.  I never read Adamson's book on which the film is based, but it seems like the movie version must have hewed fairly closely to the text.  There are scenes such as the ""roving lion in the night"" sequence that promise some drama--and some danger--only to pretty much peter out in the end.

If that's the case, the filmmakers are actually to be commended for not taking too many liberties with the text.  But better direction, overall pacing and editing can help spice up scenes like these, ones where the action is muted, because in real life, the danger really did pass, or was not as great as it seemed to begin with.

None of this is meant to suggest that the film is not worth seeing.  They really DON'T make 'em like this any more.  Nowadays, Elsa would have had to engage in a battle royal with the roving lion that prowls around the camp at night, and the computer graphics would be dazzling but ultimately misleading.  Parents and children alike will appreciate this film's slower pace, its implicit message on the reverence and preservation of the natural world (an even more vital question today than it was then).  In an era when the need to protect and preserve wildlife and its habitat is even clearer than it was 40 years ago, BORN FREE serves as a reminder that there is much work to be done--but that it's well worth the effort.",1198195200,4,3361,4.457516339869281

841884,4,6304293321,"Propelled by Matt Munro's Sinatra-esque rendition of the memorable title tune, this family-friendly nature film directed by James Hill was a must-see when it was originally released in 1966. Four decades later, the song has become a anthem-like clich for all subsequent animal-freeing stories, and I'm actually surprised at the implied graphic nature of some of the scenes, in particular, the opening lion attack which spurs  British game warden George Adamson to kill the man-eating parents of Elsa and her two sister cubs. However, the heart of the story is still his wife Joy's true-story account of raising and freeing Elsa into the wild to survive rather than suffer the fate of her siblings who are exiled to the Rotterdam Zoo. The stunning Kenya locations and carefully trained lions bring this involving story to life, but credit should also be given to Virginia McKenna's proud, touching performance as Joy.

McKenna makes us see Elsa through her eyes as she mothers the cub only to be forced to come to terms with what the animal's natural instincts should be. Bill Travers, McKenna's real-life husband, plays George, though he is there mostly to be Joy's support system. Because the film only runs a brief 95 minutes, the story can feel episodic and disjointed, giving precious little time to related plot points such as George's drug dependency from malaria and how Joy's reasoning is clouded by her focused affection for Elsa. Fleshing out these aspects could have made for a more rounded portrait of the Adamsons. As it stands, it is still a stunningly photographed adventure film documentary-like in cinematic style but leavened by its heartfelt approach. It's no wonder McKenna and Travers remained active in the conservation movement for years afterward.

As it is based on a true story, that makes it even better.  And what a story it is too.

Game warden George Adamson and his wife Joy are residents in Kenya, Africa and relate their experiences of raising an orphaned lion cub after the mother has been shot out of self-defense reasons.  Actually it is three lion cubs but two are sent off to a zoo and the third, eventually named Elsa, is raised by Joy Adamson.  It is interesting and enjoyable to watch the interaction of the cub with the adults and the relationship that grows ever closer between them.  Upon raising the cub to maturity, it becomes a difficult time for the Adamson's knowing that releasing the grown lion into the wild is the only real answer.  Due to being tame for so long, it is Joy's responsibility now to train Elsa to be able to survive on its own and she does an admirable job.  When the fateful day finally comes, it tugs at the heart strings to see the emotional effects on the Adamson's when releasing something they love so dearly.  It is also inspiring knowing that they cared so much and did it for all the right reasons.  It eventually makes for a wonderful end to a great movie.

As for the film particulars, the cinematography is very attractive in Africa and the accompanying music is a perfect compliment to everything else.  The acting is so innocent and natural you can almost be fooled into believing this isn't a movie.  For being a timeless classic that is now over 4 decades old, this movie stands the test of time and will always be a treasure for anyone and everyone.

The story of a British game-keeper, George, and his wife, Joy, who adopt a Lioness cub, Elsa, and raise her in their African home.  It was made in the 60's before politically correctness became the modern facism it is, so there is some hunting (guns are pointed and fired but nothing more is shown), and one scary scene at the beginning when a rogue lion attacks an African woman at the riverside (the woman screams and the river reddens - we skip that scene). But the rest is a lot of wonderful scenes of a well-loved lioness overturning the housewares, riding on the hood of their jeep, sleeping on their cot, and generally dominating their lives in a most fantastic way, before they train her to live free again in the wild. Its a lovely story that could never be told quite this way again, and we love it.",1167004800,2,985,4.3478260869565215
842046,5,6304293321,"It may be hard to believe that there were classic family films created in the 60's by anyone other than Disney. This movie is an example of a very good and classic family film, one where the only car chase is after a lion, there are no video games to be seen anywhere, and the central themes of the movie are love and that wild things should live free.

This movie is based on a book by Joy Adamson by the same name and chronicles her and her husband's experiences with a trio of lion cubs. Eventually two of the cubs are sent to a zoo, but the third lion, a lioness that Joy calls Elsa, remains with Joy and her husband George. Of course, lions are wild animals and they can live with people for only so long.  Joy is faced with the need to have Elsa sent to a zoo. Joy is unable to think of Elsa being caged when she has been free for her whole life, so she attempts what had not been done before; repatriation of a captive lion back into the wild.

Elsa and her husband worked long, hard and with a lot of frustration, despaired that Elsa would never be able to go back to the wild, or that she would die as a result of their attempts. All along the way you can see Joy Adamson's love for Elsa and her need to see Elsa be able to return to the wild.

Andy Williams sings ""Born Free"" to accompany the end of the movie. This song is one of Andy Williams' best. If you are familiar with this song you will recognize portions of it throughout the movie as a recurring theme.

This movie is simple and heart-warming. There are a few moderately violent scenes, but I would consider this movie appropriate for children of all ages, though with parents watching when the youngest family members watch.

842048,5,6304293321,"As old of a movie as Born Free is, it will always be a true classic. Based on the true story of Joy and George Adamson and their experiences raising the lioness named Elsa, Born Free is a heartwarming story of unconditional love. When George is called upon to kill a male lion that was known for killing and mauling local people in Kenya, he stumbles across 3 small helpless lion cubs which he brings home. Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, who play Joy and George Adamson deliver a wonderful performance. Joy and George sucessfully rear these 3 cubs with 2 of them eventually going off to zoos. All 3 cubs were loved and well taken care of but because of Joy's love and fondness  of the 3rd cub she named Elsa, the Adamson's decided to keep Elsa and raise her themselves with the intention of one day teaching her to hunt on her own and eventually releasing her to be free and survive on her own in the wild. We see the love that can be shared between people and yes, even a lioness. There are many touching moments in this film. Being filmed in Africa, we get to see the beauty of the areas that Elsa roamed and shared with the Adamsons. We experience the heartbreak that Joy endured when it was time to set Elsa free to be on her own. Elsa never forgot her adopted parents and visited them often. The Adamson's hard work paid off as Elsa returned to the wild and survived on her own and eventually found a mate and gave birth to 3 cubs of her own. There is a part 2 and 3 to Born Free and they are Living Free and Forever Free. Both are great movies as we follow Elsa's 3 cubs after her death. There are also books written by Joy Adamson with the same titles. This movie will truly touch your heart in many ways. The song Born Free will forever remind me of Elsa and what a special lioness she was along with the Adamsons who succeeded at doing something that no one else had ever done.... raise a lion cub and return it to the wild to survive and thrive on her own.

842224,5,6304293321,"You always here the story or the expression that you can't take wild animals and try to them into pets. This movie tells and shows you why. The movie is based on a true story from a book by Joy Adamson. The movie is set back in the 1950 era when George Adamson who is the game warden for the Kenya area in Africa.  While out on a routine run George has to kill a charging female lion in self defense. After George kills the lion he discovers that the lion was a mother as three lion cubs come out of no where. George takes the 3 cub's home because he knows that if he didn't the cubs will die. When the cubs get too much to handle they have to make the hardest decision of their life. Do they send the animals to the Rotterdam Zoo? Do they send all the cubs or do they keep one?  To me the acting was great as Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna play George and Joy Adamson. As a side note McKenna also narrates the story as Joy voice-over, using the book. The real star of the show, though, is Elsa herself, actually played by three different lionesses. You can really see the genuine affection between the large cat and her caretakers as they interact. It is magical to watch. This movie would be great for you and your family because there's none of the following in this picture. There's really no violence, and there's no sex or any swearing for that matter. The entire movie was shot in Africa. If you can get the DVD the picture quality is as good as a movie that you would buy today. This review is based on my home addition of Born Free on DVD.

842225,5,6304293321,"""Born Free,"" is an absolute wonderful film.  It's beautiful, about a couple who take care of a lion cub whom they love and nurture and name Elsa.  She is smart and they love her like a child.  But also they want her to be free and never to be put in a zoo.  It's a very emotional and moving film.  I'd give it  ten stars it certainlty desrves it.  It's a true story based on a book.  Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, real life husband and wife portray a married couple in the movie too.  They are wonderful actors first rate.  They make the performance moving, sad, and happy.  They capture all the moments.  Elsa is also a star in the movie.  She's very sweet and a gentle lion who doesn't hurt anyone, because she's been raised since a cub by humens.  The tile song alone adds much more emotion too the film and helps tell the story and tell it's theme.  It's a beautiful and inspiring song.  I'd highly recommend this film to anyone. There are some flaws too from the time period it was made and the wrong and unfair treatment of Africans as servents.

But the rest of the film is good and the scenery in Kenya is breathtakingly beautiful.",1108425600,2,1144,4.295774647887324
842226,5,6304293321,"This movie won the 1966 Academy Awards for song and best score shared by John Barry and Don Black which is sung by Frank Sinatra; I'm surprised it didn't win more awards than it did because this is my all time favorite movie!  I saw this with my parents a few years after it came out in 1965; I cry every time, love everything about this picture.  Love the lions!!!  Especially Elsa who hung around until the local government got tired of her antics.  The maturing Elsa begins to attract wild male lions and pretty soon, it becomes all too clear it's either the zoo or the African savannah.  She came to the Adamson's East African residence when she was a little cub, her parents shot and killed by her soon to be foster father, George Adamson, the game warden for the area.  Getting Elsa to adjust back to life in the wild is no easy matter and is the major part of the story.

The Adamsons in the movie, Travers and McKenna, were married in real life.  I think Virginia McKenna's performance really made this movie.  It looks like she didn't make tons of movies but has always been admired for her performances in the ones she did, sometimes winning nominations for them.  For years after making the movie, she and her husband became active in conservation issues establishing the Born Free Foundation with their oldest son in 1991. She's also written a few books on the subject.  The story is true and follows very closely the book written by the real Joy Adamson.

842227,5,6304293321,"Without bombs, bullet, swear words, light sabers, bathroom humor, or any special effects, this managed to hold a wide age range group's attention. Other reviewers have commented a lot about the VHS movie, so let me confine my remarks to the DVD.

Actually, as DVDs go, this is not so great. The movie makes you very curious about a lot of things: how in the heck did they train the animals to make all their moves for the camera? how true to life is the story? and so on. The DVD, by virtue of totally lacking extras, utterly fails to answer any of those questions. The picture has that of-an-era very colorful and yet simultaneously slightly washed out look that begs, nay screams, for some kind of color correction. And the sound clearly has effects of tape compression or something; it is not very open (I listened in stereo, and don't know if there is a 5.1 track).

If you're looking for a reference DVD with gorgeous cinematography of African scenes, this isn't it (due to the color imbalance)l. I give it 5 stars anyway simply because the movie is so well made.",1096588800,11,1068,4.528497409326425
842228,5,6304293321,"Based on a true story, as told by Joy Adamson in her book of the same title, this 1966 film remains compelling today. The movie follows the adventure of a British couple, game warden George Adamson and his wife (Joy, author of the book), living in Kenya in the 1950s, who become surrogate parents for a litter of three orphaned lion cubs. When the mother is shot in self-defense, the Adamsons bring the cubs into their home, planning to turn them over to the Rotterdam Zoo as soon as the zoo is ready to receive them. However, Joy forms a strong bond with the smallest of the cubs, whom she names Elsa, and ultimately cannot bear to part with her. So while Elsa's siblings eventually depart for the zoo, Elsa herself stays with the Adamsons. At first all goes well, but as Elsa grows into a mature lioness, it quickly becomes apparent that she cannot remain with her human family. And so, rather than send Elsa to a zoo and subject her to life in a cage, Joy is determined to do something no one has ever done successfully before - teach a tame lion to survive in the wild, and ultimately set her free.

The acting is good, with real-life couple Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna playing George and Joy Adamson (McKenna also narrates the story as Joy via voice-over, pulling passages from the book). There are a few places where the dialogue seems slightly forced, but for the most part it is very sincere. The real star of the show, though, is Elsa herself, actually played by three different lionesses. You can really see the genuine affection between the large cat and her caretakers as they interact. It is magical to watch.

""Born Free"" relies on none of the modern-day tactics for holding an audience's attention. There is very little violence of any sort, no gore, no explosions, no sweeping romance, no sex, and as far as I could tell, not even a single swear word. The only fight scene is one between two lions, and the only chases are lions going after prey. Yet the movie maintains the ability to captivate a viewer entirely. It may hold the highest appeal for children, but animal-loving adults are sure to love it, too. I first saw this movie as a kid, but when I recently re-watched it after many years I was happy to find that it remained thoroughly enjoyable. I would warn, though, that very small children may possibly be frightened by the lion attack scene at the very beginning. The attack itself is now shown, but the lion's leap and the victim's scream are. I remember being a little unnerved by this part when I was little, so if you have a very young child, it may be best to watch this scene yourself first to determine whether it's likely to bother them.

The one thing that worries me a bit about this story is the fact that the Adamsons actually used gunshots to call Elsa to them. Even at the end of the film, Elsa still displays no fear of either guns or humans. Such a lack of fear can be quite very detrimental to a wild animal, particularly in an area where lions are often shot to protect livestock. I don't fault the makers of the movie at all, since this is based on events as they really happened and the movie couldn't have been filmed differently without altering the story, but it's still a little worrisome.

The entire movie was filmed on location in Kenya, and the scenery is gorgeous. Unfortunately, the picture quality is not as crisp as you would see in movies made today. However, it is full color and still quite decent. The sound quality is slightly disappointing. It is occasionally difficult to make out what is being said, but turning up the volume enough to hear the dialogue clearly in turn makes the music a little too loud for comfort. I have no idea if either the picture quality or the sound have been touched up at all in the DVD version, as I only own the VHS, but neither is enough of a problem to interfere with the enjoyment of the movie, and one can easily forgive these things in a movie made nearly four decades ago. On the whole, this is a terrific family film and is just as touching and fun as it must have been when it first came out. And if you're the type that gets a kick out of watching your cats watch TV, this one has the potential to catch their interest as well, as it did mine.",1092614400,24,4255,4.41656050955414

842230,5,6304293321,"I bought a couple VHS copies of ""Born Free"" for myself and for my nephews last Christmas, thinking ""that would be a nice, clean movie for kids to have"", and I was not disappointed. You are instantly struck by the innocence of this movie. As another reviewer on this page wrote, I too cried more watching it as an adult and my husband and I remarked that we were really moved by it. Joy Adamson (played by Virginia McKenna) making her tearful speech about Elsa's right to be free struck us to the heart, that scene alone is enough to make this movie a classic.
Since seeing it again I have bought more as gifts for kids and for people who have grandkids. It is the favorite of our 17 month old, we always watch with him and skip the two very brief shooting scenes and the scene where Elsa kills the warthog, mind you these scenes are not graphic at all and they are very brief but he still put two and two together and cried. He was also upset by the cubs knocking over stuff and spilling the milk at first, but he quickly came to understand that that was okay. He loves this movie so much and begs all the time to see it. After seeing it the first time, we found him with his stuffed toys gathered around him ""feeding"" them from his bottle, like Joy and the lion cubs.
Due to the movie being made in the 60's, there is the one pitfall of the movie, the fact that the white characters have black African servants. The main black character is loved by all viewers of the movie, but still, the black employees are clearly in servitude and this jumps out at you; this element obviously has to be explained to kids but the movie is true to its time in history and of value to children despite this, and perhaps also because of this historical lesson.
Kids of all ages that we've seen watching this, (who have been raised on today's kids' movies that are so full of aggression, violence, sarcasm, etc,) were not at all bored by this innocent movie but instead were instantly captivated by it. All ages of viewers are so uplifted when Elsa gets to be free and be with her own kind. This movie is so uplifting, it's about freedom, the dignity of living creatures, compassion, responsibility, love, and hope. Beautiful scenery and animal footage, plus plenty of lighter moments and laughs. Adults get a little chuckle out of the very polite script, straight from the 1960's, though it is like a breath of fresh air, and of course there's the wonderful theme song which you will find yourself singing in the car and shower.

The story is a great one, the scsnerey in the movie is beautiful, and the acting is very good. The performance of the lioness in the film is spectacular.
 What I find particularly pleasing, in comparison with the movies of today, is the absence of human-on-human violence, sex, car chases, explosions, special effects, etc. This movie stands alone on its own merit - the power of the storyline and the heartwarming, though sad, story of the lioness named Elsa.

The two people go through everything that is inevitable when you have a large cat for a pet. The film has its share of emotional moments like when the Adamsons get the cubs to lap up milk for the first time, and the time when the adolescent Elsa is isolated for a few days and is found wounded and unstable. But they are well balanced out with the amusing situations like Elsa riding on the hood of the truck and her bringing a two year-old elephant calf to the camp etc.
The film is so polished and of high quality that unless one is aware that it was made in '66, he/she will undoubtedly be lead to think that it was made in at least 1980. I was really surprised. I will add however, that I watched the film on TV yesterday for the first time and that is what my review is based on. Anyway I doubt the VHS is any different. So clever is the film in getting its points and objectives across that even people who aren't into wildlife movies will enjoy this, as I observed while I was watching.
