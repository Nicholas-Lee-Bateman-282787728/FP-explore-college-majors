8303738,5,B001G3WPCQ,"I'm not sure why, but I love this movie. Amy Poehler is hysterical in it. But if you buy this version you probably want to know what the ""Exclusive Bonus Disc"" is. It's a episode of 30 Rock ""Greenzo"" and 6 short featurettes (~ 5 or 6 minutes). If you want more info you can google sites that track DVD double dips and locate the specific featurette names. I'm not sure how much extra the bonus disc would cost you over the normal version but if it's a small incremental cost (say $1 or so) and you really like the movie you may enjoy the additional features. If not then you can skip it. Note that the Bluray has a picture in picture track that shows all the regular DVD version features in it during the movie but does NOT have the content that comes with this bonus DVD.",1411862400,,772,4.1879194630872485
