There is truly something captivating about getting so close to this wild animals in their own environment which is not the same as witnessing it from a distance even with the best HD cameras, absolutely real and live. Anticipate the best of dolphins documentary with spycam to be released in late 2014 unless you have BBC UK reception at present time. Bravo.",1388361600,8,927,4.910828025477707
