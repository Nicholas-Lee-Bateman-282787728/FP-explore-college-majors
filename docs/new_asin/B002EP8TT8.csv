8368009,4,B002EP8TT8,I rented the first disk on netflix years ago and on a whim desided to get the set. it started out kind of slow but by the time I had finished I found it rather entertaining. the ending takes a 180 from the first few episodes but it was still a good watch. probably not going to be a classic but a nice series to watch when your just looking for something.,1472860800,,355,3.9444444444444446

8368011,1,B002EP8TT8,Worst anime I ever seen.... DO NOT BUY!!!!! Only gave it one star because I could not give it less.,1404950400,,99,4.0
8368012,5,B002EP8TT8,"I saw it Youtube.  Good story but littile  sad. It's about a boy and a girl who in past life,  was in love. Thing is they can never stay together.",1384473600,2,146,3.8
8368013,3,B002EP8TT8,"Kanenone Academy had been an all boys high school until a coed integration experiment. Yusuke is the head of the welcoming committee and is surprised by Midori. Midori claims to be his lover from a previous life. The story follows the two as Midori as she tries to rekindle her former romance with Yusuke. There are also a lot of overly perverted boys that are trying to get it with the new female students.

This story is fun to watch, but it's one of the most perverted and over the top animes I've ever seen. There are some interesting characters and some emotional moments. Even so it's purely about fan service. The animation and the voice acting are both mediocre at best. On the up side it's a fairly cheap series. I was able to by it for $9.99. I would say it's probably worth that much just for the fun factor alone.",1354060800,2,825,4.392156862745098
8368014,5,B002EP8TT8,"All the other guys at his school totally spaz out over women but not the main dude. he is as cool as the otherside of a pillow. All the girls have crushes on the main dude as soon they bump into him and he doent lose his cool. plenty of fan service and at time a little to much male on male fan service but it was funny as hell.

By the end of the film he could have any girl he wanted. thats the way a harem works. The other stuff thats out there with the main dude is surrounded by beautiful women but none of them want him is wacked. thats not a harem thats frustrating.

This anime is cool. and i like cool.",1327881600,6,611,3.8412698412698414
8368015,4,B002EP8TT8,"Wow, while it has a lot of funny moments, hilarious even, some of the visual jokes come on hard and disturbing, or maybe I'm just in my PG-13 mode right now, lol!",1322265600,,162,4.09375
8368016,4,B002EP8TT8,"This show is all about the inappropriate humor.  Almost like it's mocking the fan service school comedies like Love Hina, it's very over the top.  I find the subtitles to be well done, nicely flowing translation.  My husband is a little less amused by this series than I am.",1305676800,6,274,4.551020408163265
