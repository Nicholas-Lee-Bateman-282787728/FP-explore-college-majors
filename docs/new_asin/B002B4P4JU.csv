8360664,5,B002B4P4JU,"needed it for preschool party day.  All classics, some a new classic (""Click Clack Moo"").  ""Corduroy"" is live action and preschool kids love love loved it.  Did a craft for it and watched on party day (approx. 10 mins long)  They begged for the other
shows and loved them all.  Bought it for Corduroy enjoyed them all!  There are others in the series, so check the contents before ordering to make sure you get the one you want. All of the movies other than Corduroy, are not action , but stills from pages from the book with perhaps a small movement here and there.  The kids were not thrown off, and enjoyed the content.
Very appropriate for ages 3-5.",1384473600,,653,4.436974789915967
