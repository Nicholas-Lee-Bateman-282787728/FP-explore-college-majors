7719043,5,B01DL6PBA8,"The entire trilogy is well done in terms of the stories, scripts, acting and direction.  Kudos on the photography, and location choice for shooting.  I would have never guessed Utah, even though I know the western United States well.  I love the quick shooting speeds within a scene.  Well done moving the viewer from one location to another, without losing the continuity.  Characters we'll developed.  I had a vested interest in all, even the villains.  Great wardrobes, and makeup.  Good job with the soundtrack.  Music is true to the genre.  The trilogy definitely left me wanting more.",1478390400,21,590,4.989690721649485

7719045,5,B01DL6PBA8,Good fantasy films are hard to come by. This one hits all the major elements.,1470268800,,77,4.2
7719046,5,B01DL6PBA8,One in a lesser known series.  Liken it to small budget Lord of the Rings.  Well done and surprisingly well acted.,1470182400,4,114,4.380952380952381
7719047,5,B01DL6PBA8,"This is a continuation of the story from the first Mythica.

In this story, our intrepid band gets back together to try and save the fighter from the first film who is being held hostage and daily tortured by the head of the thieves guild.

While out on assignment for the thieves guild, the team finds out that there are more vile forces at work.

Things are tied up (mostly) nicely by the end, but there is still the ultimate evil artifact, the Dark Spore, out there that will take two more films to see finished.",1469923200,5,515,4.34375
7719048,5,B01DL6PBA8,Great . Just waiting for the next one,1467417600,,37,3.75
7719052,5,B01DL6PBA8,"Awesome! Part 3 in the series.  This has become one of my favorite movies. It has it all-- great cast, great story, adventure, humor and romance. I love that it's produced by an independent film company too. The Mythica series is a must-see and worth bingeing on. Melanie Stone, Jake Stormoen, Nicola Pisner, and Adam Johnson bring the story to life.",1528329600,,350,4.737704918032787
7719053,5,B01DL6PBA8,Been seeing these movies last 4 days . this is what D and D should have been. I wish there where more movies to watch. they should have made a series for TV about it. Keeping the same actors. Despite what others think I love the rogue character.,1528329600,,245,4.125
7719054,5,B01DL6PBA8,This is a really fun movie series. I really am enjoying them.,1528070400,,61,4.166666666666667

7719057,5,B01DL6PBA8,"We got to see the deeper inner aspects of the characters in this entry as they continue the struggle against the forces of evil. The characters stepped away from the tropes this time and suffered various physical and emotional hurts for their actions. (One gripe: I understand the value of drama outweighing realism, but it still bugs me when people in mail get killed like they're wearing t-shirts instead of armor!) In any case this is a fine series and every fantasy roleplayer should see it.",1527379200,,495,4.767441860465116

7719062,4,B01DL6PBA8,"Yeah so I watched the first one, skimmed thru the second one and was interested enough to check this one out, just in the hopes of seeing more Matthew Mercer lol. I had forgot KEVIN SORBO is in this and I grew up watching Hercules and Xena and damn he really lent a lot of hard-earned talent to the cast.
Well worth the watch for a lot of reasons.",1525046400,,347,4.043478260869565
7719063,5,B01DL6PBA8,The best one so far>  I haven't seen  four or five yet but this one was really good.,1523664000,,84,3.611111111111111
7719064,5,B01DL6PBA8,"In a lot of film series, the ""middle movie"" is the weakest. Not so here. It's the best film of the series. After the epic conflict of the last film, this one starts out more street-level. Thane has been captured by Peregus, the guildmaster of thieves, and the rest of the team must render Peregus aid in running a drug across battle lines to secure his release. This is one of the most character-driven of the stories, and presents their most  direct confrontation with Szorlok, and... some pretty major changes.",1523577600,,512,4.688888888888889

7719067,4,B01DL6PBA8,"Low budget, but good sword and sorcery fun.  We watched it as there was nothing else that piqued our interest, but ended up really liking it.  We watched all five episodes over five nights, and enjoyed them all.  Good character development across all five movies, an epic Heroes Quest.

Loved the costumes and scenery!",1523145600,,318,4.833333333333333
7719068,3,B01DL6PBA8,"The third installment in the series, I found it to be nicely done and entertaining, considering it is a very low budget film. As one of her friends is held captive, Marik agrees to go on a mission to retrieve valuables in exchange for the release of her friend. She bands again with her fellow adventurers and goes on a new adventure, this time having better magic skills at her side.",1523059200,,384,4.422535211267606
7719069,5,B01DL6PBA8,Mythica rocks...Just watch it!!!,1522627200,,32,7.25
7719070,5,B01DL6PBA8,"Ok so the first two were excellent for the budget.  This one was just plain excellent.  A huge upgrade in the cinematics,  the acting seems so much more fluid and real, and  the cg and costumes were 10 times better.  I loved the first two, but on this one they've really found their footing.",1522281600,,291,4.314814814814815
7719071,5,B01DL6PBA8,I have Excellent experience,1522195200,,27,6.0
7719072,5,B01DL6PBA8,"The first and second were better, but this was good as the 3rd. Can't wait to watch the 4th and 5th. The storyline has a breathtaking continuity that you don't generally find. The special effects are top notch, impressive, and the music wasn't too loud. That's something I really hate in movies when you can't hear what the characters are saying. I love Kevin Sorbo; he's a gem and always adds panache to any movie he's in. He was in this one more than the first two.

Well developed characters, the pace was fast in most places, but I could do without so many fight scenes. Although, the one with the stone was excellent. Impressive acting, and their timing was spot on.",1521763200,,671,4.5
7719073,3,B01DL6PBA8,"Good movie!  About what  you would expect for the third in a series.  Not over the top but keeps with the storyline and  keeps you wanting more .
Just what anyone could ask for .  3 stars",1521676800,,187,3.945945945945946
7719074,1,B01DL6PBA8,"This is the worst so far in this series; A bad guy that controls Beetles, if you don't hear them say what they are you just see this guy playing with some large bug like a cockroach, REALLY!  I've figured out where they come from; they're dung beetles! HAH! There are 2 types of people that wear leather pants Rockstars and people in this film ;-) Could you imagine walking many miles in tight leather pants? Better yet fighting specifically kicking people, impossible! But it's as if they don't realize how bad the film is that's what makes it so hilarious, and sometimes unbearable. You cannot give this 4 or 5 stars it's too horrible!",1521417600,,637,4.539130434782609
7719075,3,B01DL6PBA8,"A bit of a let down from ""Quest for Heroes""  and ""Dark Spore"", especially the first half of this ""Threequille"" ! But if you stick it out a few things were well written and make it fun.
Hoping ""Iron Clown"" is going to pitch things into high gear and finish strong into ""GodSlayer"".  More individual character development has helped evolve those aspects, can't help but root for the lot of them.",1521331200,,393,4.52112676056338
7719076,4,B01DL6PBA8,"The Heroes of the saga are beginning to be noticed, and an old enemy captures one of their own to force the rest into taking up a mission to sate his avarice. But it seems fate has a hand in it for soon they will find themselves stumbling into the camp of the true enemy and push our heroes to their limits.

The fighting scenes start to shape up abit and while still a touch hokey are more entertaining to watch then previously. The acting and chemistry of the cast is very solid at this point with every one clearly comfortable in their roles and has a strong understanding of their characters. The world building keeps being added without excessive exposition and gives us a strange but interesting fantasy world where people mine for mold and talk to beetles.",1521158400,4,763,4.489208633093525
7719077,5,B01DL6PBA8,This is such a great story! I will now continue binge-watching this series....,1520726400,,78,5.076923076923077
7719078,5,B01DL6PBA8,"Most the stuff coming from Hollywood these days is void of imagination and bloated with identity politics to the point of ad nauseam. Thankfully this isn't one of those, this is a GREAT series. I give it FIVE stars for being refreshingly entertaining, imaginative and exciting while producing an overall relaxing enjoyable experience for the viewer. Great movie for all ages!",1520640000,4,375,5.163934426229508
7719079,4,B01DL6PBA8,"The plot for this movie (and its sequels) is actually really good.  The main 4 actors are pretty good as well. The graphic effects however are lacking,  but ok for this type of B-flick movie. I do have a problem with all the side quests/ fights that take place in each of these movies.  The main characters have a quest,  but then the story and their quest are mired down in a bog of bad guys and extra quests... there only needs to be 1 set of bad guys and one quest! And the characters need to have more of a back story,  it would be nice to know  more about them.",1520208000,2,566,4.008928571428571
7719080,5,B01DL6PBA8,I watched the entire series. A lot like Hercules type movies... i.e. Kevin Sorbo. It is a good story and the updated wardrobe creator did a better job than in the 90s.,1520035200,,167,4.25

7719086,5,B01DL6PBA8,"This is everything that the D&D movie should have been.

Classic characters that feel pulled straight out of the Players Handbook, small yet important quests, and the ever important Inn.

I really feel like I am watching a campaign develop, and characters grow, from 1st level to level 20.

Please, please, please! Continue this series, the little kid combing through D&D book imagining quests and campaigns, is fully satisfied by this series. The questionably mature adult, is also fully satisfied by this series.",1519257600,10,514,5.168674698795181
7719087,5,B01DL6PBA8,"Okay, so the Mythica series as a whole is sort of this cheesy B-movie fantasy series, but their budget clearly gets better as the story goes on, and we were hooked and watched all the movies in 2 days.  If you like fantasy movies, a definite must-watch.",1518912000,4,253,4.382978723404255

7719104,4,B01DL6PBA8,"First off, the 5-movie series is finished and available.  Its not sequels, its five chapters.  Amazon has the order mixed up.  The correct order to watch this incredibly entertaining 510 minute (8  hour) movie is:

Mythica: A Quest for Heroes
Mythica: The Darkspore
Mythica: The Necromancer
Mythica: The Iron Crown
Mythica: The Godslayer

The story has flaws, like all movies, but it is well told and suspenseful.  The Characters end up being rather complex and grow with the experiences they find themselves thrust into.  I thought the acting was fine and found myself rooting for all of them.  I binge watched the whole thing one rainy Saturday.  It was fun; the day flew by.  The story could have been told in less time, but then we would have less movie to get lost in.

Special note: The scenery was spectacular; I guessed New Zealand, but they claim its Utah.  Who knew Utah has places like that.",1495324800,51,902,4.705128205128205

7719127,1,B01DL6PBA8,"The high ratings this received are obviously from those invested in the film/series directly.  These are nothing more than B grade (if that) films.  If you notice with these films, it usually has about 25 people that just rave about the movie, then you watch it, and get the real thing, and it's extremely disappointing.  After watching the other Mytica movies, I couldn't stomach any more.  So be warned, these are nothing more than B (at best) level movies.  The dead giveaway, is Kevin Sorbo.  While I don't dislike the guy, he's always been in B movies and series.  This is definitely nowhere near even close to the level of something like Lord of the Rings.  The rating on this definitely needs to get adjusted to where it is sorely needed.  I would have given this two stars, but the fact that there are fake reviews planted to elevate the level of this, I'm giving it a one.  I'm sure those plants are people directly related to someone in the film or that worked on it, there's no doubt.",1487894400,4,995,4.5083798882681565

8756300,4,B01DL6PBA8,"This 3rd installment I liked better than the first two.  The acting was good and it had a storyline that was understandable.  I couldn't figure out who's who as all the bad guys looked like the same person to me and none were particularly scary.  The fight scenes we're better than the first two although there's still a 10 foot space between them as they swing their weapons clearly not even in range of one another a lot of the time.  I think they were trying to do force perspective to make it look like they were in front of one another but it wasn't working because they'd then show a distance view of a full swing which would clearly pass very safely by the defender.  These folks could have used a better fight coordinator.  The acting of all the major characters was much better than in the first two movies and especially the two guys showed much improvement.  Wasn't happy that my favorite character so far was lost.

You will have to watch the 1st two movies to get what's going on in this one.  It's not a great movie but it was still entertaining.

update: I'm a bit on the fence as to whether I liked this 3rd one or the 5th one the best.",1535673600,,1152,4.267281105990784

8756303,5,B01DL6PBA8,"The entire Mythica series is very entertaining---as far as I am concerned anyway. The one thing that stands out for me is the camaraderie between the actors in these films. I have watched many movies where these same actors have worked together in other movies and I have to say the Mythica series stands above the rest. As it is it is difficult for me to choose my favorite character/actor in the Mythica series. That said, I would love to see more of Melanie Stone and Nicola Posner in films, along with all of the supporting actors.",1530230400,,535,4.525773195876289
8756304,3,B01DL6PBA8,"This is about the best fantasy film I've watched that's seemed like someone's D&D campaign turned into a movie.  But, it does indeed seem like someone's D&D campaign turned into a movie. I will never consider movies in the aforementioned genre to be particularly good, but I don't expect them to be either. And, as I said, this is about the best of that ilk that I've seen so far.",1530144000,,380,4.428571428571429
8756305,5,B01DL6PBA8,Now this part of the series is good. It helps me understand what she is and in this one I think the chemistry between marek and dagen is alittle more clear. Overall its still good,1530144000,,179,4.142857142857143
