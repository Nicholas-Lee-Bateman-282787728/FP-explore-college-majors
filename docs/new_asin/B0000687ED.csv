1722561,5,B0000687ED,"The novella this opera is based on was called THE LAST ON THE SCAFFOLD.  I was very hesitant to buy this DVD because it's sung in English but the translation is so excellent and well suited to the musical line that I don't want to hear this opera any other way.  I have a ticket to see the Chicago Lyric Opera's first ever production this month and they will be singing it in French.  What a missed opportunity.  The first performance of CARMELITES in 1957 was sung in Italian.  The French version didn't premier until six months later.  In any language, this is an operatic gem and I don't understand why it's not a standard repertory piece in all the major opera companies.  It's based on a true story, has melodic music, drama, a mad scene and an emotional ending that packs a dramatic punch comparable to any other music written for the operatic stage.  The singing in this production is first rate.  Heather Begg as the Mother Superior is riveting, especially in her death scene.  Isobel Buchanan as Blanche is perfectly cast. Besides having a voice that can deliver all the notes and words clearly, she's truly believable as the mixed up adolescent.  I especially liked the director's touch of keeping us in suspense over her absence in the execution scene.  My ""favorite"" nun is Anne Maree McDonald as Sister Constance.  She is the sister who disciplined all of us in our religious classes when we were young.  And finally JOAN SUTHERLAND as Madame Lidoine. It was so great seeing her in a roll that wasn't in her standard repertory and singing so splendidly late in her career (1984) when this production was taped.  Her husband Richard Bonynge conducted and brought out all the beautiful colors of Poulenc's music from the Australian Opera Orchestra.  Any opera lover will want to add this DVD to their collection and be sure to pester your local opera company to perform this fantastic work more often.",1171238400,37,1912,4.696696696696697

Sung in English (no subtitles)

In this 1984 live performance at the Sydney Opera House, Sutherland reprises Mme Lidoine, the role she performed in the 1958 British premiere. This was clearly a case of cast-against-type, but even without the vocal pyrotechnics, Sutherland fans will not be disappointed .

While Sutherland is undoubtedly the big draw here,  this production is clearly not centered on La Stupenda (she doesn't even get a solo bow at the end). Virtually every role, including the bit parts, are cast with exceptional voices that make every scene memorable. The Marquis had a magnificent sound and his opening scenes with Chevalier were impressive. The ""Ave Verum"" of the Chaplain (Richard Greager) was deeply moving. Thierry (in a cameo by popular Australian performer Anthony Warlow) was appropriately creepy, and the 1st Commissioner (Gordon Wilcock) made the most as a swaggering bully.

For me, the most hair-raising performance was Croissy (Mother Superior) of Act 1. Lone Koppel (not Heather Begg as mentioned in some comments) pulled out all the stops to create the dying Croissy descending into madness. I had only heard the Crespin CD before this, and had no idea the role was so melodramatic. One can only wonder what Sutherland - whose Mad Scene in Donizetti's ""Lucia"" is practically legend - must have thought.

The climatic guillotine scene shows the scaffold but no sign of the guillotine itself. The scene is dimly lit and it's hard to see much of anything at first. The singers just walk down a path and off the stage. Blanche is not among the condemned at first. She watches from the crowd, then climbs up at the end to join her sisters in death.

The stage design and costuming appear appropriate for the time of the story (1790s Paris); this is not a ""modernized"" version in any respect.

There are no subtitles. Sutherland along with most of the other female singers is not easy to understand despite the English text. I happened to have a printout of the libretto for the 1958 recording with Crespin; the translation of that recording is actually quite similar to the words used in the Sydney production and was very helpful in following the DVD.

This DVD contains no bonus material.

Overall, an excellent opera video. Highly recommended.",1453420800,,2807,5.025862068965517
7963759,5,B0000687ED,"Dame Joan first sang this role at the operas British premiere in 1958, and reprised the role 28 years later. This is one of a trio of  operas about martyrdom that includes Pizettis Murder in the Cathedral as well as Halevys La juive, and by far the most moving of the three.  It is above all an ensemble effort.  Isabel Buchanan and Anne Marie McDonald are superb as Blanche and Constance, and Heather Begg sings a harrowing death scene as the old prioress.
But Sutherland is THE Madame Lidoine for all time, signing with total clarity and dignity.  I do not mind opera in English at all.  Kultur is as far down the pit as it can possibly get in terms of DVD production and marketing but . . . that will not deter me from buying their products if I consider them historical performances.",1400457600,,787,4.4
7963760,5,B0000687ED,"To all the folks complaining that this is in English - Poulenc wanted it performed in the VERNACULAR! In the year it premeired (1957) - it was sung in Italian at La Scala, in French at the Paris debut and in ENGLISH at the American debut at San Francisco Opera.",1384473600,6,261,4.24
7963761,1,B0000687ED,"I received an Amazon gift card for Father's Day and used towards two opera DVDs ($29.69 Pearl Fishers - I give it a 5 star rating).  But, this DVD should not be on the market if the others are like the one I purchased (the second half of the DVD was not playable except for about the last 15 minutes which was great! (The last 15 minutes was so good that I decided not to return the defective DVD to Amazon).  It may be that my DVD copy is only defective one in inventory?  And $19.93 is a great price for this opera and I feel that I actually got my (kids) money out of watching it!  Sorry about the one star rating but I think you can understand.",1371772800,,648,4.0
7963762,4,B0000687ED,"Alas, Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmelites has not fared well on DVD, and I have seen every available version.  (Curiously, it has double the number of recordings in that medium as it has on CD, where the original 1957 EMI version remains nonpareil.)  All others besides this one have suffered either from a directorial itch to substitute gimmicks for a straightforward presentation of the story (the final execution scene always being ludicrously botched), or else from excruciatingly poor vocal casting in one of the major roles.

This version is in English rather than the original French.  While I wold prefer the latter, the composer himself specified that he wanted the opera sung in the local language of wherever it would be performed, so the Sydney Opera's decision to perform it in English is amply justified.  A bigger and more just complaint, noted by others, is the lack of subtitles; even with the best diction, sung words are much harder to understand than spoken ones, especially in higher registers, and given a cast dominated by sopranos a good portion of the text is unintelligible.

The singing is generally good, though I have a couple of cavets.  The strongest cast member is Anne Maree McDonald, who practically steals the show as Sister Constance.  Isobel Buchanan comes next as a very fine if not superlative Sister Blanche.  Heather Begg is likewise an excellent Mother Marie (not the ""Mother Superior"" with a ""death scene"", as another person here mistakenly has stated; that scene belonging of course to Madame de Croissy).  The two relative weak links are Lone Koppel as a vocally somewhat overripe Madame de Croissy, and (sorry, fans of ""La Stupend"") the Madame Lidoine of Joan Sutherland.  Only a few years away from retirement, Dame Joan was canny enough here to cover some of her vocal weaknesses, but there is no denying that her once fabled upper register is only a shadow of its former glory, thin and noticeably unsteady.  (Of course, she has here no coloratura fireworks to execute that would expose the flaws more openly.)  Richard Bonynge (who else in the orchestra pit, with Sutherland on stage?) is a competent but not incisive or dynamic podium presence.

Thankfully, the staging is both eminently sensible and beautiful, and in the final scene makes the absolutely correct (indeed, only plausible) decision to have the nuns walk off stage to their deaths, instead of attempting (as in the aforementioned botched versions) to depict their deaths on stage by having them gag, roll their eyes, and fall in heaps, or similarly silly gestures that bear no relation to being guillotined.  Unless and until the Met FINALLY has enough sense to release its fabulous 1987 telecast, or unless you want to take a chance on the quality of a bootleg DVD available from various sources of a superb 1995 Tokyo staging conducted by Seiji Ozawa and starring Patrica Racette (who I will hear sing Sister Blanche at the Met two weeks from now), this is the Dialogues of choice on DVD.",1366502400,3,3005,4.934523809523809
7963763,3,B0000687ED,The problem with opera sung in English is how difficult it is to sing clearly. There are no subtitles offered on this DVD and I couldn't understsnd even half of the words sung. That spoiled the experience badly.,1359244800,6,211,4.578947368421052

7963765,3,B0000687ED,"I like Poulenc's music generally, not just his operatic material.  I must say, however, that I was disappointed in the staging and performance of this work.  Part of my unhappiness comes from the fact that the opera was sung in English - not French.  These were no sub/supertitles.  As anyone knows who has tried to understand what is being sung operatically, it's virtually impossible.  It certainly was the case here.  And yes, I am one of those people who believe that an opera should be sung in the language in which it was composed.  It has to do with the rhythm of the language and the impossibility of transmitting that rhythm to a different language.  That said, if you are one of the fans of Dame Joan's glorious voice, by all means get this production.",1347494400,2,762,4.592592592592593
7963766,5,B0000687ED,"Musical conception by R. Bonynge is excellent, considering M. Rosenthal (a good friend of Poulenc) and M. Plasson have probably done the definitive versions from the orchestral standpoint. All singers were excellent in their roles; Blanche de la Force was sung in a full-bodied manner by a full-bodied woman, a contrast to the way it has been cast in the past, and it  worked because the singer (Imogene Buchanan) got to the heart of the part. The delightful surprise was the great lyrico-coloratura Joan Sutherland in the rather understated part of Madame Lidoine, a true heroine by any measure. Despite some moments when enunciation (sung in English) was a problem, she nevertheless presented a loving portrait of this marvellous courageous woman. I did notice the translation was different from the one the Met used. Production by Elijah Moshinsky quite good; the female costumes might have been a little splendiferous for a relatively poor convent. One comment for future recordings: the singers sometimes got lost. I believe the Met has been miking their singers for recordings for some time, so that, for instance, when Blanche turns to go upstage to the guillotine, her words are not lost. Since this recording was 1984, this condition may have been corrected. Definitely worth having for Sutherland alone and bravo to Australian Opera for producing this work. Signed: P.K. Dennis",1203033600,10,1387,5.164444444444444
7963767,1,B0000687ED,"If you are not an opera fan and are thinking about buying this solely because Anthony Warlow is in it, you might want to think twice. Anthony plays the role of the footman and is in the show for literally less than one minute. (If you do have it, Anthony's minute is about 13 minutes into the first Act.) Granted, he is quite charming for the minute that he is there, but his appearance is too brief to justify the cost of the DVD.

Aside from Anthony, I found the opera quite dull and difficult to understand, which was exacerbated by the lack of subtitles. Perhaps if I could have made out more of what they were saying it would have been more interesting.",1200614400,4,658,4.306451612903226
