8510511,5,B0075BT5CG,"NOTE: If you want information about this particular edition of ""Aphrodite"" read on below in the section entitled: ""Product Review.""  My initial purpose on writing this review was to thank KABOOM for helping me with shipping problems.  However, I noticed that people were reading this review hoping to get information about the concert/disc itself.  In order to help them out, I re-wrote the review to include information about those subjects.

IMPORTANT: My five stars was for KABOOM's service in helping me with shipping problems, NOT for the disc.  For that read past the review of Kaboom's service to the section entitled, ""Product Review""  Thanks and sorry for those reading to get information about the disc  I hope the re-write will correct that problem.

Kaboom Service Review:

I ordered a copy of Kylie Minogue's London concert (the Spanish edition) since this is actually quite a fun way to improve my Spanish by reading the subtitles during the concert.

Due to difficulties beyond KABOOM'S control, the package got held up.  They put a tracer on it, and it got here in EXCELLENT shape and I am now enjoying it.

This is one of the very companies I've seen that actually puts tracers on stuff, locates stuff and then refunds you the shipping to boot!  (Since it came late they refunded it to me!)

So even though the Disc was late in coming, KABOOM still found it for me, got it here to me in great shape and then refunded me the shipping!

I'd gladly order from them again.

PRODUCT REVIEW:

Now to the product itself.  This is basically a knock-off of the original Parlophone/Emi Blink T>V> Sky 3D Blu Ray.  I got it strictly as a curiosity (I like collecting Kylie Minogue stuff.)  It's NOT a new concert, it's NOT a different concert, it's NOT a concert in Spain.  It's the London concert re-packaged in Mexico for a Hispanic audience.

As such it's severely edited.  I'm not sure why, maybe censorship laws?  For example, ""Spinning Around"" is missing.  Cut scenes are missing.  The entire concert is broken up with headers which differentiate the songs.  When the disc was burned they did something with the aspect ratios and it gives you some weird angles...but it's NOT different camera angles.

As a side note, I used to live in Germany and a similar thing happened with the initial German version of ""Star Wars.""  I have a bunch of German souvenirs from that time and they are different spins on the very same American version...but not that different.

Sadly this isn't Kylie singing in Spanish either.  The subtitles are fun, but they sometimes act weird too.  Also unless you can read enough Spanish to decipher the instructions you'd better NOT order this.

As for the product itself, I'd only give it three stars.  Hey, the concert ""Aphrodite"" is still a FIVE STAR excellent experience, but the Spanish re-packaging is not going to be to everybody's taste.  But if you're a Kylie Minogue collector and want different versions of the SAME concert, this is the Mexican re-package.  But you need to understand enough Spanish to operate the disc, otherwise you might get somewhat frustrated trying to make it work.  This DOES work on American Blu-ray players, but it's temperamental.

If you're not a collector, then save your money, get the original.  This isn't a different concert...just a re-package.",1396396800,,3325,4.8487544483985765
8510512,2,B0075BT5CG,"After doing a little research and coming across the other reviews here I can say this is not a bootleg because is being sold at big retailers in Mexico. I did not purchase it, so I can't really tell you more about it, but definitely not a bootleg.

Is it official? Probably, but definitely misleading cover in english to make it look ""imported"" here in mexico, probably the people who bought it can find spanish fine print.",1392681600,2,423,4.4935064935064934
