The plot is rather predictable and there are few surprises, but Joel McCrea is such a good actor that he elevates the rather mediocre script. The titular gunfight takes place in the final five minutes of the movie, and is anti-climatic. However, there are things to enjoy in the movie, such as good character development and some well-filmed action scenes. All of the standard Western cliches are present, and the film certainly breaks no new ground as later Westertns would, but it's still worth watching at least once, especially for the underrated Joel McCrea.",1215043200,20,647,4.785714285714286

Directed by Joseph M. Newman

With Gene Barry already riding the TV western range as legendary gunfighter-turned-lawman Bat Masterson, independent producer Walter Mirisch hired Joel McCrea to play a rather less-dandified version in this Cinemascope western. When his brother Ed (Harry Lauter) is cowardly shot in the back and killed, Bat accepts the offer to run for county sheriff against the corrupt Jim Regan (Don Haggerty), only to learn that the real killer is someone entirely different. Not wanting the job of sheriff in the first place but only accepting to please a lady friend, Pauline Howard (Julie Adams), Bat willingly breaks the law to aid an old friend (Walter Coy), almost losing both his position and his life in the ensuing shootout.

Special footnote: -- Julie Adams and McCrea do a great job. Their performances are really the chief reasons for you to watch this. McCrea was a subtle and effective actor, and here he foreshadows his work in the legendary ""Ride The High Country"" a few years later.  Joel was in his latish fifties when the film was made, and it would have been a sad swan song for an usually-watchable actor; thank goodness he went onto make ""Ride the High Country"". This was to be the final film made by McCrea in his career. Good thing, Peckinpah saved him from this sad goodbye.

3128041,4,B0014BJ1E0,"In this 1959 film Bat Masterson states at the very outset that he is reluctant to engage in a gunfight and kill people; but despite his good intentions, he is drawn into several fights. An army sergeant is in love with a girl who happens to mention Masterson, and provokes the sergeant's jealousy. The sergeant tries to kill Masterson, but Masterson kills him instead. Now both the sergeant's brother and the sergeant's army buddies are out to get him.

 Masterson goes to Dodge City where his brother is running against the incumbent sheriff who is aligned with outlaws. Masterson buys a share in a saloon. The sergeant's brother comes to Dodge City and kills Masterson's brother in revenge, but Masterson thinks that the renegade sheriff was the murderer. Masterson runs for sheriff and needs to find a way to rid the town of the rowdies. Two women vie for his affection. There is an attempted rape of one of the women. He is drawn into helping a retarded boy who was found guilty of murder and is scheduled to be hung. All in all, the film keeps the viewer's interest and is very good for a 1959 western.",1293408000,3,1107,4.585858585858586

3128043,3,B0014BJ1E0,"""The Gunfight at Dodge City"" was one of many Western made by the great Joel McCrea, one of those actors who seemed born to play Western characters. He made several outstanding, many that were pretty good, and some that were at best, fair to middling.

This film falls into the fair to middling category. This fictionalized account of how gambler/gunfighter Bat Masterson became the marshal in Dodge City is uninvolving and takes too many shortcuts with logic and believability. Masterson becomes marshal when his brother is killed, but when the killer is discovered and is shot down by Masterson, the revelation of the killer's identity is regarded as an afterthought. Also, Masterson breaks the law by breaking the mental challenged brother of his friend Ben Thompson out of jail with very little regard for how that will affect his standing as a lawman. This device was used in other films like ""The Law and Jake Wade,"" but to much better effect than in this film.

The movie is not horrible, but it's just not very good.",1223769600,5,1023,4.806818181818182
