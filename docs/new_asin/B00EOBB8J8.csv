5929800,5,B00EOBB8J8,"I love this video. Julie has just the right amount for someone somewhat new to yoga but someone who is in decent shape. I found this video after watching Ladies of London on Bravo and seeing her amazing figure. I've tried other videos that are too slow, this one has great flow and burns a lot of calories, but isn't too long.",1414713600,7,326,4.274193548387097
8607371,5,B00EOBB8J8,"I like the variety of Yoga poses and it's easy to learn/follow along. The great thing about Yoga at home is you can go according to your pace, and if there are poses that are not good for your hip/knee, improvise and do other great poses in place of them.",1501804800,,255,4.12
8607372,5,B00EOBB8J8,Wonderful presentation. Inspiring. Easy to follow. Julie Montagu is a wonderful teacher. Love it,1469577600,,96,5.928571428571429
8607373,5,B00EOBB8J8,This is the absolute best yoga detox and strengthening course I've ever found! Julie Montagu is very knowledgeable and gives you the best tips for keeping on track! She's my absolute favourite yogini and would love to take a class with her!,1459036800,,240,4.738095238095238
8607374,3,B00EOBB8J8,"The reviews I read gave this DVD 5 stars. It's ok, but not what I expected. Not completely thrilled with this purchase.",1452729600,,119,4.454545454545454
8607375,5,B00EOBB8J8,Excellent for starters !!!,1447632000,,26,5.75
8607376,5,B00EOBB8J8,I have only done the 28 minute program so far but I am loving it.  I find the way she describes criteria for a proper pose to be really easy to follow & remember.  Nice yoga workout that makes me feel amazing and relaxed.,1447459200,2,221,4.0
8607377,5,B00EOBB8J8,"Julie Montagu's DVD is actually not just one workout but 3, and she also has a few quick tutorials about healthy eating, weight loss, and the benefits of power yoga. I originally bought this DVD strictly for the workout portion, and I had no intention of trying to actually follow the 21 day detox and weight loss part of it. While I still have a two pounds of baby weight to shed I feel like I have healthy eating down. For the sake of the review I watched Julie's tutorials and I'm glad I did! Not only were they inspiring but they were full of information that I hadn't known before. I knew I loved yoga for the way it made my body look and my mind feel but, I wasn't aware that so many poses benefited your internal organs. If you are looking to jump start weight loss or get healthy, I have no doubt that following her workout and eating regimen will do it (I might even have to try it before The Cowboy and I head to Vegas next year).

As far as the workouts go...they are pretty amazing. This DVD is probably not the best choice for beginners, if I had to rate it on a scale of 1-10 (10 being a yoga master) I'd give it a 7. It's not as intensive as Jillian Michaels Yoga Inferno DVD but, you really need to be familiar with your Yoga poses, breathing, and the right posture to be able to follow along.

30 Minute Cardio Power Yoga This one was amazing. I was so proud of myself that I could hang in there for this whole workout, even keeping my breathing tempo the same as hers. I liked that for each series she built upon the first one, and the flow of the poses kept my muscles working but didn't strain them. Her commentary is brief but encouraging and helpful.

40 Minute Cardio Power Yoga Who would have thought that 10 minutes more could make a workout so much harder? I loved this series for the same reasons as the 30 minute one but, Julie takes it up a notch with this one. Not only are the poses a bit faster but she challenges you with more balance and core work. Towards the end I found myself having trouble keeping focused on my breathing and even toppled over a few times with the Eagle Pose. I look forward to doing this one more and mastering those trickier series!

7 Minutes Core Power Workout Not to be cocky but I wasn't too nervous about this one. I just ran my first 15K this month and have almost met my weight and fitness goals...Let me tell you, I was looking at the clock praying that the workout was almost done only to see that I still had 4 more minutes. This is HARD, or at least it was for me. No wonder Julie has suck a rocking body. She did this series without breaking a sweat or having a single muscle twitch. I'm nothing if not determined, and I'm going to be counting on all my Prairie Wife grit to help me master this one! Trust me it's worth the 7 minutes to do it a few times a week, I'm super excited to see how this workout changes my body!

If your looking for a way to keep yourself healthy and motivated through these next few colder months this is the perfect DVD for you. Not only do I recommend it for the workouts but, for the great nutritional information as well.",1446163200,19,3123,4.163907284768212
