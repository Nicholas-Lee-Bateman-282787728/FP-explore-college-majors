[ASIN:B000A1IL9G Mother Teresa: In the Name of God's Poor]]
This is by far the best Mother Teresa movie I have ever seen. It especially
captured that period of history & how Mother Teresa came to realise her calling in the name of Gods poor in the slums of strife torn Calcutta.",1219968000,6,280,4.403846153846154
914172,4,6304684681,"At the suggestion of a friend from Kerala, India,I purchased this movie. Watching with a friend, we found it historically well placed and apparently well balanced. My only regret is there were no scenes from Mother Teresa's funeral, which was a State funeral,with a procession beginning at the School of the Sisters of Loretto, and ending at the Missionaries of Charity Mother House.",1189468800,24,383,5.095238095238095

914175,5,6304684681,A Hallmark/Family Channel production.  You will totally enjoy all 93 minutes of this movie!  This is Mother Teresa's story of helping the poor in Calcutta India.  The acting is fantasic! It looks like it is filmed on location. This is a must buy for your collection!,985824000,14,266,4.739130434782608
914274,5,6304684681,"This is a beautifully done film about Mother Teresa's work.  Geraldine Chaplin gives an exquisite portrayal of the soon-to-be saint, and I was moved to tears in several scenes.  Granted, this film doesn't delve into Mother Teresa's life (the 2003 film with Olivia Hussey does), but I think that in Ms. Chaplin's extraordinarily capable hands, Mother's true essence shines through.",1456099200,,380,5.316666666666666
914275,3,6304684681,This Mother Teresa DVD is not as well done as the one with Olivia Hussey but it is good but not as good as the other one not as in depth.,1455753600,,137,3.4516129032258065

914277,5,6304684681,"I wanted to learn of Mother Teresa's life before she became famous and what caused her to work among the poor of Calcutta and ultimately become a candidate for Sainthood in the Catholic Church.  I wish we all could possess some of the compassion she felt for the poor and homeless.
I was very pleased with this film of her life. Susie Q",1454198400,2,336,4.333333333333333

914420,5,6304684681,"I was looking for DVD's that showed the work of Mother Teresa.  I ordered one and it was more of a documentary rather than a story of her work. The age group I wanted to view it would have found it very boring.  I've always been interested in Mother Teresa and her work in Calcutta.  I ordered this DVD and it was wonderful.  I got it to show to a group of 6th -12th grade girls at a retreat this fall.  It will help them understand what it means to dedicate your life to helping those less fortunate than themselves. It is a lesson for all of us, regardless of age. I recommend it highly.",1346371200,13,589,4.086956521739131
914421,5,6304684681,"Probably the greatest missionary or catechetical tool of today would have to be Mother Teresa. She exemplifies what Christianity and the Bible are all about and epitomises the life and teachings of Christ.

This movie brought me to tears and I encourage you to share it with Christians and non-Christians alike.

Also recommend Mother Teresa by Petrie and The Legacy by the same.

Truly a Blessed Woman.",1346112000,,403,4.985074626865671
914422,5,6304684681,I enjoy this movie and admire Mother Teresa for answering her calling so dedicated and determined to her cause. She was a great and admirable lady. I hope God bless me with that kind of determination to help my fellow man.,1305244800,,222,4.439024390243903

914425,5,6304684681,This movie about MT is the best version out there and it is very well done. I got mine here for very low price and it was brand new still in the wrapper and I watch it in HDTV with an up-convert HD-DVD player but the DVD is not HD. But that is no complaint as this is the best version of Mother Teresa's story starting as a Nun and working alone in the slums and slowly growing into the Mother and getting the Peace Prize. This is the kind of movie that inspires those that watch it.,1251676800,6,483,3.938775510204082
914426,5,6304684681,"There are two movies of the same subject matter out there and I believe this was the first. This one seems to go into the ministry of Mother Teresa a little more: what moved her and things that went on in her relationships - with God, her superiors, and others.

As an evangelical I was moved by the authenticity of MT's faith and relationship with God. This movie is very inspiring for anyone from any Christian faith background, and probably others, as this single person allowed Jesus to live in her and touch others.",1247270400,27,520,4.531914893617022
