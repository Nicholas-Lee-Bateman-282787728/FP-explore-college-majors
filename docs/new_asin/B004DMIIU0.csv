8425706,5,B004DMIIU0,"Very good series, enjoyed it very much. I received part 2 first, so I had to wait for part 1 so I could start to enjoy the episodes. Fast delivery.",1386460800,,147,3.933333333333333
8425707,3,B004DMIIU0,"if you enjoy anime this is worth watching but don't expect anything above average. Typical in all respects, just take it for what it is.",1364860800,,136,4.48
8425708,3,B004DMIIU0,The second part of the title has good. The storyline of the title is good and some of it is funny.,1347840000,,98,3.7142857142857144
8425709,2,B004DMIIU0,"First a foremost, I bought this on a whim.  I had no idea what this anime was about, didn't check out any other reviews, just wanted a surprise.  Boy did I get one...

Story:  Was alright the first, um, 2 episodes, then it just never picked up and went south...fast.  You won't care for the characters at all...AT ALL.  There are just way too many characters, none of them are developed, just totally shallow and pointless.  One positive note was the occasional funny bickering of the lead guy and two of the lead girls...but that's it.

Animation:  Not good.  Just not good.  There are a few fight scenes, and even then the animation is lackluster.

Overall:  Just not good!

Save your money and buy something else.  This was a waste of time, patience, and money. I'm surprised I even made it to the end.",1314662400,,805,4.493055555555555
8425710,4,B004DMIIU0,"The second half of Chrome Shelled Regios wraps up the these early experiences of Layfon, Felli, Nina and the rest of this fun cast. Filled with slightly overwrought drama, plenty of angst, and the right amount of fun battle scenes, Chrome keeps up the level of entertainment while remaining bloody confusing. A few plot twists are finally explained (like who are the people with the awful English pronunciation? and what the heck are those glowing spirit things that look remarkably like Kirin?), but many more remain unresolved - leaving ample room for follow up stories and seasons! Which one of the girls sweet on Layfon will eventually end up with him? Will Layfon deal with his inner demons and past and ever be able to return home? Where the hell is this all taking place in anyway?

Overall, for all its confusion, Chrome is a fun series taking place in an imaginatively constructed world. The characters are fun, if occasionally ponderous, and the antics and interactions keep the rhythm of plot and character development at a pace that will keep you watching. This isn't at the level of an FMA or Samurai 7 in terms of anime ""high art"", but is certainly worth the time of any serious fan. and seeing Felli finally smile is worth the whole experience, am i right?",1303689600,10,1271,4.725225225225225
