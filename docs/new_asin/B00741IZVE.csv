5053650,1,B00741IZVE,here again very dissopointed not a film if you have some as a film we would be interested thanks jeanette,1367452800,,105,4.3
5053651,5,B00741IZVE,"These 4 disk's each show a differnt aspect to the training of the Elite Navy Seal's.
Well worth the money if you would like to gain a slight insight into what the Seals go through whilst traing to be one of the Elite.

Also includes dialogue from the Seal command and allows one to begin to understand the minset needed to dedicate your life to becomming a Seal.",1358726400,,362,4.323529411764706
5053652,1,B00741IZVE,"Although assured by the Military Channel and Discovery Channel that this DVD was the program I was looking to purchase (program aired on Military Channel as ""Secrets of the Navy Seals""), this was not the correct program and a complete waste of my money.",1356048000,,253,4.7727272727272725
5053653,4,B00741IZVE,In my opinion not the best Navy Seal DVD out there but still a very good set of DVDs about the Seals. Good explanation about some of the weapons and vehicles used by the seals today and lots of actions of seals in training. Well worth it.,1342396800,,238,4.085106382978723
5053654,4,B00741IZVE,"I bought this 4 DVD set at Fred Myer for about 12 bucks. The shows are all about 55 minutes long. The footage is I'd guess from around the late 90's. The narrator is the recognizeable voiced guy from ""Frontline."" There is some interesting stuff on each disc, and they are pretty enjoyable to watch. Nothing super spectacular or anything, but still fun to watch. Weapons and tactics demonstrations and shooting. Good interviews with former SEALs. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Navy SEAL shows or military buffs. For a $12 investment, you really don't have much to lose by picking this up! The episode which profiles Hell Week is NOT the same as Discovery's ""BUD/s Class 234,"" which I also own, which is GREAT also. The class profiled is Class 190something. If you liked that show, then you'll probably like this!

BONUS is that the packaging and DVD's are MADE IN THE U.S.A!!",1341878400,4,888,4.6923076923076925
5053655,5,B00741IZVE,"If you are a military buff with a particular interest in US Naval Special Warfare, chances are you will enjoy this set. I managed to record (on my VCR, at the risk of dating myself) 2 of these Discovery channel programs when they aired 12 years ago, and it's great to finally have them on disc. This is an excellent glimpse into the world of the SEALs- probably the closest a filmaker will be able to get, especially these days. There is quite a bit of shared footage between the shows, but each episode has its own theme so there is always new information. The Hellweek episode is particularly fun- I think I enjoy it just as much, if not more, than the Class 234 Hellweek episode- though I bet that I'm the only one who feels that way! Instructor Kelm is the man, by the way.

There's a bit of extra footage on all 4 to fill in the gaps and make them each 50 mins.

All in all, for this price it is beyond worth it for a buff to add it to his/her collection.",1339372800,9,960,4.128342245989304

These folks are the anarchist and terrorist worst nightmare.  Without telling too much we get to see why Special Forces like the U.S. Navy SEALS are so good at their job and why in a world gone berserk these folks are needed and will always have a place in today's world and the future.  Good stuff.",1335657600,10,641,6.517647058823529
