1231097,3,B00000IYR0,"This movie provided Liz Hurley with her big break.  Soon after this, Dennis Potter snapped her up for the lead role in the BBC adaptation of Christabel Bielenberg's 'The Past is Myself'.  She became Hugh Grant's girlfriend and the rest is history.  She transformed herself physically during her twenties, which is why some viewers have had problems identifying the occasionally nude actress that appears here as the very slim Liz Hurley they now know.
For me, 'Aria' was the classical music community's response to the rise of MTV and the pop video.  Directors like Ken Russell and Nick Roeg wanted to show us that opera could be equally colourful and sexy, even if you couldn't dance to it.  And they proved their case, to my mind.
But like a pop video, you wouldn't want to watch this too often.  There's no substantive connection between each of the videos, so you end up feeling much the same as you would after a 90-minute immersion in MTV.",1028678400,34,945,4.696969696969697
1231098,5,B00000IYR0,"Aria is 90 minutes of pure wonderment -- I'm not certain what demographic this project was aimed at, but I definitely fall into it. You have to love opera style music yet not be so attached to the operas themselves that the re-presentation of the music offends. You have to enjoy video that your average couch potato won't get, no matter how many mind altering drugs he takes.
To really enjoy Aria, you have to check your expectations at the door and accept it for what it is -- a set of brilliant visual explorations fueled by some of the most incredible music ever written. With any other attitude, you're far more likely to find this a miserable experience. Too vulgar, too highbrow, too bizarre, too surreal, too whatever.
Some pieces tell a solid story, ranging from humorous to tragic. Others lack story line and speak to a different level of consciousness. Pathos. Humor. Death. Life. Celebration. Brilliance. Aria cleanses windows of perception, like a good wine between courses of a meal. On the other hand, it's a main course, in and of itself.
This is not fodder for young children, and most teens won't have the patience for it either. If you thought ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" was a brilliant movie, perhaps you'd better pass on this one as well. I only wish that more Wagner had been included ... perhaps an Aria II consisting solely of Wagner arias?

1231099,4,B00000IYR0,"Take 10 well known opera arias then ask 10 established or up and coming directors to interpret them visually in any manner they choose. Either a collection of opera videos or modern day silent shorts with musical accompaniment, take your pick. What you end up with is a film that ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous.

Each person must judge for themselves which segments work best for them. My favorite episodes were directed by Ken Russell, Bruce Beresford, Franc Roddam, and Derek Jarman. My favorite arias used were by Korngold, Verdi, Lully, and Leoncavallo. In only one instance (Bruce Beresford's interpretation of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's DIE TOTE STADT) do the video and the audio coincide.

As a devotee of silent movies, I am always drawn to films that attempt to tell their stories visually. Just as music is a key element in silents so it is with ARIA. When it was first released the movie did not satisfy opera purists and the music video crowd didn't care for it either which is a shame on both counts. ARIA is visually ravishing and the music is superb. It's just not for all tastes. This 2008 re-release is the same as the 2002 one.",1000771200,4,1155,4.684729064039409

Each of 10 directors, including Robert Altman, Bruce Beresford, Jean-Luc Godard and Ken Russell, created a vignette around a well-known opera piece.

1231117,5,B00000IYR0,"I saw this film when it first came out in the theaters and a recent viewing on DVD only confirms my initial opinion that it's a masterpiece, though a flawed one. So I've been baffled by the abuse heaped upon it over the years by critics and viewers and decided to finally air my own thoughts and what I feel may be the reasons for said abusel

My take on this film differs from others. First, I'm convinced that in order to fully appreciate it you have not only to love opera but see it as something essential to your life. Furthermore, you must also be willing to agree and identify with the viewpoint of the films' creators: that this all-consuming passion places an opera lover's estate in today's world in a cultural time warp.

Though there aren't many out there who fit this description, I feel it accurately defines the demographic of Aria's target audience. I also believe that producer Don Boyd and any others who conceived of the daring idea for this film, and whose job it was to make ten scenes written and directed independently by different people somehow ""coalesce,"" knew exactly what they were doing, even though the project seems occasionally to have gone awry. (The episodes using recordings of Baroque opera, directed by Jean luc Goddard and Robert Atman, though interesting in themselves, seem bafflingly out of place)

Most of the episodes were cleverly organized to achieve both a cumulative musical effect and further the film's dramatic theme, which is gradually unveiled by the entre'acte activities of the seemingly enigmatic character portrayed by John Hurt who keeps showing up between episodes. A kernel of that theme arrives in the very first episode, a 20th Century reenactment of the assassination of a king as portrayed in Verdi's ""In Ballo Maschera"" (playing on the soundtrack). But contrary to Verdi, where a diffident king dies without resistance in the arms of his beloved, and in glorious song, Nicholas Roeg has his protagonist unexpectedly defend himself, shooting all of the would-be assassins dead, and thus confounding his significant other.

With the exception of Bruce Beresford's take of ""Die Tote Stadt,"" none of the other episodes are dramatically faithful to their operas. Instead most seem  designed to reflect an absurd disparity between the romantic sentiments of dead composers from past centuries playing on the soundtrack and the glaring realities of an every-day world gone mad: homeless children roving the streets (""La forza del destino""); a couple's disastrous attempt to cheat on their spouses at a sex-themed resort (""Rigoletto""); teens slashing their wrists under the neon glitz of Las Vegas (""Tristan and Isolde""), etc.

As the episodes progress, the film's concern with death --- grand opera's favorite obsession --- becomes overriding. Also, recorded excerpts of busy operatic ensembles give way in the later episodes to arias sung by a single voice.

The penultimate episode, directed by Derek Jarmon, forms arguably the film's dramatic climax. A single, radiant old woman, dressed in a frayed, gossamer stage costume and lit from above, is seen bowing over and over as accolades of flower pedals rain on her from on high. The beatific vision is accompanied by the aria ""Depuis le jour"" from ""Luise,"" sung by a mellifluous Leontyne Price. The woman personifies opera itself, old and tattered but reveling in her memories, taking one last bow as she bids a splended farewell to her loving and appreciative audience, unseen but undoubtedly as wrinkled and antediluvian as she.

And then the final episode, in which John Hurt mimes Leoncavallo's Canio singing ""Vesti la giubba."" As was the old woman, he too represents opera --- or perhaps the opera-loving audience itself --- over-the-top, pouring his heart out  to a single, female audience member in an otherwise empty opera house. Close-ups of the woman reveal her barely concealed scorn for the singer. And when she too leaves, the abandoned man falls dead, the victim of, yes, a ""broken heart!"" Only a true opera lover could identify with such a heightened display.

Up to now the music used by each director had been made by recent opera stars in contemporary-sounding recordings: Price, Bergonzi, etc. But perhaps to highlight the theme of opera's passed parade, this final episode is accompanied using Pagliacci's celebrated aria sung by Enrico Caruso in a recording made nearly a century ago. It may be possible that the relevance of opera as social expression  has in fact died longer ago than even the films' creators had imagined?",1364342400,5,4556,5.045212765957447

1231120,4,B00000IYR0,"<strong>Aria</strong> (Ken Russell et al., 1987)

Anthology films are a tough beast, and especially in America, we're not quite sure what to do with them. (The Asians are still churning out excellent anthologies like <em>Rampo Noir</em> and <em>4bia</em>.) Even at their best, anthology films in the western world are usually a mixed bag. <em>Aria</em>, while still fitting this description pretty well, is the least mixed-bag of them I've seen from American/European directors in recent memory. When it is good, it is very, very good, and when it is bad, it's... less bad than it could have been.

Ten directors make ten short films about sex, each attached to a particular aria (and each named for the opera from which the aria is taken). Some are comedic (Julien Temple's ""Rigoletto"", one of the film's true high points), some melodramatic (Robert Altman directs a meta piece tied to ""Les Borades"", also excellent). A lot of them, to me at least, were surprises indeed; both of the pieces I've mentioned were some of the director's best work I've seen. Some I expected to be great, and they were (Derek Jarman). Some I expected to be awful, and they were (Godard, who has never been more than useless). But the upsides here vastly outweigh the downsides; Godard's segment is the only one that's truly unlikeable here, and while the others vary in quality, all of them are at least worth watching. Some are a great deal more than that. Ken Russell's, especially, may have been his final spark of greatness, a last glimpse of the art-for-art's-sake director who would soon go the way of the great auk.

It's all very pretty, and most of it is kind of brilliant, examining its subject from a number of different angles--almost all of them worth your time. If you've never had the chance, give it a look--it's quite fine. ****",1335484800,6,1825,4.824281150159744
1231121,5,B00000IYR0,Had this at one time on vhs but the quality was bad. The wife liked it so i thought i try the version on dvd. Its surprisingly clear and the sound is great. One review thought it was blurry and the sound somewhat distorted i didn't find this to be true. For the price i am very satisfied.,1324339200,4,288,3.9827586206896552
1231122,2,B00000IYR0,"just watched this movie twice through....maybe I am missing something, but I did not like most of it.....I would say that I sort of hated it, with the following exceptions....the music was nice, therefore I gave it the 2 stars.....I thought the two best vignettes were: die tote stadt; scenery inside and out was very good, but not the actors, the music was nice, and depuis le jour; scenery again, plus actors and music)....didn't care for the liebestod segment with bridget fonda...thought it was gruesome...I did like the one with the kids in it, la virgine degli angeli (music and the photography was interesting)...the rest of the segments I did not care for and would probably not watch this again.",1319328000,,704,4.875
1231123,3,B00000IYR0,"I vaguely remember watching the 'Nessun Dorma' short years ago, but never really knowing what the movie was that I was watching. I'd had to go shortly after the piece ended, so I never got the chance to check my cable's viewer guide. (This was before the comcast digital cable & the 'info' button came into my life.)

Aria is a project where several directors were asked to interpret opera arias, with the results giving many different results. Some directors chose to set their pieces during different points in history while others chose more modern settings, such as the setting of Nessun Dorma or the piece about men in a brothel.

I'd enjoyed the Nessun Dorma piece when I was younger, so I was sure that I'd love or at least like the rest of the film. Not so. For me the film ran between dull and semi-interesting. Some of the pieces (the brothel piece) were pretty funny to watch while one was unintentionally hilarious- the piece with the two nude lovers made me laugh unexpectedly due to the bad lipsynching done by the pair as well as the relative disinterest on the man's face. Liz Hurley did a decent job with expressions, but sadly lip synching just wasn't her strong point. Even though I was occasionally bored by this film, I can't deny that some of the images in this film were striking.

(On a side note, it was interesting to see how many stars were in this movie & would later make it big. People such as Liz Hurley, Tilda Swinson & someone that looked a little like Ewan McGregor.)

The bottom line is that this film isn't going to be for everyone. For some, they'll look at it & say ""but that's not how I interpreted this aria"". For others, they'll get bored by how some of the pieces just seem to take forever to complete. Others will be a little turned off by how completely random these pieces are. This is pretty much something I'd recommend as a rental rather than a purchase.",1274313600,,1902,4.472622478386167
1231124,5,B00000IYR0,"Although I have extensive musical experience as a classically trained singer, I think that even the novice appreciater of opera will find ""Aria"" appealing. The concept for ""Aria"" is compelling. Ten directors each make a short film using music from opera that has moved them in some way. As with any compilation of shorts, some do a better job than others. The five star review at the outset means that I think the best shorts of the bunch are worth buying the entire DVD. I will review each short separately.
The short films in this series can be catagorized in several ways. There are films that use excerpts from an opera to tell its film ""story"", while others use only a single composition. There are films where the visual story takes precedence and the music ""accompanies"", whereas others have the music as the star.
Images from Bill Bryden's short film are interspersed between each of the others giving the viewer a marker for when one film ends and another begins and this creates a story arc through the whole compilation which culminates at the end. (I will review Bill Bryden's film last.)

1. ""Un ballo in maschera"" (4 & 1/2 stars) - Dir. Nicolas Roeg uses excerpts from Verdi's opera to tell the story of a lustful Albanian monarch (played by actress Theresa Russell in a pants role!) wooing a young Baroness in Vienna while exiles plot to assasinate him. Those of you who know the Verdi opera will recognize the opera's plot mirrored in the film. I delighted in attention to details like the double-headed eagle (Albania's national symbol) over the entrance of the embassy.(Yes, I am Albanian.) The film succeeds in telling its story while allowing the music to carry us along. (Warning for brief partial nudity)

2. ""La forza del destino"" (5 stars) - The lovely aria, ""La Virgine degli Angeli"", performed by Leontyne Price, is clearly the star in Charles Sturridge's tragic black & white short about three young children and gives the film its needed emotional impact, particularly at the end. (Incidentally, the beautiful voice of Leontyne Price was featured in the previous film also and two other films later.)

3. ""Armide"" (1 star) - Jean Luc Goddard's short left me scratching my head going ""Huh?"". Two comely young cleaning ladies flit about, sometimes nude, through a gym and are ignored by the very muscular gym rats. The music would fade in and out to be replaced with the sound of the work-out machines in use. I found this distracting and annoying. The unfamiliar music (though not displeasing for me) and the images it accompanied did not fit well. Takes only ten minutes, but it was too long. Couldn't wait for it to end. By far, the stinker of the bunch.

4. ""Rigoletto"" (4 stars) - This one is the comedy and it works well. A film producer (Buck Henry) leaves his sick wife (Anita Morris) at home to go scout a location, but he is really going to rendez-vous with a sexy blond (Beverly D'Angelo) at a resort hotel that has ""theme rooms"". Unbeknownst to him, his wife has her own date with her tall handsome paramour at the same hotel. Near misses abound. Dir. Julien Temple uses several ""oners"", long continuous takes with no cuts, to propel his tale. Watch out for the Elvis impersonator. Its inclusion and the music that goes with him (""La donna e mobile"") was a masterstroke. Laugh-out-loud funny.

5. ""Die tote Stadt"" (5 stars) - Have you ever had a deliciously beautiful dream you didn't want to end? Gorgeous music by Erich Korngold, breath-taking images, two beautiful actors (Elizabeth Hurley nude, vavavoom), no storyline (no need for one) all blended seamlessly by Bruce Beresford to make this fairytale love story aria. <heavy sigh>

6. Les Boreades (2 & 1/2 stars) - A film of disturbing beauty. I was unaware of the fact that European aristocrats found it fun to bring people from an insane asylum to the opera. Robert Altman shot his subject from the stage looking out at the audience and all the antics that ensue. The unfamiliar music from the French Baroque might not be to everyone's liking.

7. ""Tristan und Isolde"" (5 stars) - In my humble opinion, this is the best overall film of the compilation. Music, images and story, Franc Roddam creates the complete package. If you are familiar with composer Richard Wagner and ""Isoldes Liebestod"", the music featured, this film's impact will be especially jarring. (WOW!) I warn everyone of the sexually expicit nature of this short, though it is by no means gratuitous. (Bridget Fonda, in an early role.) There is a sensational cut from the Arizona landscape to the Las Vegas skyline, which is most arresting. And the end! Don't want to give it away. You'll all just have to trust me. This one is worth it. Leontyne Price graces us again with her vocal talents.

8. ""Turandot"" (4 & 1/2 stars) - I got to give Dir. Ken Russell props for taking on only one of the most familiar and beloved tenor arias in all of opera, ""Nessun dorma"" by Giacomo Puccini. The surreal images in the beginning of the models wearing bizarre garb and jewelry will leave you wondering where this film is going, but once the great Jussi Bjoerling starts singing the aria in earnest all will be explained.

9. ""Louise"" (5 stars) - This one is my personal favorite. The late Derek Jarman gives the viewer only the ""impression"" of a story and allows his audience to fill in the blanks to everyone's own taste. Who is the old woman bowing on stage and being showered with flower petals? Are she and the young woman the same person at different times? (Tilda Swinton, in an early role. As an actress, she has taken roles that have downplayed her looks. I didn't realize just how beautiful a young women she was.) The aria ""Depuis le jour"" (the incomparable Leontyne Price doing the honors, once again) sets the mood perfectly and whisks us along until the film ends long before we want it to. <another heavy sigh>

10. ""I Pagliacci"" (2 & 1/2 stars) - As stated above, this film is shown in tiny little snipets thoughout the whole compilation (a ritornello, of sorts, for all of you musicians out there), and its use does create interest. The part when the great character actor John Hurt goes into the church to pray before an icon of the Virgin Mary leads us smoothly and logically to ""La Virgine degli Angeli"" in the second film. As each vignette is presented, it becomes clear (to us opera buffs, at least) that our actor is preparing himself for the role of Canio in Ruggiero Leoncavallo tragic one act opera and its seminal aria ""Vesti la giubba"", heard in an old phonograph recording by Enrico Caruso. So why the 2 & 1/2 stars? The final culmination left me disappointed and unsatisfied. The lead up was better than the finale. (I recommend reading the review ""Opera's Passing Parade"" by Lorenzo for a better explanation of this particular short. Excellent!)

To sum it all up, this DVD was an instant keeper for me. The good films were great. If you are new to opera and want to learn more, you might find it rewarding to make cursory study of each musical piece you find enjoyable. Knowing what I knew already about the music certainly added to my own enjoyment of this DVD. As for the ones I didn't enjoy, I will defer to those other reviewers who might do a better job than I at explaining and defending their worth.",1258156800,27,7289,4.664591439688716

1231130,5,B00000IYR0,"There comes a time when you are exposed to a film...to a song...to a photograph...to a piece of history that sends you to a place where you either want to be...or wish to avoid.

I saved the film ""ARIA"" for Father's Day...because when I began to watch it six months ago I was quickly enveloped in an aura of nostalgia that tugged at my heart.

I don't know how to review such a film as ""ARIA"".  There's never been anything like it, nor will there be again.  It is cinematic brilliance...cinematic brilliance...cinematic brilliance.  Do you get the point?

It is a visual masterpiece...a musical masterpiece...simply a piece of art!

I'd be remiss if I told you it was for everyone.  This one is very much a romantic (sometimes erotic) flick I would highly recommend to the hopeless romantics on this planet.  Unfortunately, that eliminates most of the men on Earth...but not me.

I don't remember the last time I cried so much...so hard...so consistently...than with this operatic, eroti,. connectic, endearing...and sometimes tragic epic.

It is filled with love...with pain...with hope...and joy...and sprinkled with passion...with eternal love...with lost dreams...with hopeful fantasies...with ART!

Many films have left me speechless...this one will never find a way to keep my trap shut.

Maybe it's the romance in me that provoked the tears...but this film is one that goes straight to the heart...the soul...the ears and the tears.  If you've ever been in love...lost a love...yearned for love...or simply enjoyed the thought of being in love...""ARIA"" is for you.

See it with a loving friend.  I swear you'll swap tissues...you'll hug...you'll cry out loud...

and that's what makes this film such an epic of the heart.  What's wrong with tears?  What's wrong with wanting...having...losing...possessing the strength of eternal love and passion?  Isn't that what life is all about?

All of this is captured without a script.  The soul is orchestrated by operatic classics.

It is profound sound...visual candy that only a cinematic artist could capture on film.

This one was made for PR...for me.  It will go down as one of the finest films I have ever seen.

Only one hint...it is a series of vignettes that build in intensity.  The star-studded cast includes many classic actors and actresses...but their challenge in this ditty was to capture your heart without a script.  Guess what?  They do.

Here's the box.  Go out...rent or buy this box...along with some Kleenex...a bottle of Chardonnay...and hold the hand of someone you love.  I, regretably, was home alone...and when I let Stan (my dog) in the house after the film...he never received a better back rub (scratch behind the ears).  I'm still lost in ""ARIA"".  The tranquil mood...the imagery...the beautiful music will live with me forever.  Phew!  This one was simply awesome!",1119139200,26,2848,5.088744588744588
1231131,4,B00000IYR0,"I first saw Aria in the theater back in high school (about 3 million years ago) and only because I wanted to impress a girl way more artistic than myself.
It worked, but not in a way I'd expected.  The movie, a series of vignettes, runs the whole emotional spectrum.  In my younger days, we were blown away by the Wagner/Roddam piece starring a young Fonda, so loving and jarring at the same time.  These days I find all the music beautiful, but one or two of the vignettes boring.  The entire movie is beautifully shot and all deserves to be watched at least once.
After having done that you'll find continual enjoyment watching Sturridge, Beresford, Roddam, Jarman, and Bryden's interpretations.
Who knows, you might fall in love with opera too.",1042761600,12,747,4.679389312977099

7911707,1,B00000IYR0,"As others have pointed out, this edition of ""Aria"" has problems. The visual and audio quality are poor. And the image is not widescreen (despite what it says on the box and online) -- it's badly cropped. For a movie that's all about visual and musical splendor, these are very serious problems indeed. This wonderful if quirky movie deserves far better. Wait for a new version, perhaps someday on Blu-ray?",1445904000,4,405,4.8
