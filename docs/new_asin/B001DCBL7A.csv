8292693,3,B001DCBL7A,My cat loves this dvd. She sits through almost all of it. It is nice to see the large birds and chickens and rabbits etc. great sounds as well. The only thing I did not like is the inappropriate people part. They did not have to add the people or long length of cats playing. Otherwise I would have rated it a 5 if they left out the people and put a short time of other cats playing.,1514764800,,383,3.923076923076923
8292694,4,B001DCBL7A,"This was gifted to me. I remember something called ""Video Catnip"" in the 90s back then on vhs, now this is awesome! Even when I'm doing something simple like running errands nearby and don't know how long I will be gone, I will pop this in the dvr. My two furbabies get a kick out of it; and it keeps them from ganging up on each other when they get bored:) It's pretty long and there's quite a lot of critters here...I sneak a peek at it just to see for myself. Lot of cute sound effects, and even some adorable feline furbabies doing cute cat things like batting and scratching. Fish swimming, ferrets, chickens, roosters, what more can I say. ""Buddy"" sits on my chair looking content, and sometimes tries to get on the tv shelf to get a ""closer look"". My other cat does not go outside and this gives her a little glimpse of the ""outside"" world which is good for her. Lots of fun!",1424131200,,882,4.255952380952381
8292695,5,B001DCBL7A,"Oh my! What fun this video has been. I have 3 cats, and only one watches the video,  but he sure enjoys it! He jumps up onto the TV stand everytime we come into the room, and he starts looking at the screen. If he watches it several days in a row, he kind of looses interest, but we take a break from it, and in a little while he's mesmerized by it again.",1418860800,,355,3.7972972972972974
8292696,5,B001DCBL7A,"Got this DVD for my sisters cat sassy, and she loved it",1408752000,,55,3.6666666666666665
8292697,2,B001DCBL7A,My cat's had no interested in the DVD though they watch YouTube bird videos. This was a fail. I wouldn't recommend it.,1371859200,,118,4.409090909090909
8292698,5,B001DCBL7A,"The cats LOVE It! And that's all that matters! They watch it pretty much 24/7 and since we have 15 of them, there's usually one or two watching it at any given time.",1367798400,2,165,4.03030303030303
8292699,4,B001DCBL7A,This was purchased for my daughter who has a a great love for each of her cats and respect for their personalities.  She was very pleased with it.  I probably should have given it 5 stars because my cat enjoyed it too.  We watched it so much it got repetitive.,1366156800,2,260,4.16
8292700,5,B001DCBL7A,"I have two cats and they both come running when they hear this DVD starting up. They bat at the screen trying to catch the birds, squirrels, bunnies, etc. I like the way it replays continuously until you turn it off. I went away for a weekend and came back and it was still playing. It seems like it kept my cats from being lonely or anxious while I was gone. My only complaint is that weird sound effects have been added. The kitties don't seem to mind though.",1353888000,4,461,4.191011235955056
8292701,5,B001DCBL7A,"Our cat is spoiled...and likes a lot of attention.  We were given this DVD by a friend, and could not believe how much Scraggs loved it!  She actually made a ""perch"" for herself on the TV stand so she could get ""up close and personal"" with all the animals.  The sounds are wonderful, and it's full of action of different animals/birds/fish/insects.  The perfect companion when we're gone...or even when we are watching something on TV that WE want to watch...she gets her feelings hurt when we don't turn it on for her!  Great gift, too...",1316995200,6,539,4.631578947368421
