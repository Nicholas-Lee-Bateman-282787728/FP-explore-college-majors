8362389,4,B001BXNA8Y,"This show caught my attention when, by chance, during a night when I struggled to sleep, I turned on my TV and changed the channel to A&E.  I couldn't fall asleep during the show, but found myself grabbing a pen and pencil instead, to write down the show's information.  I knew I wanted to purchase the DVD.

The DVD itself is pretty straightforward.  I gave it 4 stars because there really isn't any special feature (not that I expected much).  But the ""bio"" episode itself is worth the money (so long as it stays under $30).

The narration never burdens the compilation of photos and music.  Nor does the narration get too comical or cartoonish, as can happen sometimes with documentaries (particularly those about mysterious or dark characters like Poe or van Gough).

What makes this episode so compelling is that it doesn't just focus on van Gough and the dark chapters of his life.  It presents almost a rival in that department with Paul Gaughin and his own demons.  And when you have two guys like that forced to share a house/workspace--as well as their vices, like the local brothel--it creates must-watch, must-learn-more-about drama.  And the best part was, it really happened.

And, coincidentally enough, just a few weeks after I ordered this DVD, a major news release revealed that some historians believe Gaughin was who actually, famously lobbed off van Gough's ear (with a sword!) during a confrontation.  That confrontation is presented in this video, but it tells the story believed to have been true up until spring 2009 (that van Gough cut it off himself AFTER a confrontation with Gaughin).

Bear in mind, this video is not just about the issues between the two men; both their personal lives, both before and after each other, are presented here.  (And they are equally fascinating.)

Side note: The music stands out, as well.  Not in a bad way, but just by how well it complements the story and visuals.

Overall, this is an engaging video that feels almost like a feature-length film--rather than a trip through history with just photos, paintings, music, and narrated words.  I recommend its purchase, both for the production value as well as just the darn good story it presents.",1244332800,,2207,4.8373333333333335
