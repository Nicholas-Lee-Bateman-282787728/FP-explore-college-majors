8194045,5,B000Q1HWMC,"I bought this DVD used for less than $2.00 and it was a great deal.  The DVD is short, 40 minutes, but also very informative. It discussed the history of submarines. Submarines in WWI and WWII, the Cold War, and beyond.  The DVD is packaged in a book binding with 24 pages of facts and photos. The book also includes a quiz at the end to see if you learned anything.  This would make a great addition to your Submarine DVD library or as a gift to the submarine fan in your life.",1258329600,2,478,4.118279569892473
