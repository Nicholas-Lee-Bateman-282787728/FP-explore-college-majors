8642225,5,B00IIC9P30,"I was so very fortunate to be a one of 6 students studying with Dr Silvana Montanaro for a year in Rome.  It was a year I will always remember with deep gratitude.  Dr Montanaro's voice continues to guide me, as does the voice of producer Susan Stephenson (The Universal Child and Child of the World)

Yes!, thank you Silvana many times over for your work, your wisdom, your patience, your grace, your humor and for inspiring me to think deeply, feel genuinely and to work for infants and families with all my heart.  Thanks go also to the late Karin Salzmann for creating this  tribute; I never had the chance to meet her, but I wish I had.

This short tribute to Dr Montanaro is a treasure for me as one of her students; it will be a good addition to the library of anyone who serves to inspire parents, grandparents, and others interested in the amazing abilities of the youngest among us.
Grazie Silvana!",1394150400,4,908,4.4397590361445785
