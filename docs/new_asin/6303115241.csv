7838940,4,6303115241,"Plot:  Upon discovering a Federation shuttle craft floating about helplessly in space, the Enterprise brings it in for investigation.  Riker and Worf look at the shuttle and it's identity is, ""NCC 1701 USS Enterprise Shuttlecraft 05"".  Interestingly (and a little disconcertingly), the same exact shuttle is also in the bay, in perfect shape.  Well, as if things couldn't get anymore freaky, inside the shuttle is...Captain Picard.  It appears the shuttle is from the future (approx. 6 hours ahead) with our dear captain inside of it.  Well, when they play a recording from the shuttle, it shows the Enterpise being destroyed in some sort of space tornado...six hours from now.  Meanwhile, the future Picard has been placed in sick bay.  He's unable to communicate, his physical signs are all out of normalcy, and Consuler Troi indicates that he's terrified (due to the time distortion thing).  6 hours later, the Enterprise is caught is space vortex, and now they must find out what actually happened before it's too late.

A pretty good episode.  Everyone remains loyal to the captain despite from what the shuttle recording seems to indicate.  Dr. Pulaski, interestingly, is a bit of a worry-wart in this episode.  She's not sure if Picard can handle the stress of the situation (as if this isn't anything new to her) and is worried that he won't be fit to command.  Fortunately, Counselor Troi stands up for the captain, saying that he's handling it quite well (and since she can sense his emotions, I think we can give her and the captain the benefit of the doubt).

While I do like ""Cause and Effect"" better, this is nevertheless, quite a good episode.

Get's a solid 4 pushing 5 stars.",1158364800,,1692,4.863636363636363
7838941,4,6303115241,"This episode was one of the first TNG episodes that delt with time travel. And it was pulled off really well. The plot is the Enterprise picking up a Federation shuttlecraft. When they discover that the shuttlecraft is an identical match to a shuttlecraft that is already in the shuttlebay, they discover an somewhat identical Captain Picard. The reason was that the Enterprise had attacked by a vortex that was also attacking Picard himself. Which led him to the conclusion that the vortex would leave the Enterprise alone, if he left the ship. It turned out that the Enterprise would be destroyed and the shuttlecraft with the past captain then was hit with an amazing force and sent hurdling through time. The kicker is that the event occurs six hours after the present Enterprise discovers him. Will the Enterprise meet up with this vortex ""again""? Another splended performance by Patrick Stewart playing a dual of himself ala Brent Spiner. We also learn that Riker loves to cook. On of my favorite second season episodes.",1106611200,,1026,4.902298850574713
7838942,5,6303115241,"Meeting Yourself
Picard meets his future self six hours into the future.  Originally planned as a Q episode, the Enterprise is engulfed by a vortex that takes the crew into an unknown dimension.  Another version of Picard comes aboard the Enterprise to warn the Picard from the present.  Of what purpose, it's never revealed.  We don't find out much about the one from the future.  The best scene is when Riker discovers future Picard in the shuttle.  You don't know weather or not the second Picard will avert the coming disaster or cause it.  Picard has a line that best describes the story.  ""If you travel far enough you will meet yourself.""  This one was what was called a ""bottle show.""  All of the scenes take place aboard the Enterprise and no other location shooting was required.",994896000,,789,4.693430656934306
7838943,4,6303115241,"""Time Squared"" is the initial foray into time travel for the Next Generation crew.  The Enterprise finds one of its shuttles drifting in space with an unconscious Picard on board.  This is rather confusing since Picard is sitting on the bridge at the time.  When they examine the shuttle's logs they discover it is from six hours in the future when the Enterprise was surrounded by an energy vortex.  The Picard from the future is barely able to communicate anything since he is caught up in the painful throws of a time paradox.  The shuttle left the Enterprise right before the starship was destroyed and apparently there is nothing they can do about the situation (going off in a completely different direction from what was indicated in the logs would be a start).  To no one's surprise, six hours later the energy vortex appears.  Troi tells Picard the entity is focusing on him as the ship's captain.  Understanding now why he left the ship on the shuttle, Picard knows this is the one thing he cannot do if he wants to save his ship and crew.
Time paradoxes are always fun logic loops (what happens if you accidentally go back in time and kill your grandfather is one of the classics, the other being that if you go back in time to stop the Titanic from hitting the iceberg you will be the one that causes the accident because you already went back in time to have caused the accident you went back in time to prevent--but I digress) and ""Time Squared"" offers a simple but compelling mystery.  The theoretical ramifications of it all get rather lost in the necessity of solving the mystery and avoiding the destruction of the Enterprise, but the key thing in this particular episode is the growing sense of unease.  After all, there are two Picards and visual proof that the Enterprise is about to be destroyed.  Like ""Contagion"" (Episode 37), this episode presents the crew dealing solving problems and really helps develop the idea of them as a team.  Well into the second season the roles of each character are becoming well defined, which, in turn, makes it easier to write for the series, thereby setting the stage for some really good episodes in the near future.",972086400,3,2176,4.652741514360313
