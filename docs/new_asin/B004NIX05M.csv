Spending 600 days in Ranthambhore National Park, Colin Stafford-Johnson and Salim Ali followed and filmed a tigress named Machli and her cubs Broken Tail and Slant Ear.  Colin describes Broken Tail as ""always the ringleader"" and as an energetic and bold tiger cub, who chased them in their car.  After learning that Broken Tail died from being hit by a train 150 miles from Ranthambhore, Colin and Salim decide to reconstruct and follow his presumed path through various landscapes to the place of his death at Darra, which, as a result of his death, is now designated as a National Park; along the way, they talk to local residents, some of whom say they briefly saw a tiger.  Colin considers why Broken Tail left Ranthambhore; based on his daring personality, Broken Tail was probably following a normal dispersal experience for a young male tiger -- I remember reading about a young male tiger who roamed to an unknown area and made a kill, and the resident male tiger later followed the blood trail from the kill to the young tiger, whom he attacked and nearly killed, showing the great danger that young male big cats face when they move into an unfamiliar area.  The documentary features scenes of Broken Tail affectionately nuzzling against his mother Machli, strongly playing with his brother Slant Ear, stalking in harmony with Slant Ear, and jerking back from the snapping jaws of a crocodile.  I appreciated the scenes of the tigers relaxing in the majestic ruins of Ranthambhore and of the monkeys jumping energetically and fluidly.  The last tiger family reunion scene at the end of the documentary shows Machli laying down on a sand trail and affectionately reaching her paw up to touch her approaching now-large sons Broken Tail and Slant Ear, who sit down to reverentially suckle from her, even though they clearly didn't need her milk.  In reaching Darra, Colin reflects that although Broken Tail heard the sounds of train horns growing up in Ranthambhore, the young tiger didn't understand the danger from a train.

8436656,5,B004NIX05M,"Broken Tail is a story about a tiger that will melt your heart. I saw it on PBS television awhile back.
 Since that first viewing, I knew I had to own a copy for my video collection.
 I am an avid animal lover, especially tigers. Thier regal majestry, strength and awesome beauty is unlike anything in the animal kingdom.
 The ending is quite sad and as many times as I have seen it, I still struggle with chokeing up. A tear always falls.
 If you have a passion for tigers, as I do, then you will love this beautiful story about a tiger with a ""broken tail.""
