8145636,5,B000II05GS,"Excellent French film, great actors. Pierre Richard is one of my favorites. The movie is funny and a little naive (as all older movies are), but excellent entertainment for the whole family. May not be quite appropriate for younger kids, as there are some weapons and drug hints, as well as scenes of night life. I'd rate it as PG13. It was one of my favorite movies when I was in my teens.

Francois Perrin (Pierre Richard) is a very sweet, shy and extremely unlucky person who works as an accountant. The president of the company where he is employed has a daughter who also has unusually bad luck. When she disappears during her vacation in Mexico, the distraught father sends Perrin to accompany a private detective Campana (Gerard Depardieu) in search of her, hoping that a person as unlucky as she is will be able to retrace her steps and find her! The hilarious adventures of the two will make you want to watch this movie again!",1245715200,,936,4.571428571428571
