8535952,5,B0094JELLW,"This is one of those concert nights that you wish you could have been in the live audience, it's so electrifying and alive...yet you're thrilled to own a DVD of the event to watch over and over! I kid you not, this is Larnelle Harris at his best. He delivers high notes with his signature style, and quite simply preaches the gospel right there through his words and music. He's so empassioned in these songs...and there are many classics! Yet perhaps one of the greatest moments of the evening is ""The Greatest of These""--powerful and passionate. Another special song is the trio ""The Kings of the Earth"" that only a few die-hard fans will remember from an oratorio-like project by Greg Nelson & Bob Farrell called ""SAVIOUR: The Story of God's Passion for His People"". I was so excited to see this because it is my favorite piece from that recording.

Now I of course have to mention that my favorite singer of all time, Sandi Patty, makes a marvelous appearance on the concert as well, joining Larnelle for their signature duet, ""I've Just Seen Jesus."" They also premier a new duet called ""Then Came The Morning""--yet I have to mention that this song is not a live performance at the concert. It's a music video of sorts of the two of them singing the song in the recording studio...a cool feature, but I still prefer live.

Let me just say again that this is a truly special evening of music and sincere worship to an almighty God. Every song is so powerful. These are some of the best artists around, and their music continues to be alive and timeless.",1383091200,2,1556,4.553571428571429
8535953,5,B0094JELLW,"In the land known for country music, the stellar performance of Mr. Larnelle Harris is  well received in this great gospel 'CD/DVD' collection. ( i.e. Each item is to be sold separately.)
  His finesse in showmanship lets one reminiscence on the decades of hits he had in Contemporary Christian music.
  With his smooth execution on song medleys -like PRAISE medley and FOREVER TRUE medley-Mr. Harris also duets his signature songs with the excellency of SANDI PATTY ( I'VE JUST SEEN JESUS ) , STEVE GREEN and STEVE AMERSON ( KING OF THE EARTH ).
  Timed just right for the EASTER season, The LARNELLE: LIVE IN NASHVILLE 'bundle' ( i.e. Whether CD, DVD or BOTH ) would make a great EASTER gift for his fans ,for fans of the BILLY GRAHAM CRUSADE music , or for mellow-MUSIC-listeners who enjoy hearing and relaxing to concert music on the FRONT-ROW-SEATS.",1364169600,3,854,4.7687074829931975
