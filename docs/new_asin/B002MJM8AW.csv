3952302,5,B002MJM8AW,"Too funny.  How else do you describe comedy of this caliber?  With a keen grasp of rural and urban societies, John Reep proceeds to stomp the grapes of society to produce a uniquely humorous view of life in his world.  From the invention of the house boat, which is basically a redneck caulking a double wide mobile home, to the strange people one encounters and the County Fair, the laughs just keep erupting.  I saw his act on cable and went online right away to get this comedy masterpiece.  What a brilliant execution of 2 cultures blended together like cake and ice cream.  This is a comedy performance I highly recommend cause it's just so much fun.",1330041600,,655,4.555555555555555

3952310,5,B002MJM8AW,"I've watched Jon Reep win the Last Comic Standing show and have thoroughly enjoyed his comedy live in Winston-Salem NC on multiple occasions. One of the funniest most entertaining comedians today, his shows are a must see if you like comedy. In my humble opinion I think the ability to create spontaneous comedy on the spot in any setting or situation that occurs separates the good from the great and Jon has that great natural funny gift that will have you laughing again and again. Not only is the material hilarious but he adds an enjoyable presentation delivering his jokes, stories and live performances that his a notch above most comedians I've seen. He is a true talent who doesn't rely on excessive cussing to have your jaw sore from continuous laughing, he is a joy to watch.",1419638400,,786,4.702898550724638
