I'm sure the Carver had his personal safety in mind - along with trying to let the camera see his moves. Chainsaw Carvers must have the saw tucked in close to maintain control of the saw.
You can't hold the saw away from you ""To let the world see what your doing"".
I'll give the man a Pat On The Back!",1058745600,,520,3.779816513761468
8484879,5,B00004YMGS,"Perhaps it's just me but I found it to be a good video. If it were a hand carving of some sort I may have expected different but with the buzz saw, I pretty much got the idea of how to handle the tools without cutting off limbs. I wouldn't and didn't expect the producers to recommend any brand name of tools. Chain sawz a chain saw.",1009843200,5,333,3.985074626865672
