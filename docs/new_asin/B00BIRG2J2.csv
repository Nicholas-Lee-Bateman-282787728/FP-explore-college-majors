8569129,4,B00BIRG2J2,"In this film festival favorite, set in the 1980's, Marc's mother decides to surprise him on his 18th birthday with a new bed for his room.  In moving the old bed, she finds his cache of gay magazines ... uh, oh!

This is a well-produced, entertaining film, with capable actors, including newcomer Josh Hahn as Marc, and Susan Brittan in a scene-stealing role as his mother.  It is based loosely on the personal experience of writer/director Jay J. Levy.  Only 40 minutes long, it has been featured at many gay film festivals since its release in 2008, and won several awards.  DVD has over 20 minutes of extras, consisting of interviews with the mostly gay cast and crew.  I give the film four stars out of five.",1375920000,,712,4.566929133858268

We laughed our way through the movie, felt for the characters and cheered the confirming ending. No wonder this was so popular with audiences at so many festivals!",1371340800,,293,4.653846153846154
