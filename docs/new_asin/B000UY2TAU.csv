8215580,3,B000UY2TAU,"I purchased the videos directly from them. The videos are ok, but there are some issues. Where they filmed it, the grass keeps you from seeing well foot placement, ground must be slightly uneven in some places as his balance seems to suffer, the sound effects are completely unnecessary. The window in window works well for showing what he is doing when his back is to the camera.",1501372800,,380,4.602941176470588
8215581,4,B000UY2TAU,Arrived ahead of schedule.  Super training program.  Would recommend to all.,1404777600,,76,5.818181818181818
8215582,5,B000UY2TAU,"I am a huge fan of Sanaz Shahbazi (Member of the US National Tae Kwon Do team) and recently bought this DVD as I prepare to watch and analyze the upcoming matches for the London Olympics. She had endorsed it on her own website so I trusted it was a good instructional video and I was not disappointed. Master Mak delivers great instruction and makes it easy for a beginner like me to understand and develop basic to advanced Tae Kwon Do skills. I can now watch the matches in the olympics with a more trained eye, and further enhance my skills by watching this great instructional video. Highly recommend for Tae Kwon Do Poomse!!!",1343260800,,630,4.48695652173913
8215583,5,B000UY2TAU,"I met Master Mak on a flight back from Tulsa and we started talking. I actually had just had happened to unfortunately been in an incident earlier that week where I had been beat up and unable to defend myself and he noticed. He started to talk about how he is a taekwondo instructor and about the art of taekwondo, convincing me to at least look into a lesson or two. When I got back for the heck of it I bought his video. I was amazed at how intuitive it was and easy to learn without actually being in a dojo. A great video and I really suggest it for anyone trying to pick up the sport or, like me, are looking for some lessons in self defense!",1343260800,3,648,4.0310077519379846
8215584,5,B000UY2TAU,I am new to Poomse and found this DVD through a search. This is a great video for beginners as well as the more skilled martial artist. I love the sound effects because they make watching the video more fun. I would recommend this to a friend.,1343260800,,243,4.191489361702128
8215585,5,B000UY2TAU,I'm a 4th Dan instructor and love having all the forms on one dvd. All the Palgwes and Taegeuks are accurate. My students have greatly improved from this DVD and find it very professional. I personally love the sound effects :),1331424000,,227,4.560975609756097
8215586,1,B000UY2TAU,"This DVD has so many flaws I don't know where to begin.
1. Master Mak filmed ALL the Poomse's on a playing field in grass high enough to cover his ankles (so you cant see what his feet are doing) and you even see cars driving by in the background sometimes.
2. There are artificial sound effects for EACH kick and punch (they sound
like they came from an arcade game).
3. The camera is not steady as the person filming it sometimes jerks it up and down.
4. Master Mak sometimes slighly ""stumbles"" while performing techniques (maybe its because he's doing the Poomse in the grass, who knows).
5. I could go on and on, but why bother?

Dont waste your money on this DVD.",1197590400,9,668,4.301587301587301
