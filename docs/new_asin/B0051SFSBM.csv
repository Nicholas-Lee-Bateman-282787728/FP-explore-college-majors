4525959,5,B0051SFSBM,"This review is for the blu-ray transfer--the picture quality, sound quality, etc.--not for how good the story or acting is, or not. ""Presumed Innocent"" has a beautiful picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's very sharp. And this is a 1990 film. The audio is excellent as well. I'm very pleased with this purchase, which is an upgrade to the DVD I already owned.

(By the way, in contrast, the ""Presumed Innocent"" DVD really stinks on my HD TV, it's of the worst DVDs I've seen on my 55"" HD TV (it's VERY soft-focus there); most other DVDs look better on an HD TV than does this DVD. But, THIS BLU-RAY looks fantastic-- a MAJOR upgrade to the DVD.)

There are no extras with this blu-ray, but, yes, it does have a menu!

By the way, another reviewer wrote that he had bought this blu-ray double-feature, and that the ""Frantic"" film had French audio on this American version, which was corrected to English on a later edition.  He also furnished the bar code numbers of the old and new products.  Neither matched mine, and mine has the correct American (English) audio.  The bar code on mine is 8 83929 10637 0.  The ISBN # on mine is 1-4198-9295-9.

GREAT job on this film's transfer via excellent Blu Ray remastering. One of the best blu-rays, technically, for a 1990 film.

""Frantic,"" while appearing slightly less sharp than ""Presumed Innocent,"" is really an excellent blu-ray transfer, too. Its colors are accurate and vivid, too. It's just that the picture looks a hair soft; still excellent, but with a soft layer of grain and thus not as crystal-clear as ""Presumed Innocent."" Possibly this is in the film's master . . . Still quite enjoyable to view, and the best picture we've seen for this film. Also recommended!",1378512000,8,1779,4.65814696485623
4525960,5,B0051SFSBM,"Frantic is a great Hichcockian thriller starring Harrison Ford and is FINALLY available in widescreen and in hi def.
Previously on DVD it was limited to Pan Scan so when I found out it was available both on Blu-ray and in widescreen format
I ordered it immediately. I think Presumed Innocent is one of Ford's worst films. Very very boring, beautiful but boring.
This set is worth getting for Frantic alone, one of Roman Polanski's best films.",1377648000,,442,4.753246753246753
4525961,5,B0051SFSBM,"While Roman Polanski was avoiding authorities in America in 1988, he managed to put together a superb suspense thriller. It stars Harrison Ford in a rather unique role; that of a doctor, an every man type such as Jimmy Stewart in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" without the Indiana Jones hype. Although filmed 25 years ago, it seems more contemporary that ever. A fine thriller that even Hitch would approve!

What is NOT contemporary is the fact that we consumers here in Region 1 - North America get nothing but JUNK & GARBAGE from the releasing studios. Lousy, grainy transfers in the edited Pan & Scan format; not fit for viewing.

Alas, Blu-ray brings us ""Frantic"" in its OAR along with ""Presumed Innocent"", an equally suspense thriller.  A fine duo to sit along side your Hitchcock collection!",1372377600,,795,4.746376811594203
4525962,3,B0051SFSBM,"Bought it for Frantic as I like Polanski's movies.
The movie is ok but flawed (the end feels off) and did not age very well.
The image quality is not good.",1368835200,,155,4.032258064516129
4525963,5,B0051SFSBM,"I was thrilled when these two finally came out in Blu-Ray, Especially ""Frantic"" because the original did not have subtitles. This is one great two-fer !",1350864000,,152,4.884615384615385
4525964,4,B0051SFSBM,"This episode has caused me one hell of a headache:

1. I also had the faulty audio version as part of an order late last year 2010.

2. I only found the problem recently and on checking the feedback here, realized that I was not alone.

3. I contacted Customer Service by email and they agreed to replace the item at no cost to me. I carefully explained that there was a new version of the Blu-ray which I of course wanted as my disc was not just 'one-off' defective.

4. A new order was created, but on checking my account found that the new order was infact for the same faulty version.

5. Once again I contacted Customer Service, this time by the ""CHAT"" method. After about one hour of discussion, I think I have a resolution, but to get there was an epic and I'm still not convinced that the message has gotten through that there are two versions of this Blu-ray in their system, one of which is a re-issue by the manufacturer of the previous defective one.

6. The simplest solution to this, was to cancel the new replacement order of the faulty title and for me to manually re-order the newer version. For some reason, they were not able to simply swap in this order to the re-issue!
I've been assured that I'm still going to get refunded for the original order.

7. Assuming that my replacement is okay in all respects, I've still only given this Blu-ray 4 Stars as I don't think the VIDEO
on both the contained movies is as good as many of the titles that are being re-issued.
It's certainly not bad, but nothing like the apparent original resolution that is being realized these days. Infact I maybe going out on a bit of a limb here, but video wise, this Blu-ray release is no better than what would be available on a standard DVD. The advantage though I suppose, is getting the two movies on one disc.

8. Why the original, which has obviously been acknowledged by the manufacturer as defective is still in the system, escapes me.",1310947200,,1942,4.389972144846797
4525965,5,B0051SFSBM,"Unfortunately Amazon has just combined the reviews for the old and new Blu-Rays of FRANTIC, confusing things even more.

The one for sale here as ""Frantic & Presumed Innocent"", with a released date of May 31, 2011, released a year after the original, is a corrected version. The first disc accidentally replaced the English audio track with the French audio track. For more details on the differences, see my review on the page for the original disc.

After I was unsuccessful in getting Warner Home Video to fix the mistake, I contacted Roman Polanski's office in Paris. They got involved, and within two months a new Blu-Ray was issued.

Note that if you see this new version in stores, it will have the same packaging. The difference is a sticker placed over the barcode.

THIS IS WHAT TO LOOK FOR to distinguish it from the old defective one:

The old number under the barcode is:

8 83929 10637 0

The NEW number under the NEW barcode is:

4525970,4,B0051SFSBM,"I noticed that a lot of people like Frantic, I thought it was a pretty weak thriller because the main character, played by Harrison Ford, puts way too much trust in this pretty young woman who happens to be a criminal. But, Presumed Innocent is a good movie. Director Pakula does a masterful job of bringing Scott Turow's best selling court room thriller to the big screen. This is also one of Harrison Ford's best acting performances. Watch the way Pakula uses lighting, the camera, close ups, to heighten the drama and tension. Unfortunately the Blu Ray transfer on Frantic is poor. The image quality of Presumed Innocent is better. Neither film has good sound by today's standards. But if you like court room thrillers, Presumed Innocent is one of the best, and the book is very good, too.",1391472000,,792,4.705035971223022
4525971,1,B0051SFSBM,These are very good movies. Warner Bros. should be ashamed for putting out the quality of video on this disc. The movies are so grainy that they should be considered poor video quality for DVD. My rating has all to do with the video quality and the product Warner Bros has mis-represented as  blu-ray video quality. Video quality should be a characteristic that Amazon includes in the disc description.,1389139200,2,402,4.826086956521739
4525972,4,B0051SFSBM,"They are both good but, I really like Presumed Innocent.  The cast is great and you will never find a better price on two titles like this.  Harrison Ford is a non actor/actor.  Presumed Innocent is made for him.  There is a real super star cast and you will not be at all disappointed.  Great purchase",1383177600,,302,4.321428571428571
4525973,4,B0051SFSBM,"First of all I like to say, that I find it ""ridiculous"" that I wasn't able to find ""Presumed Innocent"" on its own to purchase anywhere!. They push this double feature every where u turn around, so I finally gave up and got it. Pricing wasn't bad, after all and I like Harrison Ford. However, I don't much care for director Roman Polanski whom directed Frantic which is half the package. I tried watching ""Frantic"" not long ago, on its own, and I wasn't please with this picture, even with Harrison Ford, but I thought  maybe I give another try and change my mind, ""NOT""!.  It is probably due to the way Mr. Polanski likes to do his projects. Anyway, so I cave in, and got it because I do like very much Presumed Innocent. Good plot, acting and a surprising ending that will definitely surprise you if you have never seen this feature. Of course, this kind of film, has been done before or after, with similar plot but I believe out of all those this one is probably the best one of them to which I strongly recommend. Now, in regards to Frantic, I gave it another shot and watched it in its entirety although I have to admit, they were times, where I wanted to stop watching, but due to the fact that I spent the money on it, I am one of those persons that "" like"" to give everything that one chance to change my mind at some point thru the film, but that never came. Yes, I know there are those of you out there that believe Mr. Polanski is one of the greatest directors out there, but I am not one of them. the whole film was shot in Europe and the plot was just not my cup of tea. So I am leaving this one, up to you to make up your mind and decide but do not expect the Harrison ford you are used to seeing in other films, and I am not talking about Indiana Jones or any of them, I'm speaking about other films, he's made, none action related (although there is nothing wrong with those!!) where he is great at it and it is still hard to believe he has yet to win an academy award for any of his work. so for my taste, Frantic gets two stars, just because of Harrison ford in it, to where as I'm watching the movie, even he looks  confused. Presumed innocent gets four. By the way, when you get this package deal, you get both in ONE Disk, so is like even after you get it, you can't even get rid of the FRANTIC disk, if you wanted which I find NOT very tasteful, the way they try push both these films ""down your throat"" even if you only want one!.",1381708800,,2453,4.095634095634096

4525975,4,B0051SFSBM,"This double-feature is a nice showcase of two Harrison Ford mystery thrillers made within a couple years of each other. The first, ""Presumed Innocent,"" is a story about a prosecutor accused of murdering a former lover. It's decently well paced and while one may suspect the ending, it should still hold substantial doubts and remain ambiguous until the very end. The second, a surprisingly lesser-known Roman Polanski film, is quite reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers. With Neo-noir characteristics in a Hitchcock structure, it plays great homage to his thrillers with its own storyline (not a remake). It's not a ""Chinatown"" with as big a name as Nicholson, but Harrison was already an A-list well recognized from his Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Blade Runner roles. After viewing it I'm surprised it's not a better known film, it's that good. Don't expect ""extras,"" just the two films.

The Blu-ray transfers must be discussed individually. Some cleanup was done, but not extensive restoration work. The prints from both were clean and in good condition (or at least any obvious flaws were fixed). The Presumed Innocent is quite excellent with good, sharp detail and nice audio, given the era of the filming and cinema audio recording technology (including what theaters generally had installed). Frantic won't seem as good a transfer, in picture or audio. It's not the transfer, but the source, which is softer with coarser grain compared to the film stock used for Presumed Innocent. Thus, Frantic doesn't have the ""sharpness"" or contrast level, but does reflect what you were likely to see if screened in a cinema theater. Audio quality is very much driven by the original audio track. It's quite clean without hiss or pops, but not high fidelity, limited by the source and the audio recording technology Polanski employed when the film was produced.

Make some popcorn, have a seat in your comfortable sofa or chair and enjoy a fine Harrison Ford double-feature.",1379548800,,1977,5.098765432098766

8453210,3,B0051SFSBM,"Warner bros has finally Decided to release Roman Palanski's classic FRANTIC on blu-ray
as Double feature with Presumed Innocent
the original DVD version was only 1:33:1 Full screen with very average Digital remaster & no extras not even the Theatrical trailer
well tragically this new blu-ray reissue is no better
the only effort WB did was widen the ratio to 1:85:1 & boost the sound quality to 2.0 master audio stereo mix
the so called new 1080p transfer is average picture quality Warners only slightly cleaned up the picture
so it's slightly better than the old dvd version but there's still some Grain & Dirt in the transfer
pretty Lazy effort by Warners i must say
EXTRAS there are none not even the original trailer, again very Disgusting effort by warners
if anything the only Highlight of this new blu-ray is the ratio is 1:85:1 widescreen & the sound quality has been boosted
this Classic Deserves more respect, it Deserves a new interview with Roman & Harrison
the old dvd is worth 1 star, i gave 2-3 stars for this blu-ray reissue meaning it's tolerable because of the new 1:85:1 ratio",1477353600,,1097,4.7486910994764395
