7809380,5,6301046404,"If you are a fan of theatre, Glenda Jackson or Eugene O'Neill you cannot go wrong with this film. I first saw it on PBS and couldn't believe the quality of acting and command of the challenging play. Every performance is right on the money and Edward Petheridge is superlative, bringing a whole new interpretation of ""Dear old Charlie."" But the play is still Glenda Jackson's triumph. She goes from a heartsick girl to a towering virago of a smothering mother without seemingly blinking.

This is a filming of a theatrical miracle!",1185667200,9,531,4.771739130434782
