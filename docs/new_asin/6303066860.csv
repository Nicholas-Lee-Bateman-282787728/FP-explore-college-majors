7837778,3,6303066860,"The second two OVAs are released in the U.S., this time both are based off manga stories, from volumes 23 and 25.  In the first one, which is mostly original for the first half, Akane is of course trying to cook again, and of course, we all know how her end results are turning out.  If she's not focusing too hard on whatever she's making to follow the instructions carefully, she decides to ""liven up,"" the recipie.  When Ranma's mother arrives, maybe just maybe, her help will cause Akane to finally get over her condition.  Yeah, and maybe Ryoga will come out and reveal himself to Akane as P-Chan.  I didn't really care for the second episode at all, though.  Maybe it's because I really don't care for Hinako, but I thought that the second episode was boring.  I personally rewind the tape after the first episode.  I think Ryoga, Kuno, and Gosunkugi(who appeared in a scene cut-and-pasted from a completely different story) didn't really serve any purpose in the episode, and I noticed that Ukyo and Shampoo were absent.  Personally, I'd say get the DVD set instead, so you can have the first episode but avoid this second one.",1068076800,,1134,4.63

7837780,5,6303066860,Ranma's mother comes to visit in the first episode and tries to teach Akane how to cook.(Talk about your miricle workers) What starts off as a cooking lesson turns into a deepfried cat fight between Ranma and Akane. In  the second episode Ranma gets singled out as perverted disciplinary problem  number 1 by a new teacher with mysterious ties to Happosai. This is  definetly the funniest episode on the tape.,949795200,,409,4.814285714285714
7837781,5,6303066860,"I love these series.  I'm a big Anime fan and is very critical when it comes down to the quality of the animation and storyline.  The ranma 1/2 series is a must to see. It's absolutely hilarous! Normally I hate dubbed  Anime because the translation doesn't do the video justice, but in this  case...because of the story, the humor and the strange misfit of  characters, I really didn't mind the dubbing (this is the only exception  I've seen).  I highly recommend these series.  I've seen them all!",911433600,,498,4.64367816091954
