4384843,1,B004I9SJFC,"If you already have the box set titled, ATREVETE A SONAR, then don't buy this box set. The episodes are exactly the same as the other box set. The only difference is a different cover on the outside of the box set. So, for me this was a waist of money and a big rip of, because I already have the other box set. I do realize this is no fault of Amazon.",1403827200,5,352,3.835616438356164
4384844,5,B004I9SJFC,"I suppose you could watch all 14 combined hours of this show in 1 go because it goes at such a pace that you don't really know where to stop.
The show is excellent especially for those outside Mexico who didn't get to see it, I don't usually watch tele-novela's and understand them fully but being subtitled made it much easier to watch.
If you see the things they left in, the stuff they took out would make things more complicated, it is very fast going and before 1 twist is followed another 1 happens and until the last hour they keep you waiting with more questions to keep you gripped, I am from the UK and foreign language shows have just taken off but I definitely reccomend this to everyone.",1397347200,,700,4.351145038167939

4384846,4,B004I9SJFC,"Atrvete a sonar (Dare to Dream - 817 minutes)

Our bespectacled little virgin with crocheted flowers in her hair and braces on her teeth, always dreamt that the handsome, kind doctor who manages the therapy for her broken arm would be her father. Her dithering blabbermouth mother, who has kept her secret for 14 years, isn't about to start telling her anything now!

This is sort of an American Idol-type plot. The illegitimate teenager has a scholarship to a music camp. Her nemesis is the Mexican version of a Valley Girl, complete with ""Oh! My! God!"" (in Spanish) interspersed through-out. They have ""sing-offs"" all the way through; our little gal has to deal with stage fright and being an outcast.

The villains are a Three Stooges-type trio, while naturally the single mother is still pining for a medical student she fell for over 14 years ago. ...sigh... Of course, that kind doctor, whose mother runs the music camp, is totally enthralled by this little girl who has so many of HIS traits! Every time little Patty appears as a singer, there he is in the audience, mouthing the words along with her with a big grin on his face. The actor is Ren Strickler as Papa, he sings, too!

Glad to see this one available on DVD. I never saw the whole telenovela, so this edited version from Amazon is good enough for me.",1367280000,,1319,4.6239316239316235
4384847,4,B004I9SJFC,"Ordene esta Telenovela En DVD, estoy ansioso por verla, espero que no me desepcione el Resumen. Me parece divertida e interesante. Cuando la tenga y vea les cuento que tal esta la Telenovela y el Resumen.
1/2/2013: Me gusto mucho la Telenovela, se me hizo entretenida y muy divertida. Me mantuvo espectante hasta que termine de ver el Disco 3, el Dvd 4 no me gusto tanto, no se si es por como esta resumido o porque al final la historia se hace un poco aburrida, sobretodo las partes de Kimberly y cuando aparece Giovanni. Ademas las canciones de los grupos me aburrieron muchisimo, son muy basicas, la verdad no me gustaron para nada.
En cuanto al Resumen de los Capitulos en general estan bien editados, tiene coherencia y se puede seguir el hilo de la Historia perfectamente. Como todas las Ediciones faltan algunas escenas pero no afecta en absoluto en el desarrollo de la trama.
Me hubiera gustado volver a ver algunas escenas que no estan en el DVD y que tubiera un poco mas de el Episodio de Acapulco, sobretodo la parte del Parque de Diversiones, de los Juegos, pero las escenas que dejaron son de la boda de Ana y Rodrigo, nada mas. Sin ser eso lo demas esta bien.
En sintesis, todo va bien hasta el Dvd 4, despues pierde emocion.",1357516800,,1239,4.511111111111111
4384848,4,B004I9SJFC,"I picked this set up at Target the other day, because it looked like a pretty good time. And it is. Some may be concerned that this is not entire episodes of the series. There were about 250 episodes all together, so to get them all in one set would be kind of impossible. What this is, though, is kind of a ""best of"" set. They've edited the main parts of all of the episodes together to form one big program. They're separated by ""episodes"" but they just play through everything. There are no opening or closing credits at the beginning of each one. This may sound like a horrible thing, but it's not at all. This is still a very watchable and enjoyable set. You will get all of the main plot points from the series here. I've only finished the first disc, however, so I'm not quite sure about the ending or anything. But no one has seemed to complain that they didn't finish it up. But as cheap as this set is, it's definitely worth a go. It's very addicting, though... So be prepared to get sucked in immediately. Hope this cleared some things up for you... I can't wait to see what happens to Patito and Mateo, and Ana and Rodrigo! :)",1351987200,9,1138,4.273148148148148

4384862,4,B004I9SJFC,"What's there to say except that it is a case of good news and bad news.

The bad news is that there's a lot missing from this version.
Including but not limited to: the side stories centering on the rest of the Populars (Los Populares), the Divines ( Las Divinas), the Classics (Los Klasicos), and the Basics (Los Basikos); the ""Freaky Friday"" switch between Bianca and Ana (and Patito and Antonella); Richie's feeling of inferiority when realizing that Patito doesn't like him the way he [initiallly] likes her; the full extent of the wedding and honeymoon in Alcapulco; the full extent of Patito and Antonella's friendship (when they're forced to tag team); Richie's frequent man-to-man meetings with Rene; and the Halloween episode--where the kids tell scary stories reminiscent of classic movie horror. In all it is mostly the story of Ana, Rodrigo, and Patito, and anyone who is directly or indirectly involved. I recognize it better with the secondary storylines than without.

The good news is...
The bottom line of the telenovela remains. The ensemble chemistry stays as it is, though reduced. The main characters are not written as if life revolves around them or stops at them, unlike typical American comedy-dramas. The music videos that appear before the closing credits are included. Subtitles are added, that way we (those of us who don't know or speak Spanish) don't have to guess what's going on through body language alone. A few side stories, like that of Bianca, Antonella, and Raymundo's broken family, still exist. Gustavo, Delfino, and Marina (guessing that is Ana's best friend's name) are not deducted. Most of all, the unviersal appeal of the coming-of-age story shows--edited or not.

All in all, it could have been better. Meaning this released version could have done without the deductions. I myself am more used to the extended televised version. But at the same time, I'm glad to have a version of the show where I don't have to take wild guesses at what is being said and/or thought. So I won't say I hate it or that I love it. I will say what I thought about it while it aired on Univision: Yes sir, I like it. I'm still fascinated by foreign television and film either way--shortened or extended.",1405468800,,2230,4.863157894736842
