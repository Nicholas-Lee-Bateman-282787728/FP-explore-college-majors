8507400,5,B00700X7C6,"Far beyond its days, great movie. There could have been a little more Rudy but the story line is good. Great shots of Rudy with a 7 day shadow.",1389571200,,143,3.9655172413793105
8507401,5,B00700X7C6,Loved it. Rex is uber visually gifted. Rudy is uber perfect. A plot that grows more interesting as the movie moves along. Great Valentino moments to the maximum. Get it. Complete your Valentino collection. It's a must. The more Valentino the better. To know him is to know him from as many angles as humanly possible.,1379376000,,317,4.678571428571429
8507402,5,B00700X7C6,"Quality:VERY GOOD.It's a black & white version. The soudtrack is made by a organ-pipes and I think it sounds good with a silent movie,I don't like new soundtracks with old silent movies at all!!! I was afraid to find a bad version of this movie before my purchase,because this movie is very old-7 reel-movie. But now I'm VERY happy because I could have a great version in my collection. You can see the fissures of the old exposed-film of this movie,but you can watch clear anyway;and I like it because if I couldn't see these cracks I feel myself as someone had snatched something...I love film's-cracks!!!We are on 1921 and Rodolfo is a young italian handsome actor and he is so naive that you must love him but you can see the new acting style he has developed yet...and he's going to have his top in ""The sheik"" on few months during the same year....and he's going to be THE LEGEND OF LOVE, like he wrote on his ""My private diary""on 1923 : ""I wanted love. I would like that my name were circling the world and during his round around the world my name could wake love worldwide"". And will be so  forever......BRAVO RODOLFO!!!malefica from Italy.",1365724800,5,1149,4.550724637681159
8507403,5,B00700X7C6,"If you are a Valentino fan you have to get this movie.  It is silent, but he so good in it!  You'll love the facial expresions.",1358467200,3,127,3.8461538461538463
8507404,5,B00700X7C6,"Rex Ingram was an ""okay"" director (at least to my thinking) and Alice Terry's part in just about anything could have been played by just about anyone.

But Valentino...Watch when the coach rolls into the village (where the uncle lives) when Valentino is talking to a hearing impaired villager.  And his expressions and actions upon entering the uncle's residence for the first time......Valentino could be so very funny, seemingly without effort.

If you are a Valentino fan (as I am) you have GOT to see him in stubble and later sporting a fake beard - well before he grew a real one that had barbers across the nation boiling mad!

What makes this pretty predicable story worthwhile (in addition to seeing Valentino) is June Mathis' touches.

If you think what you have seen on Youtube is the whole movie....think again....and order this movie.",1350345600,9,846,4.888111888111888
8507405,5,B00700X7C6,The item came on time and was packed in easey open container I would buy from this company again I haven't seen the movie of yet but I am sure that the DVD is without flaw,1339891200,3,171,3.7777777777777777
