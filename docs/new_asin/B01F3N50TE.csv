My review of the book:

Awesome book.  If you have a woodworking library, this book needs to be in it.  Besides the book, Paul Sellers has many, many videos online that demonstrate what he has in the text.

I have only one very minor complaint:  the text is small in size and not a font I find easy to read.  The book is so large that a large and more readable font might have made it too heavy to handle(?)",1500249600,,703,5.910891089108911
