7891112,4,6305522928,This film was quite a piece of artwork despite the absemce of Jackie Chan as the star. The film was however Chan's directoral debut and placed him at the center of the action. He did a fine job coreographing the fight sequences which turned out to be a mixture of excellent Kung Fu fighting and comedic turmoil. This film is a great pick for any Kung Fu film genre lover!!!,986169600,,373,4.3428571428571425
7891113,4,6305522928,"Jackie Chan only directed and choreographed the movie, but it doesn't meen the movie itself is a waste.  I felt the movie was directed great by chan, and the fight scenes were very ammusing, along with some funny and interesting characters.  Jackie should direct more films like this.  I reccomend this to anyone, especially to jackie fans, this was some of his best work (maybe even if it was directing).  And in my mind it's not the stars in the movie but tha action, styles, and entertainment.  Go see this one.",979430400,,514,4.604395604395604
7891114,1,6305522928,"if you get this movie because of Jackie, you'll spend the whole time  thinking, now where's Jackie.  Actually, you only get to see him in the  edited footage with him smoking ( a terrible habit he's quit)!  But he is  the stunt coordinator, and that is why they can advertise him.",964656000,3,280,4.411764705882353
