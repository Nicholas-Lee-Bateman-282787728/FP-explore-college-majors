8622464,5,B00GE9ZXYY,"I enjoyed it. Yes it's low budget, but a good story. Worth the time, especially if your from Wisconsin.",1446422400,,103,4.473684210526316
8622465,3,B00GE9ZXYY,"Got the movie for Ellen Muth, as I became a fan from watching the Dead Like Me series, and have it
on DVD.
Ellen is spot on the same actor in this low budget, B rated movie, which is acceptable for this part, but does make
her fall into the typecast realm. Ellen can break out of this rut, as she has shown in some of her other movies.
The movie has a plot, but is very choppy, and rambles from scene to scene. It is made up of older known (I barely recognized
Robert Loggia; he is so old), and younger, not so known actors, with the exception of Ellen Muth.
For some, this movie may be a stretch to get through, but as a Muth movie collector, it has a place with me.
If you are not a fan of any of the actors in this movie, then you might want to give it a pass.",1442880000,2,763,3.8354430379746836

8622469,5,B00GE9ZXYY,Sometime there are stupid laws that make  a movie possible.  The idea you could go to jail for selling margarine in Wisconsin in 1967 is one of those laws.,1404172800,,155,4.310344827586207
8622470,5,B00GE9ZXYY,Cool movie.  Really funny.  It was a fun to see all the different locations from our area in the film.,1399507200,,102,4.05
8622471,1,B00GE9ZXYY,"This movie was actually painful to watch.  Lead actor was poorly chosen, supporting cast was better.  Bianca Keitel was the best actor in the movie.",1398297600,,148,4.88
8622472,5,B00GE9ZXYY,I lloved this movie it's to bad that this will be Ellen Anna Muth's movie she is now a head master at a acting school in Millford Conn. i wish her the best of luck she was a great actor.

8622473,5,B00GE9ZXYY,"The production of Margarine Wars was a long and sometimes incredibly chaotic journey.  But when the dust settled, a wonderful, unique and very quirky movie emerged.  Everyone who worked on this film is proud of it.

Congratulations to everyone on the team, especially to an extraordinarily talented and driven Writer-Producer, David Rich ... who accidentally became an extraordinarily talented and driven film Director on the journey to bring Margarine Wars to life.

Bravo David - you did it!",1393286400,2,493,5.282051282051282
