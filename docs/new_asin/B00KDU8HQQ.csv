Ive been obsessed with these films since I was 5 years old in 1986.  I can recite them all word for word.  I may even pre-order two of them to keep one sealed for my collection.  STOKED!!!!!!!!

First of all it looks dope with the black, it has a cool box with Michael Myers and each film is seperate with the original poster cover.  The reason for the 5 stars is because at the top the main pic shows what i got so i can't complain.  BUT.. it would be nice to be given an option sellers.. for future buyers please put which version in description your selling.

6422239,3,B00KDU8HQQ,"I bought the 10 disc set. I was very disappointed to see that the original Halloween has had its color slightly desaturated. My original blu ray has the color in the movie. That slight orange tint to everything, especially the outside shots. This version makes it look like a dull cloudy summer day. I was extremely disappointed. Similar to how the second dvd release of Madman and how they took out the blue hue of the moon. Now because of this, I'll have to keep my original single movie blu ray of halloween.

Halloween: The Complete Collection Version 1:
Halloween: The Complete Collection is a Blu-ray release of the entire Halloween Francish since Rob Zombie's Halloween II: Family is Forever. I'll be reviewing the 15 Disc Limited Deluxe Edition Boxset. This Boxset is the first release of Halloween 6 Producer Cut. Along with  many other bonus features. For the Hardcore Halloween Fans this is the ideal Boxset. If you want a cheaper Boxset then the V2 Boxset is for you it just won't have the Producers Cut and the TV versions of Halloween 1 and 2.",1503619200,2,552,4.872340425531915

6422245,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"""What's the Boogeyman?"" I am a die hard fan of the entire series. I grew up watching it as a young boy on repeat every Halloween usually via AMC or renting it from Blockbuster and my dad also had them in vintage VHS.

Anyways, this collection was a MUST have for me and every other die hard fan and/or horror film collector. I bought the limited/deluxe 15 disc edition. I was pleased I got this whole set brand new for about $90. (Yikes look at the price now)

All in all this set had everything I could ask for.. My favorite slasher films, in high quality blu-ray with multiple special features as well as different cuts of some of the movies. I'm so glad they finally put these together in a set.

BTW I have watched every single movie and have not had any audio sync or picture issues at all. I had read that Halloween 4 had audio sync issues back in 2014 but this was later fixed by Anchor Bay and Scream Factory therefore there is no need to worry about that.",1497312000,3,964,4.228260869565218

Everyone was posting pictures of how theirs came in a box with all the separate DVD containers but mine came with only two DVD boxes with all the DVDs stuffed in both. I really wish it would have come with the separate dvds, even though this is useful because it's less likely to get lost this way. I'm actually super excited it came though because I'm a HUGE fan of the Halloween movies and I just HAD to buy this. I have yet to watch them as I just received it today, but I will be updating when I have. The only reason it's 4 stars is because I really wanted it to be each separate dvd, not lumped into two separate boxes.

And I love they threw the producers cut of Halloween 6 in. First time I've got to see it clearly and not on a bootleg VHS. As far as the extras there's nothing new, but they put the best version of every release on there to my knowledge. Nothing I haven't seen, but also nothing is missing. Packaging is great, I dig the book, solid collection.",1480464000,3,505,4.270833333333333

6422269,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"As a lifelong fan of the HALLOWEEN series (I saw the original Carpenter classic in theaters at the age of 6, and every subsequent entry on opening day), I honestly can't imagine anyone being happier than I was to explore this amazing box set. In all of my years of collecting films on home video, this is quite simply the coolest, most satisfying box set I have ever owned.
  However, while there is no rating high enough to accurately reflect my love for this set, I have to remember that my opinion is biased due to my long love affair with the series, and I have to remain impartial in this review. Hence, my honest opinion is that this wonderful treat for the fans merits 4 stars out of 5.
  In no way is the rating based on the quality of the films themselves; only hardcore fans will shell out the bucks for this, and they already love the series and have their favorites. Instead, the rating is based solely on the A/V quality herein, the extras, and the overall presentation of the set.
  For beginners, let's outline the many positives.  First off, the physical set itself is absolutely gorgeous. A sturdy, attractive artwork-adorned box houses ten black eco-cases containing 15 discs and featuring all ten films and 5 discs of bonus content. Each case showcases the original poster art for the entry within, and the discs themselves also follow this theme, bringing a lovely unifiying quality to the set. Also included is an attractive, full-color 44-page minibook that features a length, pleasantly comprehensive essay on the series by long-time Fangoria contributor Michael Gingold. Packaging is a strong 4.5/5 stars.
  The extra features on the discs themselves are also a home run. From the full-length TV cuts of HALLOWEEN and HALLOWEEN II to the beautifully restored, never-before-available Producer's Cut of HALLOWEEN 6, from brand-new episodes of ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds"" to the new lengthy ""making of"" featurettes of HALLOWEEN 4, 5, 6 and H2O, from old and new and exclusive commentaries to the massive four-and-a-half documentary that details the making of Rob Zombie's 2007 remake, the bonus bells and whistles alone will keep you busy for at least a week. Hardcore fans may snipe about the occasional extra from a previous release not ported over to this set (all the fault of one of the box's co-producers, Anchor Bay), I can't imagine any of them having their enjoyment of the frankly stunning amount of extras here affected.. Another sterling 4.5/5 score.
  Unfortunately, the few negative aspects of this collection come in the worst possible place: the A/V presentation of some of the films themselves. I've seen more than one Blu-Ray review let a film's weak or disappointing picture/sound off the hook because of superlative bonus features; I just can't do that. The films are the reason we're here and what we truly love, and should always be the top priority. And while the majority of the series looks and sounds excellent to near-reference, some entries are lacking.
  The original HALLOWEEN is the Dean Cundey-supervised transfer from Anchor Bay's 35th anniversary Blu-Ray, and it's magnificent. This is the first time the theatrical release has been successfully replicated on home video. Scream Factory's discs of HALLOWEEN II and HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF THE WITCH also feature top-notch transfers and audio. Things begin to get iffy with Anchor Bay's truly disappointing treatment of  HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS. 4 featured the best photography of any of of Michael's 1.85:1 entries, only to suffer from a muddled, barely-above-standard-def picture and listless audio. Thing's improve a little with HALLOWEEN 5: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS' (again, from Anchor Bay) picture and audio in particular, but not much.
  Then we come to Dimension's entries. These films saw their home video rights licensed to Echo Bridge Entertainment a few years back, and as any genre fan knows. they are truly one of the worst in the business. As a result, and despite receiving a once-over cleaning from Scream Factory, HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS, HALLOWEEN: H20 and HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION all sport weaker, muddied pictures than entries produced twenty years prior. This trifecta of triteness is thankfully broken up by the first-ever presentation of the legendary Producer's Cut of HALLOWEEN 6 on home video. Scream Factory's transfer is light years better than its Theatrical Cut counterpart.
  Wrapping things up are Sony's previously released discs of Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN (2007) and HALLOWEEN II (2009). I've heard gripes because these are the Unrated Director's Cuts only; the Theatrical Cuts are not included. Blame that I. Sony, who refused to license them for the set. That issue aside, these two final discs sport reference-quality picture and sound that perfectly reflect the original intent of the filmmakers. So, in all, the A/V quality of the set merits a fair but in no way perfect score of 3/5 stars, leaving the set as a whole with 4/5 overall. As I said earlier, I only see die-hard supporters buying this, and for them I can't recommend this set enough. And if Anchor Bay does as I suspect they will and restores HALLOWEEN 4 & 5 for a fan-insulting double-dip, I plan on switching them with these and improving this box set.",1479340800,9,5296,5.005688282138794

  1) I live in Europe so I can't watch this great box set in my country as I can't afford expensive blu ray multi players.

 2) At least I have a multi dvd player but still I can't watch this box set cause it's blu ray and cause they did not bothered to release this stuff also in dvd.

  So if u live in America this gets 5 stars but if u live elsewhere IT SUCKS NOT TO BE ABLE TO OWN YOUR FAV SLASHERS AND I WONDER WHY THEY DID NOT MADE THIS A REGION FREE LIKE THEY DID WITH JASON AND CHUCKY PREVIOUS BLU RAY MEGA BOX SETS.

6422279,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"20th Century Fox did a hell of a job with the Alien Anthology, and Warner Bros. did an equally outstanding job with Blade Runner (what is it with Ridley Scott movies?), but this is my favorite Blu-Ray set ever. It includes absolutely everything you could possibly want with the exception of the watered down theatrical cuts of the Rob Zombie films.

The biggies here are the TV cuts of the first two and the producer's cut of Halloween 6. I think the original version of Halloween is a perfectly paced movie, but it's nice to have the extended version anyway. Same with Halloween II. Halloween 6, however, is a totally different movie (in a good way). I've been familiar with the producer's cut for a while, but it's nice to see those new scenes seamlessly branched in hi-definition. It looks great. I'm just not crazy about the ending.

6422291,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Came in sealed and undamaged! Husband loves it!,1470960000,,47,5.0
6422292,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"Great set! But why am I giving it only 4 instead of 5 stars? It deserves 5 right? Well for the fact that all these different companies came together to produce the set yes, but there are a few things missing that would make it a really complete set. First off, this is like I said, a great set. It has almost everything a huge fan of the series, such as myself, would love. Not to mention the great extras that are on various discs and the exclusive extras on disc 15. Since this has all that why complain about anything at all? Well, it's not so much of a complaint as it is a should have had it kind of thing.

The theatrical versions of the Rob Zombie movies are missing, I would have loved those added to keep the ""complete"" more, uh, complete for the OCD collector in me. Along with the documentary ""25 Years Of Terror"", which was omitted as well. Also which I don't mind it being missing (though like I said, the OCD collector in me would have loved) is the Halloween 4 extra ""Halloween 4/5 Discussion Panel"". I know it was not an extra the majority of folks miss, and I can understand. I really don't care that it is gone either, but that damn ""completest"" collector in me wanted it. LOL!

The final reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the cases. While I love the black, I do not care for the ""eco"" type cases. They tend to ruin the artwork over time. If I knew where to get non eco type black cases (including the 2 disc ones) I would definitely swap out. I guess I will just buy some regular blue blu ray cases to swap.

Now I didn't buy the movie from here or any third party here, I got it else where, it was new and still sealed, but curiously it didn't include the audio sync error disc for part 4. The corrected disc was in the case instead. So I am guessing either I got a re released version or where I got it from, the company just replaced the discs and resealed the box. Again, the OCD/completest in me would have loved to have the error disc (since it matches the other discs in the set, whereas the corrected disc does not), I could do without the corrected disc since I have part 4 on blu ray already (the one with the discussion panel not on this copy). But beside those very petty complaints, this has got to be the best box set of any movies that have ever come out. The booklet that comes with it is a great read (not to mention shows the ""extras"" contents of the bonus 15th disc), great publicity photos in it as well. I highly recommend this version over the 10 disc one, unless you just want the movies, but know the 10 disc one is missing a ton of the extras AND the producer's cut of part 6. The producer's cut is now available on it's own but doesn't have the bonus features or theatrical version.",1470787200,,2728,4.153119092627599

6422346,4,B00KDU8HQQ,This is a great set to get all the collection on blu. I only took a star off for not including the theatrical cut of rzs halloween and for halloween 4 audio glitch which made it unwatchable for weeks until I got the replacement. It includes all the movies from halloween to rz halloween 2. The video and audio quality are great but they are not new transfers which takes some points off. Including the producers cut of halloween 6 fully restored is the biggest highlight here as well as new features for some of the movies. The previous documentaries were carried over. The extended cut of halloween is included as a special feature. This is great though id prefer it pn an individual disc. All in all this is a great set for those who don't own the movies. Those who plan to replace their collection with this should do some research first.,1456617600,,841,4.467532467532467

6422365,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"This box set is so cool!  On one side of the packaging, there's a picture of Michael Myers, on another, a picture of the Jack O Lantern from the opening of the first movie, on the other side, a picture of trees with cars in the background in Haddonfield.  The booklet inside is informative and talks about behind the scenes and production of all 10 movies.  The movies come packaged in individual black Blu-Ray cases and they have their theatrical posters on the cover of their cases.

The box set contains 15 discs, and contains:
-Halloween (1978)-2 discs- 3 commentaries; Featurettes: The Night She Came Home; On Location: 25 Years Later; TV version footage; Theatrical Trailer; TV and Radio Spots.
-Halloween II (1981)-2 discs- Theatrical and TV versions; 2 commentaries; The Nightmare isn't Over (Making Of); Horror's Hallowed Grounds; Deleted Scenes and Alternate Ending with optional commentary; Still Gallery; Theatrical Trailer; TV and Radio Spots.
-Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)-1 disc- 1 commentary; Stand Alone: The Making of Halloween III: Season of the Witch; Horror's Hallowed Grounds; Still Gallery; Theatrical Trailer; TV Spots.
-Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988)-1disc- 2 commentaries; Theatrical Trailer.
-Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989)-1 disc- 2 commentaries; Halloween 5: On the Set; Original Promo; Theatrical Trailer.

- Bonus Disc- Making of Halloween 4; Making of Halloween 5; Interview with Makeup Effects Artist for Halloween III; Horror's Hallowed Ground episodes for Halloween 4, 5, 6, and extended version of 1.

There are a couple of issues I have with this set, though they are minor.  My first issue is that the Theatrical versions of Rob Zombie's Halloween and Halloween II are not included.  They are my favorite versions of each movie and it would have been nice to have them included.  My other issue is that the bonus disc is packaged with Rob Zombie's Halloween II instead of getting its own case.  In my 1999 box set for A Nightmare on Elm Street, the bonus disc comes in its own case.  Other than those minor issues, I have no complaints about this box set.  This and my A Nightmare on Elm Street box set are both amazing.

If you are a fan of the Halloween movies and if you want all the special features, then this is a must buy!  It is well-worth the money you pay for it.  If you want to get this specifically for the Producer's Cut of Halloween 6, then there is an individual Blu-Ray release of it now.  I recommend this set to anyone who likes the movies!",1451606400,2,3991,5.414516129032258

6422372,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"Very good set for fans of the series.

Halloween (1978)  Exceptional transfer. Same as the single disc 35th Anniversary release. Picture/sound rating: 5/5

Halloween II (1981)  Very good transfer, save for a few scenes  most notably: Laurie's hospital room, when Jimmy finds her in a catatonic state; and the doctor's lounge, when Janet comes to tell Dr. Mixter that Laurie has had a reaction to her medication. Both scenes exhibit heavy grain in their dark backgrounds, which stand in stark contrast to an otherwise crisp and vibrant transfer. Bottom line: Overall, this is the best Halloween II has ever looked on video. Picture/sound rating: 4/5

Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)  By far the best this movie has ever looked, with a full-bodied color palette and vibrant primaries throughout. Black levels are particularly rich. Shadow details are superb, but the fine grain structure is abit more pronounced during several nighttime exterior scenes. For a mono soundtrack, the dynamic range is remarkably sharp and detailed. Picture/sound rating: 4.5/4

Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988)  The standard definition DVD version of this film is one of the better looking non-anamorphic discs ever released (the best is Strange Days). That said, this HD transfer is solid, with better overall definition and clarity. There is a bit of noise in the white areas, but the black levels are deep, and the color palette is bold and accurately rendered. The sound is nothing special. Dialogue is strong, but don't expect an amazing surround experience. Picture/sound rating: 4/3.5

Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989)  A slightly better transfer than Halloween 4, with crisp images and nicely rendered blacks, though there are a few blurry shots along the way. Very good audio, with excellent clarity. Picture/sound rating: 4/4

Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995)  A fairly crisp transfer, though it is said that the producer's cut (which is not included in this set) is even better. Colors are nicely rendered, with deep blacks and solid contrast throughout. The sound is very good, with crisp clear dialogue and nice surround effects. Picture/sound rating: 4.5/4.5

Halloween: H20 (1998)  Again, the standard def DVD version of this film is one of the better looking non-anamorphic discs ever released. That said, while this HD transfer (finally presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio) offers better definition and resolution and detailing throughout, it's a bit softer, with several blurry moments. But the color and black levels are rich and true. Dialogue is clear and strong, the music score is powerful and sets the mood well. Picture/sound rating: 4/4

Halloween: Resurrection (2002)  A mixed and messy trick-or-treat bag (which, arguably, may be all this unnecessary sequel deserves), with sharpness and black levels that fluctuate between HD quality to VHS quality, poor Shadow delineation, and a bland color palette. The audio isn't much better, with the music often drowning out the dialogue. Conversely, the sound effects are atmospheric and mixed around the channels nicely. Picture/sound rating: 2.5/2.5

6422380,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"The collection is great. It contains all the original Halloween movies as well as the Rob Zombie reboots. My thoughts on the series:

Halloween 1 & 2
I'd highly recommend watching them in the original order. I watched the Rob Zombie cuts and later realized they're loosely reboots of H1 and H2. Frankly, when you see the Halloween 1 & 2 stories as interpreted by Rob Zombie, the originals all the sudden seem to drag.

Halloween 3
While many may not like that Halloween 3 isn't a Michael Myers film, I think it's great. The story is sinister and it moves at a great pace. Frankly, I wish they spun it off into its own set of films with John Carpenter's original intention of a different story line each year.

The Rest
Great movies but frankly, they lose some magic when you are trying to watch a horror film featuring say . . . Busta Rhymes, or LL Cool J : /",1447804800,,859,4.290123456790123

6422382,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"The Halloween Franchsie gets the best Blu Ray collection release of the three horror giants of the 80s. The collection comes in 10 discs and 15 discs versions, but neither is perfect. Two things (maybe three?) keep this set from being the definative set. The first being a new master should have been struck to create the fall season color timing instead of using the 35th anniversary edition. Watching this one and the  Color Timed"" version located on the second disc shows  hardly any difference with neither showing the look Carpenter had intended if he had the funds while making the film in 1978 (which Im told is found on the Criterion Laser disc and possibly the 1999 DVD). The film looks great, but it you're going to go through the trouble of including two versions of the film, then why not correct the problem that has been present for so many video releases. It should be noted that the bonus material and commentary found on this disc is quite good and fairly long, so the disc isn't a total loss.

Another disappointment is that they should have included both versions of Zombies two films instead of the unrated editions which are not as good as the theatrical versions. Lastly, most discs have a very small amount of bonus material. Since the exclusive bonus disc covers all of the movies, it seems like that bonus content could have been pieced out on coinsiding discs with that film on it. This would have left room for The 25 Years of Terror as a bonus disc or a new documentary to really make this set the definative edition collection.

While this may sound like Im ranting Im not, this is by far the best collection of the Halloween franchise and it is also far superior to the treatments that Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Saw received. So getting back to the content of this collection, beside the first two discs being extremely similar, we come to discs 3 and 4 which hold Halloween II and the TV version of the film which are quite different. The TV version has at least 20 minutes of alternate footage, but only runs a few minutes longer than the theatrical version. The films look very good, but natually the TV version is cropped for television viewing.

Disc 5 holds Halloween III, it is a film fans of the franchise love or hate. I personally like it a lot. Though it is a bit confusing and inconherent at times, it is a strange nightmare of a movie. The good news is it looks great here on Blu Ray by far the best it ever has. Disc 6 holds Halloween 4 once again looking the best it ever has, in fact all of the films look quite good and if there are any complaints with any of the discs its that
the bonus features are very light on the individual discs. Disc 7 holds Halloween 5, and then we get to Halloween 6 on discs 8 and 9. The
theatrical and the infamous producers cut. No matter what version you watch, by this film the franchise is wearing pretty thin. Im not a big fan of either version, but it did give us Paul Rudd!

Halloween H20 ( disc 10), is one of the better sequels and has a good amount of bonus material on it. Ditto Halloween Resurrection on disc 11. Disc 12 and 13 are Rob Zombies Halloween unrated cut and all the extras ported over from the orignal 2 disc release. Disc 14 holds Robs Halloween II and disc 15 is the exclusive bonus disc. The bouns disc is very good with features from all of the films including yet a third version of the original Halloween, this time widescreen with the full screen TV scenes woven in. Its a nice extra among many others on this disc, but like I had mentioned before the segments would have been more accessible if they were included on the disc with that film on it. As far as the Zombie films, I like them, but they really don't offer anything that the originals didn't do better and without so much on screen violence. I prefer the theatrical versions because they seem to flow better, although there are pieces I prefer from the unrated cuts as a whole the theatrical versions are superior. Fortunately a 2 disc Blu Ray has been released with both theatrical cuts to complete the series.

Its hard to not give this a 5 star rating, but I have to deduct 1 star for a little bit of laziness by not including the theatrical releases of both
Zombie films, stripping the individual discs down of bonus material and while including 3 versions of the original film, none of them are the preferred color timed version that should have been a main selling point for this collection. Still this is a no brainer for fans of the series and since I found the 15 discs version for around $80 I'm completely happy with the upgrade.",1447718400,3,4630,4.414519906323185
6422383,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"If you ever wanted a boxset, this is it. You get all 10 of the movies on Blu ray plus you get the original TV of the original Halloween on Blu ray for the first time & it makes the original DVD look like crap compared to the new transfer. Plus the TV cut of the original part 2 is on DVD only, its not the best quality looking, as it looks like the original bootleg copy with a slight upgrade & the only one in full screen. Still not bad to have them all. Also you get a book that talks about each movie & details about them with pictures. I also love this set do to having the Producer's Cut of H6. So if you don't already own the bare bones of the Producer's Cut on Blu ray, get this set. You have hours of new features that makes it worth owning. I'm glad I got my set @ $84.99 here on Amazon when it was on sale. So get your copy now before it goes oop, cuz I gotta feeling that by the new year, it'll be gone & only left will be the 10 disc set only. If you are a true Halloween fan, then don't miss your only opportunity to own this set before it to late. Michael Myers will live on in my home for along time",1447545600,4,1114,3.7854077253218885

6422386,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"It's really hard to recommended this limited edition (wink wink) BR box set mostly cause
almost all the films will be a double or triple dip purchase
the Halloween II (tv cut is very cool but, it's a dvd (SD)  they cheaped out on this big time)
you get two different version of Halloween 666 (The original theatrical cut and the infamous Producers Cut)
Lots of cool extras for the Producer's cut
There's a decent list of **new** exclusives
but, there's also a decent list of ported extras  from the other previous released BR
Halloween H20 has a new commentary track with Steve Miner & Jamie Lee Curtis (which is a bit odd since Steve Miner is associated more with the Friday the 13th Films but, he's to good to do any commentary on those films?)

The massive minus with this box set (If you are a huge Halloween Fan like myself you already bought all the Halloween Films on HD blu ray's long before this limited set hit the market so if you want this set you're gonna do a lot of double dipping

I'm a huge Scream Factory fan but, this is by far the shadiest thing they ever did  to the consumers/fans!  if you been collecting film for 15-20 years you will not be surprised that Anchor Bay/Starz did this though
This is a very odd box set overall it's nowhere near as horrible as The Last so-called Limited BR Box Set of Back to the Future is
but, it's really not limited (the distributor just tacked that on to scare fans into buying it asap)
Real limited box sets would be Scream Factory's Nightbreed BR Box set or Arrow Video's Hellraiser trilogy Scarlet boxset
It's a massive gamble overall a year later still very easy to get  8.8/10",1447286400,9,1639,4.4072847682119205

6422428,3,B00KDU8HQQ,"Make no mistake, if you're a fan of the franchise, this is unquestionably THE best product to buy!  You'll definitely want to add it to your collection!  Sadly, as others have noted, there's a lot lacking and to great extent it seems cheaper than it really should.

The botched/recalled copy of Halloween 4 is possibly the best indicator of just how little effort ultimately went into this product.  It seems all the money went into licensing and the distribution agreement and little was left over for the kind of product quality and unsurpassed collect-ability that the marketing and price convey.

It's not just that it fails to be the best it can be.  Seemingly it fails to even try.  From a critical dvd-quality tv cut, to poor quality control and seemingly no testing, to missing extras, to eco-cases that many/most collectors who want to OWN these films in a set like this detest, this product will ultimately go down as an over-hyped, over-marketed, missed opportunity.

Of course it does bring with it at least one notable exclusive - well... exclusive for a time:  the long awaited producers cut of 666.  But there's just so much more that could have been done that the price seems too steep for a mostly regurgitated repackaging of titles already available, most of which didn't get all that impressive a release to begin with.  Shout's celebrated BDs for the second and third films don't even include the reversible covers, as if they want to give fans a reason to buy or not sell off the stand-alone editions too.  And, clearly, ""Limited Edition"" doesn't mean ANYTHING anymore.  I think by ""limited"" they mean they produced just enough to meet current demand with some to grow, based on the current market projections.  Collectors ten years from now, ""might"" be out of luck, ""if someone doesn't produce an even better package before then"".

As cheesy as some of these films are, I'm one of those who loves rewatching them during the season.  If you're the same, this set is a no-brainer.  But try to catch it on sale and don't set your expectations too high, as neither Shout nor Anchor Bay seemed to either.",1439942400,,2121,4.751366120218579

I had seen most of these movies via cable marathons etc, and many of these movies are quite terrible lol, but fun to watch on or around Halloween. This collection features good extras although haven't viewed them all yet and I like the dark tinted plastic cases. I bought this to add to my horror collection and it was worth it. Many complain about audio sync trouble regarding the 5th movie, yes it is noticeable, in some scenes more than others but not enough to mar a fairly average movie overall.

6422469,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I bought this collection awile ago, not planning on doing a reveiw on it, because I had all the movies before but just not in a box set or on Blue Ray.  Almost done watching the movies again from the box set which has now prompted me to write this review.  quite honestly I was shocked at some points watching the films again, as I watched the films I noticed they were slightly different from what I remembered from the DVD version but a whole alot better amd here's why.  If I could give this collection 10 stars I would gladlyd do so.  You see everyone that had a part in making these movies back in the day came together to create this box set the way they intended it to be done, and more importantyly to celebrate the creators of this legendary film.  That also means Anchor Bay movies got the rights back to all the movies in the collection, the Original movies that is.  When Universal got ahold of the films and started releasing the films thay altered almost all of the movies in some degree adding and removing scenes.  which made the movies lamer in way.  sometimes annoying especially in Halloween 3 with the kids watching the tv screen of the silver shamerock commercial counting down each day with the annoying commercial from 5 days all the way down to one complete overkill.  The final movie was also hollywoodised alot to fit that era, but just turned into a lame movie with stupid teenagers.  Wih this box set though you get every single movie shown in its original form the way we werte always supposed to see these films.  The changes can be found alot on the first Halloween, and Halloween 2.  The you see tthe original version of Halloween 3 the commercial part every 10 minutes gone, the slow plot line that didn't make sense till the end gone, totally makes sense now and creepy as hell I might add.  4 and 5 are the most similar to what I remember with only a few minor changes.  Halloween 6 the curse of michael myers totally different long story line with loomis in the office gonel, and general weirdness like the movie didn't fit the series gone.  You get more info on the curse that was put on michael myers in the beginning with the new recruit as in the form as a newborn baby leading to her escape all the way to the hospital.  You see the little boys dreams and how he sees michael meyers with a voice telling him to kill for him.  Danny is the character of the boy just wanted to clarify and a better climax and ending with more michael.  H20 haven't watched yet but don't know what to expect now cant wait to see the original.  and finally ressurection I put the film in at the beginning to see if it was different oh yeah it is finally the true ending to a amazing series.  Laurie strode is in the final movie in the beginning what where did she come from I thought it was only lame ass kids on a halloween contest in the meyers house.  Awsome just Awsome.  DId I mention you get both remakes the way they wanted them done as well.  Truly the ultimate collection.",1431216000,4,3001,4.3291592128801435

Now my first and probably only complaint is that the paper slip cover on the outside of the box has some super adhesive gum holding it on and it's just impossible to remove without  damaging the box. Not a huge deal honestly.

I won't go into detail and explain all the features of the box set. The review made by Ron2900 has all of that, so be sure to check it out.

I will say that there are two particular details I will mention; the Theatrical version of Rob Zombies Halloween is not in this set, and Halloween 666, or Halloween 6 Producers Cut or whatever you prefer to call it, IS in this set.

The theatrical of RZ's Halloween not being in this is a real shame. But the Producers Cut being included made up for it to me. I've never seen it and I'm unbelievably excited to view it in a full HD transfer!",1428364800,,1041,4.185

6422503,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"For horror/slasher fans, its a dream come true. Finally!  One of the most iconic horror franchises ever created has been presented in a deluxe box set with all the killings, gore, extras and more. Amazon describes this set as being a limited edition but I don't see anything that indicates a limited edition on the box, it just says 15-disc deluxe edition.

The Halloween franchise has been going strong for more than 35 years and has generated 10 films to date, well only 9 when you really think about it. The third film Halloween III had absolutely nothing to do with the others and it should have been renamed as a standalone film years ago. I really think that Shout! and Anchor Bay Entertainment have truly given fans what theyve always wanted with this one. These really are the best video & audio transfers that I have ever seen or heard although the soundtrack in Halloween lll is still a disappointment for me. I really like Halloween lll as a horror movie and I've always wanted to hear it in 5.1. The long awaited official Producers Cut of Halloween 6: The curse of Michael Myers is definitely the highlight of this set, the ending is much different than the theatrical version. The bonus features really explained why it's so different. I didn't encounter any playback problems or sound issues with any of the discs in the set. This set is awesome!

After watching all the movies again, I have a better understanding and new appreciation for the franchise. The wealth of bonus features provided, have definitely answered most of the questions I had about certain films over the years.

The original Halloween in my opinion is still the best of them all. Even though it has a low body count and very little blood its definitely packed with plenty of scares. The story, acting and the eerie musical score from John Carpenter makes this a true classic worth owning. This film set the bar for all of the other horror/slasher and copycat films that followed. In 1963 Michael Myers stabbed his sister to death and was institutionalized. Jump ahead 15 years, Michael Myers has escaped from the institution and hes coming back home for his revenge!

Halloween ll is a solid sequel and the story could have ended there but it could have easily continued into a true third film and gone out with a bang! This film picks up directly where Halloween left off and keeps the storyline running nicely along. In Halloween ll, we learn that Laurie Strode is Michaels sister. Michael Myers learns the truth about Laurie and he has come back home to finish the job he started. A much higher body count with more blood and gore this time around.

Halloween III had absolutely nothing to do with the series and it really shouldnt be part of this set. As a standalone movie its pretty decent and it really should have been renamed or rebranded as something entirely different. I don't have anything against Halloween lll as a horror movie, I absolutely love the story. I just feel it isn't part of the franchise. The movie doesnt include Michael Myers or any of the original story line at all.

Halloween 4 is when the series took another turn. While we do see the return of Michael Myers we don't see Jamie lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. It seems that Michael Myers has come back to Haddonfield to pick up where he left off. This time Michaels target is Laurie Strodes orphaned Daughter, Jamie Llyod. In this movie we learn that Jamie Lloyd is Michaels niece. In this storyline it states that Laurie was killed and her daughter was adopted. The part about Lauries death never made much sense with me and I always wondered why theyd kill her off. Michael Myers terrorises Haddonfield once again until he is finally confronted and gunned down and believed to be dead. As for Jamie Lloyd, her story is really just beginning.

Halloween 5, Hes back! It seems that Michael Myers is truly indestructible. Not only did he survive the barrage of bullets, he survived the mine collapse and explosion as well. At the end of Halloween 4 we see Jamie Lloyd touch Michaels hand before he is gunned down. Jamie realises that she has a psychic bond with Michael and that hes coming back to Haddonfield for his revenge. Dr. Loomis played by the incredible Donald Pleasence thinks he knows how to kill Michael once and for all but hell have to go back to where it all began and Jamie will be used to set the trap. Loomis finally stops Michael and he is taken to the police station until he can be taken to a maximum-security prison until he dies. In Halloween 5 were also introduced to a mysterious man in black, who is he? Is it finally over?

Not so fast, In Halloween 6: The curse of Michael Myers we see Jamie Lloyd now played by J.C. Brandy all grown up and ready to give birth. It seems that Jamie was taken by a cult and kept in some sort of underground facility. After giving birth in the facility, the baby is quickly taken by a mysterious dark figure in a black and brought to a sacrificial alter and a symbol is written on the babys stomach in blood. Jamie is aided by one of the nurses and she is able to escape her captors but someone else is after her. You guessed it, Hes back!

Michael tracks down Jamie and exacts his revenge on her but her baby is nowhere to be found. The baby is later discovered by Tommy Doyle, yes the same Tommy that Laurie Strode used to babysit. Tommy learns the secret of the symbol and the cult behind it and seeks the help of Dr. Loomis played for the last time by Donald Pleasence: I don't think any other actor could have played that role any better. In the final 20 minutes we will learn the identity of the man in black and the cult that wants Jamies baby. Well see Tommy take out his anger on Michael but what about the ending and the fate of Dr. Loomis? This all refers to the theatrical version as the producers cut is much different and so is the ending. If you watch the bonus features with Malek Akkad, he discusses why Danielle Harris didn't return as Jamie and the struggles to get the film made. He also explains why the two versions are different and goes on to explain that even the producers cut isn't the final version they had intended for Halloween 6.

In Halloween H20, we see the return of Jamie Lee Curtis as Keri Tate/Laurie Strode. What! How can this be? It stated in Halloween 4 that Laurie Strode had been killed. So let me see if I understand this, Laurie Strode was killed and her character didn't appear in either Halloween 4 or 5. How can her character, really make a comeback at this point? Fear not, all will be revealed.

It's been 20 years since the horror in Haddonfield. In H2O Laurie Strode is living under the identity of Keri Tate, now the headmistress of a private school and she also has a teenage son. Looking back at Halloween 4, it never said how Laurie was killed. How is it that Laurie Strode is back from the dead and living as Keri Tate some twenty years later? Did she fake her death and change her identity to escape the wrath of Michael Myers? I think the writers came up with a really good way to re-introduce Jamie Lee Curtis into the franchise in the only way that made sense. The film has a pretty good story and contains a fair amount of blood and gore. This one ends with a final showdown between Laurie and Michael. Could it be? Is the nightmare finally over?  Cue the music. This film could have easily been the story for Halloween lll and probably should have been the final instalment.

Can it be possible? Halloween Resurrection, Michael Myers is back again. I really thought this franchise was completely done after the ending in H2O but it seems I was wrong. After watching the bonus features for H2O, I learned that H2O was supposed to be the end for Michael Myers but Moustapha Akkad had other ideas. I really think that the films creators came up with a very creative way to bring Michael back this time. When the film starts we find Laurie Strode locked in a Sanitarium and she appears to be out of it but appearances can be deceiving. Its clear within the first 10 minutes that Laurie didn't kill Michael at the end of H2O after all. The chase is over pretty quick, Michael finds Laurie and their story is finally over. The rest of the movie is about a group of teens who decide to spend the night in Michael Myers childhood home and broadcast everything live, via the web. What starts out as some teenage fun, turns into real horror for the teens as Michael comes home. One by one the teens will fall. Other than the beginning, this is probably the weakest of the Halloween movies for me but the ending did leave the door open for?

In regards to the last two films included in the set, they are the Rob Zombie Halloween (2007) and Halloween ll (2009) versions. Im extremely loyal to the originals and frown upon remakes of any kind, so I had to go into these with an open mind. If it was Robs intention to re-invent the story of Michael Myers in his own way and pay homage to the originals, I think he succeeded to a point.

His versions are definitely more violent, bloody and brutal than the originals ever were. Laurie Strode, played by Scout Taylor-Compton is tossed around and brutally beaten way more than Jamie Lee Curtis was when she played Laurie in the originals. Malcolm McDowell did a pretty good job as Dr. Loomis and to compare him to Donald Pleasence, just wouldnt be fair. Donald Pleasence defined the role of Dr. Loomis. The newer versions have far too much profanity and I found most of the profanity was useless dialogue that didn't add anything to the movies.

As for Halloween ll by Rob Zombie. We see more of Michael Myers roaming around with his mask off than with it on. In the scenes with it off, he looks more like a mountain man than Michael Myers. Most of those scenes made it feel like just another horror movie to me. The story line for Dr. Loomis in Halloween ll was pretty flat, he wasn't really involved in the story as far as Michael was concerned until the very end. I didn't like the direction that the second film took and I didn't care much for Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie this time around. I really don't know what else to say, I really feel Halloween ll missed the mark. I really wonder what Moustapha Akkad would have thought about the newer versions?

6422505,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"i liked having this set, i still have not had a change to thoroughly watch everything on each disc, but with what i have seen of the 'exclusive' features, i find them to be very well done.

its a misnomer to call this collection ""complete"",it still lacks a few things here and there from previous releases.a lot of it is just previous releases pre-packaged. there was that issue with the fourth film's disc, but that got sorted out the following month.

for me it was simply a must have for the sake of having all of the series on bluray. each October i like to immerse myself in horror films.this set certainly compliments that tradition.

its not great but its not terrible.  i was able to purchase the set for around $60, so i  don't feel that i was ripped off. probably the only time we will have all the films from the different studios all in one set.",1426464000,,857,4.364779874213837

6422520,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I've been a huge Halloween fanatic ever since I was 8 years old, and I was ecstatic when Scream Factory announced they were releasing the entire series together in one box set. At first, I thought it was too good to be true because of rights issues, but they pulled off the impossible. The movies look great and crisp and clear all on blu-ray. They even released the long boot-legged Halloween 6 Producer's Cut which looks absolutely fantastic, if you've only seen it on a crummy boot-leg dvd. All the movies are in individual black blu-ray cases with the original posters as the cover art. There is even a special disc in the end along with Rob Zombie's Halloween II. Packed with interviews, making of, tv cut of the original, and much more. You may have audio sync issues with the Halloween 4 disc. If so, notify Scream Factory about that. My only problem is that this does not include the theatrical versions of Rob Zombie's Halloween films, just unrated. If you prefer the theatrical cuts, keep your dvds of those. These reviews WILL contain spoilers for those who've never seen the series.

Halloween- I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this film! In my opinion, HALLOWEEN is without a doubt, one of the best horror movies ever made! I love everything about it! I love that it takes place on HALLOWEEN! I love all the characters; especially Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie Strode. I love the mood and atmosphere! It has a classic horror story of a psychopath breaking out of Smith's Grove Sanitarium the night before HALLOWEEN and the next day, returns to Haddonfield, Illinois and goes on a rampage and stalks three friends named Laurie, Annie, and Lynda. Dr. Loomis tries to stop Michael from killing anyone, but it's already too late. Laurie is babysitting Tommy Doyle, and next door, Annie is babysitting Lindsey Wallace. Michael waits patiently to make his move. I love Michael's mask! It's freakin' awesome! Will Laurie survive the dark, bloody HALLOWEEN night? If you love classic horror, I highly recommend HALLOWEEN!!!!

Halloween II- I love this sequel! I just love how it takes place right after the original ended! Michael has been shot six times by Dr. Loomis, but he gets up and walks away! Loomis continues his hunt and Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. Michael stalks the hospital in search for Laurie. Loomis finds out something about Michael that he NEVER knew. I love the showdown at the ending with Michael, Loomis, and Laurie. HALLOWEEN II is a treat for any and all fans of HALLOWEEN, horror, and slashers! I highly recommend HALLOWEEN II!!!

Halloween III: Season of the Witch- Since 1998, I've been a big hard-core HALLOWEEN fan! I love HALLOWEEN III. People just hate it, because Michael Myers is not in it...SO WHAT!!! A little temporary change never hurts anyone. I love the storyline with the warlock named Cochran making HALLOWEEN masks out of Stonehenge. I love the ""Happy happy HALLOWEEN"" song and Cochran's speech to Dan about the Celts and how HALLOWEEN was 3,000 years ago. I really appreciate this ""sequel"" yes, I called it a sequel, because it's called HALLOWEEN III!!! Another part I love is what happens to Little Buddy Kupfer when he watches the commercial and his head turns into snakes and bugs. The last part I love is the ending, it keeps you in suspense. This classic film earns the right to be called ""HALLOWEEN III""

Although Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie Strode have been taken out, this is 100% really good HALLOWEEN material. It starts off with a man named Harry Grimbridge trying to run away from some men in business suits. In his hand, he's grasping on to a Silver Shamrock HALLOWEEN Pumpkin mask. Later, he passes out and taken to the hospital by the filling station attendant named Walter Jones. Later in the night, Harry is murdered by one of the business man. Dr. Daniel Challis wants to investigate why he was murdered. Dan has a bad relationship with his ex-wife, who is played by the actress that played Annie in original HALLOWEEN. Dan hardly spends any time with his kids. Dan and the murdered man's daughter; Ellie Grimbridge make a plan and go to Santa Mira where the Silver Shamrock company is. (For some reason, I love the scene at the bar when Dan is drinking beer and that silly cartoon is on, then the original Halloween plays.) Conal Cochran is the boss, and Dan finds out that Conal is a warlock who plans to use the popular masks as a way to kill all the children on HALLOWEEN. Dan must stop it from happening. This really is a classic in its own way. I highly recommend HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF THE WITCH!!!

Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers- This sequel returns to the basics of the Halloween series. Everybody cried that Michael was gone, so they brought him back. Six years after Dr. Challis stopped Cochran and the evil Silver Shamrock masks, we return to Michael Myers, who has been in a coma ever since the fire in the hospital. While being transferred, he overhears that Laurie Strode had a daughter named Jamie Lloyd, so he awakens and goes back to Haddonfield and tries to kill her. Hot on his trail is Dr. Loomis, who also survived the explosion in the hospital. Jamie has been adopted by the Carruthers family and must be protected by Rachel. On Halloween night, Jamie and Rachel are trapped inside the Sheriff's house with Michael locked in. This movie has some beautiful Autumn scenery. If you love the series, you'll definitely enjoy HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!

Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers- I love almost all the Halloween films, but this one goes a little downhill for me. One year after stabbing her foster mother, Jamie Lloyd has been taken to a children's hospital. Since Jamie touched Michael's hand, she exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her Uncle Michael. On Halloween, Michael returns to Haddonfield to finish what he started last year. Rachel, Tina, Mikey, Spitz, and Sammy become Michael's new targets at a Halloween party as he tries to find Jamie.  I love the scene when Michael is chasing Jamie, Billy, and Tina through the cornfields with the car! Donald Pleasence is back playing the awesome Dr. Loomis who tries to hunt Michael throughout the Halloween night at all costs. Later, Loomis takes Jamie to the Myers house. I love scenes of the police and S.W.A.T. team stakeout at Michael's house. That's pretty cool. Loomis tries to reason with Michael one last time before the showdown. Loomis uses Jamie as bait to trap Michael. When Loomis finally stops Michael, he is taken to the police station, so that the U.S. National Guard will take Michael to a maximum-security prison until he dies, but something bad happens. What happens? You'll just have to watch! If you love the Halloween series, maybe you'll love HALLOWEEN 5: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!

Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers- This is where things get weird. The 6th film in the franchise tries to explain why Michael is the way he is. He's being controlled by a cult who gives him the Thorn curse. (The Producer's Cut is a much better film if you want to make any sense out of it. The theatrical version is too watered down and difficult to understand at times) Tommy Doyle is back, and he fears for the people living in the Myers house, who happen to be related to the Strode family. When Jamie Lloyd is found dead and her newborn baby turns up, Dr. Loomis comes out of retirement to try to find and kill Michael for one final time. He teams up with Tommy and Kara Strode. Dr. Loomis is baffled when he comes face-to-face with the man who has been controlling Michael all these years. This film is a lot better than part 5. I highly recommend HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!

Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later- I remember being 8 years old and seeing it at the theater. 20 years after Michael tried to kill Laurie Strode, he soon decides to try again. She lives under the name of Keri Tate. She has a son named John. She works as a head mistress at a private boarding school in Northern California. She has a boyfriend. Soon, Michael tears her life up again. She soon decides to fight back and finish her brother off once and for all...until the sequel. If you love the  Halloween series, you'll love HALLOWEEN H20: TWENTY YEARS LATER!!!

Halloween Resurrection- As a hard-core Hallowee fan, I feel like I'm the only one who truly loves this awesome sequel! I love the plot, the setting, and the mood in the film! Michael finally finishes off his sister, Laurie Strode, which kinda sucked. One year has passed and Freddie Harris starts a new website called DangerTainment and six lucky people win a chance to be in it, and the location is Michael Myers' childhood home. I love that the house looks just like the original house. Sara, Rudy, Jen, Bill, Donna, and Jim are the winners, and they meet Freddie and Nora for their interviews. Meanwhile, across town, Myles 'Deckard' Barton is watching Sara do her interview, because he is interested in her and has been helping her with internet stuff. on Halloween, they all go to the Myers house, and broadcast live on the Internet for millions of people to watch. No one can leave until the show is over, so they are all locked in. Little do they know, Michael is back and doesn't like uninvited guests. At a college Halloween party, Myles 'Deckard' is watching the show, and when Michael shows up, Myles believes that the people are actually being killed, but no one else at the party does until Sara is the last one alive and calls Myles for help to tell her where Michael is at. Freddie finds Sara and realizes what is happening. Most people hate that Busta Rhymes karate-chops Michael, but I have no problem at all with it! Later, in the garage, Sara has been knocked on the ground with some heavy equipment on her, and Michael is coming to kill her, then Freddie knocks the door down, and says ""Trick or treat, motherfu#*er!"" to Michael because he thought he killed Freddie. If you love sequels, horror, the internet, and the Halloween series, you'll love HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION!!!

Rob Zombie's Halloween- I personally loved this remake! It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I saw this the first day it came out. I couldn't possibly wait another day. I loved the beginning showing Michael, his mom; Deborah, Judith, baby Laurie, and Deborah's boyfriend; Ronnie White. I loved how we meet Dr. Loomis. I love the scenes at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. I love how Michael breaks out. (NOT the unrated version of how he breaks out!) I love how Michael gets his clothes from Big Joe Grizzley. I love when they show Michael putting his infamous mask on and they play the Halloween music! I love it when Laurie finally meets Michael at the Wallace house, I loved it when Dr. Loomis tries to kill Michael. I especially loved the ending. To me, Rob Zombie's Halloween is just as good as John Carpenter's classic!  Halloween begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31st in the morning. Michael is 'playing' with his rat. We see how it is in his house with the white-trash Ronnie White, his mom and sister. During school, he gets in a fight and Dr. Loomis sees that he is at the early stage of becoming a psychopath. On Halloween night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on Halloween. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time? You gotta watch the movie to find out! If you love horror, remakes, and Rob Zombie's work, you'll love HALLOWEEN!!!

Rob Zombie's Halloween II- I had waited a long time for this movie, and it was definitely worth the wait! HALLOWEEN II was awesome! I loved every minute of it! I have been a fan of the HALLOWEEN series ever since I was eight years old, and this film was everything a Halloween fan would love and more! Michael Myers is back with a vengeance and he's more brutal and violent than ever! Rob Zombie did an awesome job at directing his newest masterpiece! This is the trippiest Halloween yet. I loved the amazing details of the dreams and hallucinations that Michael and Laurie both had. I love when Michael attacks at The Rabbit in Red Lounge. I love all the decorations and costumes at Haddonfield's 4th Annual Phantom Jam. I love the police standoff toward the end when Michael is holding Laurie hostage. Everybody did an amazing job! (I think I still prefer the theatrical version. In the unrated, Laurie is too bi-polar and makes us hate her. I love the original ending the best, too)

A year after the HALLOWEEN massacre, Laurie Strode lives with Leigh and Annie Brackett and is an absolute mess, does drugs, and slowly descending into madness. Dr. Loomis has written a new book and becomes more of a spoiled celebrity. Michael is still alive and sees images of his beautiful mother as a ghost, and the younger version of himself. Deborah tells Michael that he needs to kill Laurie so they will become a family again. When Laurie finds out the truth about who she really is, she doesn't care about anything anymore, so she heads off to the Phantom Jam. After partying with Harley and Mya, Michael comes after Laurie once again to have the ultimate family reunion, because family is forever. Will Laurie put an end to Michael's reign of terror once and for all? If you love the Halloween series, and Rob Zombie's directing style, I highly recommend HALLOWEEN II !!!

It was announced recently that Danny McBride and David Gordon Green are writing the next Halloween film and looking to be released in October 2018 along with John Carpenter as Executive Producer. I'm very excited about that, and I hope they do a great job. If you're a major big-time Halloween fan like me, I highly recommend HALLOWEEN: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION!!!",1423440000,5,14524,4.694270015698587

Bittersweet that it arrived and I needed to pay import charges into the UK.

6422540,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Awesome set!,1421193600,,12,5.5
6422541,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"(Note:  I know that a well-publicized issue with this boxed-set is an audio-glitch on the ""Halloween 4"" Blu-Ray disc, which causes a slight sync-issue for about 10 minutes of screentime.  I've watched this disc disc start-to-finish twice on two different Blu-Ray players, and neither time did I nor anyone else I was watching notice any such sync issue.  Audio fit the image perfectly.  I did notice an extremely quick graphical glitch, however, during the moment when the sync-issue is said to begin.  The video skips for about 1 frame.  But no audio issue.  And the video-glitch is so minor, it's barely noticeable.)

There isn't much to be said for this boxed-set that hasn't already been said.  It's a gorgeous-but-slightly-problematic release from Scream Factory (quickly becoming my favorite place to go for Blu-Ray releases as a horror fan) that compiled all (thus-far) 10 entries in the long-running ""Halloween"" franchise.

It includes:
-The original classic, available in both theatrical and extended editions.  (Extended featuring the added tv-version scenes)
-""Halloween II"" in both theatrical and TV editions.
-""Halloween III: Season of the Witch""
-""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers""
-""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers""
-""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" in both its original and elusive ""Producer's Cut"" editions.
-""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later""
-""Halloween: Resurrection"" (Which will probably be the only film in this release I never watch, for reasons obvious to any fan)
-The Unrated Cut of Rob Zombie's reboot ""Halloween""
-The Unrated Cut of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II""

Each film houses an assortment of special features, including commentary, interviews, making of content and more.  And it's nice to report that despite missing some bonus content from prior releases, this new boxed-set houses a great deal of new bonus content- so don't worry, this isn't just a cash-grab- the wealth of new material makes it worth buying for fans who may already own previous releases.

The biggest draw is of course the inclusion of the ""Halloween 6"" producer's cut in its first official release.  And while still a poor film overall with it's silly magic/cult-based storyline, it's definitely a big draw for long-time fans and collectors, and it's worth checking it at least once.  Especially as it feels like a much more organic, complete film than what we've settled with for the past 20 years, and is fun to see in all its remastered glory.

The packaging is where I almost took off a point.  The box housing the discs is gorgeous, but feels very light and cheap.  And in fact, mine received some pretty bad cosmetic damage just removing the outer-sheeting (which is meant to be removed) that is stuck on with with those small, allegedly-removable gel-gobs.  (Big part of the image on the box peeled right off.)  But I can't complain, because it's only a cosmetic flaw to an otherwise near-flawless set.

If you are looking for a great way to own these films on Blu-Ray, this is definitely the place to go.  For only about $100 (I got mine on sale for $70, however, so shop around), this is a great value for some great horror films!",1421107200,2,3167,5.024904214559387

6422554,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I will update this review as time allows and I can view the movies one by one.  I want to start by saying the first movie I watched was Halloween 4 due to the lip sync issues and if there seems to be an issue with any of the movies, this seems to be it as far as reviews go.  I had NO lip sync issues whatsoever when viewing Halloween 4 and this was through a Sony 7.2 receiver.  The movie played flawlessly and in fact, I went back after viewing the movie to the 46 minute mark that I read where the issue starts and again, no lip sync issue so maybe Shout and Anchor Bay included the new fixed version in my box set which was purchased Dec. 23. 2014.

As far as reviews for each of the movies, I will skip this altogether as if you are viewing this, you have either already seen the movies.  if not, there are plenty of reviews to choose from to get a wealth of information.  I will say that the box is a heavier cardboard box and it comes with a 40+ page color booklet.  The disc jackets are all black and printing labelling has the new Anchor Bay/Shout Logos on them.  They all look nice in the box.  Only down side would be if you have to replace a jacket and trying to find a matching black one could prove difficult or even impossible.

I am very happy with the presentation and the quality of the set overall.  The couple of discs I have viewed, Halloween 3 and 4, the clarity and sound are very good and seem cleaned up and restored very well.",1419638400,4,1452,4.059649122807017

6422561,5,B00KDU8HQQ,This is a great set for any halloween collection espically if your want them all on blu ray. The legendary producers cut is finally here and is restored unlike the bad bootleg copy floating over the Internet. There are Some great features here as well as a couple of interviews with Donald plesence. But this now you won't regret it.,1418515200,,333,4.566666666666666
6422562,5,B00KDU8HQQ,A beautiful set.,1418515200,,16,4.666666666666667
6422563,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Chances are anyone reading this knows the films themselves, which they do and do not like etc.  Really the main reason to get this set is all the extras now that the series has finally ended.  You get all the same extras as you would get on the DVDs, but not always in the same order.  For example the disc with Halloween 4 only has the trailer on it as an extra.  Then 4 and 5 has combined behind the scenes material for both movies and then the final bonus disc has archival and updated bonus materials for both movies.

For Halloween 1:
You get multiple commentary tracks on the movie.  The TV footage is included as a bonus but not included in the film itself.  However a version of the film with the added scenes in the movie is included on the final bonus disc.  The big additional features are the 1 hr Night She Came Home documentary which followed Jamie Lee Curtis to one of the conventions, which she agreed to do if the proceeds went to a children's hospital.  There is also a 1.5 hr featurette called ""A cut above"" which has archival and updated interviews with the cast and filmmakers and just generally discusses the influence of the movie.  The big takeaway from that is Carpenter never wanting to make the movie into a series, and he only did Halloween II because he did not make much money at all on the first one, and wanted a better deal from the second.  But after Halloween III bombed, which is the direction he wanted to take the series, he had nothing to do with it from there.  On disc 2 there is another version of the movie that has a commentary track with Hill, Carpenter and Curtis, but not with the three of them together having a conversation, you just get them talking with a voice cutting in identifying the speaker.  The commentary track on disc 1 with Carpenter and Curtis together is much better.

For Halloween II:
The big extra is a 40 min Nightmare isn't over feature that tells the story of the film, including updated cast interviews.  There are also deleted and alternate scenes, commentary tracks and the Horror's Hallowed Grounds feature showing the locations the film was shot in.

For Halloween III, there is a commentary track by the director Tommy Lee Wallace, where he tries to defend what they were making, and saying he really did not want it under the Halloween name.  There is also an episode of Horror's Hallowed Grounds in the bonus material.

Halloween 4 has just the trailer as a bonus.  This is also the disc that has the audio issues on one of the tracks.  I did not notice it and was looking for it.  I do see the glitch where it should start, but I think it may depend on which audio channel you are on, or if you are going through speakers because I could not notice it being out of sync just watching it through the regular audio channel coming through the TV.

Halloween 5:
This has the commentary track with Danielle Harris and Elle Cornell.  It also has some of the original behind the scenes material for 4 and 5, but nothing new.  All the new material (including Horror's Hallowed Grounds episodes for 4 and 5) are on the bonus disc at the end,

Halloween 6:
Probably has the biggest update of all of them.  Of course the long anticipated producer's cut is finally available in HD.  The movie is still pretty bad either way (which is sad because I think if they would have done it right, it had potential).  The best part of it is Donald Pleasence coming back to play Loomis one last time and is the first film for Paul Rudd.  There are a lot of extras including Jamie's story which has Danielle Harris talking about how she wanted to play the role and was ultimately replaced, and how she did not like what they ended up doing to the character.  There is also a feature called Cursed curse, which details all the problems they had making the movie, the fight between the producers and the studio, and admissions on many of the film makers part that the movie just did not work.  There is also a nice feature where Mariah O'Brien and J.C. Brandy (who took over the Jamie role) were talking about their experiences with the movie.

On Halloween H20:
There is a commentary track with the director and Jamie Lee Curtis talking about the film.  Updated making of, and behind the scenes material as well as footage from back in 1998.  Plus all the original bonus features.

On Halloween 8, and the two Rob Zombie films, only the original bonus features were included there.  Nothing new on any of those.

The final disc is the stand alone bonus disc with the rest of the Horror's Hallowed Grounds material, the version of Halloween with the TV footage blended in, Halloween 4 and 5 extras, stills, and assorted TV and radio shots.

All in all you get a ton of material.  The amount of bonus features far outpaces the amount of time the movies themselves take up.  If you are a fan of the series, and want all the bonus material it is definitely worth getting, even if you do not like some of the movies.  If you do not like going through all the extras, and don't care about watching some of the movies, then getting the individual movie discs are probably the better way to go.",1418428800,13,5140,4.425531914893617

I guess the producers will release a single Bluray/DVD version when they have seen that most hardcore fans have purchased this baby. Yeah, it's always a shame the ""real"" fans have to financially suffer the most. Overall, this set is ONLY for fans who can't wait for the release of the single H6 disc, and as for the rest, isn't it quite obvious that hardcore fans already have the remaining disks? Greedy tactics by Malek Akkad and I hope since they've already destroyed the series literaly with Halloween; Resurrection (I mean what a joke, right?) and they're not getting Rob Zombie back anymore for future reboot, sequels, they should go the ""X-men: Days of Future Past""/""Star Treck"" reboot route and return after the events at the end of Halloween H20 and forget/ignore (like they did with Jason Goes to Hell which ignored what the heck of an ending for the crapfest Friday 8 was) that Ressurection never existed or just say it was J.L.Curtis' bad pipe dream.

Curtis and you've got a absolute hit because the only really good Halloweens were the ones where she was in it, with a few exceptions with Donald Plesease (R.I.P.)",1415232000,4,1329,4.708154506437769

One or two are skimpy on the extra features, but they are some of the more ""not so good"" movies in the franchise anyways, so it didn't really matter to me. I do want to take a moment and say that Halloween 3 deserves a lot more love than it gets. For those of you that don't know, it has nothing to do with the other films. It is a stand-alone but it is good. Many people don't give it a chance because Michael Myers isn't in it, but I love it. The first 3 movies in the series are all good. 4, 5, and 6 (curse of MM) drop of for me though. I still like them (sometimes more than others), but they just don't do it for me like the first 3 do. The 2 Rob Zombie movies are okay as well. Anyways, this set is great. If you like the movies, just go ahead and get it. I think that you will be glad that you did!!

6422626,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"No need to review the movies here. This review is strictly for the Complete Collection Limited Deluxe Edition Blu-ray boxset.

The content: If you were someone who bought the 35th Anniversary bluray of H1 or the recent Scream Factory release of H2, then buying this boxset will offer a degree of redundancy. The same is true for anyone who already owned Rob Zombie's entries on bluray. H4 and H5 are ported directly from the DVD releases so nothing new is to be found on these discs. The true draw of this boxset (and this is what will tip you either into the buy or don't buy categories of fans) is the presence of the TV edition of H1 (not previously available in HD), the Producer's Cut of H6, and the new special features on H3 and H20.

In terms of special features, Scream Factory provides wonderful collections of archived behind the scenes footage and interviews as well as in-depth and candid discussions in contemporary interviews. Steve Miner and Jaime Lee Curtis provide new commentary for H20, shedding a lot of light on the making of the film. As someone who thinks highly of H20, I was always disappointed with the lack of special features. I found everything in this set worth watching. The retrospective feature for H3 was very candid, with everyone offering their open opinions about the film and how it was made.

The real draw for me was the inclusion of the Producer's Cut of H6. As a fan of the series, I spent years trolling the internet for deleted scenes and bootleg cuts of this version of the film. Having it reassembled and professionally mastered was a dream come true. While I'm not certain if it is a better version of the film, just having it allows fans to finally choose for themselves. Even better, the PC has its own special features that compare and contrast both versions of the film, as well as those versions of the script that never ended up in the either version. This is truly a gift for fans of the series.

The transfers:
Every movie is presented in 1080p HD. However, these are simply transfers and not remasters. The grain and dirt present in every other copy of these films are still present here. While it is less noticeable in the earlier films due to their old, grainy film, it is quite obvious in H20 or Resurrection. If this is something that bothers you, you might not be happy with these transfers. Personally, I think it maintains the authenticity of the film, firmly placing films in a pre-digital era. The video on 1,2, and 3 look the best to me. Sound is adequate, with a decent 5.1 digital presentation. Nothing to scream about, but all the movies sound good. The only problem I've had thus far is the sound is not in synch with the video on H4. That is bad, and it becomes worse the further into the film you get, magically fixing itself at about 1 hour in. Some reports online have claimed that it only lasts for a 10-minute stretch, but I could swear it went longer than that on mine. A replacement disc is imminent and Anchor Bay is currently working on it by all accounts. Once this is rectified, I couldn't have a single complaint about this box set's transfers.

The disappointments: There are a couple minor issues I have with this set. The first is why nothing was done to add to H4 and 5's presentations. I'm surprised that Scream Factory didn't at least make one retrospective for each. Next, I was confused as to why H1, 2 and 6 present all available versions of the films yet Rob Zombie's movies are only the director's cuts. Why not also include the theatrical cuts for the sake of completion? If you want to call something a complete set, you should include all versions of all films. That is a bit of an oversight on the part of Scream Factory and Anchor Bay. Again, these are minor issues and are more about my personal preferences than anything. Other fans will have other issues, I'm sure.

Frankly, I held off on buying this set because of the redundancy in H1 and 2's presentations, as well as the lack of new features for 4 and 5. However, the H6 discs and the new features on H20 were too much for me to resist. As I finished watching these films again, I remembered how much I loved them and exactly why I don't mind having bought them one more time. Some fans might want to wait a couple years for H4 to be fixed and the price to come down. I wouldn't recommend you wait too long. This boxset is worth having for any true fan of the series.",1414022400,14,4425,4.4635352286773795

If you have a multi-region or Region A (USA) player, you're ready to watch a fine set. These are all fine prints and have solid sound. I was NOT affected by the H4 dialogue-synch issue. For me, the high-point is the PRODUCER'S CUT of Halloween 6, a very different movie from the theatrical version, with a dark, supernatural plot, and a far more intriguing conclusion involving Donald Pleasence. I had a bootleg version for a couple of years which was poor quality, but this one is razor sharp. All the extras are terrific, great new documentaries and commentaries, and a couple of the movies were remastered with the assistance of Dean Cundey, the original DP.

All the transfers look and sound great.  The HALLOWEEN 6 PRODUCER'S CUT is an extraordinary TREAT.  The quality of it looks amazing and it's so great to see more Doctor Loomis in a more coherent version of the movie.  There is a great set of bonus features on here, especially the ""Horror's Hollowed Grounds"" episodes where host Sean Clark returns to most of the filming locations in many of the Halloween movies so we can see what they look like today.  It was also really cool to see the ""TV version"" of the original HALLOWEEN in HD (with the added scenes in really good looking SD).  Hats off the Scream Factory and Anchor Bay for putting together that version.  Overall, if you are a fan of this series, this BOX SET is a MUST have.  The only negative aspect of this set is that there is an audio sync issue in HALLOWEEN 4 that lasts about 10 minutes and is very frustrating.  Anchor Bay is offering a corrected replacement disc at this time, so look into that if you grab this awesome set! Enjoy!",1413849600,3,1176,4.453271028037383

6422646,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I just recently purchased this collection at Best Buy, at this point the price for this collection is going to be relatively similar no matter where you go to purchase it, between $95 - $100.  I had heard rumors that the 4th film had audio out of sync, I've watched it all the way through and I couldn't pin point any time where this happens.  There could very well be a batch of discs that were poorly encoded or something to make this happen.

I LOVED the pamphlet like book that was included which details the entire Halloween franchise from its start to present day.  The only films that I wish were not included in the collection were the Rob Zombie films.  It's already rumored that Halloween 3 is in pre-production, so that means there would be a hole in this collection then when that film is released.  I think they should have just included the first 8 films.  Since Rob Zombie's films essentially reboot the franchise.

In terms of the quality of the picture, all of these films had top notch appropriate transfers from original film to 1080 blu-ray.  Some of the films are better than others but you also have to remember a few things here.  This series jumped several times through multiple production companies, A number of these films didn't exactly have the highest budget and didn't have the greatest film equipment.  So if you're a ""purist"" you may not be 100% satisfied, but if you're just a big fan of the franchise you will be more than pleased with this collection.",1413158400,5,1487,4.573584905660377

I did purchase a copy of the Criterion version thinking that finally I would get to see the complete original version of Halloween.  I saw it in the theater when it was originally released. The version I saw then, I've never seen since, period. There were many additional scenes in that original theater showing. After taking off in the station wagon, he stopped and killed 2 telephone line workers and took their clothes; broke into his old home; then broke into a hardware store and stole weapons, and all this happened before Halloween morning in 'Haddenfield'. There is a short tie-in to the hardware store break-in still in the movie, Jamie's friend the sheriff's daughter says something about her dad investigating the break-in when they drive by the store. There were also scenes in the old house where he hid at times.  It was quite a movie in that version.  Wish they could bring it back.",1412899200,3,951,4.682634730538922

On behalf of Anchor Bay and Scream Factory, we want to thank everyone that has purchased the Halloween Complete Collection.  We hope you are enjoying it and all the work that went into bringing it to you, the fans. Unfortunately there is an audio sync issue with Halloween 4 that has always existed on that film with every release.  We attempted to fix one of the problems prior to this release but in doing so, it created sync issues elsewhere in the film, which has now come to light.  For the past two weeks we have been working to fix the problems that have arisen and we have been able to fix the sync issues at the 46 minute mark.  We will be issuing a replacement disc to anyone that has been affected.

If you were affected by a Halloween 4 sync issue and would like a replacement disc sent to you, please follow these instructions:

In order to receive a replacement with the first batch being sent, send an e-mail to ABEHalloween4@Starz.com no later than October 31, 2014 and include the following:

1) Proof of purchase (photo or scan of receipt or digital receipt from on-line retailer)
2) Your name
3) Mailing address

Your replacement disc will then be shipped to arrive no later than November 14, 2014.

6422659,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"Halloween fans have a huge reason to be celebrating. In what can only be referred to as a major miracle, nine different movie companies have come together to release the definitive box set for the most important franchise in the slasher genre. Halloween: The Complete Collection hits store shelves just in time to be binge-watched during its namesakes holiday season.

Halloween: The Complete Collection is an exhaustive assemblage of every film in the series and enough special features to keep any horror fan entertained for days. Not only are all ten of the entries in the franchise included, but there are alternate versions of a couple highlighted as well depending on which version of the collection you get.

The deluxe edition includes the long sought-after Producers Cut of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. This rare gem is available for the first time legally and features 43 minutes of footage not seen in theaters, which creates a completely different viewing experience than what audiences in 1995 received. An extended cut of John Carpenters original 1978 film made up of footage from the TV edition is found as well. The TV versions of both Halloween and Halloween II are also included.

The standard release comes with the theatrical cuts of the original eight movies and unrated directors cuts of Rob Zombies reboots. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers Producers Cut, the Halloween and Halloween II TV versions, and the extended Halloween aren't included in this edition. Its perfect for those who just want all the basic films in one neat package.

Halloween: The Complete Collection is filled with so much bonus material it would take a whole other article to describe them in detail. They include audio commentaries, deleted scenes, alternate endings, behind-the-scenes featurettes, new and vintage cast and crew interviews, TV and radio spots, theatrical trailers, and more. Horrors Hallowed Grounds takes audiences back to the filming locations of Halloween II and Halloween III: Season of the Witch.

I don't know if theres really any point for me to even include a breakdown of the ratings for the Halloween movies, but here it is for what its worth. Each one has its own measure of violence, bloody images, profanity, nudity, and adult situations. Theyre all an interesting example of where the slasher genre was at the time they were made. 1978s Halloween is a study in suspense which shows very little onscreen gore. Move ahead to 1989s Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers and more bloodshed is seen. Rob Zombies versions of Michael Myers are even more graphic in every way to fit in with what genre fans expect in the 2000s.

Its safe to say that Halloween: The Complete Collections high-definition audio and video transfers for each film beats any previous standard DVD releases. Most have been available on Blu-ray before, but having them all together in one set is where the excitement comes in. They all look and sound great based on the level of restoration they were given.

John Carpenters Halloween and its sequels deserve to be celebrated because of their impact on the modern slasher and horror genres. Halloween: The Complete Collection helps to remind older audiences of this and educate newer viewers on where movies like Saw, Hatchet, and other less potent reboots and remakes of classics come from. Its a historical piece celebrating the many faces and eras of the Boogeyman and how hes stayed the iconic face of terror for over 35 years.",1412553600,5,3496,5.006884681583477
6422660,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Here is the great thing about this set.  It's a one stop shop for all the films.  Which has never been given to the fans before and for that, I'm thankful.  BUT... Halloween 4 has syncing issues.  That should have been fixed and I am surprised that Shout Factory didn't get on this from the original re-release blu-ray.  It's a bit of a bummer to know, if you want that particular film to be perfect, you'll have to wait for another release.
Other than that, the interviews are excellent, the remastering on these discs (with the exception of H4) is fantastic.  Halloween (1978) looks like it was shot yesterday.  Amazing job.  The sound on all the films is pretty intense as well.  If you have the right set-up in your home, you will enjoy this complete set!",1412467200,4,759,4.481751824817518

6422662,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"Edit: The audio sync has been fixed, sort of. Make sure you're getting a set that doesn't have the defect. Anchor Bay sent out blu rays with the fixed audio to everyone who contacted them about the problem. So all in all, a pretty complete set, besides the lack of Rob Zombie's theatrical films. (The first RZ Halloween is much better without the brutal rape scene in the Dir. Cut).

This is one of the most complete horror sets available, and both Anchor Bay and Scream Factory deserve credit for bringing all of this together, but you can't get past the horrible audio sync issue present on the Halloween 4 blu. About halfway through the film there is a small glitch and audio gets unsynced for 10-20 minutes, making the film practically unwatchable. If it weren't for this defect, I'd give the set a 4 or 5 star rating. I'll likely change my rating if the company does something to remedy the problem.",1412467200,12,904,4.54601226993865
6422663,2,B00KDU8HQQ,"I will start it off with the halloween 4 sync issues. About half way through the movie it goes completely out of sync. (Id say about a full second behind, which doesnt sound like much but  It is!) Anchor bay is aware of the problem, but as of now they refuse to correct it.

Next up is halloween h20. The last blu ray release of this was a disaster. This one is a far improvement, but still lacks alot. (Mainly the picture). The colors are very off. & picture looks soft most of the film. But on the plus side the aspect ratio is fixed (2.35:1) & the audio is back to dts 5.1.

Next issue is rob zombies halloweens. They are both the unrated versions. Would have been nice to get the theatrical versions also. (As I enjoy the theatrical version of his first halloween alot more ). The region codes are also mislabeled.  (But thats really no big deal).

Also the set itself is very confusing of what is on which disc. (The book is no help either) also the box looks a little thrown together/cheaply made.

A few other quick notes, halloween 6. Producers cut (Why most of us bought this box to begin with) looks & sounds fantastic. But I must warn the die hards, it is not the bootleg thats been floating around for years. They still left alot out comparing it to that.

Finally in closing, should you purchase this set?? Id say if halloween 4 is not fixed, then no!  Must of us have double dipped on these movies numerous times & for anchor bay to turn their backs on us, the consumers is wrong. I think we deserve a little more respect.",1412467200,24,1536,4.272413793103448
6422664,4,B00KDU8HQQ,I've waited a long time for this set refusing to buy any halloween movie until a box set comes out. Finally that day has come and I'm happy to say I'm not disappointed. The movies look and sound superb on bluray and I like the fact that you get old and brand new special features. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five was because I thought the packaging was a little lack luster. I like the fact that each movie comes in its own case and art work but the putter box or sleave rather was a little blah. The recent friday the 13th set came with uv copy of each movie a nice tin box set and a patch. I just thought we should get some sort of gimmick thing or digital copy since we've waited so long for this set. What really matters is the movies and special features and this set does not disappoint in any way. As always great job by amazon on getting my product here on time and undamaged and since the price dropped the day it was released from when I preordered it they credited me the difference so hats off to amazon.,1412380800,2,1034,4.098522167487685
6422665,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"As far as collections go, I felt this one was very well produced and geared toward true fans of the legend and the horror films of yesteryear. I'm not someone who complains over the bonus features, and I was impressed by the range of extras here. The quality of the set is as solid as other collections I've purchased and it looks like they went a step further by toning down the ""bright"" blue cases associated with BluRay. I'm impressed with the collection thus far, and would recommend this to fans of Halloween. Casual collectors probably wouldn't want to spend so much; though there's plenty to keep a person entertained.",1412380800,3,625,4.6909090909090905

6422667,3,B00KDU8HQQ,"A nice set overall, but not quite complete.  It would have been nice if Zombie's theatrical cuts and the ""25 Years Of Terror"" documentary had been included.  Also, why not give us the TRUE TV version of the original Halloween that accidentally got released on VHS in the 80's, complete with censored language and gore?  Or the TV version of Halloween III?  But I digress.

The set has a few technical problems.  Rob Zombie's Halloween Disc 1 sports a Region B stamp, even though it's a Region A pressing.  The worst problem is with Halloween 4.  The out-of-sync audio problem on the Halloween 4 disc is very distracting, and lasts about 15 minutes. I checked my previously purchased single disc blu-ray release of Halloween 4 and the problem either doesn't exist, or isn't bad enough to be noticeable. Given that, and the fact that the box set version of the disc, for some reason, doesn't include the Halloween 4/5 panel discussion from the previous release, I simply swapped the Halloween 4 disc out and replaced it with the stand-alone blu-ray.  Hopefully, Anchor Bay will do the right thing and offer replacement discs.

As for special features, it seems like the features from the Halloween 4&5 Divimax DVDs that weren't included with the original blu-ray releases are back (as bonus features on disc 15), with the exception of Alan B.McElroy's commentary from part 4 and the Danielle Harris / Ellie Cornell intro from part 5. It's nice to see the Halloween Unmasked 2000 documentary from that year's Halloween DVD release reappear finally (also on disc 15).  And let's talk the Halloween 6 Producer's cut. Finally, after 19 years, the fans get to see it in all its glory.  And it looks amazing!  It's almost a completely different movie than the theatrical cut, and the extra Donald Pleasance screen time is quite welcome.  The folks who put this set together must have known this elusive version of Halloween 6 would be the major draw, because there are TONS of brand-new special features on this disc as well!

So, overall a good set to binge watch in October. Just keep that Halloween 4 blu-ray you were about to get rid of.",1412294400,13,2133,4.758152173913044

6422671,1,B00KDU8HQQ,"I was anxiously looking forward to watching the entire run of Halloween movies this October, but was smart enough to start checking the discs, and discs 2 & 15 (the bonus disc) were both defective.  Neither would play on my player at ALL.  They simply wouldn't load.  So I requested an exchange via Amazon, thinking I could just get discs 2 & 15 from the new set and replace them in my original copy, and guess what?  Both discs are defective in the new set as well, with the exact same behavior.  All of the others play fine.

Am I the only one having this issue?  Strange that nobody else has complained about this yet.  Unless it's just a problem with my player, so maybe I should test it on a friend's BluRay player.

This, along with the sound sync issues on H4, and it would appear that there are some serious quality control issues with this set, so guess I will most likely be returning both defective sets for a full refund and keeping my Scream Factory editions of parts 2 & 3, and everything else I already owned.

Too bad, because this otherwise appeared to be a fantastic set, but it's useless to me if I can't even watch everything.  Months of excitement and anticipation just ended with a dull thud...  Oh well, at least I'll be saving a $100.",1412208000,21,1258,4.375

Scream Factory was also involved in this set and issued the following statement on their Facebook Page.

""We investigated the audio issue with Anchor Bay today. Every disc in the set went through a stringent quality control process. The slight audio off-sync during the isolated section of Halloween 4 has apparently been that way on prior releases. There will be no replacement program in place for this disc.

We apologize for the less-than-100%-perfect audio presentation of H4. Unfortunately, when dealing with films where the source materials are almost 30 years old it can sometimes be a challenge to bring a film up to the best of everyone's satisfaction.

6422687,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"For all of us DIE-Hard Halloween Movie fans, most of us know what these movies are about, so there is no reason to review these movies again, I would like to concentrate on the set itself and my review of I was hoping for and what we actually got. We are never going to happy with everything we get on the Halloween Movies Blu Ray/DVD Set. As DIE-Hard Fans, we will always find ways to complain, that is just the nature of being a die hard fan of something.

That being said, no one ever thought this set would happen, lone a less the ""Producers Cut"" of H6. with several companies involved wanting there cut, but not wanting to shell out money.  Thanks to Shout Factory the process happened,for me I already had H1,H2 (original) and H3 and H4 Blu Ray editions (35th and Recent Shout Factory editions) So I guess I bought it for the additional documentaries ,Commentary and H6 P/ cut.  After my set arrived it seemed there were things that I was real happy about and things I was disappointed about, and things that would've been better for the set.

""My Overall Review including like and dislikes about the set  ""(Only My Opinion)""

H3, says 5.1 DTS HD master audio, looking on the back of the case, but it is still the same 2.0 DTS Mono version.

Why do we need both versions of H1 35th and previous Blu ray.  if the 35th is the ultimate edition, than that's all we need.  why not just add all the bonus content from both editions to a 2nd disc ""A Cut Above The Rest"" and ""Unmasked 2000"" ETC., then adding to the 2nd disc the extended edition with additional scenes (They could've re mastered those TV scenes at least to 720P if not to 1080p and give us the complete extended cut with the best audio and video.  They know that's what all the fans are wanting.

Sync problems with 4, I myself am playing this on a Oppo-BDP-95 at 24 Frames and have no issues.  but those that do, it is called QC before you sell something.  But I also read on Bluray.com forum someone said they got a reply from Anchor Bay and said there has always been sync problems??? Nice Reply from someone who takes your dollars and says too bad I don't care.

It seems every movie should have there stand alone bonus features with the actual movie, It seems an additional disc of features allows for higher price and reason for us to buy it again and again.  I think the only way some of the other companies would allow for this set, if they did not have to put a new discs together and use there old stock which gives them more profit and no expenses.  It would've been great if each movie was a 2 disc set 1 for the movie for highest bit rate for A/V and 2nd disc all bonus features previous editions and new documentaries.

H6 Producers Cut, should've had a standalone case and the theatrical edition could've been put in that case along with the additional bonus features.  I can say it was a nice upgrade from Echo Bridge editions of, H20 and H6 TC.  so props for that, but since everyone was waiting for the H6 PC, that is something that should've been given the delux treatment right down to case and artwork.

Some have felt the unrated cuts of Rob Zombies should've included the theatrical editions and there is TV versions of H3 and H6 and H20.  The Zombie cuts I don't feel they even should've been included in this set.  In my opinion those were terrible movies that put the series in a poor light,  copying lines and some scenes from the original,  all the crude language sitting around the table opening scene, just made it terrible, The other TV versions would've been nice, but they would've been 4x3 or terrible prints like the TV version we got of H2.  4x3 no remastering and poor audio, since none of the other companies wanted to spend a dime, just profit.  Considering they would not even create new discs, but just use old stock of H4,H5,H6 TC and H20 or not add the new bonus documentaries to the original movie it goes with.

In closing we may never get all the additional stuff we want, but I really appreciated the new insights to H20 and H4 and H5 and how the creation process went and the Mask problems and the score.  It makes you enjoy the movie more than you thought just by the honesty you got on the process and the difficulties in making some of these movies.  It would've been great if John Carpenter had gotten the rights to do H7, John probaly would've ended the series and or make it a viable series again and maybe take the series in a new direction and we never would've had H8 with Buster Rymes...  All in all there were things that made this set awesome and things we as DIE-Hard fans will never be happy with, that's what makes us fans.  Just think with 4K coming around the corner we will probably get a 40th H1 edition in 4K and maybe a H2 in 4K.  As long as there is money to be made this will not be the last edition of Halloween Movies to come out on Blu ray or 4K or what ever format is due down the road.  I am sure there will be some that may disagree with my review, I am open for discussion...Hope you have a great time watching theses movies now and beyond.

6422691,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars simply because of the TV Version of Halloween 1978.  The TV Version of Halloween 1978 is located on disc 15 instead of being within the Halloween Blu Ray case like the rest of the specials editions, it is located in the Rob Zombie's Halloween II box on the right side saying Halloween The Complete Collection Bonus Disc.  I watched the TV Version and it clearly states on the screen that all TV Inserted Scenes are in standard DVD definition but my problem is in the first of the TV scenes after Michael kills his sister the next scene is supposed to start out saying ""Smith Grove Sanitarium May 1973"" but in this cut it starts immediately with Dr. Loomis standing before the review board and Michael has aged 10 years.
  I read about a bunch of people having sync problems with Halloween 4, I watched my disc on my PS4 and it ran fine, I skipped ahead to various points in the movie from the middle to the final scene and their voices were matched to their mouths.  Some people were having sync problems after 45 minutes into the movie.
  The second reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the outer box, it looks like someone just slapped a sticker all round the box and it is uneven at points and looks cheap.  I think with this being a complete collection of Halloween movies including some Alternate Version it should have had a better box, maybe they should have used a laser printer instead of stickers.  They can't really call it a complete collection because they are still TV Versions and Different Versions of Halloween II The Ultimate Cut, Halloween III TV Cut, Halloween H20 the work print version called Halloween 7: The Revenge of Laurie Strode"" and Work print versions of Halloween: Resurrection called ""Halloween 8: The Homecoming: Evil Comes Home""
  I am happy however than they have finally brought all the Halloween films together for one big box set for the first time ever, before you were always missing Halloween II, Halloween H20 and Halloween Resurrection in the past since Dimension films owned those films.  I am and forever shall be a huge fan of Halloween so this set is perfect for a fan who finally wants all the films in on big box set.

I played Halloween 4 in my Sony Blu Ray player it has sync the problem between 45 minutes and 57 minutes only, before and after played perfect.  So if you can live with 12 minutes of the film being out of sync then you're okay.",1411948800,14,2454,4.458612975391499

For Example, a feature that was included on the ""25 Years of Terror"" DVD was the  Halloween 5: On the Set, this feature is included in the bonus disc with the 15 Disc Collection. Another example is that ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds is also included. Every documentary and feature that was included in the ""25 Years of Terror""  DVD is included in this set, it was just broken up to different discs. This set is all around amazing!

6422704,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"It's nice to finally have the entire Halloween collection in one set, but it's not without its flaws.  First, the Halloween 4 disc has a defect in it at about the half way mark.  At a certain part in the film you will see a slight ""glitch"" when Rachel is hopping a fence, after that part you will notice the audio goes slightly out of sync for about 20 minutes.  This defect is present on the deluxe 15 disc edition, as well as the 10 disc edition.  I have read online that Anchor Bay is aware of this, but there is no word yet on how they will handle this.  Also, you will notice that the Rob Zombie version of Halloween has a region B pressing.  Now, I haven't checked this disc yet, because I'm not a fan of this film, so I can't report if the disc works.  Again, reports online state that Anchor Bay claims it's just a printing problem, and NOT a real region B disc.  And lastly, the big selling point of Halloween 6 The Producer's Cut being available for the first time...I have to be honest, it didn't make much of a difference at all.  The theatrical version of Halloween 6 was a mess, and the producer's cut is not much better.  Yes, the producer's cut explains more about the plot, but at the same time it makes the plot more ridiculous.  The theatrical version stays closer to a true slasher flick, while the producer's cut expands into a supernatural toned slasher with an ending that will make fans of Donald Pleasence character shake their head in disbelief.  The 15 disc deluxe set comes with 10 individual black Blu-ray cases, along with a 42 page booklet housed in a hard box.  The set is worth it for all the special features and to have every film in the series, just be aware of the audio sync problem.

*Those looking for just the films (minus the Halloween 6 Producer's Cut) in a space saving format, check out the 10 disc set.  This set has 2 (slightly larger than normal) Blu/ray cases (each holding 5 discs) housed in a slipcover.

Also the 2 discs of Halloween are the same 2 as in the collector's edition of this title so the 2nd disc is still a DVD with the TV version. I found a cool website where you can check out what these double dips have on them but I don't think I am allowed to list it here but you can search for dvd double dips and find it. Next time something like this comes out I will check there before buying (ESPECIALLY for Halloween since it has been release SO MANY TIMES on DVD/Bluray).

Also missing is Universals Terror in the Aisles documentary hosted by Donald Pleasence  from their 30th anniversary blu ray release, so again you might want to save that disc as well. Otherwise this is a great set and a great addition to your horror collection. Most of the missing documentaries and featurettes won't be missed by new collectors but for a completist and long time video collector it doesn't help free shelf space or put everything under one roof but very very close.",1411776000,2,1224,4.538461538461538

6422709,1,B00KDU8HQQ,This box set is horrible what a disgrace by ANCHOR BAY!!!A nice complete set is the recently released Friday The 13th set and it was cheaper. This set is a joke it looks like junk if u r a Halloween fan just take the individual Halloween blurays you probably already own and put them in their case and all in a plastic box and save yourself the ridiculous price of over $100. The discs even feel so thin to me unlike normal Blu-ray Discs.i think the set itself should have been a lot better  considering the Halloween Franchise is known by all and loved by a lot of Life long fans  so it shouldn't have been just about making as much money as possible,1411689600,9,651,4.241935483870968

Each is in its own case (good call on them being in black cases)...but I feel it could of been awesome. Oh, the Bonus Disc is randomly thrown in the last case ""Halloween II"" (Zombie) , that could of been in its own case...kinda comes off as ""oh crap, where do we put this?? This looks OK.""

The inclusion of The long sought after Halloween 666 Producers Cut (which in my opinion is better than the original cut) is enough of a reason for any fan to pledge their money.

Money well spent and this years Halloween will be spent marathoning every last kill committed by legend that is Michael Myers.

6422716,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"Right off the bat I'll just say this: You Can't Please Everyone.

There are Several Omissions that people will complain about: Halloween 2 Television Cut not being in HD (<this one being my biggest complaint), The Alternate Opening to H5, The Workprint Deleted Scenes of Resurrection (know on Bootleg as Homecoming), the theatrical cuts of both Rob Zombie's Halloween's and of course the Unreleased Footage Billy Kirkus discovered a few years ago that Anchor Bay/Shout Factory think isn't worth his asking price for.

All of these are understandable complaints, except fom the Billy Kirkus one. As far as my research has gone he is asking for a hefty sum for the footage he bought, which to us as fans seems reasonable but to Malek Akkad, Anchor Bay and Shout Factory his demands seem unreasonable. Maybe we will get to see it eventually somewhere down the line but I won't hold my breathe. If we don't see it by the 40th Anniversary we probably won't ever see it.  Besides how often do you actually get every single piece of Behind The Scenes stuff released? We're lucky we've gotten what we have plus this Box Set alone considering the rivalries between the many studios involved.

As for the rest of the box set, bar my opening complaints; overall this is an amazing box set with tons of New Bonus Features never before seen. This is a must have for any Halloween fan, even if some of these films are double or triple dipping.

6422723,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I've been a Halloween fan every since my grandmother let me watch the first three movies (with commercials) when I was either seven or eight-years-old. In my teens I bought all the films on VHS and I upgraded to the DVDs when I was in my twenty's. I just turned 33 this month, so I pre-ordered the Halloween: The Complete Collection: 15-Disc Deluxe Edition as a late birthday for myself. I've been wanting to update my DVDs to Blu-rays for quite some time. I almost bought last year's 35th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray, but I'm glad that I never did buy it before The Complete Collection was announced, as this way I'm only paid $11 per movie. The set comes with a neat 43 page booklet, giving a brief history of each movie.

Of course the main attraction in the set is the long-awaited release of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers  The Producer's Cut, which was the first disc that I watched when I received the set yesterday afternoon. I saw a bad bootleg version of it years ago, so I'm very impressed by the picture quality and the sound on the Blu-ray. There are plenty of extras on this disc as well; I especially liked The Cursed Curse featurette and the Jamie's Story featurette.

I'm not going to go into every new feature in this set, as there are already plenty of early reviews/posts on here that details everything that is included. I know that some fans don't care for the Rob Zombie films, but I do wish that the original theatrical versions were included with the unrated ones. The extra bonus disc that comes exclusively with this set is located in the Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 case, which features the TV-cut of the original Halloween, as well as a bunch of new extras.

Overall, I love the Halloween: The Complete Collection: 15-Disc Deluxe Edition and I recommend it to fans that don't already own the films on Blu-ray. It is definitely a great late birthday present!",1411516800,3,1890,4.5828402366863905
6422724,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"You couldn't have made a Halloween fan any happier!!!  Thanks Anchor Bay, Shout!, Dimension/Weinstein's for showing other companies the impossible can be possible!!!  Sure there are a few things i could nit-pic about not being on this ""complete"" set, but you can tell that the people who put this together threw in everything they possibly could, and put a lot of love, sweat, blood, and tears into this set.  I hope this is the last time I have to buy Halloween! (I have bought the 1978 film no less than 6 times now) Finally the most anticipated cut of a film since the Donner version of ""Superman II"" probably, the Producer's Cut of Halloween 6 is here, and it looks amazing.  As do we finally get the extended version of the first film with a really nice 5.1 sound mix (was mono on DVD) and even though the added scenes are in standard definition, no one would have probably even noticed hadn't it been pointed out.  Only major downfalls of this set are petty, no reversible cover for Shout!'s ""Halloween II & III"".  No deleted scenes for ""H20"" (a muddy looking rough-cut featuring many is floating around out there), and of course no theatrical cut of the Rob Zombie films (which many people agree that both films work better in the theatrical cuts)-still minor infractions on what is now the ""Holy Grail"" of horror franchise sets.  Considering almost all the classic horror franchises have gotten box set treatment, the treatment pails in comparison to this comprehensive-nearly impossible to put together set.  A must for any Halloween or film fan, a very nice nail in the coffin of my days of spending any more money on this franchise! Thanks to all the companies and individuals involved in this labor of love!",1411516800,2,1719,4.706666666666667
6422725,4,B00KDU8HQQ,I think that this set is awesome and if you're a fan of the Halloween movies you will definitely want to own this. It has a TON of special features and the alternate versions of movies are great I do have one issue with this set however. Both of Rob Zombie's Halloween movies are Unrated versions ONLY so for anyone who prefers the theatrical versions of his films or just wants them both to make a more complete collection then you'll be disappointed. I personally like the unrated version of Rob Zombie's first Halloween a lot but the Unrated version of the second one annoys me to no end because the unrated version of Halloween 2 has an alternate ending where Micheal talks and I HATE that SO much! It doesn't even offer the original ending as a special feature in the deleted/alternate scenes selection. If it had included BOTH versions of Rob Zombie's films I would have loved this because it would actually be a complete collection. It's still a great set though and the special features and alternate versions of the other movies are definitely worth it.,1411516800,,1062,4.624338624338624
6422726,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"This is going to be a long review.  After all, there are 10 movies in this set with two of them having two different versions.  All-in-all, this is the box set for Halloween fans to own.  It comes with every Halloween movie along with tons of extra, some released for the first time ever.  The video quality for each movie is top notch though they haven't been remastered from the stand-alone releases.  Halloween is the same as the 35th anniversary release, the sequels are the same as their stand-alone releases, and the Rob Zombie movies are the same as when they were first released.  So the studios didn't go back to remaster these but I don't think they really needed to.  The 35th anniversary release of Halloween is about the best it will ever look on Blu-ray, Halloween II looked good originally and still does, Halloween III also looks good, etc.  About the only standout in terms of bad picture quality is Halloween: Resurrection.  There are some instances when it looks great like a proper Blu-ray release should and then it goes back to DVD quality levels.  It's all due to the fluctuation in sharpness and black levels, the colors are also pretty drab except for a few scenes.  The producer's cut of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers looks surprisingly good as this is the first time it has ever been released on home video.  It has some softer scenes but overall, I thought it looked better than the theatrical cut.

The audio in each movie is about as good as it will ever be at this point.  Each movie features a lossless multi-channel soundtrack but most movies are front heavy featuring dialogue and some L-R speaker use.  The rear channels rarely get used in the older movies.  Oddly enough, the Rob Zombie movies use the surround sound the best but that's likely due to those being more modern while the other Halloween movies were released in a time when surround sound didn't exist.

It all comes down to the movies though and here are my thoughts (on a horror scale):

Halloween - This is still the best of the bunch and it has aged gracefully.  It is the quintessential Halloween movie that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime.  It has a nice pace, the perfect atmosphere, and a classic soundtrack. The TV cut of this movie is interesting.  All they did was splice in scenes from the TV cut with the 35th anniversary master.  They didn't remaster them though so those scenes stick out like a sore thumb.  I don't suggest watching the TV cut explicitly but some of the added scenes are interesting.  You can find time markers for those online so you can easily fast forward to them since they are worth watching.  5/5

Halloween II - This one has never been my favorite or even at the top of my list.  It's essentially the same as the first movie but takes place in a hospital right after the events of the first movie.  The pacing is slow, the atmosphere is lost, and the soundtrack isn't  nearly as good.  There's nothing new here on than some creative death scenes. 3/5

Halloween III - A lot of people complain about the lack of Michael Myers in this movie but I think that actually adds life to this movie.  It tells a completely different story that is a sci-fi/horror blend with elements of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers sprinkled throughout.  I guess I can see why people hate on this movie but really, it's one of my favorites.  It has a stellar soundtrack, pacing that seems about right, and the premise is interesting and entertaining.  4/5

Halloween 4 - I've always liked this one.  It's not perfect but it's not terrible either.  The return of Michael Myers is nice and Danielle Harris does a fine job acting, even for a kid.  It has a nice atmosphere that just feels like Halloween particularly with the opening scene.  There are some pacing issues and the overall plot is pretty much the same as the first two movies (characters trapped in a place, Michael Myers tries to kill them).  The ending is great though and comes out of nowhere. 4/5

Halloween 5 - The great ending in the previous movie is pretty much trashed here.  It's really sad that the franchise had to continue with the tired premise as three other Halloween movies.  Yet again Michael Myers comes back to finish killing off his family.  It's not new, it's not original, and the setup at the end of Halloween 4 is pretty much pushed to the side.  This would have been a much better movie had they continued where Halloween 4 left off instead of recycling the same thing again.  There are a bunch of boring parts and this time, Danielle Harris's character is extremely annoying.  2/5

Halloween 6 - The theatrical version of this movie is pretty bad and the attempted explanation of Michael Myers is rather silly.  The acting is blah and it's sad that this is Donald Pleasence's last appearance in a Halloween movie. 1/5

Halloween 6 - The producer's cut is much improved over the theatrical release.  It features more of Donald Pleasence, improves upon the pacing, and features clips with better acting.  The whole explanation behind Michael Myers is still there but many scenes feature different dialogue and end better.  This one is worth watching and the only version of Halloween 6 worthy of the Halloween label.  As I said earlier, the video quality is also better than the theatrical version.  3/5

Halloween 7 (H20) - This is an interesting concept that ignores all the previous entries except the first two movies.  Michael Myers returns, and not in some witchcraft way, as does Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode.  The pacing is a little slow, the rest of the cast is just OK, but it's a nice send-off to the first two Halloween movies.  This should have been the ending to the series, the final battle between Michael and Laurie. 3/5

Halloween 8 (Resurrection) - Oh boy, this movie is messy.  Jamie Lee Curtis might be on the front of the box but she's in it for all of 5 minutes, Michael Myers's mask looks hideous, the cast can't act their way out of a paper bag, and the premise is dumb.  Busta Ryhmes should have never been in this movie and neither should Tyra Banks, they are the worst offenders in this movie.  The end battle is dumb and there are absolutely no redeeming qualities here.  Watch this once just to complete the series and never watch it again.  This is a sad ending to the franchise that had a great start.  1/5

Rob Zombie's Halloween (Director's Cut) - A bunch of people hated on this movie.  I get it.  It's a slow film that takes an hour to explain Michael Myers's back story and it has some bad characters.  The escape scene with Michael is one of the worst scenes ever, it's just pointless and idiotic.  I liked the rest of the movie though.  I appreciated Zombie giving depth to a character that had none outside of what they tried to attach in Halloween 6.  The kill scenes are great, Danielle Harris makes a return (though not the same character) and her acting is decent, Scout Taylor-Compton does an alright job as Laurie Strode, and the soundtrack is great.  I wasn't the biggest fan of Malcolm McDowell but it's hard to replace the image of Dr. Sam Loomis with anyone but Donald Pleasence.  I do enjoy the theatrical cut of this movie a lot more mainly because it features a different escape scene.  However, that is not in this box set and it was never released on Blu-ray in the U.S.  You either have to order it from Canada or find the DVD release somewhere.  It's a shame really as I give the theatrical version a solid 4/5, this one gets a 3.5/5.  The escape scene really feels out of place and takes you out of the movie. 3.5/5

Rob Zombie's Halloween II (Director's Cut) - Like the previous Halloween film from Zombie, this one is available only as the Director's Cut on Blu-ray.  That's OK this time around as it's better than the theatrical release.  The cinematography has improved in this movie as there are some really great images.  That's about all the praise this film deserves though.  It's a mess of a plot, all of the characters have turned into white trash, Michael doesn't wear his mask the majority of this movie (I guess I'm OK with that), the pacing is extremely slow, and the movie is way too long.  The imagery is great, really.  It's worth watching just to see the scenes that take place inside of Myers's mind.  That being said, it's easily one of the worst Halloween movies ever.  Still better than Resurrection (any movie without Busta Ryhmes is better) but not by much.  2/5

That sums it up.  There are far too many special features for each movie to list and I haven't watched them all yet.  There are a bunch of ""making of"" features for Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween III, Curse, the Zombie films, and others.  This box set comes with an exclusive disc (in the case for Zombie's Halloween II, I guess to make it better) that contains all sorts of special features that I haven't even scratched the surface of.

People who already have some of these movies on Blu-ray may want to hold off on a price drop.  I splurged despite owning the 35th Anniversary version of Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween H20 and Resurrection (it was a dual release for $5 at Walmart), and both Rob Zombie movies.  That's over half of the box set but the versions of Halloween II, H20, and Resurrection were the old bare bones releases.  I put all 6 movies up on Craiglist for $40 and sold them to help subsidize the cost of this box set.

All-in-all, I give the entire release 4/5.  The bonus features are great for fans, the producer's cut of Curse is much better than the original release, and it's a nice box featuring every movie ever.  It would benefit from the theatrical release of Zombie's Halloween but that's OK since it was never released on Blu-ray in the U.S.",1411516800,3,9759,4.554341575618172
6422727,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Amazing! A must buy for die hard fans. 15 discs of pure horrifying nirvana.,1411516800,2,75,4.428571428571429
6422728,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I have been a fan of the ""Halloween"" Franchise for years.  I made a comment in my review for the ""Fiday The 13th"" Series that all they needed to do was put the Halloween series & the Hellraiser series into complete sets.  Well, they got half of that wish true, putting the entire Halloween Series into one set (Actually 2 sets, the regular 10 disc & a limited edition 15 disc sets).
  I purchased the Limited Edition 15 disc edition.  I got home from work and I there it was!  I looked through it and I love it!  Although I had kind of hoped that it would come in a fold out edition like the ""Child's Play"" Series did.  But sometimes you just can't have everything.
  Since I had never seen the ""Producer's Edition"" of Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, I have decided to watch that first before plunging into watching the entire series from start to finish.  This is such a GREAT item to buy if you really like this sort of item.  And I do.  So while this cost me a small fortune, I really am happy I purchased this edition!",1411516800,3,1031,4.225641025641026
6422729,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Now this is how you do a boxed set every movies on its own disc, in its own case with original poster art not no photoshopped BS. Tons of extras old and new and for the 1st time ever an official release of Halloween 6 the producers cut. This is how a boxset should be done.",1411430400,4,273,3.892857142857143
6422730,5,B00KDU8HQQ,if your a big Halloween fan and do not own any of the films on blu ray yet nows your chance to swipe up the whole franchise in one swoop. This set also includes the infamous producers cut of Halloween 6 and a 40 page book about the series. If you love Michael Myers and the Halloween franchise do yourself a favor and purchase this Great set best Halloween release ever!,1411430400,2,370,4.225352112676056
6422731,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Great set, love all the movies some of the negative comments are hilarious some of you people have way too much time on your hands",1411430400,,130,4.24
6422732,5,B00KDU8HQQ,I love the box set everything we could hope for and more. I love the quality of each one of the disc the cases are good. Even thought they are ECO cases there pretty good. Finally this completes all of my horror villeins. For those of you wondering they did improve the AUDIO for HALLOWEEN 1978. The Original MONO soundtrack is back for those who like it. I've seen that some say that the films are not improved but they got the transfers they deserved. Think these movies are almost 20-40 years old there wasn't HD cameras back in day. In conclusion I would defiantly recommend this set even if its just for a few of them. The quality is here folks and I hope that you agree with me.,1411430400,134,684,4.269230769230769
6422733,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Hallelujah!! Great box set, loaded with special features!",1411430400,,57,6.25
6422734,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"This set is (by far) an improvement over previous editions of Halloween.  Many of the movies in this set are a repackage of the previous releases of all the Halloween films with a few  exceptions.  But it is the first time all 10 movies have been released in a package together with similar artwork (so it looks good on the shelf).  But, The biggest improvement in this set compared to previous releases is that it DOES include the Extended TV versions of Halloween (which has only been included in the DVD set years ago) and Halloween II (as far as I know never before released) as well as the Producer's Cut of Halloween:  The Curse of Michael Myers (which has also never been officially released).

  As a Halloween fan I felt that the high price tag was acceptable in order to get the extended and alternate versions of the movies as well as the other bonus features.  Having said this, it is still an extremely high price to pay (especially since I own previous versions on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray).",1411430400,12,1002,4.522222222222222
6422735,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Love it!!! The updated movies are excellent.,1411430400,2,44,5.428571428571429
6422736,1,B00KDU8HQQ,DOES NOT CONTAIN TV VERSION OF HALLOWEEN!!!! It's nothing more the a repackaging of all of the other blu ray releases. only new thing is the producers cut of number 6 and an audio commentary for h20. I feel so ripped off.,1411430400,6,221,4.285714285714286
6422737,4,B00KDU8HQQ,nice halloween blu ray collection. this is a must have for the halloween fan.,1411430400,,77,4.571428571428571
6422738,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I waited for a few months to receive this set, and I couldn't wait! You can find a detailed lay out of every last specification in other reviews but all you really need to know is that Halloween (1978) - Halloween II (the remake) are included, along with the TV versions of Halloween (1978) Halloween II (1981), many special features, and perhaps most valuable, the first ever official home video release of Halloween 6: The Producers Cut! In addition, a small booklet is included with pictures and descriptions of making the films. There are 2 notable films missing however from this set: the theatrical versions of the Rob Zombie Halloween movies. These can be purchased separately on DVD or Blu Ray but why they weren't included is rather baffling considering what was included in this box set.

In any case, if you're reading this you probably already know how all the Halloween films are, so that really just leaves the packaging to discuss. It is common for box sets of films to be made in a mess, but this one is designed excellently. Each film comes in its own standard blu ray case (with special black trim as opposed to the standard blue), which are all seated in one single box for organization. It is a simple design without all the unnecessary boxes within boxes you often get with other box sets. The box itself is also very well designed, as all sides are decorated with paintings of classic Halloween visuals.

I highly recommend this box set to anyone looking to get all the Halloween films in 1080p quality, plus a few bonus films and many extras for a reasonable price. Just know that it technically isn't ""Complete"" as it claims to be.

EDIT: I have checked out the Halloween IV audio sync issue that many have addressed, and maybe it's just my disc or just my player, but the lag that is supposedly there is extremely minimal, if present at all during the sequences people have brought up in the middle of the film. Take that for what you will.",1411430400,3,1965,4.592592592592593
6422739,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Received this today and have been watching one after the other ever since! This set is awesome, packed with extras and the producercut of Halloween 6 looks fantastic on blu ray! If you are a true horror fan and a fan of the Halloween franchise, don't pass up this set! The entire set was put together with care for the fans, and it shows!",1411344000,5,338,4.296875
6422740,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Can not wait to receive this, I was so excited for The Producer's Cut of The Curse of Michael Myers I even splurged on one day shipping! My one pet peeve is that the bonus disc is stored in the case with RZ'S Halloween II. I would have preferred it be in its own or like I had read in the bonus booklet, the main reason being it is a bonus disc for all ten films not just RZ'S Halloween II. But that's just me being my OCD Nerdy self XD",1411344000,7,436,3.802197802197802

6422742,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Love everything about all the Halloween movies! And Jamie Lee Curtis And! We must never forget how great an actor Donald Pleasance was! In the series!!
  Halloween 3 was unrelated to other ones but still enjoyed it.",1410652800,3,215,4.783783783783784
6422743,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"It's all here; all 12 movies (2 unrated), with 3 alternate cuts (featuring the famed Halloween 6 Producer's Cut available officially on home video for the very first time!!!), and a bonus disc in the biggest, greatest, most grand-daddy of all horror box set for one of the most iconic horror series of all time; Halloween!

So yeah, this set is of highest recommendation.",1410652800,10,10108,5.9227053140096615
6422744,5,B00KDU8HQQ,I got an extra $30.00 off the price of this set - because a window popped up on my screen saying that if I apply for a amazon visa - and get approved - they will give me $30.00 off!  I did - and now my cost of this after taxes with free shipping came to $96.10!!  I already own these movies - but this looks like a cute box set - and it will be nice to have all the movies in one box - plus I am looking forward to the bonus material!  I was hesitant to buy it at the pre-order price - but for just under $100.00 - you can't go wrong!!  Thank you amazon - bless your heart!!!!,1410307200,2,576,3.658536585365854
6422745,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Its about time....,1408665600,4,18,5.333333333333333
6422746,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I use to have Halloween extended edition on dvd. I hope it will have the exact same thing in the collection, but as for halloween 3. It should not be in this collection because it has nothing to do with Michael.",1408060800,2,211,4.170731707317073
6422747,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I'm very excited for this set. When I was a kid, I used to be terrified of Michael Myers but I watched every movie when I was kid all the way up to the remakes. Of course, the original John Carpenter's Halloween is the best and my favorite horror film of all time! Anchor Bay and Scream Factory, huge thank you! I will definitely be picking this up on Day 1 and relive my childhood including the remakes during my teenage years.",1407628800,5,428,4.2317073170731705
6422748,2,B00KDU8HQQ,"Lots of cool stuff if you don't already have it.
But:
-TV edits of films are still only DVD quality, I understand it might be hard or even impossible to upgrade that footage though.
-The RZ movies are only in Directors cut versions, and in mine and many others opinions the theatrical versions are wayyy less s***ty, but just like the way he made the movies, he wants things his way and doesn't care what the fans want.

I'm going to be buying this set because for 120$ it's not a bad price to upgrade to blu-ray which I've yet to do for any of them, but  I'll have this big ""Complete Collection"" box, and then RZ Halloweens theatrical cuts (on dvd, since I don't think they've been put out on blu-ray) just hanging out next to it. There's also the issue that a new Halloween 3 is coming out, so that will be hanging outside the box too. (Same reason I chose to buy the Bond movies individually instead of the awkwardly shaped box set). Maybe I'm just a little OCD but when I have a ""complete collection"" I want the entire series together. Main issue here is Rob Zombie's a dick and has not put out his theatrical cuts of the movies on blu-ray which is why this collection doesn't have them in it.",1406764800,7,1197,4.292035398230088
6422749,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I plan to be sick all week from work once this ships, lock the doors, turn off the phone and keep a piss jar near the couch lol, seriously I can't wait for this to be in my hands no movie collection can be talked about with pride unless this boxed set is in it",1406678400,4,260,3.7454545454545456
6422750,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"I don't want to have the rob zombie ones on there, because I think it's crap and was so mad when I went to see it and it wasn't like the real ones. I don't know why it's on here when he says they're not suppose to be like the original right? Not actual question- don't need peoples replies, but okay...if I have to have them on here to have this specific looking set..",1406160000,5,368,3.9864864864864864
6422751,1,B00KDU8HQQ,"...and here's why:

I'm guessing many fans still don't know about this, but around 2006, Don May Jr., owner of Synapse Films, came across boxes of reels from the original ""Halloween"" and bought the footage before it was discarded.

What was on those reels? Don May was quoted as saying ""What we've got is pretty much all the unused original camera negative from John Carpenter's original ""Halloween"". That would mean outtake footage, test footage, alternate scenes (including an alternate ending), etc...

This explains why there never has been behind-the-scenes footage of the first film, outtakes, etc...the footage was initially lost for over 25 years, and now, even though it's been found, the footage remains unreleased because the owners of the franchise have evidently shown no interest in obtaining it for a reasonable price. Just do a search for 'Don May Halloween footage', and you'll get more details.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the holy grail of the Halloween series, but most of the reviews here are glowing about how this set is 'complete', 'epic', 'incredible' - the set would be all of this, only if it included this footage - hours - from the original ""Halloween"".

But it won't.

Oh, but you will get the exact same blu-ray release of ""Halloween 2"" and ""Halloween 3"" - you know, the ones you already bought two years ago.

And, you get the blu-ray of ""Halloween"" - the one you already bought last year. Oh, that's right, it includes the 'rare' TV version they intentionally excluded from the blu-ray last year (but released two different times on DVD) so they could double-dip this year.

And ""Halloween 6"" the producers cut. Which I already bought in a decent widescreen transfer at a horror con for about $7 a few years back. Along with a ton of interviews/retrospectives that were shot in the past year or so that are 'NEW' and never released (and not rare at all).

Think intelligently before buying this, and show support for getting the Don May ""Halloween"" footage released.",1405987200,30,2005,4.8563049853372435
6422752,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Can't wait For This One To Come Out!! I own every single Halloween Movie and box sets out there but I don't Have Them In Complete Blu-Ray Format Discs. I Ordered Mine. Now My Halloween Collection Is Finally Complete! Thanks Anchor Bay!!,1405900800,4,236,4.642857142857143

6422755,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Finally the Red Headed Step child is part of the series.  Halloween II is my all time favorite Halloween.  I always felt that this movie launched Michael into icon status. I love the fact that there are two versions of the 80's movie.  Sorry Rob Zombie's version made Exorcist II look scary and make more sense.......I hate the fact Zombie destroyed doctor Loomis (made him only into making money and plus he had no connection with Michael.) and Laurie Strode( I wanted to kill her in his version of H1, if this was a differnt horror she would have been killed off. She didn't look innocent or act anything like Jamie Lee). I am just happy to see the all the sequels together.",1404777600,10,676,4.479674796747967
6422756,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"Complete? There is no mention of a ""Digital"" transfer of these movies so we can store them in our computers, smart phones, and streaming devices like a ROKU! Our industry has gone digital on everything and I would like to have this on ""Amazon Instant!"" Just on DVD's is archaic!",1404518400,4,278,4.58
6422757,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"I swear.. if at the end of each of Rob Zombie's Halloween remakes H1/H2 -  at the beginning of credits, when it turns black, & there was no sound (like Paranormal Activity1,2,3,ect) id be interesting cause you'd be able to hear what everyone thinks about the movie right after it ends. I wonder how many mix reviews would you hear, & would a little verbal fight break out. IDK, but id be cool if movies did that more often. Hell you can hear everyone opinion at the end of each paranormal movie before the credits hit. IDK, Just Thinkin
 I CANT WAIT TILL THE BLUE RAY Version of the movies come out... excited I am (yoda) :-)

6422758,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Cannot wait to own this ! Huge fan of the entire series . I own the producers cut on a crappy dvr copy and I will relish being able to own it in proper quality. This and the twin peaks set this year really are spoiling fans of the horror / supernatural genre .,1404000000,8,260,3.8333333333333335
6422759,5,B00KDU8HQQ,K cool awesome. Would love this. I hope i'm. Able to have. It for Christmas. Being that it says. Limited Deluxe Edition. Also i don't have. A Blu-Ray disc player. Which i'm also. Getting for Christmas. So i hope. This is still. Available to have. By that time.,1404000000,,260,4.4375
6422760,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"This box set is a landmark in Halloween history because of many things. First the ""producers cut"" of 'Halloween 6' is finally available in a ligament release. Until now the only way to get this version of the film was to buy a crappy bootleg that had the picture and sound quality of a badly aged VHS. With that being said there is another huge reason that this is a ""must buy"". 'Halloween 2' and 'Halloween 3' are owned by 'Universal'. 'Halloween 6', 'Halloween H20', 'Halloween Resurrection' and 'Rob Zombie's Halloween 1 and 2' are owned by 'Dimension'. The rest are owned by 'Anchor Bay Entertainment'. Because of this it has been impossible to get all of the movies in one place, until now. If that doesn't convince you then you are obviously not a true Halloween fan. The box set ""Limited Deluxe Edition"" in the title, emphasis on ""Limited"". Buy this before all copies are sold out. If you wait too long then you are going to have to enter the bidding wars of 'ebay'. Enough said.

Update -10/10/14

When this arrived I was extremely exited about the legendary ""Producer's Cut"". However, what I got was sort of a hybrid of the theatrical and and producer's cut. It's missing some scenes here and there. That footage can be found only in the 'special features' section of the DVD. Also, in the ""true producer's cut"" there are several death scenes that are different from the theatrical version, but we don't get all of them in this cut. Over all this is an excellent movie box set, but I just thought it would only be fair to update my review so that people aren't disappointed. As for the rest of the original review, my opinion remains unchanged. So all in all, this is an epic DVD box set.",1404000000,15,1697,4.52442996742671
6422761,5,B00KDU8HQQ,The absolute best horror franchise has done it. The long awaited release of all these films in one GIGANTIC box set at a GREAT price!!! I can't wait for the release!!!,1403827200,6,167,4.419354838709677
6422762,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Ohhh Yes!!!!! I can't wait till this comes out!!!! Halloween marathon.. whoop whoop!!,1403740800,4,85,5.615384615384615
6422763,2,B00KDU8HQQ,"I'm giving this two star review because the audio on Halloween 4 the return of Michael Myers is completely out of sync and Anchor Bay is refusing to do anything about it. Remember when these people cared? Now they keep copying and pasting the same a BS answer that ""its a problem with the elements"" even though owners of the DVD and original Blu ray will know that's not true. Shame on them.

Aside from this problem.. the box set is pretty remarkable and has a lot of new features  that horror/Halloween will thoroughly enjoy. However, I got this set for the movies (as I have never owned anything beyond part 1 in HD) and with one of them being defective, its a bit of a disappointment",1403740800,3,687,4.4015748031496065
6422764,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"The packaging for the Limited Deluxe Edition is bulkier than I'd care for, but it's a minor issue -- the set looks beautiful, and I'm thrilled that this finally came together and I can buy the whole shebang.  I've refrained from buying ANY Halloween DVDs or Blu-rays during the life of the format, waiting, HOPING for an announcement of this set.  Collectors don't want ten individual DVDs taking up space on their shelves -- we want to own an entire run of something in a neat little box, so It's awesome that two *smart* companies figured this out and are collaborating to give us what we want.  Can someone please do this now for Phantasm, Texas Chainsaw, and Hellraiser?  I'd pre-order in a heartbeat.",1403395200,12,705,4.661290322580645
6422765,5,B00KDU8HQQ,Just biting at the bit waiting for this to come out.  Now if only the originally planned big history book hadn't died on the vine then Halloween this year would have been perfect.,1402963200,7,179,4.424242424242424
6422766,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Finally, the one the fans have been waiting for. This should be amazing.

Does anyone know if there is a planned release for the UK of the 15 disc deluxe edition. So many Halloween fans over here in the UK who would love to snap this up.

If anyone has heard of a UK release, please let me know.",1402790400,3,295,3.983050847457627
6422767,5,B00KDU8HQQ,I can't wait until this is released. Though some of the sequels were bad in the late 80s-90s mainly due to bad actors and scripts but still fun to watch. If only John Carpentar would write and direct a new Halloween it would be amazing I'm sure.,1402617600,3,245,4.23404255319149
6422768,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"Is a digital download disc included? Since the home entertainment medium is shifting away from physical DVDs & Blu-ray discs it would seem logical to have an option to download this to your favorite streaming sites like VUDU, Amazon Instant Video, and ITunes. Other than that this Boxset sounds like a winner. I hope they didn't leave out the option to download it digitally. Other titles that have gotten the digital option are: Sleepaway Camp, Day of the Dead, F13th Box set, NOES boxset, Tales From the Crypt..etc.kkkkmkmkmkkk  llkl",1402617600,3,535,5.01123595505618

Great to see that Halloween 6 is finally being released in it's full length version.  Also, great to see all of the Halloween movies on blu ray together.  This is the greatest box set to date!!!",1401408000,6,339,4.677966101694915
6422770,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"After YEARS of waiting, speculating, and flat out losing my mind that this box set hadn't happened yet its finally coming. This has by far been my favorite horror franchise and in one form or another I've owned all of them. But getting impatient I was heavily considering buying them individually on blu ray because I was tired of waiting for the box set. This news couldn't have come at a better time.  Of course I have pre ordered the limited deluxe edition with enough content to keep me entertained for six months, and it's worth every penny. I absolutely cannot wait to have all of Michael Myers terrors in one package it is a dream come true",1400889600,5,647,4.483050847457627
6422771,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"My review is about the Halloween 4 audio sync
now my.review last time was terrible so. I have read that some people had and some people didn't and i didn't have no problem with my Halloween 4 and the producers cut of part 6 was awesome and h20is back to normal and it comes with. a booklet about the franchise but why did they have to put. Rob zombies Halloweens in it isn't it bad enough i had to.spend 9 bucks to see part 2",1400803200,2,425,4.011764705882353
6422772,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"Im excited about this release. It's about time they did this everyone else had there box set so what's up with leaving Mikey out, I was going to buy the new anniversary edition of Halloween 35th as well as the new H3 but since there coming in this box set ill wait...  also we get to see the producer cut of H6 which I did see a few years ago but it wasn't that clear picture",1400803200,3,375,3.9342105263157894
6422773,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"This set has the making of the best set ever released.  Now Every ""Halloween"" film has some sort of controversy. There is several things that should be released on this set that has never been released on home video.  Here is the highlight of the most wanted things""

HALLOWEEN  1978 .  It would be great if this set would include the alternate footage and outtakes that were found years ago.
HALLOWEEN  II  1981  The set Scream Factory released in 2012 was great but what would be nice is to have interviews that were conducted from the ""Halloween"" 35th Anniversary.  Also Deleted footage that Rick Rosenthal talked about where Michael is in the nursery and the wind up toy starts up.  There also another scene that Dana Carvey was in that was cut with Mrs Alves talking to reports outside the Hospital.  These scenes were filmed but have never been seen by the general public
HALLOWEEN III  1982  Well there was gore that had to edited down.  Rumors of more graphic deaths scenes say they stillexcist
HALLOWEEN IV  1988  Behind the scene footage was not included but exist.  Screen Test of many of the actors have been rumored at one time were to be included on past release, The original footage of Multiple Myers.
HALLOWEEN V  1989  It would be nice to see the scene where Jamie was stabbed  in the leg.  The alternate opening sequence would be nice to see
HALLOWEEN Vi-  Were are finally getting to see the Producers cut.  Fingers crossed that the original negative gets a restoration of this cut.
HALLOWEEN H20  1998 It would be great if we get those scenes shown on television included in this release.  Also the footage that was shot with a different mask.  Camera Test footage of the different mask,  The TV cut would be nice to be included
HALLOWEEN  8 2002  Give us the Original version that sent the film back into production",1400716800,12,1837,4.6006191950464395
6422774,5,B00KDU8HQQ,"It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to one good scare.

Thank You Anchor Bay and Scream Factory for putting together this awesome set.

10/10/14 UPDATE - GOOD NEWS REGARDING THE SYNCH ISSUES WITH H4!

I read the following press release on Dread Central. It is also on Anchor Bay's FB page.

On behalf of Anchor Bay and Scream Factory, we want to thank everyone that has purchased the Halloween Complete Collection. We hope you are enjoying it and all the work that went into bringing it to you, the fans. Unfortunately there is an audio sync issue with Halloween 4 that has always existed on that film with every release. We attempted to fix one of the problems prior to this release but in doing so, it created sync issues elsewhere in the film, which has now come to light. For the past two weeks we have been working to fix the problems that have arisen and we have been able to fix the sync issues at the 46 minute mark. We will be issuing a replacement disc to anyone that has been affected.

If you were affected by a Halloween 4 sync issue and would like a replacement disc sent to you, please follow these instructions:

In order to receive a replacement with the first batch being sent, send an e-mail to ABEHalloween4@Starz.com no later than October 31, 2014 and include the following:

1) Proof of purchase (photo or scan of receipt or digital receipt from on-line retailer)
2) Your name
3) Mailing address

Your replacement disc will then be shipped to arrive no later than November 14, 2014.

Thank you again for bringing Michael home.

Updated 14 July:

Today Shout Factory posted a picture of Danielle Harris being interviewed about her involvement in Halloween 4 and 5, so there's another great interview to add to the already confirmed interviews with Jamie Lee and Josh Hartnett.

Updated 3 July:

There have been a few updates since I first posted this review...below are the updates:

- The Producer's Cut will in fact be from the 35mm negative and will be 1080p blu-ray, so that's great news.  This was confirmed on Daniel Farrands' Facebook page.

- Jamie Lee Curtis and Steve Miner just recorded an all-new commentary for H20 just a few days ago, along with new interviews as well, so H20 looks to be a full-fledged special edition.  Still no word on a new transfer, but I can't imagine them using Echo Bridges shoddy transfer.

- New artwork was released on 13 June and it is stunning.  There will be different box art for each release (10-disc and 15-disc).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The section below is directly from the press release. The fact the we are finally getting the Producer's Cut of Curse warrants 5 stars automatically. But with Shout Factory doing most of the heavy lifting, we are sure to get one of the greatest horror box sets ever.  Anchor Bay and SF put a lot of work into giving the fans a definitive box set that encompasses the entire Halloween franchise. This is gonna be epic!

The 15-disc Limited Edition deluxe set is spread across 15 discs and includes every Halloween feature film:
Halloween (Original & 35th Anniversary)
Halloween II
Halloween III: Season of the Witch
Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers
Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers
Halloween H20
Halloween: Resurrection
Rob Zombie's Halloween
Rob Zombie's Halloween II
The set also offers:
Never-before-released producer's cut of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers
Ultra-rare network TV version of the original Halloween
Network TV version of Halloween II
Unrated version of Rob Zombie's Halloween
Unrated version of Rob Zombie's Halloween II
The set is packed with hours of brand new bonus features as well, including new interviews with cast and crew from the entire franchise. In response to years of fan feedback, the first Halloween will now also include the original mono audio track and the set will include both versions of the original Halloween: the original Blu-ray release and the recently remastered 35th Anniversary version with the mono track added back in.

It also comes with a limited edition 40-page book written by Michael Gingold of Fangoria Magazine. The collectible packaging will include a newly commissioned illustration on the outer case and each film will be in its own black Blu-ray case with the original theatrical one sheet as the key art.

""This compilation is the ultimate collector's item for fans of the Halloween films and a testament to all the wonderful talent that have worked on them,"" remarked Malek Akkad, President of Trancas International Films and son of series producer Moustapha Akkad. ""The partnership between Anchor Bay Entertainment and Scream Factory to present fans for the first time with all the Halloween films in one definitive package is a tribute to everyone - including my father - who made these films the terrifying classics they are today.""

The 10-disc Edition includes the original theatrical versions of the Halloween films, as well as select bonus features.",1400544000,75,12935,5.3836228287841195

8657944,4,B00KDU8HQQ,"Not all the films in the collection are classic, just like the Frankenstein films released by Universal.  But, like those classic Universal films, they're fun and worth the watch.  However, I will admit that I'm not big on the Rob Zombie remake.  I liked Mike Myers better as the boogey-man with a murky past.  I didn't want to see him as a kid.  Somehow that cheapened his later incarnation somehow.  And, seeing him as a picked on kid who has a horrible home-life makes his turn less scary.  When you have him turning from an apparently normal kid into a mindless, mute killer behind a mask, that is spooky.  There is no explanation of why.  He's just evil.  And that's that.",1530230400,,677,4.520661157024794
