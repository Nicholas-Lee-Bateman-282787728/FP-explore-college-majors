She has you work one side of the body and then says to pause the DVD and finish the other side on your own.  Being new to the technique, I couldn't remember all the steps to complete the movement on the other side.  I would of had to either rewind the DVD to replay the section I just did or start from the beginning to ensure both sides received the same amount of exercise.",1337126400,18,456,4.206896551724138

Somatics might sound like something in the philosophy department, but it is, without question, the simplest fastest way to literally ""forget"" injuries and overcome training errors. Some of the movements are so simple that you will literally look behind the door for the conjurer hidden with the magic wand. Injured as a Highland Games athlete, I did a lot of things to fix my hip and, to be honest, a lot worked. But, nothing transformed me more than Martha's simple techniques. Martha is the ""go to girl"" for male athletes looking for the pain free edge.
