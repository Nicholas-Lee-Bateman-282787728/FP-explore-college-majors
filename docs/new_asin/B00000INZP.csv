1230088,3,B00000INZP,"Watches like a propaganda rehash of films during Vietnam war that supported American actions in SE Asia. It expends a lot of unnecessary film recounting depredations of the Russian dominated Pathet Lao government upon its own people, at the expense of the fuller development of the love triangle between the controlling Russian General and the American journalist who contend for the love of the Laotian lady who loyalties remain unclear until the end. Another demerit is the amount of film wasted on underwater river scenes that are a poor substitute for further development of the plot, along with the repetitive, boring music and lack of any commentary by his friends on the river bank, or any other human sound to accompany these scenes. The acting of Landon is just bearable, but that of the girl, Keo, and the Russian officer, salvage the film to some extent. Would not recommend to anyone. Ending is sappy and improbable, although supposedly a true story.",1481155200,,962,4.9813664596273295
1230089,2,B00000INZP,"TOO FADED OUT, SHOULD BE MADE INTO BLU-RAY GOOD STORY THOUGH, IWAS IN THAT AREA AT THE TIME",1477094400,,91,4.111111111111111
1230090,5,B00000INZP,It's an older movie yet a great story based on real  events.,1474070400,,60,4.0
1230091,3,B00000INZP,"Great love story, but it was hard to watch because of the quality of the filming....like it was worn out from being shown too many times.",1473724800,,137,4.3076923076923075
1230092,1,B00000INZP,The movie was distorted and difficult to watch. Horrible picture.,1472169600,,65,5.6
1230093,4,B00000INZP,It's a copy of an older made-for-tv movie so it doesn't come in a box just a sleeve but it played like an older movie (meaning a little faded) with no skips. The only thing that was off was the sound. I played it on my desktop so I could use earphones which helped as I had the volume up as high as it could go.,1471910400,,311,3.727272727272727
1230094,2,B00000INZP,I agree with others that this is an excellent story. However the DVD copy is very poor. Both the picture and sound quality are washed out. The DVD looks and sounds like its a boot legged product,1471737600,,194,4.27027027027027
1230095,1,B00000INZP,The picture including the color was very poor. And the sound was even worse. We were really looking forward to the movie we could only see about 10 minutes and we had to discontinue it .,1470787200,,186,4.194444444444445
1230096,5,B00000INZP,"Michael Landon as you've never seen him before. You know him from his Kodak commercials, as Pa Ingalls, and as Jonathan,the precocious Angel on Highway to Heaven. In this sinewy and low budget production, you get to see him make love,and take off his top.",1468713600,,255,4.688888888888889

1230098,1,B00000INZP,Not a good film for quality and the sound was not wonderful either.  Did not finish it.,1466467200,,87,4.117647058823529
1230099,2,B00000INZP,Unfortunately didn't like the movie was not a very good picture and couldn't hear the movie sounded very restored,1458345600,,113,5.0
1230100,2,B00000INZP,I was pleased.  It was as expected.,1452816000,,35,4.0
1230101,1,B00000INZP,"I remember watching this when it first ran in 1983. If I had videotaped it then and rewatched it now, it would have been far superior audio and video to this joke. Seriously, is this some kind of joke. It looks like amazon took someone's badly VHS taped copy that they were getting off of a bad rabit ears antenna signal and (badly) transferred it to video. It was like watching a locally produced TV commercial from the 1960s.

I really was just trying to watch it to hear the Laura Branigan song ""Love is Forever"" but who knows if it's even in there. I just could not bear the horrendous video quality any longer.",1450137600,3,615,4.3478260869565215
1230102,1,B00000INZP,I have a copy of the movie that is in real bad shape.  The one I purchased which is supposed to be digitally remastered wasn't any better than my old copy.,1444003200,,155,4.0
1230103,1,B00000INZP,It is a good movie that we watched some years ago however this copy had very poor quality of both picture and sound. Disappointed.,1443830400,,130,4.458333333333333
1230104,5,B00000INZP,Arrived well in advance of due date. Thank you,1442361600,,46,4.222222222222222
1230105,2,B00000INZP,"Apparently once a TV movie, which would've been okay, except I would think some effort would have been made to clean it up when they digitized it.  Maybe the master had degraded?  At any rate, it definitely detracted from a film I missed back when it came out.  Good story, but considering the quality, it's way overpriced at more than $14 for a Dvd.  Bottom line: don't blow your cash on it; watch it free from Amazon Prime or not at all.",1437782400,2,439,4.317073170731708
1230106,1,B00000INZP,The movies were so dark you could hardly see the movie I ordered two of t hese and would like two new movies sent to me.  They were so horrible both of them that I could only see about five seconds of the movie,1435363200,,210,3.772727272727273

1230111,1,B00000INZP,"The review is about the so called ""digitally remastered"" edition : the movie being one of my all-time favourites, I bought this edition, paying the fastest shipment because I was so impatient to rediscover the film with a good picture quality. But it's even worse than some very averge editions already existing. Don't buy this, you'll lose your money.",1424908800,,352,4.983050847457627

1230113,3,B00000INZP,Love the story line but the video is in deplorable condition which makes it almost impossible to watch! Since I saw it when it originally aired I never forgot it and do tell friends and family about it. Was very glad to obtain a copy but again disappointed with the quality.,1420070400,,274,4.392156862745098
1230114,1,B00000INZP,Was like an old B movie could not get into it love Michael Landon but this is not one of his good ones at all,1396569600,,109,3.4
1230115,5,B00000INZP,"This is an excellent true story ~ played by beautiful people and the plot is from real life ~  ~ ~ I loved that it was filmed on location ~ the atmosphere and scenery help tell a difficult but honest account ~ The political climate is eye-opening and the love story almost fails, but it wins at the very end ~ I don't want to spoil the tense ending ~ but the River plays a role in the two people symbolizing two opposite worlds coming together after the impossible is reached.  I love this film and really respect Michael Landon ~ ~ ~ Get ready for your emotions to be touched. :)",1394323200,,580,4.169642857142857
1230116,3,B00000INZP,"The sound on the dvd, for this movie, is unintelligible. Some scenes on the dvd were almost as bad as the sound. Sorry excuse for selling a movie as ""new"". The VHS tape has a fair, and sometimes good, sound track that is understandable. Michael Landon delivers another memorable performance.  He's sorely under-rated as an actor.  Would have been one of the greats. The quality of the tape is poor, but beats the dvd and is worth the purchase price for the performances.",1378425600,,470,4.650602409638554
1230117,2,B00000INZP,"while we enjoyed the movie i.e. plot, stars, story very much, the quality of the video was very poor.  It appeared to have been taped from a tv show (swear words bleeped out, spots where commercials had been edited out) onto vhs and then transferred to dvd.  The sound was very muffled, sometimes very difficult to hear, and the picture was very grainy and fuzzy.",1357516800,3,363,4.569230769230769

1230119,1,B00000INZP,"The quality of this DVD was very disappointing as it was very grainy and had poor colour.  The movie itself was quite good, but it was quality of the print that let it down.",1344384000,4,173,4.088235294117647
1230120,2,B00000INZP,"I am thankful that (weeks later and after a time-consuming telephone call) Amazon.com refunded my money.  The digital video disc that arrived would not play in my laptop computer, in a notebook computer, or in two DVD players connected to televisions.  The message on the screen said something about no disk being inserted.  That is the first problem that i have had with anything that i have purchased through Amazon.com.",1302480000,,422,5.0
1230121,1,B00000INZP,Picture and sound quality were terrible and the last quarter of the movie had really bad glitches. but considering it was only 2 dollars i probably should have known better.,1276473600,,173,4.8
1230122,2,B00000INZP,i bought this dvd from synegery and it is a poor quality of this movie. you cannot understand what they are sayong and tj color is terrible. i will not buy anything else from them,1263513600,,179,4.142857142857143
1230123,3,B00000INZP,"Firstly Priscilla Presley was hardly in this movie,so i don't think deserved to be on the cover,secondly,the quality of it was terrible and thirdly,it was nothing like i expected,i would return it for a refund if i could but its been too long so will have to recycle it instead.
Amazon never disappoint me so i will take this one as a rare disappointment,the movie plot though was quite emotional,couldn't hear some of the dialogue so had to guess what was being said,music background was too loud to be able to hear the vocals at times,so as you can tell i was very disappointed over all!",1260662400,,589,4.566037735849057
1230124,3,B00000INZP,"I know a few of the principal characters depicted in this film, including Everingham. It's amusing to see how H'wood boils the story down to the elements it finds most marketable. The real story is actually much more byzantine and complex, and would have made a good thriller. This is more a love story.

The actress who plays Everingham's Lao wife is Laura Gemser, a Dutch citizen of Indonesian descent who was well-known at the time for her porn films, most notably a few in the Emmanuelle series (incl Black Emmnuelle, Emanuelle and the Cannibals). It's said that director Hall Bartlett insisted she use a pseudonym for this reason, ""Moira Chen."" Even on the set he allegedly forbade the cast and crew from calling her by her real name.",1217808000,,739,4.728682170542636

He fall in love with a native woman that help him.

The love theme is beautiful and the country exotic.

Good acting and nice supporting cast.

This DVD edition is unacceptable. The image is worse than any videotape and the sound is extremely unpleasant. For this reason I rate it only one star.",1126915200,4,463,4.75
