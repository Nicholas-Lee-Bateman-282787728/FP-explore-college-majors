4504189,5,B004Z0P77W,Stephen's words are just about his own experience. I appreciate his works and words as if I were a piano technician. We feel his exciting feelings and that tells us how he loves his work. I watched this movie over 5 times! I love it. Thank you!,1365120000,,244,4.212765957446808

4504191,5,B004Z0P77W,I found thia video interesting when you learn how the artist and technicians work so closely together for a concert.  I was also surprised to find a venue with so many auditoriums to chose from.  Excellence with Joy.,1357948800,,216,4.657894736842105

4504193,5,B004Z0P77W,"Great insight for those interested in the workings of the grand piano, and for those not so interested, a view of some piano greats and what they demand of their tuner/technicians as they prepare for major concerts.",1355097600,,215,4.837837837837838
4504194,5,B004Z0P77W,"This is a fascinating and insightful look into the life of a very talented and dedicated Steinway master piano technician.  Much of the film centers on Stephan Knupfer's professional relationship with talented professional pianists.  It is remarkable how far this highly cultured and esoteric European world is removed from what most of us experience!  Long discussions about highly subjective issues of piano preparation consume much of Knupfer's life.  In particular, the talented but extraordinarily finicky French pianist Aimard would exasperate a lesser man, but Knupfer shows remarkable aplomb and patience in trying to satisfy his (at times impossible) demands.  The film is not highly technical in its detail, but you do get a good sense of how difficult this work is (especially when dealing with highly demanding top artists).  And you get a sense of just how broad and deep Knupfer's knowledge of Steinway grands really is, and in particular how incredibly refined and detailed that knowledge is.  If you are a pianist, especially, you don't want to miss this one, but any musician would find much of interest here.  And there is plenty human interest to satisfy non-musicians as well.  An extremely well done and unique documentary/feature with top production values.  Highly recommended.",1351296000,2,1300,5.328431372549019
4504195,5,B004Z0P77W,"Pianomania one of the best movies I have seen. I ordered several and give them as presents to my friends. A little bit self serving, because I am a piano tuner/technician myself and see me as the actor of this really entertaining DVD.
It is entertaining to the non professional also and it is so hard to imagine where the fine line about ""Mania"" is starting.",1344297600,2,358,4.4393939393939394
4504196,3,B004Z0P77W,"Ok, now we have TWO documentaries featuring Pierre-Laurent Aimard having a really hard time finding a Steinway that suits him.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that this is a pretty  interesting look into just how exacting these very fine musicians are about sound and how they struggle to find language, to communicate, about these subtle aspects of piano sound.",1331424000,4,370,4.935483870967742
4504197,5,B004Z0P77W,"""Pianomania"" follows Stefan Knpfer, Steinway & Sons' master tuner in Vienna, as he works with some of the world's best known concert pianists, including Lang Lang, Pierre-Laurent Aimard and Alfred Brendel. Warm, and at times gently humorous, the film reveals how more unsung hero Knpfer is pivotal to realising the vision of each virtuoso, showing us the art, the science and the passion behind the search for perfection.  No detail is too small or inconsequential for Knpfer, even down to the tiniest speck of dust.  Humorous and surpising peek into the world where few have ever visited.  Gives new appreciation to a 'concert' performance.  Makes a wonderful* double feature with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Note-by-Note-The-Making-of-Steinway-L1037/dp/B001P8M9FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Note by Note: The Making of Steinway L1037</a>",1311033600,28,886,6.358333333333333

4504201,4,B004Z0P77W,"This was a very interesting account of a piano technician who really had to ""jump through hoops"" in order to fix/prepare Bosendorfer Pianos for recordings and concerts in Austria.  Each performing artist has his own style, his own idea of what the instrument should sound like and how it should react, and it's up to the technician to make it happen, not just by tuning, but by ""voicing"" the hammers, working on the action, etc.  This is in German with English subtitles, though some parts are in English.",1464998400,,505,4.7272727272727275

4504214,3,B004Z0P77W,Fascinating to see the preparation that goes into a public performance and the way musicians hear sounds. The negative is the repetition of the same things.,1445472000,,156,5.038461538461538
4504215,5,B004Z0P77W,"This video brought to light just how important a tuner is, and the acoustics of the performance hall.  It is vicarious conditioning to just see the beautiful pianos, and to imagine playing on them.",1438992000,,197,4.794117647058823

4504217,1,B004Z0P77W,This film is vastly overated. My short film was paired with it at Mendocino Film Festival in 2011 and it won the feature doc prize at SFIFF in 2010 so I wanted to see it since I was attending the director's party when it screened. It's just another European film that European film snobs that love peoole talking with accents can get off on.

4504221,3,B004Z0P77W,Interesting but does not dig very deep. Enjoyable but shallow on details. It reminded me of watching a some random home movie clips with little context.,1405036800,,152,4.884615384615385
4504222,5,B004Z0P77W,"The pursuit for perfection is not unknown in the world of art, but how many of us have ever realized that pursuit can be found behind the scenes in the art world, and in what is normally thought to be the purely technical side of things? In this case, being a piano technician. The film could easily be entitled THE ART OF THE PIANO TECHNICIAN, but PIANOMANIA is more accurate, really, because there is true mania on display, that is, if we understand mania to be a heightened energy and focusthe opposite of depression. In that light, the title is apt.

In the world of classical piano, Steinway & Sons have long been recognized as the principle supplier of quality instruments worldwide. It is understandable that great instruments require equally masterful maintenance. Therefore it is logical that the best of these technicians require the right mixture of qualities, namely technical skill, a superior work ethic, an appreciation for the music they help to create (by providing the artists with the best instruments in optimum condition), boundless enthusiasm, obsessive attention to detail, a finely tuned ear, a sense of humour and a psychiatrists ability to deal with quirky and neurotic personalities (the artists).

Stefan Knupfer is precisely that type of individual. As Steinway & Sons Chief Technician and Master Tuner in Vienna, Knupfers world is one of variety, privilege and very great demands on his expertise. To quote the box art for the film, no detail is too small or too inconsequential for Knupfer, not ever the tiniest speck of dust on a piano string.

The film is briliant on a number of levels, but what is most impressive is the technical standard of the soundtrack. Clearly a film that focuses on details of soundgetting a pitch just right for a very picky pianistmust be recorded at a high standard so that the audience can hear for themselves the subtleties and nuances being bandied about. Documentary filmmaking is often a hit-the-ground-running scenario where you work without a script and have to be very much on top of things to capture what is at hand, much of it spontaneous. The filmmakers accomplish this miracle and then some.

The world of classical music is not for everyone, and PIANOMANIA will simply not be of interest to some people. But the pursuit of perfection is compelling when coupled with an interesting and amenable personality (like Knupfers). His job requires a sense of humour, and that element helps to make him a fascinating protagonist. You don't have to appreciate classical music to enjoy this film.

On a side note, there is a sequence where Knupfer interacts with the classical comedy duo Igudesman & Joo which allows Knupfer to let his hair down. This eccentric duo, highly capable concert musicians who emphasize comedy in their act with the stated goal to make classical music more appealing to the masses, is a much needed shot in the arm in this film, as prior to their appearance we have been privy to the eccentric behaviour of some of the worlds great pianists who, great artists though they are, aren't the most jolly fellows around. Some of their nitpicking about pitch and tone may even be annoying for some viewers, though this accurately represents the kinds of issues Knupfer has to contend with in his job.

Like a perfectly tuned concert grand, PIANOMANIA hits all the right notes and fills the screen with highs and lows, pianissimo and forte, drama and comedy. Highly recommended.",1397433600,2,3462,4.90940170940171
4504223,4,B004Z0P77W,"Friend recommended it, and it's good to be sure, but more a serious documentary about the requirements of recording artists than the sendup involving my least favorite pianists (Alfred Brendl and Bang Bhang) that I was hoping for. . . the guy is really good at coaxing the sound out of a Steinway though. Interesting glimpse of the professional backstage world.",1381017600,,361,4.934426229508197
4504224,5,B004Z0P77W,"I use this video in several languages, during the piano technique courses I give for people all over the world. The students are watching this video in the evening, after one of the course days and it gives them a good idea about  the piano technicians' work in the 'field'. It is very instructive and entertaining as well...

Best wishes,

4504226,5,B004Z0P77W,"Voicing and tuning a piano already require nearly infinite patience.  And making things work for the ""specialized"" masters at the piano requires yet another level of patience.  The personality of Knupfer is simply magnetic.  He mesmerizes you with his technical wizardry at working each fine detail of the pianos.  This excellent documentary manages to turn a subject that normally doesn't get people excited into mirror that reflects passion and the human soul.  Well done!",1370476800,,474,5.351351351351352
