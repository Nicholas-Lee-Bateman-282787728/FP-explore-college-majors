3912507,5,B002DQUAT0,"Hi everyone.
I had the opportunity to see Cliff & The Shadows Final Reunion at our beautifull Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens in Cape Town. It was AWESOME. The last time they were in South Africa was 1961. I have always been a fan even after they split. In 1961 I didn't have the money to go and see them and also I was only in gr 4.
Although all of them grew older (as I have) I know that we are all still young at heart and spirit.

I hope they keep on making their beautifull music.",1268870400,,484,4.041666666666667
3912508,5,B002DQUAT0,"It's great to have a video record of these living legends.  The performance is flawless.  They all look to be having a great time performing.  Who could ask for more.  It's truly unfortunate that these guys never had any kind of presence here in the USA.
For that reason, they didn't play even 1 date on their 2009/10 tour in the USA or Canada.  Whatta shame.

It's too late in their careers now, but I believe many of the songs could be hits today and in fact revive the flagging music industry.

I might even buy a 2nd copy just in case something happens to my original.  If you want more of the Shads alone, I highly recommend the Final Tour DVD/CD combo.  I wonder why Eagle didn't release a double CD of this DVD?  It would certainly be worth having.

Don't waste another second.  Order your copy of this DVD NOW...before Amazon runs out...again.",1267833600,8,851,4.419354838709677
3912509,5,B002DQUAT0,"Any one who likes early British and US Rock 'N' Roll will really enjoy this DVD.  The Shadows are one of the best all time selling instrumental rock groups ranking right up there with The Ventures of the US, Japan and other International fame.  The Shadows got their start by backing the vocalist Cliff Richard, the group Cliff Richard and The Shadows had several hits in the UK and Europe predating the Beatles and Rolling Stones.  Their music is excellent and the video and audio on this DVD is also superb.  These guys got their influence from Elvis, Buddy Holly, and Duane Eddy and developed a style of their own.  This DVD is well worth the price and is excellent.",1266710400,2,669,4.541666666666667
3912510,5,B002DQUAT0,"This concert is everything it should be: Cliff & the boys are in such amazing shape, it's hard to believe they're all Old Age Pensioners!  They're on top form, and the O2 Arena is packed.  I must admit I prefer Cliff's rockers to the ballads, but he's a complete professional whatever he does.

The picture and the editing are both excellent &mdash; as is the sound, which provides a choice of Dolby 2.0 or 5.1.

My only regret is the absence of Jet Harris.  Can there still be bitterness even after fifty years?  Oh well.",1262044800,26,1677,4.640677966101695
3912511,5,B002DQUAT0,"It's easy to forget that Cliff Richard and The Shadows were only together for ten years, 1958-1968 or perhaps more accurately 1959 -1968. They were the soundtrack of my life through those teenage years of mine. This DVD and concert represent that period in their history. Anyone looking for Cliff songs after that period (Devil Woman, Miss You Nights, We Don't Talk Anymore, From a Distance and so on) will not find them here.

The quality of this DVD is outstanding. It is so well filmed that you only rarely see a camera, the sound is crisp and, as mentioned in other reviews, not a lip-syncher in sight. We were fortunate to be at the Sheffield concert on Cliff's 69th birthday and can vouch that this DVD is the complete concert. Even the beginning pictures of microphones and guitars are exactly what are seen in the arena. It is just like being at the concert. The Shadows were in fine form for their set. I personally would have loved it had they played `Flingel Bunt' but it was not to be. And does anybody look like they are having a better time than Hank Marvin? The sounds that he gets out of a guitar are extraordinary.

All 42 songs are great. My only disappointment is with `Willie and the Hand Jive'. I wish they had performed the original Hank solo at the beginning instead of a newer arrangement. But I nitpick. For the traditionalist, it was interesting to see that the version of `Move It' they performed only includes the original 1958 words; it does not include the additional verse written I think some 20 years later.

I recommend this DVD to anyone who was there on this tour. It is a priceless souvenir. I also recommend it to anyone who couldn't go. Once you view this DVD, you'll think you were there.",1261440000,20,1728,4.514376996805112

3912523,5,B002DQUAT0,Great DVD of a terrific show that I saw live at the Hunter Valley a few years back. Thoroughly recommend this DVD to any old rockers who grew up listening to the Shadows (during the surfing era) and Cliffie Boy.

3912543,5,B002DQUAT0,"So sad Cliff Richard never well known in he U.S. - he's a hit everywhere else.  (Also a really nice guy - and women who have seen his photo as a 70-year-old in a swinsuit...look at his website.)
This is music from his first ten years (50's to 60's)) and the talented Shadows. Set yourself for that Rock 'n' Roll
including what even John Lennon called the first of England's real Rock 'N' Roll song, ""Move It"". Included are Shadows records even took #1 to take Richard's place - and many to hear in this DVD.
(Other music from Sir Cliff -such as ""Devil Woman"", ""We Don'd Talk Anymore"" and so many are available on Amazon. He sold 200 million, has many, many #1 hits.)
There are reasons he did not hit the U.S., but it is worth his talent.  A few DVD's are available (not his great 50-year-old celebration yet), but many CDs are available.
As a (long-ago now) dj, not being able to introduce his talent to friends was so sad.
So, begin with the Shadows and Cliff Richard with updated version of the 50's and 60's, and you might take a look at the long-list of talent still being sung by Richard.'s first",1349654400,,1101,4.339805825242719
3912544,5,B002DQUAT0,"Having decided not to go to the concerts, I decided to have my own ""take-home"" version.
I was not disappointed!
Cliff's ususal totally professional presentation, The Shadows backings, and their own numbers, are all presented impecably, and I have already watched the concert a few times.
If you have enjoyed their music in the past, you'll love this video!",1324166400,,356,5.0508474576271185
3912545,5,B002DQUAT0,"Those who said this concert was as good as when the boys were in their prime are wrong. It's better.

Thank goodness I, and Cliff and the Shadows, have stayed around long enough to be able to appreciate the technical advances which make performances like this so enjoyable. The sound is immaculate, the visuals are exciting and the camerawork brings the concert right into your living room. I remember so well seeing Cliff and the Shadows on a little flickering black and white screen lip-synching the songs; not because they couldn't perform them live, but because the live sound simply couldn't be recorded adequately.

Not that any technical advance would matter if the group couldn't deliver the goods. Happily, that isn't so; both the vocals and the instrumental backdrop are right on the money. These guys are totally professional and as tight as if they'd never stopped performing together. More than that, they are having such a good time that it's impossible not to share their enthusiasm.

The songs are familiar to everyone who knows their work and they haven't fiddled about much with the arrangements. In this day of dragged out, endless repetitions of lines which had little melody to start with, it's amazingly refreshing to hear songs which never last more than 3 minutes and yet leave you humming a tune. Today's artists, good as many of them are, could take a listen to this material and realize that more isn't always better (though I have to say that lyrically these aren't the most sophisticated songs around; 'Lucky Lips' and 'Dancing Shoes', for example, are pretty naive by today's standards!).

Of its type, this DVD is as good as it gets. Thoroughly recommended.",1308528000,,1688,4.912280701754386
3912546,4,B002DQUAT0,I grew up with Cliff and the Shadows.  This recording with the benefit of modern sound and the addition of a full set of drums for Brian made this a great return to my youth.,1306713600,,174,3.9714285714285715

WOW -- these guys look and sound fantastic!  As a teen I remember how we would dance to Cliff's and The Shadows' music and the songs certainly bring back a lot of memories.

Sound quality -- terrific!  The show itself - par excellence!  What great entertainment...I didn't want the concert to end.  Wish they could do more.

3912556,5,B002DQUAT0,"Cliff Richard and The Shadows first came together in 1958,spending the next 10 years racking up aton of hits.
Upon the 50th anniversary of their formation, they re-recorded 20 or so songs as well as 3 new cuts.
The album was performed in it's entirety, along with several Shadows hits and Cliff solo hits, for a 42-song blockbuster show of which their London performance was filmed.

Cliff's voice is as strong as it ever was, and from rockers like ""Move It"", ""Nine Times Out Of Ten"" ""Please Don't Tease"" & ""Gee Whiz, It's You"", to ballads like ""The Next Time"" and ""Visions"" and pop fare like ""Livin' Doll"", ""Travellin' Light"" & ""I Love You"", Cliff can still nail them down.

The Shadows are so musically tight, the words are unspoken, but understood. Bruce Welch is as solid a rhythm guitarist as you'll find, as well as a supreme vocal harmonist; drummer Brian Bennett is one of the all-time greats and can play in any style;
Brian's son Warren and Keith Hayman add wonderful keyboard textures; bassist Mark Griffiths has tenured longer than any Shadows bassist, and is the best since John Rostill.

The Shadows' true musical voice is of course lead guitarist Hank Marvin who not only graces the Shadows songs, but adds spice to Cliff's songs as well.
His trusty Stratocaster is the musical centerpiece of the show, and he even pulled the Burns electric 12-string out for ""Don't Talk To Him"" & ""On The Beach"".

The Shadows' songs include: ""Apache"" ""Shadoogie"" ""Wonderful Land"" ""Atlantis"" and more.

Great playing and singing, great audio and video.

This DVD brought back lots of good memories of how simple things were back in my youth era. Lyrics were clean, great rhythm and music were at its greatest at that time, with Elvis Presley and all. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who simply grew up with Cliff Richard and the Shadows. They still sing great and their chemistry never changed.
