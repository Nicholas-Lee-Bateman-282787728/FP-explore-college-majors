8268781,5,B00187X2PE,Bill Gaither and his family of artist are great. Never seen a bad video and hopefully I won't. I have at least 50 or more of his videos and I never get tired of great singers and music. You will enjoy some of the old timers and the new ones. Good old gospel music is what you will see on this video. Love it....,1388620800,2,311,3.875
