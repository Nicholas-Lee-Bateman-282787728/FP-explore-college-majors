7848796,5,6303503411,"Joseph Campbell delves into an archeology of mythology by taking us back to the first storytellers, our hunter and gatherer ancestors.  He also draws from the few remaining hunter-gatherer societies to complete his  presentation.  The myths from these ancient societies served to harmonize  the life passages and circumstances which these people had to deal with,  and to bring the mind and the body into accord on these issues to create a  sense of aliveness and being to best suited to deal with these  circumstances.  As a result, these mythologies had a tendency to evolve  with the environments in which these tribes found themselves, the mythology  always incorporating the important aspects of the environment, such as game  animals.
He starts with our own stages of life and life passages that  ultimately must deal with our mortality, and then moves on to how these  tribespeople also had to deal with the life cycles and mortality of the  animals they encountered and upon which the depended for life.  In  archeological terms this begins with primitive burial sites.  Both the  burial sites of humans, and for sacrificial animals.  Throughout this  series of videos, we are visually brought into places of worship,  cathedrals and so forth.  It adds a depth of reality to the subjects  described.  Here, we are brought into the primitive cave sites for these  burials, and the accompanying paintings on them.  Campbell draws excellent  parallels and distinctions between these and the artwork and stained glass  of more modern cathedrals.
He moves on to the importance of ritual as an  enactment of the myth.  He draws on rituals relating to the hunt, passages  to manhood, and talks about how ritual dies and evolves.  The ritual  enactment draws the person into a sense of participation in the myth.  As  usual, Joseph Campbell's delivery, style, and the ability to draw us very  quickly into the powerful points of the metaphors that he uses, comes  across as enchanting and captivating.",958521600,11,2001,5.064814814814815
