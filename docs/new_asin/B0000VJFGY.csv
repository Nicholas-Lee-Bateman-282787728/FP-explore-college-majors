8003715,4,B0000VJFGY,"Hanover House's ""Classic Comedy Laugh-Pack"" DVD is an absolute must have for the advent comedy fan!!! This set contains four great film comedies on 2 Discs. Disc one is Abbott & Costello's 1949 classic AFRICA SCREAMS and Laurel & Hardy's THE FLYING DEUCES from 1939. Disc two contains the 1936 classic screwball comedy MY MAN GODFREY and a collection of three W.C. Fields shorts THE GOLF SPECIALIST (1930- his first talkie!),THE DENTIST (1932),and THE FATAL GLASS OF BEER (1933).The picture and sound qualities are superb,especially AFRICA SCREAMS and MY MAN GODFREY while THE FLYING DEUCES and the three W.C. Fields shorts don't fair as better. But nonetheless,it's a terrific set,but it's definately worth buying for AFRICA SCREAMS!!! Get this set and enjoy some funny and hilarious film comedies in the luxury of your own home!!",1073347200,7,831,5.162962962962963
