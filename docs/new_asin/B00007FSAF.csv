Shame on who ever made this dvd,you don't know what good soccer is. I was going to give it nothing but I couldn't. Oh im so pissed off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1089676800,,325,4.174603174603175
8311462,2,B00007FSAF,"First of all the movie is less than an hour long. $25 is just too much to pay for such a short film. Secondly, a lot of it is not even good, and the stuff that is good they show over and over again. The worst part of the movie is when they make fun of how people look. The commentator is not funny at all, and this part of the movie is completely lame.
There are not too many soccer DVDs, but whatever you do, stay away from this one.",1071187200,3,434,3.78021978021978
