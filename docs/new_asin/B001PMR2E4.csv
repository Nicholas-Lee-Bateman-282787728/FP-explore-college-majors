8644587,5,B001PMR2E4,"Beautifully and sensitively filmed against a backdrop of Montreal; a Jewish young man falls in love with a Lebanese Christian.  In contrast to previous films like  Torn Apart and David and Fatima , which tackled to thorny issue of Jewish and Arab love, this one doesn't take the easy way out, by killing off one of them.  The film allows for some possibility and maybe even a little hope that one-to-one the walls might  be torn down.",1427068800,,434,4.597402597402597
