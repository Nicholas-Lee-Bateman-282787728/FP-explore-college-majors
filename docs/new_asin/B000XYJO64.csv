8230282,5,B000XYJO64,I use tis in Nursery at church and the kids are glued to it. They count and say the numbers along with it and sing as well.,1490400000,,123,3.5925925925925926
8230283,5,B000XYJO64,"My 3 boys have all loved this video from babies until about 4 years of age.  Trust me, babies & toddlers don't notice it's not the same quality as Baby Einstein!  And, having watched it myself over and over through MANY sleepless nights, I feel qualified to say that it's really cute!  Most importantly, it's very soothing!  I'm disappointed that it's becoming so difficult to find because I love giving it as a baby shower gift.  I'll be keeping my copy when my kids outgrow it because it's helpful to have when I'm babysitting a fussy baby or toddler.",1435708800,,553,4.545454545454546
8230284,5,B000XYJO64,"My grandkids love this movie.  I already had one, but wanted one for their home.  My 20 mo. old granddaughter loves this movie and will sit all day and watch it.  It is very entertaining.  They go to different parts of the world and the kids sings in their native language and teaches them other cultures.  They have counting events in the movies and shows the colors in different language and it says them and you can learn to speak in another tongue.  Well worth it.",1398470400,,468,4.383720930232558
8230285,5,B000XYJO64,"I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he asks to watch it all the time. Little ones can learn so much from this video - counting, colors and about the beautiful world we live in.",1395705600,,185,3.8947368421052633
8230286,2,B000XYJO64,"Studies have shown that babies and small toddlers should be introduced to one language at a time or it stunts their development and makes it difficult for them to differentiate between the different languages--all the languages become on and they tend to use Spanglish or whatever mix of languages they've learned in one sentence. NOT helpful to a baby learning language. I thought there were just different versions for different languages, not everything combined in one. Sad, because the music and images are nice. :( I won't be letting my child watch this very often if at all.",1371427200,,581,4.938775510204081
8230287,4,B000XYJO64,"My children love this movie! Sure, it is lower budget and they probably could have gotten a better children's choir or something to sing the songs, but kids don't notice those things! This has been great for our family. I put it on on Sunday mornings to keep them busy while I am getting ready for church - it is a great help when your husband has early morning meetings! And it also teaches in several languages and repeats things. Toddlers love things repeated over and over. Over all, I totally recommend it!",1318723200,,511,4.505376344086022
8230288,3,B000XYJO64,"I was hoping there would be more of an LDS theme to this movie...or even just a religious theme.  It's kind of like the early Baby Einstein videos that had a lot of random items that had nothing to do with being a child of God.  I liked the ""Creation"" Baby Mormon video a lot better.",1263945600,,283,4.035714285714286
