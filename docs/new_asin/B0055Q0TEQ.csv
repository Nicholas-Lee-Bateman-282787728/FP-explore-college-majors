8458583,4,B0055Q0TEQ,"In some unidentified seaside city in Greece a taut cat-and-mouse game plays out between Jean-Paul Belmondo's breezy mastermind and Omar Sharif's enigmatic policeman, the point of contention: $1,000,000 in stolen emeralds. 1971's THE BURGLARS opens with a far-fetched tutorial on a nighttime jewel heist. Except, with the burglary in full swing, Mr. Azad (Belmondo) and his band of thieves are compromised when a policeman drives by and becomes suspicious of their parked automobile. Out steps Inspector Zacaria (Sharif), his bullsh-- radar pinging, his wardrobe resplendent. That's how it starts, with a roadside encounter between our two leads.

The next morning finds our thieves at the seaport, mightily concerned because their intended getaway ship is dry-docked for five more days, undergoing repairs from storm damage. Mr. Azad keeps it together, commands his accomplices to do this and that, all with a mind towards hunkering down and staying clear of the local constabulary. But what if the constabulary's already on the alert? Y'see, there's this omniscient quality about Inspector Zacaria. There isn't much more to the movie, plot-wise. Just Belmondo and Sharif's characters circling each other, trading in clever repartee.

If you're any sort of arthouse fiend, you're aware of French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, him what made his mark on films like Jean-Luc Godard's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breathless-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003UM8T3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breathless (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pierrot-le-fou-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B002EBRFCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pierrot le fou (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>] and Francois Truffaut's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mississippi-Mermaid/dp/B000053VBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mississippi Mermaid</a>. In THE BURGLARS Belmondo shares screen time with Omar Sharif. Their marvelous adversarial interplay is consistently one of the film's highlights, Belmondo flashing that twinkle in the eye, Sharif radiating a predatory gleam. They're such good foils for each other.

THE BURGLARS (a.k.a. Le Casse) is notorious for that rather spectacular extended car chase. It lasts maybe seven, eight minutes. The two automobiles spin and screech and careen into each other with astounding abandon. They negotiate the bustling city streets (sometimes backwards) and several flights of steps and even an oil spill. At the end Sharif's cop approaches Belmondo's crook and offhandedly remarks: ""You know there's a speed limit in this town."" Heh.

But you'd be selling this film short if you think that's the only exciting bit. THE BURGLARS is packed with expertly staged action set pieces, most of which showcases Belmondo's vaunted physicality. I couldn't help but marvel at the demanding stunts they let Belmondo perform. He leaps on top of cars and scales the sides of moving buses. He gets in a tremendous brawl with a romantic rival. One remarkable shot has Belmondo falling backwards away from the camera (and off a dump truck) and sliding down a mean slope onto a landfill, boulders sailing along. As an aside, in case you think that this display of athleticism is a one-time thing, take a peek at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-Man-From-Rio-L-Homme-De-Rio-with-ENGLISH-subtitles-Import/dp/B000OYZ04S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That Man From Rio / L' Homme De Rio - with ENGLISH subtitles (Import)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Professional/dp/B003JHXS6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Professional</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borsalino/dp/B00B76YKGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borsalino</a>. Even Jackie Chan says he wouldn't insure him.

It's a fun coat of artifice, a diverting two hours of make-believe. Throughout, there's a faster than scenic tour of whatever Greek city this is. I say ""faster than scenic"" because most of the time, Belmondo is too preoccupied with running from the law to stop and smell the moussaka. Still, he finds time to take in a rodeo and an erotic theater. At one point, he's in a vehicle on a microphone promoting a circus. You can get up to some weird things in that unnamed city. As Inspector Zacaria wryly observes: ""We're very lenient of foreigners as long as they don't go too far."" True that, creepy cop.

Dyan Cannon pops up as a hedonistic magazine model and Belmondo's potential love interest, although if you're sporting a cynical eye, you probably assume she's here because the suits required a known American actress to draw interest from the American audience. Nowadays, Cannon is known mostly for faithfully attending Laker games. Back in the day, she was stunning. However, the neatest scene with her in it - for me, anyway - involves her introduction of the Clapper to a delighted Belmondo.

8458584,4,B0055Q0TEQ,"Jean-Paul Belmondo was one of the few major French superstars to never really try to make it in America: the closest he came was with 1971's The Burglars aka Le Casse, which teamed him with regular director Henri Verneuil and Omar Sharif and Dyan Cannon, but even that was shot in Athens in both a French and English language version. Based on a novel by David Goodis, it's more of a glossy audience picture than a noir, the plot pared down to the bone along with the dialogue (though that didn't stop Tarantino borrowing some of it) while the stunts were played up. But what stunts, with an extensive car chase through the city, Belmondo hanging from a bus or tipped off a lorry down a steep slope into a landfill all the while making sure that we can see that it really is him putting life and limb on the line with the kind of reckless disregard for his own safety that Jackie Chan built a career on.

Sharif's corrupt cop who's after the emeralds Belmondo and his gang have stolen doesn't get to do anything quite so energetic but is on such charismatic form in the ensuing enjoyable game of cat-and-mouse that it's a pity he doesn't have more to do in the last third when things go a bit off the boil (there's also a bizarre injoke where, of the two stars, it's Belmondo rather than Sharif who plays an Arab!). He certainly fares better than Robert Hossein and, in particular, Renato Salvatori, who don't have much to do, or Cannon's topless model who distracts Belmondo and slows down the plot without quite shaking the feeling that she's just been written in to give the American co-producers a local name to promote. But while it's not perfect, it's definitely one of Belmondo's best crowd pleasers, making it hard to understand why it's been out of circulation for so many years: at present it's only available on DVD in Germany in a so-so 2.35:1 non-anamorphic widescreen transfer of the French-language version that suffers from excessive grain and a few moments of awkward edge enhancement but does at least have English subtitles.",1351555200,,2043,4.628099173553719
