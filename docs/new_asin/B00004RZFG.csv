7921553,5,B00004RZFG,Wish they would put this on DVD - I have it on VHS recorded off TV from long ago. I tried to get it put on a DVD for my private use but the place I took it too said it was Copywrited and that they couldn't do it. So I guess I have to get a VHS if I wanna watch it.,1438041600,5,264,3.2063492063492065
