8222008,5,B000WB0DUO,"This is the first anime I experienced and I was happy to own it finally, with all the extras as well.",1385942400,4,101,3.857142857142857
8222009,1,B000WB0DUO,"BEWARE!!!!!
There are some of these sets being sold for a very low price that are actually bootlegs which have compressed all of the episodes onto 9 DVD's and are the Japanese audio with english subs only versions.

Since this was never released in Japan under the Star Blazers name, you can rest assured the seller is selling fraudulent material.

Avoid this seller at all costs!!!!!!!",1281830400,15,386,4.833333333333333
8222010,5,B000WB0DUO,"I remember watching this show as I grew up during the 1980's and just happened to be going through our old VHS Tapes a few years ago updating the Family VHS Tapes List and came across a tape that had a few scenes from one of the episodes.  After that I looked online for this and not only found them at Amazon.com but found them to be watched online [...] under the keyword search of Space Battleship Yamato.  When I finished watching them online, I decided to get them to add to my collection of Anime/Cartoon shows, which also got me thinking of another Anime/Cartoon show from 1986 called ""Bionic 6,"" however, Amazon.com does not sell it.  But I will continue to look for it elsewhere online.",1252800000,9,695,4.456692913385827
8222011,5,B000WB0DUO,"If your a Starblazers fan this is definately worth the money spent. You get all 3 series at one price which is definately cheaper that buying them separately. The way that they structured the episodes when you hit the play all button is awesome too. No listening to the theme song at the begining of each episode (omg thank you!!), it goes right into the recap and the episode (great idea!! I wish more companies would follow suit).

Anyways as a series it was light years ahead of its time and even though the anime style is old it can still hang with any anime series out there today in terms of storyline and action. A great classic!!",1212451200,20,637,4.398305084745763
