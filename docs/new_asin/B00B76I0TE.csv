I will order more copies so I can share it with others (anyone) concerned about scriptural truth and end time chronology.

5560859,1,B00B76I0TE,"Don't waste your money on this film!  KJV or good modern translations of the Bible teach a pre-trib rapture.  By misleading people away from the pre-trib view, people will put off the day of salvation and be caught up unaware that they are in the tribulation.  I've only heard of Steve Anderson for less than a month and I've heard all I need to for a life time.  He's anti-government.  So is Kent Hovind who has been in jail since 2007 for tax evasion and is set to go on trial again 1 Dec 2014.  Don't be fooled by this film.  The Bible teaches there's a plan for the church - the rapture before the tribulation.  It is then that God will deal with Israel so that she will finally know who the Messiah is.

My main concern with the pre trib rapture teaching has always been that if wrong then there's going to be a whole lot of Christians out there deceived.

5560868,1,B00B76I0TE,"God bless you in the name of Jesus! Pastor Anderson is a quack! And I'm scoffing and mocking at the many reviews praising this film posted by pseudo-intellectuals and outright patsies. Alex Jones and Steven Anderson repeatedly hijack logic by asserting that even a five-year-old can read The Bible and conclude it teaches a post-tribulation pre-wrath Rapture, that the pre-tribulation Rapture isn't found anywhere in scripture, that those who actually believe in a pre -tribulation Rapture have ''itching ears'', It wasn't taught until A.D 1830, etc. etc. And they use one-size-fits-all exegesis by ''just always taking The Bible at face value''. Read 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, and Hebrews 5:12-14!!! Alex Jones and Pastor Roger Jimenez's accusations toward the Christians who believe in a Pre-tribulation Rapture appear to form the bedrock for this documentary. such are: ''it's a giant cop-out'' and ''Christians are laying down in the face of evil today due to this doctrine'' and ''this doctrine has made Christians indolent, complacent and apathetic. However, we should predicate our convictions upon truth, we should NOT predicate truth upon our convictions! Anderson's biggest thesis for his post-tribulation pre-wrath position is found in Matthew 24:29-31, Mark 13:24-27 and Luke 21:25-28, which do not refer to the Rapture because in these passages we read that God shall SEND HIS ANGELS with a great sound of a trumpet.......  The Rapture is God's snatching away the church with His own hand (Acts 8:39). There will be a pre-tribulation Rapture and a post-tribulation ''gathering together'' of the saints. The trumpet mentioned in Matthew 24 and Mark 13 is NOT the Last Trumpet, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 does not refer to Christ's second coming in judgment but rather to His second coming for His church in the pre-tribulation Rapture, the Great Tribulation is in fact God's wrath (Revelation 14:9-11), which includes the catastrophes sent by Christ to punish the entire world, and Revelation 22:20 teaches us that our LORD Jesus Christ may indeed return at any moment!!! It reads: He who testifies to these things says, surely I am coming quickly. Amen! Even so, come, Lord Jesus! The Greek word for 'quickly' is ''tachu'' meaning IMMINENTLY!!!!!!!!!!!  Also Revelation 4:1 Is the Rapture after all (Revelation 5:8-14). I used to be a post-tribulationist  and when I first watched Pastor Anderson appear on the Alex Jones show, I venerated him. But, since having researched his arguments I've found that almost everything he says is false and I am now a pre-tribulationist.  So to conclude, buy this DVD along with a cross-reference study Bible, a Strong's Exhaustive Concordance, as well as some Bible Handbooks. 2 Timothy 2:15!",1396396800,,2733,5.261467889908257
5560879,1,B00B76I0TE,"I bought this because I thought it would be an interesting take on the topic.  FAIL!  This pathetic fairy tale documentary centers around a young 30-something ""pastor"" in Tempe, AZ that never went to college and never went to seminary (a basic requirement to be a pastor these days).  Basically, this immature idiot (Steven L. Anderson) spends two hours insulting and mocking the per-tribulation people but does not do a very good job supporting his own beliefs.  I can't help but to point out that this little kid doesn't want to debate qualified pastors, the film only has he and another non-educated ""pastor"" (Roger Jimenez).  Most of the middle and end of the film does not even discuss pre-trib or pre-wrath trib viewpoints but gets into the New World Order (very basic level).  I would have to liken this film to a joke of a pastor (Anderson) that enlisted the film-making (Wittenberger) to tape him give some really bad sermons to the nine people in his church and Wittenberger bought in.  You, the potential purchaser, will have a better chance at a coherent pastor on a street corner than you will with this Anderson fellow.",1395878400,2,1133,4.779487179487179
5560880,5,B00B76I0TE,"Watch this documentary and pray about it and read the words of God.

Pre trib rapture is a lie designed to destroy the faith of lukewarm church goers, a false prophecy that shall fail.

Most preachers tell people what they want to hear for more members = more tithes = more money

This was a post I found on the tube and is not my work - but it says it all.

In Revelation 20:4-6 there are only 2 Resurrections spoken of:

4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the FIRST RESURRECTION.
6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the FIRST RESURRECTION:on such the SECOND DEATH hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

In the above scriptures, these are the Martyrs. John said ""this is the first resurrection."" John didn't say this is the ""second phase of the first resurrection,"" as pre-tribbers claim.
If this is the FIRST resurrection, can there be a resurrection before this one? Of course not, unless you want to ADD to the bible which is forbiidden!

The First Resurrection is of the dead in Christ and the Second is after 1000 years. Paul wrote that the Dead in Christ MUST rise FIRST, THEN we who are alive and remain will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.
1 Thessalonians 4:16-17
 16 ...and the dead in Christ shall RISE FIRST
 17 THEN we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them...

In Rev. 20:4-5, John sees the souls of Saints who were BEHEADED for refusing the Mark of the Antichrist during the Great Tribulation. John writes that they will rise and reign with Christ for 1000 years and that this is the FIRST RESURRECTION!

If according to John, the beheaded rise in the FIRST resurrection and Paul said those who are alive and remain are not caught up until AFTER the dead in Christ are resurrected, then this means the catching up or rapture takes place AFTER tribulation!

Now compare the above with 1 CORINTHIANS 15:20-23:
20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of those who slept.
21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
23 But every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits; AFTERWARDS THOSE WHO ARE CHRIST'S AT HIS COMING.
Notice only one resurrection of the dead in Christ is mentioned here! Which, according to Paul in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 must take place BEFORE we who are alive and remain are ""caught up"" with them!

When did Jesus say the dead in Christ would be resurrected?

John 6:39-40: Jesus said, ""This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up ON THE LAST DAY.

John 6:44: Jesus said, ""No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up ON THE LAST DAY.""

So if Jesus himself said the dead in Christ will be raised on the LAST DAY, and Paul said we who are alive and remain will not be caught up (raptured)  until AFTER the dead are raised, then where does a secret pretrib rapture fit in?

It does not fit in.",1389312000,3,3495,4.277693474962064
5560881,5,B00B76I0TE,"This has been a subject of my personal reading in the bible.  I don't have to be a theologian to understand God's word.  If someone anyone has an idea that goes against God's plain word that idea is heresy.  Religious or not you must agree with God for you don't have any other course if you want to have a glorious here after.  This book lays out the scriptures for a post-trib rapture.  There are no scriptures for a Pri-trib rapture.  The Pri-trib folks of which there are many, I was one of them who took a man's word over God's word.  God does not accept the person (position in the world) of man, cursed is the man who trusts in man.  This product does so much good as to save your soul from the heresy that could destroy your faith, and put you to sleep when the LORD said to stay awake and watch.

5560882,5,B00B76I0TE,"I had never heard of this movie until a friend of mine had recommended it to me after a long conversation about a series of books that I wrote on alchemy, I was instantly intrigued when I heard about this movie, I felt it was alchemy related and so I purchased the film, it was very informative, and an eye opener. it is a very good film and most definitely worth watching especially in these times. on a separate note, In 2008 I was sitting at my computer when the thought of the philosophers stone came to mind, I did a little internet research upon the subject and soon came across a very old eyewitness account of the world renowned alchemist Michael sendivogius performing a public transmutation of lead to gold in a previous century, immediately I was intrigued and I decided right then and there that I wanted to know more about his secret art, I embarked on a long journey into the fire as they call it, researching and studying the subject of alchemy with a focus upon the magnum opus, which entails both the white and red philosophers stones as well as aurum solis, the elixir of life. after a profound and extensive five year study into the matter, I have published eight short booklets upon the subject and I am currently preparing a dvd video on the matter which at this time is still in the production stage.

5560883,3,B00B76I0TE,"""After the Tribulation"" is a documentary directed by Paul Wittenberger, who also gave us ""The Great Culling"" and ""What in the world are they spraying"", two conspiracist documentaries. ""After the Tribulation"" is more overtly theological. It ties together conspiracist ideas about a One World Government with a Christian fundamentalist message. To all intents and purposes, the movie is really an almost two-hour sermon by Pastor Steven Anderson, backed up by Pastor Roger Jimenez and the more well-known ""Dr. Dino"" Kent Hovind (on a phone line from prison).

However, it's a fundamentalist message with a twist. Anderson and his colleagues reject the Pre-Tribulation Rapture doctrine (the ""Left Behind"" stuff) as a Satanic deception. Instead, he embraces the Post-Tribulation Pre-Wrath Rapture. To an outsider, the difference is pretty esoteric, as both sets of fundamentalists seem to believe in exactly the same conspiracy theories about the Anti-Christ creating a One World Government complete with microchips to control the population, etc. The main difference I could glean from the lectures is that Anderson believes that Christians will remain on Earth during the Great Tribulation, while the more popular Pre-Trib position asserts that they will be removed before it starts.

However, since Pre-Tribs presumably believe in a lot of *present* persecution, it's still not clear why this should be seen as a fundamental difference? Nor is it clear why Anderson believes that Pre-Tribs will be deceived by the Anti-Christ, since both they and Anderson himself define the Anti-Christ in exactly the same way: a future ruler who demands worship, unites the world's religions, persecutes Christians, implants microchips in the bodies of his followers, etc. The view of Israel and the Jews might be different, however, since Anderson forcefully claims that the Jews will accept the Anti-Christ as their Messiah. Perhaps wisely, this theme isn't expanded upon in ""After the Tribulation"".

Anderson is right that a Pre-Tribulation Rapture isn't mentioned in the Bible. But then, it's not entirely clear whether a futuristic Post-Trib Pre-Wrath Rapture is mentioned either, since in context the Book of Revelation deals with events during the history of the Roman Empire. The pastor really lost me when claiming that those who have faith in Christ will get to Heaven even if they commit murder and other heinous sins while alive on Earth (!!), while everyone else will go to Hell. If this is the message of the loving Christians, I can understand why the Anti-Christ succeeds in deceiving the rest of humanity!

""After the Tribulation"" is a good film if you are interested in evangelical-fundamentalist Bible exegesis, but probably not for the general audience.",1378598400,2,2757,5.375

5560914,5,B00B76I0TE,"You can debunk pre tribulation rapture doctrine pretty fast with 1 verse, Revelation chapter 1 verse 1 ""The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his SERVANTS things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:""
The revelation of the end times is given to the SERVANTS, who are the servants? the believers obviously. for all those who say that this revelation is for the unbelieving Jews that will be left behind or the servants are the Jews, well we keep reading and find out that in this same verse JOHN is called a servant too which proves that the book of Revelation are for the servants of Christ and not for the unbelieving Jews. you can't argue with scripture.

There is nothing biblical about the pre tribulation rapture, it is a hoax meant to put the believers into a state of sleep and carelessness(what do I care I am not gonna be here)
In this film pastor Anderson refers to scripture to prove that the pre trib rapture is a lie.
The movie explains everything very well and uses only biblical King James scripture to back his points.
If you show this movie to a pre trib believer and after he saw it he did not change his mind don't waste your time on trying to convince him, people who believe in the pre trib lie are blind because they chose to ignore the truth and live in ignorance.
God commands us to prepare and warn others, God put so much end time prophecy in the bible for a reason, it is not for the non believing Jews who burn the new testament let alone read and believe in what it say, thinking that all the end time prophecies in the bible were meant only for the Jews who are going to be here during the tribulation is selfish and stupid! it is meant for us this generation that lives right now right here, we are going to go through everything that is described there during the tribulation so we better prepare.

I highly recommend this film to any one who really seeks the truth and is open to it, I also suggest you watch pastor Anderson's ""pre tribulation moments"" on youtube they are just as great and very educational.

If you are a true believer and God has spoken to you while you were reading these words you understand how serious this is and for those of you who are willing to prepare I suggest you collect heirloom seeds that you can store for a long time and watch the movie back to eden at [...] to understand how to grow your own food God's way with minimal work and effort.

8563516,2,B00B76I0TE,"I have not yet seen this movie but already I can tell that it's inaccurate by the reviews because there's no mention of the scripture in Luke 21:36 about watching that ye may ESCAPE all these things. A mid and post tribulation rapture teaching is inconsistent with God's past actions of escape from His judgment recorded in the scriptures because He's the same yesterday today and forever. This is supported in the books of Genesis and Exodus with Noah and his family who were spared from the flood, Lot and his family spared from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and God spared the Israelites from the plagues that the Egyptians endured. Although God will pour out judgment on this earth, there's always a warning that precedes God's judgment which shows his character of mercy and grace. God wants His people to live a faithful holy life unto Him so that we could be ready for His coming as the bride of Christ mentioned in the book of Revelation 19:6-9,21:9. God wants His people to preach the gospel to unbelievers so that they could be saved.",1460332800,,1052,4.661290322580645

8563520,5,B00B76I0TE,"This film accurately makes the biblical distinction between the tribulation of the saints and the wrath of God. Dispensationalism is the tradition of men and has made the commandments of God void. Watch this presentation to see accurately the origins and history of the false pre tribulational rapture view and you will learn the historically biblical accurate pre wrath rapture view. Compare 1st Thessalonians 3:3-4 to first Thessalonians 5:9. As Christians we are not appointed unto wrath however we are appointed to tribulation. The first half of the 7 years is the wrath of the Dragon, or the tribulation of the saints while the second half of the 7 years is God pouring out his wrath on Satan's kingdom. watch this film to learn more.",1426377600,6,739,4.92
8563521,3,B00B76I0TE,"It's an excellent video with A LOT of biblical truth however the so called ""Pastor"" is cocky and very condemning. If he were a bit more humble this might be good to give out to those you know. Paul Wittenberger is not much better as I had contacted him regarding one of the women's water proof bibles that I purchased as the binding was imperfect. I will not be recommending this company to anyone. Follow the money people. There is no donation here as you have to pay regardless of your financial circumstances. A good ""Shepherd"" feeds his flock and takes care of them regardless of income. Ugh...",1421539200,,598,4.546296296296297
