8457018,5,B0054SF9FO,"Regarded with great affection by children of a certain age, the classic 80's/90's British television programme T-BAG has now been released on DVD, after years of tireless campaigning by the fans who'd never let it die.  One of the most imaginative series of it's time, T-BAG ran for nine seasons, each one a complete adventure in itself.  The basic premise was simple: a little girl would have to collect a certain series of magical objects in an effort to stop power-mad witch T-Bag from destroying the world.

Shortcake and sugar-cubes...she's back!  Moving her T-Room into the magic garden of a storybook, T-Bag (Elizabeth Estensen) is more powerful than ever, thanks to a larger T-Plant and the renewed services of T-Shirt (John Hasler), the only caddy who knows exactly how to brew up a good cuppa.  In order to hold on to her new powers, T-Bag has scattered the silver numbers from the town clock throughout the rest of the stories in the book.  Once again, it's up to Debbie (Jennie Stallwood) to ""think small"" and set about finding the lost numbers.  If she doesn't, the stories in the book will never end!

Filmed virtually on the heels of the first series, the second T-Bag adventure (T-BAG STRIKES AGAIN, 1986) has a richer look--the cardboard sets don't look as obvious because the whole thing is set inside a pop-up storybook--and the performances are much more assured.  Characters in this series include Prince Pimple and his unlikely princess Penelope Plumber, Ben and Bunty Badshot, Scrap Harry, Ali Barber, and Radio Riff-Raff disc jockey Long John Sylvia.

I have very fond memories of watching T-BAG as a child.  It was most often screened during school holidays here in Australia, and I used to have to arrange the rest of my holiday actitivies around the show!  I loved it so much - and still do.  To have the show on DVD is an absolute dream come true.  This DVD includes all 10 episodes from the series plus special audio commentaries also available on select episodes with Elizabeth Estensen, Jennie Stallwood and John Hasler.",1316995200,,2051,4.839541547277937
