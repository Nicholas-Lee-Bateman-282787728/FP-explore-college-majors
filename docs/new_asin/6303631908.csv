The sets  are great and the plot, which involves a primative society's fear or  technology, is filled with 'whodunnit' suspense.  The Ice Warriors are at  their best.  Ice Lord Izlyr especially comes across as one of the strongest  and most interesting alien characters the programme has seen.  A true  classic.",966643200,12,444,5.318840579710145

It also shows for the first time Alpha Centurai(Why does everyone else who reviewed this story seem to hate  him/her! ) As this story was practically entirley filmed underground the  quality of the recording isn't great but it was made in the 1970's!

698202,4,6303631908,"This Jon Pertwee story is very enjoyable. It is well designed and directed, has terrific costumes and a real medieval atmosphere. It's also very well written. Allegedly (or as most analyses of the story purport)  ""The Curse of Peladon"" is a commentary on the UK's proposed entry  into the Common Market. The writer's politics must clearly have been in  favour of joining with Europe for him to liken England to a backward planet  deciding to embrace the ""progress"" of joining the galactic  Federation, which is portrayed as a Star Trek type conglomeration of  planets. However, this is a story that can be enjoyed independent of such a  context. What you have is partly a tale of court intrigue combined with a  political thriller, which becomes more complex as the story progresses. The  involvement of the Doctor and companion Jo Grant opens a can of worms - he  is forced to impersonate a delegate overseeing whether Peladon is fit to  join the Federation, while Jo must masquerade as a Princess. Small factors  such as these escalate the situation; by the start of the final episode,  political machinations have never been more gripping. The diplomatic  nuances are a credit to Brian Hayles's skill as a writer. The return of his  monsters, the Ice Warriors, is also good to see. Alan Bennion and Sonny  Caldinez perform their second of three double acts as Ice Lord and Warrior;  the decision to portray them as allies rather than as conquering alien  ""baddies"" as they have been before is also a clever move. The  Doctor is forced to question his prejudices about them. Bennion's  performance as the Ice Lord is wonderful - he makes the character likable,  honourable (especially when he announces the debt he owes to the Doctor)  and quite suave. The alien designs of Alpha Centauri and Arcturus are  interesting, even if a little simplistic by today's standard of what aliens  should be. The two main Peladonian characters are also well presented. King  Peladon, played by David Troughton (son of Patrick), could be criticised  because of his effeminacy and indecision (a ""wet fish"" as Jo  calls him), but he is a young ruler, lonely at the top and has to make some  difficult decisions. His romantic inclinations towards Jo, while hardly  touching, don't fall into the mushy zone. Hepesh is perhaps the most  intriguing character. He is the story's antagonist, but his opposition to  joining the Federation is not presented as evil. He DOES represent the  conservative view, opposed to progress, but he is simply a man of his  convictions. (I'm not sure whether the opponents of change in the story's  wider context are meant to be as sympathetically presented as Hepesh - I  don't think so.) ""The Curse of Peladon"" can be enjoyed both in  and out of context. It is a gripping drama, visually pleasing and very  classy production.",959040000,15,2840,4.878406708595388

698286,5,6303631908,"In 2014, I made a goal for myself...to watch all 50 years of Doctor Who; every available serial, episode, movie, and special...and I gave myself one year to do it. It took eight months, but I eventually achieved my goal, and just in time for the 50th anniversary special. I then decided to buy/own my absolute favorite serials/episodes from each Doctor, and this was one of them.

This story took place during the story arc where the Third Doctor was banished to Earth by the Time Lords. While taking a test flight in the TARDIS, the Doctor and Jo Grant land on the planet Peladon. When they are mistaken for representatives from Earth, the Doctor finds himself involved in the committee of alien delegates assessing Peladon's petition to join the Galactic Federation (an organization made up of people from many different planets, similar to the Federation on Star Trek). When one of the King's advisors is killed, the High Priest fears the ancient Curse of Aggedor is at work, but the Doctor suspects his old enemies, the Ice Warriors (who are part of the delegation) are to blame. Can the Doctor and Jo discover who the real enemy is before a diplomatic incident plunges everyone into war?

Like I said in the title, this serial, oddly enough, plays out like a live action episode of Scooby Doo; complete with a ""haunted house/castle"" set up, secret passageways, a monster on the loose, and a bad guy hidden amongst the gathering--someone you'd least suspect. Doctor Who's long been a champion of teaching tollerance and acceptance of other races and cultures, and this serial is one of the stronger examples. In this case, it would've been so easy to cast the Ice Warriors as the villains, but not only do they break our expectations, but the Doctor himself has to learn to put his disdain for his former enemies behind him when they turn out to be more than honorable. Even the actual ""monster"" lurking the castle turns out to be more than meets the eye. And Jo Grant's brief romance with the King is both touching, as well as bitter sweet, when she, unfortunately, can't stay with him. And Alpha Centauri, the giant, talking eyeball, is great for a chuckle or two.

The picture quality is pretty good, considering when this was made, and the disc is loaded with a ton of interesting special features, including episode commentaries from the actors, and behind the scenes info about the serial.

Bottom line, this is a great little ""who done it"" mystery adventure, with more than a few twists and turns, and characters who will teach you the age old lesson of not judging a book by its cover. Easily my favorite Third Doctor story.",1430092800,2,2636,4.711496746203904

698375,4,6303631908,"This is the first of the two Third Doctor stories set on the Planet Peladon. This world is a seemingly primitive planet that is being asked to join the Galactic Federation. The Doctor and Jo are mistaken for the delegates from Earth after the TARDIS lands there, then falls down a cliff. This story features palace intrigue involving both the natives and the galactic delegates. There is an interesting point in that the Ice Warriors are delegates, and the Doctor has to overcome his prejudice of their species and work together with them. The rest of the aliens present are a bit less than optimally realized, with pretty rubbery appearances and gratingly pitched voices. However, this is Doctor Who after all, and a pretty decent story allows one to overlook such shortcomings. It should be mentioned that the other Peladon story isn't a direct sequel to this one as it is set in a different time period, and therefore can be watched independently of this one.",1376179200,,962,4.801204819277109

698377,3,6303631908,"The Peladon stories (first ""The Curse of Peladon,"" followed by ""The Monster of Peladon"" two seasons later) are fondly remembered by many Who fans for their menagerie of imaginative alien creatures and lively, action-driven plotting, but it's an enthusiasm I have difficulty sharing. I've always found the stories' setting dark and claustrophobic, and the action feels cramped. The Peladon stories could almost have been performed on radio without losing much in the translation.

""Curse"" is notable for reintroducing the Ice Warriors as a reformed, peace-loving race that now eschews war for a leading role in a growing Galactic Federation (they return to characteristic, evil form in ""Monster""), but the other aliens in these stories are hard to take. First, the hermaphroditic hexapod from Alpha Centauri (who appears in both ""Curse"" and ""Monster"") is screechy and annoying, a one-eyed green monstrosity that must wear living-room curtains around its neck to cover up the unnatural juncture of its head with its stalklike body. The design of Arcturus in ""Curse"" is equally preposterous, a primitive puppet head inside a transparent dome attached to a machine body--he's basically a Dalek with the organic bits visible on the outside. The ""monster"" of Peladon, fear of which drives so much of the action in both stories, is essentially a man in an ape suit with the head of Alf whom the Doctor easily tames with hypnosis and Venusian lullabies.

Both stories revolve around the struggles of Peladon's weak monarchs to maintain rule in the face of, first, a double-dealing High Priest in ""Curse"" and then sex discrimination and a miners' rebellion in ""Monster."" In ""Curse,"" you either warm to the supposed chemistry between King Peladon (played by David Troughton, son of Patrick) and Jo Grant (Katy Manning) or you don't (I didn't). I found Peladon's daughter and heir, Queen Thalira (Nina Thomas), in ""Monster"" an empty cipher, and Sarah Jane's feminist exhortations for her to step up to power sound hopelessly dated now.

The Special Features accompanying ""The Curse of Peladon"" include the first part of an extensive if somewhat overblown ""making of"" documentary on both Peladon stories (beware of spoilers that give away elements of ""The Monster of Peladon""); a quite thorough and enjoyable retrospective on the Ice Warriors; and a look back at the memorable collaboration of Jon Pertwee and Katy Manning as the Third Doctor and companion Jo Grant.",1303516800,5,2454,5.191919191919192
698466,5,6303631908,"""The Curse of Peladon"" is a story that encourages critical thinking skills.
While watching this tale, you consider different cultures, as well as thoughts
about war and peace between planets. One of the reasons I enjoy Doctor Who shows is
because good wins out over evil.",1276387200,,271,4.913043478260869
698467,5,6303631908,"""The Curse of Peladon"" is great fun. The Doctor and Jo take a test flight in the TARDIS, but are intercepted by the Time Lords, and arrive on the planet Peladon which is entering the mighty Galactic Federation. But all is not well, the King's advisor is killed in mysterious circumstances. The High Priest believes it's a warning from the great god Aggador that this entering into the Federation should not take place. However, the Doctor believes otherwise. There is a conspiracy at work on Peladon to prevent its entry. The Doctor suspects the alien delicates from Mars, his old enemies, the Ice Warriors. But are they the real culprit?

Although the story is kind of a cheap one, the script and acting is so well done that it keeps you hooked from begining to end. This story has everything in it - murder, conspiracy, mystery, action, drama, a palace revolution, and some humorous moments too. And many parts in it also reminded me of ""Star Trek"" and ""Flash Gordon"" so you know this has to be a good one. Highly recommended!",1275523200,,1028,4.648351648351649
698468,4,6303631908,"""The Curse of Peladon"" is a prime specimen of vintage ""Doctor Who"" from the early 1970's. On one level, it functions as a recognizably faithful example of the quintessentially British murder mystery (""Hound of the Baskervilles"" in fact easily comes to mind) but skillfully displaced into the sci-fi genre and somewhat warped thereby. The oddly medieval planet Peladon stands poised either to join a galactic federation and so pitch its interests with the wider universe or else pursue an isolationist course and turn in upon itself. Right at this critical juncture the young and inexperienced Peladonian king's advisor in favor of the alliance is found dead under mysterious circumstances, of course, at which point the Doctor and Jo inadvertently wander into the situation, their impromptu decisions in response to this tense environment of complicated political entanglements serving to thicken the plot ever further. So who is the culprit? One of the colorfully diverse and unforgettable federation delegates (including some prior enemies, the Ice Warriors), the king's rather xenophobic high priest, or (as the latter claims) the offended zoomorphic deity Aggedor himself? The plausibly motivated and believable conflicts and concords among these unusual suspects marks one of the chief strong points of this story--just as the fact that the answer is clumsily revealed rather sooner than necessary, defusing the suspense somewhat, is one of its weakest. That said, the subsequent twists and turns (including a botched coup d'tat) keep the viewer engaged regardless.

On a more general level, this tale is at its core a strongly felt parable in favor of the values of science and progress along with the open-mindedly receptive attitude to the universe this entails. This dovetails with a notable tendency in ""Doctor Who"" more generally. After all, one of the initial purposes of the program was to educate youngsters in the wonders of science (and history). Sadly this noble aim has often been regrettably undercut by the writers' shaky grasp of scientific concepts and terminology (the recurring misuse of the word ""constellation"" for instance). Even at its most giddily inaccurate, though, the show's basic attitude towards science as an abstract ideal has remained firmly in force as an undercurrent. Here in ""The Curse of Peladon"" however this orientation is dramatically foregrounded and given probably its most vociferous and unambiguous expression in the history of the show. How they manage to do this in a way that's vastly entertaining and enjoyable rather than drearily preachy and pedantic is, perhaps we should say, just an inexplicable part of the alchemy of this perennial science fiction classic.",1273622400,,2717,5.3629976580796255
698469,4,6303631908,"I'm an unabashed fan of the Pertwee era of Dr. Who.  He brought a uniqueness to the role that no one has ever been able to replicate, and was able to salvage many episodes on the strength of his charm.  I have liked this episode since I first saw it over 25 years ago.  It is one of the most endearing episodes of Pertwee's run.  I can't put my finger of why, but every time I watch it, it just makes me smile.  Highly recommended viewing",1268092800,6,438,4.046511627906977
698470,4,6303631908,"After ditching poor Captain Mike Yates, with whom Jo has a date, for a test flight of the TARDIS with the Doctor, the pair end up on a cliff face. They then scale a excellently sculpted miniature mountainside to the ""Citadel of Peladon. Here they fuel a case of mistaken identity, always a great time saver (like the 2005 invention of the psychic paper), once assuming their roles of the Earth delegates the two are able to immerse themselves in the court conspiracy on a galactic scale. First, Peladon is a planet under a feudal monarchy applying for admission to ""Galactic Federation"" (no, not that ONE), an application with delegates from Alpha Centauri, Arcturus, and Mars are assessing whether or not to accept Peladon's entry. The good but young King Peladon is torn, his Chancellor Torbis urges towards progress, to bring the Planet from superstitions beliefs, while High Priest of Peladon Hepesh is worried that the ancient ways and traditions will lost with the Federation membership. But the mysterious murder of the Chancellor, is interpreted by the High Priest to be a sign of disapproval from the spirit of the Royal Beast of Peladon, Aggedor.

In a very Agatha Christie style ""drawing room mystery"", we have the Good Doctor and the usual suspects or delegates. Interestingly enough some bigotry influences the Doc's judgment. The Doctor immediately suspects Ice Lord Izlyr, let's be fair, the Ice Warriors in all previous encounters HAVE attempted world domination. So when someone attacks the Arcturus delegate, and some superficial evidence also pointing to this, the Doctor is onboard with the theory. Meanwhile an equal mistrust of  the Ice Warriors themselves towards ""Princess"" Jo evolves inpart because of the young King Peladon's instant attraction for her, and partly his mother's Earthly origins (also an angle Peladon uses to talk game to Jo), also in their eyes any possible union gives unfair political weight in Federation affairs. All are but pawns in some devious political game...What sinster secret lays behind the killings? Is Aggedor seeking his revenge? Maybe, But more importantly, Jon Pertwee's Doctor is at his best here as the courtly King's counselor filling the void left by Torbis' death, lending his sagely advise to an inexperienced king. Also coming to DVD for May the improved sequel aired the following season The Monster of Peladon, in which the Doctor an Sarah return 50 years later to more treacherous plots.

Influences of this story arc, other than Shakespeare's histories there are strong similarities to the Classic Star Trek episode ""Journey to Babel."" In turn it may have influenced some Babylon 5 stories as well.

Another important (atleast to me) note: the voice of Alpha Centauri  played by Ysanne Churchman  worked as an actress on British radio, TV and film (returns as the Voice of Alpha Centauri in The Monster of Peladon and to voice the Spiders in Planet of the Spiders). She is my favorite thing about all three stories, de-lightful!

Great bits.... Delagate from Alpha Centauri's high pitched voice may be nearly enough to distract away from the fact that the costume looks like a man-sized one-eyed-member...other high points...the Doc sings the ""monster"" Aggedor to sleep,  the ""Venusian"" lullaby the Doctor uses in The Daemons. Here, the Doctor uses the tune of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen""

Another neat fact David Troughton, young King Peladon here, is really the son of the second Doctor, the late Patrick Troughton, but you'd know him as the Prof.  in season four's MIDNIGHT, if they new series ever needs a 2nd Doctor stand-in, David is perfect (with a wig & a recorder).

Peladon Drinking Game.....Drink whenever:

-King Peladon flirts with Princess Josephine of TARDIS.

-King Peladon proposes to Princess Josephine of TARDIS

-Princess Josephine of TARDIS spurns said flirting & proposal attempts.

-The Doctor calls someone ""Old Chap"" or ""My Dear Fellow.""

-The Doctor or Jo are accused of murder or threatened with execution or just ""seized""(it happens quite a lot in these stories, doesn't it? )

-The King is taken hostage.

-ALPHA CENTAURI speaks (let's face it, that voice! You gotta have a drink!)

-Aggedor shows up, whether it be to maul or purr (shrine statues count, too)...""Here's to Aggedor....cheers!""",1266624000,7,4295,5.101283880171184

698472,5,6303631908,"I had watched both ""Peladon"" stories in H.S.(thats in 1986 or something) and had forgotten much of it until I got ""Monster"" retail and have watched it for the last ten years.  I had gotten this the other day from a third party vendor for purpose of continuety alone, but was expecting the quality here to be no better, I was totally wrong!  Despite the cold fish rulers(Queen Thalira and King Peladon), this was actually a good story and the plot much more viable and the relations of Jo (Josaphine) and the King was quite a tear jerker. Had ole doc dropped her off here...  Alpha Centuri was much less annoying(than in Monster), Arcturus was an interesting additon not in the sequal(he was killed) I liked arcturus, and so did Commander Alyzxer in his comment ""I prefer arturous' cold logic over the shrill ravings of Alpha Centuri!"" don't we all!!! (sounds worse than Rush's Geddy Lee singing ""Bastile Day"" at the 1975 New Jersy concert!).  The lack of funds(I assume-how could I not?!) made Monster a monstrocity, but ""Curse"" has those seams tightened and those production and direction values in good form and professionally polished.  Director of both films was a man that seems to get much praise from the actors in other DVD commentary(this being VHS) Lennie Mayne.  Alaxzyr is still played by the same actor and his martain lungs explain that annoying asmatic breathing habit.  Logic dictates he wear a mouth peice as his henchmen do.  The wheezing was toned down in ""monster"" but ""good ole Alpha"" was thrice as annoying!  Yzanne Churchman has a surprisingly good career(Webkipedia.com) but the tired direction and producton in her A.C. performance just wasn't there(in Monster but somewhat tollerable here).  The complicated delegate mission(alien get together) was very like the Star Trek Next Gen formula and quite belevable in ""Curse"" as opposed to the boarish attempt in ""monster"" and that ridiculous Vega ""who was a simple-minded minor from the planet of his namesake, who didn't believe in the Aggordor trickery"" then jumping in front of the Aggordor immage to prove his point. Jon Pertwee is always in a fight, but this time with The King's Champion it was somewhat entertaining as opposed to a ""going through the motions as Pertwee must be in at least one fight per show"" formula as it was with Ettis the bafoonish minor with bi-polar's disorder. Curse is interseting to watch and not like Monster, it has you glued hard enough to your seat until the end.  Mostly the Josaphine and Peladon relations. And the backstories not in Monster.  At the end, the true Earth Delegate makes her cameo(she later appeared in ""Time Warrior"") saying ""Doctor... Doctor Who?!!""  A Barry Lets no! no!  And sure to get an earfull from the muscle brained know-it-all, Terrence Dicks(he seems a loud voice in Doctor Who as Harlem Elison is over here in owr own sci fi drivel).  I can't wait for the DVD commentary on this one!(""Curse of Barry Lets!"" ""The Monster who is ""Terrence Dicks""!)",1193529600,,2984,4.8579881656804735
698473,3,6303631908,"First watched this in '84(made in 1972 not 75).  And it happened to be on a stormy day(in my local area) at about 5:00 in the afternoon(oddball schedual for PBS in my area)  My eigth grade mind was dazzeled by the many monsters which unlike most of Pertwee's all seemed to congregate to one little descolate planet.  Peladon(means Volcano land or something like it).  I do not have it on VHS nor have I recorded it at the time, yet I remember my final veiwing well, in H.S. Feb 27 1987 when it cancelled here in OK USA.  Most shows had ""humanoid aliens"" but this had what other worlds would have(without rideculous co-incodence).  The martians(Ice Warriors) Arcturans, and the Eye-guy though I find him annoying in my VHS copy of ""MOnster Of Peladon"" at the time he was just another alien. David Thoughton was the ""King"" of Peladon and was either named after his planet or visa versa.  Kings and Queens are a staple hierchy on other planets in artistic fanciful sci-fi of the 70's(and in re-ality in England). We find that the TARDIS is indistructible for the first time(rack up another for the trivia nerds).  If I were in the cloister room farting off my brain with meditition, I would be mildly retarded(you flip inside the box as in Peter Davison's Tegan Jovanka piloting the beast revealed, no artificila centrif-grav dampeners in this pile of turtle dung.).  Jo Grant is an amazing mountain climber for a silly science apprentice who trips on her feet every five seconds on flat ground, her role in the ""stealth"" profession(another genre in-joke) is meanial but cute.  ""Princesse"" Josephine and the ""Doctor"" humor thier king and countrymen(as in ""Aurther"", Galwain, Bradwin, Lancie and so on) for a while and get thrust under the pig-snout of the ""Monster of Peladon"" Aggador(craggy dark).  And the murdur-mystery in a bazzaarland of varing aliens begins afoot! This is a ""who dunnit"" in space.  Batman and Robin could be so cheezy.(Luv it!)

Pel is Hell,and I assumea post-appocolyptic varient of an Earth-like world as venus or the Anakin Skywalker fall from grace place. I jokingly call Nina Thomas(in the successor throne as Queen Thalira) la Nina el Tempus Het Har Diablo(Lady Twin of Storms the Flame haired Devil) reflecting owr current environment trends, not the actress.  No offense, but isn't it ironic?  And she seemed so nice. Nat Portman's Amadala does too, you get killed that way you know.

Anyway(s) the Pel chronicles the events on a single planet instead of the grandios ""Galaxy Five"" War or the ""Galactic Federation"" which were supposed to be events happening around this tiny and insignificant planet of a single and simple Pleblo dwelling-like city in the face of a rock where storms brewed in a desert wasteland and I picture it looks much as the Darth Vader planet Korriban, thouhg outside the ""Citidel"" for lack of a better name, is not part of the stories. The store is good, the acting on the major players is pretty good too.  The loosely based directing is somewhat bad as usual in DW.  This is not the base of DW though that title goes to Tom Baker story Horns of Nimon, though I like that one too, it is, I agree, campy as a rank tent made of cotton in the rain and as this was, is sloppily directed.(""This"" as being monster of peladon, though I assume ""this"" is the same as I remember the quality in 1984-7). Still campy is fun to watch good times.  ""Buck up!"";;/",1151884800,2,3401,4.704890387858347
698474,4,6303631908,"In this story, the Doctor and Jo mistakenly land on the ledge of a windy mountainside, and enter the citadel of Peladon.  There, they are mistaken (and quickly assume the role of) the Earth delegate.  Peladon is a planet under a feudal monarchy applying for admission to the Galactic Federation, and the delegates from Alpha Centauri, Arcturus, and Mars are assessing whether or not to accept Peladon's entry.  The Doctor is the chairman delegate while Jo becomes Princess Josephine of TARDIS, a royal observer.
Even though Peladon's Grand Council decided for Federation membership, there's a clash of ideals.  Chancellor Torbis is for progress, to bring Peladon out of primitive superstition, while the high priest Hepesh is worried that the ancient traditional ways will be swept away, with Peladon being a slave to the Federation.  Torn between the two is the young and weak-minded king, also named Peladon, who was raised by both men.  He is all for joining the Federation, but Torbis's mysterious murder is the first of many crises to arise.  Hepesh believes it's a sign that the spirit of Aggedor, the royal beast of Peladon, is angry.  With Torbis dead, Hepesh solely has the king's ear.  The Doctor puts the problem before the king neatly:  ""Your majesty is an enlightened ruler, but who will your people believe, King Peladon or Aggedor?""
Many crises occur in this episode, including two attempted murders.  And Hepesh is dead set on keeping Peladon the way it is, and to that end, he sees the Doctor, who is the chairman delegate, as his foremost enemy, and conspires to have him killed, or fearing reprisal from the Federation, expelled.  Yet the Doctor decides to stay on and help the besieged king while solving the mystery of whether Aggedor is a ghost or a manifestation that's ""solid hairy fat.""
Of the delegates, the Doctor mistrusts the Ice Lord, Lord Izlyr.  After all, the Ice Warriors,  who in both previous encounters, tried to conquer Earth, so it's no surprise that he suspects them when someone attacks the delegate from Arcturus, plus Jo finds evidence pointing to that.  Yet the Ice Warriors mistrust Jo because of the attraction Peladon has for her, and because Peladon's mother was from Earth, think that a possible marriage has political ramifications, giving Earth an edge in Federation affairs.  And the Federation cannot override local laws, so there's a legal roadblock as well.
Peladon (the king) becomes smitten with Jo and wants to marry her, but Jo, though fond of him, stands firm as a neutral observer.  Later, when the Doctor's life is in danger, she abandons all restraint and pleads with the king to save him, yet he is torn again by being loyal to the laws of the planet and his feelings for Jo.
This story was influenced by Britain's entry into the Common Market, and it's not at all bad.  The delegates are creatively realized, but the high-strung but pacifistic Alpha Centauri is my favourite.  Due to the body shape of this green hermaphrodite hexapod, with a round face that's one giant eye, it was referred to director Lennie Mayne as a ""giant green d--k.""  A yellow jacket covered it for the story, but it was referred to as the ""d--k in the jacket.""  Its high-pitched feminine voice which becomes hysterical also gives it personality.  Other influences include Star Trek's ""Journey To Babel"" episode, and as for Aggedor, the Hound of the Baskervilles is an apt comparison.
And the lullaby the Doctor uses was originally spoken in the story The Daemons.  Here, the Doctor croons it, using the Christmas carol ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" as a melody.
David Troughton (Peladon) is the son of the second Doctor, Patrick Troughton, and later appeared as Egan in the Stranger series.
This story is either regarded as one of the best or worst of the Jon Pertwee era.  I see it as inbetween, definitely not the worst, but good, not great.  Its sequel, The Monster Of Peladon, is actually better.",1074384000,4,3941,4.855007473841555
698475,3,6303631908,"I admit it. I am not a fan of the Peladon stories.
This makes this review a little harder to write but not impossible.
To me the two Peladon stories of third Doctor Jon Pertwee mark the nadir of Doctor Who other than the Colin Baker stories.
In this one the Doctor arrives on Peladon and is mistaken as the delegate from Earth in the forthcoming peace conference between the Galactic Federation and the planet Peladon.
A series of murders, attempted murders and other incidents is attributed to the symbol of the planet, Aggedor.
The Doctor, as usual, gets involved, is blamed, cleared and saves the day but even so cannot save this adventure.
The concept is OK, the alien Alpha Centauri, male with tentacles and a female voice who is continually panic stricken, is silly, the Ice Warriors are wasted and the Doctor singing to the horned monster shows that he should not give up his day job.
Still it is OK for younger viewers.",1034121600,5,927,4.590361445783133

The Doctor is marvelous in this episode. He has an air of easy authority that makes him slot right in as the Chairman of the Commission. We also get to see the physicality of the Third Doctor in a brilliant fight scene in episode three.

Katy Manning was also very good, showing great chemistry with the Doctor as well as some very believable reactions to being mistaken for a princess. Her costume for the episode is particularly effective.

The story also makes brilliant use of the Ice Warriors, suggesting a different side to the species and giving them a degree of complexity that surpasses other Doctor Who ""monsters."" There's a nice bit of political intrigue and the Doctor singing a bit.

Overall, a very fun and satisfying story that, at four episodes, doesn't overstay its welcome.",1500249600,,1068,4.949720670391062
