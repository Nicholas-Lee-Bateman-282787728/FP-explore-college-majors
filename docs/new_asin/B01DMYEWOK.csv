8756436,1,B01DMYEWOK,Choppy story that just never really develops the back stories of the athletes that well - as a result the intended drama with the key athletes never really engages.  Sophomoric effort at best.,1481932800,,192,4.818181818181818
8756437,5,B01DMYEWOK,"A must see for cycling enthusiasts this sharply focused documentary defines the cliche ""old college try"" propelled by displays of perseverance and teamwork.",1479859200,2,156,5.826086956521739
8756438,5,B01DMYEWOK,"Anyone who enjoys bike racing, this is the purest example. IU's Little 500 is an annual race pitting 33 teams of women and 33 teams of men in two races in April. The documentary follows several teams as the practice and prepare for the races.

While plenty of drama evolves, what you see are outstanding college students who are biking for joy. The Little 500 is one of the nation's largest sporting events both in participation and single day attendance.

If you have not been to Bloomington for the race, One Day in April will have you consider attending for the race this coming April!",1471392000,3,588,4.59047619047619
