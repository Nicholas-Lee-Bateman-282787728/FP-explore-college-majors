2062725,4,B000255LFC,"Kenneth is a single bachelor who can't score with the ladies.  It's not that he's a bad-looking guy really, he's just painfully shy and has no clue as to how to speak to members of the opposite sex.  Kenneth has a crush on Lisa, a typist who he works with, but cannot bring himself to ask her out on a date.  One day Kenneth sees an ad for ultra-realistic love dolls and chooses to purchase one for the sum of $10,000.  He names the doll Nikki and customizes it to look exactly like Lisa, everything from body dimensions, to hair, make-up, lipstick, etc.  Kenneth does everything with the doll; dining, dancing, movie-watching, kissing, intercourse.  As his infatuation with the doll increases, so does his work relationship with Lisa and soon him and Lisa are actually dating each other.  But within this love triangle someone is bound to become jealous and either Lisa or Nikki is gonna have to go...
Throughout the first half of the film I didn't even realize I was watching a horror film, it felt more like your routine drama picture.  Kenneth's sense of loneliness and isolation is well-developed and we are made to sympathize with him and hope that he finds happiness and love.  Then after a while, things take a turn for the worse as Kenneth turns into an absolute degenerate sicko right before our eyes.  The film becomes increasingly dark as the minutes go on, leading to its blood-soaked ending. This is an example of a movie that chronicles the madness and despair that can be caused by loneliness.  Comparisons to the film ""May"" are inevitable except that May Cassidy was someone we sympathized with throughout the entire picture.  Towards the end of this film however you will come to loathe Kenneth.
""Love object"" is a well-executed and engaging film.  The acting by the two leads is first-rate especially for a straight-to-video release.  Not to mention the delicious supporting role performances of Rip Thorn and genre veteran Udo Kier.  Despite the outrageous central premise, the film has a very serious tone.  It is haunting and disturbing not so much due to traditional horror movie scares but rather because of its unflinching realism.  For those who live in apartments and live the single bachelor lifestyle, some of this stuff will really hit home on a personal level.",1090108800,,2291,4.803571428571429
2062726,4,B000255LFC,"Isn't it nice to actually stumble on a small movie and enjoy it way more than you expected? Here's your movie. It's creepy. It's actually laugh-out-loud funny in places. The acting is suprisingly good. And, well, the whole thing just works really well.
There are little pieces of ""Frankenstein"", ""Reanimator"" and ""Magic"" dropped here and there, but it really is it's own original idea. One sentence synopsis: A lonely, work-obsessed guy buys a $10,000 sex doll and things really go wrong from there....

It starts slow, it progresses without logic...there is nothing to discuss about this movie but plenty to mention what's missing.
The producer is trying to convince me that main character is mental case--I don't think so. The mental case here is government who outlaw sex and expect their subjects be asexual and behave like robots. Sure, in their dreams, maybe.
The storyline is quite linear for whatever reason and, on a top of insult, sex part done for kids below age of twelve.

2062729,4,B000255LFC,"<strong>Love Object</strong> (Robert Parigi, 2003)

Warning: <em>Love Object</em> is not at all the film you think it is.
Anti-warning: it's about a dozen times better.

Parigi, a prolific TV producer, took a single crack (to date) at doing the writer-director thing. The film made the rounds of festivals, where it was accepted and screened at both Cannes and Tribeca (both notoriously competitive), then got an extremely limited NYLA theatrical run in early 2004 before going to DVD. Critics split on the movie along, mostly, the predictable lines: the horror kids dug it and realized this is actually a really low-key flick, while the more mainstream critics savaged it. (Two notable exceptions: the movie garnered favorable reviews from the <em>LA Times</em> and <em>Chicago Tribune</em>.) Ebert credits the movie with/blames it for ""grisly sadism""; what movie was he watching? Not this one.

Plot: Kenneth Winslow (<em>Dexter</em>'s Desmond Harrington) is a writer of technical manuals, a geek who spends his time at home eating takeout pizza when he's not being an exemplary employee much-beloved of his boss (the inimitable Rip Torn). All is well until Lisa Bellmer (<em>The Guardian</em>'s Melissa Sagemiller), a new temp, slightly klutzy, slightly frumpy, and preternaturally beautiful, enters the workplace. Kenneth is smitten, but has no clue how to approach the girl of his dreams. So instead of asking her out, after he comes upon an ad hocking life-size rubber dolls (think RealDoll in the real world, and remember this movie is a satire), he shells out the ten grand and has them model one on Lisa. After which things go back to normal... until the two of them find themselves working on a project together, and Kenneth realizes that the attraction is mutual. The only problem is, the Lisa in his apartment seems... a bit jealous over the Lisa in the workplace.

yes, this is absolutely a guy-goes-slowly-crazy story. This isn't a spoiler; the jacket copy and netflix synopsis reveal the most important bits of the above. And make no mistake about it, despite what I said above; this is a grim movie in spots (if you've seen any two random horror movies in your life, you'll know which character in this movie would, in the Star Trek universe, be wearing a red shirt within five minutes of meeting him); eventually, Kenneth finds himself going to extremes to keep his secrets, though there's an ever-shifting cadre of people and an ever-shifting cadre of secrets, which just drives him crazier. And yes, there are a couple of scenes here that get pretty bloody. But compare it to some of the other horror satires out there, only a handful of which I can use that term while keeping a straight face with (<em>Cabin Fever</em>, <em>The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror</em>, and <em>Zombie Honeymoon</em> all come to mind immediately), and <em>Love Object</em> comes up awfully light on the red stuff. I don't consider this a bad thing at all, though Eli Roth fans will be disappointed.

A few critics also commented on the seeming lack of humor. This is also not a bad thing; the best satire is the kind that makes you wonder whether you're supposed to be laughing at it (and if the answer is ""no"", as it is in, for example, <em>Deadgirl</em>, that doesn't make it any less satire), and makes you uncomfortable when you do. To be honest, I'm not sure whether the movie will have that effect on anyone who isn't fascinated by the whole RealDoll phenomenon. I'm also not sure how well the satire is going to work on more well-adjusted individuals; I saw a lot of comments whilst cruising various message boards commenting on how they couldn't believe Kevin was all that maladjusted. (A number of people specifically said they couldn't believe Desmond Harrington, specifically, in the role.) Trust me on this, not that I would ever consider comparing myself to Desmond Harrington in the looks department (or Kenneth Winslow in the exemplary-employee department). Having low, no, or damaged self-esteem does not happen only to those one would suspect. (My god, people, did you never read Lurlene McDaniel?) The more your geek/nerd/dork self-identification, the likelier you are to get this movie, I think.

Given all that, okay, it <em>is</em> a vertical-market little thing, and the fact that it has a 42% professional rating on rotten tomatoes starts looking like a case of little movie succeeding against the odds. And it is a little movie; the reported budget, per IMDB, was a million bucks. Which, again, is something to take into consideration. There's a lot of name talent in this movie, Parigi seems to have done a credible job in his other behind-the-scenes roles in figuring out what to do when one sits in a director's chair (the apartment interiors are just plain claustrophobic), and everything meshes well. It's true--you may not get this movie. But you'll never know unless you give it a shot, and I highly recommend doing so. *** ",1341532800,,4955,4.9770531400966185

This is a great product about love, control, obsession, and the impact that has on a mentally unstable person. It may sound a bit like Lars, but this is more intense, definitely more of a thriller than a softly played quiet kind of film. Desmond Harrington is great in this and the other members of the cast do a fine job as well. I totally recommend this movie.",1309737600,,515,4.375

But this was different than the usual and had a disturbing, psychotic, perverted twist... at the same time you can't take it too seriously, it was somewhat comedic how he behaves and reacts as the movie progresses.  If people rated this poorly they may just not be into movies like this and really shouldn't bother rating...Yes it is a weird movie but its not just ""guy makes doll that looks like girl he likes....guy falls in love with girl....guy freaks out on doll and girl"".  If that's all you see in the movie and you're not into this kind of stuff then don't bother watching or rating.  But again, if you like disturbing, weird, creative stuff, then you may enjoy this (or at least get a laugh from it). I give 5 stars because it was something original and different than I'm used to seeing, and to pick up the 1 star ratings because you just need to take each movie and determine what the audience is, what the director or writter is aiming to do and see if they achieved their goal...its not really about your personal preference for a type of movie. I usually love horror and a little gore.  This did not show a lot of gore and blood, but it did provide a refreshing, disturbing psychological angle that was def different and something you won't forget.

2062736,5,B000255LFC,"A remake or rather a sequel to the theme of American Psycho but with some kind of a twist that makes it funny, funny strange for sure but also funny ah ah. A shy young man who works as a copyrighter and then an editor in a technical publishing house discovers some kind of very special sex doll on the Internet. It really reveals him to himself but also liberates him towards other people, particularly the secretary he is supposed to work with. But the point is that he establishes a fetishistic relation with the doll and the doll becomes jealous, in other words he becomes jealous of himself with the real girl, hence of the real girl who is taking him away from his doll, his real love. In his attempt to liberate himself he destroys, assassinates the doll. But the real girl finds some kind of an advertisement for the sex doll and she reacts very badly. He is fired for sexual harassment and he becomes crazy. So he manages to abduct the girl and brings her to his apartment where he is going to keep her a prisoner and submit her to some heavy treatment that will embalm her and turn her into a doll of sorts. The manager of the apartment complex becomes suspicious. He intrudes and is assassinated for good and cut up into pieces and disposed of in some garbage can. The body is found and that brings the police down to the apartment complex. But the situation has completely been reversed by some mishap and accidents and the girl is the one who is going to get rid of the young pervert. When the police breaks in the visual situation is clear so they shoot the girl dead and the young man is going to be reintegrated in his job and position as the victim of some kind of sadistic woman. That's where it is funny ah ah. Crime pays and the criminal even gets a premium. Kill your girl friends and establish only steady relations with dolls. They may be tyrannical but at least they will neither deceive you nor disappoint you.

This is the comedy and horror elements.  At times, the viewer isn't sure which the movie is intended to be.  Stick with it.  It will all make sense later.

Desmond Harrington does a great job of creating a figure that you want to root for, then feel deathly afraid of.

It (as well as another 'lost treasure' of horror -- MAY) were both overshadowed by the promotional hyperbole of the sub-par CABIN FEVER.  Hopefully, this review will assist in getting this film the status of cult classic it deserves.

The plot breaks down very simply to an introverted guy who falls for his new pretty assistant.  He is so atrophied with shyness that he feebly rejects HER offers of going out.  So what's this poor, misuderstood sap to do . . .?

Empty his bank account to order a life-like sex doll detailed to resemble his assistant, of course!

However, the real fun starts when he finally does begin  to develop a relationship with the young woman . . . And the love doll jealously begins voicing her resentments . . .

2062768,4,B000255LFC,"When I saw a film with the name ""Love Object,"" then learned it was a horror movie involving a mail order doll, I knew I had to pick up a copy. Throw in a cast including Rip Torn and Udo Kier, and you just know this one will be a memorable picture. It is. But the best thing going for ""Love Object"" is Desmond Harrington in the lead role of Kenneth Winslow. Before I get into plot details and some critique related to the picture itself, I'll say why this movie really resonated with me. I know an individual who reminds me of Kenneth Winslow to a T. The guy I know is the most socially awkward person I've ever met in my life, a guy who has a tough time carrying on a normal conversation with anyone. Oftentimes, you'll be talking to him and he'll just turn away and walk off in mid conversation, not because he's intentionally being rude but because he simply doesn't know how to end a conversation. He's the sort of chap you'll wave to in the hallway only to see him look directly at you and keep walking without acknowledging your presence. We used to howl over this unfortunate wretch because of his social ineptness, so when I witnessed some of Winslow's mannerisms I couldn't stop myself from laughing hysterically.

Kenneth Winslow (Harrington) IS a socially inept young man who works for a publisher of technical manuals. His boss Novak (Rip Torn) is a demanding jerk whose insistence on punctuality and thoroughness would rankle a normal person, but Winslow's extremely restricted personality meshes well with such corporate fascism. Kenny is the star of the company, a guy who gets the job done no matter what. When he isn't at work, he moons around his apartment listening to his landlord Radley (Udo Kier) wooing the ladies. Radley thinks Winslow is a bit odd, which he is, but always in a harmless way until two major events fundamentally reshape our main character's life. First, two coworkers introduce Winslow to the wonders of an internet company that makes highly realistic, full sized female dolls for...well, you know. Second, Novak hires a vivacious young lady named Lisa Bellmer (Melissa Sagemiller) to temp around the office. Kenneth ends up buying one of the dolls, figuring that he can pay for it when his promised bonus for a new big project comes through, even as he strikes up the beginnings of a tentative relationship with the slightly dippy but incredibly adorable Lisa. Trouble follows.

Winslow's doll, named Nikki, begins to take over his life in ways he never thought possible. Within days of the doll's arrival, Kenneth seems to hear his new ""girlfriend"" talking to him. She doesn't like his burgeoning relationship with Lisa, for one thing, and every attempt Winslow makes to circumvent his nagging significant other seems to fail. Meanwhile, Kenneth and Lisa achieve wonders with Novak's big project, so much so that Winslow receives a promotion to the much envied position of editor. Lisa stands proudly by his side, as much a part of his success as his own drive and, for that matter, absolutely critical considering how the doll back in the apartment began to exert a serious strain on our boy's mental faculties. Of course Kenneth and Lisa develop a full blown relationship in the midst of all this work, but something odd happens when Winslow begins to change Lisa's appearance in order to make her resemble the doll. Weird stuff. Even weirder is what happens when Ballmer discovers what's going on in the apartment. From this point forward, ""Love Object"" is less about love and more about insanity, violence, and a twist conclusion that definitely turns the tables on Kenneth Winslow.

Director Robert Parigi's film is a pitch-dark effort, a horror movie with more psychological shocks than bloodshed. The red stuff does flow, eventually, but ""Love Object"" does far more with claustrophobic atmosphere and seedy sets than it accomplishes with garish arterial splashing. Kenneth's workplace and living quarters exude a dinginess that mirrors well his own repressed personality, and it's only when he meets Lisa that the movie occasionally lightens up in both surroundings and tone. Winslow is too far gone mentally, however, and the movie soon zooms back into darkness. I think Desmond Harrington ought to win some sort of award for his portrayal of such a dismal human being. He's never less than totally convincing playing such an offbeat character, and he's definitely put to the test as an actor when the script calls for him to interact with the doll (!). Rip Torn and Udo Kier provide a bit of comic relief in spots, and both men help the film zip along whenever they appear by providing excellent support to the primary actors. Lisa Sagemiller is certainly a find, playing an excellent second fiddle to Harrington's grim persona. Good acting, great atmosphere, and a slow yet effective pace make ""Love Object"" a fun film to watch. I'd like to say this is the feel good hit of 2003, but of course I'd be lying. It's more like the ""feel like taking a shower afterwards"" movie of 2003.

As for extras on the Lion's Gate DVD release, we get a commentary track, poster stills, an interview with Udo Kier, behind the scenes stuff, a photo gallery, and trailers for ""Ju-On,"" ""Godsend,"" ""Open Water,"" and ""Monster Man."" I recommend ""Love Object"" for all of my fellow horror fans, especially for the ones who are sick enough in the head to find some humor in the idea of a love doll taking over a person's personality. Lion's Gate has been releasing a lot of cheap clunkers to DVD recently--fortunately, this film isn't one of them. Definitely give this one a go.",1120867200,,5604,4.7921406411582215

Not because I'm into sex dolls (I'm not),
but because it is an excellent opportunity
to safely view the mind of a disturbed,
sex offender, or anybody who is emotionally/socially

of madness right up to the first incidence of violence
and the immediate aftermath (quite shocking). It
makes you wish you could find people dealing
with these issues and help them before it's too late.

I won't dive into retelling the plot too much, but
I will say that this movie is extremely well written.
The ending is neo-classic, and the plot twists are
addictive. The action slowly rises to the climax
and you find yourself being drawn in deeper and deeper.
Never in a million years would I have expected the

""Love Object"" draws its inspiration from two well-known sources, one a literary classic, the other a classic of twentieth century pop culture: first, the Greek myth ""Pygmalion,"" in which a sculptor carves ""the perfect woman"" out of stone only to discover that it isn`t all that easy to love an inanimate object that can`t love you back; and, second, the ""Twilight Zone"" episode entitled ""Living Doll,"" with Telly Savalas as an abusive stepfather who is haunted and eventually done in by a little girl's Talky Tina doll, whose anthropomorphic capabilities go far beyond mere conversation.

In ""Love Object,"" Kenneth is a psychopathic loner who orders a customized, anatomically correct companion named Nikki off the internet.  When the shy, introverted young man falls for Lisa, a pretty blond co-worker, he begins to project all of the unsuspecting girl's qualities and traits onto the doll, treating Nikki as if she were Lisa and Lisa as if she were Nikki.  Eventually he gets the two so completely mixed up in his head that it seems as if the mannequin herself, driven by paranoia and jealousy, is beginning to act out her anger in fits of potentially homicidal rage.

As twisted low budget horror films go, ""Love Object"" works fairly well for the first hour or so, even though it feels as if we have seen this basic storyline a few too many times before (often with a ventriloquist's dummy as the nemesis).  In addition to the creepy atmosphere, writer/director Robert Parigi provides a few highly effective moments of dark humor to keep us unnerved and off balance.  Unfortunately - as is the won't of so many horror movies these days - the film's tone turns so ugly and sadistic in the final half hour that the movie loses us completely and we find ourselves simply wishing that the whole bloody ordeal would get over as quickly as possible.  More's the pity, since  Desmond Harrington delivers an effectively understated account of a man teetering on the brink of insanity, while Melissa Sagemiller is warm and winning as the flesh-and-blood dream girl who becomes, first, his love interest and, later, his victim.  Rip Torn provides some subtle humor as the boss more concerned with workplace propriety and avoiding sexual harassment lawsuits than with cultivating a case of young love blossoming in his very own office.

The movie also does an effective job making the case that the modern corporate world sees its workers more as dispensable automatons and robots - or dolls, if you prefer - than valued human beings.  What a shame that the movie undercuts all its various virtues in the end by going whole hog over-the-top.  Where's Rod Serling when we need him?",1113004800,2,2679,4.900442477876106
2062773,3,B000255LFC,"I add my voice to the others that ranked this film as unique but odd. It's a story about love -- very stilted love -- that turns into a horror film and ends in a twist of irony. I think the producer and director had very clever ideas when they created this movie, which is low budget and has no stars.

If you like unusual fare or horror, there's probably something in this movie for you. If you like mainstream Hollywood movies or disdain blood and guts, you probably won't find much humor or irony in this movie.

So, got for it adventurers and enjoy a one of a kind entertainment.",1108598400,2,583,4.243243243243243

2062775,4,B000255LFC,"This movie goes into a little visited horror neighborhood: the realm of the creepy living mannequin. Up to this point, the best examples of this type of thriller would be Woody from ""Fear"" and ""Pin"" but Robert Parigi manages to deliver a more complex story than either of those films.

This creepy flick has a wonderfully depraved sensibility and seems to be marching to the tune of Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"". Acting is solid throughout, and even Rip Torn seems restrained from his normal cartoonish antics. Rather than going for jump scares, this movie goes for a slow build of dread and suspense. There are a couple of good cringes in the movie, and it's definitely worth a watch.",1106265600,,685,4.805084745762712
2062776,4,B000255LFC,"""Love Object"" is an intense film to say the least, but as with so many horror films about mannequins/dummies, we don't find out it until actually we rent it or buy it whether the dummy in question (in this case a sex doll) is actually alive, or a product of the protagonist's deranged imagination.  Nikki, the sex doll, is NOT alive.  Kenneth is a repressed, neurotic pervert hellbent on obtaining some kind of affection from the

female sex, and as we find out later in the film, at any cost.

If nothing else, the mood of this film is so unrelentingly weird that we cannot not help but appreciate being given a glimpse into the life of an empty shell of a human being--a neat trick for any filmmaker to pull off.  It deserves four stars just for the moody ambiance it creates.  The presence of Udo Kier as the loopy, nosy neighbor adds to it.

Kenneth goes from being a quiet loser who works diligently at his office job during the day to a fetishist within a very short time.  Paying 10,000 or so dollars for ""Nikki"", a creepy looking S&M doll, there is an uneven kilter to the film: at times it is simply laughable to watch this guy, with the personality of a rock, try to relate to a not even remotely looking human dummy, and other times really sick and scary.  This is what throws the movie off.

It really takes off when he meets his new temporary assistant, Lisa *Bellmer*.  Here the director pays homage to Hans Bellmer, the dark surrealist artist who was obsessed with female mannequins and dolls of all kinds.  Perhaps the relationship between Lisa and Ken is a kind of take off on the relationship between Unica Zurn and Hans Bellmer--one driving the other mad with fetishistic idealization and the other suffering as a result.

The ending is a little unbelievable but somehow fits with the skewed dream logic of the entire movie.  You have to see this to really experience it, if you want to.  A great mood piece, sort of Lynchian.",1105574400,,1945,4.485795454545454
2062777,4,B000255LFC,"I found the concept behind this film fascinating.  I'd read about life-like sex dolls, like the one portrayed in ""Love Object,"" and wondered why someone would want one.  It's easy to understand why a man would want a doll that looks and feels like a real woman, and the people who make these dolls are genuinely talented.  But why would they be willing to pay so much money ($10,000 in this film) for what is esentially a masturbation aid?  Truly, some men have no imagination.  But when ""Love Object"" examines the relationship between Kenneth and ""Nikki,"" it shows that for some people, the doll may be a substitute for human companionship.

Kenneth orders a realistic sex doll named Nikki over the internet, and selects preferences that allow him to model Nikki after his attractive new coworker, Lisa.  Kenneth talks to Nikki, and acts as if she is also speaking to him.  He even serves her dinner and watches films with her that he thinks she might enjoy.  He observes Lisa, her makeup and clothing choices, and even the music she listens to, and imposes them all onto Nikki.  Lisa is a temp, and wears a lot of clothing from thrift stores.  She mentions to Kenneth that she when she gets a real job she wants some new clothes.  Kenneth responds by buying clothes for Nikki that he thinks Lisa would want if she could afford them.  After a while, Lisa and Kenneth become close, but Kenneth has become so accustomed to Nikki that he can't imagine her letting him go.  The conversations he imagines between them become jealous fighting.

After Lisa and Kenneth are an ""item,"" he takes her out shopping for new clothes.  He mentions his ""ex,"" Nikki.  Lisa learns the truth about Nikki when she finds a postcard advertisement for the sex doll.  The doll has been modeled after Lisa from the beginning, but since she has just bought the new, expensive clothing, she sees it backward, and thinks he has modeled her after the doll.  This is one scene in an otherwise successfully rendered film that doesn't quite work.  Lisa thinks, at first, that Kenneth has chosen clothes for her so that she will look like his ""ex,"" until she turns the card over to see that Nikki is a doll.  I expected her to feel really dumb and apologize, because that's what I'd do.  The only reason she thinks this is a picture of his ex is because it has the same name.  I don't think that her first assumption would be that this sex doll had to be the ""ex,"" just because they were both named Nikki.  Of course, in Kenneth's mind, this IS a picture of his ""ex.""  I think Lisa should have learned the truth about Kenneth by Kenneth's REACTION to her finding the card, instead of her figuring everything out just by finding it.

From a feminist perspective, the film is interesting because Nikki represents what some men want women to be.  Nikki is attractive, allows her partner to have sex with her any way he chooses, and only tells him what he wants to hear.  When Kenneth begins to interact in a sexual way with a real live woman, he learns that in a real relationship, there will be conflict.  When a woman has her own personality, you can't control what she'll say or do.  His relationship with the doll represents his desire to control every aspect of a woman for his own pleasure.

I thought the lead actor was brilliant in the role, but he was a little too good looking to be believable as being this socially inept.  It was obvious he was too shy to approach women.  That much was certainly established.  But I found it hard to believe that a guy this cute had never had a woman interested in him before.  A theme explored in the film ""May,"" was that the female lead was actually quite pretty, and had no problem getting a few people to talk to her.  The problem was that she was such a weirdo that once they got to know her, they were no longer interested.  In ""Love Objects,"" it's never really clear what was so weird about Kenneth to begin with.  Before the doll, he seemed a bit shy, but shy enough to repulse all women in spite of his good looks.

Others have said that the ending, as well as the overall tone of the film, might not appeal to women, but as a feminist, I found it very appropriate.  A woman being victimized will often respond in anger, and a woman's anger, even when justified, is often interpreted by society as irrationality and hysteria.  If you take your girlfriend to a restaurant and flirt with the waitress, and your girlfriend (or the waitress, for that matter) gets mad, do you really think it's because she's having her period?  (hint: if you answered ""yes,"" you are incorrect.)  This film examines a male's instinct to assert dominance and control over a female, as well as society's temptation to blame the victim in such a case.",1100908800,2,4746,4.508196721311475
2062778,5,B000255LFC,"This is my KIND of film.

It had all the right elements: psychological thriller, male eroticism, unique plot, and great acting. Parigi did a fantastic job at getting to the ""core"" of the male animal and the human need for companionship. I laughed at all of the darkly funny characters (e.g. the landlord and the police officer).

It was easy for the viewer to FEEL FOR the protagonist because of his well-developed characterization of a lonely and simple man who seeks female companionship. Plus, he was also very handsome!

Great film overall. One of my favorites...

2062779,4,B000255LFC,"Love Object is an intense, slick low budget thriller that looks and feels like a much bigger film than it is.

Given an astonishing performance by Desmond Harrington, the protagonist, Kenneth is a disturbing, likeable fellow who reminds us of someone each of us probably knows - as well as a little bit of ourselves. Harrington's presents us with the too-identifiable factor that success and professional achievement do not equate with personal satisfaction or happiness.  Life can be cold and lonely.

When Ken orders $10,000 doll Nikki and begins a relationship with her, things are only bound to get messy.  Really messy.  The already blurred lines between reality and fantasy have only one way to go here - and it isn't up.

Watching Kenneth completely unhinge over the course of 90 minutes is a treat, albeit a delightfully, dark and disturbing one.  Ever bouncing between his fictional reality and the real world, Kenneth finds himself ever closer to a precipice which, having once jumped, there is no turning back.

With dark comedic writing, atmospheric lighting, music and sound effects Love Object visually and aurally point up classic horror films with a particularly eerie and beautiful Frankenstein feel in the film's penultimate moments make this a winner.

It could have been better ... there could have been more twists or a more original plot.

In this movie the main character obviously has an obsession with sex, but feels ashamed about it so when he buys a sex doll online ... he make-believes the doll, ""Nikki"" is punishing him because he's been a ""bad boy"".  But alas, it is all in his head.  The ending of the film was a bit twisted (I don't want to give it all away ... you'll have to form your own opinion) but it was also a teensy bit predictable.  I didn't feel enough for either of the main characters ... the audience is just kind of forced to feel bad for them.

It is the most extreme for of obsession a man can have for a woman. It gets to the point where he actually has conversations with the doll and thinks the doll is doing things (similar to psycho's concept of Normans mom).

2062784,2,B000255LFC,"This is an odd film.

Kenneth, a socially inept technical writer (although he's really too handsome for his ineptness to be convincing) orders a sex doll that would make anyone who's into that sort of thing drool. It's not your everyday run-of-the-mill plastic blow-up doll! On the firm's website that manufactures the dolls, you choose the eyes, the hair, the lips, the breasts - everything. And Kenneth chooses to model the doll after a co-worker, Lisa.

There are comedic moments in this film, such as when the doll arrives. It comes in an enormous crate - too small for a refrigerator, but large enough to make getting it through his apartment door problematic. A tiny moment of tension erupts when his next door neighbor, who not surprisingly is the building manager, offers to help Kenneth open the crate. Luckily, Kenneth gets it through the door in time.

There are also uncomfortable moments, particularly when Kenneth first makes out with the doll, and then has sex with it. You can't help but groan a bit during that. Thus begins the relationship between Kenneth and Nikki. (Good comedy during some of their ""romantic"" scenes"".)

However, this is carefully juxtaposed with his growing interest in and closeness to the real thing - Lisa. And, of course, Nikki is jealous, and does some nasty things - oh, the doll comes to life, although not a la Chucky - and gets into Kenneth's head so purely that when Lisa invites him in and they get to business, Kenneth can't keep up with his end of the bargain.

There are some unexplained oddities. The perverts in the film are all identified by purplish-red markings on their necks or faces (even the person who delivered the doll had a purple mark) and by the end of the movie, Kenneth has one as well. It seems that the more perverse you are, the more distorted you are by these markings. The face of the owner of a sex shop, for example, is not only covered in markings, it's also rather grotesquely deformed

Lots of things happen (which I can't say, or I'd be giving things away) and then Kenneth and Lisa are enjoying promotions and camaraderie at work. Lisa comes to realize that a doll was modeled after her (although her logic on discovering it was backwards, and explaining away the card she found would have been a lie easy enough for a kindergartner to pull off) and she's not pleased with Kenneth's perfidy. She files a complaint with the company, yada yada yada, and Kenneth is fired.

His job, we know, and the obsession he had for Nikki/Lisa, was all he had. This put him over the edge, and just in case we can't tell, the director lets us know by mussing up his hair a bit. Then the film meanders into a rather bizarre Texas Chainsaw Massacre theme and ends in a fashion that is both surprising and unbelievable. It might have been a little more believable if not for the horrendous acting of the detective (or perhaps it was the lines he was given; it's hard to tell). The kangaroo in Kangaroo Jack seemed more fit to be a detective than this loon. It really wasn't necessary for him to be an idiot, so I don't know why he was.

Like I said, an odd film, with odd elements. And they kind of fit, although not always comfortably so.

I'd like to see Desmond Harrington, who was in another horror film with Texas Chainsaw Massacre overtures, Wrong Turn, break out of horror films. He seems to possess some talent, and right now it's being squandered.",1090800000,8,3418,4.590163934426229

2062786,4,B000255LFC,"Ah, the perils of office romance. Here we have Kenneth (Desmond Harrington) a man who works at a tech firm. He can't get a date because he's shy. So he spends his nights nursing a closet porn habit and goes to weird S&M shops.
We also have Lisa (Melissa Sagemiller, who looks quite good in a teddy) a newcomer who is having trouble fitting in around the office. See, she's a temp. She's also pretty, blond, and thin so naturally, everybody hates her. Even Kenneth shuns her at first when they are assigned to the same project together. However, Kenneth still takes note of her looks.
One night Ken decides to order a sex doll off of a website. For $10,000 you can have ""Nikki"" custom made to your specifications. Everything from eyes, nose, hair color, body shape, etc. Almost as an afterthought, he uses Lisa's appearance as the mold. Soon, ""Nikki"" arrives and Ken starts having fun. However, at the same time he also developes a closeness with Lisa. And perhaps subconsciencely influenced by Nikki's resemblence to her, Ken strikes up a romantic relationship with Lisa. Soon, all is bliss. Kenneth & Lisa are not only working like a well oiled machine on their assignment together, but they are pretty hot n' heavy too.
However, there's trouble afoot. Turns out ""Nikki"" is the jealous type...
I'm going to leave it right there. This movie is too much fun to give away the ending. It's made in the same spirit as ""May"" and ""Ginger Snaps.""
