This provides valuable video of the streets, pace, and attitudes of NYC and its locals. The history behind NYC is an excellent way to realize the capacity, excitement, and potential that NYC provides new visitors. What is awestruck is that Manhattan has so much to see, its physically impossible to see and do it all in a short time. If you do, you'll miss something worthwhile.

I purchased this dvd along with Globe Trecker, NYC, and both were very helpful. The coolest part of it was seeing buildings, steets, and people before arriving for my trip on July 23-27.

The result was I was not as overwhelmed with it all when I arrived.

NYC.......ahhh.........the adrenaline continually is pumped

After watching the DVD, you gain a good understanding of the influence of immigrants to New York City, and how their contributions collectively built the city to the great metropolis that it is today.",1054512000,8,321,4.631578947368421
8294916,5,B00005V1XF,"Although obviously made before September 11th, this history of New York is fantastic.  It moves like a rocket and James Woods is great as the narrator. It's really great when dealing with little-known parts of New York's history -- like how Central Park got started and the origins of Wall Street.
If you have any interest at all in New York, you should see this!",1010966400,8,363,4.584615384615384
