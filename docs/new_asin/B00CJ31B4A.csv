He's the psycho/sociopath that his mother and her cohorts have to cover up for. As much as Nina Foch is featured as the star,if it wasn't for Macready's outstanding performance,I would never have watched this. Foch said yers later she found it hysterically funny Dame May Whitty having Macready for her son here,but no one else could've been as menacing or held my attention.",1492646400,,523,4.954545454545454

She is imprisoned by psychopaths with mysterious intentions. How can she possibly escape is the focus of the film. This is a standard thriller with everything about the film being simply average. Its entertaining enough for a view, but nothing exceptional.",1488672000,,429,4.890410958904109
