3673710,5,B001KW90P8,I love this DVD set!  The DVD's are both challenging and fun.  I love the scenery too.  I am a runner but new to the yoga scene.  Even though I am new I did not feel intimidated by the workout.  These DVD's are great whether you are experienced or just starting out.  The set comes with nutrition guidelines and some recipes as well.  Highly recommended!,1266710400,2,354,4.3538461538461535
3673711,5,B001KW90P8,I was truly impressed with Anastasia's DVDs which have easy yoga exercises suitable for anyone. They did help me improve my flexibility and body strength. Highly recommended.,1262131200,3,174,5.481481481481482
3673712,5,B001KW90P8,Took a chance on this set...find myself going back to it often.  Real pleasant and a lot of value too.  Worth it.,1231372800,2,113,4.090909090909091
8316320,5,B001KW90P8,"When I was younger I lifted weight and when I say people doing yoga I laughed at it and called a lazy work out. Granted it has been about 20 years, I have to say YOGA IS AN ass KICKING  OF A LIFE TIME. I was sweating, my arms were trembling  and what made it  all the harder was I have no sense of balance.
with practice I and everyone who is new to yoga just stick  with  it  and do it everyday. After 5 days  I am getting stronger and balance is getting much improved. JUST REMEMBER YOGA IS A LIFESTYLE. TO ALL THEORY NEW YOGIES  GOODS PLACE TO START.

8316322,5,B001KW90P8,"Anastasia has a way of describing how to position your body as you hold the poses that revolutionized the way I do yoga. After working on Yoga Pulse, I went to an in-person yoga class and the instructor commented that it looked like I'd been doing yoga for a long time! Poses are strength-building and leave you feeling like you had a great workout. Great for beginners.",1419465600,,370,4.537313432835821
8316323,5,B001KW90P8,Very well done.  Easy to follow.  I like them very much.  Hard to beat the price too. Definitely would recommend.,1412467200,,113,4.55
8316324,1,B001KW90P8,"Yoga Pulse, not to be confused with Pulse Yoga, which is great.  Ugh..I really wanted to like this set, but I couldn't get through the first disc.  First the voiceover..I usually love voiceover yoga dvd's.  However, this one sounded more like the instructor was announcing at a sporting event.  It had that echo due to the recording.  That alone would have been a deal breaker for me, but there's more.  This set would be probably ok for anyone who doesn't mind the audio issue and can stand affirmation(I already like myself plenty, thanks) type instruction and is okay with a highly spiritual yoga practice.  By highly spiritual, I mean that unless you consider yourself a deity, you will not like this at all.  If you are looking for a true hatha only workout, sorry, this is not it.",1375315200,3,786,4.644927536231884
8316325,5,B001KW90P8,This is the best yoga DVD set that I have ever tried!  It can be easy or advanced.  I like it so much that I purchased another set for my Florida home.  I don't want to be without it.  Anastasia  inspiring voice is key to the routines.,1359331200,,235,3.9148936170212765
8316326,5,B001KW90P8,"I'm absolutely in love with Yoga Pulse! It has 6 different DVDs, so you are able to choose which particular workout is better for your current mood, activity level and time frame. Great for a Begginer or for an Advanced yogi. Challenging and at the same time very relaxing postures, perfect sequencing, beautiful ocean scenery, and  instructor's calm voice make you feel very good, connected with your body, open and grounded. Highly reccomended!",1328572800,,446,5.109589041095891
8316327,5,B001KW90P8,"This collection of yoga videos was amazing. I am new the yoga scene, and these six DVDs really helped me learn a lot!  The instructor, Anastasia, will guide you through everything you need to know, plus there is a chart depicting all the positions.  Doing these exercises was a great work out, and very relaxing as well.  Also there is a nutrition guideline and recipes, which I really enjoyed using.  With six DVDs at $40 dollars which provide a wonderful, relaxing (but effective) workout I'd say it was well worth the investment.  Needless to say my experience working out following theses DVDs was amazing and I would recommend it to anyone male of female!",1325980800,,660,4.754385964912281
8316328,2,B001KW90P8,"I've purchased/used several yoga dvds and this is by far the worst. I would describe it as ""pre-beginner."" It's very slow-moving, with a lot of religious overtones. If you're a Christian, I suggest you pass on this. It's also over-priced.",1316995200,4,238,4.975
8316329,5,B001KW90P8,"We have found these DVDs enjoyable, easy to follow and beautiful to watch. Anastasia's descriptions of the poses help you adjust to make sure you're doing them just right. Great to do on your own time, or start a few minutes, pause if you get interrupted, and then continue. There's no excuse not to do them, right in the comfort of your home. This collection is not female-only by any means! My husband (a football guy, not a yoga guy!) even does them with me!",1281657600,4,461,4.435294117647059
