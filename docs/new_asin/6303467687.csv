7848055,5,6303467687,"--Two Carmen Sandiego videos are being released in November 2001. I hope this means that the producers are responding to the thousands of fans who protested when the five-time Emmy nominated and one-time winner ""Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?"" disappeared from TV listings everywhere. For years they kept us loyal fans in suspense - wondering what was going on, exactly where on earth WAS Carmen, and wondering if the four old videos - rapidly disappearing from both video stores and Web shopping sites - were going to disappear for good. Well, that doesn't look like that's going to happen. --""A Date With Carmen"" is a two-epsiode show which is fascinating. Carmen has discovered a way to time travel - she's going back in time to such U.S. history events as the Boston Tea Party - and changing the present U.S. to a British-owned country! This is quite exciting and shows us quite a bit about the mysteries of time-travel. --Marisa",1002240000,3,937,4.826086956521739
7848056,5,6303467687,"I remember when I got so angry when they took this show off the air. I was about 13 at the time( I,m 19 now). This is still one of my all-time favorite cartoons. Everything about it was great. Well made charachters, great plot, funny humor and the fact that you learn about history in this show makes this show a standout. If you can find this video as well as any of the other videos. Carmen Sandiego is one of the most unique charachters ever created. They either need to put this show back on the ari or put all the episodes on video and DVD.",1001808000,,545,4.102803738317757
7848057,5,6303467687,"When I was seven years old, this television show was on once a week. It was the only show I cared about. I never watched anything else. When they took it off the air, I was so angry. I cried. I wrote and almost mailed letters to them. I rented the four available videos with only eight episodes thousands of times and still am. I hope that the station decides to put out more videos or put the television show back on, for this is the one show I really miss.",978393600,,458,4.043956043956044
7848058,4,6303467687,"By combining fun plants and globe-trotting, likeable characters they have created a fun way to learn geography and history and world culture without realizing that you are learning...<p>I have enjoyed watching (and even re-watching) this video - not surprisingly my son enjoyed it even more.  The three videos I own in the series were educational (without being pedantic) and fast paced.  Highly recommended for children ages 5 through 12.<p>There is a bit of fighting (fortunately no killing and no blood) which may make it inappropriate for very young children.<p>Please find out when the series will be re-released.  They were great.",973296000,,636,5.34
7848059,5,6303467687,"I couldn't get this on home video, but I went to Hollywood Video rental store, rented all four of the volumes, and copied all of them tape-to-tape  one by one.  There was a bit of static and mess-ups on my homemade copy of  the tape.  Please find out if this is coming out again on video or DVD, or  find a rental store that still has these tapes.  If they release these  out-of-print videos for the first time on DVD (at least I hope they  do/will), the picture and sound will be DVD quality with no static or  mess-ups.  You go Carmen!",967420800,,537,4.176470588235294
