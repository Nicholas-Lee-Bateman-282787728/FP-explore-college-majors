4255679,5,B0043GAZZM,"Rafael Nadal Fans will love this.

I am Rafael Nadal's biggest fan & this DVD has been played a million times, I love it! Rafa got the career Grand Slam with this win as well as his 1st US Open title so it's a piece of history.

I was as exhausted as the players must have been when it finished because when you're watching as a fan and you really, really want your man to win, you go through all the highs and lows with them and feel worn out by the end (but very very happy!)

Sorry for Djokovik fans, you won't enjoy it as much as I did because he lost but you'll still find it an entertaining match!

Other Rafa fans will love this book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poetry-of-Passion-for-People-with-a-Pulse/dp/0956526608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)</a>&nbsp;it's got 80 poems in about how us fans feel about him, the highs the lows and his lovely humble personality and his sexy looks, and the other poems about love are good too.",1298419200,,1032,4.982558139534884
4255680,5,B0043GAZZM,"Being a huge fan of Rafa's I had to buy this (in fact I buy almost everything he's in!) as it was a match that made history as his win here gave him the ""Career Grand Slam"" & it was his 1st US Open win.

I recorded it at the time but also wanted this as a souvenir & backup in case I wear out my recording!

Watching Rafa & Djokovic is always exciting, obviously Rafa's fans will enjoy this more as he won!

Rafa fans will also love the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poetry-of-Passion-for-People-with-a-Pulse/dp/0956526608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)</a>&nbsp;as it has a long chapter called ""A Fan's Feelings"" of 80 poems about Rafa, his career, his personality & his good looks (& the rest of the book is brilliant too) No Rafa fan should be without it!",1298332800,,856,5.1
4255681,5,B0043GAZZM,I like the product very much. They deliveried item faster than my expecation. I got it before Christmas time. I have a very good time this year because I can enjoy watching this DVD with my boyfriend.

4255682,4,B0043GAZZM,"Rafael Nadal accomplished two amazing feats in 2010; winning three Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces, and becoming a member of a select group of players who have a career Grand Slam (winning at least one of each of the four tournaments).  When you look at the list, it's interesting to see who isn't part of that ""club"" (Borg, Connors, and match commentator John McEnroe, among others).  This DVD shows not only the historic occasion, but Rafa at his best against a valiant effort by Djokovic, who's game was definitely helped by the 1 day rain delay following his 5-set semi-final win over Roger Federer.  This DVD brings you the coverage from CBS, which switched over to ESPN following the rain delay, with Dick Enberg, Mary Carillo (on the CBS portion) and John McEnroe at the mikes.  The commercials, music, and extra chatter around the rain delay have been removed, but all of the match is here.  Even a few extra seconds following the trophy presentation after ESPN went to football.  Bravo Rafa!",1289865600,5,1014,4.7988505747126435
4255683,2,B0043GAZZM,"While I'm happy to have the match on DVD, this is a poorly produced DVD. They cut off the video/sound (mid player step/mid announcer sentence) at the end of games to jump forward to the start of the next. There's no rhythm, flow or transitions. Why  not let us see the players returning to their seats and/or thinking through their issues on the change-overs? The whole match feels compressed and choppy, which is a shame. The tennis being played is wonderful and the result adds a big chapter to the tennis history books - it deserves a much better DVD than this.",1289606400,5,564,4.529411764705882

8414883,5,B0043GAZZM,"NOBODY ANALYZES  TENNIS BETTTET THAN JOHNNY MAC, ALWAYS FROM THE PLAYER'S POINT OF VIEW, TELLING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, OR NOT DONE.
\YOU COULD ClLOSE YOUR EYES AND PRETEND THIS IS RADION, AND MC ENROE WILL MAKE THE  MATCHL AS REAL AND EXCITING AS IF SEEN  ON TV  (OR DVD) .
 ALONG WITH  VIN SCULLY,  JOHNNY MAC  IS THE  BEST.

8414884,5,B0043GAZZM,The 2-DVD set was excellent quality.  I'm glad that I have my own personal copy of such an historic event and terrific tennis match.,1420070400,,132,4.5

8414889,5,B0043GAZZM,When I buy a dvd I want it to be from the American  point of view and mainly with John McEnroe. Please don't leave out half of the ending ceremonies. I do like it that you can stop and start the dvd at different sets.,1352678400,,217,3.8222222222222224
8414890,4,B0043GAZZM,"It's edited a bit poorly. There are times when it quickly fades to black when you'd like to have seen a little bit more of the reaction or heard more of the commentary between games. But the match itself is great to watch, and the quality is relatively good.",1349740800,,258,4.285714285714286
