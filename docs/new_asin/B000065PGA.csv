7961185,3,B000065PGA,"The first installment of Lexx was silly but had its entertaining moments. This one does too but the silliness factor has increased dramatically. Often, it is more of a comedy than an action or science fiction show, even with some creditable visual effects to watch. Eva Habermann is, of course, the most stunning visual effect.

In this episode, the Crew of the Lexx has managed to flee into the shadow zone but they are not sure where to go. Kai has only enough proto blood to last a little while longer. Zev decides to try and find Kai's home planet in the hope that something there will help. They do find the planet but it is deserted. It had been abandoned millennia ago because the sun was unstable. Some things are still working, however. There is a great library, the machines which keep the sun from exploding are buzzing along nicely and some electronic ""ghosts"" are available to guide them through the library. The problem is, the ghost has its own agenda and that seems to include dismembering some of the crew and appropriating the body of another. They have a few allies, though. These include the sun, a cannibal woman and the brains of a bunch of former Shadows. It is silliness run amuck but Habermann is still terribly cute.",1138147200,,1242,4.619909502262443
7961186,4,B000065PGA,"I am a huge fan of Lexx. I really think it is one of the best shows I've ever seen on TV. I got into it around the middle of the second season & became an addict after that. I have all of the DVD's & have seen every episode (even the movies) multiple times. I plan to review each DVD, each episode, one by one. So here's my review for Series 1, Volume 2

Episode 1.2: Super Nova  - The second mini-movie out of 4.  In this episode we get to know more about Giggerota, a woman cannibal that stows away with the Lexx when they escape from the Cluster in the first mini-movie.  All she basically wants to do is eat & try to force Stan to find some planet she can eat all she wants.  Luckily Xev keeps her in check sort of.  Xev really likes Kai, but Kai is dead so he can fulfill her wishes.  Xev wants desperately to bring back Kai to life.  She thinks if they go visit the planet of Kai's ancestors they might be able to find something to help him.  They head off to that planet & when they get there they notice this sun that looks like it could explode & these machines are keeping it from doing that (this comes in later).  An episode ensues that you learn a little more about Kai & his race the Brunnen-G.  Xev does not find a way to bring back Kai to live but the crew does find trouble, each in their own way.  Basically Giggerota sabotages the machines that keep the Sun safe & tries to leave with the Lexx.  I won't spoil how but the crew manages to get out of the situation.  Tim Curry plays a cool character called ""Poet"" & he does a great job with it.  Overall a very good episode that has both funny & serious moments. (Episode Rating: 4 out of 5)",1109548800,9,1658,4.012195121951219
