On the other hand, this Opera is not as good as Puccini's masterpieces, nevertheless, I wanted to get familiar with it.  All the singers are good and the ballet dancing is a welcome addition though possibly a bit too distracting (a bit too sensual) from the opera.  I would buy the opera if it had subtitles in italian so I could follow along.  I don't think Amazon is set up to give us the choice of multiple languages for the subtitles but maybe they will soon.",1392854400,,594,4.221238938053097
8342583,1,B001U1L9NK,"One of the problems with having a festival dedicated primarily to the works of one composer is that you have to keep mounting new productions offering new views of familiar works.  This production certainly went too far.  La Rondine is a charming, though not profound, work.  This production misses all the charm and goes for the ghastly.  The costumes and settings are a poor man's version of the Capitol in Hunger Games, and it is just as bleak.  The singing is not bad, but you are constantly distracted by the dancing r-rated commentary and the hideous production and you can't enjoy it.  This convoluted version has Magda being dumped by Ruggero because he is betrayed--not altogether convincing.  Go for the charming Metropolitan Opera Live in HD version of this opera instead of this downer.",1350172800,8,798,4.91044776119403
8342584,3,B001U1L9NK,"As others have mentioned, Puccini was dissatisfied with the plot of ""La Rondine"", and revised it several times. Here we have the third version of 1921, which includes at least 30 minutes of different or heavily re-arranged music.  There is, for instance, an entirely new scene with three clothing sellers, and the character Rambaldo reappears briefly in the third act.  However, musically, I don't feel that the result holds together any better than the third act of the original version, and the plot is certainly no more convincing, and seems even a bit more contrived (if this is possible!).

I am glad that this performance was recorded, since I have long wondered what the 1921 version might sound like, but I'd just assume listen to the soundtrack without watching the video, since I found the frequent dancing a distraction, often inappropriate, and occasionally embarrassing.  The scene of the third act includes a picture of a human corpse (the fallen swallow, I guess), and a large birdcage into which our dear Magda must eventually retreat.  I think this speaks for itself in terms of production values.

For the most part, the musicians do a good job; just turn off the picture and listen!",1282521600,3,1201,4.920792079207921
8342585,5,B001U1L9NK,"I am always happy about reviewers using the expression euro trash. not sure what exactly it means, but it usually indicates that it is an entertaining and clever production. and so is this one. the previous reviewer points out that the lead tenor looks like a whale and that there are ballet dancers on stage most of the time, which he thinks are just distracting. I couldn't agree more and I think it was very clever from the director to have the dancers to distract from the singers visually, as you wouldnt believe them for a second that they are madly in love. also the ""number"" of two guys is just two guys dancing with each other. that should be perfectly acceptable in the 21st century. overall I think it is a very entertaining production and what I really liked about the dvd production is that they used overlays of different scenes (eg singers and dancers or close up and wide angle) so that you don't miss anything thats going on stage.
I have to agree that the singers are only adequate, but if you are looking for a timely, entertaining and clever production, go for it. People who don't like euro trash should rather stick to their stone age material.",1242777600,14,1166,4.530805687203792
8342586,1,B001U1L9NK,"""Rondine"" is a lovely work,apart from the old Carteri DVD it has fared badly so far.
This latest version from Torre del Lago is truly abysmal. Another Euro trash production. A pair of dancers are almost always onstage,even during the singers' biggest moments. They add nothing and are a distraction. It gets worse in the second act where the waiters are dressed in jockey shorts,and two of them perform a ""number"".
The singers are no more than adequate. The Ruggero looks like a beached whale,very ugly. Looking like this I expected an excellent voice,but he very ordinary. Hard to know why he was cast.
The City Opera telecast their production years ago,and it was very faithful to the opera,with a cast of young,attractive,talented singers. Wish they would issue it.
""Rondine"" in the past few years has come into it's own in the theater,but on DVD it is suffering the same fate it had before the recent rediscovery.
I'm not crazy about the Met's 20's production,but given the competition it would be a welcome issue.",1242432000,17,1018,4.85632183908046
