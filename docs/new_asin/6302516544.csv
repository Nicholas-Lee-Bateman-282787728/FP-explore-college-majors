475430,5,6302516544,"This is a overall very-fine TV movie, putting a different slant on the story of Anne Frank and her family.  Mary Steenburgen plays heroic Miep Gies, the young woman who helped the Franks' and the others in ATTIC: THE HIDING OF ANNE FRANK.  This movie attempts to tell the story of `The Diary of Anne Frank' from a different perspective, that of Miep.  Naturally we get to see a lot more of Miep (and Anne is very much a supporting character here), nevertheless the premise works well and Steenburgen offers a touching performance.  The film is based on the real-life Miep Gies' book, co-authored with Alison Leslie Gold, ""Anne Frank Remembered"".

The supporting cast is first-rate.  Paul Schofield (CARVE HER NAME WITH PRIDE) is perfect as Otto, with Huub Stapel as Miep's husband Jan, Eleanor Bron as Edith Frank and Lisa Jacobs as Anne.  Quality TV movie.",1110844800,6,857,4.789115646258503
475431,5,6302516544,"Mary Steenburgen gives a deeply sympathetic and loving portrayal of Miep Gies, the woman who hid Anne Frank and her family during the German occupation of Holland.
The subdued color until the final bright scene, the music, the low key acting with only one dramatic outburst in the film, all give the feeling of great oppression.  The horror of being occupied by foreign power in your own country is constantly portrayed.  Juxtaposed to this oppression is the strength, courage, and love of one woman.
Anne Frank herself isn't portrayed as the beautiful child we've seen in other versions.  She is rather plain and quiet, but there are scenes when she does blossom out as one mature for her years with her own sense of strength and courage.
We don't, of course, see the whole story of the Franks, because the focus here is on the woman, Miep Gies.  The movie is based on a book by the woman, a book I hope to read in time.
This is not exactly an entertaining movie, nor is it a morbid or dreary experience.  It does portray not only the plight of the Jews, but also the plight of the Dutch people.  And it is good that we emphasize with the people of that time.  Present generations don't realize that it could have happened here.  If a few battles had gone another way, if Hitler had paid more attention to Rommel, our history could have been drastically and unimagineably changed.  And so it is good for us to watch what a captive nation is like.
No, this isn't entertainment in its strictest sense, but it does have an uplifting feeling at the end and is quite worth the watching, to make an understatement.",1024531200,19,1609,4.520689655172414
475432,5,6302516544,"This movie focuses a lot on Meep, played very well by Mary Steenburgen. It tells the story of the Franks from before they move into hiding to their capture and deportation. While it does not cover as broad a time span as the recent tv movie about Anne Frank, it does give a pretty accurate portrayal of the lives of those involved in the hiding of some Jews in a hidden annex.",998697600,3,376,4.236111111111111

475572,4,6302516544,"This Yorkshire Television production made in 1987 portrays the tragedy of the Frank family and their friends during their years hiding from the Nazis and almost certain death from the perspective of the brave Dutch couple Miep and Jan Gies who courageously supported them.  Based on Miep's book, this gives a different aspect of the event as seen from the outside, whereas the original play and the brilliant film by George Stevens provides us with the story as told by Anne and her fellow captors.  Both are excellent films and compliment each other beautifully and will outrage you with man's inhumanity to his fellow man.  A superb actor, Mary Steenburgen is just right as Miep, displaying a wonderful mixture of confusion, compassion, anger and bravery, risking her own well being to save others.  Paul Scofield, a sadly under represented actor in films and television, is excellent as Otto Frank, a decent honourable man and who will become the only member of his family to survive. And the strong supporting cast includes Eleanor Bron as the resolute Mrs. Frank and Lisa Jacobs, touching as the movie loving, budding writer Anne.  This telefilm has its limitations but its powerful message hits the mark and will bring you to tears.
The script by William Hanley won a well-deserved Emmy and principal nominations went to Steenburgen, Jacobs and director John Erman as well as the production, nominated for Best Outstanding Drama.
This fine film is an excellent primer for the magnificent 1959 film ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", directed by George Stevens.",1409702400,3,1558,5.023255813953488

475574,5,6302516544,"Wonderful focus on a courageous woman. Mary Steenburgen's portrayal of Miep is excellent. She shows courage and fear at the same time. Her love for the Frank family is evident in this movie. The tension of getting the family to the hiding place is well acted; the same with the visit to the butcher, and her daily trek to the hiding place.  Her anguish on August 4 when they are discovered makes you sad for all of them as is her desperate plea to pay for their freedom. Great movie with a different focus on the Anne Frank sad story.",1407283200,3,534,4.34
475575,5,6302516544,"This movie originally aired on NBC as a Hallmark Gold Crown Movie in the 80's.  The movie is centered on the character, Miep Gies, who was a secretary to Otto Frank and his partner, Mr. Van Damme.  Mrs. Gies was originally from Austria, but had settled in Amsterdam.  When the Frank's and the Van Damme's received their letter to show up to the Nazi's, they took refuge in ""the attic"" just above the business office of Mr. Frank and Mr. Van Damme.  Mrs. Gies and her husband, Jan, cooked food for the families and kept their presence concealed from everyone else.  Mrs. Gies died about 3 year ago at the age of 101, but this story showed the feelings of the people of Amsterdam against the Nazi's during the occupation.  This is probably the closest portrayal of the Anne Frank Story you will ever see as this was brought to light by someone who personally knew the Franks. This would be good to show kids from age 12 up (middle school) when explaining what the Nazi Occupation was in history class.",1407196800,,999,4.49171270718232

I show it every year to my 8th graders after we read the book. Miep was an amazing person, and it is nice that this movie honors her as well as Anne.",1364515200,,317,3.8615384615384616

475579,5,6302516544,"This is a very good depiction of the people who actually hid them. There are many versions on Ann Frank but none on the Heises.

There is no one actor or actress that I can say was the best. They were all excellent and they could not have done a better job of it. It made me feel both sad and angry. Sad because of what happened in that time and angry for the same reason.",1151366400,,372,3.8947368421052633

Kids today can't relate to the horrors of something like the Holocaust, and providing as much background knowledge as possible is critical. This movie very closely follows the story of the Franks and the other people in the Secret Annexe as it was told by Miep Gies. It gives the perspective of those who bravely hid Jews from the Nazis. My students are in awe of those who so willingly risked their lives for the sake of others.",1139875200,15,565,4.4423076923076925
