7344139,5,B0128QAXLO,"Americans should purchase this DVD from the Canadian site for $29.99 (Canadian Funds) due to the current great exchange rate!
Anyway, this was another great season showcasing the great cast, beautiful scenery and the absorbing family stories we've come to expect. I was particularly happy that season 8 ended on such a happy note for Ty and Amy. Seeing Mrs. Bell again was great (I think they need to bring Mrs. Bell back occasionally) but I missed not seeing Mallory.
I always watch the show on CBC (season 9 just started last weekend) and it already looks like a great new season. I always purchase the DVD's and enjoy the cast interviews about the season.",1444262400,81,658,4.730434782608696

7344182,5,B0128QAXLO,"You do not want to miss the incredible ten seasons of Heartland. Yes, it is a great family series, but this designation may turn off many people. It is not sappy and its warmth it genuine and often a product of struggle. Heartland has done something that no other series has done. It has created a family-centered multi-generational story that is layered and can be enjoyed for the magnificent scenery, great acting, the complexity of family and romantic relationships, the interesting stories and more. One can love Nordic Noir and also be challenged by the ten seasons of Heartland. The only negative thing I can say that it finally ended and I am fairly sure I will never find another show this magnificent. If anyone is aware of a comparable show, please post it.",1489708800,,767,4.731343283582089

Unfortunately, this season was never yet aired in the USA but after watching seasons 1-6 on Netflix, I've taken to buying the discs. I love Heartland. Very simple.

I'm not going to review further because there are enough reviews to tell you what this show is about but just know it is worth every penny and every second. This is a show you'll want to watch with your buddies, kids, spouse, or show off at a party. Become a part of the Heartland community!

A warm family show. In a ranch near Calgary, Alberta. Down to earth. So real. Real. Real. Authentic. Incredibly good actors. Real.

**SPOILERS**

Oh and I assume you know Ty and Amy actually get married in the last episode??? Wow, amazing things can happen!

As it turns out, she is making better use of it than they do.  I intend on purchasing the complete set for her by Christmas.  In my area, UPs is the only station that is carrying this and it comes on only once per day at 5 AM..........If you're looking for good family entertainment, this is the one.  Great cast of characters for starters.  I believe Amazon Prime Video carry's  this but only covers the first three years.  Netflix covers the first six years.",1464307200,2,728,4.255474452554744

Great stories and beautiful locations have been consistent(Along with great acting by the main cast)in the history of this Canadian series. So why only 4 stars? I would rate the season 5 stars for content, but only 1 star for DVD picture quality. I don't understand why a show filmed in High Definition would have such poor transfers to DVD. When I stream the past season available on Netflix(Seasons 1-6)the picture quality is exceptional, and the beautiful Canadian Rockies where the show is filmed comes alive with vibrant colors and detail, but on these DVD transfers the picture quality is a dull and blurry mess.

One major drawback, otherwise a ""5 star""  There is enough heartbreak in the world and for them to split Lu and Peter, took it to a soap opera level, away from the wholesomeness.  All the others were good until they got rid of Ashley and the mom/daughter of the town restaurant, Maggie's, and the single mom of the other horse farm.  Just can't think of some of their names right now.  I can't forget Mallory though, she made the show as much as any of the actors.",1458000000,,484,4.333333333333333

character deals with the challenges in their lives.  I love seeing how they help each other, sometimes hurt
each other, other times help each other heal.

7344634,5,B0128QAXLO,"Keeps up the high standard.  It is great to see a story developing along with the ages of the characters.  The people are so believable they become family very quickly.  It is wonderful to see Canadian productions on the other side of the world, the Americans would have ruined it with sex and violence, this is suitable for all ages from quite young children to aging people who remember when life was so much more pleasant.  I have met all of these people one way or another in my life, they all mean well, sometimes get it wrong, mostly get it right and either tolerate each other's frailties or  find a way to deal with them without major conflict.  I can't wait for season 9.",1447977600,16,680,4.4

7344642,5,B0128QAXLO,"This is such a great show! Perfect for family and kids to watch together. It does deal with some adult issues sometimes (divorce, separations, gambling, etc) but honestly, for me, I'm ok with that because it's life. It's reality and it happens and while my little kids don't get what's going on, my older ones do and they can see the relationships that are working (Amy and Ty, Jack and Lisa) and can see the ones that struggle (Tim and any girl he's with, Lou and Peter) and can start to put together (through talking with us) what went wrong and how even the people that struggle still work and fight to keep what they have. And then, of course, there are the horses and other animals and that's a huge part of the show as well that's fun to watch. I also like that Amber Marshall (Amy) really does know her stuff when it comes to the horses and animal care and it shows in her acting. It's very instructive and authentic.",1447632000,37,924,4.3468208092485545
