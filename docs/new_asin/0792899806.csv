Anthony M. Hall in the part that he was  born to play.  Robert Downey didn't even have a script, which is nice.

158119,5,0792899806,To see Michael Anthony Hall transform from a nerd to a highly valued football star is great.  Be careful because it is not for kids,1438560000,,131,4.24
158120,3,0792899806,"I always enjoyed Anthony Michael Hall in the numerous John Hughes movies he was involved in. He may not have held center stage but he came across as an actor that melded into the group picture being presented in such a way that he actually helped everyone else on screen with him. When he stepped out of the supporting roles and took on the lead something happened, and not in a good way.

An early outing as the lead for Hall was JOHNNY BE GOOD, a comedy that revolved around his being the football hero of a high school being scouted out by various colleges around the country. I understand that we need to suspend belief when watching films but after years of playing the weak dork in movies to suddenly become the high school stud just felt too quick and too forced.

The problems Johnny faces all revolve around his talents and those that want to take advantage of them. His coach (Paul Gleason) wants him to go to a particular school because hell get rewarded with a coaching job there as well, and hell do anything he can to make sure Johnny goes there. His family wants him to get a good education. His girlfriend (Uma Thurman) wants him to follow her to State so the two of them can stay together. Something tells me before the film ends hell make the right decision.

Along the way each of the colleges that want Johnny court him in every way imaginable. The offers of money, of an easy schooling, of wine, women and song are all tossed his way. Its as if the movie wants to be an indictment of the way colleges try to recruit talent for their sports teams but never enough to take on the topic seriously when theres a way to toss in a gross out joke or a topless coed instead.

While watching this new to blu-ray release I remembered watching it back when it was first released. Even then I felt that it was the usual teen fodder that seemed to follow in Hughes huge footsteps, movies that though the teen movie craze was all about the most predictable laughs and where kids always seemed smarter than any adult found on screen. Perhaps thats the reason why nearly 30 years later it is Hughes movies that we continue to talk about and remember more fondly.

All of that being said I cant actually hate this film. Sure, its not up to the standard set in those classic movies but it does offer a chance to see starts like Hall, Gleason and Robert Downey Jr. (as Johnnys friend) reunited in another movie. It also provides some mindless fun if you're looking for something to watch. And its also a must have for collectors of everything made by any of the actors involved. Just know walking in that its not the greatest thing since sliced bread. Its just a fun movie that might remind more than one viewer of those days gone by when you walked up and down the aisles of the local mom and pop video store trying to find something to watch. And thats never a bad memory to have.",1436313600,,2884,4.353159851301116

158123,5,0792899806,"Always gets me pumped for football season! My dad says the same thing. Anyway just one of those corny, obscure, comedies from the 80's. Anthony Michael Hall was actually not a nerd, but a jock! And Robert Downey Jr. plays his best bud and is hilarious in this movie. Although he has a very small part, wish there was more of him in it. I wonder if they are best friends in real life? AMH plays a top high school football recruit that is deciding on where to go to college. The makers of this movie definitely poke fun at some big name college football programs. Being a fan of college football, I just loved that! When I think about it, there are very few football scenes, mostly at the beginning of the movie. Haven't seen it in a while, so i can't say for sure.  I also think it's Uma Thurman's debut film. She is a looker for sure and plays AMHall's girlfriend. Paul Gleason and Jennifer Tilly have roles in this movie as well!!  I can only see Gleason as the principal in the Breakfast Club. Haha. In Johnny Be Good he plays the head fb coach and Tilly is his wife.  This movie kind of reminds me of Wildcats meets Bachelor Party!! Kind of? A typical dude movie. Don't think my wife would watch it with me. Lol. The VHS version has the full cut, I believe.  The DVD is missing some scenes. Don't know why they did that? I know things need to be edited for digital transfer but wasn't the purpose of dvd's to cram full cuts of films because of more disk space as opposed to less content on VHS? Remember Schindler's List and JFK needing 2 VHS tapes to hold everything. And Johnny Be Good is a much shorter movie than those 2. At the time, I have noticed that happening to many movies transferred from VHS to DVD. Not sure if they do the same thing with blu-rays or 4k's?? Fans of either A.M. Hall and R.D. Jr. should definitely see this. Although, parents should be cautious with their kids seeing this cause there is some scenes not appropriate for children.",1424822400,,1962,4.308943089430894

158149,3,0792899806,"I played Uma Thurman's mother and Sheriff Elkins' wife. We were supposed to HATE Johnny, i.e. Anthony Michael Hall. He and Robert Downey Jr. were incredible goofballs on set, and you could never believe anything they said, so it was easy for me to be a viper onscreen. There was always a huge line of teenage girls outside Robert and Anthony's trailers, we had to shoo them away. We were all aware that our director, though a well-known cinematographer, was a first-time director. He joshed a lot with us all. Cool, but the movie was changed as we went along and it wreaked havoc. It was Uma Thurman's first film as well, as she was a model and 15-16 years old. Robert Downey tried to convince me his dad was a famous opera singer... Oh yeah, ""Eraserhead"" was an opera. Almost all the footage Robert did was on-the-spot improv, and he was brilliant at it. The monologue he has in the film was made up entirely on the spot, and Bud kept it. I told Robert I thought he'd be a brilliant serious actor. He looked at me, mask dropped, and he said, ""Have you heard of 'Less Than Zero?', and I told him I had. He said he'd been offered the script, and was thinking of taking it. He did, and it made his career. All in all, this is one stupid film... But that's what makes it so dang funny, and such a classic. All the performers became film luminaries. If you insist on seeing the cheerleaders (who were in reality all strippers from a local men's club) flash the sheriff, then look around, you may find it. But they aren't on this version.",1351900800,9,1533,4.363636363636363

158162,2,0792899806,"This movie was about American high school football at its height of 80s corruption and destructiveness. Of course we see that today (look at the Sandusky scandal) but it was the 80s when this stuff really took off--throwing money at kids who couldn't or refused to apply themselves in something other than playing, sex, and money. Anyway supposedly Johnny was not one to fall for this (which is a farce) as he was ""true"" to his girlfriend (a young Uma Thurman . . . who is not a very attractive young girl by the way). . . . Anyway he is wined and dined and in the end ""does the right thing"" (which again is very very unrealistic for the subject matter). The story is a stereotype at this point . . . the poor football player needing the big college ""ride"" to support his family etc. Anyway the only good thing about this is to see a young chubby Robert Downey Jr. And to see as always a good looking Anthony Michael Hall.",1330214400,,922,4.304597701149425

158164,5,0792899806,"Johnny Be Good is your typical 80's film. Goofy, funny, dumb, be loved, and finally, ending with a positive note.

In the movie, Anthony Michael Hall plays Johnny, an All-State QB who is being scouted by the top universities in the country (they don't mention the actual school, but they do reference them pretty good).

At all the schools, he get's perks like women, cars, money, clothes, etc.

But there is no school that he likes that gives him nothing because they don't do that.

All the meanwhile, Johnny's actions are being recorded by an undercover College football investigator out to expose all the illegal activities that the schools are going through to land Johnny.

Overall, the movie is solid. It's funny, goofy, and it's got a very young Uma Thurman and Robert Downey Jr included.

I also liked that Anthony Michael Hall could actually throw the football, lots of movies get people who can't even throw a football 10 yards, but Anthony's got skills. You can tell he played football.",1294704000,2,998,4.807017543859649
158165,2,0792899806,"I got the wrong Anthony Michael Hall movie by mistake. I wanted 'Johnny Be Good' a comedy that co-stars Robert Downey, Jr. and Uma Thurman (in her film debut) but instead I got 'The Dead Zone'- no laughs and horrendously bad performances from a couple of stiffs. Each one of the three leads are incredibly likable and versatile, in other  movies, so it's disappointing they couldn't bring some sort of life to their idiotic characters. Hall sleepwalks through his role mumbling all of his dialogue so that it's barely intelligible and Downey Jr. is so over-the-top it's grating and even painful to watch. I'm not implying anything, but both men had well documented substance problems around the time the movie was made. Maybe that would explain some of the more confusing and bizarre aspects of their performances. Thurman isn't given anything more to do than look beautiful as Hall's girlfriend and throw a couple of tantrums whenever her immature boyfriend misbehaves, which is often.

Johnny Walker (Hall) is a star high-school football player who finds himself bombarded with offers from college scouts who all want him to play for their teams. Promised endless amounts of money, girls, fame, and apartments, Johnny can't decide where he should go. His best friend Leo (Downey Jr.) isn't good enough to make it on his own so his only hope is to convince Johnny to go to UCC where both men are guaranteed spots on the team. The boy's obnoxious coach Hisler (Paul Gleason), has his own motives for convincing Johnny what college to attend. If he can get Walker to sign with Piermont University, Hisler will get the head  coaching job. Unable to make up his mind Johnny goes on several campus tours where he sees everything but the campus. Tons of cheerleaders, hookers and strippers make themselves readily available for Johnny and four other draft picks. When he gets back from these tours his girlfriend Georgia (Thurman) is none too happy to learn of her boyfriend's indiscretions. Georgia wants Johnny to go to college with her so that they'll stay together. What's a boy like John to do? The film doesn't attempt to come up with answers, instead trafficking in stereotypes and cliches. None of the characters or situations they find themselves in are believable at all. This is one disposable 80s flick that's notable only for being Uma's first movie. Other than that, there's nothing worth recommending.",1271030400,2,2411,4.933497536945813
158166,2,0792899806,"2 of 5 stars to the 1980's typical teen comedy movie Johnny Be Good. To the movies credit, it has several young actors who turn out to be name-brand people. How about Uma Thurman? Robert Downey Jr? Anthony Michael Hall? So that was good.

The plot is about a high school football star who is trying to decide which college to attend. So, we follow AM Hall as his character visits several colleges who each roll-out the red carpet with VIP perks to get him to decide in their favor. The whole thing would be OK if you can possible believe that Hall COULD be a football star. My thinking is that on his first tackle, he'd be broken-up into little parts. He simply was not believeable as a star player.

So, the movie was mildly funny with the usual plot twists and gags. Nothing special to recommend this movie. As I said at the start, a typical 1980's style comedy. Oh, it had too much 1980's synthesized music--my head hurts.

It is truly one of the most overlooked 80's film ever (this and Emilo Estevez's brilliant directorial debut, ""Wisdom"")and actually contains one of the 3 inspired performances Robert Downey Jr has commited to film (Johnny Be Goode, Less than Zero and Weird Science).
 I was extremely glad to see this finally released on DVD, but MGM has mislabled this version as ""R"" rated.  This is a glaring and lazy oversight.  This DVD version is actually the ""PG-13"" theatrical version. Once ""Johnny Be Goode"" came out on video, it was released with extended footage in an ""R"" rated version.  It contained more nudity and showed a great deal more footage of Johnny's visit with ""Ole Tex"".  I know this sounds crazy but this particular version of the movie helped enhance the other ""Ole Tex"" candidates roles quite a bit and showed why they backed Johnny's ultimate decision towards the end of the movie.
 I believe MGM should correct this lazy mistake by either releasing the actual ""R"" rated version or re-labeling this version as ""PG-13"".",1079654400,17,1172,4.796019900497512

There's a scene in the movie where Johnny is playing football to win back his girlfriend from her father, during the game 3 cheerleaders flash the cops to distract them. This has been edited and all that is shown is them starting to lift their shirts then it cuts quickly to the next scene. Now I didn't buy this movie for the nudity but censorship in any form is just unforgivable especially when it's unnecessary because all the other scenes containing nudity (that I can remember) are intact. Though more scenes could have been edited I'm not sure. The DVD extras include only one trailer for the movie, so it's basically barebone which I expected it to be. I still suggest you buy this DVD the quality is excellent just a little warning it's not the original.",1070150400,21,950,4.434285714285714

Though it does have it's moments, it is nothing near some of his other 80s films such as ""16 Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club.""  If you're looking for a cheesy but fun 80s movie, try ""Love Bites,"" a very funny and silly vampire movie with Adam Ant.
OK, maybe I shouldn't complain about being disappointed...after all, the premise of the movie isn't very exciting.  Johnny is a highschool senior and football star who has all the top football schools after him.  Basically the movie is about his visiting the different schools and the various ways they try to ""bribe"" him to go there.  Meanwhile, there is a tiny amount of conflict with his girlfriend, played by Uma Thurman (this is her first role), about his going to State with her.  Johnny's friend, played by Robert Downey, Jr., is supposed to add some more comedy to the movie (at least I think so), but he is so bizarre it's hard to even laugh at him.
Basically my problem with this movie is that it really isn't all that funny; and it doesn't have much of a plot.  I know, I know, what do you expect, it's a cheesy 80s flick.  Basically, I think there are many more great 80s movies out there than this one, even though I do have to admit that seeing AMH in that silly purple outfit is sort of funny.",1061424000,3,1403,4.369230769230769

Should Johnny take one of the tempting offers from scores of talent scouts or should he attend the local state college with his babe (Uma Thurman), giving up his football dream? Paul Gleason plays his dubiously motivated coach while Robert Downey Jr. is on hand as his amusing bud.

If you remember Hall from Sixteen Candles (1984) and The Breakfast Club (1985) you might think he would be too geeky to play a quarterback stud, but hes older here and more beefed up, not to mention 62. He and Downey Jr. have great chemistry and the movie scores pretty well on the feminine front with Thurman in her debut, as well as Jennifer Tilly, Hayley Ladner (Juicy Dorfman) and some other peripherals. On the other side of the spectrum, Steve James is a stunning example of masculinity as the coach at the state college (too bad Steve died so young from cancer of unknown origin). Jim McMahon has a quality cameo.

While theres some semi-serious drama, the tone is often silly, but the movies kinetic and offers numerous laughs. Anyone who criticizes the film for being goofy might as well criticize water for being wet. Unfortunately the storys awkwardly uneven and there are curious lulls. If the script were tightened up this couldve been a hit in the 80s teen comedy genre.

Lastly, the flick features a fun rockin soundtrack with the likes of Judas Priests Johnny B. Goode, which plays over the end credits.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 31 minutes and was shot in the San Antonio area (Georgetown & Alamo Heights) and Texas Stadium, Irving (near Dallas).

7792702,2,0792899806,"The classic rock tune ""Johnny B. Goode"" features as the theme song...as interpreted by Judas Priest.  If that sounds like something you could enjoy listening to, then the movie probably won't offend you; that's about as close as I can come to recommending it.

Johnny Be Good is nothing more than a (very) discount John Hughes 80s teen flick, centering around star high school quarterback Johnny Walker (Anthony Michael Hall) and his far less athletically gifted best bud, Leo Wiggins (Robert Downey, Jr.).  As his senior year draws to a close, Walker faces an ethical crossroads as the big college football programs pull out all the stops to recruit him.  As if that wasn't enough, his high school coach (the late, great Paul Gleason) and Leo have a few ""recommendations"" to make as well.  Oh, if only Johnny had an 18 year-old Uma Thurman (as his girlfriend, Georgia) waiting at home to help guide his decision...oh, wait--he does.

There's nothing inspired here, there's nothing memorable (other than the theme song), and the decision to try to cram college football recruitment scandals into the plot line of a teen comedy was...curious?  If you're into those 80s teen period pieces then you've probably seen this already.  If you just discovered Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink, this is NOT nearly as good.  It's worth free if you're already a Prime member & considering streaming, but I would not recommend paying for this one.",1511568000,,1435,4.921161825726141
