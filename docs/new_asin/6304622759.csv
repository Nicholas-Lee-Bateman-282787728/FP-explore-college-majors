It is one of those really hokey plots.  Some sort of scheme to rip off a Swiss bank by pretending that their security was blown.  Blackmail.  Phony blackmail.  Nobody's security was blown.  There is no way of knowing anything about those Swiss bank accounts.

The part that really made me laugh, in fact the only good laugh in the movie, was when David Janssen had sex with one of the female characters.  It was so irrelevant to the plot.  It was just put in there because sex is part of the formula, so put some in there, however irrelevant.

And of course they don't show the sex.  They show the two of them in bed, but there's nothing even R rated going on.  It's all a lot of stupid nothing.  It is absurd to feel that such an empty sex scene adds something to the story.  It's just a base that they feel they have to touch.  Throw some sex in, but don't show anything of interest.

Maybe the people involved with the production of this film should be punished for making such a dumb film.",1136678400,11,1228,4.252173913043478
7874854,1,6304622759,"This dvd would be an okay runthrough of 60's drek if not for the jerky editing and the bleeped words.  The film was apparently obtained from a tv distribution company which has bleeped out some of the words for a tv  showing.  It may not bother all, but I find it maddening.  None of the  stars is at their best here.  In fact, I've never seen John Saxon this bad.  I wish more care had been taken with the release--as it is, I keep wanting  to pitch my copy out.  Simitar has done much, much better elsewhere.",949363200,17,510,4.175257731958763
