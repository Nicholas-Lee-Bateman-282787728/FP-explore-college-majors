Movie description
Master of diguise Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith (George Peppard), con man Lt. Templeton Peck ""Faceman"" (Tim Dunigan, replaced by Dirk Benedict in the regular series), master mechanic Sgt. Bosco ""B.A"" Baracus (Mr. T) and the superb - if not somewhat insane - Pilot Capt. H.M. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock (Dwight Schultz), All Vietnam Veterans, band together to offer their services to the Highest Bidder. In the Two-Hour Premiere, The A-Team must help free a reporter being held by Mexican Guerrillas.

Amy Imelda is a beautiful young journalist who has decided to defy her newspaper's orders by trying to locate Al Massey, a colleague who has dissapeared in Mexico during an assigment. After several clandestine meetings with Smith (Hannibal), who appears in various theatrical disguises, she persuades the members of The A-Team to take on her job. Together they swindle a jet and fly to Acapulco, where they begin by searching for Manny Cortez, Al Masseys's local contact.

In part two, having found Manny Cortez, The A-Team learns of a drug lord, named Malavida Valdez. Valdez who enslaved the town of San Rio Blance, has also captured and improsoned Al Massey.
