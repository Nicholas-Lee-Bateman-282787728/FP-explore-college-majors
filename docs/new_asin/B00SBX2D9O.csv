6979634,4,B00SBX2D9O,"If you liked the first film, you should like this one. This is also done in a grindhouse style combining a martial arts film with a hip-hop soundtrack. Part 2 gives you the ending of previous film, which I found to be a confusing mess anyway. You don't have to have seen the first film to enjoy this one, it gives you enough information.

The silver mine is run by Master Ho (Carl Ng) who has enslaved the village to his will with his Beetle Clan. Li (Dustin Nguyen) speaks for the miners and is also a good fighter. Thaddeus (RZA ) gets his butt beat early in the film on his quest to find redemption, Buddha, and inner peace. He and his iron fists float up to the village.

There is also a string of murders happening to young girls. They are getting their chi stolen from them. Rumor claims it is the spirit of Lord Pi who died in the first film. There is the Golden Nectar pool guarded by monks for immortality. They eased up on the plot aspect.

The film boasts plenty of fighting, head rolls, blood squirts, and an exploding body.

6979655,2,B00SBX2D9O,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Being a fan of martial arts films I was looking forward to the release of the first MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS. Everything Id seen in the trailers looked fun and amazing. When the movie came out I went to the theater to see it and laughed throughout the entire film. It was fun! It delivered on all counts just what I was expecting from the film. The same cant be said of this film.

A number of the main characters from the first film are nowhere to be seen here, most notable the one played by Russell Crowe. My memory may be off but it appears the only one to actually show up is RZA as Thaddeus, the iron fisted combatant from the previous film. While I encourage RZA for his enthusiasm for the genre as well as his love of it, he doesnt have the ability to carry the entire film on his singular shoulders and that becomes the biggest flaw here.

On his way to where his training began to pay homage at the temple there, Thaddeus is attacked by old enemies and left for dead. Drifting down the river he is found wounded and near death near a village where a husband and wife take him in and help heal him. The husband works in the nearby mines run by the Beetle clan. Those who work in the mines are treated like dogs and have no hope left in them.

At the same time the majority of those working in the mines are members of the Praying Mantis clan and they plan on changing things when the opportunity presents itself. As things heat up, Thaddeus chooses to side with the Praying Mantis clan and when the fighting starts his iron fists come in handy.

So to begin with the convoluted plot here seems far too intricate for what were watching. Keeping characters separated becomes a chore and the bad guys seem far to Snidely Whiplash like while the good guys seem to take far too much before they rebel. The martial arts sequences aren't the worst Ive seen but there have been far many that were better. Above all the worst fight sequences involve RZA whose style of fighting makes that performed by David Carradine on the old KUNG FU TV series look fast. Instead of fighting most of his moves involve using the fist to pummel his opponents and to do so with plenty of blood packs there to shoot forth.

Look, like I said, I admire RZA for trying to keep the genre alive. But there are so many out there doing such a better job of it that when something like this comes along it doesnt really help and actually sets things back a few years. Perhaps he was trying for the campy fell of a homage to the grindhouse martial arts flicks of the seventies and eighties but if so he fails. While I loved the first one I would suggest passing on this one unless you really feel the need or are determined to see every martial arts film you can get your hands on. For myself the odds of my watching it again are fairly slim.",1441065600,,2871,4.249084249084249

6979682,4,B00SBX2D9O,"The Man with the Iron Fists 2 works in a manner that, notoriously, many sequels attempt but fail at miserably. It is solid entertainment throughout and it advances the journey of Thadeus ( played by the first films writer-director, The Rza, with the same gentle grace he displayed in the prior film but with more emotional range and a noticeably increased, yet still somewhat stiff, acting ability ) as he enters  a quarrying settlement and, when brought in to treat his injuries, finds himself fighting alongside the people of the community against Master Ho and The Beetle Clan in a manner that simultaneously continues the elements of the previous story and feels fresh and new. Wisely, this sequel also summons the introspective and minimalistic approach of the Martial Arts classics of Bruce Lee, also backed by the sense of a personal journey of transformation so prevalent in Lees work, and the old-fashioned adventurous feel of a many Jackie Chan vehicles throughout the years.

 Like the various films in Lees film canon, it puts the characters first. The dialogue drips with a wisdom similarly mirroring this legend of Martial Arts motion pictures. It takes its time to look into the hearts and souls of nearly everyone the story revolves around and never once does it feel forced or unnecessary. Such casual conversations make the raw and mostly believable action on-screen (set against a gorgeous backdrop which could be the setting for any number of Martial Arts classics, also another group of similarities between Lees motion picture style) all the more impactful. The actuality that the combative scenes are choreographed in a more natural fashion, and not in the overblow way they were in the initial entry, also provide further proof of this comparisons validity.

 As is the case with sequels, it isn't quite as good as the original but it comes admirably close. Often the director, Roel Reine, resorts to the tired maneuver of flashbacks, especially in the first half hour, to remind audiences of what has happened in the previous entry. As is usually the case with this, a symptom common in plaguing films two and higher since the birth of cinema, it weighs the overall impression of the film down because it feels like lazy storytelling. Luckily, this is reserved to a few instances before The Man with the Iron Fists 2 takes off in its last hour and goes as far out of its way not to repeat any ideas previously mentioned in the first movie (with the exception of the iron fists, of course) and goes off on its own course with excellent results.

 Even The Beetle Clan, who were also the villains of the first film, never at any point give off a sense of the exhaustion caused by these brief evocations because the emphasis on their wickedness isn't as harped upon as in the original and because we are given more to ponder by their motivations, the movie probes a little deeper into their actions, than sheer displays of their nefarious nature.

 The different setting, the more traditional approach to the direction (the original had more of a grindhouse vibe, often retreated to terrible C.G.I. effects which are non-existent and the motion picture is all the more credible because of it here, to it that worked well for what The Man with the Iron Fists was and what it wanted to accomplish but wouldve seemed repetitive in this more character oriented installment) all help this effort come very near the quality of the prior feature but, what is also noticeable is the soundtrack.

 The Rza's mixture of gritty Rap lyrics with more of a pulsating, oriental melody in the fifteen tracks which composed the first films background music made it one of the best Hip Hop recordings of its type in far too many years. In the sequel, The Rza, alongside Howard Dressin, mostly remixes a lot of the more potent songs over the early fight scenes (in a much-less brash, confrontational manner than he did in the previous entry) and it is at first disappointing, since he didn't utilize this as a chance to orchestrate all new music, but ultimately a respectful homage, a nice bridge that unites these two films. There is the addition of what sounds like slowed down, almost to the point of sounding like spoken word, to a strung out beat which is really inventive and works well with the atmosphere of this bit of cinema. It may not be as wholly unique as the first soundtrack but it certainly catches the attention of the ear every time the music sweeps across the screen (which is something you cant say about too many cinema scores in general these days).

 The screenplay, co-written by John Jarrell, also shows The Rzas increasing capabilities in that direction. Known for his deep, verbose rhymes on his solo albums and the timeless Hip Hop opuses he composed with the Wu-Tang Clan his screenwriting abilities were previously fair (the pace did lag a bit in the original and some of the dialogue was cringe-worthy but overall it was an inventive ride that didn't seem like the imitation it couldve easily been) and in The Man with the Iron Fists 2 The Rza presents a more well-rounded tale that never seemed to give us any filler and characters that were better realized.

Maybe in the third volume of The Man with the Iron Fists chronicles we will see his acting and story talent evolve to something that equals his lyrical capabilities in the writing department. Either way The Man with the Iron Fists is an incredible achievement for a follow-up. One cannot deny The Rzas abilities behind the camera but it was a smart move to let Reiner take this entry. The Rza has improved many of the visible faults of his last narrative endeavor. Lets hope he continued that tradition with whatever his next film he is associated with may be, whether it is The Man with the Iron Fists 3 or something wholly unique, a new cinematic world entirely.",1429056000,,5860,4.766272189349112
6979683,3,B00SBX2D9O,"The Man With The Iron Fists 2 was a slight improvement over the last film. SLIGHT BEING the KEY WORD!

In the film a group of mining villagers are under the ruthless control of the Beetle Clan, who are supposed to be protecting them. But instead, the clan is using them more like slave labor, where resistance often leads to mishaps in the mine, or plain out death for disobedience. Li Kang (Dustin Nguyen) is the spokesperson for the villagers. He tries to diffuse hostilities on his side. But eventually tensions reach a boiling point, when too many villagers are killed and some of the village women are found dead due to an unexplained condition. It basically sucks their lives from them.

Somewhere in this whole mess, Thaddeus, (RZA) arrives on the scene, when his unconscious body literally floats by the village river. He was knocked unconscious into the river due to a previous fight he had with a group that tried to kill him. He reprises his role as the blacksmith as he attempts to help the villagers resolve their problems with the Beetle Clan. A few twists and turns occur until the film reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well I have to say, this was a slight improvement over the last, Man With the Iron Fist, film. And it didn't even have the same outrageous budget. But none of it can be attributed to RZA, as his acting was stale again, and his presence had that same street flare, which didn't really fit. The main element that helped this film over the last one was a focused storyline, which was mainly about a power struggle in one particular village. A lot of credit also has to be given to Dustin Nguyen, who probably helped this film from becoming a total bomb. His acting is good and thankfully he carries most of the scenes that are worth any weight.

I am going to complain about the soundtrack again, and this is a RZA problem. RZA has two loves. Rap music and martial arts. For some reason, he thinks they go well together in Kung Fu films. While this was not as much a Kung Fu film as his last production was, the hip hop soundtrack was still very distracting. There would be times where I was getting into the film, and then an instrumental version of his hip hop style would fade up into the background, pulling me out thinking, this is RZAs influence. It was worse when you could hear actual rap lyrics.  And it wasn't even good rap on top of that. It was just there because RZA thinks its cool I guess. I don't really know. But if he does make a third film, he should understand hes making a period piece set in China, so his rap style doesnt fit. Even if he wants it too. It just doesnt.

However the other soundtrack, which was more generic in nature, was less distracting. It should have been used the whole time in my opinion.

Anyway, the fights were just so, so this time. Id say they were better in the last film. And in the unrated version, you get fake looking death scenes, where heads fly off and a few arms are dismembered. They were more distracting than anything else, so I saw them as unnecessary.

The rest of the cast was a mixed bag. Carl Ng played the main antagonist and did a fare job. He seemed too nice to me at first, but grew on me after a while. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa also appeared as the village mayor. Hes getting older now, but he did OK. Hes not able to fight like he once did in the first Mortal Kombat film from the 90s. But at least he can act and he did what he could to help this film.

In the end, Im giving this film a three. It was slightly better than the last film. RZA made a good choice by having less scenes of himself in the overall movie and including more scenes with Dustin Nguyen. He didn't learn his lesson on the music. But if he makes more Iron Fist movies, he's better off limiting his onscreen presence, so the seasoned actors can tell the story. He improved a little, but he still has a ways to go. A possible rental at best. Maybe a couple of viewings at most.",1428969600,3,3964,4.3243606998654105

After being found near death a stranger is given shelter inside a village tensions begin to rise. The mayor of the town sends his people to take over the small village. The stranger begins to help fight him off and when the now peaceful blacksmith (RZA) shows up the odds begin to swing. I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of martial arts movies and liked the first one OK but didn't think it needed a sequel. I don't really remember too much of the first one, but this one seemed to have more of a story to it. A little cheesy in some parts but watchable and entertaining.
