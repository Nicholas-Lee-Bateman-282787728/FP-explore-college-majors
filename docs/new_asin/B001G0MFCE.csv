When they started putting tv classics on DVD,I had to take her to best buy to get Season One! At first I was like..what kind of show is this?? I don't recommend any child too see this due to the violence. But in.time this seris grew on me. I loved Cam Allision..he was sooo cute! Youngfellow stole my heart! Frank Nitti is a loveable villian! Yet,Robert Stack.with his smooth style,his sexy.looks and his wit and loyalty to his family and the law makes this show a hit! But This DVD is.one.of the best!

I have order all of the Untouchable seasons for my Father over the last year. He and I both love watching the Untouchables.  This skipping has happened even on some of the used Untouchable disc's I purchased last year.  I have not had this issue happen with other disc's from different movies.

3590760,5,B001G0MFCE,Here we go with season three of an excellent series on crime in the USA in the late 1920's and the 1930's.  Life in those times could be quite brutal if you got caught up in the world of crime and Al Capone.  This is part one of the third season.  A good one to own.,1383955200,,266,3.7142857142857144
3590761,5,B001G0MFCE,"I just love watching The Untouchables. While it is true that Elliot Ness never even really fired a shot from his gun and all of this is fictionalized to make him the #1 crime fighter, when prohibition was over he was out of a job, and the only real accomplishment of his was getting Al Capone on tax evasion I think, it is good television. The events were in fact true. But, not quite the way they are portrayed here. History is though, something that you tell in either one of three ways; the truth, a lie, or you embellish it a bit. And that is what was done here but it don't matter. It made good TV. Even Peter Falk (Columbo) was in two episodes. That was good to watch.",1380499200,2,674,4.152671755725191

Hopefully series 4 will also become available in due time.
Selling products of this nature will serve you well in the future.

3590830,5,B001G0MFCE,"The third season for many series can be a turning point. It can settle in and run on pure formula, in which case it will start to sink in the ratings.  It can ""jump the shark,"" have actor issues and simply implode. Or, it can do what the great series do - up the ante.  Check out the third season of any long-running, accomplished series - it is invariably the best.  Season One feels its way, season two establishes relationships and routines, and season three?  Well season three stretches the formula.  And that's what happens here.

Corruption moves perilously closer to Ness in Season Three.  Peter Falk does a masterful turn painting Ness as a bad cop with the help of a crooked newsman. Watching Stack act drunk and depressed in this episode is alone worth the price of the DVD. We actually meet Ness's old partner (Martin Balsam) who now works for the mob.  The dialogue between the two is terrific and Balsam is simply outstanding. I think Scorsese ought to watch The Genna Brothers episode and make a movie from it.  The quality of the black and white filming is amazing, better than any film noir movie you ever saw.  These episodes are verging on true art.

Nit picks?  Guys who had names like Rodini in seasons one and two are now named Rader (in deference to previous outrage from Italian-Americans)and the guys sitting around Nitti's table at the Montmarte are now named Sidney, Melvin and Arnold (oy!!) Ness and Hobson running in place in front of a screen of the Tunnel of Horror is a bit cheesy.  BUT....Steve London, as Rossman, actually gets some lines!!!

Still...lots of smoking, drinking and method acting galore.  And the reperatory company is still in place, with some actors (Nehemiah Persoff, Jack Warden, Will Kuluva, Steve Cochran, Joe Wiseman, etc) back for the 4th or 5th time since the start of the series.  And time?  Well, it's STILL not linear, but who cares??  You can watch this stuff for hours!!  More, please!",1251417600,21,1948,4.676470588235294
3590831,5,B001G0MFCE,"CBS Home Entertainment is certainly fast-tracking the release of Season 3 as Volume 1 is out now and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Untouchables-Season-Three-Vol-2/dp/B001G0MFQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Untouchables - Season Three, Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;is due out in November, 2009.  Yes, the half season sets are a bit pricey but each episode is a whopping 50+ minutes long compared to today's 41.5 minute ""hour long"" show.  This S.3-V.1 release contains 16 episodes and just check out the guest star list of future A-List Emmy & Oscar winners plus a whose who of character actors, including:

Murray Hamilton, Ned Glass, Vincent Gardenia, Peter Falk, Albert Salmi, Carroll O'Connor, Wendell Corey, Martin Balsam, Don Gordon, Marc Lawrence, Arlene Martel, Telly Savalas, Jack Klugman, Martin Landau, Gavin MacLeod, Cloris Leachman, Anne Helm, Mike Kellin, Harold J.

Plus many, many more!  And that's just Volume 1.

Again, my only complaint is CBS/Paramount's decision to keep going with plain, gray discs instead of picture discs.  But the audio is crisp and the video has good gray-scale resolution.  All four discs are again contained in a single clear keepcase for easy storage in your DVD library.  Enjoy!",1251331200,10,1473,5.813953488372093

3590835,5,B001G0MFCE,"Retro television shows have never done particularly well unless they were set in the Old West. Shows set in the 20's, 30's, 40's, etc, any era outside of the one in which they aired have never lasted long except in three major exceptions - Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and The Untouchables.

The Untouchables succeeded for a number of reasons. First, the veil that had been on the Mafia for a number of years was slowly but surely being peeled off due to gangland killings and the fame of gangsters such as Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, and others. Even before the Godfather and its outstanding first sequel, the public had a fascination and curiosity with the mob. So take some true events, ture characters, heavily fictionalize them with Hollywood gloss and pathos, and you get a very successful show that made a star out of Robert Stack and brought new fame to a Treasury agent named Eliot Ness.

The Untouchables' collection should not have been split up into multiple sections. That's greed, pure and simple. But the lure of this show - its great characters, performances, grit and intelligence will draw buyers even though they know they're being ripped off. Stack's Ness is one of the best alltime detectives - fearless, relentless, and absolutely ruthless with the bad guys. The supporting casts were always excellent, and Bruce Gordon brough the right amount of humor and menace to Frank Nitti, Capone's chief lieutenant.

The Untouchables - Season Three, Volume 1 is not untouchable, but it is irresistable.",1244851200,2,1544,4.930769230769231
