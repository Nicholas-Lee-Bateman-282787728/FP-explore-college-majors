7864770,5,630418932X,"I have a few Monkees episode videos and I like this one best! The first episode,Monkees mother,is awesome! Rose Marie moves in with the boys,and they go from disliking the lady to loving her. The sweetness of the Monkees and the 2 great songs they perform add up to a winner. The second episode where our boys teach a bratty boy(Butch Patrick) the value of Christmas and friendship is good too. If only the world were as sweet and loving as our Monkees........",988934400,2,460,4.554216867469879
7864771,5,630418932X,"Two wonderful stories, both of which bring tears to the eyes at one point or another.  Rose Marie puts her finger unfailingly on what's special about each of the boys, and Mike and Peter's stalwart holiday cheer shines like  the star on top of their $20 Christmas tree.  I've never heard a more  beautiful rendition of ""Riu, Riu, Chiu.""",932860800,9,336,4.6440677966101696
