3832338,4,B0021L8V0W,"Salt is not what you would call a masterpiece, or even on the same level as the similar Bourne films, but thanks to Angelina Jolie, it's just entertaining enough. She carries this movie on her skinny shoulders. What's up with her lack of weight? She looked great back in the Tomb Raider days, now she looks like a twig. I guess she's still a little sexy, but that's mainly due to her on-screen presence and butt kicking attitude. She and Milla Jovovich don't really look the part at first glance, but both have become the two main female action stars on the planet. The only difference being that Jolie has a much wider range with her acting talent.

The plot and writing are decent, but the whole Russia vs. the U.S. thing has been old for decades. There are a couple of neat twists along the way and early on you're not quite sure if Jolie's character is good or bad, so that keeps things interesting. I thought the storyline with her husband needed to be expanded upon, especially since his character is vital in changing the mindset of an important individual. The action scenes are well shot and violent for PG-13, with Jolie taking out countless armed guards with ease. Her acting ability and body control makes it all the more believable. You also get a lot of real stunts and very little CGI, which is always welcomed.

Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor (dude needs a harder name to pronounce) are the only other main characters. They are both okay, but only a certain one gets to shine a bit more towards the end.

Salt leaves room for a sequel or two. I read that this movie was originally written for Tom Cruise, so with the writing geared toward Angelina Jolie in future installments, I think they can be even better.

3832339,5,B0021L8V0W,"This summer has had some outstanding summer movies, and Salt is one of them. It starts with Angelina Jolie in the title role, Evelyn Salt, a CIA spy. A Russian defector suddenly shows up at one of their front businesses. During questioning, he announces to one an all that the visiting Russian president will be assassinated - by Evelyn Salt, supposedly a deep-cover Russian spy. The fact that the 'defector' then kills two agents escaping the building never enters into some folks' wholehearted belief his story. They take her in for questioning, she busts loose (super-agent that she is), and the chase is on.

I really can't say anything else about the plot. There are so many reversals than anything would be a spoiler, and you deserve to see them for yourself. Of course, Jolie completely takes command of the role, and of pretty much everything else in sight. I'm sure it will surprise no one that the role was orginally written for a male actor ('Edwin,' not 'Evelyn') but, when it came time to cast the manliest action actor they could find, Jolie's name topped the list.

This movie stands well above its genre. There are plenty of fight scenes, some pretty amazing chases, and a satisfying ending that begs for sequels. More than just that, there's an actual plot, one that keeps you guessing almost (but not quite) to the end.

3832340,5,B0021L8V0W,"Now this is what I'm talking about. Phillip Noyce's ""Salt"" is my type of summer movie. First and foremost ""Salt"" is an action film and it succeeds with flying colors in that regard. But what I really admired about this picture is that it took place in reality. The action was grounded in physics and therefore made it messy, mean and hard hitting. Then we have bon-a-fied movie superstar Angelina Jolie in her best action performance. Where ""Salt"" also succeeds stupendously is with Evelyn Salt's characterization, which is complex, dualistic, fascinating and ultimately enigmatic. Jolie thrives in this role which plays to literally every one of her strengths as an actress. You root for her and sympathize with her even though it's never clear what side Evelyn truly falls into. It's in this intense dynamic between plot, character and action that leaves ""Salt"" head and shoulders over films like ""Eclipse"", ""Clash of the Titans"", ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" and yes, even ""Inception"". But also on a side note it's just plain refreshing to see a film that has Russians trying to take down America, crisp and clean action cinematography and a true movie star like Jolie leading things along. This is classic summer filmmaking at it's finest.",1279929600,148,1252,4.966666666666667
3832341,5,B0021L8V0W,"I went to see this movie not expecting it to be that good, but wanted something to do for the afternoon. But ""Salt"" actually exceeded my expectations. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a tough and smart CIA agent accused of being a secret mole working for Russian defectors and plotting to assassinate the president of Russia (during his visit to the U.S.), and later the President of the U.S. himself. Her superiors immediately try to apprehend her, but Salt escapes them and embarks upon an action-packed, car-smashing, stunt-driven chase thriller as she seeks to prove her innocense and wipe out her evil Russian accusers.

But is Salt really innocent? Is she really a Russian spy, or are others within her agency the real spies? This rollercoaster ride of adventure and suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing until the very end. In spite of the obvious holes in the plot and the implausible stunts, ""Salt"" delivers on action, suspense and entertainment, and Jolie plays the role superbly. Judging by the movie's ending, you can bet your bullets that there will be a ""Salt"" sequel. Can't wait 'til next summer!",1279929600,9,1135,4.850515463917525
3832342,4,B0021L8V0W,"Isn't it amazing how we play the entertainment card to make excuses for preposterous films? We as audiences will buy into a whole host of cinematic flaws as long as there are sights and sounds to keep us amused, and in all honesty, I don't know whether or not I mean that as a criticism. Maybe it's just what is. ""Salt,"" like so many summer action movies before it, is a fun thrill-a-minute stunt caper, and yet it possesses not a single shred of plausibility. It's one of those movies that gives you license to put your brain on autopilot; you're not supposed to question it, you're just supposed to enjoy it for what it is. I hope this isn't a copout on my part, considering all the other escapist summer films I've dismissed (""Eagle Eye,"" the ""Transformers"" films, ""The A-Team""). The fact that it's a spy thriller may have something to do with why it works. Tales of international intrigue involving secret agents are generally successful.

The plot: Trusted CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused by a Russian defector of secretly being a sleeper agent for the KGB, Russia's foremost internal security organization. He also says she will be involved in a plot to assassinate the President of Russia, who will be in New York City attending the funeral of the American Vice President. Although she denies the defector's claims, she realizes that she will be held against her will, which will endanger the life of her German husband, a spider scientist (a plot point that isn't as inconsequential as it might seem). Using every trick in the book, Salt escapes headquarters and goes on the run, claiming that she's out to clear her name. Pursuing her are Agents Winter (Liev Shreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor); the former is willing to believe her innocence while the latter is highly suspicious.

One of the film's most ridiculous yet clever story points is an elaborate decades-old scheme by the Russian government to brainwash children into being KGB agents. Their goal: Raise them to blend in, have them infiltrate the United States, and then let them bide their time until X Day, an operation that will plunge the country into nuclear war with the rest of the world. You'd be hard pressed to find a better sinister plot in a James Bond film, with or without the silly gadgets and gizmos built into wristwatches and ball-point pens. What does any of this have to do with Evelyn Salt? Wouldn't you like to know? Let's just say that, whatever her association, she gets to take part in many death-defying stunts, including impressive acrobatic leaps from the tops of semi trucks and gas tankers, all moving along at average freeway speeds.

Stories like this require a plot twist or two, and you'll get them both in ""Salt."" I will say that, given the formulaic nature of spy thrillers, the twists aren't all that surprising - one is, in fact, so predictable that I could tell it was coming as early as the first ten minutes. But what this movie lacks in surprises it more than makes up for in sheer action spectacle, aided greatly by decent casting choices. Jolie, still in her prime, has been amazingly versatile, with credits as diverse as ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" ""Changeling,"" ""A Mighty Heart,"" and ""Wanted"" to her name; it's always a good sign when an actor can convincingly touch you deeply in one movie and get your heart pounding in another. Schreiber and Ejiofor play fairly generic roles, but in all fairness, they do the best with what little they're given.

The only disappointment is Salt's husband, Mike Krause (August Diehl), who's featured so infrequently that I couldn't bring myself to care about him. This is bad because he is an important character, not merely because of his field of study, but also because of his emotional ties to Salt. Flashback sequences showing the two together should have been enough, but for me, something was missing. Maybe it was just a matter of too little screen time; had he been more actively involved, had he been given more dialogue, something substantial could have developed. As it is, I don't think anything of great importance would have been lost if this character had been altogether removed. Let the spider thing work itself in differently.

We need another mindless action film about as much as we need another reality show. But if they absolutely have to be made, then ""Salt"" is a good indicator of what they should be like. Yes, it's silly from start to finish. Yes, it doesn't bother with anything that's even remotely realistic. But boy, it certainly knows how to keep an audience entertained. The action is plentiful. The mystery is engaging. The characters are well-played. The suspense is palpable. It's a lot of fun. And here I go again, sliding that entertainment card from out my sleeve, slipping into a fairly weak hand. Are we too easily amused? Movies like this are enjoyable distractions, but I shudder to think this is all we have left when it comes to summer popcorn flicks. As is the case with real salt, too much isn't good for you - just a pinch will do.",1279843200,4,5055,4.746302616609784
3832343,4,B0021L8V0W,"The latest spy thriller to hit the box office, 'Salt', starring Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, written by Kurt Wimmer and Brian Helgeland, and directed by Philip Noyce, is a cat and mouse game with a plot straight from the good ol' days of James Bond that does what Bond used to do- entertain you.

The movie opens two years prior to current events with CIA operative Evelyn Salt (Jolie) being interrogated in a North Korean prison.  She's released in a prisoner exchange- against standard spy protocol- not so much at the behest of the CIA but the man who's her current cover assignment and love interest, Krause, a German arachnologist (spider biologist).

Fast forward to present times and on the day of her anniversary Salt and her supervisor Tom Winter (Schreiber) interview a 'walk-in'- a spy who literally hands themselves over- in the presence of Peabody (Ejiofor), from Internal Affairs.  This man, Orlov, spins a tale about the KA-12 Project: Russian sleeper agents trained since childhood and integrated throughout the United States in preparation for 'Day X', the deadliest covert strike against US Imperialism imaginable- beginning with the assassination of the Russian President on American soil.  The assassin's name... Evelyn Salt.

Orlov manages a bloody escape from custody, placing Salt squarely in the CIA's sights.  Now suspected of being a sleeper agent and her husband gone missing, Salt engineers her own escape and heads to New York where the Russian president will be appearing at a funeral service.  Despite Peabody and Winter leading the hunt, she manages to infiltrate the church.  Yet even after surrendering to the police she once again slips her captors, leading to even more questions: is Salt really a Russian sleeper agent?  Why has her husband disappeared?  Who are the KA-12 agents...?

The performances are pretty solid throughout; Jolie's desperation and determination, Schreiber's professional calm and Ejiofor's active disbelief all come off good- though Ejiofor sometimes looks constipated instead of cynical.  The pacing is good, too- with slices of Salt's life interspersed through the action to show us what she's fighting for.  And it's always good to see veteran actor Andre Braugher in anything, but like Laurence Fishburne in Predators, there wasn't anything for him to do other than collect a check.  The action sequences are impressive and inventive- Jolie gets down and dirty in this one and handles herself well (my personal faves were her takedowns of the two main bad guys and her creative use of a taser to escape the police).  Some of the scenes are reminiscent of earlier Bond films, or even MacGyver but it's all part of the fun.  The highway chase was clearly inspired by the one from Matrix Reloaded, but that's ok, too.

'Salt' is Jason Bourne-lite with lots of action and decent attention to detail, and even if the ending felt a bit rushed it's still pretty entertaining.  The only real downside is once the big plot twist is revealed, you already know the others.  But it's a fun ride and worth 90 minutes of your summer.  And for those of us who are a certain age, I won't even make any cracks about the sequel's potential title: Salt II...",1279843200,5,3225,5.00187265917603

3832387,4,B0021L8V0W,"Lots of confounding twists and turns in this spy film that combines elements of Alias, Die Another Day, The Bourne films, and Mission Impossible III. The most perplexing part of this movie is when Evelyn Salt's handler shows up at the CIA's masquerading office and outs his Russian protege, Salt. This sets the stage for the CIA to hunt Salt for the rest of this film. The underlying premise of this film is reminiscent of the first season of Alias (watch it). Key takeaways that are outstanding include Salt's MacGyverish use of a fire extinguisher to make an improvised RPG, a face mask, and stunts (i.e. scaling the outside walls of an apartment complex barefoot and jumping from semi-truck to semi-truck).
Overall, a good film, but not up to par as Alias.",1524873600,,759,4.757575757575758

The CIA tries to contain her as she is concerned that the Russians have her husband since the terrorist referenced her wedding ring during the interrogation. She escapes and tries to find her husband. From there there are some twists and turns in the plot. I don't know if I have action movie/spy movie overload but they are not wow moments. Just mildly entertaining ones. The movie uses the news about Russian sleeper spies being sent to the US as kids as the definition of its plot. I find the action sequences way over the top. No skinny woman is going to do all of what this actress does and live to tell about it let alone get back up off the ground and do more. That guy that plays the president is the same one back in the 1980s who was on Knots Landing. He is creepy old now. And runs like a girl which is kinda funny. Nothing else to really say here. There is some violence but it is mostly implied not visual. One interesting thing I found in the plot . . . but probably ignored my most . . . is she takes her dog before she goes on the run and drops him off with a little girl to watch over. I've always wondered what happens to pets when their owners die in car accidents, away from home, etc, esp after an uncle of mine died and was not found for 5 days. His dog had no water or food in 90 degree weather most of that time. Always on my mind now, too, when the power goes out. What about the pets?",1495238400,,1483,4.064846416382252

3832746,5,B0021L8V0W,"Angelina Jolie is one of the most beautiful women on Earth.
Some critics have called her ""regal"" while others have referred to her looks as ""elegant.""
Given that, it's always just a little bit surprising to me that she can pull off roles in which she is quite lethal as well.
""Salt"" is one of those movies that shows that she can be just as dangerous as Matt Damon playing Jason Bourne or Daniel Craig when he portrays James Bond; just as hardcore, in fact, as any male action star. As a sleeper agent working for the CIA, Salt is a highly skilled martial artist; someone who routinely combines several different fighting styles into a deadly combination. What makes her performance in this movie so good is the fact that there's nothing ""girly"" about the way she mixes it up with male opponents. Very few female actors can pull that off (Rebecca Ferguson does when she stars with Tom Cruise in ""Rogue Nation"" but not many others are as believable when they go one-on-one with a male actor.)
Her ability to be both beautiful and deadly in the same film is one of the reasons this movie is so enjoyable to watch. Another reason: It's damn near non-stop when it comes to action. The movie starts with Jolie being manhandled in a North Korean prison camp and it seldom pauses long enough to take a breath from that point on. In most movies that might not be a strong selling point, but thanks to some excellent directing by Phillip Noyce, ""Salt"" manages to keep viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.
The plot is straightforward - or so it seems. Evelyn Salt works for the CIA and is planning on celebrating her anniversary with her husband when a man claiming to be a Russian agent walks into the building claiming that he wants to defect. While being questioned, he makes an extraordinary claim: Salt, he says, is a Russian agent who plans to kill the Russian president.
Exactly why she would want to do that is a little unclear but it nonetheless puts her under suspicion. Fearing that her husband might be in danger, and not wishing to undergo intensive interrogation until she makes sure he is safe, Salt manages to escape and leads the CIA on a merry chase until she finally meets up with the man who trained her to be a double agent from an early age.
It's at this point that what seemed to be a straightforward plot starts to get a little more interesting. I won't reveal the twists and turns it takes in this review because that would be unfair to the men and women who made the film and to those who have not yet seen it. I will say that many critics have complained that the script is ""implausible"" and they may be right about that. However, ""Salt"" is an action/adventure movie and not a documentary and, because that's so, I think that criticism is unfair. The script moves the movie along at a rapid-fire pace, none of the lines the actors' voice are ridiculous, and, as a result, I just don't see it as being a badly written movie.
In addition to Jolie, the cast includes Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Both actors give outstanding performances. There is, in fact, no weak link in the cast. As mentioned earlier, Noyce's direction is skillful and the film flows smoothly from scene to scene. The costuming and make-up are both handled extremely well, giving Jolie multiple looks throughout the movie as she uses her ability as a spy to alter her appearance in order to avoid capture.
In summary: A nail-biting action movie with a wonderful performance by Jolie and some very good work on the part of supporting actors. If you like action movies, you'll enjoy this 5-star film.",1489881600,,3611,4.548387096774194
3832747,5,B0021L8V0W,"alternate extended ending is worth the price, and the extras are great.
SALT is just a great film with original story, good dialog and acting. The commentaries are selectable as subtitles.

3833396,5,B0021L8V0W,"Salt, is a kind of a mix between the Bond franchise, the FX show The Americans, and mixes in plot elements from lots of other spy/secret agent movie that has come down the pipe.  In some ways there is not a lot new here, but the twist of making the main character a woman, Evelyn Salt  played of course by Angelina Jolie, does add something that makes the movie stand out on its own.

There are actually three versions of the movie on the DVD, the PG-13 theatrical version, an unrated director's cut, which has a different take on a death scene that would have pushed it to an R rating, a twist on the ending of the movie, and a bit more character development, mainly between Salt and her husband.  There is also an unrated extended edition, which actually has a shorter running time than the director's cut, which mainly has a totally different ending from the other two films, plus the changed death scene.  All three versions of the film are good, and are honestly all worth watching.  As most know the movie is about a CIA agent, Salt, who is accused of being a Russian sleeper agent in the US, who will carry out an assassination within a couple days.  The movie then basically becomes part chase story, part is she, or isn't she a Russian Spy, that really does not get resolved fully until the end.  The main supporting roles go to Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor as fellow CIA agents trying to track her down and bring her in.  The movie clearly sets up a possible sequel or even franchise of films, that may or may not ever materialize.  But even as its own stand alone the movie is very good.

For those who get the disc, the movie(s) look and sound great on Blu-Ray.  There are a lot of behind the scenes and making of features, that end up running probably an hour and a half total.  There is also a commentary track on the theatrical version of the film mainly done by the director  Philip Noyce, and added to by some of the visual effects and sound contributors.  A lot of material that really ends up fleshing out the overall story for those who like to go through the extras, and provides a lot of interesting history about the real KGB illegals program of placing spies in America and other countries as well as some of the U.S. history of doing the same thing.

While I cannot say everyone will like this movie, if you are a fan of any of the principle actors and/or director, or just generally like the spy movie genre, this is definitely worth checking out.",1463788800,,2480,4.393873085339169
3833397,3,B0021L8V0W,"The plot development was lacking, and overall I was bored despite this being an action film. As for the ending...lackluster and unresolved. Would not watch ~_~ It tried to end on a mysterious note but just made me deadpan.

Utterly corny.

I gave it three stars because the action was filled with credible realism as for what a human is capable of instead of a computerized effect that looks fake, nice graphics, and that at least there was a plot (lacking though it was).

Jolie might pass for another role but with her weight and overall sickish look on this movie, she doesn't match the role or the character at all. She fails to convince you as a super spy.
There are many holes on the script itself and action scenes are not at all convincing. One of those would be the free jump down the elevator shaft and sliding down without any gear or protective gloves at the least. It is simple physics 1 on 1.
Overall disappointing. If they do make a sequel and she stars in it again, I am hoping for some obvious improvement and her gaining some weight and muscle power. Otherwise when she kicks down men twice her size and weight, unlike Maggie Q, who is also slender but well built and much more convincing, the combat scenes are plain fake.",1457481600,,909,4.352941176470588

I played it on the new Samsung 4k player and a Sony UHD television.  Picture is no better than the Blu-ray so save your money until true 4k movies are being released.  Not so with other 4k movies I have watched so far.  San Andreas and Mad Max are quite good in 4k  (actually 2k but who's counting).  Be sure you turn Brightness on your TV up all the way since the new 4k movies are a bit darker than Blu-rays.

Running from the law, Evelyn is unexpectedly an expert at escaping the people she has been working with and all of a sudden her actions aren't so friendly. It quickly becomes questionable: will she go through with her instructions to kill the Russian President, and how many people will she take down along the way? With only one goal in mind, Agent Salt begins to show her true colors as being a very dangerous woman. The plan is to destroy America and Salt is very capable of making that plan happen, but can she avoid the FBI, CIA and cops long enough to see her plans come true or is she just a piece of the plan thats being used? Can she outsmart her enemies or will someone step up to defeat her? How far and how many dead bodies will there have to be before Salt is stopped?

3834238,1,B0021L8V0W,"I have seen a lot of sh**ty films in my life - but few can match this one! I very litterally suffered viewing it and I HATE myself for having watched this... this... thingy until the last minute. Below, more of my impressions (but not much, because I just want to forget it), with very limited SPOILERS.

Evelyn Salt is a CIA operative, once active in operations abroad but nowadays mostly working in the office. She is very appreciated by her superior Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and happily married to a German enthomologist Mike Krause (August Diehl), who is well aware of the nature of her work. One day, Salt is given the task to debrief a Russian defector, Oleg Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) - then all hell breaks lose and the film really begins.

For me this thing died after less than 10 minutes, during the interview of Oleg Orlov, as the story becomes at that moment so immensely ludicrous that it cannot even be considered a comedy. From that moment on, things get just more and more nonsensical until the mind blowing absurdity of the ""great"" finale. In the first half I was wondering why this film removed the top of my skull and keeps taking a dump inside - in the second half I understood that it was a safety procedure, because it was the only thing that kept my brain from exploding... I honestly think I have NEVER seen such nonsense in my life!

The nonsensical plot could be forgiven if at least there was anything else in this film - but there isn't. This is basically 100 minutes of stunts and action scenes, each one more over the top than the previous one, which in principle should be impressive - but as the main hero is invulnerable, indestructible, unstoppable, fire-proof, bullet -proof, water-proof (yes, that too), faster than light, stronger than Hulk, knows everything, speaks all the languages, read minds, etc. etc. it gets quickly boring. It is made even worse by main hero opponents - they are all completely incompetent slow targets, never offering any credible threat, making stupid things, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, understanding nothing, unable to shoot, unable to fight, unable to drive, etc... Picture a ""shooting fishes in the barrel"" Chuck Norris movie, just without the tongue-in-cheek parodic undertone of those MIA films - and you will get the picture.

There is almost no dialogs in this film, just shooting, running, jumping and explosions. There is no humour or second degree - this MOUNTAIN OF NONSENSE actually tries to pretend to be a serious film... The ending is... well, here I have a problem. I run out of negative adjectives and out of capital characters and out of insults... So I will just stop here and will not even mention the ending, for fear of throwing up.

I hated every second of this film and I just praise the Lord that I rented it instead of buying. Stay away from this %*+!! as if it was a DEADLY PLAGUE.",1445299200,,2881,4.674556213017752

Its gritty, raw and delivers action as fast paced as the ""big Boys"" of action films. The film winds around in twists and turns that always keeps the viewer not knowing the truth. The action sequences are very exciting to watch as Mrs. Salt  maneuvers her way from one obstacle to the next in break-neck speed. The camera angles distort the viewers power of reason as to what is going to happen in the story. I rated it for 5 stars for action, suspense and intrigue.",1436054400,,587,4.485981308411215

There is a plot to kill the Russian president, OUR president, and last but not least, launch a nuclear war that would have provoked all of our enemies to retaliate. .....And Ann is the only one who knows who the moles are. She knows who the traitors are. And she should. BECAUSE, even though she is a faithful Amaerican now, she WAS at one time one of THEM! . Now the Goverment thinks that she's the mole.

What makes Angelina so captivating his her focus. She locks you in from the start to finish.

She would make a great opponent for James Bond. And you can bet that her part would not be bettered by Bond either! Somehow she would escape at the end.

3835188,4,B0021L8V0W,Angelina Jolie's Movie of her 2010 understanding of SALT in respects to SPY movie clips and or films was very truthful in the understandings of Russian Sleeper Spy in what I thought of it's thought about them.

As someone who speaks Russian fluently I really watch for the thickness of the accent when my language is being used in any movie. I must say, Angelina Jolie is really good with learning her lines in Russian in this movie. I was amazed that I could actually understand her clearly compared to some other actors who had lines in Russian but the accents being so thick that I couldn't understand if they were speaking English or in some other language.

The action scenes in this movie and the whole plot is really spot on. A very emotionally driven kind of movie as well. I almost wanted to throw something at my tv screen after the scene where Evelyn Salt watches her husband die. When I have those kind of reactions to a movie that is when I know that this movie is worth my money because the actors are doing their jobs.

With the plot squirming like a twisty-turny thing and relentless action there is never a dull moment and Jolie was an inspired bit of casting (...not too convinced with the blonde look though). Tom Cruise would have brought a monolithic macho feel to the film and made it too much of a Bourne look-alike; the plot is already sufficiently Bourne'esque.

3835672,5,B0021L8V0W,"First off... I am an Angelina Jolie fan, for her beauty, her activism, her talent, and her movies. That said, this movie did not get 5 stars for those qualities, as it would have only gotten 4 stars on those merits. The 5 stars are for this Blu-ray edition of a 4 star movie. I really enjoyed this movie when it came out, It did have, as described, a Bond / Bourne feel to it, and I really like the fact that they did it with a female lead. I was even more impressed that this edition contains 3 versions of the movie, each different enough to be distinct separate movies, not just some added scenes, that were left on the cutting room floor for time's sake. The extended director's cut was very different, leaving out one of my favorite major fight scenes, on the barge, in favor or more character depth and an alternate ending. I was very gratified to be surprised when I watched it, a risky but rewarding take. To the point of the 5th star, simply value. Enough time has passed that this Blu-Ray has dropped to the reasonable price of $7.99 but the fact that the production provided enough material for 3 version and you get them all, is a rare and great value, if just for the extra re-watch ability. I usually cringe at paying more than 9.99 for a movie, as I know the actually production cost of the disc and package, and realize that time is my friend, so I wait. This is a package that is well worth 14.99, I only wish the studios would make more like feature rich version like this, instead of the usual behind the scenes garbage and commentary they call bonus features. I wonder which version will be the basis for the sequel.",1417910400,6,1636,4.3322475570032575

Since this is my favorite movie I purchased it to own and needless to say I have watched this movie over and over again so many times.  No matter how many times I watch though it still keeps me in suspense and on the edge of my seat.  An added benefit for anyone ready to begin an exercise program, play a sport, run a marathon, or do anything else that is physically taxing is that this movie impedes any feelings of impending exhaustion. Reluctance to start swiftly move out of the way as Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) compels an invincible attitude coupled with a sense of urgency.

Is she a Russian spy?  Is she a mind-controlled spy?  Has she been set up?  As soon as the question comes up, the ride starts, and we are off for an entertaining film.

Few high-profile actors can do this . When I see a movie starring Jennifer Gardner, I feel I am watching Jennifer Gardner - the same with Leonardo, Julia and even Matthew Mc C -- no matter how much weight lost for his oscar performing role - I can still see the Tabloid touting, vain, annoying voice of a pot smoking hotshot  that loves himself --

This movie transports into an underground world that makes us question the real reality of government and takes us into a dark underworld ---

Five stars- I saw this movie twice in one year and that says a lot - definitely not a waste of time- nor does it ever drag (get your snacks before the movie starts playing - unless you can pause it - you don't want to miss a second of this film )

It's such a small gesture and if not paying attention, can be completely missed, but that scene pushed this story to 5 stars for me.

I loved that she fought so hard to save her husband!  I'm glad the movie I watched didn't show the husband being drowned, because I wouldn't have believed that she truly loved him while watching him die slowly!!

Everything was done right in this film but I would have loved to see the female operative protecting her husband.  Not many books or movies create a story where it's the female that's the protector.

Fabulous film though.  So worth watching!",1393545600,,792,4.528169014084507

Suffice to say, it is quite a well played action film, with complexities, heroics, dastardly evil ones, and general goings-on that make the movie seem just a  few minutes in length. Jolie is the Star in capital letters, with good support from the rest of the cast. The chase scenes stand high in the very tough competition in that area and the stuntmen (and woman) more than earn their pay. Yes, perhaps one's credulity might be strained a bit, but, never mind, its more fun if one simply believes and accepts. Watch it and see.",1384992000,3,665,4.450819672131147

3837407,5,B0021L8V0W,"I only saw the extended cut and re-watched with the voiceover filmmakers' commentary so I will not be reviewing the theatrical version.  The standard technology at the time of this viewing is in Blu-Ray and I won't waste your time with the description of the technology or presentation differences. The DVD I watched comes with the standard extras (more than most DVD's) and unless you do something the standard coming attractions.

Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is being pointed out as a mole (Russian sleeper agent) with a mission. This accusation automatically condemns her husband to death. So Evelyn must go rogue to save her husband and prove her innocence. Yes I know this story is been done before but never as well acted.

Will Evelyn be able to track down the culprits before she is dispatched by her own people? And it appears that she still has a good friend on the inside; at least someone willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and that is fellow agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber).

The film has plenty of action, lots of great background music, and veteran actors that do not overwhelm their character's personalities. You may be able to guess the plot, guess the twists, and guess the outcome as they did not go out of the way to mask these two well. But who cares it's a lot of fun watching the individual characters trying to figure this out for themselves.

Ah, well, Angelina better luck next time... I can actually think of one redeeming feature for this movie... iit should be a wonderful cure for insomnia.

1. The stunts and fight scenes are really sped up to attempt to make the star seem able to leap tall buildings when actually she is way past her action prime. The had to use doubles the majority of the time to make her seem athletic.

2. There's plenty of boredom here, and I felt the plot was not even close to being plausible. It was hard to stay interested. The freeway truck jumping scenes were hysterical. Salt's slow moving bode was able to leap far distances which made the scenes so laughable.

3. The acting is average, and the characters, especially Angelina Jolie, show a shallow depth. It could have ended much sooner and that would have helped over all.

It sounded as if the bass was turned all the way up and distorted. Each character sounded like they were talking with their hands over their mouth. Whenever I turned up the volume to make up for the muffled dialogue, an action sequence would start and would be so loud and bassy I thought it would blow out the speakers on my tv.

The movie itself has a good story.  The characters could be a little bit more developed for a spy movie but the plot is complicated enough to make it entertaining and watchable more than once.

I know it's kind of stupid and none on my business, but I just have no respect for her anymore (I was never a big fan of Pitt's anyway...so  no big loss there).  That said, I think the movie could have been somewhat better and believable.... there were parts in it, like when Jolie went down the elevator shaft... I don't believe she was wearing gloves... do you know what that would do to your bare hands?!!!!  Also, when she stabbed one of the characters... I believe she walked away with blood just on her hands???  Oh, yeah... her 'disguise' of fake teeth and colored contacts... yeah, I'd NEVER have recognized her..... :{  I didn't find Jolie believable in the part.  I think someone like Zoe Saldana or Eva Mendez would have been better as a 'tough guy.'  I just didn't buy it with stick figure Jolie.

The story follows an elite mechanic/hitman as he weaves through deception and retribution while mentoring the son (played excellently by Foster) of his former friend and boss (Sutherland). Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.

The picture quality was average at times, with a great deal of exteriors having that grainy look, but other times the clarity was above par.

Anyway, I was entertained from start to finish, and I didn't see most of the twists coming. Jolie's a great action star, and I think the best part of this movie is that it has a female action lead without making that the point. So many movies with female action leads seem to be -about- the fact that the lead is female, but that's not the case here- the lead is a badass, and she just happens to be female.

About the movie itself, you definitely want this edition, and you definitely want to watch the Director's cut (not Extended), as it includes a better ending and scenes that were changed for the theatrical release are much better there.

3838238,5,B0021L8V0W,"Salt (2010 Columbia) starring Angelina Jolie and directed by Philip Noyce is a duplication and update of a well done French classic movie make in 1990 titled La Femme Nikita (1990 France) starring Anne Parillaud and directed by Luc Beeson.

See the ""Alternatiave Ending"" version of this movie.....it's better, makes better sense, should have been chosen as the ""primary"" or ""main"" version of the movie released to movie houses. The Alternative version ending is very intelligent and satisfying in a way the ""official,"" ""main"" version of the movie is not. Nuff said!

Well....more about that....(to drive the point home!)......

The ""Alternative Ending"" version of ""Salt"" (2010) available on DVD's with several variations of the movie is the best one, and all interested in the great ""Salt"" movie should see that version, rather than the version which was released to the movie houses in 2010, and which is the ""default"" ""official,"" and ""main"" version viewers see unless they visit the ""special features"" section of the DVD of ""Salt"" and choose the ""alternative ending.""

To get back to the comparison of ""Salt"" (2010) with ""La Femme Nikita"" (1990), both movies are about beautiful females who look like high fashion ramp models, both unusually underweight with exotic faces and thick, sensuous lips, who are recruited, manipulated, forced to become government assassins, and who murder many innocent people in cold blood 'doing their job"" during the course of the story and the movie, but in the end ""jump ship"" and escape from their government manipulator puppet-masters, and disappear at the end of both movies to an unknown and uncertain future....the price both women pay for escaping from their roles as forced government assassins.

Both movies demonstrate and assert that the classical ""femme fa tale"" may be part of a story which has almost nothing to do with romance or connection with any male, and also that the female protagonist in an action/ mystery story (both Salt and La Femme Nikita are action/ mystery stories) can be capable of astonishing feats of physical prowess and strength against male antagonists in which the female wins physical fights and the males lose....repeatedly.

Both Angelina Jolie as ""Evelyn Salt"" in SALT and Anne Parillaud (one of the top fashion models in France before she became a movie star) as ""Nikita"" retire from the stories both star in ""undefeated"" in all serious contests they engage in....the men they come up against always lose, the female protagonists always win.

The female protagonists never face female antagonists in either movie, which is significant.

The Salt (2010) movie uses a lot of tricky editing and fast paced cutting to assist Angelina Jolie 'do her thing"" beating up men and doing Harrison Ford style action miracles which would easily kill most people....

The La Femme Nikita (1990) movie is smoother, and more believable for that reason, and probably the better of the two movies for that reason.....it is much less a ""video-game"" Dark Knight type movie, relies far less on gimmicks and technical/ digital tricks.....

Salt (2010) starring Angelina Jolie lacks the needed humorous and human intervals provided in La Femme Nikita (1990). The main female character in Salt (2010) is much less lovable and far more driven...she really does stay ""on task"" and is almost a machine as military ideal soldiers are supposed to be. Women may or may not be capable of all the superstar action and heroic stunts Angelina Jolie performs as the ""Evelyn Salt"" character, but such ladies are like the napkins neatly folded for wedding anniversaries Angelina Jolie (""Salt"") comments on at the start of the movie...""Not too sexy."" How true, how true.

But Salt is a good movie worth seeing....so, of course is/was La Femme Nikita (1990).

The DVD disc version for home viewing I bought included three different versions of the movie, including an ""extended cut"" which showed and alternative ending and at least one key part earlier in the movie changed to fit the alternative ending. I can see why the version ultimately released in movie houses and offered as the ""official version"" was chosen. The released version (the ""official"" one) is more logical, and the ending is closer to La Femme Nikita (1990 French).

Both Salt (2010) and La Femme Nikita (1990) examine the potential and unexpected physical and mental power of beautiful females built like super-models one sees on Vogue Magazine covers, and almost never in Hollywood (or French) action movies.

Both are good movies. We need more just like them....odd that it took 20 years for Salt (2010) to pick up where La Femme Nikita (1990) left off.

Her martial arts is smooth and believable - the outcome, like all actions movies requires suspension of disbelief. It doesn't matter if it is Matt Damon or Angelina Jolie dropping opponents left and right, or, Chow Yun Fat flying through the air - the viewer always has to buy in. Why is it that men can accept Ulma Thurman and Michelle Yeon performing both gravity and strength defying stunts, but have so much difficulty accepting Jolie outside her role as Lara Croft. I found that the movie held my attention through out. However, the movie does have holes, and, I think the ending in the Extended Version is far better than the Cinema Release or the Director's Cut.",1350259200,,929,4.602409638554217

CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused of being a Russian spy by a Russian spy named Orlov.  Salt denies being a Russian spy, but her counter intelligence colleagues are divided about whether or not this is true.  She makes a break for it, escaping from her colleagues.  The movie follows Salt as she uncovers the truth behind Orlov's accusation, all while dodging pursuit from numerous, heavily armed U. S. agents.  The action is intense, and plentiful.  I think all aspects of Jolie's portrayal of Salt are believable, and well done.  The film does fail in some points.

Part of the plot near the end of the theatrical release is sketchy.  A witness is left alive, one whose testimony would be fatal to their attacker.  This is addressed in the director's cut.  U. S. agents shooting at Salt in situations crowded with civilians, and in traffic, stretches credibility for me.  Next, there are too many happy (for Salt) coincidences during Salt's escape from the U. S. agents.  Four different vehicles -- perfect for her needs -- just happen by, at just the right time, for Salt to use.  The result is an incredible action sequence that's tainted by too many unbelievable coincidences.  Salt so effectively evades those searching for her, I don't think she could have done a better job of avoiding detection if she wore a cloak of invisibility.

The biggest problem I have with the film is that Salt seems to have suprahuman healing abilities.  She takes on some physical damage that would result in a mere mortal having an extended hospital stay, if they even survived.  Yet, Salt walks away from such events, usually with only a bit of a limp, a grimace, and a sideways glance.  At times, Salt comes across like the X-Men's Wolverine, due to her amazing recuperative powers.

The story does a nice job handling the truth about whether or not Salt is a Russian spy.  Jolie is the standout, as her portrayal shows Salt as being complex.  From being vulnerable and gentle towards those Salt cares about, to being chillingly efficient when attacking an adversary.

Overall, I think the movie is a worth viewing.",1349654400,,2132,4.780821917808219

Who's who? Who can you trust?

As someone in the psychology field, the opening scenes, which feature an interview/interrogation, don't come close to realistic portrayals of lie detection. There is neural imaging without any cognitive device attached to the head. There is voice analysis for lie detection, but no measurement of galvanic skin response.

When Salt runs, the entire CIA goes after her. She has shown no lethal force and they begin firing at her.

Heck, I'd take Liam Neeson in Taken with all of his technique and sheer heart - natural talent over this tale which I hate to say really doesn't seem real. There's no character development for starters, you are talking about one dimensional characters - we're not even beginning to touch on the 'torture' scene which is laughable at best. Oh and exchange of Salt to the US? Come on now, what foreign country is going to trade up someone whom they think is a spy?? I don't care if another country offered the US the Lindberg baby or Jimmy Hoffa - we would NEVER and I mean NEVER EVER give up a spy for either of those two. If you want great stories and action in intelligence: stick with Ryan from Patriot Games and Jason Bourne, this is a waste of time. The open-ended closing sequence is a joke which is hardly a cliffhanger.",1339286400,,1282,4.530172413793103
3838311,3,B0021L8V0W,"There are three helpful customer descriptions of this film's versions - Theatrical, Extended, and Director's Cuts. They run 1:39:56, 1:40:58, and 1:43:59 etc.  But Amazon sells deluxe, unrated and limited versions, some blu-ray some not sure. Confused, I had to go elsewhere for clarification.  Here's what wicki has to say, just to clarify.  I wish the marketers would use the producer's terms or the product listing was up front about the versions.

Versions

Director Phillip Noyce has said that due to the extensive usage of flashbacks, ""there was always going to be a mountain of alternative material that would not fit into the theatrical version.""[32] The film ended up having two extra versions, the Director's Cut and the Extended Cut - which Noyce refers to in his audio commentary as the film's original cut - both included on the DVD and Blu-ray deluxe editions.[33]

The Director's Cut was described by Noyce as ""my own personal take on the material, free from the politics and restrictions of producers, studio or censorship ratings.""[32] Four minutes of film are added, leading to a running time of 104 minutes.[33] More flashbacks are added, and the violence is amped up - for example Mike being drowned rather than shot to death.[34] The ending is also different: in the bunker scene, Winter shoots the President instead of only knocking him unconscious,[10][32] and a media report during the final scene reports that the new US President had been orphaned on a family visit to Russia, implying he is also a sleeper agent.[35] Noyce has described this ending as ""an ending yet just a beginning -- and it's an ending that turns the whole story on its head"".[34]

The Extended Cut increases the running time by only one minute, but rewrites the plot by removing, rearranging and adding scenes.[33] The ending has Salt escaping custody from the CIA and going to Russia, where she kills Orlov - his death scene at the barge does not appear in this cut - and destroys the facility where new child spies are being trained.[35]",1339286400,2,2037,4.921282798833819

3838313,4,B0021L8V0W,The movie is the usual action thriller but what makes this movie stand out is the original part of SALT was for a male actor.  There was a great transition to making the part for a female.  I think the biggest difference of this movie is the alternate ending which involves watching the Alternative movie that has a different ending. It's not just a pasted alternative ending.  It's an ending that changes scenes and parts of the movie that results in the ending.  I personally like the Alternative movie.,1337731200,,505,4.640449438202247

3838359,4,B0021L8V0W,"Who would have ever though 12 years ago that perhaps the best action stars of their generation would be Matt Damon and Angelina Jolle?  Salt essentially is a ""Bourne"" movie with a female lead.  Evelyn Salt can kick ass as well as anyone and that is pretty much what she does.  The film doesn't promise to be a thinking man's (or woman's) story and has no pretenses.  It is, however a really well done action movie with a star that proves that her stunt work is as good as her acting and her looks.  Packaged up with some standout support from Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor this is how action movies should be made.  Granted, the plot is pretty ridiculous and I was able to figure out the ultimate twist early on.  Still I liked it very much.

3838362,3,B0021L8V0W,"Salt, the movie wanted to be part 007 and part Bourne. It succeeded in neither. At least, James Bond franchise knows not to take itself seriously. And in Bourne movies we care about the protagonist. With Salt we have James Bond extravaganza which we suppose to care about but we don't. Angelina Jolie is a wonderful action actress but she was never capable of expressing an emotion on screen to save her life and the character is not developed for us to at least pretend to care. The husband!? Care even less.
OK, so now that we are through the movie impression, the action on the screen is top notch, though suspended from reality in the best traditions of Die Hard franchise. The disc comes with three different versions of the movie, providing very alternative takes on some of the twists and how the story concludes. I, personally preferred the Unrated Extended cut. It allows us to guess on who's side Salt really is till the very late part of the movie, keeping the suspense going. It also has very different ending from both Theatrical and Director's cuts, which concludes the movie better, IMO.
Video and audio quality are both top notch - referential material for how the movie should be presented on Blu-Ray. The bonus materials are just that - bonus, as they do not carry any eye-opening information about movie or the espionage business.

Overall, this is an OK movie that definitely needs to be watched for any action junkie. Rent the Blu-Ray to see alternative cuts and give an exercise to your home theater. Return it next day and go on with your life.",1328745600,,1567,4.657039711191335
3838363,3,B0021L8V0W,"Salt is a very gritty and violent action thriller from 2010, and while it has a sparing amount of crude language, be prepared for a heavy dose of death.  We've seen the likes of this before, and usually there's some redemptive qualities that help make the level of violence more palatable.  In this case the female protagonist Evelyn Salt proves to be a cold blooded emotionless killer, and we see quite a trail of bodies in her wake.  The plot is quite suspenseful, because we're never entirely sure what side she and her surrounding cast are on.  The notion of sleeper agents is particularly interesting, but there are a few big holes in the story (e.g. why does Olsov go to CIA headquarters to blow Salt's cover?  Why doesn't she seem to know what he is talking about, but then cooperate fully with his plan?).  By the end you're left thinking that it was an okay ride, but not one you'd ever want to take a second time, or maybe even a first time. - GODLY GADFLY",1327276800,,966,4.429378531073446

As others have mentioned, it was obvious she really loved her husband Michael.  The scenes of Salt constantly on the run and then escaping capture were top notch.

The action sequences are well-shot and often thrilling, but Anglelina Jolie, as Evelyn Salt, is very much a comic-book hero. She jumps onto a moving truck, shoots her way out of impossible situations, falls out of a helicopter into freezing water, etc., always surviving with a few scratches (and looking gorgeous while she does it).  And of course, she never has to eat or sleep.  The Russians are stereotyped baddies trying to start WW III (how retro!).  There's tons of collateral damage, and of course it doesn't matter if many minor characters are maimed and killed as Salt rampages.

3838430,4,B0021L8V0W,"I hope that a decision is made to make a Salt II film continuing the superb suspense and action contained in this movie; it is that good. Angelina Jolie, known as Evelyn Salt in the film, is freed from a North Korean prison after being continually tortured in the prison while the North Korean soldiers try unsuccesfully to get her to admit that she is an American spy. When she is released, we are told that she has been working as a top agent for the CIA. We are also told that had a certain man not caused a lot of publicity about her capture, the CIA would not have tried to get her released. She hears this from her CIA boss.

Two years later, when she is married to the man who helped get her released, a top Russian agent comes to the CIA claiming that he wants to defect. He reveals that Russians want to kill the Russian president while he is visiting the US and participating in the funeral service for the American Vice President. He says that Salt is the Russian agent assigned to do the murder. Government agents try to arrest her, but she escapes. We begin to see that she has many skills. She tries to locate her husband who does not answer any of her calls. We see a long and exciting chase by government agents after Salt.

The film raises the questions: What happened to Salt's husband? Is the defector telling the truth? If yes, how did she become a Russian agent? If not, what is going on? Will the Russian president be shot and, if so, by whom? Why did the defector identify her as the murderer?",1324771200,,1516,4.2972027972027975

One minor complaint (***possible spoiler ahead***) was that I didn't understand why Salt was able to go on a flight as if nothing happened with the Russian guy even after killing a boatfull of Russians.

3838432,2,B0021L8V0W,"Political thrillers aren't supposed to be boring.  Certainly, this applies to just about every genre in the industry (save for anything golf-related), but poli-thrillers have the benefit of being centered around an aspect of life that simply gets audiences riled up by defailt:  That is, the innards of modern day politics.  It's an active panic trigger of a concept that comes with no manual, simply because most directors and screenwriters know precisely what to do with it.

I don't really know where Phillip Noyce went wrong with Salt.  It could've been enticing enough to encourage me to keep guessing HOW it would end, as opposed to WHEN.  Unfortunately, there's something inherently wrong with this movie's methods of scheming us into believing that anything of importance is up its sleeves, when there simply isn't.

Salt's depth lies in Jolie, who flourished as an actress years ago and no one seems to have caught on quite yet.  Benefiting from her committed performance, it's easy to stare into the movie's murky premise and see something substantial, only to soon realize they were simple mirages that the writers likely acknowledged, but failed to incorporate into the story, as the film progresses onwards without them.

Salt denies any real association with the complexities of espionage and massive political struggles, instead choosing to be kinetic and action-oriented, at the expense of being predictable.  It's a common trade-off, attempting to compensate for banality with the talent of their choreographers and intricate wire work, and it usually works.

Trouble is, Salt's uninspired nature is a disease that seems to have seeped into every aspect of the film, and Angelina isn't dynamic enough to save everything.  Chase scenes revolve around jumping aimlessly from one vehicle to another in identical fashion, and the fight sequences are tame and brief.

Everything about Salt seems to be determined to deny itself release from mediocrity; truth be told, there is potential here.  What could have been a half-decent Bourne clone is instead limited in scope, bland in visual richness, and dependent upon the charisma of Jolie, who cannot seem to encourage her supporting cast to follow in her wake, and it's not like Jolie is alone in the dark with amateur performers, either.  Again, however, Salt emits an air of humility and embarrassing lack of faith in itself and its underlying themes, and it just makes the whole movie feel sickly.",1324166400,3,2462,5.150753768844221

3838467,4,B0021L8V0W,"The true test of an action film is if the viewer can stop thinking and just believe it while watching.  This film definitely did that for me:  it is fast, scary, and for the most part just realistic enough.  A few scenes are over the top, but not many.  Spy action films can also be very fun in that they keep you guessing as to what is really going on, with clues, sudden choices, and shocking revelations.  This filkeeps you guessing more or less to the very end, changing the viewer's mind not once, but twice or even three times in what may be a record.  Good guys become bad guys and vice versa, but multiple times!  Even some (admittedly crude) politics come into it.  Of course, there is also a question of style, that is, how cool the characters are, how sexy.  Here again, Jolie proves herself a gifted, charismatic screen presence, one of the greatest woman character actors at the moment as well as a star.  She is sleek, strong, and sinuous, exuding both sensuality and hard concentration.  These elements work in this film eminently well.

However, at the deeper level, that of emotional identification with the character, the film is weaker.  Sure, Salt has connections with her past and present that make themselves felt, but I did not empathize much with her mission and plight.  To be sure, that isn't required in an action film, but it is in the very best of the genre.  The supreme masterpiece that does this is the Bourne Trilogy, which reached a new level of realistic action with an emotional overlay.  Bourne sets a new standard that the new James Bond series accomplishes with some success for an old character, but Salt doesn't quite reach it - yet.

Recommended.  I hope it becomes a series, because its potential is high and with a better script, we can expect much more.",1320710400,,1798,4.58307210031348

Review Of SALT-Theatrical Cut

The theatrical version of SALT is very good. Engaging from beginning to end. Angelina Jolie is as good here as she was in the TOMB RAIDER movies, which is very impressive. There's plenty of suspense and twists & turns. The ending will shock you. Sort of like a female version of MINORITY REPORT, starring Tom Cruise, who was originally attatched to star, but he withdrew saying that his the character was too much like Ethan Hunt from the MISSION: Impossible movies, and he was right. But Ms. Jolie manages to make the character her very own. Well-written script. Had I written it, though, I would have deleted the misuse of God's name (ie. God followed by a mild profanity), as I feel it is blasphemous. Plenty of action and suspense. I recommend it. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG. A sequel looks like F-U-N.

Review Of SALT- Director's Cut

The Director's Cut of SALT is a bit longer than the theatrical cut, with some additional flashback sequences cut from the Theatrical Version, some more violence, and an entirely different end for the President and Michael. Good fun, though I think that the added voiceover at the end implying Salt's death could just be a cover for a possible sequel. I prefer the open ending of the theatrical version. But see which version you like better. Unfortunately, the profaning of God's name is still present.

Both versions of the film are rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.",1320710400,2,1570,4.7536764705882355
3838469,3,B0021L8V0W,"When you watch this movie, it is important to keep in mind that it is first and most an action flick with a spy motive. And as such it has its own share of sometimes over-the-top action sequences. It was also written for Tom Cruise, but instead, Angelina Jolie took the lead. So, when a woman takes out multitudes of heavily armed men with a couple of kicks, it was meant to be a guy (not that it would make it any more believable). Considering all of the above, it is a pretty solid movie with good acting and an interesting plot with a couple of twists keeping you guessing almost to the end. It is nowhere near the action of Bourne or spy classiness of Bond, but it does the job. And, yes, in every action sequence all you see is the intent and the landing, never an actual jump, kick, drop, etc.

But that did not bother me as much as did many execution/plot errors, that could have been so easily avoided or edited...

(! Spoiler Alert !)

1. Would not blond braided hair give away Salt as a Russian spy from the very beginning?
2. How many American families lived in reclusive Soviet Union of the 70s? How many of them were involved in accidents where both parents died and only a child survived? After the first two or three someone should have raised concerns in the States, no?
3. Can product placement be any more obvious? If so, can you zoom in any closer on the Bolt Bus and Pepsi billboards?
4. Where is Russian president's security detail, when he is being assassinated?
5. Are regular city cops better equipped to transport an international double agent who just single-handedly assassinated a foreign country's leader than Secret Service or CIA?
6. What's the deal with ""going home"" prior to suicide mission? Do Russian spies really say that?
7. Ok, I am not a ballistics expert nor an engineer, but when you fire a couple of clips from an automatic weapon into a bullet-proof glass from no more than a couple of feet away, should you see at least some ricochet bullets? Better yet, is the bullet-proof glass really stronger than concrete bunker walls? Why don't they build bunkers out of glass then?
8. Winter, Salt, Peabody - do CIA agents ever have real sounding names like Mr. and Mrs. Smith (oh wait, wrong movie)?
9. Isn't Chenkov a male name? Does it not make Salt not only a double agent but also a guy? That would be an even better twist!
10. Can segue into Salt 2 at the end be any more obvious?

3838473,3,B0021L8V0W,"I would like to talk to you about a little movie called Salt. Oh where do I begin? Let me first start with the title. I think this title is stupid. You think the title is stupid. I realize that there are people in this crazy world whose surname is synonymous with a vital chemical compound, just like there are people named ""Jane Water"" or ""Peter Vitamin C."" However, a good movie title it does not make. Is it supposed to be some kind of play-on-words that I'm missing? Like ""salt"" of the earth (which would make no sense) or ""salt"" in the wound (which makes slightly more sense maybe)?

Anyway, Salt stars Angelina Jolie, she of the strange facial amalgamation of angular and puffy, as CIA operative Evelyn Salt (ugh) who is accused of being a Russian sleeper agent. That is pretty much the whole plot of the movie, sorry for not giving you a SPOILER ALERT. The rest of the film basically revolves around the question of ""Is she or isn't she?"" set into the framework of chase sequences and obligatory, balletic beat downs/gun battles that you expect from a summer action vehicle. In that aspect, Salt doesn't disappoint. The action sequences are thrilling, if not totally original. They do manage to strain at the limits of believability without crossing them, which is really the goal of any action movie of this type.

That being said, Salt does have a couple of major flaws that, when combined, prove too much. The first problem is Ms. Jolie herself. Now, calm down, let me explain myself. Angelina is a badass. I totally buy into her killing black op mercenaries with her bare hands. She exudes such power, confidence and badassery that she should have been in The Expendables instead of Randy Couture. But because of that, I've always had a problem with her when she has to play vulnerable. A critical aspect of the film is Salt's love for her husband and her need to protect him. It drives the action and is pretty much the entire basis for the movie. So it's unfortunate that Jolie and August Diehl have all the onscreen chemistry of a cardboard cut-out and an inanimate carbon rod. Since Diehl's total screen time is about 10 minutes, I'm afraid most of the blame has to go on Jolie. Even when she is talking about him or begging her now-suspicious CIA cohorts to help him, it seems like so many crocodile tears. It appears that, much like Chuck Norris, Angelina Jolie only seems to have two settings: Wait and Kill.

The second problem I had with the film is the bloat it develops as the story progresses. I was into this film for the first third of it, right up to what turns out to be the FIRST twist. This first twist comes early enough that you are like ""Cool! Now that that is out of the way, let's see how the rest of this plays out."" And it is exciting up to and after the first twist! I was all, ""Yay Salt!"" But then twist number two comes up and I'm all ""Ummmm...ok...well, I guess that kind of makes sense. On with the plot!"" Then the third twist comes (really?), then a fourth (Oh come on!). By the last set of twists and reveals, you've figured this whole thing out way in advance and you're just not interested anymore. To top it all off, they've worked so hard to make it complicated that the ending seems lazily thrown in there. It's an ambitious bit of storytelling but in the end, it's a mess and is ultimately unsatisfying.",1315353600,2,3352,4.473856209150327
3838474,4,B0021L8V0W,"If you don't think too much this is a good spy action movie. There's not much character development. There are gaping holes in the plot. And many of the stunts are totally unbelievable. This is definitely not a classic film, but if you are in the mood for a middlebrow action thriller then Salt is a highly entertaining and energetic choice.",1314576000,,341,4.60655737704918
3838494,2,B0021L8V0W,"Angelina Jolie plays the lead character in ""Salt"" ss a steroidal-driven CIA agent that mimics a Russian double agent intent on starting World War III. It takes a while to figure this out and you get to see Angelina go through scores of physical gyrations and stunts unlike anything her other cartoon character, Laura Kroft, ever achieved. For instance, at various times in this chase-filled film, Jolie:

-- Scales skinny window sills of a high rise D.C. apartment building with her dog in the backpack -- in her bare feet.
-- Escapes capture by jumping from a freeway overpass onto a semi truck moving at freeway speed.
-- Jumps from that semi to a similarly haulin' gasoline tanker with a skinny grated deck.
-- Jumps to another vehicle moving at highway speed and hangs onto the edge by one hand before righting herself.

All this without a scratch or without mussing her makeup or hair. Later on:

-- She takes on at least 50 CIA agents in several combat scenes, without nary a scratch.
-- In purusit of the U.S. president, she repeatedly jumps downward in an elevator shaft, 3-4 floors at a time, always landing perfectly on little triangular steel ledges.
-- She survives and walks away from a car crash when the vehicle goes off the edge of a freeway, plummets 20-30 feet, and lands atop a bunch of other vehicles.

She walks away from all this without a scratch. Oh yes, one time she cut herself. Later on, she destroys the funeral of the vice-president to the chagrin of 500 security agents and, to top that, saves the world from nuclear annihilation. If none of this is enough for you, in the final scene she takes a dive from a moving helicopter into a freezing ocean without a parachute or even her shirt, makes it to shore, then runs off into a fade to black screen, apparently setting the scene for ""Salt II: The Return of Wonder Woman.""

To say this film defeats the concept of suspended disbelief is like saying the Hindenburg had a little accident. Whatever the merits of the film's story, acting, scenery and script, nothing can overcome its excessive, ridiculous and utterly laughable action sequences. No one can possibly believe, for one moment, that anything in this very high budget film could ever really have taken place.",1313452800,15,2246,4.690355329949239
3838495,1,B0021L8V0W,This past Saturday I decided to take advantage of my local theaters air conditioning and perused the paper to see if there were any movies worth seeing. I chose the Angelina Jolie movie Salt. Simply put. I don't see what all the rave reviews for this movie were brought on by. Any fan of the old Mission:Impossible tv series with Peter Graves could see the twists and turns coming miles away but there is a much more annoying aspect to this movies toilet paper thin plot. The major scene that takes place several feet under the White House is a direct ripoff of the same sequence in the much better acted live action G.I. Joe movie that was out in theaters last year. So I strongly suggest you rent that movie instead and take this Jolie action adventure with a grain of salt.,1313020800,6,776,4.433566433566433
3838496,4,B0021L8V0W,"Don't expect a masterpiece. It is not. But it is a good action film and you can enjoy it a lot provided you accept the clichs that come with the genre.

Of course the first agent shown as the victim of the monstrous communist North Koreans has to be the good one, even if it is a double or triple agent. In the same way the first American agent shown as snow white and crystal clear has to be a traitor and a double agent.

So what is the difference of this film as compared to Bourne, Stallone and Terminator?

The first element is that there are so many levels of secret agents that ignore one another that the Russians will inevitably lose. They have yet an easy task infiltrating the USA to the top, except the President of course; But this system at one moment has to fail, especially when they start taking hostage the people who are close to their agents and then killing these hostages in cold blood when the effect has been reached, or they think it has. Then the double secret agent has nothing left to lose.

Infiltrating the USA is as easy as easy can be because they are a technological sewage or wasteland as for security and screening people and events. Even the procedure to start a nuclear war is so flimsy with confrontation of simple digital signals or alphanumerical codes via machines and nothing else is of course a farce.

But good is always the victor in these films. The most positive element is that the main character is a woman, which will satisfy the transfer desires of girls and women in the audience to be able to identify with that demoniac agent impersonated by Angelina Jolie. That's a good change in the genre.

When these children become adults, how would they remain loyal to the Russian spy master after all these years without seeing him? Toward the ending Salt empties two out of four magazines from an automatic rifle against the wall trying to open the door to the nuclear missile launch chamber. Why doesn't she carries the same rifle with the remaining two magazines and enters the chamber to kill Ted Winter? Instead she carries a pistol with single clip and has a shootout with Ted Winter in the chamber. Obviously the director wants a fist fight between these two characters when both runs out of pistol bullets.  Another illogical plot is how Ted Winter thinks he will get away from trying to launch the missiles. Even the only witness, the US President, is knocked into coma and will never wake up to testify against him.

The Film 4/5

Salt is full of action and includes an air of mystery. The opening scene takes us back two years and we see Evelyn Salt (Jolie) interrogated in North Korea. She's in pretty bad shape after being beaten, but refuses to talk, even when a tube is forced down her throat and gasoline is poured in. She's eventually released as part of a prisoner exchange and returns to work as a CIA agent. This all happens at the start of the movie and sets up what is to come.

The final thing I'm going to reveal is an encounter with a Russian defector. She's selected to interview him and discovers that there's a plan underway to substitute certain Americans with Russians. They become sleepers who will eventually act on behalf of Russia. He informs any agents who might be listening that Evelyn Salt is the name of one such agent.

Salt has a decision to make. Which of her colleagues can she trust? Should she stay and answer the accusations? Would it be better to run and try to prevent other sleeper agents from fulfilling their purpose? She decides to run and most of her colleagues see it as an admission of guilt. We're placed in her position and it's one with no obvious solutions. It has the same feel as the Bourne movies, with confusion surrounding her identity.

The CIA isn't happy that she evaded capture and sends agents to bring her back. This results in a huge chase scene in which Salt makes some unlikely decisions. If you're a fan of action movies, this is where the story really takes off. The first chase scene happens on a highway and sees Salt making improbable leaps between moving vehicles to evade capture.

Jolie looks capable of making some of the jumps, and we see her continually revise her plan as she flees her pursuers. The story keeps us guessing about the level of her involvement and we can't be sure what her motivations are. She's resourceful and uses her intelligence in order to predict the moves of her pursuers and discover the motivations of the Russian group.

If you enjoy movies such as Taken, Wanted, Bourne or Die Hard, this is your kind of story. The first adrenalin rush comes early and we rarely have time to breathe. There is a plot, although it's secondary to the action. This is a movie that entertains because of its pacing and spectacular chase scenes. There's not a great deal of thought required, but you will see that everything makes some kind of sense if you think about what you have just seen. Well, it makes as much sense as the average James Bond movie.

If you want to see Jolie running around, climbing, jumping and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, grab your popcorn and enjoy the ride. The loose ends are tied up neatly and the conclusion is satisfying. The acting is convincing, although Jolie never has to show the range of emotion that she achieved in Changeling. Schreiber and Ejiofor are always good and both play their roles well.

Video Quality 5/5
It's hard to fault the look of the movie. Colors appear natural and detail is strong. There's a fine layer of grain and the picture has considerable pop. I felt like I was in the middle of the action. Sony has delivered another great transfer.

Audio Quality 5/5
There's a lot happening on the screen and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track handles everything that's thrown at it. Chase scenes sound incredible, while scenes involving explosions and gunfire have the appropriate impact. Dialogue doesn't suffer either, and the surrounds are active throughout the duration of the movie. The score adds to the action scenes and completes the experience. You won't have any complaints about the presentation.

Previews

BD-Live

Salt is a well-crafted spy movie that's heavy on the action, although there are a couple of twists in there too. Jolie looks the part and is convincing in her role and the supporting cast does a great job. If you want to be thrilled for 100 minutes without having to think too much, this will get the job done. The Blu-ray presentation is excellent and the special features contain a wealth of additional information if you're curious.

3838503,3,B0021L8V0W,"There are two ways to look at this movie;

1) Taken as a serious film, it's ridiculously
  stupid. I mean this movie is aimed at the
  lowest common denominator. It' so
  unbelievable that it's practially a live
  action cartoon. Other than the Jolie
  character, the other characters are idiotic,
  especially the Liev Schrieber one.

2) Viewed as a ""guilty pleasure"", this is a fun
  piece of mondo trash. Angelina Jolie is
  super sexy, makes as good as a heroine as
  any, the action sequences are thrilling and
  the plot turns are akin to pro wrestling.

I do not condone the use of controlled substances but this is essentially ""pot""/drunkard  entertainment. It's the type of movie where , if you just catch snippets, it's good enough. This is not a movie that you need to view from start to finish.

If there would have been some choice nudity, then it really would have upped the trash-o-meter a la ""Showgirls""",1308960000,4,919,4.6645569620253164
3838514,5,B0021L8V0W,"Move over Bruce.  Angelina is your female counterpart.  This is a good action movie.  Jolie, who is known to do a lot of her own stunts does a great job.  This blu ray version is a nice touch with its extended and director's cuts.  Without going into a detailed synopsis of the plot, suffice it to say that this is an action flick similar in some respects to Willis' ""The Jackal.""  Whereas Willis played an international hit man for hire,  Jolie plays a Russian mole implanted into the CIA.  Both roles contain the usual wild and unbelievable action sequences.  But what the heck, this is an action flick, and most action flicks are not meant to mirror reality.  They are what they are, entertainment.  I found this movie to be just that, and recommend it to all of those that like to watch pure action entertainment.",1308700800,4,817,4.527397260273973

3838518,4,B0021L8V0W,"The fact that it's predictable doesn't necessarily mean it's bad or boring, just sort of lacking in surprises. Angelina Jolie plays the part of Evelyn Salt, a very remarkable super spy who's superior training enables her to either beat up or just outsmart every other spy most specifically including guys half again her size.

If you're OK with that then you may be in for a rather fun action adventure featuring this remarkable woman. The theatrical version starts with a bang and the pace keeps going at a rapid clip for the rest of the movie. The movie appears to end with a sequel in mind; a sequel is under consideration by Sony but the jury is still out on Jolie's participation as I understand it.

On balance the movie is entertaining but not great; if you're a fan of Jolie's you may want to add this one to your collection. If not, then watch it first to make a determination of whether or not you should own it. If you are a Jolie fan then the preferred version may be the Blu-ray Delux Unrated Edition.",1307836800,,1014,4.446236559139785

As in ""Lara Croft"" movie this heroine is smart, determined, beautiful and she can fight, pull some serious stunts by riding on the top of the truck, or riding a motorcycle bike. Oh, and this time around, the heroine speaks Russian!

This is an action packed movie that will keep you on your toes from start to finish.  However, I found some of the scenes difficult to watch, especially the ones where Jolie's heroine gets punched around by beefy male advesaries.  Good entertainment movie that leaves ending open to ""Salt 2"" sequel....",1307491200,,742,4.7578125

Surround her with explosions and she shines!

`Salt' is an interesting film.  On the outset it seems like a generic action adventure film with little merit outside of Jolie's commanding presence.  Instead, what one finds is a remarkably well rounded film that understands the importance of building a story instead of staging a series of random action sequences.  The story presented in `Salt' is an engaging and thought provoking one, and while it is obviously handled in a way that puts the emphasis on the explosions, it doesn't forsake `brains' in the process.

`Salt' tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt.  Apparently she's a Russian spy.  This is news to her and soon she is on the run from her former friends and colleagues who want to detain her.  She seems to be mainly concerned for her husband's wellbeing, and of course clearing her name.

Twists, turns and a lot of `booms' ensue.

The action is top notch here, wonderfully paced to implode in the eardrums and eye sockets of the movie-watching public; and it works great.  Angelina kicks serious booty, and the slick editing makes for a thrilling ride.  I will call caution to the film's constant violent nature.  To be honest, there are many sequences that feel almost too graphic for the film's rating.  I'm shocked that it didn't receive an R rating (that stairway execution scene in particular was very rough).  So, be mindful of the kiddies.  The acting is all what you'd expect from a film in this genre.  I want to say that I really love Liev Schreiber and really wish he'd get better roles.  He has such acting talent (I still cry when I think of his performance in `A Walk on the Moon') but he never gets to really use it.  It appears that he has Peter Sarsgaard syndrome (great actor reduced to stereotypical villain roles).

HOLLYWOOD, GIVE THESE MEN BETTER ROLES!!!

Alas, there is no real reason to gripe about that here, since the film is elevated with his presence, and I'm happy about that.  In the end I totally recommend this.  It's loud, abrasive and IN-YOUR-FACE, but it has depth of story that is not often found within this genre.

Whether it be Wanted, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Tombraider, or now this 2010 release, her live-action movies seem to blend into each other.  In this one, she is an American, raised as a Russian spy, who joins the CIA, pretends to carry out her mission for Russia, while intending to save America.  Sounds complicated?  Well, the action scenes help to explain everything, and it does it at under 2 hours in length.  For fans of Jolie's physique, you will be disappointed as she shows no skin; in fact she is often wearing various disguises.  For fans of Bond movies, the Bourne trilogy, and the Mission Impossible films, this is right up your alley.

The chase scenes (and there are LOTS!!) fail to suspend even the smallest reasoning. Why did Jolie run WITH the traffic in the first chase scene when she's jumping off freeway off-ramps hundreds of feet high to tiny trucks below? The big Gov. SUV chasing them could never have negotiated a U-turn to go after her, but NO, she keeps running straight and predictable.

Another scene, when she impossibly gets out of the cop's patrol car she steals a fashionable black and white striped (racoon?) fur hat and ends up on a boat out of the harbor and the hat has magically paired itself with a matching fashionable pancho thing with the same fur lining!!

I'm sure there's more moronic goings on in this dud, but I can't bring myself to watch it all. Did see the lame ending that SCREAMS sequel! Might have been good if there'd been some story.

3838561,2,B0021L8V0W,"I didn't see this movie in the theater because I'd rather watch certain types of action films on the 32-inch screen rather than the big screen. I must say, however, that the film left me with kind of a bad taste in my mouth. I have nothing against women being depicted as powerful action heroines. We've certainly seen much of that in recent years, with Uma Thurman in the two Kill Bill films and Sigourney Weaver in Alien and Aliens. So I was left with a puzzle. Why did I find Evenlyn Salt so unappealing? Why did the movie leave me feeling unsatisfied and unsympathetic, ultimately, with the female protagonist?

Even though I am a feminist and a woman who has always worked with very strong women in fields such as publishing and university teaching, Salt lost my sympathy when she stood there and watched her beloved husband die. Here's a woman who can very convincingly take out the CIA and the Secret Service, but she can't save the man who saved her life in North Korea and has given her nothing but love and tenderness? And if she broke out of her cell at the beginning of the film to find him, why did she let him die once she had?

Dare I say it? I realize that I expect more of a female action lead than to be just a man in a female body. What's interesting about that? Beatrice in Kill Bill 2 fights to save her child because she is a mother. Ripley in Aliens fights to save Newt and her friends. Both of these women are ""Big Mamas,"" protectors and warriors we can count on. I think we've come to expect more of women action stars. What sets them apart from the the Van Dammes and the Schwarzeneggers on the silver screen is that they love, they care, their appeal is found in their powerful ability to feel for those they love, to belong to something--a person, a community. They have a place for others in their hearts. That's why we also love Bruce Willis in the Die Hard films, because he fights for his family.

Sure, the ""Buck Rogers"" serial was cheaply made and quite silly, but that was when the talkies were still in black-and-white, and special effects were primitive.  As to ""Salt,"" here we have a contemporary, big budget, alleged thriller that is so absurd, it makes the ""Giant Claw"" look like a documentary.

In ""Salt,"" we see the CIA take ineptness to new levels, unable to corral Ms. Jolie even when she is sealed in a room in a CIA office building, with a SWAT team outside the door.  The clumsy chase scenes lack only Moe, Larry, and Curly.  This movie does not even try.  One gets the idea that even Seal Team 6 would be helpless when faced with a foe of the stature of Ms. Jolie.

Things are sure simpler today.  You can put anything on the screen, and you'll make money.  Can ""Salt II"" be far behind?",1304812800,4,898,4.36144578313253

Yup, that's the sum of it.  Some of it is predictable, there were some surprises, the ending was so obviously a set up for the sequel - couldn't they have been a little more subtle?

So a lot of bloody beatings and shootings, car chases and special effects, a hot babe who can beat up guys, and a lot of fake techno talk. The 'plot' is so absurd and implausible as to be funny in parts; something about Russian sleeper agents in the US, and absolutely everyone working for the US government eventually turns out to be one of them. Or something - they lost me on the details. Hasn't anyone told these people that the Cold War was over, er, some time ago?

But viewers don't seem to care. From a business angle, this piece of dreck brought $300M in revenues against a budget of $100M for production. I find this offensive. In no other industry (ie, honest hardworking industry) could such an indifferently conceived product earn two hundred million in a year. Hey, following the porn model, why not just give up any pretense of a story and film pure violence for two hours? Sad commentary on the Hollywood business model.

Now that I got that off my chest, Angelina is kind of fun in this movie, playing the James Bond instead of the James Bond chick. Pretty good for a scrawny 36 year old mother of six, although to keep her lips puffed up like that they must have brought in a 55 gallon drum of bee venom. Liev Schreiber is an excellent actor. And it was clever of her to steer the runaway police car by systematically tasering the driver; taser left to turn right, taser right to turn left, taser front to stop, taser back to accelerate.

3838607,1,B0021L8V0W,"First of all, the plot is set in motion by some Russian fed claiming in CIA offices that Angelina Jolie's character is a Russian sleeper.  Um, why?  Of course this sets in motion lots of gun fire, running around, car chases, etc.  But for plot - why?  Why did this guy say that she is a spy?  It serves him no purpose.  If he hadn't, his goals would have been reached in oh about 5 minutes.  Of course then the movie would have been 5 minutes, too.  Or maybe not made at all, which probably would have been best.  But that's the point - the whole premise makes no sense.

Personal pet peeve - movies about Russia and Eastern Europe made without even a rudimentary google search.  Liev Schrieber disappoints here - he is a Russian speaker and should have picked up some of the more ridiculous errors.  Like, for example, the fact that people who died in the Soviet Union in 1982 did not have massive Orthodox crosses on their graves.  It was a Communist state, there were no crosses!  There is not a single original headstone in all of Russia from 1982 with a cross.  This is pretty elementary.  Secondly, Angelina's Russian name is Chenkov.  Um, that's a man.  Not a ""can be male, can be female name.""  Chenkov, and any other -ov is a man, always, with zero exceptions.  Some Russians abroad anglicize their names so that the men and women of a family all have one surname, but in speech and always in reference to self they would use the feminine name.  So, Angelina Jolie was playing a man.  Some Russian big shot with the KGB had a massive ring with the KGB emblem on it.  What????  The KGB is not a high school or a football team, no one wore that kind of insignia publically.  And certainly no one kissed the ring - this is supposed to be Russia, not Sicily.  all in all, a completely idiotic movie.  Angelina Jolie is married to some dorky looking scientist, she beats up and kills hundreds of trained secret agents, kicking her little toothpick legs (while keeping hair perfect), and there is no plot.

3838608,1,B0021L8V0W,"Catering to the Lowest Denominator
This film is so cheesy it is practically a parody of bad action films.  The first 15 minutes are painfully trite and play more like a television drama episode than a planned narrative film.  The first scene shows a half-naked Angelina Jolie being tortured to the delight of perverts everywhere.  Then she is back in her desk job where lives out her normal spy life talking spy things to the mail boy and introducing herself as a spy so the political prisoners...I guess anonymity isn't an issue when you're a spy?  Then we have happy homemaker spy and evil Russians who (gasp) kidnap innocent children and train them to be assassins.  They might as well have thrown in the hero defeating Nazis and rescuing orphans and puppies while saving the whales and ending global warming.
Trying to list all the plot holes in this waste of film would take an eternity, so I'll just point out the bad film-making and poor decisions:

1. I counted four painfully long exposition monologues and dialogues, including a 20 minute ending which clearly should have been cut.
2. The character's behavior is completely out of character for a spy and her motivations are either lacking or idiotic (I'm going to kill secret service agents in order to NOT kill the president to let him know I'm NOT a killer!).
3. Took about three seconds to figure out who the bad guy was...maybe you can beat my time.
4. A SHOE KNIFE!!??!!
5. Jolie's wigs were awful.  Only one look worked for her in the film, and it was not the gender-bending one which I found disturbingly unreal.

While I'm surprised that so many people seem to like this stupid and pointless movie, I'm more pissed that filmmakers who underestimate audiences to the point that they must believe us all to be drooling inbred imbeciles seem to be continuously vindicated by the success of the crap they serve to us.",1303516800,,1882,4.681818181818182

3838642,4,B0021L8V0W,"As I've said several times before, the sub-genre of spy films (or espionage/spy thrillers as they're sometimes referred) has long been a popular well for Hollywood to draw from for inspiration and box office success. Typically these films have centered on a tough-as-nails male action hero type, many times with a strong desire for women and specific types of alcoholic beverages. In 2010, that all changed with the release of the action-packed thrill ride ""Salt"" starring Angelina Jolie (""Wanted"") in the title role.

""Salt"" chronicles the espionage powder keg that explodes when CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused of being a double agent for Russia tasked with assassinating the President of the United States. With her loyalty in question, her career in jeopardy, and the life she's known being turned on its ear; Salt will do whatever it takes to clear her name, reclaim her life, and prevent an international incident from occurring before time runs out.

Let me start by saying this: leave it to Angelina Jolie to be the first woman to successfully infiltrate this predominantly male headlined sub-genre of film. Not only that, but with her acting prowess, determination and physicality, be able to convincingly portray a character that can stand toe-to-toe with Bond and Bourne. Of course, this shouldn't be that surprising given that Angelina has proven time and again through various roles that there is not a single genre in which she cannot find success.

As the character of Evelyn Salt, Angelina is truly run through a veritable gauntlet of physical and emotional tests. In one scene she can be scaling the side of a very tall building (a stunt she performed herself) or witnessing a horrible act as she tries to remain stoic, but a subtly quivering lip belies her inner turmoil. Or desperately trying to convince those around her of the truth; no matter what the scene calls for Angelina always delivers to perfection.

I don't think there are too many other actresses out there, if any, that could have believably pulled off such a demanding role that is rife with intensity, duplicity, drama, and action. Sure several actresses could have handled some of the facets of the character, but all of them? In this I believe Angelina stands alone, and that is why I believe her to be probably the best, and certainly the most versatile, actress of her generation.

An interesting side note for the character is that originally Tom Cruise (""Mission: Impossible"") was attached to the role, but reportedly dropped out to film the romantic action comedy ""Knight and Day"". Thus, prompting the role to be rewritten from a male to a female, supposedly with Angelina in mind from then on.

Anyway, alongside Angelina are two very talented actors in the primary supporting roles, Liev Schreiber (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"") and Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Four Brothers"").

Liev plays a fellow CIA agent of Salt's named Ted Winter, and is the only person at the agency who seems to believe that she is innocent of the accusations against her. Liev's character is a mixture of the typical no-nonsense agent, but with a healthy sense of humor and a protective, brotherly relationship with Salt. Aside from those character traits, Liev also imbues the character with charm and an underlying sense that he will do whatever it takes to protect Salt whether she's innocent or guilty.

All together Liev's performance makes his character much more memorable than one would expect from such a role. Plus, the early scenes between him and Salt bantering back and forth are enjoyable to watch.

As for Chiwetel Ejiofor, he plays a government operative named Peabody who unlike Winter is not inclined to simply believe in Salt's innocence, despite her years of service to the red, white, and blue. For the most part, Ejiofor plays the role by the book as the clichd government stooge that is blind to anything except the evidence on display. Even with this fairly one-dimensional character, Chiwetel still manages to make his scenes pop, thanks entirely to his charismatic disposition.

One more bit of casting I would like to discuss before moving on, and this one in particular struck me as odd when watching this film. Why, oh why did Andre Braugher (""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"") sign on to the most thankless role of Secretary of Defense? With an actor of his caliber and credibility, one would expect that he signed on for the role due to it being such a good character. However, he's given nothing to do other than run around in one scene and hand phones to people, all the while saying only a sentence of dialogue.

Seriously, this is a role that should have been handled by some no-name actor or even someone like Cuba Gooding, Jr. who has been relegated to the realm of Direct-to-DVD. Wasting the talent of Andre Braugher on a role such as this is completely mind-boggling and somewhat insulting to his long-lasting career. But, overall this was a minor issue and I digress.

Of course the cast would be nothing without the script written by Kurt Wimmer (""A Perfect Getaway""), who has proven yet again to be a terrific storyteller. Loaded with twists and turns, gripping action set pieces, and engaging drama, the story for ""Salt"" is entertaining from start to finish.

Understandably with a movie like this one has to be careful in how much is revealed, because the risk of spoiling is incredibly high. So, the only other thing I will say about this film's story is this: at the end of the movie, I guarantee you will be left begging for more.

Now I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the other major contributor to this movie's success, director Phillip Noyce (""Clear and Present Danger""). With a movie so jam-packed with fast-paced, hard-hitting action scenes one would expect the movie to have been directed by someone more oriented with the action genre. Not to say that Phillip Noyce is unfamiliar with action scenes, it's just his films aren't generally so heavy in this area. Even so, he directs the pulse-pounding action with as sure a hand as he does during the quieter, more dramatic moments.

Also, Noyce's excellent directing and pacing of the film ensured that the story was provided plenty of breathing room to unfold naturally; that way it wouldn't seem as if the story was there to serve the action rather than the other way around. And the use of flashbacks, which can backfire for some films, was perfect for providing character development and context, while breaking up the monotony of linear storytelling. It's no wonder why Phillip Noyce is heralded as a master of the espionage thriller.

All in all, ""Salt"" is a thoroughly entertaining movie, filled to the brim with excitement and intrigue. This film and its star, Angelina Jolie, prove that they belong in the pantheon of spy thrillers and hopefully we haven't seen the last of Evelyn Salt.

""Salt"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1300838400,2,6942,4.889455782312925

The action sequences are quite breathtaking, but the problem is that you want Salt to die in each of them since she is so unlikable to the audience....also the stunt scenes don't just strain credibility, they snap it like a chop stick.

3838744,2,B0021L8V0W,"Sadly, I found this film only mildly entertaining.

Plot:  Angelina, as Evelyn Salt,  is an American spy working for the CIA.  When she is accused of being a Russian spy she starts running from the CIA.  While I liked the idea of the plot, I never really felt any sense of suspense.  Nor did I feel any edge of my seat concern for Angelina's physical well being--although I was concerned about the public's welfare when pursuing CIA agents were shooting through crowds of people and freeway traffic. And while it is not the reason for my 2-start rating, long before the movie ended, I figured which side Salt was really on.

Action scenes:  It was hard for me to believe that such a slightly built (thin) woman could do so much damage and stunt work and remain unscathed.  Example: Rolling over the wall of an overpass onto the roof of a semi and then leaping from there to a tanker with ease.  Except for the opening scene in Korea where skillful makeup makes her look realistically beaten up, Angelina never looks the worse for wear after her fight and action scenes--maybe a little blood, but few if any bruises and no limping or broken bones.  At one point in the film she removes her shoes and runs through the city and clings to a building ledge barefoot.  The skill with which she manages this, again without injury or noticeable pain, is not very realistic.

Angelina is a beautiful woman and I liked the idea of an attractive action character but a few of her physical attributes were distracting.  As another (maybe more) reviewer has mentioned, blond hair, or at least the particular shade chosen, does not suit Angelina's coloring. She looked washed out.  Later, she disguises herself by dyeing her hair black, and becomes the beautiful Angelina we all know.  It would have been more acceptable to have turned the disguise around. There would then have been a reason for the unnatural blond hair (it's a disguise!).  I also found Angelina's pouty lips distracting on more than one occasion.  If her lips are natural, I apologize, but if not, Angelina needs to cut back on the injections.

Fantasy Action Thriller?  I tried to suspend my disbelief and view this movie as an Arnold Schwarzenegger over the top comic book type film (which this film was not supposed to be). Could not do it.

In some ways I liked the movie, but I only gave it two stars because it was not possible for me to get ""lost"" in the plot and action.  There where just too many questionable film details that got in the way.  The idea of a female action figure to counter all the films with male action figures is admirable.  But, rather than creating a female version of a male action film, I would like to see Hollywood develop a distinctive female action style that takes into account the difference in body builds.",1297987200,,2802,4.602822580645161
3838745,4,B0021L8V0W,"First things first: is Salt the female James Bond? No, but it gives it an honest try.
Is the movie more enjoyable than a James Bond film? Certainly not true for a Sean Connery or a Pierce Brosnan film - but probably more enjoyable than the last Daniel Craig one.

The movie has to be experienced for what it is: an action thriller with spies, double and triple agents, guns, car chases, bridge jumps and you-gotta-be-kidding-me last millisecond saves. The story line is simple yet solid and, if you are familiar with Cold-War espionage plots (and post-Cold-War Russian oligarchy power struggles), not entirely implausible. I did not buy the effect the target of the plot could have or what the plotters aimed at; but this is neither a documentary nor an...Oscar contender. For two hours of escapist entertainment the movie delivers what it promises.

The producers made sure to plant a cliffhanging-hook to ensure the possibility of a franchise. It would take some fancy footwork from the writers' part but I can see it happening.

3838775,5,B0021L8V0W,"I rented this movie and watched it last night; I must say I was thoroughly impressed.  The story had plenty of action in it, but in all fairness was much more than merely another spy action flick.  They kept feeding you just enough contradicting information to keep you second guessing what you thought was really happening.

In case you haven't seen the previews, the story starts when a Russian defector turns himself in to the CIA to inform them about an assassination plot against the Russian president when he attends the American vice presidents funeral.  The final bit of information he gives on the plot is the name of the would-be assassin; Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie).  The part that I felt was never addressed in the previews was why she would run instead of just proving she wasn't going to kill anyone.  She runs because she is afraid that the Russians may have her husband and she leaves to find him.  I thought this added some realism to the movie rather than taking the direction ""Im going to run because Im innocent"".  At this point the movie is part Bourne, part The Fugitive and all around captivating.  I won't go any further that this so that there won't be any spoilers.

Here are a few other things that I liked about the movie, the first being the movie versions.  In a day and age when most movies try to milk you out of every penny offering a theatrical version, followed by the extended, and finally directors cuts of the movie, Salt offers all three versions on one Bluray.  I chose to watch the Directors Edition,  I haven't done the research to see what all the differences are as of yet, but I thought it would be a good place to start.  One of the differences that I noticed was the lack of ""sexual scenes"", especially those that were in the previews, gone is Angelina's typical ""sex symbol"" role.  I noticed this when I was watching the bonus content ""Salt: Disclosed"" and they flashed through a few scenes that were in the previews that I retroactively noticed weren't in the directors cut.  The thing that I liked about this is that usually ""directors cuts"" add in either more sex or violence that they had to cut to make a more favorable rating.  The fact that the director cut the ""sex"" to make the movie more like he wanted really stood out to me.  I don't have any problems with mature content in mature movies, but I thought it was admirable to not just cash in on the extra draw of more nudity or sexual situations, and rather focus on making the movie just how you want it.  Also retrospectively I noticed that I don't believe there was any profanity in the movie, or very little at most.  On the other hand the violence was quite brutal and abrupt.  I don't mean that it was gorey or over the top or uncalled for, quite the opposite.  It felt that the violence matched the type of people in the movie, these are all trained CIA and Russian agents, they aren't going to spend a lot of time hesitating to shoot someone who is a threat to them, and aren't going to waste a lot of time regretting having to have shot someone who just tried to kill them.

All these things together made a movie good enough that not only do I plan to purchase the movie, but I would like to go back and watch the other two versions of the movie and try and see what all the differences are.  Both Angelina and Liev put up great performances, and fans of either should watch this movie, also any fans of the spy/thriller genre will definitely enjoy it as well.",1297382400,7,3481,4.420062695924765
3838776,5,B0021L8V0W,"Great DVD. Worth getting.

3838777,4,B0021L8V0W,"The story is not brand new, but the execution is outstanding.

Chuck Palahniuk (author of ""Fight Club"") wrote a book called ""Pygmy"" about a group of asian kids trained to be sleeper agents to destroy the U.S. in a devious plot. I highly recommended the book.

The Manchurian Candidate was an outstanding movie about a dormant sleeper agent who runs for President, and is ""awoken"" at a crucial time in the story.

Jolie is excellent as an action actress. She's lost some of the hotness she once had (she just looks too bony now - I liked her curves). But she is a true badass in this film. Maybe a steamy scene would have helped. The film was well executed, and Jolie's character is believable when you allow yourself to suspend your disbelief for some of the action scenes. Some of the plot is predictable too soon, and the ""shocking"" reveals were not too surprising compared to ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" shocking reveals.

Angelina Jolie has proven she can do action, drama, comedy and romance, but the role of Evelyn Salt must have been written with her in mind because she is so perfect in it.  She carries the movie, very well, thank you, in virtually every scene and through numerous fight scenes.  It is believable and throughly involving.  It's a mystery/thriller, a spy movie, and a super action-packed roller-coaster ride of great entertainment.  Very watchable, and well worth the money to buy and watch again and again.  My only suggestion is...more, please?",1297123200,4,848,4.840277777777778
3838779,3,B0021L8V0W,"I enjoy spy films, and remember having liked the 1994 ""Clear and Present Danger"" (starring Harrison Ford), also directed by Phillip Noyce, so I decided to see ""Salt"" and bought the Blu-ray from Amazon.  The disk has all three versions and lots of interesting extra features, including a commentary by Phillip Noyce, and interviews with real-life spies, such as the famous former Counterintelligence KGB General Oleg Kalugin, now an American citizen.

""Salt"" is an enjoyable film, better, I say, than all Bourne films, or ""Mission Impossible"", with the possible exception of the 1996 one, directed by Brian de Palma, where Angelina Jolie's father plays, and also better than many James Bond films, with, perhaps, the exception of the 1963 ""From Russia with Love"", from which ""Salts"" borrows something - remember Colonel Rosa Klebb played by Lotte Lenya ?

Moles in the CIA (and FBI), ""sleepers"", ""illegals"" in dormant state waiting to be activated for sinister purposes against the West, Soviet/Russian (KGB, SVR, FSB) defectors after defectors ... all are true and not new (Kalugin confirms this) - see ""Telefon"" (1977, with Charles Bronson), ""The Fourth Protocol"" (1987, with Pierce Brosnan), ""The Good Shepherd"" (2006, also with Angelina Jolie), ""The Company"" (2007, TV with Michael Keaton).

Angelina Jolie, Liev Schrieber, and Daniel Olbrychski do well, and, like many others, I liked watching them, but I have two serious problems with the plot.  Not so much the impossible acrobatics, escapes and infiltrations ... but the premise of the film itself:
- How is it possible to depict (and make us believe that) The Secret Service is so ineffective ... Bystanders ... ?
- The ""defector"".
1. A Russian spy comes to the CIA and reveals top secrets about former Soviet, now Russian operations against the United States.  He even uncovers the identity of a mole inside CIA ranks.  OK - Good deeds !  But, if he is a genuine defector, why, after being interviewed, does he kill his CIA guards, and then escapes ?  Doing this only discredits his testimony.  That is not how a genuine defector behaves.
2. If, on the other hand he is not a genuine defector, but an active enemy agent, someone who came to activate ""sleepers"", why does he have to come in and reveal everything to the CIA, including uncovering the identity of a top mole in the CIA, thus, gravely endangering the mission his agents (the sleepers) are to carry out ?  If he only needed to provide instructions to his undercover agents, he could have used other methods of communication.  This is not how an offensive (let us call him ""a non-genuine defector"") behaves.
3. If, further, this was is a temporary defection, with the sole purpose of uncovering to the CIA the identity of a mole (the Theatrical and Director's Cut versions of the film, but not the Extended version suggests this), than it was not at all necessary to reveal the rest of the plan to the CIA (that this mole, a Russian agent will soon attempt to kill ...), and, definitely, it was absolutely wrong for the defector to kill his guards and escape.  Credibility !
So, bad logic. Am I wrong ?

We, the viewers like thrillers, action, adventure, spy stuff (deception after deception, double-cross, double agents), but we also like solid, smart and plausible intelligence (brain, analytical) work behind the action - e.g. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" (1979, TV) and  ""Smiley's People"" (1982, TV), both with Alec Guiness.  Not too much ""intelligence"" work in ""Salt"", just a lot of (great !) action sequences ... there is too much Phillip Noyce expects us to accept, take for granted.

On the positive side:  ""Salt"" may also be viewed as the soul-searching journey of a double-agent who struggles with the question: ""On which side am I ?"" or ""On which side should I be ?""  In the end, the agent decides where the allegiance should be placed, and choses the side who advocates morality and humanity.

If you do not ask (too many) questions, ""Salt"" is definitely enjoyable, and the Blu-ray disk is great.",1297036800,2,4031,4.882697947214076
3838780,4,B0021L8V0W,"Salt is a Bourne film on speed -- that's the best way to describe it. Evelyn Salt, as portrayed by Angelina Jolie, is a super-spy who spends the vast majority of the movie running, jumping, fighting, blowing stuff up, and generally causing all sorts of really cool looking mayhem. This is an action movie, through and through. The suspension of disbelief is mandatory here, because without it the audience won't last more than 15 minutes. Salt tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who is set up (or is she?) by a mysterious Russian agent. According to him, Salt is in fact a Russian spy planning to assassinate the Russian president, providing Russia with provocation to launch their own attacks on the United States. Convoluted? Sure. Ridiculous? Maybe. However, once Jolie launches into action, the film never stops for a breather and what follows are some of the best action sequences in recent memory.

The fact that Salt succeeds despite a fairly ludicrous central plot is a testament to the prowess of Angelina Jolie. With the Tomb Raider films, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Wanted, and now Salt, Jolie has proven to be not only one of the biggest movie stars on the planet, but perhaps it's biggest action star as well. The fact that we are talking about a woman who probably tips the scales at 115 pounds is a testament to the charisma and power that Jolie conveys onscreen. You just believe that she could take on two armed secret service agents in a narrow hallway and leave them both unconscious. Angelina Jolie is one of the very few true movie stars left, and Salt would not work without her. Liev Shreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor play the agents assigned to catch Salt and both do a predictably good job. Shreiber, in particular, has really come into his own lately and it's nice to see him working with good material after the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

Aside from the breakneck pace and star power of Jolie, the greatest thing that Salt has going for it is the mystery of Evelyn Salt's true intentions. Is she really a Russian spy? Or is she playing both sides? Just who is she working for? The screenplay by Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) does a good job of keeping the audience guessing right up to the finale. Yes, the screenplay can get a bit ridiculous, but that's par for the course in this type of film. It should be stressed that this is not Syriana, or even a Bourne film. Phillip Noyce previously brought us both Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger and this time around he largely ignores the political machinations and double-crosses of the Jack Ryan films for a more action-focused entry. Nevertheless, the pedigree is there and Salt remains a damn fine political thriller. Noyce takes it to the next level, a level filled with more explosions, more car chases, and more hand-t0-hand combat. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea that's fine, but for the rest of us, this is the action movie of the summer, thus far. Enjoy Salt for what it is.

3838782,5,B0021L8V0W,"As the advertisement asks, ""A you (firt name) Salt? Yes. Then you are a russian spy."" There is a person saying that Jolie is working for another country, Jolie saying she has to make sure her loved ones are safe, and the world seeing chasing after her. As the plots begin to spin, you begin to wonder if anyone is who they say they are and who, exactly, Salt is. she is ruthless, that's for sure, and she knows her stuff. Still, she is an agent with a past and that past is something that mingles with some high profile people.

Salt is one of those movies that hits the ground running and waits for you to catch up. For an adrenile movie it has something of a complex plot (meaning it is complex on a Hollywood standard but a C- when looked out outisde of action), and i think this helps it. In the beginning you actually see how hard things are for an agent, see how complex it is when you work as a supposed spy, and then have that bubble deflated for you. you also have love added into the equation, making things interesting.

When you look at this movie, a lot of it does revolve around the notion of love. From the start this is explain and given as part of the character, and from that start you gage what is transpiring. I have to hand it to jolie on this job because she seems to hold her own on all fields and she does it with style and a bit of mystery to her. Considering her real life and the microscope she operates under, you can see just how well this is portrayed there.

The action here is fast, is solid, and the ideas are good. The movie is a run, Lola, run movie with a lot of firepower, and there are positions of the plot map that make you say ""cool."" I like the way some things happen and the way Salt stays ahead, but the movie doesn't make her chasing people's total fools. They are not far behind and she seems ready, but a plot portion of the movie and the past explains this. And, again, you cannot for the love piece.

As much as this is the same movie in some ways, it differs in some good ways as well. The way jolie gets to do things, interesting things, to get out is interesting to me as well. I liked the fact that we do not see bullets into a wall as some means to get out or shooting hundreds of people. We are also not given watered down ideas but have enough of a plot to work on today's terror system. Combine that with the man in her life and I took interest, sadness, love, revenge, and so much more out of moments here. It was a nice 5, provided you know what you are into here.

The one CIA guy that does his darndest to kill her ....that was a bit poorly done and but the upside was it kept things just slightly off kilter which isn't a bad thing.

It was sort of predictable, but not so that you couldn't enjoy it. One stunt pushed the limit a little too far, but it was still entertaining. My wife said she felt like she wanted a nice action with some drama movie and she decided on Salt. We weren't disappointed and in this version, you definitely feel like it was left open for a sequel. Angelina Jolie made the character believeable. Her expressions in the closeups in tight moments was good. The fight choreography was really good, imo and she carried it off without a hitch. I hope there is a sequel.

I usually give an action flick a high rating if it's better than I expected, if I wished it was longer, or if I tend to miss that it was slow in various parts of the movie. I didn't have a problem with the believability of the film as I understand that with many flicks we need to suspend disbelief. Truth is stranger than fiction so it's possible that some of the covert missions of various forms of the government actually happen. If you listen to accounts from the Navy SEALS it sounds possible. Can she do any of this? I don't know, so I suspend disbelief.

I like that she was able to (as another reviewer suggested) lay waste to her compadres. She was deftly able to manage counterattacks. She seemed to be a peer among her friends, and that she had a good sense of her role was impressive.

I know people swoon over her but I don't find her attractive, and her appearance takes away from the enjoyment of her films. She is entirely too skinny and  her lips are a distraction. I find that her body is off kilter somehow. WHO she is as an actress is part of the overall flavor of the film for me her appearance detracts from the rating.",1296345600,,1179,4.226666666666667
3838820,3,B0021L8V0W,"""Salt"" is named after the character played in this film by Angelina Jolie.  It is not too much to say that this film appears to have been essentially designed to showcase Jolie's great looks and ability to carry off a non-stop action film.  The action in this film starts early and never ends.  The action scenes are well-done and exciting.  Of course, the trade-off is that to a significant extent the action comes at the sacrifice of more plot and character development.

All that having been said, this film does have an interesting storyline; something of a ""Charm School"" theme for my fellow Nelso DeMille fans.  Without giving much of anything away (very minor spoiler) the plot here is that the Cold War Soviets have infiltrated the USA with Russian sleeper agents who were trained from childhood to pass as Americans.  Needless to say they are up to no good.  And therein lies the basic story of this film.

My whole family enjoyed watching ""Salt"" and it is certainly good enough, and nuanced enough, to justify watching more than once.  Recommended.  RJB.",1296345600,3,1064,4.791208791208791

However...it's still quite fun. The pace is fast, the action good, the acting fantastic (Jolie is hardly my favorite actress, but she does a smashing job in this role -- at its most unbelievable parts, you still somehow believe her). The movie doesn't slow down enough to let you think about the plot...so you don't, and it seems to make sense (until it ends). Once its over, it was so much fun to watch that the plot holes give you pause, but don't destroy your sense of enjoyment.

Having worked in television and film, and as a journalist/critic, I have to preface my remarks with a little proverb: ""it is what it is."" This film makes no pretenses. It is a girl-kicks-ass, action flick, not wholly unlike Gena Davis'The Long Kiss Goodnight. All this talk about character and story development....balderdash! How much backstory do we get in early Bond flicks? It is formulaic and we dig that we know what to expect: action, action and more action....then there is the sex, but, in this, Salt is her own sex symbol, so why muddy up the waters with a token, male piece of ass.
The first act, where she runs from the CIA, after being exposed as a Russian mole, is pretty intense, action-wise. If you take nine minutes to watch the video on making the film (available on Video-On-Demand for free) you will see that Jolie is into the physicality of the stunt work.....and does she get to play here!
Although the slim storyline is reminiscent of Bond films, it is the incredibility of the stunts that make it exceptional. There is little or no method acting involved, all physical. Dialog is almost non-existent. But, of course....it's not about wooing the viewer, but, rather, getting the viewer to grip the edge of their seat.
Yes, it is open-ended, but with the Bourne Trilogy don't we ask ourselves WWJD (What would Jason do?). Here, I wonder, as always mystified, WWJD (What will Jolie Do?), and as always, I am pleased as punch (pun intended).",1296086400,2,1510,4.7018867924528305

I should have quit, because the end took me from indifferent to angered.  There were a few decent action sequences, but there's no way I'd recommend this confused film to anybody.

I'm not a hardcore Angelina Jolie fan, but have enjoyed most of the action films that she's headed up.  Salt was certainly the exception to the rule.

Following a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian sleeper agent who then goes on the run, we see Jolie shoot and fight her way out of numerous scrapes.

This is one of those films you need to suspend your disbelief to fully enjoy as it has so many inaccuracies and far fetched aspects that you could very quickly wind yourself up by pointing them all out.  If you manage to do this you should be able to enjoy this for what it is; a fast paced, espionage action film where you don't need to think to hard to enjoy it.  You can guess the various twists and plot revelations very early on, but it doesn't stop them being enjoyable when they are revealed.

Jolie is very bland in this film, as are all the actors really and Li ev Shreiber is probably the best actor on offer.  The direction is ok, nothing special and the stunts are adequate enough.

All in all this is a perfectly serviceable spy action film and like I mentioned at the start, for all it's flaws (which are numerous) it does still manage to entertain, which is about all we can hope for.  Worth a viewing, just don't expect anything outstanding.

Ultimately such films are merely flimsy vehicles for the numerous high-energy chase/fight scenes, and as such I find them ultimately unsatisfying (except for the Bourne films - I found that Matt Damon was able to breathe life into Jason Bourne much more than Angelina was with Evelyn Salt).

So, it comes down to taste.

There is the constant, ""is she, or isn't she?"" question which always makes for a good suspense film.  I was pretty impressed with the DC scenes (as I live here).  It was a pretty good mix of real scenes and some staged sets.  All in all, a good film.

That said, the whole ""video on demand"" concept needs to ramp up the picture quality to full-screen and not a dumbed-down version of 16:9.  The sound quality could be better.

So Angelina Jolie is exposed as a Russian agent...spends most of the movie running from her coworkers at the CIA because she swears she's not. Then she kills some guy as her duty to a Russian agent. She then watches her husband get killed by the Russians. Then she kills all the Russian agents. Because the Russians killed her husband she wants to kill them all. So the very gentle nuance is that she let go of 20 years+ of loyalty because her husband was killed. Oh, and one of her CIA coworkers is also a Russian Spy. That is the ENTIRE plot.

I personally like seeing her in action roles such as the two Laura Croft movies, Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Wanted.  SALT is my favorite Angelina Jolie film at this time.  SALT is an action packed film that feels like a roller coaster ride. One of the many things I like about Angelina is that she actually does most of the stunts in her films, which makes it more real for me.  This DVD has 3 versions of the film.

3839023,4,B0021L8V0W,"I was reading the other reviews and was frustrated to see reviews slamming this saying their Bluray player wouldn't play it. I made a few comments on their reviews to post under the bluray edition and not the reg. DVD but guess what, Amazon is mixing the reviews from each edition. Yes, when you read a review on it's own, it will tell you on the right side which edition it is. Now, these reviews from other editions are reflected on this edition? Not cool.
On to the review of the Spec. Edition I saw.
I will admit that when I saw the trailers I said, ""Why is she so thin?"" and ""I'm not sure if I'll see this.""
Common complaints are that, ""How is a 100lb anorexic woman taking on multiple armed guards and doing all these amazing things?"" and I have to agree. THAT part was just too much for me. Being a past martial arts student, my sensei would teach different students how to protect themselves by the basics but then would take some students that were smaller or very large and teach them alt. ways to survive/fight based off their particular differences or limitations. There is no way she would be landing these blows and doing any real damage. So...fight choreography gets a big thumbs down.
The misleading trailer made it appear that in the beginning Salt is told she is a secret spy and goes on the run immediately and it made it look like she was innocent and was running to clear her name. The edition I saw (Extended edition) was a very different story line. I won't post spoilers but you know very early if she is a spy or not. Why she would run if innocent? Maybe because she knew that the accusation would get her killed? Maybe she really is a spy?
Other complaints that she could move about undetected by changing her contacts and teeth? Hmm maybe, possible but improbable.
I will recommend it for the action movie enthusiest and say that if that is what you want, that is what you will get. Not a bad plot, not bad acting but some stuff is simply unbelievable dropping my rating to 3-4 stars.",1294704000,3,2011,4.394101876675603

3839052,3,B0021L8V0W,"I bought myself, er, I mean the family, a Panasonic Viera 65"" Plasma teevee and a Panasonic Blu-Ray player for Christmas. Yay me. They're both awesome and replace some 5ish-year old HD teevee/dvd units. I paid the extra for a professional to calibrate the new units and all I can say is... Wow. It is a phenomenal setup including the 7.1 surround system we already had and that the audio is hooked up to.

Now, I've never used the Viera Cast or any other streaming internet movie service before, but both the new teevee and the new Blu-Ray player have it. Included with the internet streaming services in Viera Cast are four internet-based streaming movie providers; Netflix, Amazon-On-Demand, Vudu, and CinemaNow. I refuse to use Netflix as it is pay-per-month whether you use it or not, their selection of new titles is deeply lacking, and there are extra per-month fee's for basic services you would think the subscription would already include. CinemaNow is just a plain awful streaming movie app with a terrible selection of what they call 'newer titles' that are already quite old so I won't use that one either. However, I did fire up and try out Amazon-On-Demand and Vudu.

Using Amazon-On-Demand I watched the (so-called) HD version of SALT. While the movie was good for the most part, it looked absolutely TERRIBLE using Amazon-On-Demand. It might as well have been the standard DVD version. It streamed great over wifi with no buffering but the visual quality was absurdly less than HD quality. I highly doubt I'll ever use Amazon-On-Demand ever again if that is what Amazon considers HD quality.

Then I watched Inception using the VUDU (VUDU.com) service and it was like I had a HD disc in the Blu-Ray player. The visual and audio quality was very exceptional and it also streamed with no buffering at all. There was no comparison and the VUDU service blows Amazon-On-Demand out of the water. The quality of VUDU even far surpasses my Cox-On-Demand service. Also, VUDU gets and provides many more new releases on the same day that the DVD hits stores than Amazon does. That is also a big plus.

Unless Amazon-On-Demand redefines and up converts its definition of what they consider HD quality, I won't use it anymore. If you can't get VUDU with your teevee or Blu-Ray player they offer hookups on Amazon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VUDU-Wireless-Kit/dp/B001AS0F1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VUDU Wireless Kit</a>",1294444800,11,2473,5.129032258064516

This movie has a lot of potential in which Philip Noyce the director tried to make a real good story out of it but may had failed in some points in the movie.

With a few exceptions, all of the chasing, fighting and shooting was aimed at stopping the bad guys, not killing them.  I am sure that Jolie did not do many of the stunts, but it was filmed and edited so well that one could not tell if it was her performing the death defying actions of her character.  The premise and story of the film added to its interest but a number of motivations and actions were either unclear or somewhat non-sensical.  This may have been due to editing out some of the details or just not incorporating them to begin with.  However, these weaknesses could probably be cured by writing more specific purpose for several scenes that would not take more that an additional 5 or 10 minutes of film.  I did watch the film twice to make sure I did not miss certain explanatory information.  I do not think I missed anything of significance.

So, I rate this film 5 stars for its excitement and enjoyment but reduce that rating by 1 star because the film was not logically and tightly put together as it could have been.  If you are not a super critical viewer, this film should provide excitement and enjoyment sufficient to take your mind off the economic and other problems many of us may currently have to deal with.

Male actors tend to work there body really for that type of role, females should do the same. I want a woman looking like Michelle Rodriguez body at least... but I guess she is to latina for the role, but she does look the part, or Angie please start to eat.

In combat, her application of Muay Thai and Krav Maga allows her to dispose of her opponents directly and viciously and often permanently. Evelyn Salt is a highly skilled, highly lethal CIA operative. When she's set up and fingered as a Russian sleeper agent, her immediate concern is for her husband's safety. Evelyn Salt goes on the lam, and so re-enforces the accusation placed against her. The CIA goes on the warpath. But so does Evelyn Salt.

Decades out of relevance, the Cold War strikes again. Somewhere, John Le Carr and Robert Ludlum are smiling. SALT is an engrossing espionage thriller and so twisty it had me half-convinced that I'm a Russian mole. It's not long before you start questioning Evelyn Salt's every move. Who is Evelyn Salt? What's her true agenda? Where is her allegiance? You don't learn for certain until deep into the film, when Salt is put in a position to prevent a nuclear holocaust... or trigger it.

This is old hat for Angelina Jolie. Her mojo is such that she carries the film effortlessly. I'm not even that surprised to learn that SALT, in its early stages, intended to feature Tom Cruise as ""Evan Salt."" Jolie belongs to an elite club. She's one of those very few actresses who is sexy, can act, and do some serious buttkicking. Off the top of my head, there are Jolie, Yeoh, Jovovich, Hamilton, and Weaver - and all have presence. Jolie has great acting chops. She commits to her role, not only tonally, but physically. Although, fine, I don't think she quite pulls off her disguise as a Russian officer. Still, it's an impressive sight watching a seriously pisssed Salt embark on a killing spree. Let me say, though, that it's just really wrong how, from the back seat of a speeding car, a captive Salt remote controls the cop driver thru rampant application of her taser (and yet I couldn't stop laughing). And like Yeoh and Jovovich, Jolie relishes performing her own stunts, so she's no wilting lily. Speaking of stunts, the most spectacular one involves Salt's various insane leaps onto the roofs of various trucks criss-crossing on the freeways. My jaw got all agape.

Don't mean to dis the menfolk. Liev Schreiber lends gravitas as Salt's CIA friend and colleague who reluctantly joins in the (wo)man hunt. Dude is a good actor and makes a good foil for Jolie. Meanwhile, Chiwetel Ejiofor - playing a by-the-books government agent - becomes the Tommy Lee Jones to Jolie's Harrison Ford. SALT is more action-packed than it is cerebral.

Anyway, I sat down on a rainy night and decided to watch this movie.  All I can say is WOW!  It was pure action for 55 minutes out of the 104 minutes of the movie.

For you nit pickers out there some details were a little skecthy and may cause you to question accuracy.  However, remember it's only a movie for entertainment purposes not a documentary to provide facts.  In other words just sit back enjoy the movie.",1294012800,2,653,4.436974789915967
3839103,3,B0021L8V0W,"Just because I issued only 3 stars to SALT, doesn't mean that it isn't a good movie. It is definately worth watching and entertaining depending on your taste in movies. Yet, in recent years, Hollywood, screenwriters and movie producers have taken a poor step in the keep em' happy direction. 'Keep em' happy' in the sense of the movie shouldn't stop. The audience paid for action and their gonna get it.

Well, the audience is getting action, but at the expense of character development and setup and explanation and just plain mood. There is little to zero effort by the filmmakers to let us know what is going on inside the main character, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie).

The movie opens up with a violent scene of interrogation as Salt is beaten by N.Korean soldiers, accused of being a spy as she repeatedly assures them that she isn't a spy. The audience affectively wonders if maybe she isn't a spy and she is a victim of mistaken identity. Yet, as the scene breaks and she is escorted back to an American helicopter, released by some high power, the movie then jumps to a scene where we discover, quite unceremoniously that, well, she is a spy and an agent for the U.S. government.

This pretty much sums up the entire movie from that point on. There are many twists and turns in SALT, but none of them have an ounce of setup or tactic to keep the audience guessing. Everything is right in your face and gets straight to the action, as if the entire movie viewing world weren't smart enough to be toyed with.

None of the twists and turns in SALT, and there are many, garner a gasp, or surprise or any reaction other than, ""where's the popcorn?""

A good movie that will fall, if it hasn't already, into the pile of movies that will not be thought of ever again, 3 weeks after its video release.",1294012800,5,1800,4.492354740061162

3839105,3,B0021L8V0W,"I had very little interest in seeing this when it came out.  Reviews proclaimed that Angelina Jolie was the female Bourne - and I assumed that meant Lara Croft with a bit more smolder and sweat, in a slightly more realistic setting.  No thanks.

But I was wrong.  I really liked this.  Salt is every bit as intense as the Bourne trilogy, and Jolie pulls it off with style.  It's not at all plausible, but neither is Bourne; and in both series the non-stop action kept me so engaged I never had time to wonder whether it made any sense until afterwards.  While it's happening it's simply intense and exciting, and kept me guessing.  I did anticipate the major twist towards the end, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.  The basic set up - of a defecting KGB agent, who tells the CIA that Salt is a sleeper double agent, allegedly as his only way to get her activated and give her a mission - is pretty far fetched when you stop and think about it.  The action also, is over and above what's humanly possible - but it's rendered so precisely that you don't get lost while it's going on.  What struck me, afterwards, is that Salt managed to achieve the same intensity as, say, the Bourne Ultimatum, but without the lack of clarity that you find in that film due to the shaky camera and jump cuts.

Salt's a fun flick - an intense and exhilarating, non-stop, keeps-you-guessing spy game.  It looks great on Blu-Ray, and includes an extended edition and director's cut.  The director's cut is the best - it adds a bit more graphic violence, but also gives a bit more clarity about the characters and their relationships.",1293840000,4,1619,4.425675675675675

Besides her role as Lara Croft in two 'TOMB RAIDER' films and her underrated performance in Timur Backmambetov's 'WANTED', this may be her best role ever. Veteran Director Philip Noyce pulls out all the stops in filming sequences where she resembles a spider, the insect which her on screen husband is an expert on and the tense editing by Stuart Baird and John Gilroy , aided by crisp photography by Robert Elswit, propels the affair through double crosses and James Bond territory (note hommages to 'DIE ANOTHER DAY': the North Korean opening in the Directors cut; 'FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE' with Orlav's knife in the shoe fight sequence in an elevator; traces of sleeper themes from 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT  and even USA television's brilliant series 'BURN NOTICE' with our heroines escape from a helicopter over the Potomac River as Michael Weston did at the end of season two). There are 3 different versions to choose from and I saw the Director's cut which seems to have differed from the theatrical.

3839160,4,B0021L8V0W,"(Unrated version) WARNING: This review may contain unintentional plot spoilers. The movie had me hooked about 20 minutes into it. Angelina Jolie spends 2 years in a N.Korean prison out of the reach of Jimmy Carter. She is released in a spy swap. She works for a dummy CIA company in New York which doesn't have a metal detector sophisticated enough to detect knife blades inside of shoes. After Jolie is back in NYC, a Russian defector comes in from the cold and tells us, and the CIA, the plot of the movie. He claims Angelina (Salt) is really a Russian mole, planted here as a child and she is going to kill the Russian president. Salt denies this, and runs away before she could clear herself in order to save her husband. There are numerous minor flashbacks during the movie to fill in plot points. They also make the predictable ""twists"" predictable enough for dummies.

The film makes fun of the real Angelina who can't cook, but can do everything else. She can make a better cannon than William Shatner out of household items. Bobby Clark (Gorn)in a rubber mask would not have stood a chance. She can scale a building in her bare feet and split skirt better than Spider Man (or Spider Babe for Misty Mundae fans). Salt can also jump from the top of truck to truck, better than Tom Cruise and that is after taking a bullet to the hip, which doesn't even give her a limp. Jolie can ride a motorcycle as well as Evel Knievel and can beat up men quicker than Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. I am not sure why the NYPD handcuffed people with their hands in the front. I guess the ""behind the back"" cuff would have made the escape too unbelievable. And Bruce Willis could have taken notes on how to climb down an elevator shaft from Salt.

And during the whole time, her makeup never ran or hair came out of place. Okay, we'll forgive you about not being able to cook.",1293753600,,1863,4.397101449275362
3839161,4,B0021L8V0W,"As a huge fan of the genre I really enjoyed this film.  Sure it wasn't mindblowing but it was still very good and Angelina was surprisingly good in her role.  Just a hint - go for the unrated extended cut which is a far more complete film than what was released in theaters.  That was what I watched and I didn't have some of the issues that people had that saw it in the theater.  On the extras the director or producer was exclaiming that he had never seen a woman involved in an action story at this level.  Sorry, but apparently he missed the 125 hours of the ALIAS TV series which re-defined the spy genre - so much so that Bond had to be reworked it looked so bad in comparison.  And although Evelyn Salt was good, she wouldn't last 10 seconds against Sidyney Bristow.  But that aside, the film was full of action and kept the plot lively and guessing until the end.",1293667200,2,872,4.216867469879518
3839162,4,B0021L8V0W,"I honestly was not expecting to like this movie. I am more of a Bourne and Bond movie fan. I thought Salt looked a little too predictable and focused more on the action than any sort of story line. I was mostly incorrect.

The story is great. Almost half way through it I was a little disappointed because I ""thought"" I figured out the entire plot. But Salt still had a few twists coming up. There are many flashbacks, which bring in a lot more character development and story-line understanding throughout the film.

The acting is quite good. I am a fan of Angelina and Liev Schreiber and they both did a knockout job and worked very very well together.

The PQ and AQ are both amazing. I was very impressed with the quality.

Salt was very entertaining throughout and kept me guessing. The speed of the film and the over-all style was great. I highly recommend Salt.",1293667200,,868,4.474683544303797
3839163,1,B0021L8V0W,"They say that if you 'suspend disbelief' for some movies then you will like it. With this film I coudn't do it. This movie is way over the top unbelievable. And thus I couldn't get into it. The director copies the film style and editing techniques of the Jason Bourne movies. The Bourne movies you will recall were hugely successful and had great action scenes. When Bourne took on other super elite spies you got the feeling of danger, that he could be killed or captured. Not here. The skinny armed heroine takes on a bunch of SWAT guys in hand to hand combat with no problem, takes on a whole ship full of nasty Russians again with no problem. This movie was reportedly slotted for T. Cruise but he turned it down/had other projects to work on. Jolie gets it and there is apparently no script rewrite to show the difference of how a female spy would vanquish her foes.

The plot shows Salt as a dedicated trusted US trained spy. But evidence comes to light that shows she assisted Russian spies. Rather than explain herself, tell how it's all wrong, she goes on the run and the audience is left to wonder what side she is truly on. Fair enough, but again the action scenes are so preposterous that I lost interest. The usual good work of British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (Redbelt, Serenity & Children of Men) is wasted here. I don't want to give anything away but when you see the scene where she, a presumed rogue Russian killer, has to get to the President at the WH and they know she's coming yet still pulls it off - then you will know that it is a ridiculous waste. Rather than waste $ on this 2nd rate film I would recommend these way better espionage films as substitutes - of course you can't go wrong with the previously mentioned Bourne films. Also 'Body of Lies' with DiCaprio, 'Ronin' with Deniro or even 'Scorpio'(old school) with Burt Lancaster. All way better.",1293580800,25,1876,4.469387755102041
3839164,1,B0021L8V0W,"Everything you see here, you have seen it done better before somewhere else. They are all very easily recognizable. Angelina Jolie really should stick to what she does well, whatever that is. She was barely adequate for Laura Croft, but playing a highly trained assassin is definitely not her thing. The action sequences in this one are painful to watch. Angelina seems slow and weak, and simply fling her arms around most of the time, completely lacks the calculated power and cold efficiency that I would expect from a well conditioned spy. The plot has some big holes, but I only saw the theatrical cut, which from the other comments here, makes even less sense than the other versions.",1293580800,9,689,4.798319327731092
3839165,5,B0021L8V0W,"Angelina Jolie has definitely reached star status. She makes films that have a certain cerebral quality that the critics enjoy but she remains true to her fans, those that bought repeat tickets to see TOMB RAIDER, by making action films as well. And if nothing else SALT is a non stop action thrill ride that those fans will love but with enough story to satisfy the critics.

Jolie stars as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who as the film starts has been captured by the North Koreans and then traded due to the insistence of her boyfriend, an arachnologist (he studies spiders) she was involved with. The two marry and Evelyn continues working for the CIA without his apparent knowledge.

Move forward two years and Evelyn is about to go home for the night. But she and her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) are stopped before going to interrogate a man who has just turned himself in saying he was a Russian spy and knows of a big event about to take place. As she interrogates the man he tells her about a spy movement begun during the cold war when deep undercover spies were placed throughout the U.S. to be activated years later. That time is now. Viewing his statement as nothing more than talk, she begins to leave until he tells her the name of the spy who will assassinate the Russian president: Evelyn Salt.

The team goes on high alert and Evelyn is place in a holding cell till they can sort through it all. The Russian is being escorted to a cell of his own but kills his guards and escapes. Fearful of what might happen to her husband, Evelyn breaks out on her own after a creative escape. She has to find him and protect him.

While Ted continues to defend Salt, Agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) (a sort of internal affairs agent) leads the chase to bring Salt back into custody and prevent what appears to be a legitimate threat to the Russian president. Set to deliver the eulogy for the recently deceased Vice President, the assassination could result in a world war.

Salt is tracked to her apartment where she finds the remains of an abduction of her husband, her worst fears come to pass. She barely makes it out before the CIA comes crashing in but once she hits the streets they follow. A sequence involving Salt jumping from the top of one semi-truck to another makes for one of the best chase scenes filmed in some time.

Salt makes her escape, changes her look and begins preparing...to assassinate the Russian president! This is where the film brings on a fantastic twist. Where we would normally think that since this is Jolie she has to be innocent, we're suddenly wondering if she really could be the spy they think she is, an assassin. And when she causes panic and blows up the floor of the church where the Vice President's funeral is taking place, bringing the Russian president down a floor and into her gun sights, who knows if she is innocent of guilty?

But long viewing film fans will figure out pieces of the puzzle before the last minutes of the film. As Salt continues on her path, reuniting with the Russian agent we saw her interrogate, more deep cover spies are revealed. It seems there was more to this story. Perhaps hundreds of these spies were placed long ago and now the plan is to turn them lose in an attempt to destroy the United States. Will Salt be the one to bring this plan to its ultimate goal or is she really trying to stop it before it begins?

You'll have to watch to find out in a movie that has the feel of a roller coaster ride, swinging you this way and that until you roll into the station. The action is non stop, enhanced by both fantastic stunt work and a fast paced musical score that adds to the mix.

Jolie does a great job here and should win over new fans. She offers both a tender side to the character as she worries about her husband and a killer side that plots out the destruction of those set in her sights. Best of all she switches those emotions without words but with acting, a tough job to accomplish. Best of all she takes a predominately male type role and offers an incredibly strong female combatant to the spy genre.

The ending of the film offers a surprise of its own. What appears to be the final twist in the tale is given another little nudge that means perhaps a SALT 2 is in the making. At least the possibility is there.",1293580800,4,4312,4.419395465994962
3839166,5,B0021L8V0W,I usually do not like Angelina Jolie's movies too much but I loved Salt. There were so many twist and turns through out the movie. It did have me guessing what was going on. I had a feeling who the real mole was and I was right but then her actions in the movie made me doubt myself. It's a movie I will be watching more than once.,1293580800,3,331,3.8823529411764706
3839167,1,B0021L8V0W,"I'm a little shocked at some of the glowing reviews of this movie. First off, I am a conspiracy buff and love action movies with a ""thinking man"" element to them. This movie's action sequences were ridiculously implausible. Granted, some of that is to be expected. But, it's the plot that makes this movie absurd.

*Spoiler Alert*

At one point in the movie, Jolie crosses her CIA colleagues at which point they discover that she's not what she appears to be. It turns out she's a Russian spy with links to Russian companies. How did they discover this? By simply searching their database!! Are we supposed to believe the CIA doesn't screen these people and know who they are inside and out?

Somehow, the KGB orchestrated a grandiose plan (taking some 30 years in the making) in which they train various assassins from childhood to assassinate an American president. This depends on Jolie escaping all sorts of impossible scenarios, taking out dozens of intelligence agents and police along the way. If landing unscathed on her back on a moving truck from a bridge wasn't enough for you, Jolie never gets hurt in the whole movie. Expert shooters also can never seem to connect from 10 feet away either. This movie takes the cake for most number of guys getting knocked unconscious for seemingly benign blows.

One of the more outrageous plot points was the Russian spy who ""leaks"" to the CIA that Lee Harvey Oswald was a Russian-trained spy. He reveals that it was Oswald who killed JFK. Of course, the CIA has no idea that the lone gunman theory is patently false.

At the end, the CIA is double-crossed by another agent they had no idea about! Apparently, anyone can lie to the CIA and they are none the wiser.

Too many plot holes to get into coupled with Jolie as the terribly cast double-agent.  I could write a list of 20 or 30 unbelievable points in this movie, but suffice it to say, spend your money on a real conspiracy/action movie.",1293494400,16,1944,4.650145772594752

UPDATE (12-29-10)
Since reviewing, I have had the chance to watch the two alternate versions.

While the Director's Cut provides probably the eeriest ending, in my opinion, the Extended Cut is the best of the three. Without giving anything away, it provides what is, for the story and the movie, the most realistic ending considering all else that happens. The characters behave in the most believable way (once again, for the story and the type of movie that it is).

The Director's Cut is my second favorite of the three, simply because the ending is quite eerie and ominous.

3839216,3,B0021L8V0W,"REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY EDITION ONLY:

I'll be honest when I first saw ""Salt"" I was a bit underwhelmed because frankly the trailer set me up for a different thriller.  Sure some (or most depending on how well you know the thriller genre)of the twists in ""Salt"" are clever but what makes ""Salt"" a step above most mediocre thrillers is how the director unfolds his story. ""Salt"" is a good if predictable film where some of the cliches of the genre are turned inside out. ""Salt"" plays as a cross between ""No Way Out"" (itself a remake of ""Out of the Past"") and the Bourne movies and, although not as good as those films, manages to be an entertaining thrill ride with plenty of action so you don't really notice some of the holes in the plot until after the movie is over.

Image quality is exceptionally crisp without being over process. The lossless audio sounds exceptional and is immersive. We get subtitles with this as well.

SPOILERS BELOW:

Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt a CIA agent who suddenly finds herself being hunted when a rogue Soviet spy master named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski)shows up and states that she is a Soviet spy and is there to kill the Russian President who will be attending the funeral of the Vice President of the United States. While Salt denies that she is a Soviet spy everything including the fact that she goes on the run indicates to her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schrieber) and Counter Intelligence Agent Peabody (Chiewetel Ejiofor)that she is, indeed, a Soviet spy who has been living and working undercover for most of her life. Salt claims she has gone on the run because whenever a spy's cover is blown their entire family is taken out and she's concerned that the only person in her life her husband will be assassinated.

END OF SPOILERS:

Directed by veteran thriller director Phillip Noyce (""Clear and Present Danger"", ""The Quiet American"", ""Rabbit Proof Fence"") and written by Kurt Wimmer (""Law Abiding Citizen"", ""Street Kings"")""Salt"" plays with the expectations of the thriller genre with both Noyce and Wimmer knowing use the twists and turns of other films. What really sells ""Salt"" though are the performances and the stunts in the film as well as the ingenious flashback story that is integrated into the main film revealing almost everything about Salt well before the midway point of the movie. While these attributes don't save the movie entirely, it does make the film diverting and entertaining.

There are some gaps in logic/the narrative but these are pretty easy to over look because you end up if you become involved in the movie. The ending which sets up a sequel wasn't quite as conclusive as it should have been as they could easily have left it open on the theatrical version but given us a bit more closure for the audience. Most films that leave an opening this large just don't work and it is a major Achille's heel for ""Salt"".

You can watch the ""Director's Cut"" an ""Unedited Version"" or the theatrical cut of the film with the Blu-ray. You should note that the story unfolds and is resolved in a slightly different fashion with the ""Director's Cut"" rather than the theatrical cut. As to which one you enjoy most, it'll, again, depend on your expectations of the movie but most of the changes are fairly cosmetic (i.e., don't add or subtract from the overall impact of the film).

There's also featurettes on the production of the movie as well as Noyce providing a commentary track that is quite interesting particularly when it comes to the decisions for the editing decisions made for the film.

If you set your expectations aisde set up from the preview trailer, ""Salt"" is an enjoyable action flick (of course it has little to do with reality but when was the last time you saw an action flick that DID have something to do with reality) and you might want to give it a chance to ""prove"" it's case.",1293062400,,3860,4.678466076696165

Jolie is at her best with the female action role, and the supporting actors do a great job. I know very little with direction/directors, so I cannot judge that very well.

3839262,5,B0021L8V0W,"Move over James Bond!  Stand aside Jason Bourne! Welcome Evelyn Salt.

If there is one formula in Hollywood that seems to work, that is having actress Angelina Jolie as your action star. The actress has appeared in several action-based films such as the ""Tomb Raider"" films, ""Wanted"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" and her films continue to be box office hits but her role as Evelyn Salt may just be what Hollywood has been wanting and needing, a femme fatale, a spy who literally kicks ass!  And there is no doubt about it, Evelyn Salt kicks ass and the potential of her character is fantastic.

In 2010, Jolie's spy thriller ""SALT"" became another dominating hit film in the box office for the actresss raking in over $293 million worldwide and now the Blu-ray and DVD release of ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"" will be released courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on December 21st.  And for those who love the film, will enjoy more of Evelyn Salt as you get three different versions of the film.

""SALT"" is directed by Phillip Noyce (""The Patriot Games"", ""Clear and Present Danger"", ""The Bone Collector"") and features a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer (""The Thomas Crown Affair"", ""Law Abiding Citizen"", ""Ultraviolet""), music by James Newton Howard (""The Dark Knight"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Fugitive"") and cinematography by Robert Elswith (""Duplicity"", ""There Will Be Blood"", ""Michael Clayton"" and ""Boogie Nights"").

""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"" comes with three different versions of the film.  While there will be two DVD releases of the film, one with the original theatrical edition and the other with a director's cut and extended edition.

As for the Blu-ray release of ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"", It is important to note that there are three different versions of the film.  The original theatrical edition and the extended edition are literally two different films in which the story of both films tend to go on different paths right after Evelyn meets up with Orlov.

The director's cut has a few slight modifications to the original theatrical edition with a voice over that changes the ending of the original theatrical version of the film.  So, in essence, each of the three versions of ""SALT"" have a different ending.

VIDEO:

""SALT"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The picture quality of ""SALT"" is absolutely fantastic.  ""SALT"" is a film that looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.  The colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and plenty of detail galore.  The cinematography by Robert Elswit combined with the visual effects really make ""SALT"" look realistic.  From the scenes on the White House lawn to the visual effects to make New York look lively from high above to the detail of Angelina Jolie's hair and her teary eyes.

I didn't detect any blurriness, compression artifacts, banding...no visual blemishes at all.  ""SALT"" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""SALT"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English - Audio Description Track Dolby Surround English Stereo.  Because this is an action film, you can expect a solid lossless 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack.  From crowd ambiance, glass shattering, cars crashing into each other, bullets hitting metal,  bullets zipping to trains on the tracks and many instances of things blowing up, there is a good amount of sound being diverted to the surround channels and just enough LFE that makes ""SALT"" really envelop the soundscape in your viewing area.

There is not one scene that I can say this is where the best sound is because these action sequences are so frequent and numerous that you can expect an active soundtrack throughout the film.

Dialogue is crystal clear, as with the music soundtrack coming from the front and center channels.  ""SALT"" features a wonderful lossless soundtrack that compliments its wonderful picture quality.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A pulse-pounding, spy thriller with twists and turns from beginning to end, Angelina Jolie absolutely embodies the new line of action hero stars like Bond and Bourne.  ""SALT"" was an awesome film and on Blu-ray, it's even better because you get three versions of the film.

But there is so much that I loved about the film.  For one, it was great to see a female heroine (or is she a villain?) and Angelina Jolie did a magnificent job!  According to director Phillip Noyce, Jolie wanted a Bond-like character and simply, the character of Evelyn Salt fit perfectly.  Also, a wonderful job by actors Liev Schreiber, Chiewetel Ejiofor and Daniel Olbrychski.  But it's hard to talk about these characters without spoiling the film, also its even more difficult to even talk about the original theatrical version of the film now that the Blu-ray release has these different versions.  And dare I say, the director's cut and the very different extended version were much better than the original.

So, I'm not going to even bother discussing what I liked about the original film as this is one of those rare moments for a Blu-ray review where the original theatrical edition may not mean as much as you may have a liking towards the other two versions of the films.  I have to admit that when I watched ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"", I figured that this release would have wonderful PQ and AQ, especially since it was an intense spy thriller with so many action scenes, that was a given.  But I was not expecting a film that would literally feature a different second half and become a whole new different story.  It was wonderfully done and to be truthful, I kind of wished that the extended version was the original theatrical version.  But still both this and the director's cut of the film were well-done and a major improvement over the original.

According to director Philip Noyce, the change of endings was the filmmaker trying to keep the focus of who is the ultimate villain to one character than the other.  He enjoyed both versions, I enjoyed both versions and I have no doubt that the viewers will too. Unlike other films which have various versions included on a Blu-ray disc. typically they don't exactly add much to the film but in the case of ""SALT"", these three different versions of the film included are quite substantial.  But for me, the extended version literally ends with a bang and has a memorable shot of Evelyn Salt.  A shame the extended version was not used for the theatrical version as it would have been a classic shot.

And just when you think you have watched all three films and that you are done, there is somewhat of a fourth way to watch the film in which you can watch the film but have a picture-in-picture segment on the making of ""SALT"". You also get audio commentary for each of the three films.

Granted, it's the same commentary but with additional commentary supporting those differing scenes or added footage.  You also get a good amount of special features, especially an interesting featurette by former spies from the CIA and KGB who talk about how life really was for a spy plus other featurettes such as radio interview, visual effects making of, disguises of Evelyn Salt and more.  And last, for the videophiles and audiophiles, ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"" is fantastic!  Awesome PQ and AQ to literally round out this magnificent Blu-ray release.

Overall, if you enjoyed ""SALT"", you're going to love ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"".  Such a refreshing character and I am hoping for a sequel!

Highly recommended!",1292976000,6,10883,4.8993985784581735

3839282,4,B0021L8V0W,"Ok, this is not a product review. I merely want to help you decide which version to buy.

For the first time ever, I personally prefer a theatrical edition over an unrated director's cut, and I'll tell you why. The version shown in theaters was more fun, and made a lot more sense. Unlike typical director's cuts, this one doesn't just add cut footage and tweek some of the editing, it actually uses alternate takes, with alternate events and outcomes, that fundamentally change the story. Simply put, without giving spoilers, the director's cut is far more bleak, and makes the idea of a sequel fairly pointless (or at least insurmountable). In fact, the alternate takes, if one looks back on them, invalidate the entire reason for the story in the first place, making it all a redundant waste of time. Again, trying to avoid spoilers here, so let me just make up a silly analogy that will convey the idea. Imagine a convoluted story about trying to, say, poison a city's water supply, and in the director's cut version you discover afterwards that the bad guys just happened to have someone planted who, by happenstance, already works at the water plant and could have poisoned the water at any time over a lunch break. Seriously, it's that sort of stupid.

I absolutely loved Salt when I saw it. It's a fantastic, exuberant movie that could easily be the start of a really enjoyable franchise. The director's cut, however, I did not enjoy. It did not add anything of substance beyond a few fairly insignificant scenes that were extended by a minute or two, and the alternate takes were far less satisfying than the originals, and only made the movie depressing and, honestly, rather stupid (and I'm far more partial to clever, intelligent stories that make sense). I truly believe that if you decide to go for the director's cut you'll be robbing yourself of seeing the vastly more logical and exciting story that was presented in the theatrical version.

My recommendation: Go for the original, and avoid the director's cut. The latter is not an expanded product, it's an alternate story, and a bad one at that.

Update: I've now had the chance to see the third version of this film (yes, a third unique version!), which I was unaware of when I wrote the above commentary. It's the ""extended"" version, and appears to only be available on the Blu-Ray disc. First off, unlike the Director's Cut, the Extended edition is actually a very good story. Some sequences are moved around or changed a bit, but this time it works, and the stupid elements have been removed (only one thing I disliked was retained, but at least in this version it had meaning). It also has a completely different final chapter, and I mean that in a big way, as in the story literally goes in a totally different direction, with new dialogue and scenes in other locations, etc.

My original recommendation still holds, but I'd like to sum-up the three versions in this way:

Theatrical: Overall best of the lot. Riveting story, exciting plot, lots of surprises and twists, and left wide-open for a sequel. (Also note that the sequel, which is already planned, will resume this version's storyline.)

Director's Cut: Unsatisfying. The alternate material is more morose, and undermines the inherent logic of the plot. Ruins any real chance of sequel making any sense by turning it from Die Hard into David and Goliath (and David's got a broken arm and is near-sighted --and Goliath has a Death Star). Worth watching eventually for novelty's sake, but in my opinion not for entertainment value. Prime candidate for Rifftrax.

Extended Edition: Very enjoyable. Combines most of the best elements of the Theatrical and Director's Cut, then slaps on a completely different ending. The style and sentiment seemed to be trying to emulate the neatly packaged, tidy spy stories of the '60s and '70s. This version ties the story up in a nice, neat bow of the instantly recognizable ""divine justice"" tradition (and you won't care, because it's just darned cool). This version is standalone and finite, with no hint at a sequel (and a sequel to this version would somewhat go against Salt's apparent wishes, but that's really all I can say without spoiling it for you). Definitely watch this version if you can get ahold of the Blu-Ray.

Ok, that's enough outta me on this subject. I promise, I won't edit this again. :)",1292112000,47,4381,4.792052980132451
3839283,5,B0021L8V0W,"There are 3 versions of Salt available for viewing, the Theatrical, Extended, and Director's Cuts.  They run 1:39:56, 1:40:58, and 1:43:59 respectively (credit to Interzone_Records for the correction).  Here are the major differences as compared to the base Theatrical Cut, e.g. Theatrical vs. Extended, and Extended vs. Director's Cut.  Note, SPOILERS follow below, so read at your own risk.  There are a few major, significant differences between the versions.

The Director's Cut makes the most sense plot-wise, and includes some better character development, in my opinion.

THEATRICAL vs. DIRECTOR's CUT
*****************************************************
1)  Evelyn Salt's opening interrogation scene in North Korea is longer and more brutal.  The soldiers force a tube down her throat and subject her to more intense questioning, followed by several kicks to the abdomen.

2)  Extended scene of Orlov training little kids who will be future sleeper agents.  As the kids finish a race through the woods, Orlov asks which kid was first, and which was last, whipping the last kid with a riding crop.

3)  Abduction of Michael (Salt's husband) by Orlov's thugs is shown.

4)  Additional scene where Michael tells Salt about a new species of spider that he has discovered.

5)  Childhood scene between Salt and Schnaider at Orlov's training camp.

6)  Salt's husband is NOT shot in the Director's Cut; rather, he is slowly drowned and Salt is forced to watch.  Michael's death is much more harrowing in the Director's Cut.

7)  Salt kills Orlov with a broken bottle, and the stabbing is shown in more detail, rather than off-screen.

8)  Salt's rampage through Orlov's freighter HQ is more graphic.

9)  Gunfights depict more bullet holes and blood, but nothing overly gory.

10) Winter kills the president in the Director's Cut, whereas in the Theatrical cut, Winter only knocks him unconscious.  I always thought the Theatrical cut never made much sense, because the President would easily be able to identify Winter as the traitor.

11)  At the end of the movie, there is a voiceover that subtly suggests that the vice president is actually one of Orlov's sleeper agents, setting the stage up for a sequel.  This voiceover is not present in the Extended Cut.

EXTENDED CUT vs. DIRECTOR's CUT
*****************************************************
1)  The changes listed above in the Director's Cut are also done in the Extended Cut, with the exception of the differences below.

2)  The President is only knocked unconscious in the Theatrical Cut (and killed in the Director's Cut).  In the Extended Cut, Winter attempts to make his way towards the unconscious President, who is being wheeled away on a stretcher, in order to kill him.

3)  The biggest difference in the Extended Cut is that Salt doesn't kill Orlov until the end of the movie.  So the entire sequence in the Theatrical and Director's Cuts where Salt annihilates Orlov's thugs on the barge is missing.

At the end of the Extended Cut, she is being interrogated by Peabody, where she fakes suicide and is taken to a hospital.  She subsequently escapes from the hospital, finds Orlov (back in Russia somewhere), and kills him.",1291766400,793,3196,5.152046783625731
3839284,1,B0021L8V0W,"When in history did they ever make movies with one man going about the country and gunning down bad women?  These movies are sexist and I just hope the people who enjoy this trash do not believe in it.  I cannot even mention to anyone that I hate these sexist films to anyone because for some reason this makes me a male chauvinist pig.  I will never understand why because I do know that there are some movies that were released on the theaters but were never released on VHS or DVD.

These films are fantasy and a real insult to men.  Someday this may all have an effect or it may not.  I do not care.  When they start making movies with bad women being gun down by a hero and then they are release on DVD or Blu-ray then maybe things are changing back to reality.",1291507200,11,766,4.135135135135135
3839285,4,B0021L8V0W,"You would think that having a beautiful, 28 year-old Russian woman caught by the FBI for spying for mother Russia would be the ultimate movie stunt for the release of Angelina Jolie's new film ""Salt."" But the arrest of stunning Anna Chapman was a mere coincidence rolled into a Movie Studio's dream.

But unfortunately, it takes more than that to make a film a big hit. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA operative living in the Washington D.C. On what seems to be an average day, Evelyn's life is turned upside down when a Russian agent defects and declares that Evelyn is a Russian spy poised to kill the visiting Russian President. The rest of the film is one action sequence after another, and Evelyn's devotion to her country seems to be at risk.

What ""Salt,"" loses on most though is an audience eager for such a release. For the best comparison, ""Salt,"" is a movie depiction of a comic book character without the advantage of having the comic book world anxious to see its story brought to film. Many of the scenes are outlandishly laughable, yet do we laugh when Batman dons his cape or when Superman flies in the air? No, of course not, these stories have been in our culture for years and Evelyn Salt is yet an infant in comparison.

Angelina Jolie does a great job as the central figure and Liev Schreiber continues to prove himself as Salt's CIA partner. If you are eager to see a film with a lot of action with a good cast, this is a great two hour diversion. And if you give it a try, you might find that Evelyn Salt is a character comparable to other comic icons like Wonder Woman, yet with a distinctive flavor of her own.

Apparently, Salt's father was a powerful wrestler and her mother a chessmaster. Hence she has inherited her fighting skills and strategic capabilities from them.

In this film, Salt is more resourceful than MacGyver, can escape lockdowns better than David Copperfield and can jump moving vehicles better than Morpheus (in Matrix 2).

- Stereotypes:  Russians, CIA operatives, politicians - you name it and they are stereotyped in this movie.  Absolutely nothing new, original, professional or fleshed out.  Absolutely no character development.

- Plot:  I was expecting to spend at least part of the movie wondering ""which side is she on?""  That never happens.  Plot holes are huge and distracting.  Easily spotted plot turns with a final 'twist' that is so telegraphed that it doesn't come as a surprise at all.  The ending screams 'sequel'.

- Acting:  Honestly - if Megan Fox had been in this instead of Angelina Jolie, people would be ripping it apart.  Somehow, Jolie seems to get a free pass and brings 'controlled depth' and 'icy calm' to the character when I saw it more as 'sleepwalking through a role'.

- Production values:  jerky camera work and convoluted camera angles that don't really capture the action as much as give you a headache when trying to follow it.

Overall, the only positive thing is that at least it wasn't a long movie.  I guess if you don't do any character development and rely on stereotypes then you don't have to spend a lot of time on it.  Just patch together a bunch of bad action scenes.",1288656000,38,1414,4.647773279352227

I just had to see this movie as I have been thoroughly impressed by Angelina Jolie and her humanitarian work around the world.  Action movies are not my thing but I wanted to support her work.  As Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; she gives a large part of her earnings to causes in the East, African nations and even in the Caribbean as she did for Haiti. She is concerned for the impoverished and needy children and as they benefit from her work, I wanted to be a part of that giving by paying to see her act.
May she continue to set this great example to other movie makers and celebrities worldwide.

STARRING: Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl, Daniel Pearce and Hunt Block

WRITTEN BY: Kurt Wimmer

DIRECTED BY: Phillip Noyce

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Action / Thriller
Release Date: 23 July 2010
Review Date: 30 August 2010

Sylvester Stallone's new film The Expendables, showcases several prototypes of characters from the `one guy goes in and kills everyone', movies from the 80s. I agree with Stallone in feeling that there is a shortage of these types of films in general, let alone descent ones; the last good one I can remember offhand, being The Punisher (2004).

Angelina Jolie has impressed me and no doubt Stallone as well, with her latest film Salt, where she shows that it doesn't take a man to walk into a room and kill everyone; she can do it too. And man, does she do it; with skill, style and sex appeal. Short of maybe Charlize Theron, no other actress could have pulled this role off.

She is Evelyn Salt. She's a spy for the CIA. Or is she? A dangerous looking Russian man walks himself into the CIA headquarters to report that a Russian Spy living in America, will assassinate the president of Russia, during his visit to the states. Ready for the kicker? The creepy Russian man leers at Evelyn from across the interview table and informs her that she is said Russian Spy / future assassin!

You can imagine the look of shock on the faces of her comrades, who are taping the interview from the next room; not to mention Evelyn's. Sadly, that's all I can divulge to you. Trust me, there's so much more to tell, that it's killing me not to - but you'll have to see it for yourself! Twist and turn after twist and turn. Some you may see coming, others you probably will not. Either way - you will have a blast watching her run for her life; the filmmakers leaving us in limbo as to whether we should be rooting for her or not.

The film is over the top, sure. At times it's even a tad irritating, having you sitting there going, `Oh, come on."" A knife being snuck into the CIA headquarters; unnoticed information on CIA agents' background checks; the Whitehouse being penetrated as easily as a few 17-year-olds sneaking into a frat party; leaps from helicopters and freeways and moving vehicles, and etc., etc. My personal favorite would be Jolie (to quote Woody, from Toy Story), ""falling with style"", down an elevator shaft, passing several floors with each jump, and grabbing onto a ledge just right each time. This is something they should have had her do in the Lara Croft movies, as it was done in the videogames; but they didn't, so never mind.

Speaking of videogames, Salt could make a very interesting one indeed and I wouldn't be surprised if the movie is followed by a sequel. Videogames? Sequels? `One girl killin' everyone?"" I know - sounds like it could be a too much, but the film works. It's very cleverly written and directed, and Jolie's butt kicking action scenes are matched evenly throughout the film, with dramatic ones sharing brilliant acting from her two co-stars, Live Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor.

Schreiber and Ejiofor both play CIA operatives that work with Salt, and are tasked with tracking her down when she has fled. Neither of them is entirely sure if they should trust her alleged innocence, as the film hurls them after her through suspenseful stimulated action chase scenes close to the flavor of those in The Fugitive and Enemy of the State.

Director Phillip Noyce and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer know this genre like the back of their hand and the film proves it. A list of their best achievements would be unrelenting; but a short version between the two of them could include Law Abiding Citizen, Street Kings, The Bone Collector, Patriot Games and The Saint.

In closing, having enjoyed the film a great deal, but also having pointed out how un-plausible some of the events were, I feel the need to defend it one last time. I can say that I have definitely seen action films that have pushed the envelope of believability a lot further than Salt, and offered us only phony acting in return to justify their means. At least most of the elements in this film could maybe happen; and the performances of the actors, only add believability to us finding those things being possible.",1284595200,3,4292,4.676392572944297
3839363,4,B0021L8V0W,"Salt is your run-of-the-mill summer action movie with a twisted story akin to The Bourne series or James Bond  of old. Like those movies the action is over the top and crazy, guns blaze and sparks fly but the PG-13 rating spares us the blood and guts that should accompany such wicked projectiles. One scene has Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie)  killing a guy by ramming the jagged end of a broken bottle into his neck but this is left to your imagination since all we see is the motion and then the discarded bloody bottle after the fact. Am I the only one who prefers his action graphic and R-rated? Still Salt was highly likable and the liking goes beyond the beauty at the helm.

The plot of Salt is not easily summarized without offering up spoilers so I cannot go there. I will say however that it involve the CIA, a super-spy named Evelyn Salt, her fellow spy Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and a plot involving Russia, North Korea and terrorism. Angelina Jolie does her thing as Evelyn Salt, with the action looking very much like she did the stunts herself (which she did). Speaking of stunts, unlike the Bourne series, the fighting and action in Salt was done extremely well. When Evelyn fought bigger guys she would use objects and moves that made sense for a smaller woman. I have grown tired of seeing small, slight women throwing roundhouses, jabs and fancy moves to drop big 300lb muscle men in action films. Salt takes guys out by kicks to the groin, trapping the knee, breaking bottles across their faces and choking them out with chains. If anything, this really impressed me with the action.

What I didn't like about the action was the tired, incorrect and convenient knockouts that occurred when people got beat up. Movies tend to lean on this to discard bad guys who they don't want to have the hero kill. The hero will punch baddies in the gut and step on their hand and they will lie on the ground knocked out no matter where they were hit. Salt did a good job on the choreography but guys were getting knocked out from subtle blows and it really bothered me that they took this route. Film quality fluctuates at times especially during the traffic scenes but it isn't enough to distract the viewer from the scenes that are playing out.

Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Peabody and is a strong presence as he always - which leads me to wonder when he will headline his own picture. Salt starts out a bit uninteresting and scarily bland until 30 minutes in then it turns into a bullet train ride of action. Angelina is a Jack of all Trades in the acting profession having played the tender damsel and the hardcore action heroine. I believe that after Tomb Raider, Angie was bitten by the action bug and not only loves playing the femme fatales but does a damn good job at it too.

Grab Salt if you are an action fan!",1283904000,5,2826,4.488326848249027
3839364,4,B0021L8V0W,"Director Philip Noyce and star Angelina Jolie, the pair who gave us a thriller ""The Bone Collector"" back in 1999, team up again for ""Salt,"" action thriller about Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent on the run, accused of being a Russian spy. To make my review short and not to spoil anything about the film, I can only say is that the fast-paced and action-packed thriller, penned by Kurt Wimmer (""The Recruit""), keeps you guessing until the end, though you may notice lots of plot holes when you leave the theater, or even before.

This is not to say the film is bad. ""Salt"" delivers goods with Angelina Jolie as the titular character, who remains a mystery from the very start (the film begins with a sequence set in North Korea, slightly reminiscent of one James Bond film). In fact some parts of the film remind us of James Bond or Jason Bourne films, but Jolie lends energy (if not credibility) to the convoluted storyline, which looks sometimes dated with the heroine's back story and these inevitable ""villains."" Or maybe we should call it old-fashioned.

""Salt"" is mindless fun with lots of actions. The action set-pieces including chases and shoot-outs are all well-done though some of them stretch credibility to the point where Salt looks almost superhuman (never afraid of ricocheting bullets). But Bond and Bourne are also superhuman, so why not Evelyn Salt?",1281830400,,1360,4.8076923076923075

3839367,3,B0021L8V0W,"""Salt"" is a film that was bashed by film critics, because it's an action film. Once again however, this action film is not as bad as the critics say it is.

The basic plot for ""Salt"" is focused on character Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) who is a CIA agent. One day while interrogating a Russian defector, he tells her that a person by the name of Salt is going to assassinate the Russian president. In hearing this, the CIA decides to keep Salt in the interrogation room, to ask her some questions. She decides to run away which begs the question, is she a spy?

Angelina Jolie is the kind of actor where if she has a good script to follow like ""Changeling"" directed by Clint Eastwood, she is very good. ""Salt"" has a good plot, in which Angelina shines.",1280880000,6,752,4.364285714285714
3839368,5,B0021L8V0W,"Angelina Jolie's acting has often been overshadowed by her marriage. Anyone who has viewed Changeling or Girl, interrupted, has obviously witnessed her great range in different and equally challenging roles. However, at the end of the day, she and her husband are viewed as mere celebrities-not different than reality stars-than serious actors. She has long affirmed her place among the great actresses of the last decade, but her public persona has often overshadowed her career. Salt is proof that even in the Hollywood blockbuster, she is as versatile as one can be.

In the beginning of the film, we view CIA agent Evelyn Salt, played by Jolie, being tortured by North Korean authorities. Due to a miraculous trade between the Americans and North Koreans, she is freed to return home. Not long after her arrival in her country, she comes in contact with a Russian defector who informs of a deadly operation named ""Day: X."" Planned since the onset of the Cold War, the execution of this plan will mean the end of the United States. Possibly indicative of its execution is his testament that the Russian President will die at the funeral of the American Vice-President. Salt is a throwback to those classic films, notably The Manchurian Candidate, which focused on the conflicts and animosity between the two countries. This film may seem quite dated, as the cold war and the most notable of the two nation's conflicts seems to have ended, but it focuses on current times and events, implicating that the animosity of many Russians have yet to end. They are still training operatives, from childhood, and releasing them within the United States and awaiting the best time to take action.

Fortunately, this ""Day: X"" does not seem to be under the control of the Russian authorities, but old men of the Cold War era who want to put an end to the US. As politically correct as possible, the film avoids introducing the motives behind ""Day: X."" Is this a war against democracy, the current US president, or generally do these men enjoy seeing this superpower feel threatened for a change? Such claims are never addressed, keeping the film quite light in ideology and philosophy. For the sake of argument, let's suppose the mastermind of the plan simply hates all that is American about the US and needs to wipe this country of the map to rest easily. The film is Hollywood entertainment that simply wants to suppose that America has enemies for some very vague and unknown reasons, despite its efforts to spread ""peace"" across the globe.

The film will invariably will be compared to the Manchurian Candidate for its countless twists. That classic film is obviously of enormous social and historical importance, but both are fascinatingly deceptive in toying around with the audience's perception of the main characters. For some time, Salt shows infinite amount of courage in alienating its American audience by showcasing the success of the Russians in causing havoc in the United States; some may even see parts of the film, before the major revelation as hugely anti-American. Seeing this in a packed theater, I did sense some anger or tension from fellow viewers. It was the unbelievable sense of betrayal from a film that took pleasure in lambasting and lampooning the secret service, or the ease by which the Russians were able to overcome all the security barriers and harm such powerful diplomats. Of course, Hollywood would never want to cause a stir by showing an incident that may mirror 9/11, and display a more wide scale target and tragedy. No, that would be thoughtful and somewhat depressive, and studios have a strong disdain for portraying the foreseeable, yet unfortunate, future-they would rather fill our heads with countless post apocalyptic junk. Sure, the film eventually loses its fire in relation to its intriguing post-cold war analysis of the relation between these two nations, but for a blockbuster even such an attempt is admirable. Salt does not have an actual agenda in regards to the relations of Russia and US at present, but it cleverly uses the elements of the old cold war films, many which were propaganda products, to tell its tale. If the film actually had been faithful to its vision, it would have initiated an abundant amount of controversy for this film; controversy that really would not aid the film in any shape or form.

The real loser, overall, is Tom Cruise who lost the role to Jolie-as it was later rewritten for her. Choosing Jolie was a wise move, considering that a female character more successfully balances out the tension and anger of the media and the appreciation of her Russian comrades. A female character can convey better her loyalty and betrayal for each side, without seeming as sinister and excessively callous. Jolie really deserves more challenging role, such as those which Kate Winslet seems to always attain, but she still gives a dedicated performance. It is quite bewildering that we feel sorry for her misfortunes, but later grow to dislike her as her true colors begin to show. She picks exactly the right tone for her performance, caring, emotional, and superficially honest. Jolie brings the unexpected masculinity to the film that is quite unexpected of her. Such films are often reserved for butch male actors, and often bodybuilders, such as Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Jean Claude Van Damme, but Jolie proves that actresses can bring much needed likeability and vulnerability to the role. Salt eventually lags near the ending-in regards to the realism of its Russian-US relations and the outcome of Evelyn's crimes and their belated revelation-but considering its conception as a Hollywood blockbuster, it is surprisingly fresh and a winner.",1280880000,9,5740,5.0010460251046025
3839369,4,B0021L8V0W,"One thing you can count on: When Angelina Jolie does an action movie, you know you're going to get action and plenty of it.  The action in ""Salt"" is so non-stop, so relentless, so slam-bang-in-your-face, that the film moves at warp speed and it's over almost before you realize it.  That the plot is patently ridiculous somehow doesn't seem to matter very much.  This movie is meant to be pure fun, and on that score, it delivers.

Jolie plays Evelyn Salt (it's interesting that this role was originally written for a male actor, but Jolie proves she is more than able to handle it), a CIA operative married to a German scientist who specializes in all kinds of deadly spiders, who managed to get her out of a North Korean prison where she is being gruesomely tortured as the film opens.  But it turns out she may or may not be a Russian sleeper agent who is scheduled to go into action as soon as some very nasty stuff hits the fan; specifically, the assassinations of both the Russian and American presidents, and the detonation of a nuclear bomb or two.

Salt's cover is blown (maybe) and she protests she was set up, but since nobody believes her, she's off and running in some really exciting chase sequences.  Jolie actually did some of her own stunts in this movie, although not the more dangerous ones such as jumping from the top of one speeding truck to another.  The real fun in this film comes from the fact that we can't really tell who Salt is.  Is she an American agent, or Russian, or Russian pretending to be American, or American pretending to be Russian?  By the end of the film we still don't know, but we know one thing: the way this film ends, a sequel is probably already on the storyboards.

All of the actors give creditable performances, but Jolie's performance is what really makes you want to see this film more than once.  Tabloid gossip aside, she's a damn good actress, and she totally throws herself into this movie, literally and figuratively.  Tune in next summer (hopefully) for the next exciting episode.

I just watched the DVD with all three versions of the film (theatrical release, director's cut and extended cut), and am wondering why in the world didn't the studio release the extended cut in the theaters?  It's a totally different ending, which I'm darned if I'm giving away, except to say that it's much more satisfying and makes for a vastly better movie overall.

You can choose your version simply by going to the DVD menu, click on Play Movie, and then select whichever of the three you want.  The extended cut of this movie is the one to watch.

3839391,4,B0021L8V0W,"As the movie ""Salt"" opens, CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angela Jolie) is being tortured in a North Korean prison.  Fortunately, her CIA boss (played with marvellous deadpan charm by Liev Schrieber) manages to make a trade to get her home safely to her German boyfriend.

The storyline jumps ahead two years.  Salt is married to her boyfriend and working at an unadvertised CIA location.  A walk-in Russian defector named Orlov claims that a group of former Soviet deep cover agents, the KA program, has been activated to kill the Russian President when he arrives in New York City.  under interrogation by the skeptical Salt, Orlov turns everything upside down by naming her as a KA agent.  Salt panics and goes on the run, dodging the pursuing CIA with daring improvisions and scary quick martial arts skills.  Salt will go first to her husband, then to the defector Orlov, before pressing on to New York City and the assassination plot.  Neither Salt nor her opponents nor even the assassination plot are who they seem to be.

The non-stop action and Evelyn Salt's Jason Bourne-like sense of cool will help the audience get past some significat plot holes to a Mission: Impossible-type ending.  Recommended as an exciting spy thriller.",1280620800,,1231,4.903381642512077
3839392,3,B0021L8V0W,"If one female can bring in the summer action fare, it's Angelina Jolie. 2 years ago we got ""Wanted"", where she played the smokin' hot Fox (her name certainly is right), the smart and super-tattooed female who leads poor, depressed Wesley to a clan of assassins called The Fraternity. Now 2 years later, she returns with ""Salt"", which, as you could tell from the trailer, is your typical summer action flick. So if you're expecting anything deep like ""Inception"", do be prepared to be disappointed. But if you're like me, asking for just a summer action flick, then you'll be satisfied.

Evelyn Salt works in a cubicle in a CIA-owned office building. It's her anniversary day, and she is trying to figure out a perfect way to hold her anniversary dinner with her arachnid-fascinated husband Mike. She is called to interrogate a mysterious Russian man when she finds herself in two troublesome situations: 1) Rumor is spreading that she is working with Russian Intelligence and 2) In 24 hours, the Russian president will be assassinated by a Russian spy upon giving a Eulogy at the Vice President of the USA's funeral. She must prove her innocence from this accusation, as well as stop this spy from assassinating the Russian president.

So yeah, a typical summer fare plot. Obviously you know that half the movie will just be Angelina beating guys up, and this film does not disappoint in that aspect. Action-wise, this film has some great action scenes, including a particularly exciting car chase that involves Angelina jumping from truck to truck. Her stunt work is quite impressive too, and it has some of her best stunts she's performed since the Tomb Raider movies. She is in great shape evidently, and so therefore her action scene work is quite fun to watch. Acting wise, she really can act, and she shows it well enough here.

So yeah, it's fun and all. Good twist near the end makes it worth it as well. So why 2.5 stars? Because really, this film is like a fast food hamburger. Enjoyable while consumed, yet after, you're left with a lingering stomach ache. After the film, you're left wondering why you watched it, just like after you finish eating a fast food burger, you're left wondering why you ate it, despite the enjoyment you got out of it.

In short, It's worth it while it lasts, and that's mainly it.",1280534400,5,2321,4.723456790123457
3839393,4,B0021L8V0W,"Angelina looks like a bag of bones in this movie, very skinny, unnaturally so. It is painful to look at her arms, and legs, she looks so weak. In light of that her physical prowess is hard to accept. She looked so much better in Mrs. Smith. She needs to gain about 10-15 pounds if we are to take her seriously as a action movie star.
The movie itself is typical action flick, fun, mindless entertainment, pure and simple.",1280275200,,421,4.341772151898734
3839394,3,B0021L8V0W,"For some reason, I didn't like this movie as well as I thought I would. The character of Salt changes her personality and looks three times, and I couldn't tell what she was supposed to be, because the movie is pretty confusing. In the beginning, she seems like a damsel in distress, and then later she turns into an action star. While interrogating a Russian defector, he mentions that Evelyn Salt is a Russian spy. The CIA believe it to be true, so she escapes and tries to find her husband to make sure he's safe. During the Vice President's funeral, the Russian President will be assassinated unless Salt can stop it. If you like action movies, you might like SALT!!!",1280275200,,671,4.553719008264463
3839395,3,B0021L8V0W,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Salt"" starring Angelina Jolie. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. I watched the director's cut. Well, it was one of these fast-moving, high-action, violent movies with little depth of thought. It's also one of these post-cold war movies where  Russia and America are still locked into the mutual destruction thing. Yaawwwnnnn!

Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, supposedly and American girl who's parents were killed in a Russian car wreck. She returned to America and eventually worked her way into high levels of the CIA. But wait, she was originally brainwashed (trained) to be a sleeper agent for Russia and was awakened in the US by the capture of her trainer during a questioning period. Well, she then reverted back to her Russian training and become a potential assassinator of the president of the US. Well, this story had more twists and turns than the Mississippi River and I just lost interest in this bizarre  and impossible fantasy spy adventure. It's a high adventure action flick and some of the stunts are really amazing and will hold your attention. Likewise, there's a lot of bullets flying, death and destruction. Jolie plays a one-wonan destruction crew, and not too convincingly. It's an interesting twist, however.

The movie is hard for me to rate. The story/script is nonsense. The acting is reasonably good. The sets and stunts are spectacular. It held my attention and was good entertainment. Would I watch it again? No.",1280188800,,1488,5.012145748987854
3839396,2,B0021L8V0W,"At first glance, Salt  looked like it had a lot of potential to deliver a thriller that utilized both pulse racing action and a strong female lead. However, it's unfortunate that that's all the film really was. Other than Angelina Jolie beating the snot out of men twice her size for an hour and a half, the film offered little else.

It makes sense that children who are trained to be Russian spies while they're young would be capable of doing extraordinary things that the average human being wouldn't be able to, but Salt seemed borderline superhuman at times. The ability to handle various firearms and making homemade bombs out of cleaning supplies is one thing, but climbing around skyscrapers and bouncing off the walls like Spider-Man seemed like a bit of a stretch. The way she'd steal things as she was passing by came off as more of an unlikely repeated occurrence of both luck and convenience rather than a skillful attribute.

The storyline is also ridiculously outlandish. It includes such gems as Lee Harvey Oswald actually being a Russian spy named Alek and a rather predictable plot twist in the climax. One of the weakest parts of the film is how inconclusive Salt's motifs come off as. The film was probably trying to keep you guessing as to whether or not Salt was actually a spy up until the big reveal, but her actions appear more confusing than anything and are relatively unclear until the end. Then her reasoning behind her actions just seemed so one-dimensional and dull that you wonder why you even bothered to watch this thriller to begin with. Not to mention that the film has a bigger open-ending than Predators did earlier this year.

Salt does deliver some fast paced, bone crunching action and features an incredibly strong female lead, but its preposterous and predictable storyline drags it down. Salt is way too similar to everything else Angelina Jolie has done to go out of your way and see. The bottom line is the film treads familiar ground that you've already seen before and has probably been done better. If you're dead set on seeing Salt, I strongly encourage you to wait until it hits DVD and Blu-ray. Otherwise, skip it altogether.",1280102400,15,2178,4.753968253968254
3839397,4,B0021L8V0W,"This is probably as amusing as the so-called summer genre of action movies can get. Don't take it serious, don't worry too much about plausibility, just go with the flow.
The film has two legs: crazy, stunt-driven, violent, spectacular action, and a classical spy - counter spy puzzle. Who is working for whom, who are the good guys and who the bad ones, is there a difference anyway?
Jolie's character (?) Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent, married to a German arachnologist in Washington. She gets exposed by a former Soviet spy master as a Soviet sleeper agent, planted in the 1980s together with dozens of others, to cause havoc in the US at a yet to be determined time. The time has come. Assassinations of the visiting Russian President and then of the American President are on the agenda. Plus a nuclear attack on some targets.
For most of the time we wonder if she is a Soviet spy or an American spy posing as a Soviet spy or a Soviet spy posing as an American spy posing as a Soviet spy. You know, the Escher thing.
A sequel is guaranteed.",1280016000,3,1042,4.432291666666667
3839398,5,B0021L8V0W,"This is a really well done action flick worth viewing. Here's what's good with it:

1. It's full of non-stop action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The stunts and fight scenes are really exciting.

2. The story has twisty turns and it keeps you thinking. There's no boredom here, and I felt the plot was close enough to being plausible to keep you interested. Even if the exact program of placing trained children into America isn't complete realism, we all know that there are spies living as Americans in this country. Just watch the news. It's a current and relevant theme.

3. The acting is excellent, and the characters, especially Angelina Jolie, show depth. You can't help caring about what happens to Salt.

While I agree with another reviewer who said that Salt's husband isn't shown a lot, I felt he was shown enough to reveal that Salt really loved him. That was what the audience needed to know in order to understand her motives, and to care about whether he lived or died.

I'd definitely recommend seeing this movie, and it's one I'd own as well.",1280016000,170,1074,4.572916666666667
3839399,5,B0021L8V0W,"This was a great movie!  Almost non-stop action--car chases, run from the CIA, lots of shooting and fighting, and a few twists and turns.

Evelyn Salt is a CIA intelligence officer.  She is married to a German National who has easy access to move freely, in and out of Korea.  She is about to go home to celebrate her wedding anniversary when a Russian defector shows up at the office, telling a story.  He says he is dying of cancer and has nothing to lose.  He explains that many years ago, the Russians developed a plot to ruin America, the ""KA"" program (""kill America"", I guess).  They trained many, many children and then substituted them into American life as ""sleepers"", to participate in a well-orchestrated plot at a much later time.  When the time is right, these children would be activated.  The one assigned to kill the Russian president was Evelyn Salt!

As Evelyn is interrogating the defector, the other agents are running a body scan on him which indicates he is telling the truth.  Uh oh.  They begin to look at Evelyn a little differently.  Meanwhile, she is concerned about her husband's safety and takes off to find him.  This begins Evelyn's chase and a ton of action.

Is ""our"" Evelyn Salt really Agent Chenkov?  Or is someone setting her up?  Watch and see.  I think you will really enjoy this movie if you like action.

BTW--Yes, there is a lot of BS in the chase scenes, where Evelyn would likely have been killed in real life many times over, BUT, that's what makes a movie fun!  They get up and keep on going--they are the ONE person in the whole world who could survive or could achieve something.  Get real--that's what you go to see--the so-called impossible stuff! Angelina does a great job in this high-action flick!",1279929600,58,1749,4.5954692556634305
