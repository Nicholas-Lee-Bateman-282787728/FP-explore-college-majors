I don't know much about this director, but whoever he ishuge thank you! I bet you it's not thought well of in Russia, which is probably painful. But they're too busy american s***ty films, Hollywood  crap which we feed them unfortunately. I am not big fan of SF or Strugazky brothers, but this film is worth every minute of it!",1465257600,,472,4.292134831460674
