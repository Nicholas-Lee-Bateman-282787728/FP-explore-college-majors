8749301,1,B00CDZM864,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. This is an extremely amateur production; haphazardly thrown together with a weak sense of chronology and often a dreadfully inane commentary by miscellaneous Joe Blogs characters on one of the worlds greatest ever bands. Bill Ward barely gets a mention on the first disk, which despite calling itself ""the halcyon years"" never even discusses to any length the Polka Tulk Blues band nor of Earth's early materials. You can also find most of the Tony Iommi interviews contained here on Youtube unedited. Much of the live band footage on this is stretched and looks terrible; I have much of it in better quality on VHS from the ""Black Sabbath Story Volume 1&2"" which I would direct the uninitiated towards in the wake of this awful junk. It should be reinforced that this release is completely unofficial and that the band in no way endorses it. I'm still waiting for a quality DVD release of the famous 1970 Beat Club performances - as it is sadly, I'll have to stick to my worn VHS editions! Avoid this terribly made fan-cash in at all costs unless like me, you're a Sabbath die-hard and can't help but check and see if there's anything here you didn't already know.",1486080000,,1209,4.7075471698113205
