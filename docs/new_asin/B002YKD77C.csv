4013261,5,B002YKD77C,"Norman Reedus as ""Mac""!!!!!! Not a fabulous movie but worth a look and definitely if you're a fan. Happy to have it in my collection.",1339113600,5,133,4.36
4013262,2,B002YKD77C,"I am a fan of the actor Norman Reedus which is why I bought this film in the first place. However even Norman could not save this film. This film is disturbing to say the least, and the ending is just sick. If you're a fan of Mr. Reedus rent Beat, Boondock Saints, or Beatnicks.",1321315200,13,278,4.072727272727272
4013263,4,B002YKD77C,The movie was ok.  It didn't answer everything at the end and was kind of weird.  The video itself was in great shape.,1318896000,,118,4.086956521739131
4013264,2,B002YKD77C,"<strong>Red Canyon</strong> (Giovanni Rodriguez, 2008)

You've seen this plot before (if you're me, you've even seen it in the last week): traumatized young thing Regina (<em>The Hottie and the Nottie</em>'s Christine Lakin) is brought by her brother Devon (<em>Swimming Upstream</em>'s Tim Draxl) back to the family homestead so they can sell the place, but it turns out that the traumatic event that made Regina go bats in the first place is waiting in the wings: it has something to do with Mac (<em>The Boondock Saints</em>' Norman Reedus), the local meth dealer, and she has to figure out what it is before (a) it happens again and/or (b) she goes nuts. (And if you can't figure out what it is from even that vague synopsis, then let me recommend you Laurie Halse Anderson's book <em>Speak</em>, where most of us figured out the EXACT SAME TWIST from reading the jacket copy.)

Even given that it's entirely predictable, it's not a total lost cause. Reedus plays a slimeball with aplomb, even when he's the good guy (viz. <em>Boondock Saints</em>), and his performance here is chilling. Lakin is better when she's imitating Barbara from <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>, but between her and Reedus, they almost pull the rest of the cast out of the crapper. Not quite, but almost. Sonnel Velazquez' cinematography is great when he's doing wide-open spaces, but he's got to work on the cramped cave shots. He's got a future in front of him, though.

Not a complete waste of time. **",1307664000,3,1486,4.888888888888889
4013265,1,B002YKD77C,"The only reason I watched this film, was because I am friends with one of the cast. Poor guy!!! This is a mess, no  wonder its never really been released and even the DVD is virtually impossible to buy anywhere apart from Amazon. (not necessarily a compliment guys)The gore and violence is laughably bad and the incestuous ending is deeply offensive and makes no sense at all. But none of the movie makes any sense. It also looks cheap and is poorly edited. Actors never really know how a movie is going to turn out, but did anyone read the script? The final scene ---yikes. !!!!!!!!",1289520000,8,583,4.5
4013266,1,B002YKD77C,"I made the mistake of reading the reviews and forum posts on this
title throughout the internet and believing them, what a sucker I am.

This film was awful, if they had spent half the effort making it as
they did flooding the internet with positive reviews it may have been
watchable. It was not shocking, it was not ""real"", it was incredibly
poor.

Here is an example of the ""amazing"" acting: Woman opens cupboard,
shotgun fall onto her making her fall onto the ground(it must be a very
heavy shotgun!!), the gun goes off inches from her head and she
causally says, "" I hate it here"". What!!! I have been unable to
find a single honest review on the internet of this film, unless you
really believe it is a 10/10 shockfest, the most amazing, sick,
romantic, gory, dramatic, life changing event of the century then I
suggest you stay away.",1283731200,8,840,4.483660130718954
4013267,3,B002YKD77C,"Red Canyon is a well-intentioned thriller that does present the viewer with an engaging plotline, plus quite a few twists in the allegiance of the main characters.  Even though the story is a blend from other films centered about backwoods and dysfunctional family misadventures, there is a definite momentum that is maintained by the numerous plot revelations.  Although the ending left something to be desired, the main factors keeping me from seeing this as a truly excellent movie were the cinematography and the editing.  Despite competent acting and mostly believable scene staging, too much of the movie had an unintentional amateur filmmaker feel to it.  Further, the editing was weak for this type of work, significantly diluting much of the shock value.  Not bad overall, and certainly worth a watch if you can find a reasonably-priced copy!",1275609600,7,851,5.182481751824818
4013268,5,B002YKD77C,"Red Canyon is one of the best horror films I've seen in ages.  It does have a lot of twists and turns and isn't a movie you want to watch when you're doing something else.  It's similar to ""Straw Dogs,"" Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"" and the thriller ""Angel Heart"".  It's also reminiscent of Asian horror.  The entire cast is very good and includes Norman Reedus from ""Boondock Saints,"" Justin Hartley from ""Smallville,"" Christine Lakin, ""Return to Witch Mountain,"" Noah Fliess from ""Brick"" and a really excellent new actor named Tim Draxl.

Red Canyon is a about a brother and sister who return to sale their mother's property years after surviving a brutal attack in the small town.  It soon becomes clear that the sister has only a fuzzy recollection of what happened to them and why.  In the beginning of the film her brother promises to tell her...but it becomes clear that he's twisted the truth to protect her from the worst of what happened that night.

It's a very tense film.  Very nerve wracking and will keep you guessing the whole way through.  I think this movie is going to be a collector's item one day.  While not every element of the movie works - it's unique, it's daring, and it isn't your run of the mill studio film.  You'll either love it - or possibly hate it - but no one is going to feel tepid about this one.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Canyon/dp/B002YKD77C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Canyon</a>",1263168000,6,1484,4.939516129032258
4013269,2,B002YKD77C,"What can I say about Red Canyon? Well, its a confusing mess. It does start off well though. The first 30 minutes of the movie are full of suspense, mystery, ominious scenery, and good acting. I was intrigued and wanted to learn about the bad guys and what transpired in the cave at the red canyon. Unfortunately, the rest of the story is told in brief blurry flashbacks which only serve to aggravate and further confuse the viewer. From what I could glean from the annoying flashbacks, the movie seems to end with a disturbing incestious twist but by that time I was too bored and annoyed to really care.",1262995200,5,604,4.5

8384261,5,B002YKD77C,"Some of these reviews are hilarious - yes, this is a disturbing movie, but in the best ways possible. The ""twist"" in the end is very weird, but after seeing the entire movie I must ask...why would it be anything else but weird and disturbing?! For those saying that it was poorly edited, sure there were some parts that were supposed to be intense and thrilling and I laughed, but thats because I was highly entertained. Let me just say this...if you squirm or get weireded out by parts of a movie...ANY MOVIE...and it makes you feel awkward or uncomfortable in a scene that IS awkward and uncomfortable then the actors did their jobs perfectly. Think about it...they made you feel EXACTLY what you were supposed to feel. I loved this movie - I would compare it to the same type of movie as Wrong Turn.",1467244800,,802,4.5

Leaves you with a  SURPRISE ending, You'd never expect! Not to mention, even though Norman is a psycho, he is one sexy ass one, well Imo!! Can't find it in the US! You can get it in the UK, for a good price, make sure your DVD player, PLAYS ALL REGIONS!! ENJOY!!",1426204800,,396,4.28
8384266,5,B002YKD77C,"This DVD is virtually impossible to find in the US and Canada but, I was able to wrangle a copy out of the UK and with the help of my brand new region free DVD player, I was finally able to watch it!

The credits are still rolling after my first viewing of this movie and I'm somewhat at a loss for words... I tracked it down because I'm a huge fan of Norman Reedus and let me tell you, I'm not disappointed! He is absolutely phenomenal as Mac! Seriously, making a drug cooking rapist with meth teeth sexy, one murder at a time. Absolutely amazing. If you're a fan of Norman Reedus, this is definitely a must-see! Naturally, I wish Mac had a larger role but, that's just my own personal bias...

As for the non-Norman aspects of the film, it was really creepy and disturbing. Like a tamed version of The Hills Have Eyes. And it definitely didn't have a happy ending. Personally, I like that in a movie. Too often you see the hero defeat the bad guy and save the girl and all is well, wrapped up nice and neat with a little bow right before the credits roll. It's a nice change of pace when a movie leaves you with your head spinning, your heart breaking and your jaw on the floor.",1385683200,3,1180,4.1938325991189425
8384267,2,B002YKD77C,"The premise of the movie is okay and heck even some of the actors are good..okay only two of them are good, but it's the ending that really ruins the movie for me. It's a twist you don't see coming and it's a sick twist with no resolution. At least give some resolution to something like that and give the poor girl who has been tortured for years a break already.",1374624000,,364,4.140845070422535
8384268,1,B002YKD77C,I watched this solely because it had Norman Reedus and I have never been more disappointed in my life. It's just terrible. It's predictable in every way and just an all around s***ty movie. It's full of hack acting and plot holes. I recommend it for die hard Reedus fans but that's about it. It's not worth the money at all.,1369612800,2,324,4.327868852459017
8384269,3,B002YKD77C,"I don't really know what to say about this movie. Got this after a friend and fellow Norman Reedus addict told me about it. Watched the whole thing yesterday and then spent all day today wondering what the hell happened. The story was intriguing, the acting was decent and the scenery was beautiful, but I was still left underwhelmed. The ""twist"" at the end of the film was not just awkward but creepy and mildly disturbing. So all in all I don't really know how to catigorize this film. it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it certainly wasn't the best. Norman was very good as he always is and brought a certain vunerability to the role of a crazy meth making rapist, which is not easy. The lead actor Tim Draxl was very good, did an awesome american accent, and certainly added something to his disturbed character. So I wouldnt discourage a Norman fan from watching this but anyone just looking for a good twisted horror movie watch something else.",1360108800,3,960,4.554913294797688
