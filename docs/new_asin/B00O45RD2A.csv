Had he lived longer he could have been more well known.  for those who don't know his music, check it out and if you like it this makes a nice addition.",1414800000,4,312,4.327586206896552
8681935,5,B00O45RD2A,"Gary's Point of Departure LP found me in 1977, been searching for all things Gary ever since, so this package is an audio and visual overload of unheard and unseen, an overload I can take!!! The order delivered super fast! The photographs shared are awesome. Please look for my Gary song playlist ""Gary McFarland: the Jazz Version"" that I created on YouTube, based upon the discography by St. Clair and others.",1529193600,,410,4.788732394366197

8681944,5,B00O45RD2A,"Jazz lovers will probably love this documentary regardless.  I, on the other hand, am not a music expert nor had I heard of Gary McFarland.  I loved this film from a documentary movie perspective.  It's a great story about an adult prodigy.  This is fascinating to anyone interested in an artist never fully recognized and a life cut short.  I've read there were questions about the authenticity of the documentary Searching for Sugar Man, which kind of ruined it for me, like they manipulated the documentary aspect to make a more compelling story.  I don't think there could be any questions about the integrity of this film and the natural story arch, at least from the presented footage and editing.  This is what I want in a documentary -- thrilling on the merit of the topic and accessible to anyone.",1415145600,4,806,4.714285714285714
