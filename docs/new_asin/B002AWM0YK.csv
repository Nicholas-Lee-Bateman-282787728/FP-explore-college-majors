8360511,1,B002AWM0YK,Very disappointed with this item. Very little content about German paratroops. It's more like a general history of WW2. The first DVD had almost no footage of paratroops and the second one was only a little better. They were even showing pictures of regular German infantry and calling them paratroopers. I would NOT recommend buying this to anyone. You can get more info and more pictures in a book. And there are historical DVDs about German paratroops that have a lot more content than this.,1320192000,5,494,4.823529411764706
8360512,5,B002AWM0YK,"The Green Devils DVD set gives you the history of German paratroopers, from 1933 to 1945, with details on tactics, equipment, battles and roles they played in ground combat.  It was the Soviet experiments in this new form of warfare that would cause Germany to show an interest in forming the fallschirmjaeger in the first place.
While history seems to think that the German paratroops were, in the end, a failure, the DVDs show that they were able to carry out some operations that regular troops might not have been able to carry out.  Even the invasion of Crete is amazing when you realize the Allies had more troops, had the advantage of being the defenders, and KNEW the Germans were coming - they had detailed information on when and where the Green Devils would be dropping.  Yet, even with heavy loses the Germans DID take Crete.
If you enjoyed this DVD set - in other words if you already have it - I would suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Devils-German-Paratroopers-1939-1945/dp/2908182610/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Devils: German Paratroopers 1939-1945</a>&nbsp;which gives a more fragmented first person history of the paratrooper arm of the Luftwaffe.",1271721600,3,1227,5.550802139037433
