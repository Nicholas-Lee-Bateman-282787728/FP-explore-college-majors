734908,4,6303922511,I am a 6th grade reading and language arts special education teacher.  I showed this movie after reading the Chapter book.  My students enjoyed the movie as well as finding the differences and similarities between the movie and book.  This movie follows the book as well as some extra dialogue and scenes. Great movie to show after reading The Whipping Boy.,1239148800,21,357,4.819672131147541
734909,4,6303922511,"The story by Sid Fleischman is, in my opinion, not treated fairly in the video adaption, as is often the case when movies are made from books, the book is much better.  I don't know why the people behind the movie felt the need to add extra characters or stray from the story line.  Still, the movie is entertaining.  Children who have devoured the book can enjoy the movie, noting differences, and deciding for themselves which has more appeal.  For me, as it almost always the case, I prefer the book.",1227398400,,503,4.4945054945054945
734910,5,6303922511,"I bought this movie for my two oldest children back in the mid-90s.  I've since lost my VHS copy and had hoped to purchase it on DVD for my daughter who is now six.

The plot was engaging and funny, while there were no swear words or gratuitous violence to contend with.  The movie also included excellent cinematography that made the setting (a fictional European country) seem real.

It truly amazes me that this movie isn't on DVD!",1210809600,,434,4.5256410256410255
734911,5,6303922511,"...the other two being Lord of the Rings trilogy and ""Wind in the Willows.""  I am very wary of movies that are made from great books because they never seem to be able to recapture the joy and feeling that you experienced while reading.  However, this is one of the few movies that actually does and improves on the book while doing it!  The acting is simply superb, and the transformation of Prince Brat is even more meaningful because Truan Munro does such a fantastic job chewing the scenery as the spoiled prince.  I use this movie in my classroom after reading the book, and it is a great springboard to talk about how some movies are changed (for better or worse) and why certain scenes would be added or deleted.  The kids also love to talk about the theme of ""friendship"" which runs rampant throughout this movie.  There is actually one swear word, which is the same one as in the book.  If you are going to show this to a group of children, you would need to mute over that part, but it's a small price to pay for such a fantastic experience.  This is one movie that I am sad has been overlooked, since it so effortlessly combines realism and fiction, with a few life lessons to tie it all together along the way.",1187827200,2,1222,4.352422907488987
734912,5,6303922511,"""Prince Brat and the Whipping Boy"", though fairly different from the novel, is an endearing film I have watched dozens of times. The children are spectacular (although I did tire of Jemmy's bratty sister, AnnieRose, whom I thought exceeded Prince Horace in terms of annoyance.. except I liked the prince, so I'm a little off.. XD), the villains (and Grandmama) are scary for children but still comical enough to not cause nightmares, and the plot is simple but the points are very clear. Though this is a family film, it deals with serious topics, such as both the prince and Jemmy losing their parents (although one of the prince's losses is not in the sense you may think). Also, whipping boys DID exist in the time period this film was set in, between the late 1700's and mid- 1800's. There are a few parts that might make you a little sad, but there is a heartwarming turn of events that will cheer you up right away. There are many lines you will take pleasure in repeating as well. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!

Prince: I'm bored!

Grandmother: Well, go and do it somewhere else. You're driving me mad!",1114041600,7,1098,4.568527918781726
734913,4,6303922511,"My wife and I just sat down to watch this movie on television.  WE loved it so much we wanted to add it to our personal collection.  It was a fantastic family film.  Rated G and had to swearing, no major violence, just good wholesome humer.  Very impressed!",1102636800,,257,4.291666666666667
734914,4,6303922511,"This film is an absolute treasure.  It was great when I was a child and I still derive great joy from watching it.  The plot is sound, the characters fun and believable.  The attention to historical detail and soundtrack are also excellent.  If you are into high thriller action films with random passionate scenes and lots of violence, this is not your movie.  But if you like to sit down and watch an uplifting and fun period film, this is worth a watch!",1075939200,20,456,4.445783132530121
734915,1,6303922511,This movie really let me and my entire family down it was not even close to anything I or any of my family members would pay free money for let alone hard earned money that we through away on this bogus movie.

But in all, it was very similar to the novel. My 9 year old students loved it about as much as they loved The Whipping Boy. Great novel and great movie. I would defiantly recommend both. The movie has some violence and scary moments, but very mild. I probably wouldn't recommend the movie for ages 7 or younger.",1390608000,,446,4.385542168674699

Yes I took into account it was fairly old so the resolution was VHS weak but that didn't account for that little pretentious dweeb they chose to play the prince, god I hate to speak harshly of anyone's child but that kid was insipid and if he was acting he definitely deserved a littlle mini Oscar like Shirley got!

735206,4,6303922511,"The Whipping Boy premiered 7/31/1994 on the Disney Channel with some references in Variety to a 120 minute run time. It was released theatrically in the U.S. 9/28/1995 with a 96 minute run time. When I saw that Amazon.com is creating DVD-R copies with a 113 minute run time, I purchased it thinking it was a director's cut with a run time of the premiere, but the DVD-R I received has the same 96:34 run time of the theatric release. I haven't found a way to advise Amazon.com that they are misrepresenting this product. I did compare the DVD-R to the 2009 DVD version distributed by Feature Films for Families and found that FFFF cut about 2 minutes from the 96:34 version in 20 edits. Curiously, Jemmy says ""gol"" three times in the 96:34 version and Annyrose says it once -- FFFF used a 1 second cut to remove one of Jemmy's gols and a 2-second cut to remove Annyrose's, but left the other two instances untouched.",1325894400,7,916,4.491017964071856

735209,5,6303922511,"Rated-G. Made for the Disney-Channel.

Filmed on location in the countryside of France, in a castle, village, and forest. Lavish costumes, sets. Plenty of soldiers, courtiers, and a couple of bad-guys. Two boys coming to friendship through adventure.

The royal family does not believe the prince and future king should be whipped with servants gossiping in the castle; so an orphan, boy is abducted and takes the punishment for the prince, and is paid for his pain. Not as far-fetched in England where misbehaving school-children were regularly whipped with a cane in the public schools; I know for sure through the 1930's, and maybe later. This is a very brief part of the plot.

The king is too busy to spend anytime with his son the prince, and rejects his young son's requests for activities. The young prince tries to get attention, and let his father know he is sad, by retaliating for each rejection with mischievous pranks. An ambassador is visiting trying to avert war. The young prince pulls his pranks on the ambassador, and then his father, with both sides thinking the other responsible. Thus, the young-prince pushes the two, kingdoms to the brink of war.

The young-prince and the orphan-boy run away on quite an adventure. A good moral in the end. The film moves at a good pace with plenty of action, interest, and humor. The orphan-boy's little sister has her own troubles elsewhere.",1277769600,6,1401,4.873949579831932

I'm so stoked this is the production that was shown on Disney Channel, pre-Hanna Montanna and all that crap, when they had a classic theater piece.  It was such a great adaptation of the book.  While my memory is a bit fuzzy, I do know that at the time I was very into Dickens and other English classics, along with a total addiction to the Avonlea series, and this movie really left an impact on me as a teenager (over ten years ago).  It's such a delight to know that it is available now on DVD format.  If you liked the book, this is a respectable adaptation that will be a wonder to watch!  I HIGHLY recommend the purchase, but for my own greed.  If more people will buy this, then maybe we will see more of these classics available to own!  lol  By which, I mean, I will be able to own them!!!  ^____^",1267401600,9,841,4.104294478527607
