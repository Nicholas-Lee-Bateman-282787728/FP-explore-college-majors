8761846,5,B01FZ8E63I,"One of the better Yuri Comedy series out there, it wastes no time establishing the romance and explains it in a fair but believable way. It's pretty funny series with few jokes falling flat, the art style is nice and the backgrounds are like eye candy at times. So if You like Yuri, and very heartwarming shows, this is a must buy.",1503619200,2,331,4.354838709677419
