5733530,3,B00CPTUNUG,Only one of these movies was good and that is X-ray.  The comedy factor is lost in schizoid and it is just not a very good film.  BUT I still think X-Ray is a fantastic B-Horror movie and the people who saw it with me loved the film.  Schizoid has some weird scenes with the father staring at his naked daughter in the shower which makes it creepy in a not good kind of way.  It just is in bad taste and based on the rumors and claims by the lead actors own daughters of abuse it kind of sickens me that I have to have this in a dual pack with X-Ray.  Barbie Benton and crew in X-Ray are hilarious.  I mean the hospital staff is so incompetent and the kill scenes will have people laughing hysterically if you find the funny and ridiculous 80's slasher films kill scenes funny.  Which I assume you do if you are reading this.  So X-Ray is X-ellent.  But Schizoid you can Skipzoid.  Also if you don't know Scream Factory and are a horror fan you should get to know them quickly because they are doing some awesome stuff.,1381363200,4,1019,4.153061224489796
5733531,5,B00CPTUNUG,This is two hard to find movies plus you get Barbie Benton in the nude.  Really fun flicks from the 1980's when horror was not PG 13.,1380758400,14,133,3.925925925925926
5733532,4,B00CPTUNUG,"If you're a fan of 1980's slasher movies this is a fun double feature of two from Cannon Pictures that had never been released on DVD.  Neither is a classic or especially gory but both are quite fun in their own ways.  X-Ray is a far better hospital slasher pic than Halloween 2 and features Barbi Benton who is trapped in a hospital after a mysterious stalker switches out her routine test results.  Doctors won't tell her what is supposed to be wrong with her and also won't let her leave until further tests are performed.  The killer systematically knocks off anyone who might figure out that the scary test results are bogus, working his way up to Ms. Benton.  X-Ray cleverly plays off of people's sense of vulnerability when they're in the hospital and offers up some completely unnecessary nudity and cheap thrills along the way.  Shizoid is probably the classier of the two films in that the stars include Klaus Kinski (Nosferatu; Fitzcarraldo), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future; Taxi) and Craig Wasson (Body Double).  It's a mystery where an advice columnist finds that members of her therapy group are being murdered off one by one.  Could the murderer be the perverted and unethical psychiatrist played by Kinski or his deeply troubled teenage daughter?  Or a member of the group?  Or the heroine's ex, who also happens to be her boss at the newspaper (Wasson)?  Schizoid isn't particularly stylish or bloody but if you like this type of thing it definitely gets the job done.  Both films look nice and, considering that the only existing home video versions were VHS copies, the Blu-ray is obviously a huge improvement over what was previously available.",1380672000,4,1671,4.824561403508772
5733533,3,B00CPTUNUG,"Both fun movies to watch for the avid collector of ""the golden age"" of Horror, but both are quite mediocre films. They both have their moments and are pretty good, but neither is great. Quite a few logic flaws and plot holes in each, but definitely a good combo and worth owning.",1379980800,2,279,4.384615384615385
5733534,5,B00CPTUNUG,"DVD transfer of X-Ray is fantastic, much better than vhs copy I've got when it was called Hospital Massacre. I collect bad movies & this gem is king of the bunch!! It takes all the time-honoured slasher elements and ramps them up to unbelievable heights of stupidity and goriness - kind of hospital a normal person would've steered clear of in the first place, heroine who's so stupid & badly acted (Barbi seems most comfortable when she's undressed, otherwise she's only got two switches - bitchy or slightly annoyed) you're rooting for the killer, at times very inventive goriness, with medical instruments galore why not, an overacting killer - you swear he's going to inhale that face mask. The famous examination scene is hysterical though it goes on interminably, we get it - she's got big fake boobs that don't ever move no matter what. The ex-husband and his orange - you have to see it to understand it. Nurses that belong in one of those Linda Blair nudie prison flicks. The music played while murders are going on is so odd it drains whatever tension there could be and you wind up laughing. I've watched X-Ray five times so far and it keeps getting better with each viewing - this is the Holy Grail of Bad Slasher Films. The other flick, Schizoid, is pretty decent - the woefully underrated Craig Wasson is best thing in it, Klaus Kinski does his bug-eyed weirdo routine, Marianna Hill is the overly nervous Nellie heroine, the whole Donna Wilkes subplot gets tedious though it gets the flick where it's going - movie's not the incredible gem X-Ray is, but it's an agreeable time filler. All in all, great price for one must-have and one not bad movie.",1379894400,7,1664,4.663265306122449
5733535,5,B00CPTUNUG,"I just received this in the mail yesterday. I bought the set for X-ray aka Hospital Massacre. I haven't seem Schizoid as of yet. The transfer of x-ray is really good, and you can actually see what's going on in the dark scenes at the end of the movie now. X-ray is a good horror movie which stars Barbi Benton. This is the longer version of the film which is 1 hr 29 minutes, not the edited down version of the film, which is a plus. The only negative thing I can say about this set is there are no subtitles for the hearing impaired. Including that would have made the set perfect. I would highly recommend this set for fans of this film. Sell your VHS version and buy this.",1379376000,3,675,4.1603053435114505
5733536,5,B00CPTUNUG,"Just received and watched the X-Ray/Schizoid BluRay/DVD combo yesterday. Shout did a fantastic job on the resolution on both films. It was like watching the films for the first time. X-Ray has an interview with Boaz Davidson and Schizoid has an interview with Donna Wilkes (what a treat!) and a trailer. My only qualms is that I wish they had audio commentary for both films and a trailer for X-Ray. Other than that, I recommend everyone purchasing these great films.",1377561600,16,467,4.85
5733537,5,B00CPTUNUG,"Hey horror fiends and lovers. Just wanted to say that the transfer of X Ray is not super dark anymore like the vhs transfer was. You can see what is going on in the darker scenes in the hospital. The transfer is super great now and so is Schizoid. Both movies are above average slashers. The description for both is stated by amazon above so I won't go into detail. I got this off of ebay a month early and the only flaw is a hole punch in the UPC. I also pre-ordered off of here and giving the other copy to a friend. So anyway, Klaus Kinski and Donna Wilkes. Great father daughter combination in Schizoid. The only special feature for that movie is an interview with the Donna. X Ray has an interview with the director Boaz Davidson (I think I'm close with the last name - too lazy to check - Ha!). The best part of X Ray is seeing the three killer kids from Bloody Birthday making a cameo in this movie. Some brilliant producer must have decided to use these kids in one or the other (BB or X Ray) movie first and use them in whichever came later because they have great chemistry. God bless child actor extroardinarre Billy Jacoby (now Jayne) for his awesomeness in BB, Cujo, X-Ray and Superstition and some others maybe. Jacoby/Jaynes did quite a bit of horror as child actors. Anyway, I know I'm all over the place with this review but I just wanted to have a horror moment over the well-lighted scenes of X Ray (aka Hospital Massacre) now and make others aware. Just like they lightened up Humongous. Now for the love of Satan please release Edge of the Axe on BD/DVD.",1374883200,22,1575,4.324324324324325
5733568,4,B00CPTUNUG,X-Ray was awesome!!  Very cool film with a beautiful Barbi Benton.  Schizoid was ok.  May have to re-watch it to see if it grows on me.  The transfers looked great!,1462147200,,164,4.366666666666666

5733571,5,B00CPTUNUG,"I bought this for Hospital Massacre only. I don't know why they call it X-Ray. Anyway, this old slasher is awesome! It's pure cheese. It's filled with so many red herrings it's laughable but you gotta love it. Every guy in the movie looks at Barbi like they're potentially the killer. And her nude scene! Sadly, after this she only did deathstalker. Buy this for Barbie and I guess the other movie is a bonus!",1453939200,2,409,4.466666666666667
5733572,4,B00CPTUNUG,"I had seen X-RAY before under the title ""Hospital Massacre"" and remember really liking it. This time I didn't like it as much. Didn't remember the characters being so dumb and/or unlikable. It is a fun Slasher flick though and it looks good on Blu Ray.

SCHIZOID was a first time watch for me, wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it started pretty good with a chase/stalking scene then it got kinda slowwww. The cast was good, but I feel it needed something more.",1451260800,,465,4.470588235294118
5733573,2,B00CPTUNUG,"Now, I'm a huge fan of 80's horror movies but even I have my standards. In short, both movies feel like cheap cash ins on the slasher boom started by the original Halloween film (X-Ray even takes place in a hospital like Halloween II). As for the movies themselves, X-Ray is a hospital based slasher about a guy in doctor scrubs killing patients with surgical equipment but the real reason the movie was made appears to be the overlong nude scenes featuring the main actress. If you are looking for a decent hospital based horror movie, I do recommend the under rated Visiting Hours also released by Shout Factory. As for Schizoid, other than the fact that Body Heat star Greg Wasson and Back to the Future's Doc Brown himself Christopher Lloyd give decent performances, at the end of the day this is just another masked killer chasing people around flick but adds elements of psychology to try to make itself appear smarter. German film legend Klaus Kinski is the main star but appears to be sleepwalking.",1450569600,2,1006,4.6892655367231635

5733575,5,B00CPTUNUG,"Review for X-ray AKA Hospital massacre.

This is indeed a long lost treasure of an 80's movie, very cool slasher film with your usual cheesy set up and story but so much fun, this is certainly very different from your usual traditional slashers with its surrealism and nightmarish scenes, this time a killer is lurking on the 8th and 9th floor of a creepy hospital and one woman's past is back to get her! Loads of cool kills, not major gore but plenty of blood spurting! There is some nice nudity too and plenty of it which is a tradition in all good 80's slashers, Barbi Benton the lead female star was a playboy model and is very beautiful and has a very demanding role with plenty of screaming and fighting as well, this is a rare horror that certainly must be in your slasher collection.",1435104000,,792,4.424657534246576

5733591,2,B00CPTUNUG,"Sigh. Where to start? X-Ray is downright terrible as Barbi Benton winds up in the hospital from hell thanks to several implausible circumstances. This is a poorly done slasher flick that had me kicking myself for staying through to the ending.

I was really looking forward to finally seeing Schizoid after 30 or so years and was disappointed to say the least. Schizoid has the extremely twitchy Klaus Kinski and is the only reason this set gets an extra star. Klaus is the red herring as members of a therapy group get knocked off one by one and Klaus seems to be the logical suspect. You've seen it all before and done better.",1419724800,,628,4.557522123893805

Any slasher (because it's also trendy these days) than can have a Blu treatment is worth re-discovering. Be warned that they are both below par. Both copies are also mediocre, sound and image. As it's  double bill, price is Ok and comes with interviews that are fun, informative. But that's about it. Nostalgia ride it is, but don't expect much more.",1408406400,,436,4.7368421052631575

8584756,5,B00CPTUNUG,"Scream Factory continues their fun series of blu-ray double features with this excellent pairing of 1981's ""X-ray"" and 1980's ""Schizoid"" which were both produced and released by the infamous Cannon Group. While neither film is particularly good by normal standards of quality, viewed instead from an early 80's horror/sleaze/slasher angle they are a great deal of cheesy fun.

Scream Factory has given each film its hi-def debut on blu-ray by putting both on one dual layer disc. (They also made this a combo pack so you get a DVD copy as well for when your kids need their ""X-ray"" / ""Schizoid"" fix on family trips.) Since each film runs 89 minutes, the bit rate manages to still stay pretty high in the upper 20's for the most part so no compression artifacts are seen. While it is clear no full blown restoration was done on either film, the prints used are in pretty good shape with nice detail and colors. Some intermittent specks pop up here and there but not too frequently.  The aspect ratio for each film has been opened up a bit from 1.85:1 to 1.78:1. Audio is presented in 2 channel master audio and sounds quite punchy with nice definition.

Despite both films sharing a dual layer blu-ray, some nice extras were still able to be included. ""X-ray"" gets a little over 13 minute interview with the director Boaz Davidson and ""Shizoid"" gets an almost 11 minute interview with actress Donna Wilkes as well as the original theatrical trailer.

Fans of early 80's horror sleaze should eat this fun double feature up. The films look good in their HD debut and this release comes highly recommend.",1487980800,2,1600,4.724014336917563
