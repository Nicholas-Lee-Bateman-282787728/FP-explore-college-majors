2018320,5,B0001NBMAS,"Comedy about how an efficiency expert, Spencer Tracy, shakes up things at a company by installing a first generation main frame computer. Katherine Hepburne represents the old way of doings thing by hand. Naturally, amusing conflicts occur between them.  But so does romance.",1504828800,,275,5.395348837209302
2018321,5,B0001NBMAS,"This is an extremely well done screen adaptation of a unique play. You expect nothing less from the team of Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. However they do not distract from the performances of the other actors who are well-known in their own right. Harry Ellerbe, who plays Smithers, played the main role of Richard Sumner in the play.
Bunny and her staff and the research department are all preparing for Christmas season. But who should appear on a seen but the mysterious Richard Sumner, with a tape measure, 24 questions, and mysterious past in electronic brains. The conversation between Richard Sumner and Bunny are worth with film its self; yet it only gets better from there.
Like many plays the real worth and interest is in the dialog and interaction of the characters more than the action or the overall story. You will get wrapped up in the fun and wince once in a while.",1504051200,,889,4.705128205128205

2018353,5,B0001NBMAS,Love Spencer and Tracy. This film just makes laugh thinking of how we are so much into relying on computers for everything. Also sad commentary on how many don't use their own brains.  But overall great movie.,1486166400,,209,4.648648648648648

2018358,3,B0001NBMAS,"Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to view all the movies in the Tracy & Hepburn Collection until today. I was an hour into ""The Sea Of Grass"" when the screen went black, and after awhile, there was a totally different movie on the screen. I don't know what the other movie was, as it was not the beginning of the movie. Maybe the middle, or end. I don't know. It was not Katherine Hepburn or Spencer Tracy. I had hoped ""The Sea Of Grass would come back on the screen, but it never did, so I didn't get to see the end of the movie. Last part I saw was Tracy standing near the bed, where Hepburn was lying with her new born son beside her. The other movies in the collection were fine, just this one was bad. Anyone who purchases this collection, should make the time to watch all the movies, before it is too late to get a replacement.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Hepburn-Complete-Collection-DVD/dp/B004K4FUT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy & Hepburn Complete Collection (DVD)</a>",1482969600,,1033,5.011627906976744

2018384,5,B0001NBMAS,This is my favorite Hepburn and Tracy comedy.  It has a Christmas theme which I enjoy this time of year.,1482192000,,104,4.2
2018385,5,B0001NBMAS,"This excellently acted mid-century romantic comedy thoughtfully addresses conflicts arising with the ascendence of women to more generally meaningful and prominent roles in mainstream business life, and the specter of machine intelligence displacing thousands of accounting and information workers. It also provides a tasty look into styles, popular culture, and mores of the 1950s workplace --- granted somewhat idealized. The magical chemistry of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy is, of course, the element making this one of the great movies of all times.",1482105600,,561,5.771084337349397

2018404,1,B0001NBMAS,Tracy and Hepburn are simply wonderful. The one star review is because Sea of Grass switches to another film (Red Riding Hood) half way through. Due to a busy life I did not discover this issue until 5 years after purchase. I do no expect to be compensated. However I did want to express my disgust at the selling of items with a known problem. I also discovered that my Val Lewton Collection had a corrupted disc. Very disappointing.,1481587200,,434,4.506329113924051

2018482,5,B0001NBMAS,"This is one of my favorite Hepburn/Tracy film and personally would put it right up there with ""Adam's rib"".  It doesn't get the credit other Hepburn/Tracy films like ""Adam's rib"" and ""Guess who's coming to dinner"".  It's light, funny, and witty with great supporting cast such as Joan Blondell.  Dina Merrill makes her film debut and is decent in it (she's still alive by the way).  Script is mediocre but the cast and their chemistry make this a very enjoyable film.  The ending is fun.  Highly recommended.",1475020800,,508,4.781609195402299

2018487,2,B0001NBMAS,"Maybe there was a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor about this that I just didn't get, but I did not like this movie. I usually like Katherine Hepburn, but she seemed like a weird and awkward caricature here. The best part about the movie was Joan Blondell. Her warm energy held everything together. Gig Young was pretty convincing playing his one-dimensional character. Spencer Tracy was fine doing what he does. And the Tracy/Hepburn chemistry is always great. Hepburn's character, who is smart and wise, didn't need to be portrayed in such a sugar-coated way.",1474848000,,559,5.021505376344086

The ladies in this movie are the Google of the pre internet days and it is so interesting to realize how much information people like them had to retain (or know where to find) so they could spout it off to callers looking for answers to their questions.  Amazing how far we've come since the days of  computers that took up whole rooms, to being able to ask your phone which baseball player had the best batting average of all time.  An adorable love story and a history lesson, all rolled up into one.  Watch it!",1471564800,,646,4.305785123966942

2018574,5,B0001NBMAS,"What a delightful movie the Desk Set is! Fast paced, chockfull of wit, and with an ambience that belies its years. Phoebe and Henry Ephron (Nora Ephron's parents) were the inspired scriptwriters, and they created a little jewel that sounds almost  like a contemporary play. The magic that Katharine Hepburn's and Spencer Tracy's special relationship typically exudes in their movie collaborations permeates the Desk Set as well. A great support cast including Gig Young as the ""other"" suitor, as well as Joan Blundell and Dina Merrill as Hepburn's colleagues add to the success of Desk Set. And shouldn't we compliment the role of Merrimac, the primitive computer that determines who gets fired and hired? Definitely a must- see film.",1471046400,,734,5.168067226890757

2018614,4,B0001NBMAS,"Bottom line first:
Tracy and Hepburn, The Definitive Collection is exactly what it says it is.  All 9 of their movies in 1 box. My experience is that collections are designed to contain at least one or more bad movies. Not all of these are equals. None are bad. If you like having them all, of whatever the collection; his is a good way to get these two in one buy.  I experienced no technical problems with any of the DVDs and the extras made for an even better value. On value, I have seen this package can vary a lot. Timing can matter. But quality of content justifies your jumping in at a higher price.

Just a few thought about most of the features in this collection.

I had hesitated to watch Guess Whos Coming to Dinner. 1967, the most recent of these movies seems the most out of date. A modern family would love to have a physician for a son in law, in particular one as handsome as Sidney Poitier and as well behaved as John Prentice. What struck me was that the real issue was never fully addressed. Neither family was opposed to the fact of their children entering into an inter-racial marriage. The problem was that in that day and time, the treat to both the couple and any off spring was potentially physical. There was no reason to shame the Tracy character for his hesitation, he was thinking of the harm that might come to them both.

Without becoming too political, Keeper of the Flame is about a recent widow of a hugely rich and popular business man. One who was expected to be the savior of his 1940s America but who was perhaps not as All-American as he seemed. This becomes an it could happen here movie about how easily money and a few gestures can ease the way for a populist person to introduce totalitarianism into America.

Woman of the Year is mostly another nice enough movie. It is entertaining, and then comes Kate Hepburn doing a slapstick comedy breakfast routine. All by herself see is twice as funny as anything the Three Stooges ever attempted.
Sea of Grass is the sleeper movie. It begins with Tracy as the obvious villain but is he? Where else to we see Hepburn betray her marriage. This is not great movie making but. Little about this movie is classic Hollywood drama, or western or liberal politics. There is more depth and layers to this movie than I had thought that period, never mind these two performers provided.

Without Love perhaps the worst of the movies here, but still entertaining. Two people fall into what might be a loveless marriage. It has the makings of a classic farce but a little late.",1469232000,,2552,4.463519313304721
2018615,5,B0001NBMAS,"Great movie, funny seeing how the offices first handled changing to computers.",1469145600,,78,5.583333333333333

2018642,5,B0001NBMAS,"The movie are mostly great (I didn't like GWCTD and Keeper of the Flame). The movies are so great I WOULD knock of 1 star due to DVD sound. Why are some DVDs have LOW LOW volume??!!!!  I have to put my TV up to max w/ CC. Still Adam's Rib and Desk set are wonderful. I could watch Desk Set 2 times a month and NOT get sick of it. If reader is not familiar with their works together, Hepburn fell in love (and had a long affair, neither marring each other) with Tracy when he was still in a unstable marriage. So, perhaps in the early 1950's, she was hated for this. Anywho, the best films here are Adam's Rib: the duo play are married couple who happen to be both lawyers. As a new sensational case pops up they are assigned to councel both sides. She the defense, he the prosecutor!! Desk set: Dated as it is, this movie has snappy dialog as Hepburn as a fact chequer at a think tank and Tracy is a business manager/ computer expert (of the electronic BRAIN! I love it!) Extremely fun! State of the union: Tracy is running for the 1948 presidential election and Hepburn is his estranged wife. The cast here is where the real heat is, excellent ensomble. I covered my favorites in this set.",1466726400,,1190,4.219298245614035

Tracy and Hepburn have the great chemistry you would expect.

2018783,5,B0001NBMAS,"One thing about this movie is that it is Tracy/Hepburn at their best.  Excellent comedy and history of IBM actually.  In Europe this movie was  released as ""The Other Woman"" referring to EMERAC (the computer).  If you know this, the movie is even funnier.  It's a love triangle (on both sides), with a well written script from Nora Ephron's Dad, Henry Ephron, and so well done.  It holds up now even with the outdated computer (we no longer really have full wall computers with tubes, unless you're talking something like the Super Cray Computer system in Livermore Labs.  We also feel that this movie can be watched time/again without losing its appeal.  It also is a Christmas cross-over movie, too, taking place at the 'Federal Broadcasting System' which is actually NBC.  Again, some background to make it even more ""juicier"" for those  watching it.  Enjoy!",1456531200,,861,4.86896551724138

Yes, there's an ill-advised musical number and the plot paints itself into an impossible corner. Still, I found this to be a charming movie all the same. Hepburn is perfectly cast as the head of a research department at a TV network. Tracy is an absent-minded scientist whose talk of computers has everyone afraid for their jobs. There's lots of smart dialogue, funny situations and some grownup innuendo (although this is definitely a family-friendly movie).

The movie had kind if a creepy forewarnng of things to come, even if it took 59 years.  In the end, this was a great movie full of great actors who are no longer with us.

2019005,4,B0001NBMAS,"Yes, to answer the question posed by the title of this sketch, before the Internet, before the whole web of now baffling sets of social networking and media outlets to while away the hours there was, well, a love story involving computers, and their uses back in the day, back in the 1950s days when one computer was housed in a whole room of some dimensions. Hard as it is to believe now that you can get a million times more information off of your smart phone than the humongous machines were capable of producing back in the 1950s this whole modern information superhighway superstructure posed certain questions then continue to haunt us today. That is the subtext to the film under review, Desk Set, the sophisticated romantic comedy starring the famous Hollywood acting couple Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey.
Ironically the story line of this film is set in the New York network broadcasting industry at a time when that medium, when conventional television, was king of the hill and which is now embattled with about six million other ways of getting information available at the click of a button. But like all business enterprises then and now, the bottom line was, and is, to get the biggest profits the most effective and cost-productive way possible. Enter automation, enter the replacement of the human factor with the efficiencies of the machine. Sound familiar? The way this one plays out is that Sam (played by Tracey), a crackerjack engineer who helped create the then first word in computers, was hired by the broadcast company to streamline its operations with the new machines (then mainly produced when they were of monstrous size by IBM) and one of the first targets was the research department headed by crackerjack head researcher Bunny (played by Hepburn and where the scriptwriters got the name Bunny for the very proper Miss H can only be accounted for by the old Wasp network of Sunnys, Bunnys, Muffys in horse country places or at institutions like Bryn Mawr). Thus the battle is joined.

Sam and Bunny do their dance, the dance around the subtext message at first about the uses of computers to streamline the research work process which had Bunny and her co-workers (three very smart women who nevertheless in the 1950s wound up as clerks in the research department rather than upstairs running things in the executive suites) worried about their jobs, and rightly so. That worry gets resolved rather simply when the obvious truth about information machines (then, now it might be a bit more problematic)-they are only as good as the humans who put the information in and analyze it meant they would  have more work to do rather than less and would have a higher rate of productivity to satisfy that bottom line. (That same condition applies today although on a global basis begging the question of who will be doing that more productive work-some Seven Sisters graduate or some up and coming smart woman in Mumbai.)

Nice theme but lets get back to reality for after all whether using computers or books as the subtext Hollywood is looking for a romantic resolution to a romantic comedy and while we can love our modern technology the fate of the computer is not going to fill seats in a movie theater. But the love triangle pitch certainly will. Bunny was, well, hung up on this guy, Mike, who was on his way up in the company but who couldn't commit to a serious relationship (a serious relationship meaning one that ended in marriage) until Sam came on the scene and started making Bunny think twice about her status as Mikes easy thing, as his dishrag. Naturally despite all the travails with the computers gumming up the works and the situation with Mike Bunny and Sam wound up as an item of gossip for the water cooler break crowd. See 1950s Hollywood didn't let us down.",1451174400,,3816,4.770045385779123
2019035,4,B0001NBMAS,"A great movie, a so-so DVD transfer, and as for the commentary: Neva Patterson recites background info on every actor as they each make their entrance, along with a few other items that are less than what one could find on IMDB, while Dina Merrill gives us lots of Dina Merrill anecdotes about just about every film she was in except ""Desk Set.""

2019037,1,B0001NBMAS,"I can see that this was probably a smart little Broadway play back in the 50s, but there's very little smart or funny about it now. The biggest laughs come from the characters themselves in certain scenes when they're doubled over with laughter but the audience (me) is staring wide-eyed and slack-jawed and asking ""Why?""  But the worst thing is casting these two actors who are on the verge of applying for their Social Security benefits in the roles of young lovers. It's just weird. I could swear that Hepburn is wearing some kind of prosthetic bandages to cover her arms in the rare scenes when you get to see her bare arms. She's obviously old enough to be Gig Young's grandmother--and we're supposed to believe that he's crazy in love with her??? At least with young actors the movie might have made some kind of sense, but as it is, it's just wacko. People who see some kind of ""magic"" between the two old stars are indulging in magical thinking.",1450051200,,953,4.573099415204679

2019442,1,B0001NBMAS,"I recently bought a copy of the 10-disk DVD set titled ""Tracy & Hepburn - The Definitive Collection"" from the mail-order company Daedalus Books. I discovered that the Sea of Grass disk would not play at all. I called Daedalus to report the problem, and they, very commendably, sent me a replacement copy for the one defective disk. Unfortunately, the replacement disk wouldn't play either. I took both copies of the disk over to a friend and tried them in his DVD player, but they wouldn't play on his machine either. Judging from the number of consumer complaints on Amazon about the Sea of Grass disk in the set, I am obviously not the only one experiencing the problem.

ATTENTION DVD COLLECTORS AND MOVIE BUFFS!  I am addressing the following to you because I imagine you are the consumers most likely to buy large DVD sets such as this one. Because of: (1) the frequent cost savings when buying large DVD sets, (2) the savings in shipping costs by buying multiple items at one time, and (3) the limited availability of some movies on DVD, one may find it necessary to buy more DVDs than one can play in a reasonable amount of time to determine whether they are defective.

Out of necessity, I came up with a procedure for determining whether a DVD is defective without investing the time it takes to play the disk all the way through. My experience has been there are 2 major types of defects:

(1) The most common defect seems to be that a disk won't play at all. Either my player rejects (and ejects) the disk as ""unrecognizable"" or ""defective"", or the disk keeps spinning endlessly but nothing is ever displayed on my TV screen. You can catch this defect very simply (and very obviously) by placing each disk in your DVD player. If a ""Main Menu"" type of screen is eventually displayed, then the disk is probably safe from this defect.

(2) The other common defect is that the movie stops progressing at some point during playing and often pixillates (digital breakup of the image). Catching this defect requires a little more work. Put the disk in the player and, assuming it passes Test 1, press PLAY and then switch to the fastest ""Fast Forward"" mode on your machine. If it gets to the end of the movie successfully, then you are probably safe from this defect. However, for DVDs with multiple paths (which is most of them), you must Fast Forward down every path you are concerned about. This means fast forwarding through each Special Feature. Also, if you have a DVD consisting of a series of TV episodes, you need to fast forward through each episode separately. If the DVD has a ""Play All Episodes"" option, selecting that will probably reduce the number of interactions needed to test the disk.

If your disk passes these 2 tests, then the odds are pretty good that it will play okay when you finally have the time to watch it in its entirety. But if it fails either test, if possible, try it on a friend's machine to rule out the possibility that your DVD player is ""on the fritz"".

Above all, don't assume that, just because a DVD is factory-sealed, it is pristine and free of defects. Based on my experience and that of other consumers who have submitted DVD reviews on Amazon, quality control in the DVD industry seems to be nothing short of scandalous!",1428969600,,3271,4.581196581196581

2019484,3,B0001NBMAS,"Desk Set(released May/57)stars,among others,Katharine Hepburn,Spencer Tracy,Joan Blondell and Gig Young. This is barely a so-so entry in the Tracy-Hepburn series of films. Sure the chemistry is there between the two, but this plot is a slow and meandering one and while it promises much,it just never really delivers.
The story involves your run of the mill big city corporation which occupies,like countless others,a huge office tower. More precisely it is a broadcasting facility and it concerns the reference section,run by a very proficient Hepburn,assisted by Blondell and two others. She(Hepburn) has had an on going""relationship"" with Young for sometime now,but it is just spinning its proverbial wheels. Into this mix one day comes an efficiency expert in the form of Tracy. He is a very smart efficiency expert. He is there to see if a computer can't take the place of the reference library department. A computer he designed himself.
As many of these types of films go,Hepburn and Tracy's relationship while at first strictly on a business level,eventually turn romantic. Hepburn's tepid relationship with Young gets even more so until Hepburn finds herself in love with Tracy,and visa versa. Also with many of these films the computer when installed, while seemingly having the advantage and totally in control at first, soon cracks. It starts bogging down with the questions thrown at it and Tracy cannot seem to stop the ""bloodletting"" as it goes haywire. Finally the ""battle of the computer and the office staff ""comes to a swift conclusion as Tracy and Hepburn lock lips for the finale.
The plot is as see through as a piece of one sided paper. The progression of disaffection between Young and Hepburn is as obvious as the progress of affection between her and Tracy. Everything in between is just pure fluff. There is a running gag with veteran actress Ida Moore who comes in and out of the office for no apparent reason. Whatever it was it was never resolved and remains a puzzler of an inclusion in the film.
Technically speaking the film is in it original w/s a/r of 2:35:1. Extras include commentary,the trailer and some Fox Movietone news shorts. The picture quality is beautiful to see.
All in all this film is just another in a long line of films where star power was so supposed to overcome any kind of a deficiency in plot and/or production. Sorry, it wasn't funny or special to me in /57 and it certainly has not improved with age. 2 1/2 stars.",1422576000,,2471,4.899761336515513

I consider this a Christmas movie as it is mostly set over the Christmas and New Year's holiday season, and I watch it every year over the holidays. It's a mostly lighthearted romance movie, but what really sells it for me is that every character seems so realistic and quirky that you can't help but love them all. Especially fun to note that the rain/apartment scene with the bathrobe was ad-libbed by Spencer Tracy...you can tell that the women absolutely fall apart in laughter at the end because it wasn't scripted.",1419033600,,559,4.656565656565657

The price was perfect, less than $20 for a handful of high quality classics. Woman, Adam's Rib, Pat & Mike, State Of The Union, and Dinner are top drawer; the rest are little known curios but worth seeing once*. Still it's a bargain for the 5 best.
* The clunker is Desk Set, a godawful stiff widescreen production best left small. Hepburn plays a truly pathetic mousy old maid, the antithesis of her firey persona that complemented Tracy's loveable curmudgeon in the others.

Terrific script.  The acting is superb by every member of its wonderful cast.  Plenty of comical moments.

It has classic '50s looks, sets, costumes - and the old fashioned drinking in the office and want we would say today is sexual harassment.
I've seen this one a lot, and am constantly drawn back to it. One of my favorite scenes is when the two of them have lunch on the roof of a NYC high rise in December. It's cold but they're really eating sandwiches, shivering and carrying on an interesting, if nonsensical, conversation.

2019592,5,B0001NBMAS,"Hepburn's character is a provider of information of all kinds. All their research is by researching books and calling back with the information. But her perfect world comes to a screeching hault, when Tracy shows up and makes it look as if she would loose her beloved job.  From there the comedy ensues.  Everything that can go wrong and does.  One of the best comedy's the duo ever made.  Got tired of watching it when it made the TV rounds filled with commercials, and about every 10 years.  So I had to finally add it to my collection. Well worth the purchase. Especially if you are a comedy fan.  This is along the lines of Tracy's it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.  Which I also own. Both are well worth the time to buy.",1399939200,,724,4.318518518518519

2019595,5,B0001NBMAS,"When you have two brilliant actors, a great script, a fabulous wardrobe, etc., is it any surprise that the movie has survived the test of time as a classic? Tracy is an efficiency expert. Hepburn is the research employee he may be replacing with a computer. These two are dueling together the entire time including a classic scene up on the roof where he gives her an IQ test. Her late 1950s wardrobe is classic and gorgeous, based on the looks brought in by Dior in that era as the NEW LOOK. Gig Young plays Hepburn's sometimes boyfriend who takes her for granted. Tracy moves in on their relationship starting with being caught in the rain with Hepburn.  They get into robes and Gig Young walks in. Even though the work place has changed radically since this time, the universals between men and women remain the same so the movie is not dated. If you haven't seen this film, you really need to watch it soon. They also imagine a huge braniac type computer which takes over everything in reference. They do not envision personal computers connected to the internet, however. For fans of the late Nora Ephron, it is worth noting that the film's script was written by her parents. Nora followed her parents into screenwriting and then branched out to directing.

I worked at a company who purchased one of the ""new"" emeracs and it was primarily a inventory tracker/financial planning tool....I remember all the punch cards and the years people made door wreaths with them.

2019620,5,B0001NBMAS,"Great supporting cast, which includes Joan Blondell, a personal favorite of mine. It's a love story (what else?) that unfolds while a company is being computerized and the characters fear being replaced by advancing technology, still a very timely subject.",1390089600,,256,5.425
2019621,5,B0001NBMAS,"Though the computer technology seems quaint to us in the 21st century, the focus of the story is the intertwining of men vs. women and boy meets girl. Hepburn, true to the many characters she played over the years, is more than a match for any man. Though made at a time when most women stayed at home, Desk Set clearly establishes Hepburn's superiority. Her feckless suitor (played by Gig Young) advances his career on Bunny's intellectual back. She knows this but feels no one else will want her (given her implied over-30 age). She meets Tracy's character, a genius-level inventor who knows he is smarter than anyone in the room. He thinks that until he meets her. The running gag is an old chestnut--she thinks he wants to eliminate her department in favor of the computer. He is too smart to realize that he has not made clear that the computer is there only as an aid. (This theme of man vs. machine is one that still runs through cinema today.) The mix-up in intentions is a standard device in screw-ball comedies. Of course, everything is resolved at the end. The best scene in the movie is the one on the rooftop where Tracy challenges Hepburn with several puzzles. Of course, she more than meets these challenges. This is classic Tracy-Hepburn repartee aided by good dialog taken from the stage play. Another good scene is the Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight sequence that occurs when the computer confuses the Greek island Corfu with curfew. (Actually, the input person misunderstands and keys in ""curfew"" rather than ""Corfu."") A third nice sequence takes place in Bunny's apartment. The movie feels like a filmed stage production, but that is OK as it is the dialog and two master actors interacting that hold our attention. No car chases or robots are needed. The supporting cast is very good, but this is primarily a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle. There are no special effects that are often the deciding factor in acquiring a Blu-ray version. But the Blu-ray version is crisp and clear, and movies from over 50 years ago look as good or better than they did in theaters when viewed via Blu-ray DVDs on HD TVs. If you like romantic comedies, then Desk Set is better than most of the films in this genre made over the last 20 years.",1389916800,,2234,4.658227848101266
2019622,5,B0001NBMAS,Wonderful movie with two amazing actors.  Movie playback was flawless and very smooth on my HD set and the sound was crisp and clear.  My wife and I have enjoyed this movie for years and every time we watch it we laugh and smile a lot.,1389139200,,235,4.086956521739131

It's all there: great dialogue, the banters, comedy and the all-present love between them, almost palbable across the screen. Plus, a wonderful bonus in Joan Blondell's priceless sidekick!
No use extolling the film qualities at this point, since I guess it was chosen by the public for a Blu-ray presentation.
The Blu-ray remaster is probably one of the best jobs Fox has done so far with movies of this vintage. Colors are lovely well saturated, details and sharpness are amazing. Some minor focus issues are inherent to the then new CinemaScope process, but never detracting from the quality of the remaster.
Definetely worth the upgrading and waiting for Fox to dip further into their back catalog (""How to Steal a Million"", ""The King and I"" comes to mind...)",1388534400,,918,4.891025641025641

2019636,5,B0001NBMAS,"Patient elders will one day have to explain just about every aspect of Desk Set to the young uns, from the lack of technology to the bizarre treatment of women in the work force.  Hepburn plays almost-spinster librarian Bunny Watson, the head of research for a New York network news department.  She uses reference books.  Tracy plays a computer inventor who brings his new-fangled machine (blinking lights and rolling magnetic tape) into her office, and  Bunny is afraid she and her crack team will be automated right out of their jobs.

2019642,5,B0001NBMAS,"This was a great movie that had both humor and a bit of romance all mixed into one. One of the things that I loved about this movie was how computers were seen back in the day, and with Hepburn's character being the head of the research department, it reminded me a bit of my own wife and what she has to do daily as a librarian. Hepburn and Tracy are an amazing team, and you can easily see why they were considered the top actors of their day. This was a great movie that all should see and experience both for the great acting but also for the great story and chemistry between Hepburn and Tracy.

2019707,5,B0001NBMAS,"My favorite Christmas movie.

My fave Hepburn/Tracy.

Favorite career movie.

Fave historical movie.

Favorite buddy movie.

OK, it's just my favorite movie!

This movie was based on a play based on the life of a real librarian, and it's amazing to me how much DIDN'T get lost in translation. Librarians (as opposed to Google) are dedicated to giving information, giving accurate information, and giving ethical information, such that when Sylvia, played by Dina Merrill, says, ""Yes, there are poisons that leave no trace, but it is ...policy not to give that information out,"" it's clear real librarians were consulted in the making of this script.  I can't help it. I love a movie that portrays librarians accurately. Even old movies about middle-aged librarians.

Interestingly, the movie also predicts the failings of Internet searches even though no one really knew how that would work in 1957, that programs can't really evaluate and that the simplest misspelling would yield too much info or the wrong type.

Oh, wait a minute. I nearly forgot: there's a plot here. Tracy the curmudgeon falls in love with the passionate and misunderstood Hepburn again. Phew, got THAT off my chest. The relationship between the two principals follows a predictable arc. It's the best friend relationship between Hepburn and the underrated Joan Blondell that is some of the best writing I have ever seen!

The office politics, conspicuous consumption, sexism, and gossip of the time is beautifully done, observed rather than skewered, and a joy to watch.",1355788800,,1544,5.14

Only now, forty-odd years later, have I taken the trouble to track them down. These movies are even more stellar than I'd remembered. And the presentation, restoration or whatever is so very good; black-and-white they may be, but they show up on my TV screen as though they were filmed yesterday.

Of course, many of the films have been available individually, but this set also includes rarities such as KEEPER OF THE FLAME and THE SEA OF GRASS.

The problem with this collection is that fans of Tracy and/or Hepburn will have already gotten certain titles (WOMAN OF THE YEAR, ADAM'S RIB, PAT & MIKE) years before, so there's an unnecessary duplication.

I held off on buying this collection because of the reviews stating The Sea of Grass disk was defective.  Cutting off, not able to play etc.  Well, I put it in my Blu-ray player and this movie played without a hitch.  No problems at all.  Played straight through from beginning to end and it looks great too.  Maybe the problem had to do with the dual-layer issue.  I noticed on the back of the box inside the cover box, states that several movies one being Sea of Grass is dual-layer format.  But, every one of the movies in my box are not dual-layer.  Every movie is single layer recorded complete with paint color and the name of the movie etched on the top/front of the disk.

I'm happy I purchased Tracy & Hepburn The Definitive Collection.  I look forward to viewing each one of their wonderfully acted chemistry filled movies.

I felt it was important to give a quick short review to let potential buyer's know that I experienced no problems with The Sea of Grass disk.  In addition, the current price of twenty dollars and change is a hard thing to resist for nine films including bonus features and a bonus disk called The Spenser Tracy Legacy.

2019726,5,B0001NBMAS,"Most people who write a best movies list that includes a movie with Katherine Hepburn choose something other than Desk Set.  They may prefer Pat & Mike or Adam's Rib, titles that are much better known.  Almost certainly, they would name The African Queen, which deserves to be honored.

In fact, The African Queen will be the subject of my next review.  And of all the romantic comedies that Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy made together, Desk Set is my favorite - for one simple reason.  It's a science fiction movie.

No, it doesn't have ray guns, space ships, or aliens.  But it satisfies one of the most basic criterions of a science fiction plot: it's about how technology changes the lives of people who use it.  In this case, it's about a civilian application for an early computer, the EMERAC (probably based on the UNIVAC and the ENIAC).  Spencer Tracy plays the efficiency expert who is adapting the computer for a business interface, and Katherine Hepburn is the head of the reference department at a New York Magazine that will try to integrate the big computer into their operations.  Since the computer processes questions and is supposed to come up with instant answers, the reference staff is understandably nervous about their jobs.

This is one of the main conflicts in the story.  The employees in the reference department are all female, and you get a glimpse into the lives of an earlier generation of working women.  The wonderful Joan Blondell is Peg Costello - who, like the other gals in her department, is single, independent, and older than people probably expected a working woman to be in those days - old enough to be married, in other words.  They have to be ingenious to make ends meet, but you get the feeling that none of them have met a man for whom they would be able or willing to give up their independence - except, possibly for Hepburn's character, Bunny Watson.  She does have a fella she's serious about: Mike Cutler, played by Gig Young.  But he keeps putting her off until his career takes off, something it always seems to be on the verge of doing.  By the time the computer shows up, he's starting to take her for granted.

That's the other conflict in the story.  Because Tracy's character, Richard Sumner, is quite charmed by her.  He's fascinated by the way the women perform their jobs, especially by the way their memories work.  He notices that Bunny uses association as a memory tool.  And he enjoys the quick, witty responses she comes up with when they talk.  I suspect he also notices her trim figure and dazzling smile, but he is so unassuming and courteous, this is more of a conclusion than an observation.

Bunny tries very hard not to like Richard - after all, he's programming the electronic monster that will make her obsolete.  But something between them just seems to click, and pretty soon the luke-warm boyfriend begins to notice that he's got competition.  Suddenly he's  not so inclined to take her for granted.  But will he rally in time?

If you're familiar with the pattern in Hepburn-Tracy movies, you already know the answer to that question.  But the characters are so likable, you just can't help getting caught up in their lives.  And in the meantime, the big computer is looming over everybody's job, until the day when it generates a bunch of pink slips for the reference department.  Neither love nor computerization goes smoothly for anyone in this film.

But in the end, you cheer for both.  Desk Set is not a grand film that forever changed  the art form.  But it is an irresistible snapshot of a particular time and place, a moment of change in American business and American romance.  I watch it at least once every year, so I can take a brief vacation to that time and place.  That's why it goes on my list of the best.",1346284800,,3809,4.638266068759342

2019730,2,B0001NBMAS,"If it weren't for Tracy and Hepburn, this would be a total loser as a movie. It's still pretty dumb, but you might enjoy it just for the talent of those two, and of course the electricity between them. Or in the case, perhaps the electronics.

The opening credits assistance from ""International Business Machines,"" the original name for IBM. But the computer involved is so absurd that I'd think IBM would want to disavow it. It's not much like computers really were in 1957, nor is it much like they could have expected to become at some point in the future. At one point, someone holds up a thin pack of punch cards and declares that it contains the complete works of Shakespeare. Punch cards???? It would have taken quite a few boxes of cards to load the complete works of Shakespeare.

Katharine Hepburn plays Bunny Watson, head of the research department at Federal Broadcasting Company. She has an amazing memory, and works in a well-stocked reference library. She has three assistants, the senior one is Peg Costello (Joan Blondell). One day Richard Sumner (Spencer Tracy) shows up and starts measuring the office from every direction, asking strange questions, and then getting called to the Big Boss's office. Who is he and what is he up to?

The other character of significance is Mike Cutler (Gig Young), who has been dating Bunny for seven years without ever saying a word about marriage. Peg advises her that he never will propose because Bunny is too available, jumps to his call every time, and is never too busy to go out with him, even on very short notice.

But then Richard Sumner displays an obvious interest in Bunny (can you really see Kate Hepburn with the name Bunny???), while Mike makes it clear he simply takes her for granted. Most of the humor centers around this triangle, and the installation of this computer that is feared to replace the live human researchers. Can you predict that it will do nothing of the sort?

It's fluff, and the impossible computer is annoying, but if you can overlook the improbability of it all, you can probably have fun just watching Tracy and Hepburn.",1336780800,,2113,4.715447154471545

2019742,4,B0001NBMAS,"Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made 9 films over a 25-year period, and enjoyed one of Hollywood's most legendary offscreen romances during that period as well. Last year, Warner Bros. finally decided to treat this classic screen duo to a definitive box set containing every film they made together, including two that had never been released to DVD and three that are owned by other studios.

The pros:
1. Well, obviously, a huge pro is that we finally have all nine films in one set. Warner Bros. went the extra mile, going beyond their own library and licensing ""State Of The Union"" from Universal, ""Desk Set"" from Fox, and ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" from Sony.

2. The packaging is nicely done. All ten discs are in a clear double alpha case such as double-disc DVD's used to come in, only maybe a millimeter or two thicker, all inside a shiny cardboard slipcase. The discs all have new disc art - very plain, with only solid colors, but the look is quite classy. This configuration allows the set to take up very little room on your DVD shelf. The reverse side of the case insert has credits for the film and the inside contains a booklet with photos and information on each film. Everything is very classy and well-put-together.

3. The films themselves are quite good. Some are better than others, but there isn't a total dud in the whole set. Granted this opinion isn't entirely accurate, as I've only seen six of the nine films in the set, but the three I haven't seen yet (""Woman Of The Year,"" ""Adam's Rib,"" and ""Pat And Mike"" - I've previewed the discs, however.) are generally accepted as classics and I expect nothing less. A few films, such as ""Keeper Of The Flame"" and ""The Sea Of Grass"" have some story and pacing issues, but the pairing of Tracy and Hepburn elevates anything they touch out of total mediocrity.

4. Those last two films I mentioned were the last two Tracy & Hepburn films not to be issued on DVD - thanks to the release of this set, that has finally been rectified. Both films are available separately, as well, for those simply needing to complete their collections.

5. In general, transfers are good and bonus materials, while not bountiful, are still nice additions. (""State Of The Union"" is completely barebones - no trailer, not even a chapter menu, although there ARE chapter stops. I imagine MGM still retains promotional materials and such, which would prevent Universal from using them on the DVD.) The main attractions here are the films themselves, and for the most part, they are presented nicely. Most have some occasional issues here and there, but for their age, they mostly look wonderful.

Cons:
1. You can tell ""Woman Of The Year"" and ""Adam's Rib"" are among the first DVD's ever released - the films open with the old Turner logo. New digital transfers and new discs with the same types of bonus materials as more recent Warner catalog discs (a short subject, a cartoon, maybe a short retrospective) would have befitted these films very much and made this set truly an event, as opposed to merely recycling old discs.

2. Warner was only able to license one disc of the more recent 2-Disc set of ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner,"" which is a shame - the only bonus feature on the film disc of that set are celebrity introductions to the film. While I didn't expect the other disc to be licensed, it would have been nice if they'd been able to.

3. While Warner was kind enough to release separate discs for ""Keeper Of The Flame"" and ""The Sea Of Grass,"" they sadly didn't bother to do so for ""Without Love,"" meaning the only way to get that one is to either buy this set or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Katharine-Hepburn-100th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B000NJXG68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Katharine Hepburn 100th Anniversary Collection</a>. While both sets often go on sale for very reasonable prices, those simply needing to complete a collection still have to buy a big set to get this one film.

4. The bonus disc is merely a recycle of the exclusive ""Spencer Tracy Legacy"" disc from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Hepburn-The-Signature-Collection/dp/B0002Y4TJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy & Hepburn: The Signature Collection</a>. Now, this documentary absolutely belongs in this set, but I don't find it kosher that this set's only substantial bonus feature only focuses on one half of the pair. (Granted the other half is the force behind it, but I digress.) A new disc should have been authored with this documentary as well as the intensely fascinating Katharine Hepburn documentary ""All About Me."" Granted it's available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Philadelphia-Story-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0006Z2KXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Philadelphia Story (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;but it would have made a nice inclusion here and given us a good look at both screen legends.

All gripes aside, Warner Bros. really has given us fans of Tracy & Hepburn a great box set of ALL of their films, and any gripes one may have about lack of extras, old discs being reused, etc. pale in comparison to finally having a complete collection of their on-screen magic together. Hopefully this will lead to more sets like this in the future, with Warner licensing other titles from other studios.",1325462400,,5418,5.174657534246576

These two actors are phenominal together and these movies prove it. They are the reason we call these great films classics. This is one classy duo. They are, to me, one of the greatest teams to come out of Hollywood. They don't have great actors like these two in this day. These good looking transfers will be cherished for years to come!

2019745,5,B0001NBMAS,"This witty and entertaining Hepburn-Tracy romp is worth seeing not just for the stars but also for the amusing 1957 view it had of our future. One of the best characters is a massive early computer which beeps and hisses most expressively.

Tracy comes into Hepburn's life as some kind of geeky scientist-consultant type. Hepburn runs the research department for a major TV network. She and her staff of three ""gals"" are forever fielding phone calls for information which they then dig up in the vast paper archive. Hepburn is also being toyed with (hard to believe) by her on-again, off-again lover-boss who keeps threatening to marry her but never does.

Hepburn is at her madcap best, especially during a drunken, Christmas party I'd love to have been at (they knew how to party in those days). Tracy, who is a bit old for the leading man part, gives a more restrained performance but his utter decency comes right through.

The computer threatens to replace human researchers but Hepburn and her crew rally and quickly demonstrate the superiority of the human. No darned machine is ever going to replace them!

Wonder what they would have made of Google.",1323734400,,1158,4.833333333333333

Producer Joseph Mankiewicz promptly responded, ""Don't worry, Kate. he'll cut you down to size."" The chemistry between the two is evident from the very beginning.

In fact, all of the other titles aren't even remastered, just ported over from previous DVD releases.  The Kramer Collection edition of GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is presented, including all of its extras.  Likewise, the Fox edition of DESK SET includes all of its extras.  The previous Universal DVD release of STATE OF THE UNION, with no extras (as per original release) is also included.  The ""bonus"" disc, THE SPENCER TRACY LEGACY: A TRIBUTE BY KATHERINE HEPBURN, is the same program previously paired with FURY on an early WB DVD.

For non-die-hard fans who own previous editions of these films, Warner has kindly released SEA OF GRASS and KEEPER OF THE FLAME separately.  If you don't already have any of these films, this set is a great value.

As to the mention by a previous reviewer that these discs are not DVD-Rs, that is certainly true.  BUT, don't be discouraged by WB's DVD-R Archive Collection titles.  WB stands behind this format and will replace any disc that might become defective over time.  Current DVD-R discs should last in excess of decades.  I've had pressed DVDs go bad over time and NO DVD-Rs to do so.  Please don't deprive yourself of WB's classic library because of a fear of the DVD-R techology.  I'm afraid that it's the wave of the future, as many classic titles just don't sell in volume.

2019760,5,B0001NBMAS,"I've waited MANY years to see a boxed set of the film teamings of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Hepburn-the-Definitive-Collection/dp/B004K4FUT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy & Hepburn the Definitive Collection</a>, with all 9 of the features, the heartfelt Tracy biography, ""The Spencer Tracy Legacy"", narrated by Hepburn, and selected featurettes, geared to the time frame of individual films, certainly hits it out of the park! A quick overview of the features:

""Woman of the Year"" (1942): The pair's first teaming, after Hepburn's HUGE success in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Philadelphia-Story/dp/B0006Z2KXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Philadelphia Story</a>...She'd wanted Tracy in the role of the pragmatic, jaded reporter in the earlier film, but he was working, so she had to settle for Jimmy Stewart (who felt miscast, but won the Best Actor Oscar, anyway!) Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin wrote the script specifically for Tracy and Hepburn (he was a plain-spoken, savvy sports columnist; she was a high-brow, internationally-acclaimed political journalist), and the chemistry was electric from the first moment they shared onscreen, as he opened a door and glimpsed her beautiful legs...This classic comedy of opposites attracting still packs a wallop, nearly 70 years later! (5 stars out of 5)

""Keeper of the Flame"" (1942): Despite being two of the great dramatic actors of their generation, the Tracy/Hepburn pairings always worked better in comedies, probably because the dramas were never quite of the same caliber. This tale of the hidden fascist roots of a deceased national hero is similar, in form, to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Kane/dp/B00003CX9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Kane</a>, with Tracy as an investigative reporter uncovering the nastiness, and Hepburn as the widow, tortured by her husband's secret life and ambitions; despite George Cukor's considerable directorial skills, and the stars at their most glamorous (mercy, they are both beautiful!), the whole film seems a bit overwrought...(3 stars out of 5)

""Without Love"" (1945): A welcome return to romantic comedy for Tracy and Hepburn; he's a scientist concerned about high altitude's lack of oxygen, on pilots (a frequent theme in wartime films), she's a widow and brilliant assistant, with a house in overcrowded Washington; to avoid the public gossip of a single man and woman living together (despite both swearing no interest in romance), they arrange a platonic, 'loveless' marriage (my, how times have changed!) and, in working together, not surprisingly, love blooms. While the themes are dated, the pair simply glows, onscreen, and watch for some first-rate supporting performances by Lucille Ball and Keenan Wynn! (4 stars, out of 5)

""The Sea of Grass"" (1947): This long, quasi-western period drama of the conflict between free-spirit Hepburn, and her husband, intractable land baron Tracy, is more fun for who was involved than the end result (which is, truthfully, slow and more than a bit turgid; a better Tracy vehicle as a rich cattleman is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Lance/dp/B0007PALKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Lance</a>). Directing is young Elia Kazan, who would redefine edgy, realistic contemporary drama in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Waterfront/dp/B00003CXBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Waterfront</a>&nbsp;(here, directing a studio-shot, soft-focus WESTERN???) Tracy (or co-star Melvyn Douglas, another suitor) fathers a wild, undisciplined son by Hepburn, played by Robert Walker, one of the most gifted, kinetic, tragic young stars in Hollywood history, and he is dazzling, easily outshining poor Douglas! Another problem with the film: Tracy had just been critically panned in his return to the Broadway stage, in ""The Rugged Path"", and had fallen off the wagon in an epic bender that put him into the hospital, and made him nearly impossible to work with...All in all, a real curiosity piece...(2 1/2 stars out of 5)

""State of the Union"" (1948): A somewhat flat Frank Capra political comedy, lacking the sharp, decisive wit of his earlier, similarly-themed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-John-Doe/dp/B0043GAT5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">'Meet John Doe'</a>, with Tracy as a rather naive industrialist talked into running for the Republican Presidential nomination, and Hepburn as his estranged wife, brought in to improve his 'image'. A first-rate cast (including Angela Lansbury, Van Johnson, and Adolphe Menjou), but an uneven script, which sputters, occasionally. Hepburn was a last-second replacement for Claudette Colbert, whose cavalier attitude in walking out earned Capra's life-long venom. Despite the behind-the-scenes problems, the Capra-Tracy-Hepburn teamup still has some terrific moments, and a wonderful finale! (3 1/2 stars out of 5)

""Adam's Rib"" (1949): The BEST of all the Tracy/Hepburn teamings! A battle royale of the sexes, as conservative D.A. Tracy prosecutes a young woman (Judy Holiday, dazzling in her debut), defended by his wife (Hepburn, at her funniest). A fabulous script (by the stars' lifelong friends, Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon), and sharp direction by George Cukor raises still timely, relevant questions about sexual inequality in society, educating audiences with a smile, played to perfection by a flawless cast... (5 stars out of 5)

""Pat and Mike"" (1952): Tracy and Hepburn, reteamed with Cukor, Kanin, and Gordon, in another sparkling comedy; slow-speaking (but quick-witted) sports promoter Tracy hitches his star to a natural athletic phenom (Hepburn, who was actually every bit as gifted an athlete as her character!); in protecting her, and developing her skills, the pair gradually fall in love. A very 'Runyonesque' tale, with colorful characters (watch for young Charles Bronson in a bit role), this film is a real charmer! (5 stars out of 5)

""Desk Set"" (1957): Katharine Hepburn was the force behind this automation-themed comedy becoming a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle, as Tracy's career and personal life were going through some very hard times, and she knew working together was the best medicine; while the storyline is dated (a research department at a ficticious television network, headed by Hepburn, faces elimination by Tracy's super-computer), and perhaps too rigidly adheres to it's roots as a stage play, it does offer a very good cast (including Gig Young and Joan Blondell), bright, witty dialogue (by Phoebe and Henry Ephron), and the Tracy/Hepburn magic, which makes it a winner... (4 stars out of 5)

""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967): While it's place as relevant social commentary (with an interracial marriage theme) may be a bit too sugar-coated, the final teaming of Tracy and Hepburn, with superstar Sidney Poitier, and Hepburn's niece, Katharine Houghton, in her film debut, is a very, very special film. Spencer Tracy was dying, the years of alcoholism having destroyed his health, but he wanted one last chance to act (which both Hepburn and director/friend Stanley Kramer were determined to provide him); the major studios refused to insure him, however, and the pair had to agree to financially cover all losses, if Tracy passed away during production. He hadn't acted in front of a camera in over three years, his energy was erratic, and he could work, at most, only a few hours a day, in the studio (the outdoor sequence at the ice cream 'drive-in' was performed by doubles, in long shots, with the close-ups filmed indoors on a set). Tracy did, in fact, pass away just days after the film 'wrapped', but his performance was superb, with a decisive closing summation that is one of the finest pieces of acting in film history, earning him a final Oscar nomination (while he lost, Hepburn won, and considered the award as recognition to both of them). A beautiful, bittersweet farewell (5 stars out of 5)

Unfortunately, this is the most boring Tracy-Hepburn movie I've seen yet. And even though I knew it was going to happen, I didn't see the love and connection between the two until the very end. Maybe it was because I was asleep for part of it. But come on, it was all about Tracy answering phones and taking notes. Sumner was so low-key about everything I thought he had aspergers or something.

My favorite seen, however has to be when they were in the apartment together, just chillin', eating dinner in their bathrobes. I long to eat dinner in my bathrobe. If only my wife would let me.

2019764,5,B0001NBMAS,"For classic film fans, it doesn't get any better than the films featuring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, but the special magic was in the movies they starred in together.

This latest and greatest offering provides all of their movies in one package, two that haven't been released on DVD before. For fans who have been buying each of their films as they've been released, there is little reason to duplicate those purchases here, as the two remaining films are also now being released. This is, however, a wonderful boxed set for fans new to these amazing actors, or for others who only have one or two of their movies.

Tracy and Hepburn are truly iconic: their sparkle on screen was a chemistry that was not only acting but very, very real. They were a committed couple for decades, but because Tracy was married but separated, they never publicly acknowledged their relationship during his life time. Tracy was a Catholic back in the days when divorce was not an option, so he and his wife had a quiet separation, that was respected by the media, which never ""outed"" them. Hard to imagine in this day and age of the stalkarazzi!

In addition to their films, this boxed set includes a special tribute to Tracy that Hepburn made, in which she finally publicly discussed their private relationship. Hepburn only produced the film after Mrs. Tracy passed away, because she didn't want her to be embarrassed by the disclosure.

Hepburn describes when they first met, saying that she had made a quip to him about being taller than he was, to which he replied something like, ""Don't worry, I'll cut you down to size.""

This set includes Woman of the Year; Keeper of the Flame (first time on DVD); Without Love; The Sea of Grass (first time on DVD); State of the Union; Adam's Rib; Pat and Mike, which was written especially for them to star; Desk Set; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, about a white couple coming to grips with their daughter's engagement to a black man.

Tracy was very ill during the production of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, but by sheer force of his amazing personality he managed to finish the film. He died a very short time later. (Look for an unforgettable scene in which his character tells his 'wife' played by Hepburn, how much he loves her. Fans have long believed it was his on-screen TRUE love declaration to Hepburn, whose eyes brim with real tears as he talks.)

If you're a first-time viewer of these films, you owe it to yourself to buy this great collection. They are more than worth watching, they are worth owning and enjoying again and again.",1296000000,,2586,4.657894736842105

2019781,5,B0001NBMAS,"*** Warning - this is a total spoiler. ***

Released on May 1, 1957, Desk Set is an excellent portrayal of librarians.  Bunny Watson played by Katherine Hepburn is the head librarian in the research center of a broadcasting company.  She is depicted as a very intelligent and capable woman.  There are three other librarians that she supervises, and they too are represented in a positive light.  All are dynamic interesting people who are shown doing real reference work.

The premise of the story is that a computer is being introduced into the research department at the Federal Broadcasting Company.  Spencer Tracy's character, Richard Sumnar, is to spend a few months getting a feel for the library.  He wants to make sure that he designs the computer to fit the job.  The company president says not to discuss this with any of the librarians.  However, by lunch time Bunny knows who he is and what he does because of her outstanding reference skills.  Her quick wit and intelligence quickly impress Richard.

Richard becomes a part of the library's family.  Through a series of humorous events, he ends up in Bunny's apartment wearing a robe that she purchased for her boyfriend, Mike Cutler, after a rain storm.  He and Bunny have a lot of fun cooking and eating dinner.  Their enjoyment is interrupted, when Mike shows up.  He completely misinterprets the situation.  This pushes Richard and Bunny closer together, and Mike leaves for an extended business trip to Chicago.

Everything comes to its peak at the office Christmas party.  There is a proposal of sorts from Mike to Bunny, but he is upset by the fact that she does not immediately drop everything to be with him.  He storms off.  Throughout the course of the Christmas party, Bunny and the other librarians get drunk and have fun.  However, the office is sobered up quickly, when a woman from the lab, Ms. Warner, comes to rearrange the layout of the reference department.  The computer is to come the next day, and the librarians are worried that they will lose their jobs.

Everybody in the office is given a pink slip, when there is a glitch in the payroll computer.  The librarians believe that they have really been fired.  When the computer is brought online, they decide to out reference it.  Ms. Warner becomes very flustered with the hostile work environment, and she leaves the reference department.  After this occurs, Richard Sumnar tells the librarians that the computer is not supposed to replace them.  The goal was to free them up for more important things.  Richard states that the reference department is actually supposed to expand.  Once their positions are secured, Bunny is willing to use the computer as the tool it was intended to be.

Mike comes back after all of this to woo Bunny, but Richard proposes too.  She chooses Richard.  With this choice, the viewer has the tacit assumption that she will be able to continue to do her job.  When Mike had proposed, one of the reasons that she cited as to why she could not leave with him was that she did not want to give up her job or the girls.  Previously, a librarian had left the job to get married and have a family; they received a Christmas card from her.  Also, all of the librarians in the reference department are single.  Bunny had even mentioned to one of the Pat Castillo, another librarian, that they could ""move in together and keep cats,"" when they get older.

The movie Desk Set shatters many librarian stereotypes.  The end of the movie shows that librarians do not have to be single.  In addition to this, the viewer can see that librarians are smart vibrant people who have real responsibilities.  The movie shows that a librarian is so much more then somebody who puts books away.  They were friendly and personable; there was no glowering anti-social behavior or extreme shyness shown.  The librarians in this movie dress in neither a frumpy nor overtly sexual manner.  The only glaring stereotype that the movie did not address was that of gender.  All of the librarians were women, and it was expected that that would be the case.  Overall, Desk Set was a very progressive movie.",1262390400,,4143,4.738095238095238
2019782,4,B0001NBMAS,"Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn movies are fun to watch; they are great comedies that bring quality family entertainment. Some of their movies tackle social and domestic issues. In the movie Adam's Rib, the inequality of the law; the unwritten rule of husbands shooting adulterers (but not wives) is examined. The movie Pat and Mike deals with the success of women athletes in professional sports, and how some greedy male managers try to exploit them. In Desk Set, the story is about the effect of automation at work place and how it affects the jobs and lives of workers. You get to see a lot of lighter side of office environment.

When efficiency expert Richard Sumner (Spencer Tracy) is assigned to the research department of the Federal Broadcasting Company to evaluate work patterns, his eccentric behavior catches the imagination of researchers Bunny Watson (Katharine Hepburn), Peg Costello (Joan Blondell), Sylvia Blair (Dina Merrill) and Ruthie Saylor (Sue Randall). They begin to worry when Sumner informs Bunny that his mission is to improve the efficiency, but actually Mr. Azae (Nicholas Joy), the head of the network, approves a project to computerize the department and asks Richard to keep the project a secret.

Bunny admires a gown she purchases and all excited in the hope that Mike Cutler (Gig Young), her boss and suitor of seven years will invite her to a country club dance. However, circumstances prevent that from happening, and in the mean time Bunny start dating Richard. The date turns into business meetings for them as Bunny finds out that Richard is the inventor and patent holder of EMMARAC, an electronic brain. The women at research department get worried that their jobs will lost due to the machine, when they find out that half the payroll department gets pink slips after EMMARAC becomes the machine of the Payroll department.

On the eve of a big weekend, Mike break his date with Bunny because of a business trip to Chicago, and in the meantime on a stormy day, Smithers (Harry Ellerbe), the office gossip offers Richard and Bunny a ride and drops them at Bunny's apartment building. Bunny invites the soaked Richard in for dinner and gives him a robe to wear that she has bought as a Christmas gift for Mike. Mike's plane gets cancelled due to inclement weather and he visits Bunny's apartment and gets shocked to see Richard in robe. This is one of the funniest moments of the movie. However, later, at the office Christmas party, the research staff laments the fact that this will be their last office party. The air of congeniality is shattered at the research department when Miss Warringer (Neva Patterson), an assistant of Richard and a computer operator start working.  Due to an error of the machine entire staff gets pink dismissal slips including Richard. This is another hilarious moment and the movie takes a jab at the competence of a machine replacing people. The staff obviously sad begins to pack up and refuse to answer the phones, which forces Miss Warringer to deal with the onslaught of calls. Richard then explains that EMMARAC was never intended to replace the research department, but only to help them do their job, and the project was kept secret because of an impending merger with another network.

William Marchant's play Desk Set was based on an actual CBS research librarian, Agnes E. Law, though the film's shots of Rockefeller Center suggest NBC. In Marchant's play there was no romance between Richard Sumner and Bunny Watson, but screenwriters Henry and Phoebe Ephron added a romantic story line to capitalize on the enormous success of Tracy and Hepburn screen relationship. The socialite-heiress Dina Merrill made her film debut in this movie, and Joan Blondell offers an excellent performance as Bunny's sidekick Peg.

This movie is set around Christmas time and movie-critics never mention this. I believe any movie set in Christmas time deserved to be treated as movie worth watching during Christmas time. You get to feel and enjoy the joyous occasion. The festive spirit is reflected in the office, windows, and doors being decorated with Christmas wreaths, Christmas Carols in the background, Christmas party at work with office Santa Claus is a very happy occasion.

It was a revelation.  Since then I have graduated to watching it on DVD on my large screen color TV, and it continues to be a revelation.  I won't repeat all the accolades of previous reviewers - who DOESN'T love the scene on the freezing rooftop or the floating island on a rainy night while Tracy's shoes are cooking in the oven? - but there are lots of delightful lesser moments, such as when Hepburn despairs of getting married and suggests to Blondell that they live together and keep cats (Gertrude Stein, anyone?) or when the continuity person didn't do their job, and Hepburn leaves the office building holding flowers of one color, and steps outside with the color completely changed.
A big part of the charm of this film, of course, is the obvious and genuine affection between Hepburn and Tracy.  They truly enjoyed each other, and so do we.",1216857600,,1049,4.505263157894737

2019789,5,B0001NBMAS,"When I list my favorite film for each year, this is always on my list for 1957. I know I'm supposed to say ""Twelve Angry Men"" or ""Bridge over the River Kwai"", but I just find this film to be better. Hepburn and Tracy star in a very odd romantic comedy in which the leading man is a computer designer and the leading lady is head of the reference department at a major television network. Change the fear of automation that Tracy's computer brings to the fear of outsourcing and you have something very modern indeed. It is interesting to see the fear of being replaced by something cheaper existed for employees even 50 years ago. It's also interesting to see that Hepburn's character as well as her employees are all smart women who, in the 1950's, cannot hope to aspire to something greater than looking up information for the rest of the company. The romantic comedy is smart and very adult, and it's a shame more people haven't seen it. There really is romance after the age of 35, something you'd never know by watching the films of today.

The one real disappointment of this DVD is the commentary. There are two people commenting -  film historian John Lee and actress Dina Merrill who costarred in the film. John Lee seems to be reading his remarks and talks more about film history in general than the film specifically. Ms. Merrill talks about her personal experiences with the cast. I was really hoping for some extra or commentary about research departments as they existed in the 1950's or even something about the early electronic brains, such as the one that Tracy's character brings into the network research department. You get none of that. There is one other extra about fashions, but that is it. Usually commentary and extras on Fox classic films has been much better than this.",1215907200,,1798,4.650943396226415

My favorite scene is when it's raining and Tracy goes home with Hepburn. They are all cozy with a fire and fried chicken and floating island, only to be walked in upon by the wonderfully arrogant Gig Young. Sometimes I just watch this scene alone!

Kate leads the reference whiz kids, Tracy pioneers the scary machinery that threatens their jobs. Gig Young and Dina Merrill and Joan Blondell add sparkling supporting performances. So what's wrong? Well, compared to the Hepburn-Tracy pairings of earlier years, this one is overlong and has a script that sizzles only in spurts. One thing I've noticed, however, is that every time I see it (about four viewings now over the past 20 years or so) it gets more enjoyable.

Mr. Lee's commentary is more relevant to this particular picture, but sometimes inaccurate. The Fox Movietone News short, ""Designers Inspired For New Creations By Film 'Desk Set,'"" is fun. The collection of still is nice, but was letterboxed then surrounded by a filler background for some strange reason, which makes the photos very small on the screen. The theatrical trailer, with its craft editing, is very interesting because it seems VERY risque for its day, particularly where it leaves you with the impression Tracy has left his clothes in Hepburn's bedroom.

Tracy and Hepburn are terrific together (as usual) and there's not a moment lost in this outstanding comedy.

2019837,4,B0001NBMAS,"If you replace the constant use of the term ""automation"" with ""outsourcing"", this 1957 workplace-driven comedy would be quite a relevant tweak on corporate restructuring and office politics. As it stands now, it's a light piece of entertainment that benefits primarily from a smart screenplay by Phoebe and Henry Ephron (Nora's parents...must run in the family) and of course, the incomparable Tracy-Hepburn teamwork. It's not their best work, but fifteen years into their relationship, they achieve an easy, laser-sharp rapport here that makes the film easy to enjoy.

Efficiently directed by Walter Lang, the movie focuses its plot on the research department of a national TV network, the so-called Federal Broadcasting System. The four-woman staff is headed by the whip-smart Bunny Watson, who appears to possess a wealth of information and an unfailing memory for the smallest detail. They work like clockwork together in finding responses to often extremely trivial questions, but they do everything manually. Enter Richard Sumner, a befuddled man with a measuring tape and mismatched socks, who turns out to be a brilliant engineer hired by the network CEO to install an electronic brain called EMERAC. Designed to streamline the research process, the monolithic computer has the research staff understandably concerned about pending unemployment. Invariably, Bunny and Sumner start to recognize a mutual attraction through the awkwardness, and further complications arise with the presence of Mike Cutler, a rising network executive who has pompously kept Bunny on a leash for years.

As Bunny, Katharine Hepburn appears to be playing a variation of herself, which in this case, suits the role perfectly. By comparison, Tracy seems a bit tired as Sumner, except when interacting with Hepburn, whether unsuccessfully volleying brainteasers on a freezing rooftop, eating floating islands in their bathrobes, or canoodling between the second-floor bookshelves during the office Christmas party. A terrific supporting cast has been assembled starting with Gig Young in his typical role as the third wheel Mike, which he plays with enough sharp and smarmy aplomb to make Bunny's dilemma palpable. Joan Blondell expertly plays Bunny's stalwart sidekick Peg, and they achieve a genuine chemistry as they banter about the ""Mexican Avenue bus"".

Dina Merrill and Sue Randall (forever etched in my memory as Beaver's crush-worthy schoolteacher Miss Landers on ""Leave It to Beaver"") seem a bit too glamorous to be librarians, but they're both serviceable, while Neva Patterson plays EMERAC's coldly efficient ""mother"", Miss Warriner, to brittle perfection. Even though the sets are pure 1950's-style dcor, Leon Shamroy makes full use of the Cinemascope process to bring his color-saturated cinematography to the widescreen. The 2004 DVD comes with a commentary track by film historian John Lee, who provides interesting insight to the production, casting and stage-to-screen translation. Merrill provides some remembrances of her own, but her commentary is spotty and a bit self-serving. A vintage, minute-long newsreel on the film's costumes; a few trailers for other Fox films of the period; and a photo gallery complete the package.",1153267200,,3231,5.523232323232323
2019838,5,B0001NBMAS,"As with nearly all of the Hepburn/Tracy films, the joy for me of watching ""Desk Set"" is the very genuine rapport and affection that the two leads project toward one another. I happen to prefer this one over their other films together only because the supporting cast (including Gig Young and Joan Blondell) is superb and the entire enterprise has a very laid-back, relaxed air. It looks like it was fun to make, and throughout it cinema's most notable couple-and almost certainly its most talented-play beautifully off of each other's strengths. Like a well-worn but loving couple, they give each other room to maneuver and each has their moments to shine. It's not the world's most inventive script; all the subtext about Tracy being an efficiency expert and Hepburn's research team thinking he wants them all fired is much ado about not much. No, the reason to watch is to see the real spark between a great actor and a great actress who just happened to love each other in real life.

2019842,3,B0001NBMAS,"Of the nine films Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn made together I have, as of now, seen four; ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", ""Pat and Mike"", and ""Woman of the Year"". So far this is my favorite.

 Now I wouldn't go as far as some and call this one of the great comedies of all time, but I would say this is an enjoyable funny that has at least two very, very funny scenes, which I will get to in a moment.

 The movie was directed by Walter Lang (""Can-Can"", ""The Jackpot"", and ""Moon Over Miami"") and was written by Phoebe and Henry Ephron (parents to Nora).

 Tracy stars as Richard Sumner a sort of efficiency expert who is sent to over look Bunny Watson's (Katherine Hepburn) research department. What kind of company she works for exactly I'm not sure. And soon Bunny and her co-workers Joan Blondell (Peg), Dina Merrill (Sylvia) and Sue Randall (Ruthie) become anxious trying to figure out what exactly Sumner is doing there and will it cost anyone their job.

 There is also a side story going on about Bunny and a man she has been seeing for seven years Mike (Gig Young) who has yet to ask the big question, but Bunny remains devoted to him anyway.

 I would have preferred if the movie had focused more on the relationship in the office between Tracy and Hepburn, but that's okay.

 Now for those two funny scenes. The highlight of this film includes an ""evaluation"" scene between Racy and Hepburn having lunch. Their timing and chemistry is amazing. The scene reminds me of the gin rummy scene in ""Born Yesterday"". The other highlight includes an ""apartment"" scene with Tracy getting caught in the rain staying over at Hepburn's place. Soon complications set in, and I will not reveal them here. But these two scenes are probably the best in the film.

 I also like the film's message. Technology by itself is not perfect. I'm totally against all these advancement in the field, which is funny considering I'm using a computer right now. But I liked the film's cynical look at technology.

 Bottom-line Enjoyable Tracy/Hepburn comedy that has two very funny scenes which demonstrates how great these two people were and what amazing chemistry they had. Check it out.",1115251200,,2178,4.6475195822454305

Short on extras, but a few goodies, like a newsreel about the fashions the film inspired and a commentary by Dina Merril and John Lee (?) who I assume is a historian as I certainly don't know him. But, the film is the thing and it is wonderful.",1104451200,,692,4.149253731343284

However, the company sends in Richard Sumner to improve the division's perfomance, and suddenly everyone's afraid they're going to be replaced by a very large computer(aka EMERAC).  Bunny's boyfriend, on the other hand, is afraid that he's going to get replaced by Sumner.

And in honor of this great movie finally being released in all of it's widescreen glory, I am cut and pasting my review for the video version here below:

""Like Floating Island...Delicious!""

  The smart dialogue, the gorgeous fashion, the way you want to kick Gig Young in the teeth...I wish more modern comedy could be this clever.  My two favorite scenes are the rooftop lunch quiz and the rainy evening misunderstanding. As usual you never think Tracy is acting, he's so real. And Hepburn's Miss Watson (her name a inside-joke nod to the founder of IBM -Thomas J. Watson) is a character you root for to blow off egotistical beau Mike. Another bonus is the Sumners snooty EMIRAC assistant, Miss Warringer-whose come-uppance couldn't be better. I want a brown coat like Bunny's!

 Thank goodness this is finally out on DVD and WIDESCREEN!  It's completely enjoyable now without the distractions of pan and scan!

2019846,3,B0001NBMAS,"This is one of Kate and Spencer's later efforts - post MGM, pre-""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" and it generally lacks in the chemistry that most of thier work at MGM had in spades. Tracy's a method's engineer who's assigned to make the daily operation of a television station more efficient. Of course he's bound to butt heads with researcher, Bunny Watson (Hepburn). Unlike most Tracy/Hepburn movies, in which their love for one another is never in question, on this occasion,Gig Young is inexplicably and needlessly thrown into the mix as Bunny's boyfriend. But it's the old Hepburn/Tracy's stardust and magic that keeps this otherwise deadly boring film afloat.
TRANSFER: Desk Set is at last presented in its original Cinemascope 2:35:1 aspect ratio and it is anamorphically enhanced to take full advantage of 16:9 displays. Although colors can be rich, vibrant and bold, flesh tones have an uncanny pasty look in certain scenes and a reddish/pinkish overcast in others. There are instances where dirt, film grain and age related artifacts crop up throughout this print. Also, black levels tend to be weak in certain scenes. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some pixelization but the print is generally smooth looking. The audio, as with all Cinemascope films of the period, is vintage stereo and presented at a reasonable listening level.
Extras: Fox is genuinely inconsistent in the extra content they provide for their ""Studio Series"" titles. If you recall, ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" contained a 70 min. documentary while ""The Inn of The Sixth Happiness"" contained only an audio commentary track. On this occasion we get an audio commentary and some truncated movietones junk that is short, boring and generally slapped together as an afterthought. Not what I would expect from any series dubbed, ""Studio Series"".
BOTTOM LINE: If you're a die hard Tracy/Hepburn fan than this is a must have. But it's not one of their best or even one of their mediocre. It's just big on...well, being big and short, unfortunately, on entertainment!",1083628800,,2050,5.068047337278107

I'll go even further than that review and say that Desk Set is the BEST film with Spence and Kate. And don't forget the great Gig Young doing his perfect second banana routine, which has already delighted us in so many other films. They didn't hide behind so many physical gags or the safer facade of black and white. Instead they acted out the script in glorious full color widescreen and stereo, no less.
And did Fox drop the ball in giving us the proper widescreen version of this classic? No, they did not! The studio came through for us (which is more than we can usually say about studios) and put it out in widescreen! And they even added some actress commentary for good measure. Yes, it's been a long 9-year wait, since DVDs first came out in 1995, but it's here now, at least.
And what a great modern plot Desk Set has: an independent woman (instead of a cloying playtoy), a job for that woman as a research expert, (instead of the usual secretary trying to date her boss), a strong leading man but one with a sense of humor (instead of the usual he-man tough guy). And all smack in the middle of the early revolution of COMPUTERS!
The man vs. machine concepts in this film will reverberate down through the ages. Plus it has a great romantic plot, too. This film has everything! Many people say they love to see a well-restored 1957 Chevy, but I'll take this well-restored 1957 Desky instead!",1083542400,,1670,4.533112582781457
2019868,5,B0001NBMAS,"Directed by Walter Lang (1896-1972) and based upon a play written originally by William Marchant (1923-1995), the 1957 comedy ""Desk Set"", starring the legendary duo of Spencer Tracy (1900-1967) and Katharine Hepburn (1907-2003), is a charming and hilarious film.  Its story revolves around the lives of people working for a large corporation that is starting to modernize with 1950's computer technology.  Spencer Tracy plays the seemingly unsociable Richard Sumner, who is a ""methodology engineer"" (computer specialist) that is hired by the company's president, Mr. Azae (Nicholas Joy), to install computers in several departments.  Katherine Hepburn plays the very sociable Bunny Watson, who is in charge of the company's research & records department and has a photographic memory.  She has three assistants working for her: Peg Costello (Joan Blondell, 1906-1979), Sylvia Blair (Dina Merrill) and the aspiring Ruthie Saylor (Sue Randall, 1935-1984). For seven years, Bunny has dated a company employee, Mike Cutler (Gig Young, 1913-1978), who is very interested in moving up the corporate ladder.  When word gets out that one of the departments that Richard Sumner will be modernizing is Bunny's records & research department, Bunny and her staff fear the worst; but Bunny's relationship with Richard becomes quite interesting.
Other memorable characters in the film include the old lady (Ida Moore, 1882-1964), Richard Sumner's assistant Miss Warriner (Neva Patterson) and Smithers from the legal department (Harry Ellerbe, 1901-1992).  Memorable scenes in the film include the rooftop conversation, the Christmas party, the rainstorm, Bunny's apartment, and the scenes with the computer.  Overall, I rate ""Desk Set"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend the film to everyone.

Available for some time in Asia, it's scandalizing that OUR OWN classic cinema takes years to be released here on DVD!
Featuring the incomparable talents of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in their prime, this sparkling movie enjoyed the lively direction of Walter Lang.
Tracy plays a computer engineer, Richard Sumner, hired as a consultant to computerize the research department of a TV network. The research department head, Bunny Watson, played by Hepburn, hasn't been told the specifics of the project and erroneously believes the computer being installed, EMERAC, will replace her employees. Sparks soon fly between Tracy and Hepburn not just regarding the workplace situation, but also romantically.
The two stars get terrific support by a first-rate cast that includes Joan Blondell, Gig Young, and a youthful Dina Merrill.
While many critics fail to list this movie as one of the best outings by film's dynamic duo, I find it endlessly entertaining and great fun. I love the witty dialog and the fantastic chemistry between Tracy and Hepburn. The scene at Bunny's apartment when Sumner ends up there because of a rain storm features vintage Tracy and Hepburn repartee that easily equates to one of the best encounters ever captured on film for any of their movies.
It is also a facinating look at the future computer age as envisioned by the 1950s film industry. The computer marvel created for the story is as big as a living room!
Hopefully, this release with lead to the release of the remainder of the Tracy-Hepburn catalog on DVD, and the catalogs of both of those legendary performers' independent projects. I only wish the amazing Heburn had lived to see these fine, memorable films released on DVD.

2019873,5,B0001NBMAS,"I hesitate to write this review, since ""Desk Set"" is not merely my favorite Hepburn-Tracy movie, but also my favorite movie.  Moreover, it includes my favorite scene in the movies, the ""scene on the roof.""  Hence, I ain't objective.  The roof scene, in which Tracy gives Hepburn what is essentially an I.Q. test, and Hepburn aces it, is not merely brilliant Tracy/Hepburn (told you I was biased), but a classic example of the jousting that occurs when a very smart guy meets a very smart woman.  Inevitably -- because this is Tracy and Hepburn -- Richard Sumner admires and, eventually, falls madly in love with Bunny Watson, who dumps her long-time, self-centered, unappreciative boyfriend in order to marry him.
Everything about this film is delightful, from Tracy's cautioning Hepburn, ""Never assume!"" before relating the famous ""detective"" problem (see title of this review), to the office jokes between the legal department and the librarians, the floating-island dessert, Tracy's bongo drums, and the rousing climax in which, as the new library computer spews out all 87 verses of the poem, ""Curfew,"" instead of data about the island of Corfu (having been mis-programed by a female in god-forbid -- a suit), Hepburn theatrically recites the poem, rounding off each verse with a resounding, ""Curfew will not ring tonight!""
""Should Bunny Watson marry Richard Sumner?"" Tracy types into his computer.  ""I thought that you said that it couldn't evaluate?"" asks Hepburn.  ""I programmed in the answer,"" Tracy responds.

2019875,5,B0001NBMAS,"There are many cinematic moments I cherish, but one of my favorites has to be Katharine Hepburn murdering ""Night and Day"" to Spencer Tracy's bongo accompaniment in ""Desk Set."" The movie--about the love and war between computer expert Tracy and TV-network fact-checker Hepburn when she fears Tracy is trying to replace her department with a massive 1950s electronic brain--is the purest froth. But it never puts a foot wrong, and retains the same inspired level of delicate amusement throughout its running length--no easy achievement with farce. (The movie's ""electronic brain"" is in itself a hoot to behold for audiences in 2002!) In a way, ""Desk Set"" is an inversion of James Thurber's great comic story ""The Catbird Seat,"" with the man instead of the woman as the efficiency expert and with love triumphing in the end (the latter a most un-Thurberish development). It's redundant by now to praise Tracy and Hepburn, the smoothest old pros in cinematic history; suffice it to say that the superb supporting cast--including Gig Young, Joan Blondell, Dina Merrill, and the nameless old lady who dithers wordlessly through the action--is a match for them.",1039737600,,1154,5.1436170212765955

Tracy and Hepburn made a separate career (as if either one needed to) by playing off one another in a series of films. This one is outstanding. The repartee between the two of them was never better. I absolutely adored the rooftop lunch scene where, of course, Tracy tries to top her with brainteasers, but not only does she figure them all out instantly, she's always one step ahead of him. Usually, I can find something in a film that is overlooked by others. In this film, it's the obvious age difference between Hepburn and her love interest, Gig Young. He seems much too young (no pun intended) for her. But still, she IS Kathryn Hepburn. So I guess that makes it OK. There is a reference to what the Tracy character did during WWII.

2019880,5,B0001NBMAS,"Hepburn gives us another wonderful performance as Bunny Watson, head of a reference department at a television broadcast company.  Spencer Tracy turns in one of his classic gruff, intelligent and somewhat absent-minded performances as Richard Sumner who has been hired to computerize the company on the eve of a big merger.  Thanks to a deftly demonstrated grapevine within the company, nothing of his purpose can be revealed, and much of the film's humor derives from the wild speculation that arises as a result.  Bunny, who is involved with her boss, Mike Cutler, is immediately interested in Sumner, partly out of curiosity (Is he there to make her obsolete?) and partly because the  sparks just fly between them in classic exchanges such as this:
Bunny:  I don't smoke, I only drink champagne when I'm lucky enough to get it, my hair is naturally natural, I live alone...and so do you.
Sumner:  How do you know that?
Bunny:  Because you're wearing one brown sock and one black sock.
You know they're made for each other, that Mike isn't the right man for Bunny and never was, but Bunny's ambivalence over what she supposes Sumner's job to be threatens any possibility of romance between them, and the prying, meddling and jumping-to-conclusions being done all around them only make the situation that much more difficult, and that much funnier.
Joan Blondell as Bunny's sexy, funny best friend just shines here with her share of the best lines.  Even the bit parts will make you smile.  The writing credits include Henry and Phoebe Ephron, parents to Amy, Delia and Nora Ephron.  (It's nice to see that their lively sense of the absurd has been transmitted to another generation.)  Everything in this film is deftly done; I can't think of a wrong note or a misstep through the entire 103 minute run, and in fact scenes like the dinner at Bunny's apartment or the office Christmas party with the hilarious ""Mexican avenue bus"" exchange should have you falling off your couch with laughter.

8015087,5,B0001NBMAS,"I watch this movie once every few months.  I've worked in offices most of my life and this reminds me so much of different people I have known throughout the years.  Gig Young as the upwardly mobile executive who will use and emotionally abuse if it will get him ahead is a ""fixture type"" in most companies.  And, Spencer Tracy is just absolutely classic as a brilliant science guy who has never gotten around to the opposite sex until he meets his intellectual match in Katharine Hepburn.  This film just never gets old to me.....",1513987200,,531,4.557894736842106

Hot Toasty Rag, October 30, 2017

Theyre at it again! In their eighth screen pairing, real-life sweethearts Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy team up in a fast-paced battle of the sexes comedy. As usual, they both have forceful personalities, and as usual, they bicker and try to prove their points for an hour or two while falling in love.

In Desk Set, their workplace is dominated by the introduction of computer technology. Theres a hilarious line in the film Blast from the Past in which Brendan Fraser asks incredulously, You have a computer? In your house? In the 1950s, computers were new, humongous, and scary, so you're going to have to wrap your head around that nostalgic trivia before settling down to watch this flick. While lots of Tracy-Hepburn movies are still applicable today, this isn't really one of them. If you love their pairings, feel free to add this one to your list, but its not really their best. Its a little more dated than Woman of the Year and isn't as endearing as Adams Rib, so you might be better off sticking to your favorites.",1509321600,,1085,4.675392670157068
