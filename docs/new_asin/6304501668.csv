892992,5,6304501668,"***Spoilers Ahead, Most Definitely*** I bought this movie because it was only $1 on VHS at the thrift store. I wasn't expecting all that much to be honest with you but I enjoyed First Kid WAY more than I ever expected to. First Kid was a great movie, it was worth the $1 & then some. I can't think of 1 complaint I had with it. They goofed when Luke was on house arrest. Instead of putting the bracelet on his ankle, they put it on his wrist. Not a complaint, just something I noticed & found weird. I wonder if it was done on purpose or what? I wish I knew why they did that. Another thing I found weird/strange is the shooting at the end. This is the 1st Disney movie I've seen where somebody gets shot. Anyways....... I don't have any particular favorite part of the movie that stands out for me because I enjoyed First Kid from start to finish. Sinbad & Brock Pierce worked well together. In fact, the whole movie worked. It's a very heartwarming movie that you can enjoy by yourself or together with the whole family. I'f you ever get a chance to watch it, check it out. I got a copy of First Kid on VHS & now I want it on DVD as well",1482624000,,1139,4.089285714285714

893642,4,6304501668,"I bought this DVD along with Houseguest (also starring Sinbad) and have really enjoyed it.  First Kid is witty and yet has a good message as well.  Brock Pierce plays Luke, the 13 year old son of Paul Davenport, the President of the United States.  Some would consider him a brat but the truth is he is smothered by his handlers and his life changes when Sam Simms (Sinbad) becomes his new bodyguard.  The adventures start rolling from there as sinbad give him advice on life and ladies, both having funny consequences.  He takes a genuine interest in the kid, even though no one else wants the job.  I don't want to give away the plot, but you should see this one.  It's funny.

Sinbad was hilarious as Agent Sam Simms who is assigned to protect the President's rebellious son, Luke. Simms helps Luke with his bullies, get the girl, and how to dance and form a friendship. It has a few dark moments for being a Disney movie, but still a decent movie for the family. I would recommend FIRST KID!!!",1319068800,,417,4.5

What is coencidental is they both got out of the military the same way. I loved the story line in this movie, and for a kid's movie it had some suspence to it. Anyway, Buy this CD and see for yourself how much fun a secret service agent can have on the job.

893721,5,6304501668,"Luke Davenport is the 13 year old son of Paul Davenport, the President of the United States, and first lady Linda Davenport. Ill tempered Agent Woods is the secret service agent in charge of Luke. Woods is fired after mistreating Luke in front of media cameras. Woods is then replaced by former boxer Sam Simms, who won a boxing title in 1977. Sam is eager to take the job-even though no one else wants it. Everyone thinks that Luke is just a brat when the only thing Luke wants is to just fit in and be like every other kid at his school, the Georgetown Academy. Sam almost gets fired when Luke gets decked at school by school bully Rob MacArthur. This is when Sam decides to use his boxing expertise to teach Luke how to fight. Luke has his eyes on classmate Katie Warren, but so does Rob. Katie agrees to go with Luke to an upcoming school dance, so Sam teaches Luke how to dance. Rob is also at the dance, but this time when Rob tries to deck Luke, Luke turns the tables and decks Rob. Sam is then fired for taking Luke to the dance without permission, although Luke had the permission of his parents, but secret service chief Morton didn't want Luke leaving the White House grounds while Luke's parents were on the campaign trail. Luke runs away anyway to meet a friend that he has been chatting on the internet with. The meeting is set to take place at a local mall,where Luke discovers that his secret friend is a now psychotic Woods, who blames Luke for his firing and wants revenge on Luke, but not if Sam can help it. This movie is supposed to focus on the kid, but Sinbad totally steals the movie, and does a terrific job. This movie is worth your two hours.",1266969600,,1669,4.318471337579618

893725,4,6304501668,"Sam Simms (Sinbad) is an unorthodox Secret Service agent.  The Secret Service assigns Agent Simms to protect the President's son, Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce of ""Might Ducks""), code named Prince.  Luke has managed to dispose of several previous Secret Service agents by driving them crazy, including Agent Woods (Timothy Busfield of ""Thirtysomething"" and ""The West Wing"").

The movie tries to portray Luke as a child ignored by his famous mother and father and unable to have a normal childhood.  Though I empathize with Luke a little, he also generally acts wimpy.  However, thirteen-year-old Luke has stirrings of normality as he gains a huge crush on classmate Katie Warren (Erin Williby in her final role) and has a run-in with the class bully.  After the run-in with class bully Rob (Zachery Ty Bryan), Luke and Agent Simms begin to bond, and this movie really takes off.

Much of the movie is humorous, as it was intended to be.  Most of the humor works, making this movie generally enjoyable.  Sinbad steals the show, as you might expect.  Sinbad mixes slapstick and one-liners that only occasionally clunk.  Sinbad makes Luke Davenport look good and sparks life into the plot.

As with many Disney movies of this type, there are serious undertones.  The movie becomes most serious near the end when Luke Davenport runs away from the White House and encounters a life threatening situation.  Secret Service agents are in a panic as they try to locate the President's son.  Fortunately, Agent Simms, just fired from the Secret Service for aiding Luke in going to a school dance, has a way of finding Luke that only Agent Simms knows about.  The end of this movie is nicely plotted and enjoyable to watch.

I enjoyed watching Sinbad in this movie.  Sinbad's comedy was generally fun, and he handles himself well.  Most of the cast did very well.  I would have replaced Luke Davenport with another actor, or would have had him perform with more confidence in school.  Luke Davenport ran rings around the Secret Service and yet he was unable to keep from embarrassing himself.  The plot was agreeable, with an action ending that provided a nice capstone to the comedy.  There is some mild violence that generated a PG rating, but this movie should be suitable for most family members down to about age 7 or 8.  Enjoy!",1156982400,,2321,4.83248730964467
893726,5,6304501668,"Just seeing the name of this great movie brings back a great memory from 1996. At the age of 18, even though I was officially an adult, thanks to being a member of the Fox Kids Club in my area as a kid, I was able to win free tickets to see a prescreening of First Kid because I knew Sinbad's name. My girlfriend on one side and a good friend on the other, we had to travel an hour to get to the theater where the prescreening took place, but if there was ever a movie worth an hour's travel, First Kid is the one! I still remember the loud chorus of laughter, particularly when Sinbad got the bully back with the huge spitwad, and the rest of the movie had no lack of great moments either. First Kid is delightfully funny, but at the same, it has a lot of feel good moments to it, and I truly feel for anyone who hasn't seen it. Great music, great times, great entertainment for all! With First Kid, you just can't go wrong!",1122768000,,925,4.060109289617486

Sinbad stars as a Secret Service agent assigned to look after the Luke, the juvenile son of the president of the United States.  Sinbad attends grammar school with Luke, to ensure the Luke's safety.
Anyway, several of the other kids pick on Luke because they think Luke is a snobby punk.  E.g., in one of the scenes, Zachary Ty Bryan (from Home Improvement) shot a spitball through a straw, hitting Luke in the head.  However, Sinbad got even with Zachary - he later shot a huge spitball (about as big as a mini-basketball) through a huge tube at Zachary.  It hit Zachary in the face, nearly knocking him out of his seat!  I almost lost it when I watched that scene!  It was gut-bustingly funny!

893784,5,6304501668,"I just love FIRST KID, and anyone who didn't like the film must not have a good sense of humor. Sinbad, as usual, plays it totally cool and calm in just about every movie he does. And Brock Pierce is also excellent (and cute) as the President's son - the First Kid. Brock Pierce plays Luke Davenport. Luke has trouble making friends because he's  the President's son and everybody in his high school doesn't like him especially because they think he's a snob. Zachary Ty Bryan (former ""Home Improvement"" star), plays Rob, a kid who's jealous of Luke so he starts to bully him! Sinbad plays a Secret Service Agent, Sam Simms, who's assigned to protect Luke, even though he wants to protect the President himself, and Luke is known by the Secret Service to be quite a troublemaker, even though Simms ends up teaching Luke how to face his problems and stand up for himself. A really good movie - one that everybody can enjoy and a movie nobody will find offensive in any way...no real violence, either (except maybe the ""harrassment"" from the bully and the bad guy who tries to kidnap Luke - Luke's ex-Secret Service guard who tried to hurt him and got fired because of it).

This is a  great movie for families, and in a world where violence and strong  languange seem 'flagrante vous etu fei', isn't this enough to warrant  purchasing this awesome film? The answer, surprisingly, is perhaps.  I give  it five stars, despite the obvious four stars I gave it before I wrote  this.
