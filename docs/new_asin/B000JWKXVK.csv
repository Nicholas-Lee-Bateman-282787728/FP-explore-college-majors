I blew out my knees shooting this film, and had to have 5 operations and spent about 18 months in therapy.  That is the painful part.  The wonderful part was the bonding with cast and crew in the attempt to create something that could entertain and challenge people to think about things that matter most in life.  And the most wonderful of all is if - even all these years later, this movie can inspire or encourage you or motivate you to make a difference with your life.  If it did that, all the sacrifices were worth it.  Enjoy!  Rick",1503187200,,715,4.2835820895522385

And believe me, mostly that is mostly NOT what is being offered, as severe moralizing rarely goes together with cute, it seems! Anyways, Jay Roberts Jr, who apparently appears in ""Christian"" and vampire movies as well, is here showing that cute and cool can be religious hip. He is sooooooo cute. He finds Jesus while skiing. Apparently being around people rich enough to ski is a crucible that brings on religious conviction for such cuties, with the help of moralizing friends. He actually takes time out from the slopes the query about the bible, with terrific hair. How cute!",1337904000,,705,4.693548387096774
8153489,4,B000JWKXVK,"Usually I think ""Christian"" movies are cheesy, but this one was actually pretty good. It's not a big budget movie and the quality isn't like a block buster movie, but the message, story and such are good. I was also surprised how the characters all play roles that present many common objections, stereo types and struggles of both Christians and non Christians and the story line is believable. In other words the interactions the actors have with each other are just like real friends. I felt like I was hanging out with my friends in the movie. I'm not sure I will buy the movie, but it was a good one to watch and I would say it is one to watch at least once. It would be great for a youth group to watch.",1295568000,3,709,4.2592592592592595
