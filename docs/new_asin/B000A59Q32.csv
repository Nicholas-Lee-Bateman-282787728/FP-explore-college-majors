And Edward Woodward was barely in it at all. I've read that ""Bloodsuckers"" was a troubled production. It shows. That is likely the reason why the film is so confusing & incoherent. There are way too many characters to keep track of, and some very badly staged fight scenes. I enjoyed briefly seeing the 3 stars, but their scenes lasted only minutes. 90% of the story & acting were at a pretty low level. I love British horror, but this is just abysmal. Actually boring. I guess I liked the Greek & British locations. And Cushing was of course good in his scenes. For him I'll move it from the one star it deserves, to two. But really, I found it to be a confusing mess. Oh, and don't be fooled by the title. No vampires!",1393286400,2,877,4.289156626506024
8074536,3,B000A59Q32,"An Oxford scholar (Patrick Mower), doing research in Greece, is abducted by a group of ""swingers"" who introduce him to LSD, orgies, and other things. The leader of the group (Imogen Hassall) gets him addicted to sex & drugs and has him completely in her power. Two friends join forces with a British colonel (Patrick Macnee) to bring him back and discover that the leader is a modern day vampire. During the rescue attempt, she is killed and Mower is taken back to England where he seems to recuperate. Cushing plays an academic who wants Mower to marry his daughter and succeed him as head of the college. Also putting in an appearance is Edward Woodward (THE WICKER MAN) as an occult expert who warns the two friends that vampirism is a ""sexual perversion"" and to ""keep your eyes open"". The last sequence in the movie features a truly bizarre ending which looks like it was added later.

The tortured history of the movie is a lot more interesting. Shot in 1970 as INCENSE FOR THE DAMNED, the director Robert Hartford-Davis (CORRUPTION) ran out of money, had the film taken out of his hands, and then asked that his name be removed from the credits (it was). It was released in the U.K. two years later as FREEDOM SEEKERS and later retitled for American drive-ins in 1976 as BLOODSUCKERS. Since it was unfinished it needed to have some voiceover narration to link some segments together. The bulk of the first half takes place on Cyprus with great location shooting while Cushing and Edward Woodward's scenes were shot separately and then edited into the mix. Considering all of this, the film is a lot better than it should be and manages to conjure up a few worthwhile moments. This Redemption DVD is in better shape than the old SOMETHING WEIRD disc but the film probably never looked great to begin with.",1383523200,,1810,4.65625
8074537,3,B000A59Q32,"This 1971 quasi-vampire flick starts in quasi-documentary style with a voiceover from a British government official explaining how he is sent to Greece to help out a prominent Oxford scholar who has gotten himself into legal problems. It transpires that the young man has been hanging with a group of hedonistic, drug-abusing pagans. It's never made entirely clear why the governments of two countries are so anxious to overlook the young man's misdeeds, but apparently family connections count for a lot. There's a lot of washed-out, travelog-style photography of the heroes pursuing the hapless libertine across the Grecian countryside. Patrick Macnee supplies a welcome dose of class as a local British diplomat and also has a chase scene on donkeys, which is a bit offbeat. The fight scenes are totally unbelievable in a 60's TV drama kind of way. Back home in England, Peter Cushing commands the screen as the young man's oppressive father-in-law to be, and a young Edward Woodward supplies some quasi-anthropological commentary about sexual hangups. There are some hints that the source novel had an earnest message about how superstition results from repression; the image of the hydra is invoked as a symbol for the lure of the irrational, and how it rebounds from all attempts to limit it like a hydra growing a new head. Overall, this is not actually a good movie, but watchable for genre addicts. SPOILER ALERT: Questions to ask at the end are: Was there any actual vampirism, or only a cult of blood fetishists? And in the final scene, have the protagonists themselves fallen prey to the kind of superstitious hysteria that they've been trying to fight?  If so, then the ending changes from the traditional ""good-triumphs-over-evil"" to the more modern and disturbing ""but-evil-always-returns-anyway.""",1347840000,2,1812,5.184300341296928
