6414173,5,B00KC63X10,"Christian Walker presents a stunningly believable performance of a gay man, and being from Tennessee, Christian is aware of the prejudice that exists towards gays in the South. Those who rate this movie poorly do not understand the truth behind the story, and have never been to a gay pride march in Tennessee where there may only be 12 people in a small town parade. I love the movie for its entertainment value, and I thank the director and the producer for educating the country on Southern experience!",1425513600,5,505,4.75

6414180,1,B00KC63X10,"Not every gay-themed film has to be a masterpiece.  However, it also doesn't have to do such a disservice to the audience it was made for.  This one is a real stinker.",1408147200,10,167,4.1875
