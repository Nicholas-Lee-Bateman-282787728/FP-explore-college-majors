1964768,4,B00011CYMK,"This movie was about a law called ""Alienation Of Affection"" which shows how to get even with mistresses and philanderers who deliberately break up other peoples marriages. In this case, it was about a secretary named [Lynne Cox], and an insurance salesman named [Joe Hutelmyer], who ended up having an alleged affair for three years. At the insurance company where they worked, all their co-workers found out, and Joe's wife, Dot found out through info of a [P.I.] (suggested by a friend of Dot's), and also from the co-workers. So, as a result, [Joe and Lynne] were thrown out of the company. Dot then sued Joe for divorce. She still wanted to get even with Lynne, so she heard about a law called ""Alienation Of Affection"", and sued Lynne for that, and prevailed. She became an instant celebrity receiving phone calls for interveiws on talk and news shows. Eventually in the end, she and Joe agreed to share custody of their two boys, and she also worked with her lawyer on helping other people whose marriages were ruined in the same way.
This law is very helpful in getting even with mistresses and philanderers who ruin other peoples lives.",1143590400,16,1144,4.7537688442211055

1964773,5,B00011CYMK,This movie was awesome!  I loved the ending.  This is the way life to be in reality instead of people breaking up other people's homes and walking away Scott free.  I highly recommend it to any woman who's man has ever cheated on her and to those who's husbands haven't cheated as well.,1415750400,,286,4.3584905660377355
1964774,4,B00011CYMK,"This was a very interesting movie in that probably hardly anyone realizes that this law is on the books in many states.  I think it was important for Dot, as it would be for many women in her situation, to have a jury say that what Lynn did was wrong.  A woman in her situation has no dignity left, people pity her and she will continue to feel like a victim the rest of her life.  If she can just get her dignity back, let the world know that her marriage was not in trouble before this happened and that it was a deliberate act by that woman to take her husband that caused the breakup of her marriage.  I'm glad to see a movie made about this case.  My personal opinion is that if Lynn wanted to steal somebody's husband it was a mistake to do it in South Carolina where the old values are still entrenched in society.  It was a good movie and I enjoyed it.  I do think that all the scenes in the cafe were overdone.  A straight telling of the story might have been more effective.  The scenes in the cafe almost lowered the film to comedy status.",1407974400,2,1050,4.107843137254902
1964775,5,B00011CYMK,"I have always loved this movie. It's crazy-salacious! Being a secretary/adminstrative assistant, I see a lot of going ons in the office. And this movie fits right in. I have added it to my ""office-crazy-moments"" collection: The Temp, 9 - 5, Working Girl, The Devil Wears Prada, Office Space and Clockwatchers. A great movie-marathon!",1402531200,4,333,5.185185185185185

1964783,5,B00011CYMK,This movie is excellent in many ways.  A good wife and good mother and the other woman. True story and it should happen more often.  The wife had a point to make and she certainly made it.,1369353600,2,188,4.054054054054054
1964784,5,B00011CYMK,"I love this movie!!! The storyline was well scripted and portrayed. Dot was a faithful and dutiful wife & mother of two, then comes the shock of her life when her husband comes home and tells her that he leaving her, I was floored. Then she found out what happened, why & for how long... she hit the war path after that and rightly so. She sought justice from both parties and got it. Park Overall nailed this character. Kudos to the real Dot Hutelmyer and others who have sought justice for a broken marriage, rather than suffer in silence.",1365033600,6,541,4.42

1964786,4,B00011CYMK,"Park Overall does an excellent job as a devoted wife and mother who hasn't a clue that her husband is having an affair with his assistant.  Based on a true story,  this movie illustrates the pain causaed by infidelity, and the measures one courageous woman took to make the ""other woman"" accountable for her actions.  Inspiring and entertaining!",1362960000,3,345,4.913793103448276
1964787,5,B00011CYMK,"I'm a huge fan of most Lifetime movies, but this one is definitely one of my favorites.  Park Overall is FANTASTIC as the character Dot which really makes you root for her and sympathize with her.  It's every wive's biggest nightmare but Dot handles it in a landmark way.  After viewing this movie I am all for the ""Alienation of Affection"" law.  If you haven't seen this yet, get a copy for yourself.  Very entertaining and based on a true story!",1334534400,7,447,4.469135802469136

1964789,5,B00011CYMK,"I purchased this movie and glad I did. It was in great shape.
I learned something from it too.
My husband of 29 years had been sleeping with his female law partner from the last 12 years of our marriage. He was living two lives.
I would love to have held her accountable for her actions too. She has no moral or honor, same as my worthless husband, but she did have lots of money.  Now both of them have lots of money to spend on a ticket to hell.
It was a good purchase from Amazon, thank you.",1264982400,14,494,3.98989898989899
1964790,5,B00011CYMK,Totally excellent movie! The actors were right on and the story line can't get any better! Husband cheats on wife with low class husband stealing mistress. Wife knows it was also the mistresses fault in destroying her marrage and sets out to show the world that mistresses/homewreakers should be held accountable for their action too!!!!
