898879,4,630449436X,"From the moment the trio of young hoods in their rolled up jeans march across the screen, you know you've entered a time warp of the real and unreal past. Hollywood rarely gets contemporary social commentary right, but that only adds another cultural layer to the time and place we are witnessing. For instance, there's the ethnic tension of New York's slums, and then you hear the horn honking that obscures Lancaster's pithy remark about ""hauling ashes""-an authentically accurate sexual innuendo a bit too racy for a 1960 film. Then he uses the term ""callhouse"" which modern viewers might mistake for a phone solicitor, but it's about as dirty a word as you could get in a studio film at the time. So all of this: switchblades vs. liberal angst takes one back to a kind of a slumdwelling To Kill a Mockingbird that could only exist in early Sixties America. Burt Lancaster is great as the D.A.
If this had been made ten or so years later, it would have probably been adapted into a TV series. I waited a long time to see this picture, and it was better than I expected. If you want a look at the early Sixties in style and substance, you'll want to see this film.",1268352000,6,1165,4.474178403755869

This film is one of the stand out films of the late fifties and early sixties that dealt with social commentary of the times.  Burt Lancaster who is usually considered a very good B actor, but gives a stellar A+ performance.  It is a very well done gritty crime drama of gang violence in New York City of the time.  This film has a really good story and plot, and a good twist at the end.  It ranks right up there with films of the period such as; 12 Angry Men, Inherit the Wind and many others.

898882,4,630449436X,"I watched a lot of movies on TV when I was growing up.  Much of them were mediocre at best (I'm thinking of the Friday and Saturday night monster movies and the Saturday afternoon Roy Rogers Westerns).  Some of the movies I saw were great movies then and remain so today.  However, a few left an indelible impression on me yet seemed to disappear from public view as I grew older.  One such movie was ""The Young Savages"".  I was seared by the image of Puerto Rican gangs in New York where teenagers would kill with switchblades and beat people with log chains.  It was strange stuff for an adolescent growing up in Des Moines.  I was impressed with Burt Lancaster who was ""one of them"" but ready, as an Assistant District Attorney, to send these young murderers to the gas chamber.  I was fascinated as I watched his efforts to punish evolve into an effort to understand.  I remember wondering if other prosecutors ever handled a trial the way he did (I don't think so).  I would remember scenes from ""The Young Savages"" over the years and I was glad to finally have a chance to see it again the other night on TCM.

The second time around was as good or better because I didn't appreciate the moral story in the movie as much as I thought I had.  The same scenes of senseless violence challenged me again (although, between then and now, I had been to New York City a number of times...and survived!).  However, I had missed the tension between DA Lancaster and his proper wife who opposed capital punishment.  It was interesting to see Lancaster fight his own beliefs and put them to the test.  His efforts to get to understand the juvenile delinquents was impressive.  Each time he felt he'd had enough of their pointless violent nature, he relent and search even deeper to understand what made them click.  The further he'd push it, the harder he'd get hurt (in a variety of ways).  The trial still comes across as something out of a Broadway play rather than a district courthouse but, by that point in the movie, Lancaster had earned the right to solve things his way.  The result of the trial had touched me as a kid and seeing it again reaffirmed my first impressions.

The acting in ""The Young Savages"" was generally good to (in the case of Burt Lancaster) very good. I'll add a kudo for Telly Savalas in a supporting role.  Edward Andrews was a bit much as the ambition District Attorney who had his sights on the Governors mansion.  However, I can think of a number of current politicians who come across worse than he did.  I never really bought into Dina Merril's role (although her scene in the elevator was fairly well done).  I didn't realize that John Frankenheimer went back that far as a director but he, and the writer did very well.  I'm sorry that this movie is so seldom shown these days.  It's what we would call a ""sleeper"".  I'll watch it again the next time I can.  I just hope it isn't another 40-some years before I get the chance again.",1130889600,11,2966,4.462825278810409
898883,4,630449436X,"Burt Lancaster plays moralistic district attorney Hank Bell empowered with the prosecution of three teenagers for a cold blooded murder in acclaimed director John Frankenheimer's ""The Young Savages"".  The teens, members of a caucasian Harlem street gang The Thunderbirds knife to death a blind Puerto Rican boy in an obviously racially motivated episode.

Popular sentiment is seeking a first degree murder indictment for the accused boys.  Lancaster's boss D.A. Dan Cole played by Edward Andrews has gubernatorial aspirations.  A fast conviction would seem to cement his chances.  Unfortunately Lancaster is torn.  One of the boys happens to be the son of ex-flame Shelley Winters.  In addition, Lancaster's wife played by the attractive Dina Merrill is at odds with him over the case providing him with no solace.  Lancaster is aided in his investigation by a pre-Kojak Telly Savalas playing a similar role as the cynical Lt. Gunderson.  They are forced to hit the streets which are ruled by violent ethnic gangs to get answers.

898962,4,630449436X,"Great, topical drama which shares some DNA with Westside Story, The Blackboard Jungle and others. It is kind of the anti-Westside Story, all teen angst and no music. Burt Lancaster, of course is great. He is especially Natty sporting a pork pie hat. Telly Savalas - the late, great actor - is kind of wasted as Lancaster's co-investigator of a brutal stabbing that appears to be gang-related. One note: apparently John Frankenheimer was a total dick to Dina Merrill. I am a huge Frankeheimer fan, but now slightly less so, knowing that he, like many maie Directors over the years, intimidated a fine actress into wanting to quit acting. Shameful.

I saw this film when it was first released and I have never forgotten it. John Frankenheimer's films have that effect on you. It is a good one and I liked it then and I still like it now. It has stood the test of time. Burt Lancaster's performance is brilliant and very focused. I also like David Amram's score.

The film is a good drama that considers themes of poverty, ethnic bias, mental capacity, psychosis, morality and many other issues that make up society.

898969,4,630449436X,"For people who grew up in nice areas, small towns and quiet neighborhoods and are young this film may seem alien to them but in the grittier parts of New York back in the 50's, early 60's these were regular occurances.  The streetgangs would rumble for one reason or another with members in different clubs numbering from 4 to 1000 broken up into sets, in different districts. They usually ran along the same ethnic lines, where some other gangs were mixed, whereas today for socio/economical reasons you only have black, latin or Asian gangs left, like Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, etc.
 In this movie Burt Lancaster is a DA who in investigating a gang murder finds there are levels & complications that he did not foresee. Accompanied by a detective played by a pre Kojack Telly Savalas, they talk to suspects & witnesses in the neighborhoods where urban slum circumstances make it hard to meet people who are not jaded by things.
 Like a fore runner of todays tv show Law & Order, you see the crime, the police investigation with witnesses flashbacks of the crime & the courtroom breakdown of the crime. This movie is so spot on realistic, it's virtually a time capsule of a time when New York still had the death penalty, numerous gangs & some different police practices. And in some aspects things have not changed.  One may wonder what happened to make gang activity slow down somewhat in N.Y., only to grow in California?",1433203200,,1427,4.696

Trying to look at it away from him, I have this it is a very dated movie about Harlem in 1961. The gangs in Harlem and the social mores at the time. Even I was too young at the time so I can't say for sure but this seems exaggerated to me. The 3 stars are not so much for the story or the direction seems trite and long winded to me, the cast is superb. the grownups anyway, the ""young Savages"" are just punks and got on my nerves and that is both of the gangs involved. Burt Lancaster, Dina Merrill, Telly Savalas, Shelley Winters and Edward Andrews rise above the pace of this movie. Do I recommend it?

It is later revealed that the victim was a gang leader who played the blind man's bluff and the youngest defendant did not stab the victim, he only hit him with the blade handle.

7874154,5,630449436X,"THE YOUNG SAVAGES (1961) is a black and white movie of the ""film noir"" genre.  As such, the viewer will be treated to cinematography, where weird camera angles are used, such as the camera being near the ground and pointing upwards at a steep angle, or where the camera is elevated, and pointing down at a steep angle.

THE BEST MOVIE IN EXISTENCE.  For various reasons, I consider THE YOUNG SAVAGES to be the best movie ever made.  So many characters play a strong and convincing part.  Of course, there do exist other movies of comparable greatness, and among these are Run Silent Run Deep, Twelve Angry Men, Inherit the Wind, and Singing in the Rain.  There are many street scenes from upper Manhattan, and these are all a delight to the eye.  The street scenes are reminiscent of the street photography by Helen Levitt.

TWILIGHT ZONE.  So many of the characters have also acted in episodes of Twilight Zone.  These are the following.  TELLY SAVALAS plays a detective here, and he stars in TZ's Living Doll.  MILTON SELZER plays a psychiatrist in a prison, and he acts in TZ's Hocus-Pocus and Frisby, which stars the divine ANDY DEVINE.  LARRY GATES has a small part as a courtroom lawyer, and he stars in TZ's The Shelter, where he plays a family doctor.  EDWARD ANDREWS plays the district attorney and he is also running for public office. He stars in TZ's You Drive, and also in TZ's Third from the Sun.  Edward Andrews is known for playing characters that are obnoxious and sneaky.  He also acts in Son of Flubber.

AMBIGUITIES.  Burt Lancaster plays an assistant district attorney, and his supervisor is a character played by Edward Andrews.  Lancaster's mission throughout the movie, is to determine the degree of guilt of each of the three Italian teenagers who killed a Puerto Rican teenager.  The Italian gang is The Thunderbirds, and the Puerto Rican gang is The Horsemen.  The three Italian teenagers are admirably played by David Stewart (he plays a moron who is not capable of thinking more than one hour ahead of time), John Davis Chandler (he plays an evil killer who is the gang leader), and Stanley Kristien (he plays an aggressive thug with a soft spot, and he'd earlier rescued a young Puerto Rican boy who was about to be murdered via drowning, at the hands of John Davis Chandler).  The ambiguities faced by Burt Lancaster, all of which add drama and excitement to the plot, are as follows:

(1) Burt Lancaster had, in a much earlier time, dated the mother of one of the accused murderers (mother of Stanley Kristien's character).
(2) Burt Lancaster's character is named ""Hank Bell,"" and a complicating element in the plot, is that he'd shortened his name from the Italian ""Bellini"" to ""Bell.""
(3) The mother of the murdered Puerto Rican boy repeatedly demands of Lancaster, that he gets the three Italians executed.
(4) Edward Andrew's character, who is Lancaster's supervisor, tells Lancaster that he wants the three Italian boys to be executed.
(5) Lancaster's wife is a flaming liberal, and she is aggressive towards Lancaster, and she demands that the three Italian murderers to get a light sentence.

LUIS ARROYO.  This movie is filled with remarkable performances.  Luis Arroyo plays the teen leader of the Puerto Rican gang, The Horseman.  With great skill, he plays a charismatic teenager.  He snaps his fingers, and other people obey him, e.g., by giving him a cigarette.  Younger teenagers serve his needs, e.g., by serving as couriers and providing him with information.  Also, in an amazing tavern scene, Luis Arroyo (only a teenager) has a dialogue with Burt Lancaster (middle aged attorney), and Luis Arroyo manages to present himself to Lancaster as an equal, and to convince Lancaster of his demands.  And then, there is actress PILAR SEURAT, who plays the young sister of the murdered Puerto Rican boy.  I could devote paragraph upon paragraph to describing her amazing acting, e.g., her dignified and confident poise in the witness box during the courtroom trial, when she acknowledges that she started being a prostitute at the age 14.  Also, her anguish occurring in the moments right after her brother's murder is one of the hundreds of finely acted scenes in this movie.",1484697600,,4218,4.846368715083799

Also, her anguish occurring in the moments right after her brother's murder is one of the hundreds of finely acted scenes in this movie.",1484611200,,4214,4.832635983263598
