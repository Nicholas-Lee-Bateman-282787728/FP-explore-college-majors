7934450,4,B000059ZW7,"Thanks to Amazon.com for making this video available. COMANCHE is a solid, goodish 1950s Western, with good action, good acting, and colorful cinematography. No, it's not SHANE or THE SEARCHERS, but it is entertaining and worth an occasional viewing. You will not be disappointed.",1062720000,3,280,5.386363636363637
