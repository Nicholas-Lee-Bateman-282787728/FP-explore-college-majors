2423664,5,B000BM7YHE,"Ossie Davis was indeed a master storyteller. I saw the play on broadway with Cleavon Little in the title role and Melba Moore as Lutiebelle. I saw the play on A&E with Robert Guilluame in the title role. But, Ossie was truly Purlie in every fiber of his being. The original title of this movie was Gone Are The Days when I saw it on television many years ago. I was so taken with his performance that I taped it on a reel to reel just to hear it over and over again. Now that I have the original on dvd my children can get to see what real acting is all about. And they get to see 'The Mayor' in his prime. Yes, from the beginning Ossie knew how to 'do the right thing'!",1157673600,14,670,3.9703703703703703
2423665,5,B000BM7YHE,"I saw this on BET Movies, when they played movies you would not find anywhere else (I saw Putney Swope there as well, and this was when there was about 80 channels on cable.  Now with 300, there is still no channel like this to find).  This is a play/movie that stands the test of time, and showed Ossie's intelligence and endearance (new word) from the beginning of his theatrical career.  Showed depth in most of the characters (the Cap'n was one-dimensional.  How's that for groundbreaking), and the comedy is perfectly aimed.  Loved this movie from the first time I saw it, and like stated before, a movie I'll be proud to provide to my kids for their enjoyment.  Recommended to all!",1155254400,3,687,4.590163934426229
2423666,4,B000BM7YHE,"With the recent passing of Ossie Davis, I wanted to see some of his earlier works. As I expected his play, turned into film, was outstanding. He and Ruby Dee were always captivating and it's good to know that their chemistry was there from the start.

Supporting characters, such as Alan Alda, were essential to this story line. Though, nowadays, I'd consider Mr. Cambridge's performance a bit bafoonish ... it  flowed with the times and tone of the story.  His part made for a better ""read"" than to actually ""see"" him play the part.

Overrall, I'm glad I have it for my collection of black films to pass on to my two sons.",1141948800,8,623,4.486725663716814
2423667,5,B000BM7YHE,"Purlie Victorious stars screenplay author Ossie Davis as a preacher who comes back home to scheme five hundred dollars away from ol' Massa Cotchipee (Sorrell Booke of Dukes Of Hazard) so he can start his own church. He gets an assist from Cotchipee's liberal son, Alan Alda in his plan to free his people through the word of the Lord.  It may not sound funny but this is a great comedy.

The DVD is crisp and almost perfectly dustless.",1140739200,4,435,4.493670886075949

2423680,5,B000BM7YHE,"With many of its original cast members, this
film version of Ossie Davis' 1961 Broadway
comedy is a fascinating remnant of a lost
Broadway age, with entertaining portrayals
by Davis, Ruby Dee, Alan Alda and Godrey

2423681,5,B000BM7YHE,"This is a brilliant comedy that features some of the best that the entertainment world ever had to offer. It includes Ozzie Davis, Alan Alda and Godfrey Cambrige. It actually starts out with a music procession and was probably part of the inspiration for the musical. The cast is great and there are many wonderful and funny moments., It's in black and white but is a colorful piece. Get this copy today.",1392336000,,404,4.625
2423682,5,B000BM7YHE,"My Mother and I enjoy old black and white movies featuring African-Americans.  This movie is one of the classics!!  For the era, the actors are rich with dialogue and eager to please their audience.  A very young Ossie Davis gives a stellar performance is this simple, but delightful story",1390867200,,289,4.857142857142857

2423684,5,B000BM7YHE,"This in itself is a time capsule from the civil rights movement years.  The performances are incomparable.  Every American high school student should be required to view and discuss the significance of this movie, along with ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""A Family Thing,"" with regard to the history of race relations in these United States.  ""Purlie Victorious"" stands as, among other things an extraordinary tribute not only to Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, but to all the cast members, living and dead.",1370649600,5,499,4.9879518072289155
2423685,5,B000BM7YHE,I can still remember snatches of dialogue from 40 years ago. I didn't know if seeing the DVD so many years later would hold up. It does! Ossie Davis is delightful as the sincere but bombastic Purlie! But Ruby Dee as Lutiebelle Gussiemay Jenkins is absolutely fabulous! I still love Purlie Victorious.,1363046400,,300,4.788461538461538

2423689,5,B000BM7YHE,"In this exuberant film Ossie Davis really shines. Godfrey Cambridge is superb as ""Gitlow""
(if only his singing was as great as his acting). Self ordained Rev. Purlie preaches a
message of ""Freedom""! It strikes me a freedom of a dubious sort kind of like
""Change"" does today. The flow of the rhetoric throughout this film is a linguistic
marvel. Alan Alda has the only purely virtuous role in this film. This purity was
threatened with his ""Hind legs line"" but then he had to communicate with his
Confederate flag displaying Pa somehow. This movie is well worth watching!",1264032000,,570,4.767676767676767

2423692,4,B000BM7YHE,"Rebben Purlie (Ossie Davis) concocts a plan to get a $500 inheritance from Captain Stonewall Jackson Cotchipee, so the good rebben can buy the Bethel Church.  The cast includes naive country belle Lutiebelle GussieMae Jenkins - expertly played by Ruby Dee, stodgy Captain Cotchipee - fabulously portrayed by Sorrell Booke (of Dukes of Hazzard fame) and passive peacemaker Charlie Cotchipee - brought to life by a young Alan Alda, whose country accent kept me in stitches.

The cast is rounded out with Godfrey Cambridge and Hilda Haynes, who play Gitlow and Missy Judson, relatives of Rebben Purlie and the always superb Beah Richards as Idella, the Captain's cook.  Even with this great cast, this is really Davis' film and he carries it with a charm and style that is second to none.

This film is highly entertaining!  It is about the old south, so if you're offended by stereotypical characters and language, then this may not be for you.  I'm glad I have it in my collection.",1229472000,,980,4.838323353293413
2423693,5,B000BM7YHE,"I first came across this film version of ""Pulie Victorious"" back in 1998 when I was cast in a local production of the play (I played Charlie Cotchipee, the role played by Alan Alda in this film.) The wonderful thing about this picture, is that it stays true to it's stage roots. After the opening scene, a rousing sermon, the walls of the church open up to reveal a road, on which Lutiebelle and Purlie begin their journey. This is very like how such a transition would be handled on stage! One can really imagine people standing up in their seats and cheering this film in the theatre! Our director, the late Bob Ingram, was a gem to introduce us to the film, and I hope you will take this rare chance, this isn't a movie you see on the shelf at Blockbuster! Funny, heartwarming and puts a fire in your belly to want to change the world!",1221436800,,838,4.310126582278481
2423694,5,B000BM7YHE,Very good movie of Purlie Victorious. I am looking forward to having the 1981 musical version of Purlie on DVD when it comes out.,1207612800,,129,4.416666666666667
2423695,5,B000BM7YHE,"Actually, I have yet to see a live version with Ossie & Ruby but read the play years ago.  I can't wait to see it realized especially with the original author, Ossie Davis, playing Purlie.  I did see a version with Melba Moore playing Lutiebelle which was quite good - but Ossie Davis & Ruby Dee are, in my humble opinion, the quintessential First Couple in African-American theatre - any chance to see them perform together is always a treat.  Even as a read, the play is quite hilarious and it works all the more imagining such talent as Ossie & Ruby realizing the roles.  As a matter of fact, I read ""Purlie Victorious"" and 'Day of Absence"" by Douglas Turner Ward, another excellent example of black theatre, together - they complement each other quite well as shining examples of black comedy satirizing existing racial attitudes then (hmmmm..and now..)  The play is timeless, is not at ALL archaic by todays standards as many of the same issues tackled in Purlie as well as Day of Absence still exist, alas, in 2007.

But on a lighter note, owning a copy of ""Purlie Victorious"" performed by its auspicious author, the incomparable Ossie Davis, is simply a must for your collection.",1197504000,,1186,4.677884615384615
2423696,4,B000BM7YHE,This movie reminds me how much I love Ruby Dee and Ozzie Davis. They really do compliment each other with their acting as well as their relationship. She was the Ying to his Yang.,1174867200,4,179,4.294117647058823
