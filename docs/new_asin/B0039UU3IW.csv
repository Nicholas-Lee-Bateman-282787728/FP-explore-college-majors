A nice movie that brings back the feeling of sitting at home when there were

4098083,5,B0039UU3IW,"From the first time I saw it on TV in the late 70's , I really enjoyed it mostly due to the boeing 727 being my favorite airliner of all time. It was a very well-made airliner film.",1360972800,3,181,3.789473684210526

8392357,5,B0039UU3IW,"Only in the bizarre universe of 70's network TV could we find the trio of David Janssen (MOON OF THE WOLF, FER-DE-LANCE), Christopher George (GRIZZLY, DAY OF THE ANIMALS, GRADUATION DAY, PIECES), and ""Dandy"" Don Meredeth (TERROR ON THE 40TH FLOOR, TV's MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL) sharing the cockpit of a commercial airline. In MAYDAY AT 40,000 FEET, we witness just such a scenario. Indeed, These three play Captain Pete Douglass, co-pilot Stan Burkhart, and co-co-pilot Mike Fuller, respectively. Once we get past their soap-opera-ish personal / love lives, the reason for the title finally comes into play. It seems that a hard-boiled cop w/ a heart condition (Broderick Crawford!) is supposed to be transporting an extremely dangerous, bug-eyed, homicidal maniac named Greco (played by my personal lord and savior, Marjoe Gortner- EARTHQUAKE, THE FOOD OF THE GODS, STARCRASH) aboard their plane. Not surprisingly, Greco has other plans. How could a man w/ a bum ticker, escorting a crazy killer possibly be a problem? Madness ensues. Oh no! The aircraft itself undergoes mechanical failure after Greco shoots a bullet through the plane's hydraulic system! All this, while Pete's wife undergoes life-saving surgery! And, there's a baby on board! While this movie has more cheeeze than a thousand pizzerias, it's also quite entertaining, especially whenever Greco gets going! He's totally bananas don't ya know?! Co-stars the magnificent Ray Milland (X: THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES, THE THING WITH TWO HEADS, FROGS, THE UNCANNY, THE ATTIC) as the crankiest passenger in the galaxy, and Lynda Day George (DAY OF THE ANIMALS, BEYOND EVIL, PIECES) as the world's most impossibly upbeat stewardess! Highly recommended for lovers of 70's made-for-TV extravaganzas...",1449964800,,1759,5.353790613718411
8392358,4,B0039UU3IW,"Mayday at 40,000 Feet is a regulation crisis-in-the-air TV movie distinguished by the accomplished direction of Robert Butler that features David Janssen,Don Meredith,Christopher George,Ray Milland,Lynda Day George,Margaret Blye,Marjoe Gortner and Broderick Crawford.

Blinding snow threatens to send a jetliner hurtling toward doom. But Captain Pete Douglass has more than a snowstorm to battle when an armed madman turns the fuselage into a shooting gallery and his fellow passengers into clay pigeons. Adding to Janssen's growing list of problems is a maniac who goes on a shooting rampage in the first-class section.

This TV movie was made in the tradition of Airport, The Towering Inferno and more epics of disaster that were commonly made during the 1970's. While the screenplay has used recycled plot lines and element from other disaster movies and it lacks the tension and suspense required to do films of such genres,it still will manage to entertain the viewers who does not mind the year it was made.",1440460800,,1013,5.325

8392361,5,B0039UU3IW,"I have all the 70 airport pictures. Some are better than others of course. In  all these movies you have to set through all the problems going on in the lives of the main actors. That can get very dull and even old if there is to much of it. Of course it is necessary to a point, but some of these  points can drag on to long in many of these movies, but not in this one. This movie is the best of them all. Just the right time put in on all the parts that make the movie great and a great deal more action which after all is what you are looking for. This is one of those movies you will want to watch more than once. The star David Janssen does a good job but, be ready for a surprise it is Don Meredith who turns out to be the true star of the movie. This is a great movie that you will want in your collection. Just the right mixture of all the parts. No time is wasted, you will find yourself hanging onto every moment.",1434931200,7,924,3.832460732984293
