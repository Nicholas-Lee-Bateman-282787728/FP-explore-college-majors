Just driving the coastal road is fantastic, with many scenic spots (all beaches in Oahu are open to the public), but I don't recall it being mentioned on the dvd.  Oahu is much better than its stores and clubs!!! And true Hawaiian music is lovely... there wasn't much of it on the dvd.",1210118400,,446,4.5625
8367582,4,B0009Y2M6C,This DVD is well worth the money.  It gives a lot of information for the first time visitor and reminds more seasoned visitors of some of the great places to visit in Oahu.  I will probably purchase some of the others.,1209340800,3,218,4.2926829268292686
8367583,3,B0009Y2M6C,"There are some great things in this dvd, but it is more geared toward a history lesson.  I bought this trying to find out about all the things to do on the island so I can plan my trip and was disappointed.  There are some short clips of the beaches and then a lot of attention is given to night clubs which I have no interest in.  There's also some time dedicated to surfing the North Shore.",1208908800,,392,4.064935064935065
