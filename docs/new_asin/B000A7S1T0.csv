8076055,5,B000A7S1T0,"I first checked this DVD out from the library and was skeptical because I'd only heard about Baby Einstein, and how their products are the best.  While we do love Baby Einstein, I was so surprised at how much our baby loves THIS video!  When she's fussy or tired, or just wants some entertainment, this video is a can't miss!  Baby Einstein doesn't always captivate her enough to keep her entertained for the entire video.  Not so with Fun Baby!  It works every time!  I'm going to buy the other video next.",1199664000,,507,4.456521739130435
8076056,5,B000A7S1T0,"You can't go wrong with FUN BABY.  I highly recommend this for any baby...make this the first DVD you purchase for your baby!  This was my nephews favorite DVD for over 9 months.  My nephew gave this DVD his full attention at 3.5mons. of age when nothing else would pacify him in the car.  This continued to be his favorite far and above any of the Baby Einstein series DVD's.  We tried others, but we always came back to FUN BABY.  This was a true life saver.  He is 20mons. now, and he still chooses this DVD quite frequently.  He is now having conversations with the characters on screen.  The content is very stimulating for babies at all stages.  My sister still raves about the peace it has provided while riding in the car.  Fun Baby entertained when he was awake and when he was tired it put him to sleep.
I purchased Calm Baby in combo with Fun Baby.  Calm Baby did not go over as big with my nephew.  He was a serious sleep fighter, and he knew this was making him tired.  Thus, he was never happy with Calm Baby and when the DVD was played he became a fussy baby.  I thought the DVD had great music and the perfect animation to put babies to sleep, but it did not work for my nephew.  I am sure CALM BABY works wonders for the majority, but I know FUN BABY will be a huge hit with your child.
Don't let the low number of reviews make you shy away.  FUN BABY will be worth the $$ time and again.",1193356800,,1405,4.106617647058823
8076057,3,B000A7S1T0,"This is a good DVD but ""Calm Baby"" is way better. It does not capture my daughter's attention like Calm Baby does...she is bored after 15 minutes.",1160092800,,146,4.444444444444445
8076058,5,B000A7S1T0,"my 6 month old son loves this movie, most movies he can not sit all the way throu but his one he watches over and over. The CD that comes with it is really great to. He really enjoys the music and loves to see all the colors and animals.",1144627200,,237,3.76
8076059,5,B000A7S1T0,This DVD is awesome :)  Both my 3 year old and 9 month old like the music and the images.  The music is fun and the puppets are cute.  Great purchase :),1142208000,,152,3.6875
8076060,5,B000A7S1T0,"A friend first recommended the Calm Baby video when my son was 5 months old.  I was a little skeptical because I thought he was a little too young for videos.  We have several of the Baby Einstein videos, and they are all nice but none have ever really held his attention for very long.  But, for some reason, my son really loved Calm Baby.  The combination of puppets, nature scenes, and toys set to soothing music really calmed him down during his pre-bedtime fussy period.  Calm Baby was a God-Send and I have since given copies to several other new moms I know.

Then, for my son's first birthday, my friend again came to the rescue and bought us the Fun Baby video.  This time I was expecting great things, and I was not disappointed.

If you are familiar with the Calm Baby video, Fun Baby has the same premise - uses a water theme, puppets, animals, and nature scenes set to a combination of classical music and nursery rhymes.  The music in this video though is more upbeat and the puppets and toys are all active, busy and happy.  The same duck that we loved from Calm Baby is here too.  This time he goes about his routine of setting up for a relaxing day at the beach (sets down his blanket, ball, umbrella, etc).  My son especially loves the Duck and makes quacking sounds each time he sees it.  He loves to dance to the music.  I enjoy the music myself and enjoyed some of the not-so-standard nursery rhymes that I'd forgotten about from my childhood.

Fun Baby kept my son's attention for the entire video (around 30 min), which is a pretty hard thing to do.

Fun Baby also comes with an audio CD which is a nice feature.",1128988800,11,1635,4.346534653465347
