8259167,5,B0015MO3QE,"If you teach American History in high school (or college), this is a fantastic series of videos that take the viewer from 1492-2000 (if you buy both sets). You can also buy the book that correlates with the DVDS. I have used this series for years and originally purchased them for about $40-50 each. Now they want $800! I am going to assume that this is because they are out of print and thus the price has become exorbitant. I would encourage teachers to clamor for a reprint so that this highly valuable resource can be made affordable and therefore much more accessible. Easily the best video resource for American History out there.",1306886400,2,636,4.6371681415929205
