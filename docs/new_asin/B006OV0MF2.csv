I normally don't bother giving reviews, but I wanted to say that since I have a fair memory at best this program helped me in school and at work.  Professor Scott Straub does a great job showing how to use his memory technique for remembering large amounts of information.  I will say that you have to put in a little time and energy, but it's worth it.  The only suggestion I have is for Professor Straub to have physical book as I think this would help compliment his program.",1355097600,,603,4.405405405405405

Not only does it help you memorize more information in less time, there are dynamite study tips included will definitely help your grades.  If you don't want to put in any effort, then this program (or any other program for that matter) won't help you, but Professor Straub's DVD gets right to the point which makes it easy to follow and learn from.",1325980800,,439,4.475
