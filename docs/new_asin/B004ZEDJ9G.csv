4507783,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"I hope that once and for all, the myth that Heifetz played without emotion will be erased. Although I'm not a great fan of his Bach, I found the excerpts from the chaconne absolutely riveting. My minor complaint was that it didn't discuss the instruments he played. As for his being ""isolated"" or ""lonely"", the many scenes of his social life should dispel that idea. If he was lonely in his old age, it was because his closest friends had died. If you haven't been old, you may not understand that.",1312156800,45,498,4.483516483516484

4507785,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"I had the opportunity to see this beautiful documentary film about Mr. Heifetz. Throughout the film, there are many chances to hear his great violin artistry. Great clips from his own home movies with family and friends are shown for the first time. This film will provide a great introduction to a generation that only knows his name and a first time look into his private world for many of those who have heard him play in person. Ayke Agus contributes heartfelt opinions and insight into the man that she worked with for his last 15 years.(Look for her marvelous book ""Heifetz as I knew him"".) My favorite part of the film was when he received his first ""bad"" review as a young celebrated performer and how it affected him. He reacted and recaptured his devotion to his artistry because he listened to the writer. Dr. Dario Sarlo contributed a great deal of research to the film and participated in the lively panel discussion at the premiere in Los Angeles.(He is working on a translation of a biography of the young years in Russian before Hr. Heifetz came to the USA in 1917. I am looking forward to this book which I believe he mentioned is to be published shortly by Indiana University Press.) Also present on the panel in addition to Dr. Sarlo and Ayke Agus was Arthur Vered (His book ""Jascha Heifetz"" was published in 1986). Mr. Vered is also interviewed in the film. Interesting views of Itzhak Perlman and Ivry Gitlis and other performers round out some of the personalities talking about Mr. Heifetz. Peter Rosen went to Russia and Lithuania as well as the Lloyd Wright Studio that was formally at Mr. Heifetz's Beverly Hills home and is now at the Colburn School of Music in Los Angeles. I only saw the film once and look forward to getting my DVD copy.",1306800000,63,1767,4.594936708860759

4507789,1,B004ZEDJ9G,"Comments re. to DVD ""Jascha Heifetz: God's Fiddler
The DVD I purchased on July 9, 2015 is impossible to watch [synchronization between the image and the sound is 2 seconds off throughout the entire film!]. Although the visual images are fine, the accompanying sound track was transferred with an almost 2 second delay, making the artist's violin playing, interviewee's comments, excerpts of orchestras, conductors, even ocean surf, etc. all being completely out-of-sync.  Anyone hoping to see excerpts of Heifetz's impeccable finger technique will be sorely disappointed as the notes will not be in sync with the fingering.

I bought this DVD on July 9th, 2015 and had trusted the company to provide me with a transfer comparable to the recently aired documentary shown on PBS.  Just now viewed it (Sept. 1) and have found that it is defective.  Amazon notes that the deadline for having initiated a return passed on August 14th so I am stuck with this defective dvd.

4507792,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"I found this documentary on Jascha Heifietz to be very interesting.  You get a picture of one of the greatest violinists of all time as a man as well as the master of the violin.  Based on this biography it seems Heifetz was a rather difficult person and his reputation as cold and that he showed no emotions as he played are understandable; but as he said, he showed his emotions and feelings through his music, what else did people want from him?  Music was his life; without music what would his life have been like?  The first critical review of his performance while still in his teens changed his music and his life---he had never received a negative review of his music before this and it threw him into a deep depression.  It also changed his commitment to his music and he worked on making sure each note, each piece, were perfect and this continued through the rest of his life.  He had one enduring friendship with a fellow musician, a cellist, who enjoyed playing music with him and he was crushed when this friend died.  Marriages didn't last; he didn't maintain relationships with his children; his students feared him and addressed him formally.  Maybe the curse of genius and total commitment to one thing is that this commitment doesn't leave time for the development of other interests or aspects of personality. Heifetz was a child prodigy who achieved fame and fortune during his life through his virtuosity on the violin.  Better to have someone like Jascha Heifetz appreciated solely for his special gifts rather than expecting him to be like other people or wanting something from him he doesn't possess or is not capable of giving.",1433030400,,1655,4.71875

Heifetz...great violinist. Peculiar human being with few social skills...he could have been in IT. I would have felt sorry for the guy but on the DVD he invokes so little empathy.

How is it then possible that this man seems to, for the most part, been relegated to the dust bin of our musical and cultural history?

Not everything is spelled out in terms of details of Heifetz's adult family/personal life (I have read a few negative comments in regards to this), but one can read pretty easily between the lines to get a good idea, I think.  Perhaps (likely), family members were asked to contribute but declined.  Anyway, if you are a Heifetz fan, I highly recommend it.",1396915200,,385,4.7164179104477615
4507806,4,B004ZEDJ9G,"To those of us dazzled by his playing, the closed-off mystery of Heifetz the person has always been a puzzle. This brings some light to that, and also some appreciation of how he developed his unique gifts. Well worthwhile.",1390348800,,223,4.743589743589744

4507809,4,B004ZEDJ9G,"Overall this was a very good documentary, and the fact that they finally made one about Heifetz is enough to satisfy me.
My only complaint is that I think there could/should have been more footage of him actually playing. I don't believe you hear or see him play an entire piece or even one complete movement in the entire film.
I understand this is a documentary, but when you make a documentary about one of the greatest violinists of all time, the least you could do is give us an additional video of him playing the Mendelssohn or some Saint Saens, or SOMETHING. You get a few good clips of him playing Saint Saens (Intro & Rondo Capriccioso), Bach (D Minor Chaconne), and Bruch (Scottish Fantasy), and a few others. But they're all cut up, just clips here and there. Honestly, I'm pretty sure that all the performance footage in this documentary can be found on YouTube (in its entirety).

Where this documentary really shines is his personal life and home movies. You do see a good deal of young Heifetz behind the scenes, and there's plenty of great information and stories and everything else.

Like I said it's a great documentary overall, but don't buy it if you're just looking to watch Heifetz play. You can do better on YouTube.",1370908800,9,1241,4.610859728506787

4507813,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"Heifetz was the greatest violinist of the twentieth century; this is almost indisputable. No reason to doubt that the documentary may be  extremely interesting. To call Heifetz a ""fiddler"", is derogatory (and I would say stupid, because demeaning him was the least of the producers' intentions).

4507817,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"Everybody...some time in their lives...has heard Jascha Heifetz.  But do we really understand the man?  There are so many insights - not only about him - but about life in general that make this film a must-see.

I learned, for example, the value of a truthful critic.  Always being praised as ""the best"", Mr. Heifetz took his talent for granted and eventually was giving performances without practicing.  One critic noticed it, and wrote a scathing review.  The violinist was devastated but was changed nearly overnight.  Gone was his carefree nature...and he became an absolute perfectionist. Even his hair style and posture changed. No question - there is an emotional difference between the younger and the older Heifetz.  In the documentary, Itzhak Perlman talks a considerable deal...and while he radiates warmth the same cannot be said about Jascha Heifetz as an individual.  Of course, in performances, that is altogether something different.  The movie offers many splendid examples of Heifetz's virtuosity.  Those interested in this film should also check out the film - The Art of Violin - which includes performances by other ""greats"" such as Nathan Milstein and Ginette Neveu.

There were other moments in the film that touched me very deeply.  One was the fact he liked to raise the flag of the United States in the morning at his mansion in Malibu...he was so proud to be an American.  Another was the effort he made to perform for the U.S. troops during World War II.  There is a scene where it was pouring down rain, and only one, just one soldier came to the concert.  Jascha Heifetz played the violin during the rain for that one man...He was engaged to do a concert and that was what he was going to do.  He remarked that it was one of his finest performances.  What a man!

But there are dark sides also.  This perfectionist could not bother with his children, who were probably normal kids, and let them down terribly...going so far as to write them out of his handwritten will.  He died alone. Consider the contrast with a musician such as Leonard Bernstein. When Bernstein died, huge gatherings of people of New York City lined up the sidewalks...and mourned.

The bottom line is that Jascha Heifetz was a man larger than life, perhaps even too large for himself.",1343692800,13,2287,4.825192802056555
4507818,5,B004ZEDJ9G,It was a great pleasure to watch this DVD. No one has ever played violin better than Jascha Heifetz. He was born with his violin.,1339459200,2,129,4.2
4507819,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"Peter Rosen has done it yet again !!!
In the realm of classical music documentaries, "" God's fiddler"" is second only to ""Aram Katchaturian"" but just as valuable to have in one's collection.

4507820,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"I'm not a musician, I don't know the musical notes, but I'm fascinated by the sound of the violin of Jascha Heifetz. Three years ago, after having seen the movie ""The Concert"" I became a maniac of classical music. I read any musical forum on internet and, because his unique virtuosisms,  Jascha Heifetz is my preferred violinist. I also love Nathan Milstein, David Oystrakh, and Gidon Kremer. I own the complete edition of Heifetz' recordings, and this DVD was an interesting way to know also the life of this great violinist. Thank you, God's Fiddler!",1333497600,3,553,4.821052631578947
4507821,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"""God's Fiddler"" sounds like a film about a hillbilly evangelist. I wondered, at first, the reason for such a tacky title. Around the middle of the video I learned the reason. When the great Hungarian violin teacher, Leopold Auer, was asked to name his best pupils, he left Heifetz off the list. Why? ""Heifetz is not my student. He is God's student,"" answered Auer.

There has never been a violinist who equaled Jascha Heifetz's playing; not even Paganini. There is something truly unique about Heifetz's playing that's hard to explain. Even when playing an open ""G"", as in the beginning of the 2nd Bruch concerto, we know in an instant that it's Heifetz who's playing it.

What Heifetz was able to achieve with the violin was more than remarkable. It was uncanny. Having seen all of the previous Heifetz videos, I wasn't expecting anything new from this one. ""God's Fiddler"" contains a lot of previously viewed material, but it also has video clips from the Heifetz archives I've never seen before. That's worth the price of the video by itself. It also has wonderful commentaries from such noted individuals as Ivry Gitlis, Itzhak Perlman, Sherry Kloss, and Ayke Agus. In the case of the last, Ayke Agus probably knew Heifetz best, as she was with him from the time she began studying with him until his death.

This video is one that I shall never sell and I made a copy of it so I won't wear out the original. It really is THAT good. High quality video & audio & never boring-- not even for a second. My only complaint is that I wish it could have been longer. So, my recommendations to you is...

Don't just sit there, BUY IT NOW! What are you waiting for?",1324425600,27,1660,4.560402684563758
4507822,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"A wonderful documentary, with great effort in the soundtrack quality and a lot of previously unseen material. Every violinist should see this film and reflect on it. Heifetz wasn't just ""God's Fiddler"", he also was (and is) the ""Fiddlers' God"", and what he gave the world and contributed to the art of violin playing has not been duplicated, or even approximated, yet. The film evokes reflections on aspects of the human nature of this legendary performer and his relationships with family, friends, colleagues and students. A must - highly recommended!",1323561600,16,553,5.155555555555556
4507823,5,B004ZEDJ9G,"Heifetz was the most important violinist in XX Century and there was great violinists like Menuhin, Francescatti, Milstein, etc. But the name God's Fiddler can give us an idea of over estimation and it's not true for Heifetz. He has a performance very special in this recorded notes. We can say: God is very well with Heifetz.",1322179200,7,326,4.7368421052631575
4507824,4,B004ZEDJ9G,"I believe this is the first substantial documentary on Heifetz's life and career - at least that has been commercially available on video.  Prior to this, we pretty much had legend - which consisted largely of word-of-mouth stories, as well as a few very poorly done biographies of Heifetz's life to rely on, plus the short films by Rudy Polk and Bernard Luber (later retitled ""Heifetz and Piatigorsky"").  The books ""Heifetz Through My Eyes"" by Ayke Agus and ""Heifetz as I Knew Him"" by Sherry Kloss provided a good deal of information about his later life, but his early years was unknown. Masterfully produced by Peter Rosen, it contains a lot of fascinating material.  For those of us who really know what Jascha Heifetz achieved in his performing career and just how 'sui generis' he was in this World, this film is really a treasure trove.  But it was done in such a way that is accessible to nearly everyone.  Rosen begins the film in Russia, and captured some wonderful photography of present-day Vilna, Lithuania, where Heifetz was born.  The inclusion of Heifetz's home movies is, I think, one of the best aspects of the film.  There is even footage of him with Prof. Leopold Auer, legendary pedagogue and teacher.  I was amazed when I saw those mere 15 seconds of the two of them together talking and joking - Heifetz with his fiddle and Auer holding the score.  Apparently, Auer never claimed that Heifetz was his pupil - that he was a student of God...God's fiddler.
Rosen got a number of good interviewers for the film, including Ida Haendel, Ivry Gitlis, cellist Nathaniel Rosen, Itzhak Perlman, Seymour Lipkin, and several of his former students, including Agus and Kloss.  Agus, who still lives in the Los Angeles area, was the most important individual in Heifetz's life in his later years, and she provides significant insight about him and added a lot to the film.  She sacrificed a lot of her life for him.  By then, he was no longer concertizing and most of what few friends and colleagues from the early years, including Gregor Piatigorsky, had died, and his students and his class at USC were what he really lived for.  Not much is included in the film about his family - family was always difficult for him and he had almost no relationship with any of them.  Agus provides a bit of insight as to why.  If there is anything to criticize, I guess it would be some quite awkward voiceovers that appear throughout the film, of various Heifetz quotations.  We don't hear anything from one Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod, Heifetz's principal biographer, whom Heifetz unsuccessfully sued before they became very good friends (Axelrod fled from the US in 2004 after serving a jail sentence for tax evasion.)  Quite a bit of footage of previously-released Heifetz material are integrated very well, including the 1953 Polk/Luber films, the 1970 French TV special with the Bruch Scottish Fantasy and Bach Chaconne (and recital numbers with Brooks Smith at the piano), and the 1962 Master Class series produced by Nathan Kroll.  And thankfully, Heifetz's studio is still intact and being well preserved by the Colburn School (Mrs. Colburn is listed as a producer in the credits.)  Peter Rosen has indeed achieved a lot with this film.",1319241600,27,3239,4.8140794223826715
