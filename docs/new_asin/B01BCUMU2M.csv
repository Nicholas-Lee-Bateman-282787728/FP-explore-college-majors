7626611,1,B01BCUMU2M,"Holy moly.  This coming of age story was unwatchable.

We longed for rotten fruit and vegetables to throw at the screen as the credits rolled.

I hope the cast did thus work pro-bono.

Anyway.  4 thumbs down.  Horrible.",1462060800,2,219,4.631578947368421
7626612,5,B01BCUMU2M,"One of my favorite films of the year.  So down to earth, and something we can all relate to.  More films should be made like this; eloquent yet subtle, and to the point without being on the nose.  It's clearly made straight from the heart.  The actors all give amazing performances.
Matthew McDuffie has become one of my favorite directors.  And a very well produced film.
Watch this movie.",1461715200,3,390,4.594202898550725
7626613,5,B01BCUMU2M,"Sure, Burning Bodhi will easily be compared to earlier films like ""The Big Chill,"" but there is an interesting depth of several performances which I was not expecting and which makes this film especially satisfying. Academy-Award nominee Virginia Madsen gives a passionate performance as the mother who wants her son back in her life, after not being the parent she would have wished for him. I would have liked to seen more screen time for her in this film, but the performances from the rest of the cast makes us realize that there is a LOT going on in everyone's lives.

I would recommend ""Burning Bodhi"" for 18 and over. I enjoyed it immensely the first time and when I get my DVD copy, I will be gladly be watching it again!",1461456000,5,729,4.5227272727272725

8749839,3,B01BCUMU2M,I was curious to see this since it had Kaley Cuoco of Big Bang. It was an okay movie but a little slow at times. Better off to rent than to buy if you are curious.,1491264000,,163,3.5555555555555554

8749841,3,B01BCUMU2M,Interesting movie if you like movies filled with neurotic directionless characters with no clue about how to deal with life let alone death after being out of high school for several years. Unfortunately far to many people are just like the characters in this movie so it is a fairly accurate depiction of the generation it is trying to portray.,1482796800,,345,4.766666666666667

8749843,5,B01BCUMU2M,"Although this is meant for a younger generation I found it to be well acted and a real reminder of my own personal similar experiences. I've been really impressed with Landon Liboiron lately, he's a fantastic young actor.",1466467200,,221,4.842105263157895
