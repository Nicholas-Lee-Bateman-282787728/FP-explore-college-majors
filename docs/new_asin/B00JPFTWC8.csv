This is extremely powerful stuff. At first what terrifies is the opacity of the motives of the two anti-heroes, who are traveling around in their car, filming what they describe as a documentary about the cause of people's actions, a documentary in which they kill people. Then it becomes apparent that they are getting back at the ones who let them down...a botched up childcare system that took them out of a good foster home and placed them back in the home where they had suffered abuse...and were bound to suffer it again, even more terrible than before.
Definitely watch this one if you like revenge movies!!!",1412553600,,630,4.7889908256880735

6382759,4,B00JPFTWC8,"The description of this film was a little misleading; I was fearing a nihilistic journal of two serial killers recording their random thrill-killings in gruesome fashion, but there is more to the film than that.  It has a real psychological subtext that helps explain the characters motivations.  My only real problem with the film is the use of the ""found footage/character-recorded footage"" approach, which I generally find very annoying as the sloppiness (shaky, hand-held cameras, etc.) of the film making distracts from the plot. Infliction would have worked better as just a straight, dramatic film.",1407283200,,605,5.3578947368421055

6382762,4,B00JPFTWC8,"This is one of the better comedic productions of 2014!!!! This is one of them films to cuddle up with your special one, and enjoy laughing so hard the room will stink with both of you involuntarily farting from not being able to hold it in from the hard laughter!!!!",1405987200,,266,4.34
6382763,4,B00JPFTWC8,"My 3s are usually begrudging- not 'its okay' in the positive sense, but 'its ok...', meaning meh. Few films get that from me, as I tend not to be neutral about most things. First, I wasn't clear with the synopsis description about the 2 brothers who film a homicidal rampage. I didn't realize the 2 brothers WERE the homicidal rampage. Rampage is not the best word, as its really not a wide scale killing spree but they do more than just capture it on video. The production values were adequate and nothing distracted or interrupted the film experience. What I really liked about it was the chemistry between the brothers. I really felt them and they came off believable to me. I liked the gradual unfolding of the reason for their actions. I liked it not being thrown up at the very beginning but gradually revealed what the targets did. Its a revenge crusade. It made it far more interesting and also kept the dialogue from being total crap. Like I said before, the frontal assault is contained and so there's not a huge body count or anything like that. The kills are appropriately mean at times. That's a good thing. I felt a little bit ambivalent when the sister entered the picture. She did not fit that well, which actually doesn't hinder the plot, given the relationship between her and her brothers. But she felt a bit 'much', perhaps overacted or just not harmonious enough with the other 2. I don't want to say more to avoid spoilers. However, a lot of action transpired after her arrival in the film, so it was only minimally distracting until it wasn't at all. I was entertained and I've seen many lo budget/indie type flicks, and even bigger budget ones recently, that did not hit the sweet spot, so good job for that. I did not watch it during prime time hours, and I think that was a good choice on my part.",1405900800,3,1823,4.5105740181268885
6382764,3,B00JPFTWC8,"Can't begin to go into (or need too) the detail of the other fine reviews as I am not a film critic.  I find it a fine example of the Dramality/YouTube life we live in, as well as a prime depiction that not all monster come from the paranormal.  There are plenty scarier creatures hiding in plain sight.  Also a fine Indy/guerrilla effort #IMHO & sure too and should become a cult classic",1405123200,2,388,4.287671232876712

8652772,5,B00JPFTWC8,I am really impressed with Jack Thomas Smith (the man who created this) and the way he brought his vision to life! Theres no shaky cam..Infliction is very scary because it deals with real horror...the kind that scars people and makes them behave violently in turn. I highly recommended this movie to anyone!!,1517616000,,308,4.830188679245283
8652773,1,B00JPFTWC8,"I'm glad I only rented this movie and didn't buy it. Now I love found footage films and I have seen a lot of them. This was one of the worst I have seen, bad acting and just bad overall.

I thought the plot description was interesting but I can see it was good only in thought and not in actually making the movie. I would not recommend this movie at all.",1456963200,,355,3.9305555555555554

8652775,5,B00JPFTWC8,"After watching, I decided to read other reviews before writing mine. I'm going against the grain of some, but I think this film played out exactly as it was intended. These types of films are intended to look unscripted, so the actors played their roles well. I appreciate how it takes pretty much the whole film for the complete story to completely unfold. It held my attention from beginning to end. If there were going to be a ""Best Actor"" award for this one, I'd say the father won it hands down. He was impeccable in his role. One thing I will agree with other reviews is that the ""argument"" scenes would have been a little more dramatic if the brothers weren't pointing the cameras at each other. Despite that, I'd say it's a great film and I'm glad I purchased instead of rented so I can watch again with friends.",1425168000,,820,4.437086092715232

8652778,5,B00JPFTWC8,"The most original ""found footage"" film in years. It has character. It has depth. What a pleasant, chilling surprise. A psychotic spree worth investigating.",1418688000,,155,5.5
8652779,5,B00JPFTWC8,"While the found footage device has become an overused cinematic trope, Infliction harkens back to the subgenre's glory days, resembling films like Cannibal Holocaust that are known for their visceral impact and terrifying ability to blur the line between fiction and reality.
Recalling the most disturbing moments of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, the film centers on two young men who commit several home invasions and film their murders. A motive behind the homicides remains a mystery throughout much of the film's running time - only when the two brothers meet up with their sister (her voice is often heard through phone messages but the actress remains off-screen until the halfway mark) is this tale of vengeance and warped family relations finally clear.
Infliction is less concerned with boogeymen and intangible things that go bump in the night and focuses more on the real horrors that too often exist in our world; the film ends up being much closer to Capturing the Friedmans than The Blair Witch Project. Even the most jaded horror fan, desensitized by stage blood and gore, will find the final twenty minutes of Infliction to be a grueling viewing experience.
