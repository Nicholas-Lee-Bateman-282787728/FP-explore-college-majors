8334100,4,B001PPGAO4,"Not to be confused with ""Top Hat"", this is a b-movie musical from the 1930s made by a minor studio. It's a pleasant movie with some catchy music and some decent comedy. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's fairly enjoyable. Picture quality is fairly lacking, though.",1280102400,,275,4.52
