961384,2,6305075557,"Troma doesn't really know their target audience.  Seems to me they take perfectly sleazy movies and cut out most of the sleaze.  I refuse to believe the director of Rabid Grannies would have filmed copious amounts of cheesy gore simply to have every scrap of it edited out.  Troma's claim that this is the ""director's cut,"" is a load of fiber.  It's almost as if they cut out all the gore so they could fill up their ""EXTRAS"" area.  I suggest avoiding it.",975888000,10,455,4.433734939759036

First off, this movie is VERY badly dubbed and the picture quality is about 6/10... aside from that it's bearable once you get towards the middle of the movie where the gore and all the fun stuff starts. The beginning lags and left me uninterested. It's worth the 9.98 to add to your Troma collection but I suggest another Troma classic before you go and buy this one... say...Tromeo and Juliet.",972864000,,419,4.6

I loved this tender (yeah right) story of two aging sisters who receive a special gift on their birthday from their devil worshiping nephew, and all heck breaks loose.  Lots of blood and gore.

961556,2,6305075557,"It's a serious let down how poorly ""Rabid Grannies"" was treated in its supposed ""HD"" transfer.

I've been a fan of this obscure film for a long time but I never got around to trying to own it since the DVD by Troma was out of print and only in its heavily cut form. But when I heard it was getting a new blu ray release and in its producers cut, I thought ""Hallelujah!""...I thought wrong.

First off, this transfer is pitiful, the video quality is crap and is as bad if not worse than the previous Troma version. What makes it worse are the awful colors in this version, in most of the film, it's blended in a harsh sepia tone and in darker scenes, the blue is so dark, I can barley see anything. I thought there was something wrong with my tv at first, no joke.

Yes it's uncut, great! But with the terrible transfer, it makes it hard to enjoy, especially knowing how it's properly supposed to look like.

It's sad too because I've been collecting horror films for over ten years, I'm a definite horror film buff and I've never complained or thought of the idea of refunding a DVD/blu ray due to the quality....but there's a first for everything.

Overall, don't buy it, if they fix it, great! I'll purchase it again but this time don't get it. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because it is uncut but besides that this a one star product.",1426809600,4,1353,4.26953125

I'm sure some warped minds will like this movie, but be warned, it has little to no redeeming qualities other than being warped, cheesy, and extremely weird.  If you like that sort of thing, it might be OK for you.  For normal people, maybe not.
While I occasionally don't mind watching a Troma movie, just for laughs at the cheesy special effects, and on-purpose bad acting, this one doesn't seem to have the sharp satire that you usually see in a Troma movie, which makes them warped and cheesy, but funny, and sometimes even clever.  This one seems mostly just warped and cheesy.",1383955200,,704,4.384615384615385
961561,3,6305075557,"Rabid Grannies is a very bizarre movie - apparently of Belgian origin but ""set"" in England and dubbed into English post production, it tells the story of two elderly spinsters (who are referred to as aunties throughout the movie, but as the film's title calls them grannies, let's stick with that) who invite all their money-grabbing relatives over for a birthday party, but things descend into madness when a mystery birthday gift turns the two ""grannies"" into bloodthirsty demons!

So lets talk about the film first of all. First and foremost, the script and dialogue make this film a comedy, part unwittingly and part by design. When the head cook sees a demonic granny burst through a door and says ""Oh no - the lobster must have been off!"" (or something similar), then you know this film was made tongue in cheek. But aside from that, the dubbing of ALL the dialogue is completely off kilter, reportedly because the voice actors couldn't find a way to speak normally while trying to match the insane mouthings of the cast on film, but still, the results could have been better than this! No matter, we all like a laugh.

The story itself is little more than a prolonged massacre, as once the grannies transform, all that happens for the remainder of the plot is that all the other characters try and escape, and of course a lot of them die in gruesome ways. The action is all set inside an ornate country house, which at least looks authentic, even if the characters do not.

Now onto the DVD version and the cuts. I'm going to compare the cut and uncut scenes here - so this means the next paragraphs contains spoilers.

The Troma version, it has to be said, is fit for nothing but the trash. With almost all the gore and violence cut out, it's impossible to enjoy the film. The result makes it look like the director didn't know how to edit or stage a scene properly. This is not just ""toning down"" of unnecessary violence, it's the systematic truncation of every single gory scene in such a way that you can't even work out what's happening. I've seen both versions, and only the uncut one makes any sense. Case in point number one: the little girl who's mother tracks her down in the grannies bedroom - in the uncut version, you can work out what's happened. In the Troma edited version, it looks like the little girl is simply sitting quietly beside her auntie, because the cutting removes all the shots that show that she has (unfortunately) been dismembered!

Case in point 2: the smartly dressed man who tries to shoot the grannies. This scene is rendered nonsensical by the cuts. In the Troma version, the grannie approaches him, and then suddenly something (it's unclear what) gets flung down some stairs, and that's it. In the uncut version, it actually makes sense: the grannie cuts off his arm, both his legs and then hoists him up by the means of a spear through the crotch, and it's his body that goes flying.

Case in point 3: The fat man stuck in the cellar. This one is quite nasty  - the granny rips open his leg, eats the skin and then slowwwly pulls the lower part of the leg off at the joint in close up. In the Troma version she just pokes his calf, laughs and then - you see his dead face.

These are the worst cuts, but every single violent scene has them to some extent. Cutting as much as this is inexcusable. The whole point of a film like this is the OTT effects  - that's what the audience has paid to see. Without them, it's just a badly acted romp through a country house with some entertaining demon grannies chuckling every now and then.

So here's my review of the film - amusing and gruesome horror comedy with some wildy over the top violence. The humour takes some of the nastiness out of the many sick ideas.
And here's my review of the Troma DVD; an insulting waste of money, turning an acceptable film into an indecipherable mess.",1355011200,5,3876,4.500711237553343
961562,1,6305075557,The unedited version of this film is a classic and is an easy 10 on the gore scale. This release by Troma is saddly a cut version of the classic. I own the uncut European version of this film and this isn't it. If you've never seen the uncut version of this movie it's still worth seeing.if you have seen the uncut version this edition will only make you angry. Be warned.,1350950400,,372,4.180555555555555
961563,2,6305075557,"Rabid Grannies

The opening is very effectively done, presenting distasteful characters who will be presumably eaten, but then it stews in its own mediocrity for a long time and never really gets into full swing. It builds expectations that are never realized, and it comes off as a major disappointment. If some effort had been placed in character development, clever humor, or special effects, it may have had appeal.

961564,3,6305075557,"Last night I had a Troma double feature. ""Mother's Day"" and ""Rabid Grannies""! I'd say expect the unexpected but you know its Troma so thats obvious! The film is absolutely idiotic in everyway possible! I say that respectfully.. it starts off extremely slow for atleast 30 minutes or more untill the two nice grannies get a present delivered. The mysterious gift is opened and it releases a demonic smoke that tranforms the two grannies into, well... demons! The two newly evil elders reek havoc on their greedy house guest whom are only there to try and get in on the family fortune. Expect poor dubbing, bad audio, bad acting, silly effects and more when viewing ""Rapid Grannies"" and you'll be fine. Remember starts off painfully slow but has its rewards for fans of this type of garbage cinema! Others, you've been warned!

The monsters looked really corny and I thought it was very slow at times. As always, Troma always puts the best extras on there dvds. Worth watching at least once.",1199836800,,342,4.196969696969697
961668,4,6305075557,"Ok, well the first 30 minutes were funny just because all the characters introduced are stupid/funny in their own ways.  The middle part of the movie after the grandmas transform got a little boring for me actually it seemed like there were some holes in the plot, you aren't really sure what happens when people start dying, and people don't die frequently enough or there is not enough gore-humor, or swearing/odd moments what have you, to keep you entertained, but it's ok. I'd say enough ""troma"" stuff happens to keep it going, it ends alright as well but nothing spectacular, with a pretty predictable ending.  Now, what made this movie so worth the whole 5 dollars I spent on it, were the special features.  Specifically, the gore scenes that were cut from the movie (which I have no idea why).  Basically they play all the death scenes how they were originally shot, and pretty much all of them were extended and a ""buttload"" more gory, and should have just downright stayed in the movie, the song played along with them only made it funnier.  After watching the movie by itself I could bear to watch it again with friends for some laughs, but the excluded scenes were where I found what I expected to be in the movie from the beginning, and are what will keep me playing it from time to time.",1195084800,,1300,4.562231759656652

The DVD here has good picture and sound quality with some fine extras like audio commentary by director Emmanuel Kervyn, trailer with trailers to other Troma movies, Troma Intelligence Test, tour of the Troma building, outtakes, deleted gore scenes, radioation march, Troma's EdgeTV clips, a look at ""Terror Firmer"", photo gallery, an interview with one of the original rabid grannies, and more.
