7341955,5,B011T0C60G,"There are no secrets in this, the 21st Century; no private places.
Cellphones, spy drones, and governments that are determined to know everything that goes on all the time and everywhere; we live in an age in which surveillance is a fact of life.
This fact is the basic premise for this outstanding Australian mini-series that details what happens when a video showing the aftermath of a tragic car/truck accident in the Outback finds its way into the hands of a journalist who works for an online newspaper. What happens after the Website publishes the video is terrifying for those of us who still believe that ordinary citizens have a right to privacy and that governments exist to serve the people, not persecute them. Equally terrifying is the length that governments will go to in order to cover up their own illegal activities.
""The Code"" is the story of brothers Ned and Jesse Banks and what happens to them after the video goes online. Ned, the journalist, is determined to pursue the story despite the misgivings of his editor while Jesse, who is autistic with a talent (and obsession) for hacking, is caught up in a police investigation that is part of the government cover-up. He is an easy target for the police because he is known to them, having been arrested for a hacking incident in the past.
The plot and the narrative are excellent but what really made ""The Code"" a 5-star series for me is the acting. There are no weak links in the cast but I was especially impressed with the portrayal of Jesse by Ashley Zukerman and Lucy Lawless as Alex Wisham, an Outback schoolteacher who sends the video to Ned because she wants to see justice done.
An excellent series that features murder, betrayal and government malfeasance; ""The Code"" is well worth watching.",1451174400,9,1773,4.741100323624596

7341958,5,B011T0C60G,"The Code. In this Australian television series, set in the current day, a pair of Canberra-based brothers becomes entangled in a cover up that involves a remote outback community and key members of the Australian Government. Lucy Lawless (XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, PARKS AND RECREATION),  headlines the ensemble cast. David Wenham (TOP OF THE LAKE) and Adam Garcia (COYOTE UGLY) provide able support in this multi-award-winning political thriller. It opens as, deep in the spectacularly fiery red desert Australian outback, two joyriding teenagers have a deadly crash, setting off a chain of events that threatens to  unravel  secrets of the faraway government in the cool corridors of Canberra. Smartphone footage of the accident finds its way into the hands of Internet journalist Ned Banks (Dan Spielman, THE SECRET LIFE OF US); he and his brother Jesse (Ashley Zukerman, RUSH), a brilliant but unstable hacker, become targets in a high-stakes national conspiracy.  The  2 disc box set features 6 episodes running approximately 341 minutes, and, thank goodness, has subtitles for those of us whose Australian lingo is a bit rusty.  I received it as a review copy.  The dramatic thriller comes with 30 minutes of behind the scenes featurettes; it contains coarse language, nudity, graphic violence, is not for the young or the squeamish.

The episodes are:
1. A fatal road accident in the outback kills Sheyna Smith, a young Aboriginal girl; digital journalist Ned Banks gets a major scoop in securing cell-phone footage of the crash. Ned's hacker brother Jesse, possibly a sufferer of Asperger syndrome, discovers that the truck involved was owned by a secretive government research facility; the brothers, whose relationship is at best volatile, suspect a conspiracy.
2. Jesse, who is accused of hacking into the firm Physanto's database, stealing classified files, is held captive, tortured by the firms cybersecurity unit. Meanwhile, Ned ventures to the remote outback town of Lindara, where the accident occurred:  he begins working with Alex (Lawless), Sheynas former teacher, gains startling new insights about the case. The brothers decision to dig deeper into the case drags them into dirty pool politics, the world of black marketers, the international government agencies that monitor and manipulate the black markets.
3. Jesse is released; shaken up and paranoid, he and his suspiciously affectionate new friend Hani skip town to try to take his mind off his captivity. Andy King, vicious  head of Physanto security, goes looking for him.
4. Ned uncovers more of the conspiracy with help from his former girlfriend/former journalist Sophie, now a government public relations person,  and Alex in the outback.  Jesse grows ever closer to cracking the code on the Physanto files. Hani refuses to cooperate with the cybersecurity unit; the government threatens to deport her immigrant family.
5. Ned strikes a deal with the government for Jesse's freedom, agrees to keep all he's learned about Physanto a secret. But a crazed Andy King, desperate to save the multi-million black market deal he had struck for the files, which is faltering, tracks down Hani, takes her hostage.
6. Ned and Jesse  break their deal with the government to help Hani; in doing so, deliver dangerous technology into the black market.  Can anything be done?

Its been a long time since I thrilled to a tale of naughty deeds in high government: its a plot thats been overworked  for a long time now.  But this Australian tale  is fresh, engrossing, gripping: there are  high-tech twists, intrigue; it is serious and purposeful in tone; influenced by the noir outlook of much of current Scandinavian crime fiction.  The photography is certainly striking: the acting is good. New Zealand icon Lucy Lawless (best-known, of course, for XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS), who was born in Kiwi country and resides there with her husband and children, expertly headlines the strong cast. Viewers are likely to find it binge-worthy, as we did in this house.  Good on you, Australia.",1443744000,10,4070,5.221198156682028
7341959,5,B011T0C60G,"Fast pace, scary, complete intrigue. So well done and so believable it will leave you paranoid about government regardless of where you live. Extreme intense cybercrime/ suspense-thriller/ world nuclear threat/ adult mental health/ The CODE has it all, even romance. Larger than compelling--it's addictive. Hats off to Aussie (ABC) TV. They deserve all the awards.

Brothers become entangled in high-level conspiracy when they unwittingly get involved in the cover up of global proportion. Viewers will be white-knuckled before this near 6 hour drama plays out. The incredible story begins with script, then reaches its elevated status by the high performance of the cast. Film footage is as dramatic as the story. Several cast could be praised but none as much as Ashley Zukerman playing the mentally challenged brother, a cyber-genius without social reasoning skills (Aspergers/Autism). His acting elevates the script. Brother Ned is performed almost as well by Dan Spielman. Not far behind are Adele Perovic as Hani; Lucy Lawless as teacher Alex; and Chelsie Preston Crayford as Sophie, a political PR spinner.

7341960,5,B011T0C60G,"'The Code' is a new series by the Australia Broadcasting Corp, written and created by Shelly Birse, that I found on Acorn TV. It looked like an interesting premise, and I latched onto an excellent, well written, superbly acted series. There are 6 episodes in this series, and after episode one, I quickly jumped to episode 2 and so on.

The story begins with brothers Ned Banks, played by Dan Spielman, and Jesse Banks, played by Ashley Zukerpman. Ned is a political journalist for a group called 'Password'. Jesse is a computer whiz who, I believe, has a form of Aspergers. He has been arrested for hacking, and part of his plea deal is to keep away from computers. Ned is well known in the Parliament in Canberra. He receives a phone video about an outback accident and when his company posts it online their lives are threatened. The outback centers on a small town with Lucy Lawless playing the part of a school teacher. She is a part of her student's lives, and two of them were involved in the accident. As Ned looks for the truth he discovers treason and terrorists and everyone's life is in danger. We see the behind the wall lives of politicians and the dirty tricks they play for power.

This is also a view into the life of a hacker, and we get to see exactly how that plays out. Violence plays a part in this series, but it is also backed by extroadinary acting, and a new storyline that is very apropos for today. I understand a series 2 has become a reality, and Series one is going world wide.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-22-15",1440201600,14,1546,4.475177304964539
7341961,3,B011T0C60G,"The Code was made by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (TV station owned by Australian Government), so doesn't really divert into areas commercial TV stations or movie studios would have gone with the same basic script, such as scantily clad women, pointless relationships or anything like that.  Saying that though it does still have some violence, some subtle sex scenes, and nudity (one male character) that is appropriate to the plot (ie part of an intimidation and torture by secret agent types scene), but even that is only shot from behind.  If you were after another Underbelly, or a big budget Hollywood looking TV show, the Code is not it.

A lot of the show is shot in the forecourt of Australia's Parliament House.  There are some scenes in the offices and corridors inside although I have no idea if these were filmed inside the real building, replica built sets or if it even looks like that inside but it was plausible that we were seeing inside the public service offices of the building.  Other sets include the interiors of a few houses, a building with a heap of computers representing an online newspaper, a dirt road with a few steep drops off the side of it, and a few remote buildings in need of a paint job to say the least representing a small town with a considerable percentage of aboriginal citizens, including the only police officer.  Characters work out of a fast food caravan or take walks along side Lake Burley Griffin to remind you they are in Canberra.

I watched the entire season in just two sittings, all the episodes together go for just over five hours. There are also a fair few extras which go for about half an hour, to be honest the show didn't enthral me enough to watch all of those extras.  The basic plot of The Code (some spoilers follow) revolves around an aboriginal boy being discovered covered in blood in the white school teacher's back yard, who doesn't believe he would ever hurt his girlfriend, even though he's not saying what happened.  The girl is found at the bottom of a cliff inside the teacher's four wheel drive.  She steals the boy's smashed up phone from the wreck, even though there is no indication throughout the entire series that the cop is corrupt or anything, but can't get it to play any footage.  Meanwhile an online journalist is given a folder of photographs and information on a rival politician by another politician's media advisor that he used to date .  In it the politician is assaulting a service station attendant, drunk, having an affair and other stuff.  There is also a bit of paper with the name of the small town the dead aboriginal girl is from.  So of course the journalist rings the school teacher since her site is the only contact information online for the town (if you can call a few buildings a town) and she ends up sending him the footage that when his genius but on probation computer hacker brother looks at, shows there was a large semi trailer involved, escorted by two vehicles and one of the passengers from those vehicles pushed the crashed car over the cliff.  This is obviously a much bigger story than the putting dirt on the politician one but there are those who will stop at nothing to make sure it is never told.  The journalist's brother also has problems with social situations, has decided to mail back his meds, and as well it's not stated, but there could be an autistic aspect to his makeup, to add to the hurdles the journalist brother must face if he pursues this story.

I thought the acting by Ashley Zukerman who plays the computer hacker brother was quite good, a lot of time actors playing people with a disability can be quite cringe worthy, but his wasn't. It does help that his character isn't ever labelled with autism or any specific ailment so we don't compare him to actual people with conditions, but I think his performance was well done. The hacking side was of course over the top believability wise, but that always is in any computer hacker storyline. Some of the other actors though (or more important the script they were following) was a bit weak.  Spoilers for some scenes in later episodes - There's a scene where the parents of a girl walk in on a man shoving their daughter's head into a pool and they don't leap the fence (or even try to open the gate) and attack him/save their daughter, they just stand there pleading for him not to kill her.  No parent is going to just stand there, no matter what the risk to themselves.

At one point the brother even points out that you don't need to smuggle USB sticks in diplomatic pouches or anything like that anymore you just upload the data to someone else on the Internet but is told not everything has to make sense to you.  Yet the whole plot continues to play out ignoring the obvious uploading way and revolves around smuggling a USB drive.  At an earlier point a newspaper is hacked and the previous day's newspaper gone with the site showing the one the day before.  Many other news outlets not to mention individuals would have copied the photos and the story the second it came out, the fact the source website was hacked would make it an even bigger story and increase the amount of people sharing it.  No one would try that as a tactic to make a story go away.

Overall it's worth watching, as I said it will only take up just over five hours of your time but it's not this great thriller the hype around it makes it out to be. Not something you'd ever watch a second time either.",1438473600,4,5491,4.539007092198582
