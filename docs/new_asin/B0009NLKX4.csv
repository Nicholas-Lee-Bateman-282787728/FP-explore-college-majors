8063831,5,B0009NLKX4,"This was the first documentary on the Salem Witch Trials I ever saw. It started a continuous journey of research on the subject that continues to this day.  While this might not be the best documentary by way of accuracy ( This came out in 1994 and other documentaries have been done on this topic since then) its a great introduction to what happened in Salem in 1692.  The program itself is interesting, wonderfully filmed in a way that gets the viewers attention, and it never gets graphic. ( The show does include an execution scene which is mostly done in shadow so not much is really shown).

I'd recommend this to middle school teachers, even college professors of American History.  Id also recommend the History Channels documentary entitled "" witch hunt"" Both make excellent teaching materials.",1326153600,,804,4.846715328467154
