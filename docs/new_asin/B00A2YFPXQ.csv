5380121,5,B00A2YFPXQ,Great trip down baseball memory lane. I really enjoyed these classic episodes. I hope more seasons will become available in the future.,1356566400,,135,5.181818181818182
5380122,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Hopefully we will see Season Two in the near future!
It is great to look back at when this was one of the few peaks into the National Pastime we had during the Pre-Everything is on TV era.",1356393600,,188,3.973684210526316
5380123,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Baseball the way it was without wild cards and with winner take all pennant races!!!  In spite of too much astro-turf and gross gaudy uniforms (this was the era of the leisure suit),  this was a great time for baseball.",1355097600,,219,4.45
5380124,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Just received this a few days ago, and what I have watched is excellent. I remember as a kid watching This Week in Baseball before the game of the week each Saturday afternoon. This DVD brought back a lot of fun memories. You see players you may have forgotten about from the days of seventies baseball. If you have a baseball fan in your life, I highly recommend this great DVD. Hearing Mel Allen is worth the price alone!",1354579200,,423,4.367088607594937
5380125,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Despite the abundance of information about baseball available on the internet and on home video, there are surprisingly few ways to learn about what the cultural experience of major league baseball was actually like in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Sure, statistics are interesting, but they generally don't shed much light on the quirky characters that populate the game, exciting pennant races, broadcast technology, uniforms or ballparks of the past.

Even the world series box sets, Ken Burns documentaries and blooper collections only give a hint at what it was like to follow the game in a specific year.  Not everyone followed the Yankees or the Big Red Machine.  What about fan favorites like George Scott or Richie Zisk?  How about the expansion Blue Jays or Mariners?  The summer when the Cubs and White Sox were briefly in first place at the same time?  And who really had the most unusual windup, Luis Tiant or Gene Garber?

The best way to recapture the essence of the past is to experience what people followed to keep up with the game at the time.  Starting in 1977, that vehicle was This Week In Baseball.  Long before there was an internet, cable superstations or ESPN, This Week In Baseball was the principal way baseball fans could go beyond the score recaps on the nightly news or the morning paper to see what was going on around the major leagues.  If you want to learn about baseball in the late 1970s, This Week In Baseball is the best way to do it.  Indeed, as TWIB itself shows, by the middle of the 1977 season, even the players themselves were spotted watching episodes being shown on the scoreboard.  And of course, the episodes themselves are a time capsule of television style, music and technology from the late 1970s.  Many of us even remember watching specific episodes while we waited for rain-delayed ballgame telecasts to resume.

MLB Productions has finally come around to understanding the immense value of its TWIB collection.  This complete first-season collection of TWIB episodes is the first of what will hopefully be a series of releases covering baseball's evolution from the multipurpose stadiums and artificial turf of the 1970s to the retro ballpark and scandal-tainted years of the 1990s.  It makes for absolutely gripping viewing.  Baseball novices will marvel at the gaudy uniforms of the 1970s and the great plays and goofs.  More devoted fans will awe at seeing forgotten players like Mike Tyson (not the boxer), Larry Biitner and Warren Cromartie in live action instead of just faded pictures on creased baseball cards.

For the 1977 set, we see the season unfold week by week as the Chicago White Sox electrify Chicago, only to fall prey to the streaking Kansas City Royals.  We remember that the Yankees and Red Sox closely contested the AL East, but how many remember the Orioles, led by a young Eddie Murray, were just as much in contention?  On the North Side of Chicago, the Cubs played exciting ball, before withering to the Pirates and later the Phillies.  We get to see video of Dennis Eckersley's no hitter as a young pitcher for the Indians.  You will never see all of this together anywhere else - a 425-minute series on the 1977 season, narrated by Mel (""How 'Bout That"") Allen.

As a note, this collection is on DVD-R and is manufactured on demand.  I have played it on a standard, cheap DVD player, and it worked without a hitch.  It's probably true that this collection wouldn't exist in any other form - MLB may not be willing to invest a ton of money in pre-producing a ton of traditional DVDs of an obscure series that it worries may not sell.  Let's prove those fears to be unfounded.

For a baseball history buff, this is a dream come true.  I suspect a lot of other people may feel the same way.  This is an addictive box set that begs to be cotinued into 1978 and beyond.",1354406400,46,3852,4.704477611940298
5380126,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"For those who thought it wouldn't work on DVD recorders, it did on mine, and good quality.  I saw the first two episodes of TWIB yesterday, and it was exciting to see Eckersley's no-hitter (and almost setting a new record for consecutive hitless innings), the first Red Sox-Yankees meeting in '77, Lynn's famous catch in Minnesota, a strange triple play (to end the game, no less), and a tribute to Philip Wrigley, just to name a few.  One can only imagine what the remaining 15 episodes will include.  Too bad the show didn't begin airing at the start of the year.  Anyway, I can't wait for the release of the remaining seasons (Season 2 and beyond).",1352764800,20,651,4.586206896551724
5380137,5,B00A2YFPXQ,This was a great show.  Thankful season one was released.  Please release additional seasons.,1443052800,,93,5.571428571428571
5380138,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Excellent, a trip back to 70's baseball",1435276800,,39,4.714285714285714
5380139,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"It was great to see the first season of This Week in Baseball. I only hope this will lead to the release of more episodes from later seasons. For those old enough to remember TWIB, it was a weekly recap that took the viewer around the league with highlights, bloopers, great plays and personalities. This was, especially the first year of the series, before most of the nation had cable, and the baseball offerings were NBC on Saturday, ABC on Monday, whatever games your local carrier might provide and some of the lucky people with cable who could pick up feeds from New York, Atlanta, Chicago or Oakland.
With Mel Allen narrating, this set brings you every week from the first season. It's a good way to appreciate the 1977 baseball season if you don't remember it and a great way to relive it if you do.",1433462400,,807,4.496598639455782
5380140,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Where is season number 2?  What an unbelievable experience, to go back and relive the year.  The way it unfolds on this show, it's almost like being there.  Mel Allen was unquestionably baseball's greatest announcer of all time, I love his enthusiasm on these shows.  It seems to me Major League Baseball, or whoever it is who hold the rights to these, can easily make them available.  Will they sell millions of copies?  Maybe not, but there are enough of us out here who would buy them, and given that they can manufacture them with so little production these days, there is no excuse as to why they are not on the market, season after season, after season.",1428105600,,659,4.5423728813559325
5380141,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Waiting for Season 2! Great DVD to have! Please, make a Blue Ray version. It is worthy! Awesome compilation.",1427760000,,108,4.7368421052631575
5380142,5,B00A2YFPXQ,You can't go wrong with TWIB and Mel Allen.,1425427200,,43,3.888888888888889

5380144,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Despite what everyone else has said, I took a chance and picked up this tremendous and unique sports time capsule. My Bluray player had no trouble with the fact that these discs were DVD-R and played without any incident. A great watch for any baseball fan.",1421625600,,257,4.608695652173913

5380146,5,B00A2YFPXQ,Loved this show but has anyone heard or read anything about when 1978 will be released?,1410566400,,87,4.5
5380157,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"It's like being a kid again, when TWIB was the main window to bring your baseball card collection to life.  Mel's voice and delivery are a treasure.

This is so good, my Asian wife that hates baseball and won't learn 3-strikes says she doesn't mind watching this with me because it is fast paced and with well narrated stories.

Looking forward to the release of the next years of TWIB.",1407542400,,386,4.485714285714286
5380158,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"This was the ultimate throwback to 1977, in all the best and worst ways.  Most of those stadiums aren't around anymore, as the teams have moved on to newer and shinier surroundings.  Many of the ones that are still around have been remodeled.  The uniforms are almost universally different now, as were the players' fashion choices.  And the video quality was very much 1977 - digital TV was nowhere in sight.  But the game was much the same - hitting, running, pitching, and fielding are the names of the game.  Mel Allen and the TWIB staff did a fantastic job of capturing it week by week, with as much detail on the pennant races, stars, fielding gems, an standout games as they could squeeze into 25 minutes.  I only wish there were more seasons to digest.  Perhaps they will be released someday.",1405728000,4,800,4.584507042253521

5380160,5,B00A2YFPXQ,This is a great piece of baseball . This brings back memories as a kid growing up in Minnesota . I always enjoyed watching the Minnesota Twins when I was younger . I was a huge Rod Carew fan back then. I still enjoy watching the game . I also enjoy listening to Mel Allen do the color commentary in this video set . It is a great set of DVD's!,1398556800,,343,3.8450704225352115
5380161,5,B00A2YFPXQ,I watched This Week In Baseball back in the day. I didn't always get it on the channels I received then. I usually had to wait for rain delays on the Cubs or Braves games before I could see an episode. But boy was it worth the wait. They are well done as any sports highlight show in the history of TV. Mel Allen was perfect for his role as narrator. Great voice and clarity. The highlights were almost always of a positive nature. They show the great plays of the day as well as poking a little fun of the plays not so well done. It's great to go back in time and watch these shows again. It takes me back to my young teen years when life was simple. The players of my youth comeback to life once again and I can remember the way things once were. I hope MLB will continue to release more years of these shows. They truly are a time capsule of great baseball fun.,1397779200,,864,4.02906976744186

5380163,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Few shows run near as long as TWIB and this is where it began. The show has certainly changed a lot since the beginning, but this DVD will provide you with hours of enjoyment and a true piece of baseball history.",1393200000,,212,4.195121951219512
5380164,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"I can watch these fun times of baseball all day! The uniforms of the 1970's and '80's were fun and exciting-- much better than today's dull and boring white/grey baseball uniforms.

I miss those days of major league baseball.",1390953600,,225,4.769230769230769
5380165,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"I have waited a long time for this to be released on DVD.  I grew up watching ""TWIB.""  This was your once a week baseball highlight show.  Mel Allen was great.  The opening and closing music brings me right back to my old house in the 70s in front of the old TV every Saturday.  After  ""TWIB"" the NBC ""Game of the Week"" would air with Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek.  Great memories, great DVD!",1389398400,,392,4.1466666666666665

5380187,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Was glad to see that the early years are being reissued as dvds. I've watched most of the segments and I am having a blast reliving the past. It's amazing how much one forgets as time goes along. Mel Allen was the greatest!

More please!! ;)",1381881600,,241,4.239130434782608
5380188,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"If you are a fan of baseball and 1970s culture in general, you can't beat this collection. A lot of fun to watch the seasons unfold. A Great bargain to boot; $4 a disc, can't beat that.",1380412800,,185,4.027027027027027
5380189,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"I really, really, really hope they come out w/ more of these TWIB seasons. The voice of Mel Allen & the TWIB theme music bring back a rush of memories. This was the best $9.99 I ever spent.!!!!!",1377993600,,194,4.131578947368421
5380190,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Let me tell you, the 70' were the golden age of baseball. And ""This week in baseball"" was the perfect window to enjoy it. Now, 40 years later, we have the opportunity to see baseball as it was then through this window into the past. What a joy!

Watching again those all-time greats like Jim Palmer, Joe Morgan, a young Gary Carter with the Montral Expos and so on is a pure delight. Commentator Mel Allen is funny too.

You'll witness many incredible defensive plays, many funny bloopers. Hours of fun for a true baseball fan. I can't wait the the 2nd season DVD of TWIB to be available.",1377734400,,588,4.385321100917431
5380191,5,B00A2YFPXQ,I hope MLB releases more seasons of TWIB.Just the first season of the show and hearing Mel Allen again just brings a smile on my face.,1376611200,,134,4.1923076923076925
5380192,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Remember the days of riding your BMX bike to the nearest 7-11 for a slurpee and a handful of baseball cards?  How about playing ball in the street with neighborhood kids, emulating the likes of Luzinski and Carew?  This will surely rekindle those memories, brothers.",1375488000,,266,4.888888888888889
5380193,5,B00A2YFPXQ,I really enjoyed watching this video. It allowed me to observe many stars of yesterday. Listening to Mel Allen is great. Observing some of the uniforms from the 70's is equally entertaining. This is a must if you are a casual or hardcore baseball fan.,1372896000,,251,4.6
5380194,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"I've been an MLB fan since 1969 ... and growing up in Pittsburgh, the 1970s were glorious. This DVD has lots of coverage of the Pirates, Phillies, Yankees, Red Sox, Reds, and others. Surprisingly ... a lot of Cubs and White Sox! I'd forgotten how strong they were for at least part of that season.

It was so cool to see the old stadiums, uniforms, and players, just like I remembered them (usually). Mel Allen is corny but classic.

It's highly recommended to have a web browser open with baseball-reference.com to the various teams uniform numbers pages for reference. Can't always tell the lesser-known players without a scorecard!",1369612800,,634,4.861111111111111
5380195,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"I'm a younger fan, so this DVD gives me a chance to see a lot of great players for the first. I've really enjoyed it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes baseball.",1369526400,,168,3.9705882352941178
5380196,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"It is so great to see these old shows again, and hear Mel Allen narrating the highlights. We forget now how cool it was back then to seee a whole half-hour of highlights and great plays from around the league. I hope they keep releasing every season!",1369440000,,250,4.340425531914893
5380217,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Wow - I loved this show back in the late 70's. Long before ESPN and FOX this was the place to ""see"" MLB highlights. It is great to see the classic stadiums, uniforms, great plays, teams, and of course hear the voice of Mel Allen! ""How about that?!"" If you love classic baseball, this is a terrific purchase.",1369180800,,307,4.310344827586207
5380218,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Fun, fun, fun....Nothing more to say. The good old days for sure.  Brings back so many memories. An absolute must see for any baseball fan.",1369094400,,139,4.56
5380219,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"The first season of TWIB is MAGNIFICENT!  It was incredible to see all of the old stadiums, the AWFUL uniforms and Hall of Famers in their prime - Reggie, Johnny Bench, Tom Seaver and many others!  Cap it all off by hearing the terrific Mel Allen in his prime and you have a tremendous piece of baseball history at a great price!",1368835200,,329,4.290322580645161
5380220,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"As a baseball geek and nostalgia buff I was in heaven with this set.  It was so cool to see all of the colorful uniforms and stadiums since demolished.  I really enjoyed watching the exploits of legendary superstars and other guys who had their moment in the sun but have long since been forgotten.  The only complaint is that the season was so short.  That's no fault of the DVD set, but for whatever reason the first season of TWIB started a bit late and wrapped up before the end of the regular season.

Some reviewers have complained about the picture quality, but what do you expect from a TV series aired in 1977?  This was at the beginning of extensive local TV coverage, before every game was recorded, and much of the highlight footage was obviously taken from film. But I really doubt it looked much better even when the show first aired.

The young kids may have issues with the picture quality, but older fans with a taste for baseball days gone by, when the physiques were lean, and the players were clean, this is a ""steal"" at $9.99!",1368057600,,1047,4.450261780104712

5380224,4,B00A2YFPXQ,"I was absolutely animated after hearing MLB  made this series finally available to the public. So many times I had replayed the infamous ending sequence with the footage I can muster to remember along with the TWIB ending music theme, which I found always inspirational and nostalgic.

But my dreams of seeing this in its wonderful glory were severely thwarted after I placed the DVD in the player. I was aghast to see the absolutely HORRENDOUS lack of quality the video has. It is mired in video artifact compressions, especially the red colors. If you take a look (and it need not be a close look) at the edges of the players and other objects, you'll see digital noise.

I expected nothing but the best from MLB, but the transfer/conversion to VOB/mpeg performed for this product was completely subpar.

Sorry to sound so picky. It will not prevent me from seeing the rest of the DVD, and it's still far better than not having it available at all, just wish they had done a better job.

Oct 2013:
I finished seeing the rest of this DVD and despite my previous comments, I was so absorbed that the quality of the video was the furthest thing from my mind. I've renewed my rating from 2 to 4 stars.",1365897600,2,1199,4.506912442396313

5380226,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"WOW!!! This is the long awaited release of the 1977 inagural season of This Week In Baseball (TWIB).  It's outta sight! This DVD set is an amazing walk down memory lane for anyone who is a fan of 1970's baseball with it's wild uniform's, wild hair and wild personalities.  You've gotta love Mel Allen's unique style of delivering the weekly baseball highlights and his trademark ""how 'bout that"".  Hopefully this 1977 TWIB release is the first of many... especially the remaining years of 70's baseball.  It's unfortunate that this series has not been made available until now. It concern's me that I have seen nothing out there to promote this new ""classic"" set... I only stumbled across this in a random search on Amazon.  Friends... get the word out and make this first issue of TWIB a success so that we will be able to see additional TWIB seasons as well as other nostalgic games and series to be made available that have previously been unavailable.",1364860800,,955,4.728915662650603

5380246,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"For people that have never seen TWIB, you're missing out. Everyone who grew up watching sports in the 80s got the benefit of watching in house productions like Steve Sabol's NFL Films or TWIB broadcasts which were a great way to catch up on highlights for the week in the pre-Sportscenter era. The real benefit of having these available season by season is that you can watch the entire thing unfold. By the time you've hit the end of the DVD you've been able to track the ups and downs of the pennant race and really soak in the best parts of the season at a glance.

Personally this would be great if it were available for every season out there. To me though 1987 seems like it would be an amazing season to have TWIB chronicling with the Brewers' 13-0 start,  Paul Molitor's 37 game hit streak, Juan Nieves no-hitter, the amazing rookie season of Mark McGwire, Andre Dawson and George Bell's power surge, Eric Davis' incredible 37 hr/50 sb season, Wade Boggs and Tony Gwynn knocking the cover off of the ball, standout pitching from Clemens, Ryan, Key, Saberhagen... capped off with a World Series between one of the fastest teams of the modern era, the Cardinals (Vince Coleman had 109 steals that year!) and the scrappy Twins team with Puckett, Hrbek and Viola... it was just a really amazing year.",1360627200,2,1304,4.592274678111588
5380257,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Saw the first episode on the DVD, and it was as if my old baseball cards had come back to life!  What memories of that season, and the players during that time!  The footage is not crystal clear (sometimes looks a bit blurry), but the content is awesome and just like I remember watching these with Mel Allen doing the narration week in and week out.  Brings back a TON of memories, and if you were someone who was in their ""teens"" or twenties during the 70's and loved baseball like I did, this is memory lane revisted!

P.S.  Check out the fourth week episode in particular.  To this day, I STILL do not get tired of watching the big blowup between Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson in the dugout where Jackson half-heartedly turns a Red Sox single into a double and Martin has a coronary.  LOVE THOSE OLD YANKEE BLOWUPS!!",1360108800,6,822,4.403973509933775
5380258,5,B00A2YFPXQ,I love reviewing the great baseball moments from the past.  Hopefully there are more of these to come.  Bring it on MLB!,1358985600,,120,4.409090909090909
5380259,4,B00A2YFPXQ,"A brilliant idea to release these through Amazon's disk-on-demand program -- which means, effectively, that those who appreciate classic baseball won't need to convince MLB to spend large quantities for up-front cash before seeing a release.

""This Week In Baseball"" is compiled from videotape and (color) kinescopes of actual game broadcasts -- as opposed to the color film used in the old annual World Series videos, or in all of NFL Films' product. TWIB therefore draws from the best original sources -- most of them lost forever in their complete form. And since it works on a weekly mode, you can follow the ups and downs of each divisional race as they progress through the year.

This being the first season of TWIB, the program starts in May -- thereby missing the inaugural games of the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners.  But this problem is more than offset by the quality of the in-game footage -- often with SportsCenter-like replays of ""web gems"" -- and the revelations described in some of the other reviews here.

Mel Allen's announcing is often hackneyed and grating at times -- sorry, I'm a Vin Scully fan -- but he's at least likeable.  The editing at this early stage is just OK.  But the content by itself earns the four stars -- and I can't wait until we get to even better years like 1978 and 1980. At $9.95 or even $14.95, a real bargain for fans of classic baseball -- you might have seen a little bit of this stuff on the old Classic Sports Network, but not complete and in context like you'll enjoy here.",1358812800,9,1536,4.608058608058608
5380260,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Loved watching the old players I knew better than the current ones. DVD quality is OK considering the age of the video. I hope they release more seasons, I will buy them all.",1358121600,,174,4.303030303030303
5380261,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Reviewer John Corbett wrote the definitive review of this product, so all I want to do is add my voice to those who appreciate this great stroll down memory lane and hope that additional seasons of TWIB will be made available.

I had spent the eight years prior to 1977 overseas (Army brat) and just about the only way to follow baseball at all was to buy baseball cards during the brief time that they were available at the Post Exchange each year. The 1977 season was the first season that I was truly able to follow baseball: I watched the NBC game of the week every week (loved doubleheader days), listened to every game of the 1977 Texas Rangers (their best team until 1996), and never missed This Week In Baseball. Watching these old TWIB episodes is like seeing those old baseball cards come to life and reliving part of my childhood.

Due to my limited access and knowledge of MLB prior to that time, I didn't know that Mel Allen wasn't just the narrator of TWIB. For anyone who wants to hear him as a game annoncer for the Yankees, pick up a copy of the DVD of 1960's World Series Game 7 - legendary Pirates announcer Bob Prince handles the early innings and Mel Allen announces the rest. It's one of the greatest games of all-time with the game's most memorable homerun (sorry, Bobby Thomson) and two great announcers.

As far as the quality of the DVD's is concerned, I had no trouble with them whatsoever - they even played perfectly on my oldest (12 years old) DVD player.",1357862400,4,1485,4.452205882352941
5380262,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"TWIB was MLB answer to the weekly NFL highlights shows that had aired since the 1960's. And they really did a great job with this series. Mel Allen was the perfect choice to host it and while the pennant races are covered they manage to highlight every MLB team through the course of the season. Watching it brought back many memories of that season. In addition you get to see things that could never happen today. One of my favorites was some clips of a Brewers/Royals game where because KC's uniforms had been stolen before the game they had to wear Milwaukee's road jerseys!
Now lets hope MLB can follow this up with TWIB, 1978.",1357344000,,632,4.504347826086956

5380264,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Why has this product been suspended?  Works perfect in my Blu Ray player.  I am guessing for those that it did not work, they are using a bad or out of date DVD player. Get a new DVD player they can be had for less that $50.

Thank you to those who made this DVD.  I never thought that I would ever be able to see this stuff ever again.

In 1977 I was 11, baseball was a major part of my life.  These guys were my heros.  It is amazingly how many Hall of Fame (classic players) played during this era.  It is amazing how much the environment at the ballpark has changed.  You see players falling out of the stands trying to get HR balls.  You see fans mob players on the field.  Love the uniforms (White Sox jerseys with collars, classic Astros, etc.) and hair styles.  Love hearing Mel Allen and watching Mark ""the Bird"" Fidrych pitch.  Still baffled by why Steve Garvey didn't get more consideration for the Hall of Fame.  He was the best player on the great Dodgers teams.  So cool watching Pete Rose, Lou Brock, Rod Carew, George Brett, Montreal Expos, etc.  Being a Detroit Tigers fan, it is great to see Ralph Houk manage some of the old players I grew up watching (Tom Veryzer, Tito Fuentes, Ben Ogilvie, Phil Mankowski, Bruce Kimm, Rusty Staub, Ron Leflore, Steve Kemp, etc) and you don't see much from the 1977 team anymore.  The first seasons of the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays.  Definitely worth the purchase.",1357084800,,1431,4.376425855513308
5380265,4,B00A2YFPXQ,"This is a very nostalgic walk back in time for somebody like me who grew up in the 1970s.  Back then, there were no 24-hour cable sports channels to keep you up to date on Major League Baseball and TWIB and ""The Sporting News"" were weekly ways to keep up to date on MLB.  Mel Allen would take you on a tour of the week's highlights as well as the occasional feature on a player or team.  The video is from 1977 and some of it shows its age, but it is interesting viewing for someone like me who grew up with the show or for somebody wondering how baseball looked and was covered 35 years ago.",1356825600,2,592,4.042735042735043
5380266,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"I have searched ebay for a long time hoping to find someone out there who recorded episodes of TWIB from the 70s or early 80s to little or no avail.  When I saw this dvd was being offered by MLB, I almost jumped out of my skin!  I've watched the first four episodes, and I love it!  Anyone who enjoyed TWIB like I did as a young boy will love this journey back in time.  Mel Allen's voice is just as I'd remembered it.  The week's highlights for each division is awesome.  I find it interesting that MLB actually used 1977s production of TWIB to promote MLB....at the end of each show, Allen urges the audience to make their way to a nearby ballpark for family fun and excitement.  Really neat.  I hope everyone who reads this and is even remotely interested will buy it because I'd love for it to be successful so MLB produces 1978 and so on next!  At $10 for the full season, this is a steal!  Order it now!",1356739200,,909,4.172413793103448

8546407,5,B00A2YFPXQ,This classic show reminds me of the good days when baseball truly mattered amongst my friends. We collected cards and played the game during Summers at parks and in our neighborhoods/communities. T.W.I.B. was always a favorite of ours. All I can say if you were a kid/teen growing up in the 1970's and you love baseball. Buy this dvd. Respects to Mel Allen and respects to those who sequenced the music soundtrack each week back then. Powerful! I hope Season Two will be released soon. Thanx MLB!,1465776000,,496,4.712643678160919
8546408,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"I used to watch this show on Saturday afternoons back in the late 70's through the late 80's, so I was very excited to order this and glad I did, this was the game of baseball I remember, a lot of great players in there prime, this was before steroids with those colorful uniforms, rough stadiums, when fans ran out on the field, fans dropped from the stands, a weekly review of the 1977 season covering all the teams, it's all here with the great voice of Mel Allen. The video quality is not the best but it gives it a charm, the way I remember it on tv and very watchable. I would not want the quality any other way. Rose, Carew, Schmidt,  Brett, Reggie, Yaz, Yount, Bench, Parker, Strargell, Munson, Fisk, Foster, Billy Martin, Earl Weaver, Tom Lasorda, Joe Torre.",1459382400,,767,4.401408450704225
8546409,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"Absolutely loved this!  I wasn't a fan until age eight in 1979, but this filled in a lot of the blanks of what happened before.  I miss Mel Allen and TWIB and an era where baseball was much faster paced and more athletic.  It's all about physical exploits and not about numbers and stats.  I sure hope they come out with the subsequent years, especially 1979!  There is no better regular season MLB yearbook than the TWIB episodes of that year, shown one after the other!  To see TWIB from its infancy was quite revealing as well.",1458604800,,530,4.412371134020619
8546410,5,B00A2YFPXQ,"This is a DVD set that is long overdue. I never missed Mel Allen and TWIB back in 1977. All the great players and great plays are there. Fred Lynn's amazing catches, Lou Brock's steals, towering home runs from Schmidt,Garvey,Jackson,etc.,and all the other memorable moments of 1977. Mel Allen's trademark ""How 'bout that !!"" best describes this collection. I loved everything about the show. The opening theme, closing theme, and all the action in between,including some of baseball's funny or odd moments. Mel packed a lot of action in only 30 minutes. If you are a fan of baseball in the late 1970's this set is for you !",1456358400,,623,4.724770642201835
