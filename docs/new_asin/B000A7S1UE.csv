8075943,3,B000A7S1UE,"It's a decent video. He takes a different slant on the banjo than scruggs. I agree with the above poster NOT FOR BEGINNERS. This is definately for intermediate level people. It's really about improvising. So if you aren't improvising yet, stay away.",1258243200,2,249,4.9523809523809526

8075946,5,B000A7S1UE,"This is a great DVD for any banjo player to own and use.  It doesn't matter whether you play bluegrass or clawhammer, the information in this DVD is invaluable to any banjo style played on a 5 string banjo.  It's not the typcial sit down and learn a song type DVD, it's about learning the basics of the fretboard and building upon the basics to learn and discover more and more possiblities.  I watch this DVD about once a month just to refresh my memory and more importantly, to push myself into new opportunities.  The amazing thing is that I no longer us any tab for learning new songs, I just listen and then figure out the patterns and start playing based on what I've learned from this DVD.",1175558400,11,696,4.372093023255814
