8550242,5,B00ADU28T8,"My kids mentioned they saw the Classroom Fitness videos at school so we got our own copies for home.  It's well done, it keeps the kids entertained and they get a little exercise - I can't ask for much more than that.  I'll be getting a set for my nieces next.",1355184000,,260,4.078431372549019
8550243,5,B00ADU28T8,"Our children's elementary school uses the Classroom Fitness series to provide activity breaks for the kids so we bought it for use at home. The kids thoroughly enjoy the exercises and it is great to record them working on their balance poses (tree). Most importantly each exercise plan is just long enough to get them moving, but not lose their attention.

Great series, love the original music.",1355184000,,395,4.895522388059701
8550244,5,B00ADU28T8,I love when my students do yoga because it calms them down and makes them feel energized. I use these videos with my class in the afternoons when the class starts to get a little antsy or on days when there is indoor recess. It's very quick - about ten minutes - and very safe. There are four videos and they all have different poses except for sun salutations which they all have a few of. It also teaches them good relaxing techniques like how to take deep breaths and close your eyes. The instructor gives some good tips to help the students with the right form. It was just what I wanted and what they needed. Love it!,1354060800,,622,4.235294117647059
