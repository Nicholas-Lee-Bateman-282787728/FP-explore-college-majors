No plot, no explanation of what's going on, just a lot of people (they're supposed to be zombies) with absolutely no make up running around with rubber knives and knocking people down and killing them.

I can not believe this made it to film.

1) What caused the zombies to rise?

2) Zombies using knives?

3) Zombies don't even look dead---they look like raving idiots.

Not one redeeming factor about this movie---not one!

I was looking for a movie to rent and saw nothing, settled on this because the cover looked cool and I love real zombie movies (which this is not!)

I spent $4 to rent it and would have been better off wadding that $4 up and throwing it on the floor.

Do not buy this movie, don't even rent it. If you do rent it, don't bother watching it. It's not even funny, not even stupid funny. I had to give it one star, if I had my choice, I'd have given it zero, it doesn't even deserve to be called a  1 star movie.",1120953600,4,967,4.2349726775956285

If you ignore the poor flim quality and the shaky scenes you still are over whelmed with horrible hip hop music played over and over and over again. It's like they didn't even try, the special effects are horrible, infact so bad that it makes Godzilla look awsome. I've never see such poor acting, was this a joke? Did they think that this would be funny? This film is not even acceptable for an elementary school student.. I wouldn't reccomend this dvd to line your bird cage.. it's not even  that good.",1118793600,12,672,4.508196721311475
2248989,1,B0007XBM16,"The cover of the DVD looks REALLY creepy. It's a scam. Hip Hop horror has become a genre, and this is a terrible attempt to go the zombie route. This is 80 minutes of one woman running away from people with no zombie makeup on, just making silly snarling faces and grunting noises--and each ""zombie"" has bright red blood splashed on its white t-shirt so you know it's been chowing down. In group shots, when the zombies rip store bought meat products out of victims' shirts, some of the actors are either smiling or laughing at how stupid they're acting. It's ridiculous. Oh yeah, the zombies talk every once in a while, too. and they tote guns. And they wield a whole lot of rubber meat cleavers, and you can clearly see them faking the blows of the blade. Storyline? Simply, this woman seems to work at a construction site, gets attacked by the zombies, all her co-workers die, she runs and runs and runs, runs through the woods, finally mentions that she's going to save her husband and get away, and then eventually ends up back at the construction site after being captured several times and tied up by the zombie gang then breaking free while some other unfortunate gets sliced up. this movie is bad. NO redeeming qualities. Also, it's set almost entirely to a hip hop rhythm track. Honestly, don't waste your money.",1116633600,30,1322,4.6059322033898304

2248991,1,B0007XBM16,"It can be if it's a movie called Zombiez...

To call it the worst movie I've ever seen is too good for it. That would be saying that it's a movie in some sense, and I can't justifiably do that. What it most resembles are the stories that kids make up in those last years of elementary school-- you know the ones-- those last years that their imagination is still active and the real world hasn't corrupted their tender minds. This movie has a repetitive, improvised ""story"" style that is very much similar to children at play.

The ""plot"" revolves around Josephine who basically runs from ""zombies"" for 85 minutes. Yeah. That's the plot. No, I am not kidding you. Anything else that happens to pop up in the story is purely coincidental. It does not add to nor take away from the previously mentioned ""plot"" of Josephine running from zombies.

Now... by ""zombie"" I don't mean the guys you see on the awesome looking cover.... heavens, no.  These zombies are a bunch of happy smiling and/or grunting guys that look like the guys you might see sitting by the drink machine outside Piggly Wiggly on any given day. And no: They never realy look much different than that. They sometimes have blood on their faces that looks a lot like that red sweet and sour sauce I get at the china buffet, but that's about all the makeup effects that really happen in the movie. And in just a few brief moments of viewing the ""film"" you'll notice that there are actually more happy zombies in this movie than the rotten, mindless kind you find in most zombie flicks.

Now, as far as ""special effects;"" well... the movie... kind of doesn't really have any. Yeah.  Well... Ok. There is this one scene where Josephine makes a Molitov Cocktail and throws it at the zombies.

Well... who knew Molitov Cocktails created smoke but no fire? Crazay! It seemed to burn the zombies anyway, so who cares, right?

But by far the real concern of the film was obviously the thing the director focused on more than anything else: Josephine's butt. I'd say a good 65 minutes of the 85 minute long movie the screen was filled with Josephine's ample bottom. It was like some reverse nightmare. Death by getting too much of a good thing.

This movie is a blacksploitation movie made by black people. I have no doubt that the KKK bought the bulk of the production run of this movie to spread their assumption that African Americans are obsessed with big butts and fried chicken. I say the fried chicken part because of one scene near the end of the movie that makes absolutely no sense.... at all.... and that's saying something when that pops up as a significant point in a turdfest of a film like this....

I give this -65 stars.

But, man... It is definately worth buying, if just to own a copy of something so uniquely horrible.  I got it as a Christmas gift this year, and honestly it is one of the most treasured items I own.  No, I haven't watched it over and over again since I got it.  I actually only saw it once.  But I stick by my point that owning something like this is an honor.  Buy a copy for a friend today!!!!

Or maybe someone you hate.

Did I scare you, if so you can probably still handle Zombiez.  Seriosly, this has got to be one of the most offensive attempts at making a zombie movie ever known to man...House Of The Dead 1 & 2, Children Of The Dead, and Day Of The Dead 2 Contagion are all masterpieces compared to this crap.  I'm about ready to boycott all of Lions Gate's straight to video horror releases, they all suck horse balls, it's like they don't even watch their own movies before releasing them.  Lions Gate has been consistently been putting out some of the best theatrical horror pics to date, so what gives?

2248993,1,B0007XBM16,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I am a zombie horror film

enthusiast and I love cheesy b-movie zombie horror. However, you can't

even call ""Zombiez"" a movie. It is the worst piece of garbage that I

have ever seen. The creators must have spent their budget on malt

liquor and then hired people off the street. There isn't any acting in

the film and the camera work is awful. They couldn't even afford zombie

makeup or special effects so it's just a bunch of people running around

with fake plastic butcher's knifes and axes and when they get to their

victims they attempt to fake ""hit"" them and then the scene cuts to

""zombiez"" pulling what looks like raw chicken and beef out of ""corpses""

with no blood or cuts on them. As if this wasn't bad enough the plot

(if you could call it that) falls apart and the film goes from just

plain awful to the worst film I have EVER seen. How could anyone even

put this into production and release it for public viewing?!? It is a

shame to the zombie horror genre, the people who released it should be

ashamed of themselves for such garbage.",1138752000,4,1097,4.334975369458128
2248994,1,B0007XBM16,"Now if you just spend your hard earned money for this movie, i

suggest you look at it in fast foward and then put it away in

never been made. None of the characters are interesting and the

acting of the zombies is pitiful and embarrassing for any true

zombie fan.",1138320000,11,329,4.0625
2248995,1,B0007XBM16,"I first want to say that I love cheesy horror movies. I saw the cover and wasn't expecting anything like Dawn of the Dead, but just a cheaper and fun zombie flick. Holy crap what a terrible movie. Worst acting I've ever seen. I thought Bruce Campbell sucked in the first Evil Dead, but man. I have liked every zombie film I have ever seen (from I Walked with a Zombie in the 1930s to White Zombie, Plague of the Zombies, and everything else). Second, there are no rules for these zombies. Sometimes they talk, sometimes they snarl, they run, use weapons, occasionally speak very clearly, and have no makeup. I often wondered when I was looking at a zombie or a regular person. Third, if any prop/effect is overused in an independent film, it is fake blood - yet there is little to be found here. Just sausages for intestines/any part of the body being eaten. My favorite scene though is where the zombies (if that's what they even were) were killed by a Molotov cocktail that involved lots of smoke. No fire. Just smoke...

I'm not even done watching it. My wife is begging me to turn it off. I have never disliked a movie enough to flame it on the net while I watched it! Jeez. Amateur is fine, but this is pathetic.",1128988800,6,1217,4.384955752212389

2248997,1,B0007XBM16,"But even though this movie is completely devoid of any redeeming value, you can still learn some important facts:

A sickle is a surprisingly common weapon for zombies to use.

Zombies find it amusing to hide, throw rocks at you, and laugh.

If surrounded by a group of 8 or more zombies, wave a meat cleaver in their general direction and they will scatter.

Zombies eat nothing but your guts, and only when you are wearing a shirt that covers the wound.

Not only do they not decay, they are even aware enough to clean up between feedings.

When the time comes for the final battle with the zombie leader, it should take the form of a co-ed boxing match.  Seriously.",1125964800,7,668,4.471074380165289
2248998,1,B0007XBM16,"This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is Oscar-worthy by comparison.  Watching a blank TV screen would have been more enjoyable.  I am, unfortunately, one of those people who has to read an entire book, never walks out on a movie and keeps living in hope that the plot will suddenly develop and this piece of tripe will make sense!  It doesn't happen.

I don't have any idea who the people are that were in this movie (I refuse to call them ""actors""), but their next jobs should involve something that would improve upon their acting skills - Wal-Mart greeter comes to mind.

Being a zombie movie fan I picked it up. Yeah...I honestly thought it was a Chapelle Show skit and he was going to be playing a funny zombie Tyrone Bigums or something. Actually...no that would be insulting the quality of his show. Unlike the cover these aren't the traditional ""undead"" zombies we all know and love. These are the old voodoo zombies that have mystical $1.99 Spencer's gifts fake knives that, I'm guessing, welt the victim to death (I'm sure some of you've been hit by one of the fake knives and let me tell you it hurts, I couldn't imagine have voodoo zombies barely hitting me with them repeatedly). Then to add insult to injury after they kill you they eat their lunches, (that they obviously had in their pockets or in a brown bag) on your tummy. I would recommend this to people who are blind...and deaf, or someone who doesn't have a TV or DVD player and is in need of a door stop...or frisbee...or maybe a coaster for drinks...

8053603,1,B0007XBM16,"Zombiez (2004)
 Zombiez could have been the first hip hop Zombie flick to grace the screens of Zombie film fanciers.  Instead it is an incoherent mess that consists mostly of watching the star, Jenicia Garcia, flee from bad guys through buildings, along roads or through the woods.  Twice she is captured by the Zombies only to escape.  The viewer is mystified until late in the film as to the exact nature of the purported Zombies.
 Familiar Zombies are not generally thought to be able to achieve full mobility.  These Zombies do.  They also speak.  They also use weapons to subdue their prey.  These are un-Zombie like traits. After a long and frankly boring time we discover that the bad guys are not Zombies at all, but cannibal meat pie vendors.  We are directly lied to in the title of the movie and in the set up in the early part of the film, which claims to be a Zombie movie.
 One 14 year old reviewer opines that this is the worst movie ever made, or at least the worst Zombie movie. I find it hard to improve on this assessment.  The thing seems to have been made without a script.  The scenes with more than one person in them seem to be completely improvised.  The dialog is inane and nonsensical.  The props are obviously from Halloween costume accessories.  I think that Garcia may be able to act, if she is given a coherent acting assignment, but that cannot be said of the other actors involved in this travesty of a movie.
 This 2004 film runs one hour and 32 minutes which is about one hour and 32 minutes too long.

8053606,1,B0007XBM16,"I have seen many awful zombie films in my life. Films like House Of The Dead, Dead Heist, Night Of The Living Dead 3-D, Return Of The Living Dead 4 & 5, Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium and Day Of The Dead Remake. But this is really the worst one I've ever seen. I thought Uwe Boll was a hack director. But ZWS is one HELL of a bad director.

I've seen little kids did way much better with their home movies with their toys and imagination then this grown hack with his toys and his imagination. And I do mean toys.

The cover is very misleading. The zombies look like walking corpses on the cover. Instead, they're really humans who walk like that have bad hemeriods. The carry plastic sickles and butcher knives you can get for $3.99 at any store. The laugh, they play stupid jokes, act like humans and talk like humans.

You can easily tell that the gore looks like sausages, hot dogs and other types of food. There's even a scene where the film's heroine throws a motolov cocktail at the zombies, and their bodies are not on fire. All you see is smoke made from dried ice and the bodies look clean.

The acting is horrible, even for a grade ""F-"" film. The DP work is pure garbage. The film score is really annoying and horrible. All I can say is that you can drink 10,000 cans of beer and you won't find no good in this film. Even with some really bad films out there, you can find something good in it. But you can find nothing goo in this film. I'm warning everyone, avoid this film like it was the plague. In fact, the plague sounds more intereting.",1218585600,,1552,4.215488215488215

8053608,1,B0007XBM16,"I am speechless after viewing this one, so let's get right to the review...

1) ACTING: The acting really wasn't all THAT bad. There were a few individuals that could have taken a few more acting classes, but no one was REALLY bad. The lead actress was very good.

2) PRODUCTION: Amazingly enough, I found the production values on this surprisingly good...to a point. Just an observation, but it makes me wonder if this movie was actually shot in order with the script. As the movie progresses, the production values started to suffer. Shots that were properly lit and focused and very tight, now have gone down in quality. Near the end of the movie, there was nary a drop of blood to be seen, even though people were stilled being killed off. It made me think that since the budget for the movie was going down, so was everything else. So, when the producers got to the ending scenes of the movie, it appeared that money had run out and they were making do with what they had. While I'm sure that many movies suffer from this, sadly, it was painfully noticable. And the soundtrack, while it was not the latest hip-hop songs I had thought it might be, (and it wasn't heavy metal music. YAY!) it seemed like someone sat down at a music machine, recording a few tracks sounding like ""an urban beat,"" and palyed it over and OVER AND OVER. And my only real continuity gripe was the heroine seemed to forget when her ankle was sprained / broken except when the scence called for it.

3) SPECIAL EFFECTS: Very disappointing. I know low budget movies have to improvise and make do, but...it just gets very old and repetitive when a zombie reaches UNDER my shirt to kill me and pulls out my guts (which consisted of a bag of leftovers from the local butcher shop) time and time again. A zombie's make up consisted of having some blood on its face and having some blood / dirt on its shirt. And the weapons that the zombies used must have been gotten from the local Halloween store. Plastic knives, cleavers, swords...at LEAST for the close ups, real ones should've been used.

4) ZOMBIES / ZOMBIEZ: This was the biggest let down of all. The zombies in this movie are not zombies at all. They are more like psychopaths with cannibalistic traits on the loose. They use weapons, they talk, they taunt their victims, they run away from the police, they follow the words of their leader, they torture people. This movie should've been called ""PsychoZ"" or ""CannibalZ,"" not ""ZombieZ.""

5) THE CAUSE: It was over an hour before any revelation was made as to what exactly was going on in this movie, relating to all these people being killed, and to why the zombies were attacking. Which still didn't really explain HOW the zombies came to be...

6) NUDITY: One brief scene of a totally nude female victim laying on a table.

7) SPECIAL INTEREST: I will not even begin to explain the guy dressed up as a giant yellow chicken.

Avoid this one. This one isn't worthy of a rental. If it was on the sci-fi channel, I would turn the t.v. off. Seriously. I would rather watch Day of the Dead 2: Contagium again. And that's saying a LOT.

RATING: 0.5 out of 5 (for the production values)",1193875200,2,3163,4.496515679442509
8053609,1,B0007XBM16,"I bought this one because I saw the trailer and it looked good.  Unfortunately the trailer contained the only good scene in the movie.  The movie starts with definitions of zombie so that we get the idea that traditional zombies aren't really dead.  Our first view of them is when two zombies wielding a cleaver and a sickle attack a guy at a shipping yard that is twenty miles from the nearest working plumbing (or so the captions says, believe it or not).  We then follow the plight of a young woman who works at the yard (which is in an industrial area and has a bus stop out front).  She is attacked and runs away to her apartment with her husband.  The zombies follow her and abduct them.  She wakes at the shipping yard and escapes.

Now it gets even stranger.  She runs away and winds up in the woods beyond some really high mountains.  She is chased by more zombies who happen to be running around in the woods.  She returns to the shipping yard where she tries to rescue her husband (she was looking for him in the woods).  Then the plot falls completely apart until the end.  Each phase of the story starts out with more definitions that I guess are supposed to help us understand the main character better.

These zombies use weapons and some of them talk.  The effects are ridiculous at best.  The opening zombie attack has the victim hid a dozen times by the cleaver and the sickle and yet there is no blood or wounding and he keeps fighting back and yelling even though he should be in little pieces.  We don't really know who the zombie master is or why he is doing what he is doing.  We don't know why everything seems to happen at the shipping yard or why the woman keeps going back there (except the time she is looking for her husband).  The geography of the movie makes no sense.  The plot makes no sense.  The appearance of the zombies at every turn makes no sense.  Production values are almost nonexistent.  The only high point was when a big zombie asks a naked woman with a hole in her belly why she won't just die (and if that is the high point you know how bad the rest must be).
