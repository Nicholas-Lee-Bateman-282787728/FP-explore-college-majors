1647152,4,B00005QBYT,"NAKED STATES is a fascinating documentary about New York photographer/artist Spencer Tunick as he embarks on his ""Naked States"" tour, getting people from every state to shed their clothes all for the sake of art. Tunick just picks regular people off the street to model for his photos. You've got to admire these people; figuratively speaking, I wouldn't have the balls to do something like that. Not surprisingly the moralists manage to get him arrested in several states for ""aiding and abetting disorderly conduct"". Ironically, Tunick is listed on the DVD profile as being ""notoriously private""! And despite his hunger for publicity he doesn't want the tabloids to cover his art as he feels they will cheapen its merit!
Even just seeing the different backgrounds and personalities of his subjects is fascinating. There's an amusing scene of a tough biker guy getting aggro at Tunick when Tunick asks his daughter to pose for him, and another subject is a rape victim being photographed as part of her healing process. One photo even shows the twin towers of the WTC in the background (Yes, I DO notice other things when there are naked women in view!). It's also good to see that Tunick is willing to strip too to get his work done, as we see when he photographs several thousand people at a Phish concert. The finished pictures look amazing. I found it funny how the news item on the doco censored the nudity- especially when on any other day you see gruesome war footage and the like. This would probably never happen in NZ (Unless the artist was Maori, Helen Clark just can't say ""No"" to them). NAKED STATES is highly recommended. The only extra with the Australasian DVD is a written profile of Tunick, but it's still worth seeing.",1049587200,10,1738,4.777408637873754
1647153,5,B00005QBYT,"While good reviewing technique seems to suggest that ones should write a summary of the item being reviewed, it seems unlikely that you'd be here if you didn't know what Naked States is about, so, just this quick summary: Spencer Tunick road-trips through the contiguous 48 states photographing nudes in public, and this documentary follows him, his girlfriend, and occasional crew through the process.
The result is, indeed, captivating. Tunick manages to take public nudity, an almost completely taboo subject, and make it accessible to a wide audience. This is no peep show for sexual gratification: it would be a waste of money and time, and devalue one of the most worthwhile aspects of the documentary and Tunick's work: the human body is beautiful, and fascinating, and both works manage to make the body something to be considered, and viewed as art, rather than something to be ashamed of, and run from. That said, if you or your viewing partners are easily embarassed by nudity, proceed with caution, as nearly every scene contains it.
One interesting difficulty encountered in reviewing a 'docudrama' such as this is whether to focus on the documentary, or the underlying subject matter. I'm mostly writing about Spencer Tunick's work, i.e., the subject matter, but it's worth noting that the documentary quality is high, maintains the viewer's attention, and doesn't rely too heavily on the 'shocking' nature of the subject matter to surprise, but rather presents it in an even-handed way, and allows the viewer to go along for the ride.
Other, minor, notes/gripes: the brief interviews with Tunick's girlfriend, who seems to comfort some (many?) of the females who are solicited to have their pictures taken nude, were too brief. She seems to occupy a tense space in this venture: Spencer as occasionally ego-driven, occasionally humble artist; she as foil, legitimacy, grounding device.
Perhaps too much time was spent on a few major events/places (it seems that almost half the movie was spent in three places: the Phish concert, the nudist colony, and Burning Man.) Burning Man provided an interesting visual contrast, though: the documentary camera focused several times on the huge sign that reads ""NO SPECTATORS"", while we, as documentary viewers, are exactly that. It also provided an interesting glimpse into this rarely-reported festival in the Nevada desert, though this wasn't apprently a major purpose.
As a photographer, I found the color, real-life models and their beautiful surroundings, and the edited-in, black-and-white final photographs of them to be a fascinating contrast. (Which goes to the eternal struggle of the photographer: how to make something stay real and vibrant in still-motion.)
The additional, and much more raw, documentary included as a DVD extra was also interesting, and worthwhile viewing. It included nealry a start-to-finish photo shoot in Central Park's Strawberry Fields, and lots of gushy comments about how the model-particiapnts think John Lennon would've approved of Tunick's work.
Overall: a VERY worthwhile view, which will make you think, and laugh, and give you plenty of conversation fodder. (I checked it out from the library, but I wouldn't have been disappointed had I paid for it.)",1041811200,10,3252,5.255769230769231
1647154,5,B00005QBYT,"Spencer Tunick is everything that the perfect nude photographer is: a charismatic showman, a gentle pastor, a geeky college kid, a social/political activist, a kid in a sweetshop who jumps for joy when he bags the perfect photo or gets a glowing report in a high-profile newspaper.
As a budding nude activist in the unlikely city of Brisbane in Australia who is into nude photography and a Christian, I believe that Jesus Christ had it right when he said 'nobody can understand God's Kingdom unless they are born again'.
Naked States is a film that shows how Tunick has been able to give his subjects a new outlook on themselves, to help them go within and be the people they want to be and need to be.  From the raped black girl, the 65-year-old man, the rock concert promoter, the blonde daddy's little girl to his own lawyer prepared to let Tunick photograph him naked....Tunick doesn't have to justify or analyse his work.  His subjects do the work for him.
And at the end of the day, the only people that I feel are the true hypocrites are the nudists themselves.  They talk about freedom, acceptance, enthusiasm and respect - yet they showed none of that towards Tunick for his first subjective brush with nudism.  A shame.
Don't give up your day and night job, Spencer.  God knows the world needs you whether it thinks it does or not.",1033689600,2,1341,4.594142259414226
1647155,4,B00005QBYT,"I'd give it a 3 1/2 if that rating was possible because I thought it needed something. The documentary starts with Mr. Tunick getting ready for a five month cross country tour at his family home in New York and follows him on his journey as he photographs individuals and groups of people nude, sometimes in very public places.
I'll never know how the guy can keep avoiding jail time for his efforts but they are really interesting, some of them quite good. I found him to be a little whiny at times but my biggest complaint is that the film maker just seemed to zip through many of the scenes, some of them I couldn't get any real sense of what the resulting photographs would look like. I can understand how he was able to get one or two people to pose in some small town out of the way places at an early morning hour but New York City with a street full of nude people, now that was really something. Young (only one or two babies, no children), Old, mostly white but some black, slender or very large, all are represented by Tunick and seemed happy to do it for him, even those who didn't know the guy.  The main program ends with a showing in a New York gallery, some of his subjects were there still proud of his efforts, and several magazines formerly not interested were paying attention to Tunick's work now.
The film and short film were good, the short perhaps helped by being so brief. I didn't have much use for the photo gallery, some of the stuff done in the documentaries was better.
Some of the photo subjects talked about how liberating it felt to pose nude, wonder how many of them have participated in anything nudist since that time?",1029542400,11,1654,4.37012987012987
1647156,4,B00005QBYT,"Should be the real title of this documentary.
I'd known of and admired Spencer Tunick's works for many years.  He captures beutiful images of the nude from.  Conveying intense messages.
As a documentary, it faithfully records the time spent with Mr Tunick, his SO and crew.  Showing what they go through to get the shot.  Shining the unwinking eye of the camera on not only the process, but the people involvled.
Which means we find out that Mr. Tunick whines his way through life, he's inarticulate about what he wants his vision to be and when folks don't get it, he gets angry.
During the documentary we met and talk to several of his models, one larger lady is having a very moving personal moment about how being a model was a wonderful experience and how good she felt in her heart and mind.  If Mr. Tunick, ever saw that, he didn't show it, looking at her simply as prop to contrast against the thin black lady.
As a photographer and a nudist, I did wince with him when he was photographing the Nudists.  A photographer without his pockets is lost and the childishness of the nudists has no excuse.",1028246400,,1105,4.5
1647157,4,B00005QBYT,"Spencer Tunick set out to photograph naked people in all 50 states, and completed his mission in five months. This HBO documentary that runs a little over an hour records his journey. The photographs range all the way from single individuals and a few  people together to as many as a thousand nudes in one photo shoot. Mr. Tunick takes in a biker rally, a Burning Man celebration, a meeting of naturalists-- apparently the group that was the least cooperative-- and a Phish concert.

Some of the photographs are quite good; others are trite and far too cute and gimmicky. What is so interesting about a naked very pregnant white woman standing with a poor black man, fully clothed, beside his grocery cart full of cans and other things he has collected? Or two women embracing while they stand on a large American flag? And does a rape victim need to let me see her naked? She tells the documentary maker that doing these shots was great therapy for her. Not everyone's lives have to be made public.

The photographs that work best are the ones where hundreds of people are lying down in open spaces. They become something else besides naked people and call to mind some of the photographs of Edward Weston when he shot nudes that look like vegetables and/or fruit. Sometimes they take on the quality of the masterful work of Sebastiao Salgado, no small feat.

People, particularly Americans with our Puritan heritage, will always be fascinated by the naked body in any way it is presented to them. Mr. Tunick says in this documentary that he wanted to do something new and different with photographing nudes-- although I read that he wants to be called an artist rather than a photographer. Okay. Certainly the German photographer Henning von Berg did something similar on a smaller scale when he photographed nude men in Berlin in 1999. Of course he didn't get arrested for his actions as has Mr. Tunick several times in New York. And while this artist may photograph a nude woman in a pubic place with a snake on her head for its shock value, Joel-Peter Witkin many years ago established himself as the grand master of the macabre as it relates to the naked body.

Apparently most of the models get quite a kick out of baring it all. One man interviewed described the phenomenon as giving the third finger to oppressive society. The artist, as I understand it, has also attempted to make statements about both HIV/AIDS (by photographing people who are HIV positive without clothes) and keeping the planet green.

These photographs would work best either seen in a gallery or in a catalogue, and some of them are worth seeing again and again.",1208908800,2,2645,4.70194384449244
1647158,5,B00005QBYT,"I purchased both this DVD and Naked World after participating in a Spencer Tunick photo shoot in Miami Beach,FL this past Oct. 2007.
It was interesting to see how far he has come in being accepted in the art world. The photos he takes are not pornographic.
I also found it funny that he had such a hard time in the biker setting. Bikers are thought of as being very permissive and when he was trying to find a model to pose I thought he was going to get punched in the face!
He does not want people with ""perfect"" bodies as his models just every day people who are a little adventurous.
Note how uncomfortable he is when he is naked at the clothing optional resort.",1200096000,3,665,4.244094488188976
1647159,3,B00005QBYT,"There are moments of undeniable beauty and grace in witnessing some of the transformative tales of those who freely posed nude for photographer Spencer Tunick during his five-month trek across the United States. One man communicates his own epiphany post photo shoot by noticing that being naked doesn't really reveal who a person is - it's the clothes, rather, by which a person defines himself.

In elevating his work above porn, Tunick often photographs the nude in large numbers. Placing the subjects against the background of daily life, amid urban streets or modern architecture, and in glorious black and white, some moving and timeless images have been created. The body of work Tunick has produced through this documented project alone will serve as noteworthy in the timeline of 21st century artisans.

Overlooking pacing and editing, the film (which oftentimes resembles an episode of MTV's ""Road Rules"") stands as a testament to artistic integrity and persistence of vision. -Thomas O'Connor",1188432000,,1003,5.30188679245283

We had 1800 models (including a former Congressman!) show up and pose naked at the Central Terminal in Buffalo NY August 15, 2004, with as many aged over 50 as under 30 (a first, we were told).  I have never seen so many people so happy to be anywhere.  Overheard:  ""I knew I'd run into someone here from work - why did it have to be you?""

1647163,5,B00005QBYT,"Profound and astounding, Tunick's work is less about nudity and liberation than it is about the metaphors that emerge in the juxtaposition of the exposed and vulnerable human animal against various backdrops, both natural and unnatural. If you want to buy this item because you seek ""tasteful"" sexual titillation, you really should consider purchasing real pornographic images to satisfy those desires instead.

1647164,2,B00005QBYT,"It says a great deal about how tone deaf our culture is that a charlatan artist like Spencer Tunick is actually a legitimate subject for a documentary. Nudity is his cause celebre, but its being culturally risqu&eacute; after 1970 is simply a joke. It was certainly was wild, crazy, and verboten back in 1910, but today? Heck, now it's practically a civic requirement. Believing that taking one's clothes off in public is somehow avante garde is merely a reflection of just how clueless and insolated pseudo-intellectuals like Tunick are. They think that people in America are out banning Ulysses in their spare time and that the mass of us are extras from the movie Footloose. Tunick is woefully nave about the general population's attitude towards sex. Pornography has entered the mainstream in this new millennium and cannot easily be separated from the rest of entertainment. One has to feel sorry for the confused individuals who actually buy the idea that stripping is liberating. It certainly would be if you're an exhibitionist, but for the average person it is merely a sign of a pathetic longing for attention. When one subject states (in all seriousness): ""this shoot is 90 percent of my self-therapy,"" it is hard not to laugh out loud; although, perhaps Tunick will dub his next film, ""Taking it all off for Freud."" That anyone could actually consider a no talent like this as someone with something to say is a sign that pose, as opposed to merit, is integral to notoriety in the world today.",1138924800,14,1505,4.8599221789883265
1647165,5,B00005QBYT,"Spencer Tunick is a man who goes all over the United States to find people to pose butt nude in public weather it's a man or woman, they have to lay on the ground and not smile. He got arrested in New York for having thousands of people naked right in the middle of Times Square in the morning. I love this dvd I'm just waiting for ""Naked World"" Spercer's other documentary.",1119484800,3,374,4.208333333333333
1647166,5,B00005QBYT,"I found out about Mr. Tunick's work from an article in Wired. The photographs are interesting studies in how the human body can be used to create a unique work of art. I found the documentary to be very interesting as I got to see how such work is accomplished and the kind of difficulties that he has experienced in New York City with those who would consider the nude human body to be obscene or something that needs to be covered at all times.

It was also great to be able to listen to the actual participants of these events and get their reactions to the whole experience and how liberating it was to pose nude for Mr. Tunick. It was especially touching listening to the poor lady who had been physically attacked 6 months prior to the photo shoot and how posing nude for Mr. Tunick was therapeutic to her and helped her to regain a positive self image of herself.

I also have to give Mr. Tunick a medal for his courage to ask people to pose for him at a biker convention. This part of the film was an excellent documentation as to how people have such pre-conceived notions of the nude human body and the negativety he experienced until he became better known.

I hope that Mr. Tunick decides to do a photo shoot in my neck of the woods soon as I would love to be able to pose for him. By the way, he has a official website where you can provide your email address and sign up to be informed of upcoming photoshoots and maybe pose as well.

Definitely I recommend this DVD. I hope the sequel ""Naked World"" is released in DVD format as well soon. I would love to see the one about the shoot in which there were 7,000 partipants. It must have been an amazing experience to behold.",1096848000,14,1686,4.259375

7950132,4,B00005QBYT,"When Spencer Tunick arrives in North Dakota he enters a shop seeking
models for the next day. He encounters a pleasant woman named Teri
and she appears willing to pose but displays a slight hesitancy saying
she'll think about it and will let him know when he calls her later that
night. She then sits at a table with a male and female friend. The male
questions why she would consider posing nude. He says, ""Aren't you afraid
that he might, like, take the photos and sell them to some, like, Asian porn rings?""

That remark and viewpoint, either flippant or well-considered, typify a
large percentage of the American public. A sad comment on not being able
to see a human body as something we all have without equating it to the
word ""porn"". A little later in South Dakota at the Sturgis bike rally Mr.
Tunick is cursed at and insulted by a man after his female friend is
politely asked by Spencer to pose nude.

This documentary captures the ending of twentieth century America with a
photographer and his crew traveling across the United States photographing
at least one nude person in each state. Not all of the states are shown but
Mr. Tunick did work in each state on his odyssey. When the cross-country
project begins he is relatively unknown and at the end of the documentary
where he has an art gallery show about a year after his travels ended he is
more widely known to the public thanks to the exhibition and the notice of
various publications.

The film opens with his arrest in Times Square while photographing a
large group of nude citizens in the street. His attorney, Ron Kuby, states
that he has to go to trial rather than just plead guilty or pay a fine. This is
important. Mr. Tunick will be arrested multiple times pursuing his art
involving nudity in public. In ensuing years he has become a hero to us
photographers who sometimes photograph nudes in public. His battles
don't grant everybody carte blanche to be nude everywhere in the USA
but they do represent a voice for First Amendment freedom of expression.
Had he backed down and paid a fine it would have made it easier for much
more harassment than what he has had to endure.

My rating for this dvd is four stars. It does not delve into the
inspiration or motivation for the idea to travel to every state in the
United States with the goal of photographing at least one nude
person in each state. The logistics involved with getting a crew
together to pursue that goal are not revealed. It doesn't go into any
details about how Mr. Tunick began photography and when he first
gravitated to the nude in public, although in a filmed fragment while
on the road he states that there are a million photographers photographing
nudes in nature amid forests and beaches and parks. To distinguish
himself from them he has chosen the pavement. But when and how
did he come to that decision? Mr. Tunick comes from a long line of
professional photographers but this is never indicated.

I first became aware of Spencer Tunick around 1993 when a model
gave me a vhs tape she'd made of an HBO episode of Real Sex. The
segment entitled ""Naked City"" depicted Spencer photographing three
or four people on the streets of New York City. At that time there was
nothing that told of his decision to do urban nudes. And in this
documentary there is little that really goes much beyond the superficial
events on the road as the tour goes on. I'm not sure the film even states
that this tour is being done in 1997. In the intervening years when and
why did he become more dedicated to obtaining larger and larger
groups of people at one time? What does he feel about the generous
volunteers who pose for him? Perhaps only another photographer might
care about such information. I'm interested in hearing about his evolution
as an artist and if it were he or someone else who first had the idea to travel
to all fifty states at one time doing the photography over many months.

All of the comments heard spoken by Mr. Tunick are in real time while
he is on the road or after the opening of his exhibition the following year.
It would have been interesting to have him sit in a studio after the exhibition
had run its course and give his impressions about the USA trek and the
reaction to his work on gallery walls. We are never shown that. We are
only mostly shown him on the road where, I'd imagine, there was some
nervousness, doubt, pressure, hesitation, anxiety about the day-to-day
life he was experiencing wanting to create but facing problems along the way.

At the conclusion of this documentary I still don't know if Mr. Tunick
did any of the actual printing for his I-20 gallery exhibition. The film
shows him carrying a smaller print in a tray from a darkroom and then
the unrolling and washing of a much larger exhibition print. But nothing
is indicated about whether he did any of the printing or  was ""hands on""
in anything that appeared later on the walls of the gallery. There is a brief
wordless segment of him dust spotting a large print.

It may sound that I'm negative because of what was omitted from
the film but I thoroughly enjoyed watching another photographer at
work. I've been photographing nudes professionally using
black-and-white film since 1975 so my review carries that bias. It
was a joy to see Mr. Tunick early on talking about the art magazines
while standing near a magazine rack in a store. Then at the very end
he was finally getting their attention.  He achieved something no one
else had with his odyssey across America. For me, there were just
not many ""behind the scenes"" revelations about him and the crew he
needed to assemble to make possible what he accomplished. But I
suspect for more broad appeal such information had to be left out
thinking it might prove boring to a general public.

The documentary allows some of the model participants to talk
about their experience. All have positive things to say about it. And
that will bring me back to the guy in Fargo who did not pose but
whose friend did. Upon the mere mention of photography involving
nudity his mind went to the words ""Asian porn"". What does that reveal
about a culture?

If it is only nude bodies one wishes to see then there are many to see.
in this film. Before purchasing this dvd I read one review on IMDB that
stated this film maybe should be rated NC-17. And that is preposterous.
But it again sadly reflects an attitude people have with simple male and
female nudity.

There is an extra feature about 14 minutes in length that shows a
session in Strawberry Fields in New York City. The printed title at
the beginning states the date as September 8, 2000 but in addressing
the assembled volunteers Spencer states ""Tomorrow is John Lennon's
birthday"" which indicates the month is actually October rather than
September. It's a chilly morning and the participants are shown
arriving, then undressing, and posing in the park and then across the
street. I enjoyed this segment because it encapsulated the quickness of
these public installations.

Viewing this documentary one sees life on the road and a glimpse
of Spencer Tunick on the cusp of his fame. If the film were longer
perhaps a more fully developed portrait of him would emerge. The film
leaves a lot unsaid regarding his thoughts about photography and also
about the contributions of the people who participate in his work. We
never hear him speak about freedom of expression and why he is willing
to be arrested for his beliefs.

Models are all important to any photographer who works with nudes.
I assume that Spencer appreciates and respects all his volunteers (well,
with the possible exception of the nudists at Sandy Hook) but this film
fails to show him expressing a debt of gratitude he owes to them beyond
the obligatory ""Thank you"" at the end of a session. At the Phish concert
he seemed consumed with getting a large number of people. And despite
his doubts and complaints he achieved a large number. It's a cold day in
Central Park with many people participating. Breakfast and a print are
sometimes mentioned as compensation but he is never shown sitting down
speaking to the camera about where he would be without all of these people.
(And as his career has progressed multitudes have been vital). For me, a
more satisfying ending for the film would have been an in-depth interview
following the I-20 gallery exhibition. Allow Mr. Tunick to reflect on the
road tour and tell the viewer how he started in photography. Ask him about
his thoughts concerning freedom of expression and the people who pose for
him. And the technical side of his work - does he develop his film and make
the prints by himself? What are the logistics of making sure each model
receives her/his promised photograph? Perhaps actually show one or two
people receiving the photograph for participating and their reaction. Well,
that would be my film, but this one is good and holds your attention.

Spencer Tunick is to be applauded. As a young man he had a vision
and pursued it. He assembled a crew to assist him plus obtained
a film crew to document him at work.  As he said to his girlfriend
Krissy at one point when she was tiring of the experience amid the
hostility and machismo in South  Dakota, ""this is what I do for a
living, it's my life."" Artists everywhere recognize this statement
and commitment. Mr. Tunick along with Arlene Donnelly have held
a mirror up to American society at the end of the twentieth century.

7950137,3,B00005QBYT,"I had previously seen Spencer Tunick's ""Naked World"" and thought it interesting so I purchased this film. It was much more commercial and focused on promoting sales of Tunick's work, rather than on the process of developing a cohesive story. This is not a terribly provocative film and skims over a lot of the photo shoots. As far as titillating nudity goes...nope, not so much! This was just generally unsatisfying on every level. You neither gain insight into the photographer's process nor reap entertainment from the premise of average folks posing nude. Just...blah!",1298419200,,571,5.150537634408602
7950138,5,B00005QBYT,"This is one of the most intriguing and fun documentaries I've seen in a while. This guy's art is amazing. Plain and simple. The documentary itself is also entertaining because it exposes (no pun intended) the viewer to nudist culture, and celebrates freedom of expression, appreciation of the human form, and most importantly, appreciation of yourself, flaws and all. The whole film has a free-spirited, positive feel that's almost contagious.
  Tunick's photos present the body in a way that is truly beautiful, and not vulgar or cheap in the slightest. I do feel that the guy can be a bit full of himself at times, and this comes through in some scenes. I also don't like his adamant refusal to publish his photos in book form. He gives a pretentious ""art for art's sake"" reason for this, but I think that's just silly pride. If these photos were published in a book, it would absolutely sell.
You may find the artist a bit annoying at times, but his work is great, and this film is definitely worth seeing.",1273190400,,1009,4.662921348314606
