4342848,1,B004EPZ02A,"""Paranormal Activity 3' is the funniest movie you will see in theaters all year. From start to finish it is loaded with gut busting laughs that you will be eager to tell you friends about. The problem? It's not a comedy...at all. In fact it is deadly seriously from beginning to end which only added to the fun. Once in a full moon horror audiences get to experience this sort of bad filmmaking. A film that plummets below mediocre into so-bad-it's-good territory. This is just that film.

""Paranormal Activity 3' begins in 2005, Katie delivers a box of old videotapes to her pregnant sister, Kristi, and Kristi's husband, Daniel. A year later, Kristi and Daniel's house is seemingly burgled and the tapes are missing. Flashback to 1988, a young Katie and Kristi live with their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis; Kristi begins interacting with an invisible friend named Toby. Dennis notices that since Kristi's friend appeared, strange things have been happening in the house. Dennis and Julie try to make a sex tape, but are interrupted by an earthquake. While they look for the girls, the camera shows dust fall from the ceiling and land onto an invisible figure in the room. The figure then moves and the dust falls to the floor.
While reviewing the footage later, Dennis notices the strange incident. He invites his friend Randy over to view the footage, who suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house to capture any other incidents.

That night in the girls' bedroom, Kristi wakes up and begins talking to someone off-camera before going back to bed. When Dennis questions her about this the following day, Kristi tells him that it is Toby. After more disturbed nights and strange occurrences, Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet. He finds the same symbol on a picture of women in a book about demonology. Dennis explains to Julie that the symbol belonged to a witches' coven that brainwashed girls of child-bearing age into having sons and then forgetting about it, but Julie dismisses his claim. Because, of course, he HAS to be making this all up. Right?

Hmmm...where to start with the problems of this film:

* Sometimes there is a time stamp on the camera, sometimes there isn't.
* Who is editing the jump cuts when there is no ""flash forward"" in time?
* Who was changing the tapes in the middle of the night?
* Why is the camera looking over at the parents bed when it is staring straight at the mirror?
* Why didn't the babysitter say what had happened to her to the parents?
* Why didn't the Randy show them his cut after he was attacked by ""Toby""?
* Why was Toby never mentioned in the first two installments?
* Why didn't Dennis show Julie the tapes before going into the stupid speech about the witches?
* Was the final scene (witches in black robes?) really meant to be taken seriously?
* Didn't the video quality appear to be awfully good (and in HD even!!) for something that had been 25 years old and sitting in storage?
* Also did the witches edit the tapes together themselves?

The list goes on and on and on. This is quite the movie experience that really must be seen to be believed. Go in with a few beers and zero thoughts in your head and maybe you'll have a good time. Who knows? Just don't spend money on it...",1320451200,5,3281,4.620926243567753
4342849,3,B004EPZ02A,"Much like before, the family in question sets up a video recording system to monitor house activities.  This time it's 6-hour cycles of VHS.  Old school baby, tracking problems and all.  Speaking of problems, the third installment of this franchise - one I have enjoyed somewhat - goes significantly off-track in this prequel revisal.  In previous (read: future) films the spirit (Toby) is unmistakably evil, but in this version the paranormal has a range of emotions...as odd as it sounds.  Friend to foe, playful at times, the consistency is severely lacking.  Compounding this problem is the bizarre twist at the end in which the family history alluded to in the previous two films is sloppily exposed in an abbreviated final act.

What this film does deliver is historical perspective and solid acting.  The viewer finds out why the family's lineage has been haunted, as well as the source of the haunting.  But, as mentioned, it just isn't cohesive enough to truly enjoy.  A seasoned viewer is likely to watch this third installment and crack jokes through most of the scenes because we know just about when attention is required.  While fresh the first time I saw this style of horror, the novelty has worn off.  Additionally, how am I supposed to resolve the conundrum of a truly scary demon from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B002VKE1K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>&nbsp;is named Toby?!

Decent, but not as good as the previous versions, wait for DVD.",1320364800,4,1549,5.457983193277311
4342850,3,B004EPZ02A,"This is a prequel to the Paranormal Activity film, and this one shows how the haunting of Katie and her sister began. Once again, this one is full of tension, and the filmmakers have been able to maintain a level of quality through three films in the trilogy. The first was quite groundbreaking and hasn't been matched, but the second one was also quite good, the third to a lesser extent. There are some cheap scares in this one, but they provide a bit of levity at times. This should be the last of the trilogy, and is worth seeing.",1319932800,3,534,4.35
4342851,5,B004EPZ02A,"I saw this one on the release date at the theaters. I really loved Paranormal Activity 3. The story line pieced the other two movies lines all together. You can actually start watching this movie first before watching the other 2 movies and it does make sense. The 3rd movie is where it all started. Then, the 2nd movie is the middle story. But, the very end of the 2nd movie, shows you what happens after the 1st movie. Then, the 1st movie is actually follows the 2nd movie. Confused? Well, I wasn't because I pieced it all together in my mind. And, if you like to do that too, then you would love these movies.

The 3rd movie does give you a small preview of what has happened in the other movies and starts working its way backwards in time. Then, it starts showing you how it all started. I thought they didn't really need this part and they should have just started the movie from how it all started. But, it doesn't take anything away, so I let it slide.

Usually, when I watch prequel movies, they are done pretty badly and the story line usually doesn't fit in so well. But, in this movie, I loved how it all make sense. Now, what did I see.

Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!

I like finding out why and how it all started with Katie and Kristi. In this movie, you find out that Kristi, the younger sister has a friend name Toby. Toby turns out to be the demon that is hunting the house. Later on we find out more about Toby origins and why he is there.

It looks to me like there are a bunch of women that are in this cult. This cult practices summoning demons. (I'm just not sure why they do that. But, once the demons are summoned they will seek to marry girls in their family. The demons will try to do everything to convince the girls to marry them. Meaning they will scary and terrify them until they finally agree. Then, she will have to give up the first born male child to the demon. (This was a connection to PA2.)

At the very end of the movie, the grand mother is who started it all, and she is the one that summoned Toby. Toby is now following the grand daughter, Kristi and trying to marry her. (Now, you have the whole back story. and can start watching PA 2. Then, when you finish watching PA 2, you will understand PA 1 better.)

I really like how in this movie, they stop doing the whole human procession bit. Toby can really show off his real power and great performance. My favorite part of the movie was when Katie is chasing Kristi and she then runs into what seems like a wall. The wall of course is Toby. Then, Toby is invisible and you can't see what he is doing, but you know that he is there. You feel like something is going to happen and it does! I won't spoil it for you and won't tell you what happens. I was pretty surprised to that.

This movie made a change to what I saw in the commercial. In the commercial, you see the two little girls play bloody marry and at the end of the scene, you see a dark female figure. Well, in the movie, they took that part out and replaced it with something way better! They still play bloody marry, but it has been changed for the better. I won't spoil that part for you and you should just watch it.

I find myself laughing sometimes in this movie, and it's not because the movie is a comedy. I started to laugh because I have a good assumption to what's going to see. But, during that time before it actually happens, I started to laugh. For example, at the end of the movie, you see little Katie turn around by the staircase. The guy calls Katie and she doesn't respond. He slowly starts moving towards Katie and still calling her. She still doesn't make any reaction or movement. I start laughing. I know something bad/scary about to happen. I'm thinking, don't do it. Don't do it! Don't go to her!!! But, I'm seeing it and its happening. Then, the bad does happen. This of course, isn't really meant to be joke. I'm laughing out knowing something bad is going to happen to the character, because, I, myself, don't want to see him/her do the action.

I say watch this movie, if you liked the first 2. It gives you some insight to why and how it all started. If you haven't watched any of these movies. You in luck. You can see this one first. This movie, is better because it slightly different from the first 2 and has a bit of a faster peace to it.",1319846400,5,4318,4.216707021791768
4342852,3,B004EPZ02A,"I recently saw PA3 and was not as creeped out as the first one. I know a lot of people loved this movie, I unfortunatly was not one of them. I liked the originality of the original and now I know what to expect. The scares are just not there. It was a decent attempt and it wasn't that the director was lacking anything. Its just that I already seen it before. I get tired of a original idea for a film doing really well then there's numerous more made. I seen it before now try doing something else original to scare us. If you trully loved the original you will like this third instillation. This is supposed to be the origins movie, to explain how Paranormal Activity began. I don't want to ruin it for anyone but this movie reminded me and my family as another Blair Witch project. Watch the movie and wait till the end to understand what I mean. I would trully wait for this movie to come out on DVD and wouldn't waste your money at the theaters. If your like me and are tired of all the SAWS and Final Destinations that just keep being made. This will probably be no different from those franchises. How much originality can you come up with when you hit part 9. In a few years you'll see Paranormal Activity In Space or something like that. It's done now give us something else to enjoy. The only thing that seems to be dead in Hollywood is originality. Hey there's an idea Paranormal Activity 6 The Ghost of Original Movies.",1319500800,2,1432,4.287822878228782
4342853,5,B004EPZ02A,"""Paranormal Activity 3"" is great! This is how the story goes: The PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise continues with this third outing from Paramount Pictures. Oren Peli and Jason Blum return to produce the highly secretive feature.

The cast led by Lauren Bitter (as Julie) & Christopher Smith (as Dennis) is great. The directing by Henry Joost & Ariel Schulman is great. The story & screenplay (based on Oren Peli's characters) by Christopher B. Landon is great. The cinematography by Magdalena Gorka Bonacorso is great. The film editing by Gregory Plotkin is great. The casting by Terri Taylor is great. The production design by Jennifer Spence is great. The art direction by David Batchelor Wilson is great. The set decoration by Kelly Berry is great. The costume design by Leah Butler is great.

This is a great follow-up to the first two ""Paranormal Activity"" movies, which are great and entertaining. This will keep you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing at the same time. This is a little bit better than the second ""Paranormal Activity"". This is one of the best horror movies of the year. This is another great movie from the makers who also brought you ""Insidious"" and the first two ""Paranormal Activity"" movies.",1319241600,,1252,4.900943396226415
4342854,4,B004EPZ02A,"First off, I should say that I LOVED parts one and two.  The first two relied more heavily on very slow-building tension.  These predecessors basically ""taught"" viewers how to watch these movies in the first 20-30 minutes by offering numerous subtle, relatively unimportant objects moving as if a spectral breeze had shifted them.  This way when such production devices became important, the viewer had a trained eye--not unlike what was done with White Noise.  These movies convey a style that is very unusual.  So it came as no surprise to me that there was little middle ground in people's opinions of them; they loved'em or hated'em.  I love'em.  Why?  Because my senses are all on full power; I'm all in; I'm practically concentrating on the screen and listening to every creak trying to sleuth out the next clue that something fishy is going on in that house.  Some people may call this ""work"".  I call it cool.  [But people chatting during the movie are a much greater distraction than normal under the circumstances.]

 This third installment was my least favorite, but I can totally understand why it may be others' favorite.  While it still employed subtle moving objects, it did it less, instead relying on more mainstream devices to provoke scared jumps from the audience.  It also borrowed more heavily from the Poltergeist movies than the first two--not that I minded.  The characters' investigation into the strange goings-on was more methodical and plot-driven.  The first two were more event-driven and investigated more out of fear and curiosity.  The differences between 3 and 1 & 2 were subtle, but numerous, chief amongst them being that ""the paranormal"" functions as a character in this movie, rather than a mysterious ""force"" in the first two.  As such, the actions of ""the paranormal"" were more blatant and felt more like ""it"" was doing something ""to someone"" whereas in 1 & 2 it was more like ""something was happening"" to someone in a haunted house.

 The plot is simple.  A family lives in a house.  Weird things start happening.  Step-dad starts putting cameras around the house.  Things get weirder.  And from there anything more would give too much away.  But while the first two movies' endings left us largely to wild speculation, I will say that this one ends with something of an explanation of the paranormal activity.

 It doesn't really matter in which order you watch these movies.  However, each sequel (or in this case prequel) was designed to mold over the events of the previous installment.  So watch them in order if it's convenient.  I also demand you watch these with the lights off.  It makes it easier to avoid distractions while you're concentrating on the screen.",1319241600,53,2712,4.903083700440528

The acting was very good, all around... But something about the way they filmed it this time (the camera hitched to a fan, moving slowly between two rooms... insanity inducing suspense, there) was too much for this 40 year old to bear ... er... even during a day time viewing!  I found myself unable to withstand the slow build-up of those scenes... when you just KNOW some scary sh*t will be in the next rotation to the other room.  I had my hand up over my face, I was so scared. I can't quite put my finger on why I actually enjoyed the other two more than I ""enjoyed"" this one.

4343477,4,B004EPZ02A,"this one is a big improvement in the scare department from the second one, and they fixed some of the issues I had with the second one. The first improvement is the static cameras. The second one had very wide camera angles that did not really cause any suspense. the example being the outdoor pool. this one goes back to the tighter close quarter shots focusing attention on a few specific things. example the girls narrow loft bedroom. The scares were much more elaborate in this one as well. without spoiling two films PA 2 had mostly pots and pans falling, doors opening and closing, that sort of stuff. PA 3 seems to skip the slow build up of activity and focus more on larger more obvious stuff like a bed being thrown. I got it everyone has a different opinion on what movie is the best. For me the one with the most scares is number 3 but I still like the first one better. number two I really didn't like. the things I don't care for are the story. I didn't watch any of these films expecting or even caring if it had a great story line, if I wanted a horror with a story line I would watch Candy man, not a low budget found footage film that's at like 5 movies in the series.

4343479,2,B004EPZ02A,"You may or may not remember 2007's ""Paranormal Activity"" or 2010's ""Paranormal Activity 2,"" depending on how interested you were in fake reality shows about ghosts and demons or how patient you were getting through them.  In 2011's ""Paranormal Activity 3,"" we get more of the same.

The premise of the movies involves a Southern California family being haunted by a demon or demons, and they do everything they can think of to find it or at least film it, using handheld video cameras and surveillance cams all over the house.  What we found in the last installment was a lot of empty time as we waited for something to happen on the surveillance tape, and then got a few startling moments as doors banged shut.  Episode two ended with all hell breaking loose in the final few minutes in a most unconvincing manner.  The movie wasn't awful, just tedious:  a long wait for a dubious wrap-up.

When you think about it, these kinds of films are gold mines for studios.  Like television reality shows, they don't require much in the way of scripts, sets, costumes, special effects, direction, or acting.  Indeed, the more amateurish they look, the better they work as slices of so-called ""real"" life.  So they cost relatively little to make and promise huge returns at the box office if they can be scary enough.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" seems to have been the progenitor of these things, so you know who to blame and the kind of thing you're in for if you didn't already see the first two ""Paranormal Activity"" films.

Anyway, we take up in ""Paranormal Activity 3"" two decades before the first movie began, a prequel that occurs in 1988.  We meet the two sisters, Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown), as children, before they grew up, got married, and experienced the paranormal mischief of movies one and two.  The newest movie sort of explains why demons have been following them around since childhood.  It doesn't explain it very well, mind you, but at least it gives you an idea.

Katie and Kristi are living with their mother Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) in the suburban community of Carlsbad, California, during the several weeks of the story.  Dennis is a wedding videographer, so he has an array of VHS video cameras at his disposal.  When he begins to observe odd happenings in the house--noises and such--he sets up an array of cameras around the place and takes to carrying a video camera with him wherever he goes.  The result of all this video handiwork is what we see in the film.  It's a sort of documentary with a wink and a nod; a documentary that wants us to believe in its reality when we know full well it's just a fiction.

The movie's formula is the same as before:  The family members hear noises, weird stuff starts occurring, things go bump in the night; the camera captures it all, while the audience waits around for something, anything, to please hurry up and happen.  Needless to say, much of the camera work is shaky and the edits jerky to simulate a home movie.

As usual, the film depends more on startling us than in genuinely frightening us.  Still, that's enough for a lot of viewers who apparently can't tell the difference.  There are a couple of scenes where people in the film actually jump out of nowhere and yell ""Boo!""  Yeah, both scenes are startling, but are they scary?  Hardly.  There are almost no points in the film where the filmmakers even attempt anything like creating tension or suspense.  When they do attempt it, the scenes turn out pretty well, like one involving a baby-sitter (Johanna Braddy) and another involving a ""Bloody Mary"" game.  They are truly creepy, and if the writers could have come up with more such creepiness, it would have improved the movie considerably.  Unfortunately, they don't and rely on shock tactics instead.

Also as usual in horror movies, at least one person refuses to believe any of it, in this case the mother, who won't even look at Dennis's video footage of possible paranormal activity in the house.  When young Kristi starts seeing and talking to an invisible, malevolent entity she calls Toby, the mother dismisses it as childish imagination.

So on we wait for something to happen, with doors opening by themselves, slamming shut, and objects flying around various rooms being the major activities of the first hour.  How many times in these movies can the filmmakers repeat the same things before audiences throw up their hands and cry Surrender?  Apparently, not enough times if box-office receipts are any indication.

Basically, the film does little for the first eighty minutes or so and then picks up in the final fifteen.  However, just as the previous film went off the deep end into mindless Neverland material in its climax, so does ""Paranormal Activity 3"" jump the shark or nuke the refrigerator in the end.  The conclusion is so over-the-top and comes so out of the blue, it pretty much ruins what little believability the movie generated in the beginning.  Thus, you take your pick:  a slow, boring start with a few promising moments in the middle or a faster-paced but totally ridiculous conclusion.

To add insult to injury, there are scenes in the trailers (see above) that never appear in the final movie.  So much for truth in advertising.

One aside about this whole ""paranormal activity"" business:  While I know these movies are just movies, after all, and one should not take them too seriously, the filmmakers do try to pass them off as something approaching reality, as though they were documentaries.  So I feel it a minor obligation to point out that actual parapsychologists don't deal much in theories of demons from hell.  If objects fly around a room seemingly on their own--a poltergeist experience--parapsychologists believe the objects move because human agents either physically or psychically move them.  That is, live people, not ghosts or demons, almost always instigate poltergeist activity.  As a friend of mine, Loyd Auerbach, a noted author, investigator, and researcher of things paranormal, remarked a few years ago in his preface to Movie Met's Blu-ray review of ""Poltergeist"":  ""If that was the reality of what we investigate and encounter, I certainly would not have stayed in this field for as long as I have.  I'm brave, but I'm not stupid!""

Video:
Since the filmmakers want us to believe that one of the movie's characters shot the video we're watching, they made the image quality look intentionally dull and soft, something like VHS tape footage of the Eighties, despite Paramount's having transferred it to Blu-ray in high definition on a dual-layer BD50, using an MPEG-4/AVC codec.  The thing is, while the picture quality doesn't look much better than most standard-definition DVD's, it is probably a lot better than anything we'd see on a VHS tape of the era.  Go figure.  I'd say the movie likes it both ways.

Audio:
OK, so the filmmakers want us to believe that what we're seeing is what the VHS cameras caught in 1988, right?  How, then, to explain the film's surround sound, reproduced here in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1?  Did the character shooting all the footage have multiple microphones set up in every room?  Sure, it's only a movie, as I've said, so we shouldn't sweat the details.  In any case, the sound is mostly quiet, really quiet because nothing is happing most of the time, and when something does happen, it's usually loud.  The soundtrack works fine in this regard, with a deep, rumbling bass during an earthquake scene; good, quick transient response; wide dynamics; and strong impact.  In fact, the sound does most of the work of the scares.

Extras:
This two-disc Combo Pack contains the feature film in two HD versions on disc one, a Blu-ray:  the regular R-rated theatrical version (83 minutes) and an unrated extended version (94 minutes).  In addition, the Blu-ray provides three minutes of ""Lost Tapes,"" additional footage; fourteen scene selections for the unrated version; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages;
English audio descriptions; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

The second disc, a DVD, contains the unrated edition of the movie in standard def; access to a digital copy of the unrated version; and access to an UltraViolet edition for instant streaming.  The two discs come housed in a flimsy double Eco-case with cutouts front and rear, I assume for ghosts or demons to enter and exit more easily.

Parting Shots:
""Paranormal Activity 3"" is much the same as its predecessors, although more the worse for wear; that is, we've been there and done that already.  One would think it was time to move on, but I suppose as long as the films make money (and how could they not make money, given their modest budget and prodigious returns?  This one grossed over $200,000,000 worldwide on a budget of about $5,000,000), who can blame the studio.  If you liked the first two ""Paranormal Activity"" movies, you'll probably like this one as well.  For me, it was a matter of diminishing returns on a product that wasn't very good to begin with.",1434412800,,9187,4.861736334405145

Two years ago, I saw the trailer to 'The Marked Ones' and I was very intrigued, so I eventually bought the whole series to get an idea for what I was in for. Last night, I finally watched P.A. 3 and it was actually not too bad. It definitely had some creepy moments. The rotating camera was a nice touch. It really added suspense. I was hoping for a few more 1980's references but there was a Teddy Ruxpin doll, that's 80's enough, right?

In 2005, Kristi is pregnant and Katie is helping her out by taking a box of some old videos of them and making room for the baby. In 1988, we see a young Katie and Kristi living their lives with their mom and her boyfriend, Dennis, who makes his living by taping Weddings and other occasions. One night, Dennis wants to film himself and Julie during a sex tape, but it's interrupted by an earthquake. Dennis watches the video back and sees some dust landing on an entity inside the house, so he puts cameras everywhere trying to figure out what it is. Kristi begins talking to an 'imaginary' friend named Toby. Every night, things keep getting worse.

It is in this film that we discover how the activity began with a young Katie and a young Kristi. When the first film was released I was all about it because it had been a while since the found footage thing had been done theatrically. When it was a success I knew a sequel would follow and when that did well I knew a third was coming. Seeing how the first two played out story wise I kinda had a feeling a prequel was on the way. I wasn't sure if it would be the next film or not but I knew it was on the way. So when the third was actually released as such I was interested in seeing it.

Julie, her two daughters, and her boyfriend Dennis are your typical family in the late eighties. Julie loves Dennis and loves that her girls love Dennis as well. Dennis is a videographer doing mostly weddings but he starts to put his cameras around the house when things start to get a little weird. Strange noises and objects moving plus the youngest daughter Kristi is talking to an imaginary friend, Toby. That is normal for a young child but as things progress Dennis believes that Toby may be anything but imaginary.

I am not sure how I would rank this film amongst the others, its hard to decide since they all seem the same to me. I do find these films entertaining but none have really scared me. With that said this one falls right in nicely with the others except maybe for the ending which was the only new thing that surprised me a little. This film went on to be the highest grossing PA film in the franchise, I still think it is at this point.

4343990,2,B004EPZ02A,"Paranormal Activity 3 (Henry Joost and Ariel Schulamn, 2011)

I was a big, big fan of the first two Paranormal Activity movies. The first one dropped like a bomb from out of nowhereit was one of the first found-footage films since The Blair Witch Project that actually looked like a found footage movie (probably because of Oren Peli's lack of budget). The second was slicker, but it went places, emotionally, that the first hadn't dared to go, and it succeeded in doing something that no movie has done to me since Candyman twenty years previousit scared the pants off me in a crowded theater. So of course I had high hopes for the third installment in the franchise, and the first trailer that came out seemed pretty nifty. How much did I like Joost and Schulman (Catfish)'s first entry in the series? I'll put it this way: I've had Paranormal Activity 4 on my Netflix Instant queue since the day it appeared there...but I haven't watched it yet.

NOTE: the plot synopsis necessarily contains spoilers for the first film in the series. Proceed with caution if necessary.

Set in 1988, Paranormal Activity 3 purports to tell the story of how poor Katie (Up All Night's Chloe Csengery) and her little sister Kristi (Wiener Dog Nationals' Jessica Tyler Brown)  first met up with the demon that has haunted Katie throughout the series. The movie focuses more on Katie and Kristi's mother, Julie (Bride Wars' Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Little Children's Christopher Nicholas Smith), as well as Dennis' friend Randy (Sky High's Dustin Ingram), a videographer Dennis brings in to help document the weird things going on in the house when they start getting out of hand. We first learn something is amiss when Kristi started talking to an imaginary friend she has named Toby. While that doesn't seem out of the ordinary at the beginning, Dennis starts to realize that Toby may not be entirely imaginary after an earthquakehe captured a few frames of video that night where the settling dust outlined a human-shaped figure, otherwise invisible. It's at this point he calls Randy in, and the movie begins to look like PA2, with cameras everywhere in the house. It would be a spoiler to say whether or not that mystery is ever revealed in this film (but as I mentioned in the first paragraph, there is a PA4, and a related movie, Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, came and went in January 2014 with almost no fanfare).

The main thing about PA3 that contrasts with the first two entries in the series is how forgettable it is; the setup is basically the same, the execution is the same, the only differences are the actors and directors.  And both come off here as pale imitations of the original. (There is also some debate over whether the final sequence of this film breaks canon. I originally thought soactually, I think the phrase that went through my head as I was watching is this makes no friggin' sense given the first two moviesbut I'm willing to be convinced otherwise by someone with some evidence.) Still, for all that, it's not a terrible movie; it has the weight of the two movies that came before it shoving it down in my estimation. Had it been a standalone Satanic Panic movie, I probably would have liked it more; it's not The House of the Devil, but then few things are. Still, I would have liked to see these directorswho have been noted widely for being so avant-garde in Catfishto do something, anything, here that defied convention. **",1396742400,,3469,4.735099337748345

 Returning: Katie Featherston, Brian Boland, Sprague Grayden, William Juan Prieto & Jackson Xenia Prieto as ""Hunter"".

The movie begins with a new flashback as Dan (Brian Boland) and Kristi (Sprague Grayden) are painting the baby's room. Kristi is pregnant. Kate (Katie Featherston) comes over for a visit. She would like to put a few things into their basement. She has some of grandma's boxes of VHS tapes of the family when Katie and Kristi were children in 1988.
  And so the story of this movie begins.
 It is Kate's (Chloe Csengery) birthday and they have just finished the party.  Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith), is alone in the house, but he hears a noise. He looks through the house and then the girl's upstairs room of Kate & Kristi (Jessica Brown). He thinks it was the Teddy Ruxpin Bear until he hears the unknown noise again. He opens the small door of the closet. Suddenly, he notices Kristi standing behind him.
 Later that night, Dennis and his girlfriend, Julie (Lauren Bittner), decide to make an amateur sex tape in their bedroom. They hear strange noises, but continue their love-making. Suddenly, an earthquake happens.
 The next morning, Dennis looks at the video of the earthquake after they had left the bedroom. In the plaster dust from the ceiling, he sees a figure.
 Kristi gets up in the night to talk to someone. She has an imaginary friend, Toby.  More strange paranormal activity occurs.

Also in the cast: Hallie Foote, Dustin Ingram, Johanna Braddy, Paitoon Cheng, Eddie Medrano.

This is true. I watched this first since this was the prequel. But, the next couple quotes are what really get me.

""Brace yourself for the horror phenomenon that delivers ""heart-exploding scares""* so frightening that ""the last 15 minutes will mess you up for life.""**

*Brad Miska, Bloody Disgusting; **Aint-It-Cool-News

Let me say this: yeah, right. I did not receive ""heart-exploding scares"" and the last 15 minutes most definitely did not mess me up for life. Yes, the last 2 minutes or so were...different; but most definitely not nightmare inducing. In fact, I slept like a baby the night I watched it. I watched this one first, and then the first one second in one day. This was most definitely my favorite, though, and will most definitely watch it again. I believe that this is the least scariest in the franchise. From least scariest to most, I would have to say:

1. Paranormal Activity 3

2. Paranormal Activity

3. Paranormal Activity 4

4. Paranormal Activity 2

I'll explain why in my other reviews for the other movies in this series. Though I personally believe this is the least scariest out of all of them, you should most definitely watch it and state your own opinion.",1369785600,,1431,4.761133603238866

This one actually makes the first seem better? So I'm assuming you've already seen the first 2 so you are well prepared for what you get. A bunch of household cameras filming a lot of nothing. This time it was the woman's turn to doubt the hauntings. Completely ridiculous! Especially with the videotaped evidence that was caught in this one?

Also, didn't expect that ending which was nice but they still could have done a better one. Clearly I have mixed feelings but if you've seen the first two movies, I think you should go ahead and watch this because it lets you know how it all started and if you haven't seen it then I think you could still get some entertainment out of it because you don't know how it ends making this some scary movie where some demon is just attacking these girls.",1365292800,,832,4.238993710691824

4345186,3,B004EPZ02A,"Paranormal Activity started the phenomenon of films that are shot on camcorder. At the time, it was considered to be revolutionary, but at this point it's getting a little old. How many of these camcorder films have actually been successful? ...and don't you get just the slightest bit nauseated by the constant movement of the camera? I guess that's for you to decide, back to the film. In the third installment of Paranormal Activity, we learn what happened to Katie and her sister when they were little. To be honest with you, I was pretty into this film until the last twenty minutes or so. Without spoiling it for ya, lets just say the story takes a dramatic turn away from the storyline. The result of this is that the overall story isn't as creepy and really doesn't make as much sense as it should. Paranormal Activity was never that scary to begin with, the film plays on the audience by having things suddenly jump out at them, but the story itself has gotten far less creepier as the series has gone on. Part 3 and 4 do have different writer/directors and that may be part of the problem. The first one freaked me out, the second one was a little slow, but also did the trick, and this one really didn't scare me. They relied much more on making the audience jump than they did on scaring them with the actual story. Number three didn't stick with me for days afterward, the way one and two did. As for the cast, they were all newcomers and the little girls were absolutely terrific! This series has a way of finding newcomers who seem like they've been acting for decades. Paranormal Activity 3 is good for a few cheap jumps and laughs, but the ending was really disappointing, leading me to think less of this film than I do of the other two.",1361491200,,1755,4.453416149068323

Now, tapes of their childhood have been discovered that reveal their first encounter with the evil entity. Like the first two films, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 is a long and drawn out waiting game that has very little story to tell in between its shocks and surprises. The characters are none more convincing or likable, and even the little girls are painted as minor annoyances. With enough patience, however, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 provides some of the most frightening moments the series has to offer. It is always more unnerving when children become involved in the supernatural, and CATFISH directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman play this up for all it is worth. Writer Christopher Landon also adds an interesting new element to the background of the haunting that ensures the series' perpetuity. Other than that, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 varies little from the proven path, so fans of the series will find plenty to love. Others will just be outright bored.

Yet, somehow I still feel ripped off! I did invest an hour and a half of my life in watching it, and I want my time back. Watching a C-Span session of congress will provide much more terror than this poor excuse for a movie. It is another haunted house movie, with nothing new, nothing original, nothing interesting and nothing the least bit frightening.

4345348,5,B004EPZ02A,"This 3rd installment of Paranormal Activity is great.  It gradually started to frighten me - and did it without cheap gore.  It was filled with real dread and the end was unexpected and stunning but I do not want to give anything away to spoil your enjoyment.

Picture this - I was watching it alone in the living room with just a candle burning.  My husband and dogs were asleep in the bedroom.  Because that made my room look black and white, the grainy black and white of the film seemed to INCLUDE where I was sitting.  There is a subtle scene in the bedroom doorway and another with the babysitter that are unforgettable.  Some might say silly, but not when you are alone and are a person who likes spooky movies.

It made the first 2 movies understandable.  Make certain you look at every frame of this movie - there are things lurking in the background that you might not notice.
For that reason, I think the grainy quality of the film works very well - because you can't see exactly and clearly which heightened the fear.

Bravo that is can be so evil and scary without disgusting torture and gross scenes.  You don't have to have movie stars and famous directors to make an excellent horror movie - you need good writing and actors who look scared and 'into' the dread instead of just 'going through the motions'.",1353628800,,1322,4.466666666666667

4345353,4,B004EPZ02A,"""Paranormal Activity 3"" uses the same conceit of the two earlier installments but is actually a prequel, establishing the creepy background for Katie (Katie Featherson) and her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden). Through the power of found tapes, the film takes us back before the first two installments to flesh out what the ""Paranormal Activity"" series established - the girls were not random victims of a haunting.

Oren Peli's ghost series is known for having certain elements that few other films can replicate: threatening children; subtle but creepy special effects, and using everyday footage to tell a ghost story.  All those elements are in full force in ""Paranormal Activity 3."" The two girls serve as perpetual foils for Kristi's imaginary friend, Toby.  Toby, it seems, is not as imaginary as the girls' mother Julie (Lauren Bittner, adding some skin to the franchise) might hope.  Hapless boyfriend and wedding videographer Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) is particularly interested in what goes on at their house when a specter appears on a homemade film. Dennis' curiosity piqued, he recruits techie friend Randy (Dustin Ingram) to get to the bottom of what's going on by setting up cameras around the house, including one mounted on an oscillating fan.

What ensues is a series of freak-outs that range from noises in a closet to something as mundane as a kid wearing a sheet.  The scariest moments involve outsiders like Randy and babysitter Lisa (Johanna Brady). Their reactions add some spice to an otherwise faithful retread of the original film, with Dennis taking the role of the hapless investigator and Julie the unbelieving skeptic. But it's really the girls that make the film so unsettling by talking to the invisible Toby, walking around the house at night, and standing still for hours at a time.

""Paranormal Activity 3"" makes clever use of sound, or lack thereof, so that you will be leaning into the screen when the scares arrive.  This installment does resort to more ""jump"" scares than the previous two, but that's forgivable given that there are many genuinely frightening moments.  The oscillating camera trick manages to create more dread in a single scene than some horror movie franchises.

If ""Paranormal Activity 3"" has a weakness it's the ending, less ghost story and more ""Rosemary's Baby.""  Given that the franchise has gotten far more mileage out of the traditional ghost story since ""Poltergeist,"" it was probably inevitable.",1351900800,,2473,5.14214463840399

So after the first one showed what happened to an adult Katie, then the second showed what happened to her sister Kristi and also Katie after the first movie. This third installment takes place in 1988, where Katie and Kristi are 8 and 5 respectively and after moving into a new home begin to experience strange happenings. Kristi in particular as she talks to a being named ""Toby"" who seems to want her to do things that she doesn't mind doing at first but then later when he gets more violent towards Katie, their mom and their new father.

The father does wedding videos and also sets cameras up around the house to capture any of this activity, he records these on VHS tapes and the more he sees on film the more he tries to discover what this being may be and what they want. The scares are a bit more conventional than the previous two, however I do admit this was pretty scary in parts, mainly cause the being ""Toby"" seems far more real of a threat quicker than in the other flicks.

This was not the ""Unseen force takes its time to make its presence known"" flick, well at least not as much this time around, I admit its not as good as the previous ones but there's plenty of good scares and the closing minutes are very chilling.

4345447,3,B004EPZ02A,"I'm reviewing the regular 1hr 24min, which I viewed through Netflix Streaming (available as of 10/21/12). The movie is a prequel to the original Paranormal Activity and follows Katie, Kristi and their parents back in 1988.

This film is basically the same as the first 2 since it follows the same formula: weird things happen, father/husband sets up camera(s), sleeping and more strange things happen, and a frantic ending occurs. If you're not tired of this structure yet, then this may not bother you at all but, it's also a bit predictable. The scares were decent, I felt like this one used more jump-out scares, though. I did enjoy the Bloody Mary sequence with Randy and Katie, though; especially when the furniture is thrown and only Toby's chair is in it's place. One problem with these films and this may only be me, but sometimes during the long shots of them sleeping or doing everyday activities, my eyes are always wandering as I tried to figure out what I'm supposed to be looking at. I'm a fan of supernatural horror, so I found the film to be entertaining, nonetheless, but it's really nothing special.

Paranormal Activity 3 is more of the same. If you're not a fan of the series or found footage films in general, then you're probably better off avoiding this. I heard the extended version is a lot better, so I look forward to watching that when I get the chance.

4345449,2,B004EPZ02A,"This installment gets an A+ for cleverness but a C for scares.

What made PA2 so good was that although it was a Hollywood cash-grab sequel, it carefully built on the minimalist scares of the original, while building the mythology. I actually like the sequel more than the original.

Part 3 is just as clever in its construction as Part 2, and I'm grateful to the filmmakers for giving us what we **remember** VHS looking like, not what it **actually** looks like!

But the problem with PA 3 is that it's more ""hollywood"" than #2 was, making the unknown horror of the first two films into something closer to a ""franchise monster"" like Freddy Kreuger or Chucky. We now know roughly the size and shape of ""IT"", we know what ""IT"" sounds like,  ""IT"" now has a name and, as we see, an origin of sorts.

#3 also suffers from Hollywood sequel-itis. For example, if pots and pans falling on a kitchen floor was scary, then the entire contents of a kitchen falling is scarier, right? Right? Nope.

Another Hollywoodism: Anything for a scare. Even if it doesn't fit, or make sense with what we already know.

And then there's the standard ""They definitely know they're in danger but stay anyway,"" which worked under the circumstances of Part One but makes no sense here, especially with the kids in danger. If you sat and watched videos of your kid being pushed around by an invisible monster, you probably wouldn't have her sleep in the same room that night. Probably...

So, ultimately, I guess I'm glad I know the whole story (or as much as I need to know). But if you're on the fence as I was, fearing a letdown after the first two, my advice is quite while you're ahead and don't see it.",1350518400,,1683,4.495081967213115

I would say there are probably 5-6 added scenes that really do contribute to the story and make the film a little clearer. I was initially a little apprehensive to put money down for the Extended version because typically that doesn't mean much, but I would definitely recommend this to any lover of the films.

4345587,3,B004EPZ02A,"There appears to be either a love or hate reaction to the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films.  They're very low-key, minimalist supernatural stories that manage to use their limitations to bring about some effective chills.

I've watched hours after hours of full-blown, stomach-churning gorefests that couldn't pull off one of the genuine eerie chills I got from watching the security cameras in the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films.

They're creating a reality where something sinister is growing off-camera, in our closets, down the hall--places we know very well.  A light turning on and off on the other side of the house fills us with dread since we know no one is there.  And, for the third time, I was pulled into this experience.

The problem I had this time was that it wasn't entirely clear just what was down the hall.  Although that was intentional for the purposes of the story (it is resolved, at least partially, by the end), I didn't get the same feeling of knowing that a demon was loose in these people's lives.  The trailer showed the little girls summoning a ghost via the ""Bloody Mary"" campfire tale of repeating her name in a dark room three times.  This scene doesn't appear in the film.  What does appear in the film is one of the little girls chanting it with an adult--but since there's clearly something already in the house, it doesn't really fit.

But there are still some very cool scenes, especially involving a rotating camera that slowly scans back and forth.  My favorite involved the babysitter.

There will be a 4th entry and the trailer was recently released picking up the story with Katie and Hunter now haunting a pretty young neighbor.  We're back in the present for the next one and I'm sure I'll see it, interested to see where they go with this.

I'd like to see one where someone reacts to all of this paranormal activity going on in all of these home movies!",1344556800,,1889,4.699088145896656

Second, who would videotape themselves watching a videotape? Strange behavior. Next, why would the ghost or the people allow recording. Finally, videotape was not widescreen and had poor low-light capability (this movie is dim but we can see what's going on).

The kitchen scene is the only interesting scene in the entire movie.

The best movie of this genre is still Blair Witch Project. Everything about that movie was somewhat believable.

4345652,4,B004EPZ02A,"It must be said that the ""found footage"" sub-genre of horror movies requires the audience to suspend disbelief a bit.  The idea is clever - you're watching something that allegedly really happened, which gives the movie a bit of documentary-style credibility.  But you have to accept that at some point in the movie, you're going to shout, ""put down the darn camera!""  It's surprising that the ""Scream"" franchise hasn't mocked this trope yet.

Either you can get past this, or you can't.  If you can, the ""Paranormal Activity"" series should be on your must-see list.  The first two movies tell the present-day stories of Kristi and Katie, two sisters whose pleasantly suburban lifestyles are ripped asunder by a sinister spectral force.  In ""Paranormal Activity 3,"" we return to 1988, where the sisters first meet the poltergeist who will terrify them and their families a few years down the road.

The movie sets the stage by showing grown-up Kristy and Katie rediscovering old videotapes from when they were children - a gift from recently departed Grandma.  These tapes are later stolen in a scene all too familiar with fans of the first two films.  The movie then switches to the videotapes.

Young Katie and Kristi are enjoying Katie's birthday party, and we also meet their mom Julie and her boyfriend Dennis.  (Oddly, there's never any mention of the girls' biological father - where did he go . . . hmmm.)  Dennis, conveniently for the movie's conceit, is a videographer, so naturally his response to every development is his life is to tape it.  During the birthday video, we learn that Kristi has a close relationship with an imaginary friend, Toby.

Toby, as you might guess, turns out to be more than imaginary, and he quickly proves to be one scary, demanding guy.  To avoid spoilers, that's it for the plot summary.

Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman know how to make a found-footage movie.  Tension builds nicely as we strain to watch a seemingly innocuous scene - are the bedsheets moving?  How about the lamp?  Perhaps the creepiest scenes (before the final 15 minutes, which are terrifying) come with their use of a video camera set up on an oscillating fan base so the camera slowly pans from one part of the house to another - the directors' clever use of the ""that freaking thing wasn't there a few seconds ago"" trick will have you looking over your own shoulder the next time you're all alone in the house and hear an unexplained noise.

For a third installment in a horror series, ""Paranormal Activity 3"" exceeds all expectations.  A spooky film that builds to a truly frightening third act, ""3"" succeeds in deepening the story created by the first two installments without wearing out our interest - the filmmakers know that we're here to get scared, not to get a PhD-level understanding of Toby . . . and scare you they do.  Terrific stuff.",1335744000,5,2872,4.780933062880324
4345653,4,B004EPZ02A,"First off, I should say that I LOVED parts one and two. The first two relied more heavily on very slow-building tension. These predecessors basically ""taught"" viewers how to watch these movies in the first 20-30 minutes by offering numerous subtle, relatively unimportant objects moving as if a spectral breeze had shifted them. This way when such production devices became important, the viewer had a trained eye--not unlike what was done with White Noise. These movies convey a style that is very unusual. So it came as no surprise to me that there was little middle ground in people's opinions of them; they loved'em or hated'em. I love'em. Why? Because my senses are all on full power; I'm all in; I'm practically concentrating on the screen and listening to every creak trying to sleuth out the next clue that something fishy is going on in that house. Some people may call this ""work"". I call it cool. [But people chatting during the movie are a much greater distraction than normal under the circumstances.]

This third installment was my least favorite, but I can totally understand why it may be others' favorite. While it still employed subtle moving objects, it did it less, instead relying on more mainstream devices to provoke scared jumps from the audience. It also borrowed more heavily from the Poltergeist movies than the first two--not that I minded. The characters' investigation into the strange goings-on was more methodical and plot-driven. The first two were more event-driven and investigated more out of fear and curiosity. The differences between 3 and 1 & 2 were subtle, but numerous, chief amongst them being that ""the paranormal"" functions as a character in this movie, rather than a mysterious ""force"" in the first two. As such, the actions of ""the paranormal"" were more blatant and felt more like ""it"" was doing something ""to someone"" whereas in 1 & 2 it was more like ""something was happening"" to someone in a haunted house.

The plot is simple. A family lives in a house. Weird things start happening. Step-dad starts putting cameras around the house. Things get weirder. And from there anything more would give too much away. But while the first two movies' endings left us largely to wild speculation, I will say that this one ends with something of an explanation of the paranormal activity.

It doesn't really matter in which order you watch these movies. However, each sequel (or in this case prequel) was designed to mold over the events of the previous installment. So watch them in order if it's convenient. I also demand you watch these with the lights off. It makes it easier to avoid distractions while you're concentrating on the screen.",1335225600,2,2682,4.903083700440528

4345789,3,B004EPZ02A,"Out of the 3 Paranormal movies, this was my least favorite. Not to say it wasn't good. The movie dates back to the 80's and follows the childhood of the women from Paranormal 2. They have to use VHS tapes & come up with creative ways to capture video like attaching a camera to a fan that rotates back & forth. The fan actually gave the movie some suspense as it panned slowly back & forth you become anxious waiting to see if there will suddenly be something there that wasn't before.

The storyline itself was interesting. But this was much less scary than the previous 2. There is an explanation at the end about how and why everything happened which also leads to an explanation for the 2nd movie. I also noticed many scenes from the trailer were not present in the movie which was a little disappointing. Overall, it was a decent suspense movie but based on the 1st two, and the trailer, I think it could have been better.

4345794,3,B004EPZ02A,"This third venture into the lives of sisters Kristi and Katie being haunted by a demon is more back-story than scary.

You'll discover the origin of the Paranormal Activity. While the DVD boasts, ""The last 15 minutes will mess you up for life"" have no fear - it really won't. It just provides the explanation.

Back in the 80s when Kristi and Katie were young girls, their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis, move into a new home. Dennis videotapes weddings and so we have our collection of video recordings of how this new house is haunted.

Kristi has an invisible friend named Toby and this thing wants something; least of all being called fat. (""Don't call him fat"")  Katie doesn't believe Kristi at first. Then she plays Bloody Mary with Dennis' assistant and the house begins to come apart.

While there are a few jump-in-your-seat scares, this film simply cannot recapture the building dread of the original. (But I will admit that a scare involving a closet did cause my heart to literally stop for a split second.) You'll get the multiple camera angels: two bedroom shots and the kitchen. You'll get the sudden kitchen scares and the camera-on-the-oscillating fan gimmick does provide a couple nice effects.

They left enough story open in order to continue the saga if they wish (and they will).

I remember being frightened by the original and then intrigued by the simple genius of the filmmakers. With the two sequels, I seem to have lost whatever ""fun"" I had. It's almost like the Matrix movies where the original was superb but the sequels were just too heavy for their own good.

Sometimes I wish Hollywood would leave well enough alone and not rush sequels.",1332201600,,1680,4.768965517241379

4345866,3,B004EPZ02A,"The first Paranormal Activity was great, even after a long line of first person style of shooting. Blaire Witch set the standards and a few other competent films have followed. Paranormal the First created a new precedent of special effects, seemingly before your eyes. Whether its all post-edit computer effects can be argued, but the result is effective.

The second installment seemed to rest on the hype alone and had no real follow-up from the first. I am not even sure if was the same house. Which dulls any later attempts because now the idea of what became Paranormal is not just random acts of ghostly stuff. One can get the same benefit from Discover Channel's ""A Haunting"".

With the third installment, again, its another family. No history of anything is recalled or brought into play. This film has a larger family. A husband, wife and two daughters. Why these hauntings occur does not ever surface. The husband notices things and so this justifies him placing cameras in the house. The mother refuses to view any of it, so naturally she never spots anything. Throughout, her daughter talks to a Toby, which she believes is her daughters imaginary friend and says its a passing phase for a few weeks. We learn that Toby is the evil spirit behind all the happenings.

Thats really the essence of the story. From that we are treated with some scary and creepy moments of ghostly raptures, telekinetic activity, other such nuisances. I believe some back story would create a deeper and emotional scare rather than just shock scares. My problem with handheld camera movies is that, almost under no circumstances to do these people relieve themselves of the camera for something as dire as surviving or protecting their loved ones. Towards the end, we see the mother in a situation, and the husband, while asking if she is ok, continues to hold the camera. We know she is in trouble, and he is not exactly in a safe spot either. I say ""drop the camera!!"" I know it's all for effect, but the realism is removed in those instances. This is not the only film that does that, but I still get pulled out of the movie or lose sympathy for the people.

Paranormal still has scary and creepy moments that will sure make it a worthwhile viewing. And I say it is worth seeing. For all intents and purposes it is a well done film that is probably just as scary as the previous bunch.",1331424000,,2380,4.632701421800948

4345869,3,B004EPZ02A,"""Paranormal Activity 3"" attempts to tie the first two movies of the series together.  In this installment, we see how the storyline from the earlier films began.

Julie, along with her young daughters Katie, Kristi, and live-in boyfriend Dennis have just moved into a new home.  Once settled, strange occurances start happening.  Videographer Dennis immediately sets up cameras throughout the house, hoping to capture anything strange on tape.  Meanwhile, Kristi has developed an imaginary friend she calls Toby.  With some prodding from her mom, Kristi reveals that Toby has been speaking to her.  Even more confused and anxious now, Dennis continues his monitoring.  He has even set up a camera on an old oscillating fan base.

As the movie progresses, the bumps and noises turn into other more scary things, such as beds being moved across the room and items crashing to the floor.  In the end, the  evil forces unleash their full fury upon the family.

While there are some truly scary parts in this movie, such as when Randy and one of the girls shut themselves in the bathroom and say ""Bloody Mary"" three times to when Katie is suspended in air by her hair, overall I thought the first two movies were scarier.  I thought that the oscillating camera was a nice trick, and the anticipation of watching the camera slowly pan from one room to the other helped add to the suspense of the movie.  That said, I just didn't get as scared as I did after seeing parts one and two.

I am a fan of this movie trilogy and I think each movie has varying levels of suspense and terror.  Part 3 is not necessarily a bad movie; it's just not as scary as the earlier films in the series.  If you've seen the first two movies in the series, then deifinitely watch this one; just be prepared to not be scared quite as much.",1330905600,,1810,4.588785046728972

Then another point that irritated me was all this stuff was happening and Micah says don't call the demonologist. .""What?"" and of course by the time they did he was out of town.

This entire series of movies was mediocre, with painfully delivered dialogue and only your basic boo-and-jump moments scattered through. This one was easily the worst of the three as it brought in the element of a coven of old lady witches to explain the ""origins"" of the fictional villain. The parallel was unnecessary in that it brought no additional believability or involvement to the story, much like the map argument in Blair Witch.

4345952,3,B004EPZ02A,"The original Paranormal Activity was one of those wonderful stories of a no-budget project striking it rich.  The inevitable sequel managed to avoid the common ""bigger is better"" mentality of most sequels to actually rival, if not surpass its original.  Expectations, then, were understandably high for this third entry in the franchise.  Unfortunately, the ""rule of three"" rears its ugly head this time out.  Paranormal Activity 3, while containing some very inventive moments, ultimately represents the typical ""bare-bones story to hang a bunch of creepy shots on"" mindset.

If you don't know by now, this entry attempts to give us some backstory on the sisters of the first two films.  Thus, from its inception, the movie has an uphill battle to fight.  If George Lucas has taught us anything, it's that your backstory should always remain just that ... backstory...  not your main plot.

A brief opening segment shows us the sisters just before the tragic events unfold, as they discover a box of VHS tapes from their childhood.  From here we dive into 1988 and a young Katie and Kristi with their mother Julie, and Dennis, her new live-in boyfriend.  The film wastes no time jumping into the ""bumps in the night"" sequences that induce Dennis to setup the requisite cameras around the house... his being a wedding videographer serving as the explanation for why he has access to so much equipment, which would have been VERY expensive back in its day.  The movie does not deviate from the formula of alternating nighttime segments with the follow up reactions to watching the footage and the inevitable climax of ""activity"" and tragedy.  By now, you know most of what's going to happen, and the film largely relies more on jump scares (many of them cheap fake-outs) than the genuine creepiness of its predecessors (save for one masterful moment involving a babysitter).  The one real innovation this time out is a camera placed on the base of an oscillating fan which slowly pans between the kitchen and living room.  It's pretty incredible how suspenseful a slow, repetitive pan can be, and the two or three sequences that play off this concept are the only real highlights of the film.

From the get go, the film presents its weakest element, and that is lack of sympathetic characters.  The children, while cute, are underdeveloped as characters and not particularly convincing in their acting. The adults, meanwhile, are easily the most cardboard and generic characters to come out of this series.  The few characters from outside the family are not even remotely sketched out enough to generate any interest either.  In the previous films, the segments between the nighttime scenes were slowly giving us some insight into the families and friends ... filling in a little detail without losing sight of the main story.  In this film, we learn nothing about the girls' mother ... why is she single?  Where is the father?  Who is this boyfriend and how has he come into the picture?  We certainly don't expect to focus on any of these things - but some sense that they have an existence outside the elements of the film would go a long way toward humanizing them.

The bulk of the film plays out as expected, and isn't too bad, even if it is growing all too familiar.  However, a late in the film relocation of the action seems to completely destroy any momentum, and the finale suffers for it.

In the end, we haven't really learned much about the background of the girls that we didn't already know from the snippets of conversation in the previous two films.  Sadly, one of the chief mysteries, that of the half-burned polaroid from the first film, remains unresolved ... leaving room, I suppose, for another prequel.

Now, if I may vent for a moment... the problem with trotting a one-trick pony out too many times is that the flaws start to become harder to put out of your mind.  Chief among them being that which is the bane of any mock-umentary, and that is the increasing unlikelihood that characters facing an immediate threat to their lives would continue to film their demise from a shoulder mounted camera.  In key moments, rather than being terrified at how Dennis might escape the menace that is barreling down on him and the young girls, I found myself wondering why he doesn't drop the camera and bolt out the door.

Add to this the illogic that we have a man who hears noises coming from a kids bedroom storage closet, and then promptly sets up a camera that DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CLOSET IN THE SHOT!  Rather, he is focused on the girls' beds.  Even after Kristi has a conversation with ""something"" in the closet which is just off camera, still Dennis does not think to re-orient the camera to the closet door.

Likewise mind-boggling is setting up a camera in the living room, where nothing has been happening at all!  Again, we know these are cheats for the sake of the audience, and when the idea was fresh in the first two movies, we simply overlooked them - but when the story becomes so threadbare as to no longer engage our minds, we can't help but go there.

And the film goes beyond that - it is littered with scenes that would send any real life person running out the door, yet somehow we are asked to accept that after a girl is lifted in the air by her hair in her bedroom, that very night she will still sleep in the same room.  When Julie is fed up with Dennis' cameras, she shouts at him ... ""this ends TOMORROW!""  I laughed to myself ... ""Tomorrow!?""  Wouldn't a seriously pissed off person say it ends NOW!?  But of course, that would mean the movie is over!  Even after relocating to her mother's house, Dennis still sets up the camera in their bedroom ... ""How much longer are you going to videotape?"" Julie asks. Dennis answers, in a serious example of how little the producers cared about scripting, ""Until this is all over, I guess.""  Bam, done ... there's a camera set up in their bedroom, accept it!

The official trailer was apparently packed with scenes that do not exist in the final film, neither the theatrical nor the director's cut.  I suppose this was a ploy to keep audiences from being able to predict the scares of the movie - but I couldn't help but feel that the movie I had EXPECTED to see from the trailer might have been a much better movie than what we actually got.  In short, while I was entertained by it, after the fact I felt the film wasted its potential to really delve into the girls and their story, and instead delivered us the inevitable formula approach - ""just turn out the lights and make things suddenly move and get loud.""  At this point, the series has really tapped out its potential, and its time to move on to other things.  But, when a studio smells cash, well, you know what happens...",1329264000,3,6772,4.64261744966443

The only gripe I have is that the girls who have gone through this traumatic experience, in particular, the end scene...so how did life go on as normal for them? In parts one and two, they refer to their experiences merely in passing yet what we see here is utter terror. The grandma? What became of her and what did she do with the girls?

For instance, I thought that the camera mounted to a makeshift oscillating fan was genius as it was a unique way of building suspense.

Basically you have to be invested in the story and it's a good one.  In PA #1 and PA #2 we have two sisters who slowly come to realize that there is something supernatural going on in their homes.  It's alluded that something happened in their childhood, something they seem to have forgotten about or buried in their memories that might be linked to what is going on in their homes.  Each installment of the Paranormal series has a reason why their homes are being video taped and PA #3 is no exception.

In PA #3, we are taken back to the sisters as little girls, living with their Mom and stepfather.  In short time, strange things start to happen, loud unexplained noises, movement, and Toby, who is Kristi's imaginary playmate.  The stepfather videos weddings for a living and knows a lot about cameras so he sets up a 24/7 surveillance of the house in all rooms.  In the kitchen having a camera panning left to right you might think the most horrifying reveal might be dirty dishes in the sink but you get much more than that.

As always this PA movie has it's viewers trained to always be on guard.  This is one of those movies that you might have to watch  through little spaces between your fingers as you peek through your hands as they cover your eyes.  I've glad I don't remember the trailer for this movie because I understand many viewers were upset that most of these scenes were not included in the actual movie.

Where this movie fails is that it's way too short and even though this is a horror film it's also a mystery and it sort of cheapens #3 in that you know so much is left out so they can make PA #4.

4346176,2,B004EPZ02A,"You know, I've been a fan of these Paranormal Activity movies since it debuted a few years ago. The first and second movies were pretty decent, although you can tell they were made on a low-budget. The first two relied more on getting to know the characters and heavily on very slow-building tension, which is why I loved them so much. That makes me wonder why this one just went off-track. PA3 is, quite literally, a weak mess of a movie. You'd think these guys would up the wow factor of this movie, considering how the first two were, but no. I know they were trying to tell the backstory to the series but they could do that and still wow us. The acting was very dry and that made it unbelievable to me. I mean, the knockoff movie:Paranormal Entity, was way better than this one. I was really disappointed and just can't recommend anyone buy this movie. If you can find it in a bargain bin somewheres, okay-maybe then.

So that's still up in the air. Unlike PA2 which was also a prequel, but then continued on where PA left off, this one doesn't do that. It has it's own ending, completely unrelated to PA2. So now PA2 and PA3's endings are both unanswered. So hopefully PA4 will tie everything up and they will stop making them, which they should've done after the first one.

My favorite one of the three is Paranormal Activity, the first one. I think it's appeal is the way it was shot. It made it seem like it could be happening in anyone's house. After seeing it, I couldn't stop talking about it for a week. PA2 and PA3, not so much. One more thing I will say re: PA3 is about the panning camera effect. That was clever and added a different twist to the cameras. So if you're a fan of this series, see all three. But for Me, Paranormal Activity is the best one hands down.

As things steadily grow out of control, dark family secrets are revealed until, finally, all hell breaks loose. I found PA3 to be a modest improvement over its predecessor; though it's tough for any horror sequel not to run out of steam with each new installment, this one still manages to provide some suitably chilling moments.

The 3rd of them though... I'll start by saying it does have good scares in it, not much real chills like the other two, but still some scares. You won't sit curled up in a ball covering your eyes the whole movie, its more traditional jump at you scares.
But the story is what gets me. It doesn't quite make sense for rooms to be tossed around, kids screaming, and the grown-ups in the film don't hear it. Or that the boyfriend is filming everything, gets some amazing footage, and doesn't force the mother to sit down and watch whats happening to her kids at night. And the end... It left me so dissapointed. Unless they are setting it up for Paranormal 4, it makes absolutely no sense with the first two. Both of the earlier films mention a fire that wipes out the house, and never mentions what happens to the mother and boyfriend. Not to spoil too much, but you do get the impression the whole family moved away together and alive, so how does the end of this movie fit into it? Answer, it doesn't.

for one, the single most annoying thing about this flick is the fact that so many scenes, scenes depicted in the trailer, did not even make the final cut. there is controversy surrounding these decisions, but as a movie goer expecting to see what was advertised, it is gravely disappointing to wait to see what seems like a scarey part in the previews to not even take place in the actual film. lame,  inexcusable, and downright false advertising, if you ask me. two, i didn't exactly have a stop watch going but i swear, in the theater, this felt like the shortest major motion picture of all time.  if it lasted 1 hour and 10 mins that is a generous estimate. is there any merit to this film?? you betcha...

although they keep repeating a lot of the same scares, at least this time they do it with a little twist. instead of the stationary video camera from the other two offerings,  they rig it up to an oscilating fan that pans side to side which was a cool effect. also, there absolutely are some good creeps and scares in this and without a doubt, the ending is a major shock and scare (getting goosebumps even thinking about it). trust me, there are definitely some good frights in this film but as i said, if you think good horror is seeing someone disembowled and than fileted on a grill, you won't like it. (knowing that kids today think they are above anything remotely supernatural and that it could never be contrived as frightening is the real horror in this society to me)

if you enjoyed the first two films, i'm sure you will like it...just don't expect to see exactly what you saw in the previews because it's not here. i haven't yet gotten this on dvd so there may be some 'deleted scenes' bonus but, those scenes still were not in the true film and as i said, it is majorly annoying. if you haven't seen any of these films and especially if you didn't like them, i don't see how this film will change your mind on paranormal activity. as i said, there are definitely some cool and genuine scares but as a whole, it falls short.",1327622400,11,2931,4.368807339449542

4346537,4,B004EPZ02A,"Let me preface this review by saying I thought all three Paranormal Activity movies were decent.  If you didn't like the first two, you won't like this one and that's all there is to it, but fans of the first two movies shouldn't be turned off by the continuation of this franchise.

Paranormal Activity 3 makes a half-hearted effort, in the beginning, to tie the story to the first two movies, but that effort ends quickly and the movie becomes tied to the first two in style alone after that.  Although I thought the story of the first two movies was OK, I wouldn't exactly call it their strength.  What made the first two films so good was the anticipation of something scary.  When that clock on the camera slowed down, you knew you should be on the look out for something, but half of you was afraid of what you would see.

Paranormal Activity 3 plays off of this element, but adds a whole new level.  With a panning camera in one room and different camera views throughout the house, you were never sure which camera would show something when.  The scares are a bit more deliberate and less suggestive than the first two movies, but the added visual makes for some incredibly intense moments.  Involving two young girls who both do a stellar job acting just adds to the suspense.  You'll find yourself questioning why the man in the movie chooses to take a camera with him during some of the more frightening scenes, but if you're able to suspend your questioning of logic, it's very entertaining.

This isn't the scariest movie ever made, but it does a good job keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat and these days, there aren't too many horror films that even accomplish that.",1327622400,7,1691,4.529605263157895

4346539,4,B004EPZ02A,"I am a fan of the Paranormal Activity franchise and went to the theater opening weekend to see parts 1 and 2. I was excited about Part 3, but for some reason, not excited enough to go to the theater to see it.

We rented paranormal Activity 3 the day it came out on Redbox and I was excited to watch it. I like scary movies but don't like to watch them alone. My teenage children were home so it was a good time to get ""scared"".

This movie does a good job of explaining the origin of the ""curse"" and has some pretty scary parts in it. Overall, the actors do a good job. The younger Katie and Kristi actors are amazing, especially little Katie. She really makes her role believable.

Before this movie I never really thought about camera angles and how they affect a film. But after watching Paranormal Activity 3, I noticed just how much camera angles and movement can affect the viewer. Some scenes were very suspenseful simply due to the way the camera was positioned/moving.

There were a couple, ok a few...times when I screamed out loud or talked to the characters like they could actually her me. (Anyone else do that?)

I will say this...There are a couple of scenes in the movie where I thought to myself, ""I cannot believe the just did that to the little girl""...Some scenes push the envelope, but not too far in my opinion.

Conclusion, this is a good movie and offers a few good scares with alot of suspense. But in my opinion, no sequel or prequel will ever outdo the original Paranormal Activity movie.",1327622400,5,1516,4.415770609318996
4346540,5,B004EPZ02A,"This last installment completely did it for me. The sound was better. The acting was, too. There wasn't as much down time. And, the little girl and her relationship with Tobey gives the 'entity' more shape and gives us something to be afraid of, instead of just ghastly faces on the screen. (It seems there's something about children in horror movies that can 'turn up the scare.' Do we put ourselves in their situation?) The brief research done by Dennis gives us some background on what might be happening in the house.

I thought the first was good. The second was disappointing. This one has to be my favorite.

If you're going to watch this, do it right, i.e., by yourself and at night! If it didn't scare you, maybe it's because people were laughing at it around you in the theater. Also, I never saw the trailer and its extra scenes.",1327622400,2,840,4.519736842105263

I have never watched any of the paranormal movies before, because I thought they were all cheese, until I bought this one out of boredom. This movie is a combination  Reminiscent of (Poltergeist and the Entity). Oh my God did this movie scare the crap out of me, creeped me out and made me very nervous. A movie that does that to me is damn good! I must say I was very impressed by this movie. My hats off to the producers. Well done guys! Maintain the same standard in this movie and you guys will always hit a home run every time! I highly recommend this movie, so buy it and appreciate it. Buy it now!!!",1327536000,,669,4.1461538461538465
4346662,3,B004EPZ02A,"I just got the movie and watched it.  Pathetic.  Only word for it.  I graded 3/5 because as a stand-alone movie, it's decent.  As a continuation of the series, it absolutely sucks.  PA1 was great.  PA2 expanded upon PA1, answering some questions and opening up more.  Then we get PA3, which is about as boring as possible.  The first 90% of the movie consists of objects mystically moving on camera, doors mysteriously closing, etc.  Where have we all seen that before?

The ending is at least somewhat interesting, though it's also so obvious what's going to happen it takes all the suspense out of it, which just kills it.  This movie contributes nothing to the franchise other than the revelation that it was the grandmother who made the deal with the demon, which really means nothing since we already knew it was a previous-generations relative.

Oh, and the cliffhanger at the end of PA2, ""Katie and Hunter's whereabouts remain unknown""?  Not answered.  Not even addressed.  Not even so much as an indicator the filmmaker's even remembered it.  I suppose they're just leaving the door open for PA4, which I pray is better than this.",1327536000,,1138,4.788659793814433

This one after 20 minutes starts up the activities heavy.  But still doesn't explain at the end exactly what is doing the haunting?  Witches?  Bloody Mary?  Demons?  Largely leaves the events of the first two still up in limbo.

A bit deceiving as they don't have many of the scenes from the trailer in the actual movie just like they did in the second one.  You know where Katie walks into the room from the bathroom in the second one.  The third one does this even more.  The bathroom scene with the person showing after they say the words.  Not in movie.  The pyshic guy from the trailer.  Not in the movie either.  A bit dissappointing that you use cut scenes to advertise the movie.",1327536000,,818,4.324503311258278
4346664,2,B004EPZ02A,"First of all, the movie it self really wasn't that bad. But I think that it is wrong to show people a trailer of a movie like this to get them to watch it or buy it, and then when you watch the movie for yourself your expecting to see those scenes in the movie, and you never do or they change something about it. They were alot of scenes that were cut out of this movie that were showed on the trailer letting people believe that what they showed on the trailer was in the movie.
  I'm not going to go into much detail. But one of the scenes that I'm talking about is the bathroom scene with the two little girls. Not what the trailer showed at all.
  If they are going to cut the scenes out of the movie that were on the trailer that your expecting to see, at least they could show them as deleted scenes or something like that in the speceal features.
  Movie did have good sound and picture quality. If it was not for the misleading trailer. I would have given this movie 4 stars.",1327449600,7,984,4.072538860103627
4346665,2,B004EPZ02A,"The Irish critic Vivian Mercier said of the two-act Samuel Beckett play that in it, ""nothing happens, twice.""  With the Paranormal Activity franchise we now have a trilogy in which nothing happens thrice.  I can barely forgive myself for seeing the second one after thinking of the first one that if they had spent another day and another couple hundred dollars, perhaps there could have been some actual event in the film.  And now that I've seen the third one, I just want to stab out my own eyes and shove chopsticks into my tympanic membranes to prevent myself ever again paying for this inert junk.

I understand the idea of dread gradually building up over time.  I agree that in general, this method provides a far creepier, scarier, more satisfying horror experience than does a frenetic spray of viscera and gore aimed at the screen.  But waiting through scenes of endlessly panning camera shots (the use of a oscillating fan as a camera mount was a nice touch, however) for something, anything to happen gets BORING.  And my idea of an action film is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Dinner-with-Andre-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B001WLMOLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Dinner with Andre (The Criterion Collection)</a>, so I'm not exactly ADHD in my entertainment demands.

I think a judicious editing together of all three films into one compact, 90-minute anthology would result in a very chilling, dread-filled, satisfying movie experience.  Yes, some of the mounting dread would be short-circuited that way.  Complex fear cannot be distilled and concentrated into some quick, easy formula.

4346668,3,B004EPZ02A,"Okay, I LOVED this movie in the theater!  It was scary and kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through it!

So I rushed out and got this on the very first day it was released and I eagerly watched it.  It was just as good on my TV as it was in the theaters.  I wasn't as scared cuz I knew what was going to happen, but I was excited to see that there was a ""Extended Version!""  I eagerly clicked on that and watched it with my girlfriend.  However from what I could see, there was only one thing that was different.  There's a scene where Dennis gets up in the middle of the night cuz he hears something and he grabs the camera.  He goes to the window and something rattles the window.  That's it.  Not really worth the extra money if you ask me.

I only have one actual complaint about the movie itself.  They use modern catch phrases in a movie that was set in the 80's.  The phrases, ""That just happened!"" and ""Seriously!?!"" Those phrases didn't exist back then, so they shouldn't be in this movie!

Ever since the first Paranormal Activity movie came out I was waiting for them to put a commentary on one of these movies so I could hear more about this movie series and how the movies were made, but I have yet to get a Paranormal Activity with a commentary, or some interviews, or SOMETHING other than just the movie itself.

Sure there was a few extra ""scares"" where Dennis scares his wife in the style of MTV's Jackass, and a commercial that Dennis made for his little business of filming weddings.  But that's it, that's all that's on this Blu Ray.

So if all you're really looking for is the movie itself, then you'll be very happy with this movie, but if you wanted some extra features on this disc, you're gonna be disappointed.",1327363200,5,1746,4.2265861027190335

This is a prequel to the first two and goes back to 1988 when sisters Katie (PA 1) and Kristi (PA 2) were young girls and get their first haunted house experience...thanks a lot grandma!

PA 3 does have an innovative idea that really works.  Dennis mounts the camera on a rotating fan so that he can pan across the kitchen into the dining room and foyer.

And furthermore if you watched all three films closely they left it open for a 4th movie to answer other questions like what happened to the mother? What happened in 1992 (look closely at the box of video tapes in the first movie)? Etc..
Basically the movie itself had the typical startle moments whether you expect them or not and a final scene that made everyone I know cringe!

4346837,4,B004EPZ02A,"First off, I should say that I LOVED parts one and two. The first two relied more heavily on very slow-building tension. These predecessors basically ""taught"" viewers how to watch these movies in the first 20-30 minutes by offering numerous subtle, relatively unimportant objects moving as if a spectral breeze had shifted them. This way when such production devices became important, the viewer had a trained eye--not unlike what was done with White Noise. These movies convey a style that is very unusual. So it came as no surprise to me that there was little middle ground in people's opinions of them; they loved'em or hated'em. I love'em. Why? Because my senses are all on full power; I'm all in; I'm practically concentrating on the screen and listening to every creak trying to sleuth out the next clue that something fishy is going on in that house. Some people may call this ""work"". I call it cool. [But people chatting during the movie are a much greater distraction than normal under the circumstances.]

This third installment was my least favorite, but I can totally understand why it may be others' favorite. While it still employed subtle moving objects, it did it less, instead relying on more mainstream devices to provoke scared jumps from the audience. It also borrowed more heavily from the Poltergeist movies than the first two--not that I minded. The characters' investigation into the strange goings-on was more methodical and plot-driven. The first two were more event-driven and investigated more out of fear and curiosity. The differences between 3 and 1 & 2 were subtle, but numerous, chief amongst them being that ""the paranormal"" functions as a character in this movie, rather than a mysterious ""force"" in the first two. As such, the actions of ""the paranormal"" were more blatant and felt more like ""it"" was doing something ""to someone"" whereas in 1 & 2 it was more like ""something was happening"" to someone in a haunted house.

The plot is simple. A family lives in a house. Weird things start happening. Step-dad starts putting cameras around the house. Things get weirder. And from there anything more would give too much away. But while the first two movies' endings left us largely to wild speculation, I will say that this one ends with something of an explanation of the paranormal activity.

It doesn't really matter in which order you watch these movies. However, each sequel (or in this case prequel) was designed to mold over the events of the previous installment. So watch them in order if it's convenient. I also demand you watch these with the lights off. It makes it easier to avoid distractions while you're concentrating on the screen.",1326844800,10,2682,4.903083700440528

I'm a scary movie buff and of course after watching the first and second paranormal activity I was hooked on these types of movies. This movie is done much in the same way, with the whole film being shot as a series of ""home movies"", and much like the other movies paranormal happenings do not start happening right in the beginning, as there is a little bit of a story line to go with the scaryness. I will admit that even I didn't catch on to what was happening until the last seconds of the movie, and right as you figure out what is happening the movie ends. But I have to say that I will be buying this movie and that every penny will be worth each scream and jump that I experience.

This is, in my mind, better than the first two in every single way. I have never screamed in a movie and it was bad at the theatre when i was with my friends i wouldn't let go of my friends arm cause i was so scared and when i let go of my friends arm there was a sweat mark on her sleeve, that's how scared i was.

4346841,1,B004EPZ02A,"I went to see this movie in the theater and really was disappointed in it.  I think the main reason that I was so disappointed was the fact that over 80 percent of the trailer was not in the movie and the scenes that were cut were really the reasons why I wanted to go see the movie.  I thought, initially, that there were going to be a lot more questions answered like the fire and what happened to their mother, but this was just a subpar movie with nothing really answered.  There are a few scares and the ending of the movie is pretty messed up but otherwise this movie kind of plays like the others and leaves you with more questions than answers which I thought we were going to get.  Now I fear we may get yet another prequel to the series with PA 4 when really I think most fans just want to find out what went wrong with Katie and her sister, the fire, etc and move on.  I'm curious as to what happened to the baby at the end of PA 2 (will this ever be answered?) and there are some other questions that I have but I don't want to waste time on that.  The movie just wasn't that good due to the trailer scenes being cut and you know something is wrong when, and I'm not joking, when the movie was over people in the audience said, ""What?  That's it?!""  I think it was kind of a bad judgement call from the producers and directors to cut so much of the trailer out of the movie as this is the reason why people come to the movies based off what they see in the trailer.  In the future maybe you should release a plot synoposis and no trailer that way you give people no expectations of the movie.  Oh and to anyone who likes to go to scary movies to jump and yell and act stupid please stay away.  I actually had people in the theater I was in jumping at everything and screaming at everything and I swear there was one guy that was so scared he was ready to walk out.  Really?!!  Grow up and stop ruining movies for everyone else.  That's not really anything about the movie just people in the theater in general and I thought I'd put that out there.  Getting back to the movie though, it was just ok for me.  I think if the producers and director would have not shown too much in a trailer or a finished trailer then this movie would have been good.  I just think most people were a little disappointed that they didn't get to see the fire, the mother dragged down the hall and slammed on the bed, the little girl throwing water at the entity, the girl jumping down the stairs, the entity in the bathroom with the girls as they play bloody mary, the dad play the knocking game at the closet and the medium or preacher or whatever he is getting his head slammed off the table and pulled backward, etc.  I think if they wouldn't have shown these parts in the trailer then they wouldn't have gotten people's hopes up and ultimatly squashed them.  Next time show us a finished trailer so we know what we're getting.  Hopefully PA 4 will be better.  Hopefully!",1323820800,5,2965,4.166666666666667
4346942,5,B004EPZ02A,Saw this with my sister at the theater and was waiting for it to be really bad like the critics said it was gonna be. Read  reviews saying nothing in the trailer was in the movie so I was expecting the worse. When it started playing we were scared out of our seats. From the very beginning to the end you can expect some scary stuff going on. Out of all the paranormal movies this one is my favorite by far. And i actually like that nothing in the trailer showed up cause it made the movie more creepy. Gonna buy it as soon as it comes out. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,1322956800,,560,4.090909090909091
4346943,3,B004EPZ02A,"PA1 was fantastic. Really had you checking under your bed. PA2 was great too. The guys basically handled the haunting in the  same way, but you'd expect that as these story lines happened parallel to each other (same time period). But, it's like they slapped PA3 together like late homework. Then there's the same story line with oh, something's happening so the guy puts up cameras and nobody notices what's on the film til it's too late. The people that made PA1 and PA2 showed a true gift. Guess the gift ran out!",1322697600,2,516,4.548387096774194

4346946,4,B004EPZ02A,"Saw this movie on opening night, I was very excited but also ready to be a little disappointed, luckily I wasn't. This movie really gave a better insight about why a demon has been following the family around for the past twenty years. I also understood the characteristics of Toby a little better than most (obviously) because I have an idea of how demons behave. Prey on the children and manipulating them while at the same time wreaking havoc, which really made the movie flow better, since it had a hold of Katie from the get go, but more violently than voluntarily with her sister. Overall, four stars since I did go WTF a few times during the movie and jump a couple of times (more because I'm sensitive to sudden loud noises than anything, but I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt :] )",1321747200,,800,4.448979591836735
4346947,3,B004EPZ02A,"PA1 scared me. I was checking over my shoulder looking out for any malevolent entities in my house. I adapted to the style, which is why PA2 was less scary. Sure, it had some tense moments but it was the same movie as the first.

PA3 is like PA2. It will make you jump a few times but by now you're getting used to it, so it's losing its power. I predicted the plot for PA3 once a certain character was introduced. The film runs like Blair Witch in the end and leaves a ton of unanswered questions.

Not bad. It's just human nature to adjust to something once you've experienced it enough times.",1321660800,6,595,4.2105263157894735
4346948,3,B004EPZ02A,"Though I have mixed feeling about this film, I can't say I wasn't warned by watching the first two films. The film settles into the same tone as the first two releases and creates the same sort of atmosphere. You can expect the same results from this movie as the others, speaking of an increase in activity near the end of the film. I have to admit there were some good ""make you jump"" segments which I did just that.

I did watch this film in the theater, which I feel takes some of the scary feeling away with other people sitting a few rows away. I recommend watching it, at home, alone, in the dark for a better atmosphere and then, it could be possible that you will be looking in all the dark areas of the house before going to bed. That's to say you can.

4346949,4,B004EPZ02A,"Paranormal Activity 3 relies on minimal scares in the beginning and gradually builds up to some more shocking situations later. With video cameras posted around the house we get to see what is going on at night. The mundane things we hear at night like furnaces clicking or wind blowing are at first made to look normal, but as the film progresses they become more insidious. The directors at first use special effects sparingly, instead waiting to build suspense throughout the film. A sheet creeps up behind the baby sitter only to collapse to the floor with nobody under it. Furniture and beds start to move and the sounds through the house seem like they are under control. Unlike so many modern horror films special effects here are needed only to enhance the documentary realism of the film.  Maybe these paranormal films have been successful because people are no longer swayed by elaborate out-of- this-world special effects.

When the director has convinced us that something is indeed going on he pulls out the punches. One the girl's has her hair pulled in mid-air by an invisible entity. The bed in the room starts to move violently. The family is forced to move to their grandmother's house where things get a lot creepier and the two unfortunate parents meets their demise by a Covent of ghoulish witches.

This film could have gotten ridiculous like the Poltergeist films, which were more like an amusement park rides than movies. I find those kinds of film neither suspenseful nor scary. Actually, many times they are actually funny.

What I liked about Paranormal Activity 3 is the film makers leave the situations up to your imagination. I like looking in the background for subtle supernatural hints being filmed by the camera. Sometimes something will flash by the camera that some in the audience will miss.

This is now the third Paranormal Activity film, and one wonders how long this gimmick can last. Nobody really knows how long these ""docu-horror film"" can last, but the Blair Witch Project was the first of these films and that was back in 1999.",1320710400,,2073,4.844632768361582

I am not a fan of this series. The stories are too slow to build with long scenes of nothing and then the scare is minimal. This movie is the spoiler for the series as we find out from the subtitle ""It runs in the family."" We do get an explanation. This is a prequel filmed in high quality DVD using a VHS camera. The acting was better in this one. Lauren Bittner was convincing as Julie. In one scene she puts on a mask and scares the guys. She is so happy she got one over on them, she jumps around with bubbly joy. Also extremely realistic is young Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) who convinces me she has an imaginary friend named Captain Howdy, er ah Toby.  Likewise child actor Chloe Csengery did an excellent job as Katie as she goes screaming across the room.

There is a sex scene that is comical. Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) starts out mouthing ""wack-a-da, wack-a-da"" porno music and as a romantic sort stampedes right to Julie's chest. There are some strange events going on in the house, so it gets wired for VHS tapes. Now as I recall the longest VHS tape setting was 6 hours (some were 8 hours) which means they would of had to been changed out frequently and viewed for paranormal activity with some scenes lasting for a second. With multiple cameras going 24/7...well you get the idea of how tedious and impracticable this becomes. In one scene the stationary VHS camera is looking at the entire girl's bedroom and then the next second it is focusing on Kristi's bed. While they used the amateur camera for a realistic effect, they didn't stay true to it, which made for a better movie. Maybe one day they will discover how real movies are made.

What is not credible is the wife not believing what is going on and refusing to look at the evidence on film. They had to do this so they could keep the constant build up. Dennis filming everything with the camera at grandma's house didn't make much sense. At some point if you are being chased, you stop filming and run. If you are hiding and need to be quiet, you don't keep the camera on. The chase scene is hard to justify filming in all of these types of movies. I felt a little short changed on the ending.

Like the other movies, it starts out slowly, but it doesn't sputter and grind its wheels like they did. This is my favorite of the three.

F-bomb, no nudity, comical foreplay scene. Was that a 1993 Free Willy stuffed whale in this 1988 movie? Now that was really unexplained.",1320624000,,2478,4.411378555798687
4346951,5,B004EPZ02A,"Paranormal Activity 3 is the best addition to the PA series since the groundbreaking first film.  As my girlfriend shook while the credits rolled, I heard nearly everyone in the theater exclaim ""What a disappointment!"".  I guess we were watching a different film; opening with the unfortunate Katie and pregnant Christie, an ill fated man decides to take a gander at the Blair Witch sisters' odd childhood (recorded a bit improbably on a variety of VHS tapes from the 80's which did not exist at the time.)

As might be expected the two little girls had an unpleasant childhood.  No, no abuse, no missed meals, no glue sniffing, but something far more insidious and subtle ails the two lads. Christopher Nicolas Smith delivers a pretty good performance for a guy in a film which is videotaped with a homemade camera as does Lauren Bitner.  Daddy Dennis and Mommy Julie have got to be the unluckiest parents on earth if you forget about the whole Casey Anthony thing--anyway, without spoiling anything, we finally get to meet Grandma.  She sort of makes the film along with Toby.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity-2/dp/B003Q6D25K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity 2</a>&nbsp;was not a bad movie and by necessity developed the storyline from the original; this is the reflection it needed, packing the same threadless, ""What the Hell is Going On?"" terror of the first.  Should there be another film? If they stay at this level of quality, yes; if the directors get bogged down in money and start making unintentional parodies, no.  I have no doubt there will be as the fate of young Hunter is unknown.

Lesson learned pretty harshly by Dennis: get to know your in-laws before you marry.  A superb horror film.",1320537600,6,1781,5.23943661971831
