I searched ""Puss in Boots"" and bought the first thing that came up, thinking it was my grand kids favorite movie, but when we went to look at it, it was not the correct movie. My fault, I guess, but I didn't think they made multiple movies with the same name.",1462233600,,290,4.105263157894737
7845616,5,6303392385,"I am really torn on this one.  In context, this is a simply lovely short film from the early 1920's.
But when I saw this as a very young child (early 1960's), on black and white TV with poor reception it totally freaked me out.  Seriously, that it was silent, but there was station sound bleed and a creepy narrator -- TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.  Not even the Friday the 13th movies freak me out like this did.",1081987200,,404,4.220779220779221
