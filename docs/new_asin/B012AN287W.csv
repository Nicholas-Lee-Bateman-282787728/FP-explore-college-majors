8725761,2,B012AN287W,I watched the movie few weeks ago.  I will say the movie is slow.,1496880000,,65,3.642857142857143
8725762,3,B012AN287W,"Environment was great.  Premise was interesting.  Well shot, just lacked maturity.  Felt like the film knew it was low budget and played to the cliches on purpose.  Acting wasn't bad, and the film is enjoyable... just not much more than that.  I don't want to use the 8th grade teacher line... but it didn't fulfill it's true potential.",1484870400,,336,4.724137931034483
8725763,4,B012AN287W,Lots of suspense.  Decent acting,1480118400,,32,5.4
8725764,4,B012AN287W,Beautifully crafted and engaging from beginning to end. Directed by the uber talented Tj Scott and starring the gorgeous Victoria Pratt and Katrina Law. Who could ask for more.,1463184000,,176,5.103448275862069

8725767,2,B012AN287W,"The film opens by letting us know that Annie (Katrina Law) is going to be the only survivor, so much for plot spoilers. She just married Billy Rich (Lochlyn Munro) a Hollywood producer. They are traveling on a new back road in Death Valley traveling from LA to Vegas or maybe the other way around. They are in a classic car and are with another couple who we learn about on the fly.

In an odd accident, the car gets disabled by a partially dressed woman wielding a gun walking in the middle of the highway. They walk around the desert and of course die one by one until Annie is left alive...something we could have guessed from the first two minutes.

The film has a slight twist and at times attempts to look noir, but fails. The dead girl in the beginning wasn't very good at holding her breath and in one scene you can see her breathe. The acting wasn't half bad, it is just that it wasn't that interesting of a story. Nice car.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity",1445644800,2,966,4.26775956284153
8725768,1,B012AN287W,"Story is thin and predictable, acting is flat. Script makes no sense at times. Be prepared to suspend your disbelief... a lot.",1445558400,,126,4.7727272727272725
8725769,5,B012AN287W,"Part 1: Ordnarily I would say that I'm writing this review prematurely, but if there's one lock in episodic TV Direction it's the body of work of TJ Scott. I can't think of another of his contemporary Directors, (except for David Fincher in blockbusters,) that so consistently crafts such painterly composed visions on film, or gets such benchmark remarkable performances from his actors. Currently I anticipate TJ's Gothem episodes on Monday nights the way we used to make appointment TV before On Demand. And I've looked forward to this release even more avidly since he's working with all of his favorite colleagues! If you value perfection in Direction with special attention to composition and visual literacy, I recommend this and all other TJ Scott programs and media.

Part 2: Terrific characterizations that unfold exponentially in accord with the deepening and evolving plot. Gorgeous and desolate locations that match the isolation felt by the cast both as an ensemble and individually. Perfectly paced with cool crecendo. Loved it.",1445299200,4,1043,5.245508982035928
