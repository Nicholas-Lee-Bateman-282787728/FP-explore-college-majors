Perfect stories for boys and girls of all ages who still believe.  The characters are adaptations of Mr. London's creations, of course, but the essence remains.",1429315200,3,285,5.173913043478261
8206562,4,B000SSONGQ,"The good folks at Alpha Video have unearthed episodes from yet another hard-to-find television series, ""Captain David Grief.""  Filmed in Mexico and starring British actor Maxwell Reed (sporting a very passable American accent), the stories focused on the various adventures of Captain Grief and his crew in the South Seas. Regulars on the series were Tudor Owen, Mickey Simpson and Melvin Prestidge as Captain Grief's crew members.  Among the recognizable guest stars in the episodes are William Marshall, Bruce Gordon, and Mexican film star Claudio Brook, among a few others.  According to the Internet Movie Database, the series' 37 episodes look to have been produced entirely in 1957 (copyrights attributed to Guild Films on the episodes are all dated 1957), and then were broadcast during the 1957-58 and 1959-60 seasons in syndication.  The episodes included on this single disc include the following:

The Devils of Fautino
The Ghost of Tupapau
Eye of the Octopus
The Devil's Handmaiden

The episodes are not restored in any way, so those of you who are familiar with Alpha's line of vintage TV-on-DVD releases will know what to expect; for all others . . . . you have been warned.  The episodes are watchable enough, but the opening title sequence is a bit ragged looking and the two middle episodes on this DVD have no end credits.  ""Captain David Grief"" is certainly not a great series, but it's an enjoyable time passer that will appeal to fans of early action/adventure series.  Ordinarily, I'd rate a release like ""Captain David Grief"" three stars, but the rarity of the series earns it an extra star.",1190937600,8,1614,4.992537313432836
