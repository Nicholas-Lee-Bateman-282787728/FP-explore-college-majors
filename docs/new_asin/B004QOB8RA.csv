4449959,4,B004QOB8RA,"Over the years I've heard about Doctor Who. This was the 2nd time I had ever seen Dr. Who.  (The first was Dr. Who Christmas Carol).  I know it has quite the following, and it's a pretty good show, but I suppose since I have not seen more in the beginning, there are a few things I don't understand and it gets a tad strange for me sometimes. I probably won't get anymore. But it isn't too bad. As I said, perhaps if I had seen previous years shows it would make a bit more sense to me.  (I do enjoy things about time travel - I didn't realize that Dr. Who time travels through the entire universe.)",1392768000,,599,4.059322033898305
4449960,5,B004QOB8RA,I didn't like the fact that it had no tracking number. It (as you can imagine) made it difficult to track. I didn't know where it was coming from & kinda got a bit worried. But after e-mailing the seller he helped along the way. Although he didn't have the tracking number he assured me it would get to me soon. It came yesterday & I am very happy with it. I would definitely buy from this seller again. I just hope he uses tracking numbers in the future...I love the DVD. It's the 11th doctor's best season.,1391299200,2,508,4.1938775510204085

4449962,5,B004QOB8RA,"Really, sometimes (or most of the time) when I watch any of the Doctor's stories, I'm not sure what is going on more than half of the time.  But it's like a roller coaster ride.  Don't think about it--just strap yourself in and go with it.  Always fun, even if not always believable.  The Brits seem to always have the upper hand in entertaining us.  Can't beat any of these DVDs.  I suggest you buy all of the ones available for a fun ride.",1390521600,,441,4.190476190476191

4449974,5,B004QOB8RA,"I'm a Doctor who fan is all you need to know.

It has some very good episodes in it. I recommend it",1360454400,,99,3.5
4449975,5,B004QOB8RA,"Series Six of Doctor Who seemed to be all filler because of the way the season started.  The Doctor's destiny at Lake Silencio--which we knew within the first 15 minutes of the season--seemed to turn the whole of the season into just waiting to see how The Eleventh Iteration of the TimeLord got out of this ultimate fixed point in time.  Which sort of rendered all other issues within the season...well, moot.  Even the Big Reveal of the first half of the season--that River Song is Melody Pond, the daughter of Amy Pond and Rory Williams--seemed minor.  That is, until one remembers that in this continuity, it is the Tenth Doctor who loses River--so the ""out"" becomes reasonable.
Such seems the nature of this set, and it almost makes one want to watch ""The Wedding Of River Song""--the last episode of the season--FIRST.  But one cannot.  ""Let's Kill Hitler"" explains the evolvement of Melody Pond into River, and introduces us to the Tesselecta, the humanoid shape-shifting robots that contain miniaturized human crews.  ""Night Terrors"" and ""The Girl Who Waited"" are both looks into the three-person dynamic of The Doctor, Amy and Rory; with ""The Girl..."" being a revealing look at the depth and length of Amy's feelings for Rory (Also, sort of portending the first part of Series Seven...).  ""The God Complex"" ultimately reveals how much Eleven really cares for both Amy and Rory; pushing them away and back into ""normal"" life at the end of the episode.  ""Closing Time"" is fun; bringing back James Corden as Craig Owens (From Series 5's ""The Visitor"") along with a visit from The Cybermen.
Which brings us to ""The Wedding Of River Song"", one of those wild, season-ending mismashes we've gotten used to in the Davies/Moffatt Era of Doctor Who; where time seems dyfunctional (In this case, occuring all at once) due to the Doctor NOT being killed at Lake Silencio.  Again, this is an episode that ties up another longstanding question--in this case, it's the question of why River Song was in interplanetary prison (Murder) and who she murdered--as it turns out, The Doctor.
In the era of The Eleventh Doctor, we have gotten used to the crowded TARDIS.  Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Arthur Darvill...they make this work.  If we look at The Doctor and Amy through the eyes of the ""traditional"" relationship between The Doctor and his Companion...well, we can't.  Eleven sees Amy and Rory as a unit, so in that way Moffatt writes Smith clearly not as romantic as Davies made Tennant (or Chris Eccelston) with Billie Piper.  This is where the magical work of Alex Kingston comes into play.  From the introduction of River in ""Silence In The Library"", Kingston has always been able to give an extra page to River's story in every appearance with the page being perfectly...sensible.  Plus, her appeal--both on the eyes and in character to Smith--comes across magnificently.
Overall, the back half of Series Six seemed for the most part to be a set of one-offs in preparation for the Season Finale...and setting up the first part of Series Seven.  The flow of the season seems disrupted in getting the Series in two parts...but it does not take away from the enjoyment of watching Matt, Karen, Arthur and Alex in this whole set.
Highly Recommended.",1360022400,,3247,4.853260869565218

4449977,5,B004QOB8RA,Matt Smith the 11th. Doctor continues to just get better and better. As do the plots and Russell Davis's writing. Never a bad episode. And if you love the Ponds bring a hanky. Also you will meet the woman destained to replace Amy & Rory. At a later date. Like Christmas. And finally prepare for the return on the Doctor's most creepy and dangerous foes. The Weeping Angels. In new York of all places!,1358899200,,400,4.418918918918919

4449989,5,B004QOB8RA,"Shortly after becoming a Whovian, I saw this in a store for $10.  It was such a deal, I couldn't resist buying it.  And of course I couldn't resist watching it.

When I watched Let's Kill Hitler, I was immediately captivated by Matt Smith's performance, even though all the continuity references confused me.  It was a good episode, just bewildering to a new-comer.  But after that awkward first episode, I was hooked for the rest of the set.  The remaining episodes are all classics.  Night Terrors is one of the scariest episodes in the whole franchise; The Girl Who Waited is a beautifully done episode that had me wanting to tear up; The God Complex is another creepy one with a very interesting monster of the wee;, Closing Time is funny & introduced me to the Cybermen, possibly my favorite Doctor Who villains; and the Wedding of River Song is just an awesome finale that is probably the most suspenseful episode in the history of the franchise.  I ordered the 5th season as soon as I finished watching this, it was that good.  Matt Smith is the best Doctor apart from Tom Baker.",1358294400,2,1086,4.585492227979275

4449996,5,B004QOB8RA,Being a fan of Dr. Who since the 60s I have nearly fallen in love with the whole concept. Sometimes you must suspend common sense and just let go but especially this sixth series. The Doctor is becoming more and more human as time goes on. I have never been disappointed even with the early black and white stories.,1334016000,,315,4.3559322033898304
4449997,5,B004QOB8RA,"Not only is this the greatest sci-fi show on television. But I think this is the best season. We finally learn more about my favorite character, River Song an her complicated history with the Doctor.

I personally am too impatient to wait for the entire season (the call each season a ""series"" in the UK unlike here in the US)to come out on DVD so I did buy The Sixth Series in both parts, but at this point it might be worth just buying the whole season at once.",1332374400,4,463,4.202247191011236

4450041,2,B004QOB8RA,"I am an avid Dr. Who fan. I usually do not write reviews of anything but I really need to air out my disappointment in this set. Matt Smith is great as the Doctor, I will not take that away from him. He is not the problem the writing is. The only bright point is of course the last episode with the Silence.
""The Girl Who Waited"" is the absolute worst episode I have ever seen, ""The Space Museum"" had that title now well this episode does. I think that ruined the whole experience for me. The River Song arc was inventive.
The Cybermen episode was just boring-These are one of Dr. Who's most hated and evil villains! They deserve so much more respect...Shame on the writers! (You know who you are!!!)
I will not bore you anymore. Please think twice about purchasing this. See it on TV or just download to your wireless device.

The Girl Who Waited is literally painful to watch!  While there are some interesting convoluted plot lines in River Songs character, I have been sorry to see her turned into something that resembles a cartoon character.  Think back to her first appearance in Season 4 with David Tennant in the Silence of the Library.  It was so well done--fascinating and portrayed as a character with a lot of interest and class.  What happened?  The whole overall tone has changed.  It seems like in almost every episode the whole gist is that the Doctor ""will die"".

I am a long time Dr. Who fan so I may be biased but I feel Matt Smith really has nailed down the Doctor and has made it his own. Season 6 really sees him making the doctor a different doctor than season 5 where it seemed he was just tweeking David Tennants Doctor.
