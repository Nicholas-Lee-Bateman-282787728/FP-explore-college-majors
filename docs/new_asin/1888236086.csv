7800924,1,1888236086,"Content: Although the first five minutes are spent with his wife giving an overview of his art projects, Mr. Booth does not list any accreditations after his name. The next five lecture minutes are filled with ahs, ums, ers, and hesitations. Then five minutes are spent tediously masking out sections of a picture.  When he finally starts to paint, it's with a dirty brush. During the time he is painting he states what not to do, then goes ahead and does it. While removing the masking with his fingers (there are removers made for this), he smears the masked area with paint from his picture. The rest of the video is edited to show end stage results only.
Quality: This is NOT a state of the art production, even though it is only from 1994. The VHS operator who used the video cameras must not have calibrated the color or the focus before using them. Not only is there a distinct lack of color on the tape, but what little color there is, is a soft focus glow. It appears this production was based on two uncalibrated cameras, a strict time slot with no time planned for retakes to correct mistakes, a first-time editing job and low quality mass tape copiers, as my VHS player was constantly trying to correct the tracking.",1043884800,11,1228,4.531531531531532
7800925,1,1888236086,"I'm so disappointed in this video. A very long introduction by an inexperienced announcer tries to show the art he is famous for. Unfortunately, you can hardly see it as the camera fades in and out,  pictures blur and the color - oh, the color is simply atrocious. This looks  like a third generation copy. I should have known when they spelled the  title of the video wrong in the introduction that it was only going to get  worse. And yes, it continued along the same vein. It didn't matter if he  used red, orange, or brown - it all looked like blue/black. Instead of an  earth tone, it appeared lime green on the screen. He was obviously  uncomfortable in front of the camera - there was a lot of wasted time on  both vocal hesitations as well as trivial pitter-patter that only a  kindergartner might need to know. I'm shocked that he would put his fine  reputation at stake and allow a video of such poor quality to be released.  Save your money, buy a book, buy anything else, but don't buy this video!",963273600,11,1009,4.4
