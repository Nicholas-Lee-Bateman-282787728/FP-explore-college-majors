8568647,5,B00BHO10TI,Great video for those who love to practice yoga at any level. Instructor guides you through breathing and poses and provides modifications to help you customize your practice to your desired level of intensity. I attend regular classes at a local studio but have found this video to be an excellent motivator for the days I can't make it to a class. I have also shared it with friends who are new to yoga and want to familiarize themselves with a basic practice before going to a studio class. Instructor is very knowledgeable. I previously purchased her video Any Chair Yoga for my mother who has had double hip replacements. I really like the way she provides modifications that help people with injuries or limitations get the full benefit of a yoga practice.,1400544000,,762,4.7368421052631575
8568648,5,B00BHO10TI,"""Yoga Fundamentals"" gives the fundamentals required in any yoga class and helps to individualize your practice. It  can be used to supplement the teacher's instruction and to prevent injuries, by suggesting modifications. The guidance is very detailed and clear. The program is slow paced, to make the poses and transitions easy to comprehend and follow.

I recommend the video preview on YouTube (""Yoga Fundamentals DVD Preview"") to appreciate the quality and level of detail of the instruction, especially for the modified practice. I could not find this level of detail in any other yoga DVD. For anyone like me, needing modifications to their practice, there are separate modules, with clear, easy, and practical suggestions.

""Yoga Fundamentals"" is also very versatile. One can use it for a regular yoga practice with, or without, props. Or it can be used for a shorter yet a bit more intense practice, by playing repeatedly the ""Sun Salutations"" section. Also, you can use the guided relaxation part, to relax and refresh your body and spirit.

I most highly recommend this for anyone wanting a great customized practice, always at your DVD disposal!",1366243200,3,1156,5.165775401069519
