8094319,5,B000BYOH7C,I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is interested in the paranormal. It was great from beginning to end.,1231891200,,110,4.55
8094320,4,B000BYOH7C,"I'm not sure it was a ghost attacking or not, but it was really funny.  The investigators are total characters, and I get the feeling they actually are that strange, not just putting it on.  Either way, they are funny.  My boyfriend and I started calling the two main ones Mutt and Jeff because of the massive size difference.  Combine that with their outfits, it was very entertaining.

The ghost attack seemed authentic, especially because I really believed no one new what was going one, what had happened.  The girls that felt the presense seemed to really believe something had just assaulted them, and some sort of wierd pulsing orb was got on the IR video, so it could be a ghost.  The location was definately different and really cool, you will recognize a lot of the stuff from Young Guns, etc.

The way they investigate the ghost was interesting.  They were actually skeptical, instead of coming on the scene convinced.  What ended up happening was strange and definately different.  But like all things regarding paranormal, and believing is a type of faith, it is really hard to get something definative.

They seemed to come as close as it gets though.

Whatever it is, it is funny and I wouldn't mind getting to know these people in real life.",1146614400,2,1257,4.684931506849315
8094321,2,B000BYOH7C,"The DVD was mildly amusing.  It showed no paranormal activity to me.  The ""Ghost Hunters"" said they were scientific but I find it hard to believe when their office is filled with New Age crap.  They try to crack jokes and be funny but they seemed to try and let the guard down of the viewer and/or skeptic.  They made a comment that as soon as they get the equipment set up, the ghost would hide.  Apparently it did.  The girls seemed to scream on cue when the ""Ghost Hunters"" walked down to the door ready to save them.  The ""paranormal"" thing caught on tape appeared to be a bat with it's flapping wings.  Either side of the object had movement like wings.  The picture quality was poor with a lot of off tripod jumpy shots.  About all I could say is that I got a good laugh.",1143849600,5,777,4.1891891891891895
8094322,5,B000BYOH7C,"This was one of the strangest yet really interesting pieces I have seen on the paranormal.  It follows these two goofily funny, trenchcoat wearing, smart and really scientific ghost hunters and their team as they check out this creepy old theater.  While in there, I have never heard screems quite like the ones emenating from the girls.  And poor girls at that.  This ghost supposedly only confronts women, so they stick three of the most totally unprepared for anything to happen women you could find in there and when it happens (whatever it is) they scream so loud.  And the hot English one moans and screams!  If it wasn't so cute and funny, I'd feel really bad for her.  The lead ghost hunters (skeptics to the core), even make them do it again!  Then they have guys dress up in drag to see if they can fool the ghost!  This is hillarious!  You gotta check it out.",1133136000,2,870,4.484076433121019
8094323,5,B000BYOH7C,"TV Shows and documentaries aren't hard to come by these days. The market is literally flooded with programs showcasing the paranormal. The vast majority of these programs, however, are lacking one thing.......realism!!!

Ghost Hunter X is what it is, real life ghost hunters exploring the realms of the paranormal from a skeptical, scientific, and real angle! No fluffy psychics, only real, substantial evidence from the best in the business! The Southwest Ghost Hunter's, with their array of colorful investigators, shed new light on ghostly phenomena in a way that is never seen. With an arsenal of cameras and electromagnetic field detectors, they show why Old Tucson Studios is one of the Southwest's most haunted locations.

Beautifully shot, this documentary film about things that go bump in the night has something for everyone!

I can't wait for the next one!!!",1132012800,4,870,5.244604316546763
8094324,4,B000BYOH7C,"The heck with ghosts, this thing is more about people watching than anything else.  The two lead investigators are hillarious as they wonder around taking reading chatting about everything from science to bat droppings looking a bit like ectoplasm.  It is really funny.

The whole ghost part of this really takes everyone by surprise.  They aren't expecting anything to happen and when it does in such a big way, the truly terrified and spooked reactions are something else.  And that ghostly image the camerman got by accident is FREAKY!

All in all it is a hillarious time spent with these humorous crumudgens.",1131926400,5,612,4.950980392156863
8094325,5,B000BYOH7C,"Usually ghost hunting shows are fake feeling and full of questionable psychics and seers.  This entire program is from a skeptics viewpoint and that makes it really creepy because even operating as skeptics, they really get something.  And my goodness, can those women screem when they are attacked.  The fear they instantly generate is hillarious.

And it is funny.  The big and the skinny investigator are just hillarious and seem to really know what they are talking about.

But I have to say, that cute screaming English lady is my favorite.  She gets so scared she actually moans to go home and stop the experiement.",1131148800,9,621,4.857142857142857
