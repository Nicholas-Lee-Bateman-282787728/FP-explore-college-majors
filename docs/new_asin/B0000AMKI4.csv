7997715,1,B0000AMKI4,It has you believing that Jet Li is in this movie and he isn't.  It is extremely stupid remakes of real movies.  I really wasted my money and will never by another movie by these guys again,1241827200,,189,4.081081081081081
7997716,3,B0000AMKI4,"I actually bought this because I went to highschool with one of the directors (I haven't kept in touch with them, but I thought I would check it out).  The action scenes in most of the shorts are really great, the stuntwork is amazing, and the production values are suprisingly decent.
I think the main shortcoming is the short-film format.  Without any sort of development of the characters, there's no real reason to be interested in the action.
  Action without a story just sort of becomes monotonous. I'd be a lot more engaged in the action if I were playing Soul Caliber II. If you're really into fighting, then maybe it wouldn't be as boring to you as it was for me.",1185148800,,673,4.491803278688525
7997717,5,B0000AMKI4,"Many short films are showcased via film festivals and the internet.  MOST of those shorts are dramatic in nature.  The shorts in this DVD are a rarity in the short film world as they are heavy in action which are not as easy to produce as the dramatic ones.
With the increasing popularity of martial arts action movies, Everyone Is Kung-Fu Fighting is an exceptional DVD showcasing some of the best martial arts action that rival and/or surpass most of the studio released action movies.
Some of the directors are destined for Hollywood.",1082332800,,537,4.763440860215054
7997718,4,B0000AMKI4,"For fans of martial arts and low budget films, A55 films delivers a full featured action packed dvd with 9 short films from various directors. Particularily interesting is the stringing together of the movies to make one long film, breaking them up into chapters.
