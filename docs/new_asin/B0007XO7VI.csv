8053573,5,B0007XO7VI,"The numerous videos in ""African Masks"" are all great on their own, but are even better when seen together. This film allows viewers to see masked performances in Burkina Faso from three different decades, and provides a great source of comparison. I especially like the fact that it generates discussion regarding change and continuity in African art, and highlights the diversity among different cultures. While the historical footage is fascinating, I really like the contemporary videos from various masking festivals in Burkina Faso. I would recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in the arts of Africa, especially because it captures important aspects that are normally overlooked in a museum setting, such as movement, music, and community participation.",1210204800,4,771,5.433333333333334
