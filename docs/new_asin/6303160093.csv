James Earl Jones is superb as Vernon Johns, full of the essence of the word ""love.""  Love is a verb, meaning to take action, not a feeling or some image of lust.  Watch the movie with a friend, family member or someone who cares, and then go out and do something about it.  Don't get excited about the movie and then do nothing about it.  And don't think you are just one person and you will have no effect.  Vernon Johns was one person and he paved the way for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other civil rights activists.  Pave the way for a better community, county, state, nation and world.  Thank you.",987292800,36,854,4.260869565217392

587198,5,6303160093,"This goes beyond the archetypal view of History where one man or woman seem to be directly responsible for huge changes or developments in human consciousness.  James Earl Jones shows a character with flaws, frustrations, and personal failures, but a character that still manages to lay a foundation for change - even as his story is somehow swept under the rug and largely forgotten.  All of our heroes had feet of clay, and were supported by thousands of dedicated individuals.  They were often shunned and sabotaged by the communities that should have been the staunchest supporters as well.  This story brings out that deeper meaning and truth!",1388016000,2,648,5.02803738317757

The civil rights struggle was long and hard and even today, we can still see evidence that some parts of it still exist. The Vernon Johns story shows where we started from and is told masterfully through the acting of James Earl Jones.

587269,5,6303160093,"James Earl Jones portrays Vernon Johns, a Baptist preacher in Montgomery, Alabama, in the late 1940s. He's smart, he's a terrific orator, and he knows how to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. In fact, the members of his congregation are entirely too comfortable, willing to accept Jim Crow laws and injustices of all kinds.

He does his best to stir them to care about their own rights and self-respect, but to little avail. The one member who becomes convinced, a deacon who is also the local football coach, is the only holdout when the board of deacons wants to get rid of Dr. Johns. When he is killed by a policeman for interfering in their beating of a young black man, the board had a unanimous vote.

They decided they needed a new preacher, at least as intelligent, but more dignified and conventional than Dr. Johns. Go ahead; guess who they got. Clue: the church is named the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.",1336694400,,932,4.676829268292683
587270,5,6303160093,"This was an excellent movie, and just in time for Black History Month. Vernon Johns was someone I never heard about in school, but I saw the movie when it was televised years ago. Vernon Johns set the stage for Martin Luther King, Jr. I thought about it recently and wanted my 15 year old daughter to see it and decided to order it. Excellent movie, my only complaint is with the couple of times they used God's name in vain. Fortunately for me I own a dvd player that mutes out foul language.",1328400000,,493,4.25531914893617
587271,5,6303160093,"Vernon Jones is the epitome of a strong Black man who, along with his family, suffered tragically in the struggle for Black and human freedom. The VERNON JOHNS STORY powerfully depicts this brave and bold, little know crusader who stood up for Black people, got knocked down by white racism, but rose even more determined - his dignity and manhood intact. James Earl Johns's emits proud fierceness in his portrayal of Vernon Johns, further cementing his well deserved renown as a great actor. The movie made me ponder whether I could have been as strong as Vernon Johns was to endure the literal terrorist actions Black people suffered at the hands of white racists, especially the then all-white Montgomery, Alabama police department and judicial system.  Thanks Brother Vernon Johns for risking your life and liberty while smashing at the barriers of racism, helping to create a better future for me, my children and millions of others.",1315785600,,938,5.012820512820513
587272,5,6303160093,"Vernon Johnson set the groundwork for what would become the Civil Rights Movement!  In this story we see how the seeds were sown and what the country was like.

587273,5,6303160093,"The Vernon Johns Story is one that should be shown to all Americans.  Vernon Johns (James Earl Jones) is a pastor who traveled to churches in the south, preaching until 1948 when he was hired by Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery Alabama.  As near as I can tell, the movie remains historical fiction in that details, specific people and events may have been added, but the story itself and the message as well as the general plot are historically accurate.  The racial prejudices come clear in the movie, and they are as I remember them in the late 50's and 60's.  The movie deals very will and carefully with the characters, emotions, and 'both' sides of the racial issues.  People are as they are, as they've been 'raised/socialized' whether Black, white, indian, asian etc.  All the characters portrayed in the movie are carefully developed and the supporting cast each performed admirably.  This is one of those movies that pull you into the story, make you think, see the injustice, wrongs, and social atmosphere.  The movie isn't preachy or 'pushing' one side or the other and that's one reason I love to watch it over and over again.  It makes the viewer want to 'do something' to correct a wrong, or fight a fight.  Vernon Johns (in the movie and in real life) began the Civil Rights movement.  He is unheralded for the most part because he was replaced as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church by a very young new pastor named Dr. Martin Luther King,Jr. by the Black 'Elders/Deacons' of the Church (the same ones who hired him) because of the 'waves' he made trying to equalize the racism so prevalent at the time.  The Vernon Johns Story should be required reading/viewing in ALL schools across the U.S.  We've made huge strides in creating 'equality' across races in the U.S. but some racism and certainly other social issues still exist that need to be addressed.  This movie is one of my favorite movies and it's definitely worth buying to be able to view again and again.",1291161600,,1998,4.687679083094556

The interesting thing about this movie was that the story was taken from a preacher point of view. So there's many moral issue that we can get. It's a great movie because it told us the predecessor of M.L. King. How different the character, how provoking the sermons, etc. It's simply a great movie.

Much of this story is seen through the eyes of his daughter as she comes to appreciate her often absent, often embarrassing and always stubborn father. He teaches truth to his congregation, to his community and to his daughter.

A true prophet. A John the Baptist, if you wil, preparing the way for Martin Luther King. But, why was Vernon Johns rejected. Perhaps he spoke too strongly. James Earl Jones portrays him gloriously. A titan who will not bend, who demands attention even if you will not give him the respect he deserves. This story should be taught to our children until they can recite it like a litany.
