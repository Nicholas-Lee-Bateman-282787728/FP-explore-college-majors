It's a nice group of kids, no really mean tricks and the acting is naturalistic, not phony. Lots of outdoor fun, humor, and just nice times with six kids and a dog and toddler. Another nice thing is the kids are similar in ages, but not all one age, which would be another phony problem. Finally, it is interesting to see everyday life and times on a Swedish farm in the late 1920's.
Some technical notes: I first saw this Swedish movie when it originally came out, with English subtitles (Bullerby Boken I think it was called). This video instead has very well dubbed English speakers. I believe they split the original movie into two video cassettes and obviously this is one of them. There is not the usual sequel problem of all the kids being noticably older and there were several stories that were not in the first video but are here. The split is well done. It feels like two different but very similar movies. (This video takes the kids through the school year while the first video takes us through a summer.) The box says the time is ""the early 1940's,"" but that is wrong. When the the new year comes in, the kids say it is 1929 and the clothes they wear for special occasions clearly matches that era.",1028419200,7,1333,4.467213114754099

Taking up right where The Children of Noisy Village left off, we find our cast heading off to school and lots of vignettes about it as well as of holidays, a blizzard and a first try at babysitting. If you liked the first one, this is bound to be hit.",973814400,4,456,4.858974358974359
