6296890,5,B00ITE4XUM,"Run don't walk and buy this if you love classic animation.  It has been given loving care.  We get the full frame including curved corners.  Beautiful transfer!  The print is beautiful -- not without a scratch here or there, but at this age I prefer this over what Disney does by completely destroying the original by digital manipulation.  Healthy grain is here. We also get a huge amount of extras including HD classic Fleischer cartoons!  Grab it while you can.  The other version has been cropped on the top and bottom.",1395619200,3,523,4.681318681318682
6296891,5,B00ITE4XUM,"This is a joy to behold. You can really see the detail in the beautiful watercolor backgrounds. The color is the best I've ever seen of this cartoon. The characters are hand drawn and they use rotoscope for Gulliver,giving him a very ""human""look. This was done in Disney's ""Snow White"" with Snow white and the Prince. The Dwarfs were hand drawn. THIS IS THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANIMATION!
No computers or phony effects. ALL ART WAS DONE BY HUMANS!!! Children of today should be treated to this great Cartoon. And
Folks of all ages will enjoy the heartfelt anti-war cartoon ""Gulliver's Travels"".",1395619200,,588,4.7745098039215685
6296892,5,B00ITE4XUM,"This is one of the best transfers of an animated film I have seen. The colors are incredible, the picture is sharp, but it doesn't have that digital scrubbed look that so many do. It looks like actual film! The sound is very clear and bold. Everything about this film is a winner. Just the Gulliver transfer is well worth the cost of the disc, but you also get eight other beautiful classic cartoons spanning the history of the Fleischer studio. Get this disc and recommended it to anyone you know who is a fan of fine animation.

Great job Thunderbean!",1395273600,5,553,4.475247524752476
6296893,5,B00ITE4XUM,"I pre-ordered this (along with many other Thunderbean fans) quite some time ago and it has been a loooooong wait but after it arrived I am very satisfied.  I expected only a BD but there is also a DVD in the package.  Since others have gone into the plot and particulars of the film and extras I will only say that the restoration is the best I have seen this film looking in all the years and many different copies I purchased.  Thunderbean did themselves proud with finding good elements and producing a BD that shows off the great color, animation and sound used in this film.  It finally looks and sounds REALLY good and I am so happy I did order it.  WELL DONE Thunderbean.",1395187200,4,678,4.349206349206349
6296894,5,B00ITE4XUM,"Thunderbeam has searched the world for quality 35mm I.B. Technicolor film prints for this transfer.  Their hard work was worth it.
In a few brief shots a 16mm Agfa-Color print was used to replace missing footage. The transfer of the 16mm image is so great that I dare you to find the scenes (they last less than a minute each).
The image transfer is sharp and stable with great colors.
The audio is crisp & clear.
While image stabilization was used, no DNR was used and you will still see the very occasional brief scratch.

I used to think the old Winstar DVD restoration was the best, but viewing it again today I fand that DVD soft with analogue tape noise in the blacks.  This new Blu-ray surpasses that old DVD form a decade ago.

Thunderbeam has also searched various collections and libraries for rare promotional material, radio shows, phonograph records, and toys from 1940.  We get treated to a bonus section like no other on this title!  Only complaint: The audio files are not time-coded so you have to listen to the entire audio file in one sitting, no pause of fast forwarding.

A good selection of cartoon shorts from the various Max Fleischer cartoons are included, starting with a silent Koko The Clown cartoon mastered from a vintage Kodascope film print.  The only disappointment in these cartoons is the Betty Boop print of ""IS MY PALM RED"".  There are better copies of that cartoon on other Betty Boop DVDs, this copy is soft and a little washed out.

While this GULLIVER'S TRAVELS Blu-ray doesn't equal the quality of a modern film on Blu-ray, it is the nicest it has ever been.  One complaint I might make about the transfer is that I remember seeing deeper blacks in the night scenes when I saw a I.B. Technicolor print at the theaters.  Here the night scenes are a deep blue.

There is a strange GREEN SPOT on the center of the very far left side at the 30 minute mark that lasts for about 3 1/2 minutes.  This appears to be a printing flaw in the 35mm master film.
At the 40 minute mark some ""pops"" and ""clicks"" can be heard briefly in the soundtrack.

Disclaimer:  While I have no financial interest in this release, I was involved in the restoration work.",1395014400,6,2183,4.530612244897959
6296895,5,B00ITE4XUM,"The movie looks great for it's age and has some wonderful bonus features. It's nice to see the care taken with all that they put in this release and has made it worth the wait for me. In my opinion this is how films should be restored with a bit of their age left in. I am sad to see a lot of the older cartoons I grew up with softened and filled in with color blotting out the original lines of the artwork to make it seem closer to todays art style.

I had honestly forgotten how little this was about Gulliver or the prince and princess. I have to wonder if they were just styled that way to show to the studio that they could compete with Snow White. The rest of the characters were styled in the classic fashion and displayed a larger range of emotions. Gabby and the three spies really carry the movie with the kings adding bluster and additional comic relief.

I had never seen The Little Dutch Mill before this and was really blown away by the artwork. The short Modeling was also another first for me and assures that this will definitely get some extra viewing in the years to come.",1394323200,11,1092,4.220095693779904
6296896,5,B00ITE4XUM,"I first saw Gulliver's Travels as a boy when it was reissued for Saturday matinees in the mid-fifties. Over the years I've bought numerous VHS and DVD copies of the film, and was always disappointed. Not this time! Thunderbean found a beautiful Technicolor print of Gulliver's Travels from the 1950s reissue and has carefully, lovingly, transferred it to Blu-Ray and DVD. This is not a full digital restoration, which would be prohibitively expensive. The very few and extremely minor flaws in the print remind us that this is a work of art that was created on film, not video, and has been rescued from oblivion by people who really care about film animation.

As for the movie itself, it is more about Gabby than Gulliver, who may have even less screen time than the two squabbling kings. As a boy I thought Princess Glory and Prince David were insipid characters, and they seem just as forgettable now. King Little and King Bombo, the three spies (Sneak, Snoop, and Snitch), and Gabby are all good comedy characters who give the movie it's fun factor. The songs are mostly very likable, especially ""It's a Hap-Hap-Happy Day!"", which I think was used in many Fleischer cartoons in the years following Gulliver.

The disc is packed with extras. There are eight Fleischer cartoons, in both color and black and white. While none look as spectacular as Gulliver's Travels, all are in good to excellent condition and very watchable. My two favorites were 'In My Merry Oldsmobile"", a bouncing ball sing-a-long that was funny and inventive, and ""Little Dutch Mill"" which is in two color Technicolor, and makes the most extensive use of the Fleisher's patented Stereoptical process that I can remember seeing in any of their cartoons. There are also galleries of production art, movie tie-in merchandise, posters, radio shows, song recordings and other treasures, and a 12 page booklet with many interesting notes about the film and the Fleischer studios. Someone has been a big fan and Gulliver collector for a long time!

All in all an excellent package, well worth the long wait since my pre-release purchase last fall.",1394236800,32,2116,4.921568627450981
6296897,5,B00ITE4XUM,"This 1939 classic feature film cartoon is still widely reproduced and you can read plenty of reviews of the film online, so I will focus on the technical details of this 2014 Thunderbean Blu-ray/DVD release. I received this in the mail yesterday and have watched most of the content, but I probably do not have as discerning an eye as others, nor have I ever written professional Blu-ray reviews. As a final introductory note, the DVD and Blu-ray contents are virtually identical (other than the higher quality of the latter); I will note a couple of differences in the extra features. Steve Stanchfield, chief archivist on the project, has written a detailed review of the restoration and embedded (through his YouTube account) a 2-minute sample of 1080-quality video highlighting each title on this release. You can find it on the Cartoon Research website: ""Gulliver"" Comes To BluRay.

VIDEO: With a few minor exceptions, the visual quality of the feature and shorts on this disc are excellent. I am accustomed to Kino and Criterion Blu-ray releases of films from the first half of the 20th century; the high quality of this Thunderbean release deserves to be compared to both of these larger companies. The only obvious problem I noticed was a small green blotch on the left edge of the screen for about three minutes, starting at the 30-minute mark. The 8 shorts are of varying quality, but they were not cleaned up as well as the Gulliver feature.

AUDIO: Most likely as good as these releases will ever sound. I don't know if any noise-reduction editing was done, but there is minimal hiss and all the content on these discs sound about average for most films I've seen restored from this era. I noticed at least twice a shift in the sound for a few seconds (one at 40:17). I assume this is probably a transition between film reels; the video is consistent, but there are significant blips in the sound.

EXTRAS: There are at least two hours of extra video and audio material on this disc. It is a wealth of Fleischer content. My only (very minor) complaint is the reduced navigational ability of the Blu-ray compared to the DVD on the audio content. I could not fast-forward through the Decca audio content, and some of the image galleries required the use of the Play button instead of the track-advance button.

SUMMARY: This is the first Blu-ray release from Thunderbean and it is clearly a labor of love. The video and audio restoration of Gulliver in particular are the best these releases have ever been on home video, and the wealth of extras alone make this an invaluable set of discs to add to your collection",1394150400,27,3881,4.7835820895522385
6296898,5,B00ITE4XUM,"This wonderful Fleischer classic from 1939 has been given a loving restoration by the Thunderbean company.  I remember the film from my youth growing up in the mid 50's and early 60's.  Considering the numerous lousy public domain versions that have been released on video over the years, I never expected to see this film again in such great condition.  My grandkids already love it!  The colors are vibrant and the film has been meticulously cleaned up.  It's presented in its original aspect ratio so you get the full image... none of that cropping to produce a fake widescreen movie.  No disturbing digital noise reduction appears to have been used in the restoration which would tend to destroy fine detail and film grain.  The image is very natural and film like.  I love it!  Thank you Thunderbean.  This is my first purchase of one of their products and it looks like I will become a regular customer.  The package contains both a Blu-ray and a DVD copy with identical material.  Lots of great bonus material is also included.  If you love classic animation, take a break from Disney and buy this for yourself or family.",1394064000,18,1128,4.723076923076923
6296899,5,B00ITE4XUM,It arrived quickly and that is a very good thing!  Looking forward to watching it.  Haven't had a chance yet.  Smile.,1432425600,,117,4.476190476190476
6296900,5,B00ITE4XUM,Absolutely Great upgrade from previous  editions.  Much improved color and clarity.  Considering the original negatives are no longer available this is surely a great accomplishment.,1430870400,,182,6.2
6296901,5,B00ITE4XUM,"The Max Fleischer 1939 animated feature, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, has been denied proper appraisal for decades. This was largely because it fell into public domain and prints of inferior quality flooded the home video market. Happily, this is no longer the case with this gorgeously restored Blu-ray/DVD Combo Edition from Thunderbean Animation.

GULLIVER'S TRAVELS was the second full-color animated feature - Walt Disney's 1937 SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was the first - and it became one of the top ten most successful films of 1940. Utilizing the rotoscoping process, the animation of Gulliver is smooth and delicately nuanced, and its realism blends well with the more whimsical gesturing of the Lilliputians. The marvelous lighting effects add mood to the scenes, especially when Gulliver is discovered washed ashore. The scene of the tiny townfolk banding together to harness the unconscious giant is a tour de force of organic drawing and technical expertise seldom matched in animated films.

Directed by Dave Fleischer, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a wonderfully engaging adaptation of the famous Jonathan Swift satirical tale, and features a beautiful music score by Victor Young with songs by Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin.

The sources used for this new transfer included the finest 35mm and 16mm elements, resulting in the best possible version we can ever expect to see. The original mono audio track contains some glitches which betray its age, however it's nothing that detracts from enjoying the film.

Along with GULLIVER, this edition contains eight vintage Fleischer cartoons and a generous amount of bonus material including the complete Decca record album, a pencil test, original production art, publicity material, and the original trailer, just to list a few.

Thunderbean is to be applauded for finally making this timeless classic available in such beautiful condition, and I give it my highest recommendation.",1430784000,3,1929,5.374172185430464

I made the big mistake of thinking that ALL of the dvds  and Blu Rays out there are just going to be the same ole blurry/mushy public domain stock like all the others. Well, PLEASE do not make that mistake. There is this wonderful man named Steve Stanchfield that owns this company and has been restoring the best animation besides WB Golden Collection. We are talking out of his OWN POCKET! Yes, he has been collecting and trading and searching the world over for prints, negs, 16, 35 and everything else in order to scan these Van Beruen, Fleischer, Bray, you name it, in HD! Sometimes off of the original NEG! Then he removes damage, color corrects, grades, fixes sound issues, and puts cartoons that are WAY MORE important than whats seen on adult swim theses days into High Definition! Let me tell you something, when you turn off the lights, sit back, and GT BLASTS OFF THE SCREEN it will make you cry. Yes, the work Steve has put into this and other releases is truly an outstanding achievement in archival restoration. The Painless Window Washer and some of the other cartoon treats also kick major ass in HD. You still get that beautiful film grain, NO Digital Noise Removal here to ruin the color definition! Get this, NOW! If saving the great animation of the early 1900s is important to you and your friends, please help Steve do this by purchasing his wonderful products.",1427932800,7,1500,4.5762081784386615
6296904,5,B00ITE4XUM,"I cannot believe how good this movie looks. My animation teacher in college showed me this movie on a VHS tape around 11 years ago and the quality was horrible.

Seeing this movie on blu-ray is astonishing and as if I am seeing it for the first time ever. Sharp images and excellent color. Incredibly impressive transfer for being done independently and on a low budget.

6296907,5,B00ITE4XUM,Easily the best presentation to date of a neglected classic!,1412640000,,60,5.1
6296908,4,B00ITE4XUM,"This classic animated film from the same era as Disney's ""Pinnoccio"" has never looked better. There is a previous bluray release, but it actually looks pretty darned awful! That version appears to have been made from the same laserdisc master (not a great looking laserdisc either) which was re-purposed to create their sub-standard looking DVD. That they then used the same inferior master to create a bluray is criminal. ""Thunderbean"" did a far superior job!

This new ""Thunderbean"" issue is not on a level with some of Disney's amazing looking, painstakingly remastered classics which the studio has issued on bluray, but you will never see a better version of this Fleischer Studios classic animated film.

""Thunderbean"" should be applauded for issuing classic animation which has been overlooked by others, and, even though they couldn't afford the kind of painstaking frame-by-frame digital restoration that Disney performs on their films for bluray release, for finding the best prints they could to produce their version.
Fleischer Studios was the only REAL competition for Disney Studios in the full-length animated film category, and in the short animation field had sizable hits of their own such as Popeye, Betty Boop and their amazing Superman cartoons (one of which, ""The Mechanical Monsters"" was borrowed heavily from for the film ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"").

It's too bad that subsequent financial downturns brought this studio down and left the full-length animated film market almost entirely to only Disney Studios. With their edgier sense of humor (listen to the remarks Popeye mutters under his breath in the early black and white Popeye cartoons) Fleischer Studios could have made some wonderful films over the years--if only they had survived. Alas.
If you are a fan of this picture, this version issued by ""Thunderbean"" is the one--and the ONLY one--to get! Avoid all other bluray versions at all cost (unless you want to see what a bluray with video quality no better than a VHS tape looks like!).",1412035200,3,2036,5.163636363636364
6296909,5,B00ITE4XUM,"Thunderbean, the reigning king of classic cartoons on home video, has done of their best releases yet with Max Fleischer's feature length classic.

If you're thinking the previous releases, even the nice Winstar DVD release from years ago, is enough, think again. The film hasn't looked this good since it premiered in 1939; it really changed my appreciation for the film.

Besides the main attraction, there's lots of extras, including eight classic Fleischer cartoons! There's some great ones (Modeling, In My Merry Oldsmobile, Paneless Window Washer, Is My Palm Red) and some not so great ones, but they all look way better than any previous release--once you see these films in glorious 1080p HD, you'll want to set your bargain bin tapes and DVDs on fire! In My Merry Oldsmobile in particular is my favorite; a classic Fleischer Screen Song, once only available in mediocre, grainy copies, now looks like it was made yesterday! Paneless Window Washer, while a little worn looking compared to the restored print on the official Popeye DVDs, boasts such pristine detail in 1080p HD, that it can easily hold it's own against that release. The already stunning backgrounds look even better than ever! Even the weaker cartoons like Little Dutch Mill are jaw drooping to look at, especially for the 3D stereoptical sets!

Overall; highly recommended. Hooray for Thunderbean!",1411862400,2,1373,5.120535714285714

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The animated classic is reborn on Blu-ray! Digitally restored and re-mastered using state-of-the-art technology, Max Fleischer's song-filled, 1939 masterpiece comes to life for the first time ever in awe-inspiring high definition. Richly drawn from the timeless tale by Jonathan Swifts novel Gulliver's Travels follows the legendary adventures of a shipwrecked sailor among the tiny people of Lilliput. In this strange land, Gulliver brings peace to two feuding kingdoms and reunites a prince with his princess before returning to the sea in one of the most ""hap-hap-happy"" endings of all time. Featuring breath-taking, newly-enhanced picture and sound, this definitive edition of Gulliver's Travels is a feast for the eyes and ears that your whole family will enjoy for years to come!

In December 1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs became the first feature-length animated film to open in theatres. Almost exactly two years later came the second, Gulliver's Travels [1939]. But in contrast to the Walt Disney classic, this new film was the work of pioneering animators Max and Dave Fleischer, whose innovative company had been responsible for Betty Boop and Popeye, among other iconic cartoon characters of the 1920s and 1930s. In fact, this animation film was originally planned as a vehicle for Popeye to play Gulliver.

Gulliver's Travels' is based on just the first part of Jonathan Swift's classic novel, a section entitled ""A Voyage to Lilliput,"" in which Gulliver washes ashore in a kingdom whose inhabitants are so small that Gulliver appears as a giant. Swift's tale was written as a sociological satire, and the Fleischer brothers disagreed at first over how much of that flavour would inhabit their screen version. Max Fleischer envisioned retaining the strong satirical themes, while Dave Fleischer wanted something lighter, simpler and more musical. In the end they compromised on a colourful spectacle that nonetheless does preserve some satire. In any event, the look and feel of the animation was distinctly theirs. As the Motion Picture Herald's review said, ""The Fleischer style, well known for many years to a great public, is readily identifiable. The usual grotesqueness is present in all of the characters, with the exception of the Giant and the Prince and Princess. One might expect Popeye to peek around the corner at any moment.""

The film's production schedule was very challenging. Paramount (the Fleischers' parent company and distributor) was so eager to challenge Disney with an animated feature that it poured money and resources into the movie in order to meet a Christmas 1939 release date. (The film opened a day after Gone with the Wind.) Fleischer Studios had been based in New York, but union strife in that city compelled Paramount to pay for a new Fleischer studio in Miami, Fla. The studio also paid for hundreds of extra animation artists to work on the project, in both Miami and Hollywood. The schedule was so rushed (18 months from conception to release) that 400 Miami art students were even hired to help out, following a crash course in animation. The final negative cost was about $1.5 million.

The critical reception was overall positive. Variety deemed the film ""an excellent job of animation, audience interest and all around showmanship... enjoyable as much for the elders as the youngsters."" But The New York Times disagreed, calling it ""a fairy tale for children almost exclusively,"" and criticising it for lacking the depth, subtlety, and freshness of the Walt Disney animation films.

Nonetheless, Gulliver's Travels' was a big enough commercial hit that Paramount Pictures ordered a second animated feature from the Fleischer's, Mr. Bug Goes to Town [1941]. As for awards, it was the film's music that drew attention from the Motion Picture Academy. Victor Young received an OSCAR nomination for Best Original Score, and songwriters Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin collected a nomination for Best Original Song, for ""Faithful Forever."" This was one of 22 Oscar nominations that Victor Young would receive over the course of his career. He won the award just once, posthumously for Around the World in Eighty Days [1956].

Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger also won their first OSCAR, for the classic song ""Thanks for the Memories,"" in The Big Broadcast of 1938. The talented composer Ralph Rainger would die in a plane crash in 1942, while lyricist Leo Robin would carry on a successful career over a life that lasted until his death in 1984. Robin accrued a total of ten Oscar nominations but never won the award again. Singer Lanny Ross provides the singing voice of Prince David in Gulliver's Travels. It's the only animated voice Lanny Ross ever did.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Fleischer Classics featuring Gulliver's Travels is presented on Blu-ray by Thunderbean Animation with an AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 1.33:1 and the release is hard matted with rounded corners, reproducing its original theatrical exhibition. Thunderbean Animation is the brainchild of Steve Stanchfield, who did a fund raising campaign to fund this restoration, which he painstakingly undertook without a huge staff (the credits list three total people handling digital clean-up, restoration and editing, with one more person listed as the telecine operator). This transfer was sourced from a variety of 35mm elements, though Steve Stanchfield mentions in his interesting liner notes that the bulk of the release stems from a 1957 print, though this print evidently had replacement footage from another print to replace damaged sections. Four other prints were utilized for various segments as well. The results here are quite beautiful, though there are some minor though noticeable colour space variations as well as density issues that occasionally crop up. The image retains the painterly depth that was the Max Fleischer's hallmark. There are still manifold scratches and minor imperfections that can be seen, but this is truly a remarkable achievement by a ""sole proprietor"" that should put any number of niche labels on notice as to what someone who really cares about what they're doing can offer to classic film aficionados. While a transfer from an interpositive or negative would have probably culled more pleasing results, the fact that this looks as wonderful as it does sourced from a ""mere"" print (or set of prints) is an astounding accomplishment.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio may surpass the image quality with a rather meek 2.0 channel stereo track that sounds more like a mono one. While the mono sounded better than I anticipated, it is far from an LPCM track that would have been more ideal and gets little in the way of dynamic separation. There are some noticeable differences in overall ambience that I assume can be attributed to the different source elements utilised for the transfer. There are occasional issues with hiss becoming more apparent in quieter sections, but overall this track, while not optimal, is at least listenable and doesn't present any problems. There are no subtitles which might have been a decent idea. As this is Public Domain, this is of course All Regions and is of course able to be played throughout the entire world.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Bonus Cartoons [1080p] [54:27] include:

Modeling [1921] The Clown causes trouble for the Cartoonist, and a sculptor using the studio, when he escapes from his backdrop and hides in the wet clay of a bust.

In My Merry Oldsmobile [1932] A lady is rescued from a villain by a heroic young man, who then takes her for a spin in his Oldsmobile.

Is My Palm Read [1933] Betty Boop visits Bimbo the fortune teller for some advice, but Bimbo is only interested in making time with Betty. Bimbo's crystal ball predicts that Betty will be shipwrecked on a desert isle (during which time she sings part of the Irving Berlin song All by Myself), and attacked by evil spirits resembling poltergeists, but rescued by Bimbo. When Bimbo reveals himself by removing his fake beard, a happy Betty embraces him. Unfortunately, a group of the ghosts from the vision burst in on this scene, and chase the two to the desert isle. Betty and Bimbo eventually escape from the ghosts by tricking them into going off a cliff into the sea.

Little Dutch Mill [1934] The scene painted on a Dutch plate sitting in a china cabinet comes to life. It's a simple tale of a Dutch Hans(el) and Gretel and their pet duck, who play around a mill inhabited by the town miser. The miser catches the children spying on him as he counts his gold and ties them up, threatening to burn their tongues out. The duck alerts the townspeople, and they clean up the old mill and the miser. In the process, the miser realizes that all his gold did not bring him happiness. The first Color Classic was photographed in the two-color Cinecolor process.

The Paneless Window Washer [1937] Bluto is trying to make a buck by spraying mud on the windows to make people think they're dirty. Up 20 stories (or at least Popeye says that) is Olive Oyl, public stenographer. Wiping all kinds of windows, Popeye and Bluto get into a bitter quarrel between who's better at cleaning windows.

Ding Dong Doggie [1937] Pudgy the Pup is impressed by a Dalmatian fire dog he sees out his window. Against Betty Boop's orders, Pudgy accompanies the fire dog to a fire at a general store. Pudgy tries to help out, but the fire takes on an (animated) life of its own and gets the better of Pudgy. In the end, Pudgy is happy to run back home to Betty Boop.

Two For The Zoo [1941] Gabby and the head zookeeper at the Lilliput Zoo bring in a new kangaroo to the zoo. A delivery man pushes a crate down the street containing a Rubber Necked Kango. Gabby bumps into the crate, and in his usual know-it-all fashion, offers to personally deliver the animal, a baby. Gabby doesn't know that the mother is also in the crate, and she catches up with them, dropping the baby into her pouch, causing Gabby to think that the baby suddenly grew. They end up getting trapped in the kangaroo's cage and the Kangaroo runs free. [Gabby is from the animation film Gulliver's Travels'].

Swing Cleaning [1941] The king allows Gabby to take over the supervision of the castle's spring cleaning with disastrous results. [Gabby is from the animation film `Gulliver's Travels'].

BONUS: You get a fantastic Fleischer Classics Featuring Gullivers Travels 12 page liner notes by Steve Stanchfield, packed with fact-filled essays with different sections explaining the information on the process that went into the this amazing animation classic Gulliver's Travels' by Max Fleischer. They include: Gulliver's Travel Notes by John McElwee; The Miami Gamble by Ray Pointer; On Gulliver's Travels by G. Michael Dobbs and Gulliver's Travels: Music To My Ears by Chris Buchman. Plus all the Design and Production Notes.

Finally, `Gulliver's Travel' has had quite a journey since its 1939 release. While the film was a rather marked success for Paramount in both its American and foreign releases, and went on to a regular broadcast life on television, it rightly or wrongly was never held in quite the same esteem as the early Walt Disney canon. Its home video releases up to now have been similarly lacklustre, even annoyingly offensive in some instances. This new release offers one of the titans of early Technicolor feature length animation looking wonderfully refreshed. While the audio is occasionally problematic, the supplemental features are totally outstanding, and Steve Stanchfield and his Thunderbean team, small though it may be, deserve the heartfelt thanks of all fans for this overall excellent release and it is such an honour to have this brilliant animation classic by Max Fleischer, who in my opinion is just as good, if not just as superior in adventurous animation as Walt Disney and has now gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

6296911,5,B00ITE4XUM,"I caught this wonderful old film countless times on a local UHF station as a young boy and had forgotten how much I loved it. I was soooo happy to discover that it had received a legitimate home video release, PLUS it has been remastered AND it'd in High-Def Blu-ray to boot! Remarkable!!! I hadn't seen the film in probably 20 years, but memories of the scenes and catchy music all came rushing back. It was like revisiting an old childhood friend. Gulliver himself is a wonder to behold and the Lilliputians are a fun and lovable bunch. Sadly, many (most?) younger folks seem to have never even heard of this film! It truly deserves better recognition. While the animation is occasionally rough in a few spots, for the most part it is breathtakingly beautiful. Tracing painted cells over live-action footage like Disney did for many of their classic animated films gives ""Gulliver"" that same unique and beautiful look as many of Walt's best works.

The Fleischer Studios could have been a legitimate contender for Disney's crown if only they hadn't gotten too big for their boots. They simply tried too much too soon, before establishing any sort of box office track record. They did more, so much more than this one film, to be sure, but their failure to be the ""other"" Disney/mainstream animated movie studio, (much the same as the decades later ill-fated Don Bluth Studios), cemented Fleischer's legacy in mainstream minds as the guys who made the 17 Superman animated short films and the B&W Popeye cartoons, and that's a damn shame. Luckily, Thunderbean has included 8 other shorts (including one of their excellent Popeye cartoons) on this disc, which is a nice touch. It will give those unfamiliar with Fleischer Studios excellent examples of just how talented they were and hopefully help underscore the loss that came when they finally closed their doors.

The only real downside of ""Gulliver's Travels"" (which I honestly never noticed until watching it again, as an adult), is how underdeveloped the characters are. There is essentially ZERO background story, character growth or arcs for any of the characters. Gulliver gets one scene where he sits by the seashore and dreams of someday returning home. That's pretty much it. Folks are introduced, the plot rushes along and before you know it, it's over. I never realized as a youngster how one-dimensional the characters were. I have the Kerwin Matthews ""3 Worlds of Gulliver"" film which is just OK, as well as the excellent 1995 ""Gulliver's Travels"" TV movie adaption. Oh my. If only the Fleischer Brothers had tackled the entire Gulliver novel the way that the Ted Danson mini-series did. What an amazing film THAT would have made. It would have trumped Disney for sure. But alas, it wasn't meant to be.

I am not thrashing Gulliver's Travels. Honest! This film still retains the power to enchant, especially the young (and young at heart). It's an important piece of animation history and a wonderful little film in it's own right. Just don't go in with any preconceived notions if you've never seen it before. The animation IS gorgeous, even more so now thanks to Thunderbean's careful restorative work. Kudos to Steve Stanchfield and his dedicated crew for undertaking such a project. Thunderbean Animation is a small outfit, so it was truly a labor of love. The Blu-ray's liner notes really help fill out the history of the studio and the nuts & bolts behind the feature film. The Blu-ray IS a tad on the pricey side, but the superior quality of this restored edition blows away EVERY other version of this film you're likely to see offered in those $1 DVD bargain bins. Those cheap, washed out, copy of a copy of a copy discs are a travesty! If you love classic animation, THIS is the edition of ""Gulliver's Travels"" that belongs on your shelf!!! 4 stars for the feature film (with it's beautifully restored picture & soundtrack) plus another star for including 8 more animated Fleischer Studio shorts as a bonus.",1405296000,4,3984,4.855882352941176
6296912,5,B00ITE4XUM,"Thunderbean has done a great service here in restoring the classic Gulliver's Travels.  In one sentence...if you are in a hurry... this is the best copy out there from what I have personally seen; buy this one.  As an Indie movie maker (Sisters Go Ye 'tralier on youtube'), I appreciate all the work Thunderbean did in putting this together.

6296913,5,B00ITE4XUM,"This film is an excellent example of the Fleischer Studio's work!  As I was growing up, it was shown many times and most everyone eagerly awaited the next time it would be broadcast.  I don't recall ever seeing it in a theater.  However, this transfer certainly reveals what Technicolor animation looks like when original preprint is used in the transfer process. Thunderbean is to be commended for its work on all of their releases, but this one is particularly good!  It is very sad to think that the negatives of all the films represented on this Bluray release are gone or significantly edited...",1398470400,,600,4.796116504854369
6296914,5,B00ITE4XUM,"THUNDERBEAN ANIMATION has done all fans of classic animation a great service here, with this lovingly restored Blue-ray release! Historically, ""Gulliver's Travels"" was the SECOND feature-length animated motion picture to come out of Hollywood in the 1930s, Disney's ""Snow White"" being the first. For the first time in decades, you can now see this film looking better than ever on Blue-ray. A REAL TREAT! Incredible Tecnicolor! A real dream come true for ""Gulliver"" fans! You won't be dissapointed. Also included are bonus materials of vintage music tracks and radio shows (including one with Meredith Willson, the creator of ""The Music Man""), products and celluloids (and other artifacts) from the film; as well as short cartoons also produced by the Fleisher Studio. AND! Some great liner-notes on the film's history!!!",1397779200,,821,5.372093023255814
6296915,5,B00ITE4XUM,"This was a staple of Sunday afternoon television for years and now Thunderbean have released the definitive blu-ray set. The quality is so good, I almost gasped. It's like seeing the film for the first time. Hats off to the fanatics at Thunderbean who really have captured the Fleischer magic in hi-def. On the whole, the packaging is a little rough around the edges but the price is right. The informative booklet that comes with the disks appears to have been produced on the cheap but everything looks so good that I can't really complain. Can't wait to watch with my 3-year-old nephew.",1397692800,,589,4.728155339805825
6296916,5,B00ITE4XUM,"This is the ""Gulliver"" to get.

Okay, so it's not ""Snow White,"" even if it's trying to be (I'm surprised the Fleischers didn't call it ""Gulliver and the 7,000 Dwarfs""). Still, I've heard from more than one former Disney animator that they prefer ""Gulliver's Travels"" to what they were working on in the '90s. ""Gulliver"" was not the flop it's fabled to be. It was one of the top grossers in what is generally considered the definitive year for movies; unfortunately, it didn't make money for Paramount owing to the costly and ill-advised relocation of the Fleischer cartoon studio to Miami (which had no film processing facilities). Like all Fleischer films, it would have been much better if not for the desperate attempts to emulate Disney--the way to compete is by not competing but rather focusing on developing one's own strengths, which in the Fleischers' case were considerable--and if they'd had more time for training and preparation rather than crashing ahead with production with so many inexperienced and hastily hired artists. (The first close-up of Princess Glory makes her look as though she is suffering from Bell's palsy.)

But what a pleasure to see an optimum quality print at long last. The restoration is not perfect, and it would actually detract from the product if it were. We should all have so few lines on our faces at age 74 (75 in December)! The added Fleischer shorts, on the other hand, are the same old ratty public domain prints we know so well from TV and cheap video collections. Maybe they were included for the sake of contrast, to show how much work Thunderbean put into ""Gulliver."" And there's certainly nothing wrong with getting a bit more for your money, which is a rarity these days.

Thank you, Thunderbean. Now if you could do likewise with ""Hoppity"" (aka ""Mr. Bug Goes to Town,"" the second Fleischer feature, a typically cheesy print currently being hawked on DVD under the title ""Bugville"").",1396742400,2,1937,4.863636363636363
6296917,5,B00ITE4XUM,"Last night I crossed my fingers and screened Gulliver's Travels. I was in total awe of this beautiful transfer. I screened the film on a 12 foot screen using a 2500 Lumens video projector, and the colors filled the room! You have never seen this film until you see Thunderbean's copy. Beleive me it's a totally new experience than ever before. There is one section where a 16mm Low Fade print was used. This is at the 29:47 mark and lasts 20 seconds, other than that it's PERFECT. This is certainly the way Max & Dave intended their film to be seen. Great job Thunderbean!
Hopefully they are working on ""Mr Bugs Goes to Town""...",1396483200,,628,4.469565217391304
6296918,5,B00ITE4XUM,"A big round of applause to Steve Sanchfield and his team at Thunderbean. They managed to work a miracle with this classic Fleischer Bros. film, which has only been available in ugly public domain versions over the past 40 years. And they did so without access to the studio vaults. They pieced this film together using a 1958 Technicolor IB print, which is basically a print used to screen at theaters for patrons. Not an archival print. Fortunately, IB technicolor dyes don't tend to fade if they are properly stored. Unless Paramount releases an official version from their vaults, this is the best you're ever going to see this film in a public domain incarnation.",1396137600,2,667,4.808695652173913

Fully restored from a vintage 35mm Technicolor print with alternate prints providing footage for a few sections and the original Paramount logo at the top.  A wealth of Gulliver-related material is included as extras, along with a tasty selection of restored Fleischer short cartoon classics for the icing on this marvelous animated cake.
