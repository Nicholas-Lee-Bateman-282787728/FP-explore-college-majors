Shot during a festival that lasted for days, what we are offered here are glimpses of the comedians that were in attendance performing. The offerings are wrapped around by host Cheech Marin as he makes quips about the performers and introduces them, at times giving them awards for various qualities on display.

The problem is that most of these comedians aren't all that funny. I would say it's because I'm not their target audience but the fact of the matter is I've seen some of these performers here and loved them in the past. Most notably is Paul Rodriquez who seems to have lost the quality that he had when he first started. The same is true for John Mendoza who at one time I thought was one of the funniest comedians around. His deadpan delivery was topped only by Steven Wright.

Perhaps the problem revolves around giving so little time for each performer so that so many could be on display in this DVD. I'm hoping that's the case. I know many of those included here have shown they can be funny but this showcase doesn't display anything worth laughing at. Rather than watch this I'd suggest catching any of these performers on Comedy Central where they have the chance to show how funny they can truly be.",1371600000,,1473,4.50936329588015
