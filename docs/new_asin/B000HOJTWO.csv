8589686,1,B000HOJTWO,This DVD lasts for 80 minutes - 'Carmen' usually lasts for much much  longer = 172 minutes Levine. There are far to many cuts and hacks in this performance. You wince along open mouthed at what happens. Is this opera for people who do not like opera? The performance itself is OK so perhaps it should be treated as highlights but no more.,1181174400,7,338,4.365079365079365
