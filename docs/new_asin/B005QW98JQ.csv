8483929,5,B005QW98JQ,"I enjoyed this collection a lot. Although in my opinion, Collection 7 was better. Still I give this one 5 stars. Here are my thoughts on the episodes:

Where It All Began - shows Tony's rise from a cook and author to a major TV personality.

Liberia - interesting for me because I know very little about Africa. Tony takes some chances by going to a place like this. Nicely done.

Dubai - this was my favorite episode of the regular episodes. Tony goes to an indoor ski area in Dubai. It is very hot outside but cool inside. Also he has lunch with some Arabs who, except for their clothing, seem much like us.

Rome - the food looked awesome in this one. You will see an argument break out between customers and the owner because the wait for a table in the restaurant is too long.

Madrid - I liked this episode less than the other episodes. Lots of old men cooking. Still not bad.

Kerala, India - facinating! Tony goes on a houseboat and eats some delicious food. Tony meets one of India's biggest TV stars. He is actually rather nice and down to earth. They have lunch in the star's trailer.

Paris - contains a lot of discussion on the new way of dining in Paris today. Tony's chef friend Eric represents the old way of doing things. He constantly needs to defend himself when talking with the other chefs.

Back to Beirut - a very important episode for those who saw the first time Tony and his crew went to Beirut and a war broke out. This time things are much better.

What Were We Thinking (100th Episode) - this was part of the bonus features and well worth watching. It highlights some of the high points of the last 100 episodes. Lots of insight here into things I did not know about some of the episodes. A really nice look back that will make you smile.

Making of India - this episode contains lots of technical stuff on how to get the best shot with regard to lighting, background noise etc. Also shows the planning process involved to make a show like this. It also helps you know some of the people working behind the scenes.

Overall a very good season to watch. Enjoy.",1409011200,7,2088,4.328205128205128
