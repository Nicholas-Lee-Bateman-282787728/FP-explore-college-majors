8523943,5,B0081I0RLA,Perfect way to get in shape for my recent wedding.  It was fun and easy to tone up!  I am recommending it to all my friends.,1424131200,,124,3.730769230769231
8523944,5,B0081I0RLA,"Yes there is one small part where she works out in heels, but it's to increase the intensity of the exercise.
Overall it's a very good workout, but the sexiness is a little hokey and overdone. Doesn't take away from it though.",1398556800,2,226,4.404761904761905
8523945,2,B0081I0RLA,I guess when the part of the video at which she's working out in high heel ruined it for me :(,1371513600,,94,3.5238095238095237
8523946,5,B0081I0RLA,Fantastic. Very easy to do. I'm always very stiff but these movements were east to do and really helped my core muscles.,1364515200,,120,4.5
8523947,2,B0081I0RLA,This video is poorly  made.  It was difficult to play as the segments didn't flow consecutively.  Each segment needed you to press play. I want an exercise video to keep playing until it's finished. I don't recommend this video workout.,1363996800,,236,4.85
8523948,2,B0081I0RLA,"The instructor has some really good exercises.  The exercises themselves are great, however the editing of the DVD is horrible.  The facilities utilized to make the video don't look professional, you can definitely tell it was a low budget production.  The whole production environment is flawed, it is not conducive or motivating.  It could have been such a better product if it was done in a more professional manner.",1362441600,,419,5.028985507246377
8523949,2,B0081I0RLA,"As a fitness instructor I was very interested in this, excited to get it even. While it demonstrates good technique it is poorly put together, sound & music quality & choice poor.  appearing breathless as you lead a fairly simple, low cardio workout does not appear professional or encouraging. the only thing I got from this dvd is a good technique reminder :(",1361404800,,361,4.73015873015873
8523950,3,B0081I0RLA,"I purchased the kama movement video after seeing it on the Doctors.  Although I think that doing this video may help to strengthen your pelvic floor if done regularly I am just not impressed.  The video recommends practicing the video with the instructional part first.  The problem is that half the time she is giving you instructions to do something they are doing a close up shot of her upper body and face when she is showing you something to do with your feet and hips and maybe even arm movements that you can't even see.  It's very difficult to learn the movements if you can't see what she is doing.  Also some of the time you can't hear her because her movements somehow must have blocked the microphone.  They should have corrected this problem before releasing this video.  The second part of the video that isn't dancing is easier to follow, with the exception of some microphone issues.

I would not necessarily purchase this video again.  If you are having some issues with your pelvic floor, falling bladders or other female issues I do think with regular work this video would help.  I just think they could have done a better job.",1360454400,2,1147,4.605911330049261
8523951,1,B0081I0RLA,"Was not what I expected, really disappointed. I was expecting more of a workout. If you just want to sit or stand and gyrate this is the video for you.",1359417600,2,151,4.066666666666666
