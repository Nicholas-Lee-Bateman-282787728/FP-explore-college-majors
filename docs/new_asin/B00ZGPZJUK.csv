8720231,3,B00ZGPZJUK,"This was a different twist on the Frankenstein story. A scientist trying to grow artificial organs, including a heart for her dying son, accidentally grows a complete creature that is quickly on the loose. I think the story felt a little rushed at times and there were many unanswered questions at the end. Perhaps it was intended to launch a series? The relationship between the doctor and her husband, who runs a biotech firm, wasn't very convincing to me. The quality of the video is meh. If you're on the treadmill some night and need something to stare at while you're walking, this fits the bill, though. Good concept.",1514851200,,624,4.73394495412844

8720233,2,B00ZGPZJUK,"Supposedly the writer of this adaptation returned to the source material of the original novel for an updated modern take. But I really could not find much of the heart of the original story. So much of what is great about Frankenstein is drastically altered that I found it difficulty to appreciate. Yes, Dr. Frankenstein's motivation to cheat death is there and the intentions are a twisted way to help others, but from there we get an odd story. The Monster escapes its way out of the laboratory and left on its own to fall victim to its own emotions, leaving a body count in its wake. It makes sense that the modern creation of the Monster would not be stitched together body pieces, but the look of the creature leaves a hell of a lot to be desired. It looks stupid. The low budget doesn't help the cause. You can easily Google a picture of the Creature. It is not terrifying. Once the characters piece together what the Monster is, we see a corporation swoop in to gain control, wanting to weaponize the creation and we lose the real terror of the original story and menace of the Creature. Maybe worth a rental, but spare yourself from a blind buy",1474416000,3,1154,4.4739336492890995

8720235,4,B00ZGPZJUK,"This is a 2007 ITV production from Great Britain. For a television film it is, in spite of its low-budget construction, an interesting version of the timeless tale. Helen McCrory is Victoria Frankenstein, her husband, Dr. Clerval, is played by James Purefoy, and both are good in that solid, no nonsense English way. Not to give too much away, the plot moves includes a mood-setting climate-altering natural event (it shapes the ""climate"" of the whole film, though it has happened in the storyline's recent past), as well as what a mother (not the father, this time) will do for love. Well worth the price of admission, as they say.",1453075200,5,632,4.807339449541284
