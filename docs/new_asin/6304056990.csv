770953,5,6304056990,"You will love watching this one with your entire family, as it's a true story and I think everyone needs to know what goes on with these whales that are in captivity.  It's very sad and I think they need to be set free. See what you think!",1354492800,,239,3.9791666666666665
770954,4,6304056990,"This is an old film, however it really melts your heart. The relationship between humans and killer whales have been controversy since the 60's. This good old time film sets the belief and brings a stronger message than just friendship. It also shows how adversity can be turned around to great hopes. A heart-warming movie!",1345939200,2,324,4.909090909090909
770955,5,6304056990,"This is a great movie!  The best part is at the end.  The beginning is sad, for some people.  I don't want to tell you too much about it but I think you should get this movie and add it to your collection!!!",1339027200,,207,3.7674418604651163
770956,5,6304056990,"Quick transaction, super prompt delivery. I am pleased with the item I bought, the image is very good, the sound is also very good, and it's also got subtitles in English,which I prefer,as well as in Spanish and French, for everybody to understand.

770957,5,6304056990,"If you like movies about Orcas, then you will love this heartwarming true story about this very special bond between man and Orcas.  This classic movie has great acting and no special effects!  They actually used a real Orca whale in shooting this film.",1325548800,5,253,4.7272727272727275
770958,5,6304056990,i think this is wonderful movie for all ages. it was made in 1966 so its pretty old but worth it they use a real whale named namu if any kids go to sea world and wonder where the name namu comes from this movie has the original namu. its agreat story on friendship and the people learn about the orca in the movie they think is a killer. Namu ofcourse sint a killer he doesnt harm anyone infact the only reason hes in that cove was to help his mate then eventually greieve over her. the man in the movie hank donner looks after him and studies him eventually becoming frineds a little girl also befriends him adn even talks to namu. i won't tell you everything but at that time no one knew alot about these beautiful animals and in this one you learn some things. its a great movie i recommend it to all.,1304208000,6,804,4.127388535031847
770959,5,6304056990,fast shipping great price for an obscure movie item in great condition. would buy from again.,1284249600,3,93,4.875
770960,4,6304056990,"This movie was made in the 60s, but wears well.  It is the true story of the first killer whale ever captured.  Better than the Free Willy movies.  And if your kids ever saw Shamu at SeaWorld and wondered what Shamu means, it means ""friend of Namu"" -- yes, this Namu in the movie.",1199232000,9,280,4.148148148148148
771076,2,6304056990,"I had seen this movie years and years ago and thought it was pretty good,  but watching it again now that I know much more about orca's I found it be inaccurate and very sad.  It's an OK movie,  but I didn't even keep my copy,  not something I ever want to see again.",1430438400,,267,3.888888888888889

771080,2,6304056990,This is an old movie and the quality of the special effects is pretty bad compared to what we are use these days.,1393718400,,113,3.9565217391304346

771082,4,6304056990,"I saw it as a kid and enjoyed it. It showcases not only the whale, but the human characters as well. It provides an all-around good lesson for all. I have always been a fan of Lee Meriwether.",1386460800,2,191,4.052631578947368
771083,4,6304056990,"NAMU:My Best Friend with Robert Lansing was a interesting movie from the time period of the 60's.  I enjoyed watching this movie.  The actual ""filming"" was fairly good for the time.  A good family movie.",1375315200,2,203,4.742857142857143

771085,5,6304056990,"I absolutely love this movie.  I have watched it many times.  Someday I hope to purchase it for my Amazon Instant Video Library because I know that sooner or later it will be taken off of the Prime free list.
Every time I watch it I wonder if Robert Lanzing really swam with the whale.  It sure looked like him.  Great, Great, Great movie.",1357430400,,339,4.25
7860492,5,6304056990,Love this movie!!,1517788800,,17,5.0
7860493,4,6304056990,I love this family friendly movie about a man and a misunderstood killer whale. Robert Lansing is stoic in the role of the naturalist but the real star of the movie is the whale. Lee Merriweather is wonderful in a supporting role.,1516924800,,230,4.5
7860494,5,6304056990,"Originally titled ""Namu the Killer Whale"", it's a fun look at San Juan Island back in the day before the Great California Migration. It features many locals and is fun to watch if you grew up here. Sadly Namu died before the movies release, probably due to little knowledge on the species at the time. I'm sure it inspired many to study marine biology.",1489708800,,352,4.515625

7860498,5,6304056990,Fell in love with this movie when it was on netflix and had to own it so naturally came to amazon. I'm pretty sure that this is the first captive killer whale and is a pretty amazing story of the understanding gained of these animals in the 1960's.,1468627200,,248,4.1875
7860499,3,6304056990,"Before there was Shamu, there was Namu! And here he is in his sparkling Hollywood finery. It's a cutesy older film about the days when we knew nothing about Orca. Unfortunately Namu died in captivity, miles from his pod, as so many after him have done...",1457740800,,254,4.543478260869565
