7885633,1,6305215979,"I'll tell you what I think, this is the worst acting ever, notice it had one review, I waste my money on this dvd. Poor actors and actresses,weak plots etc. At the very start of this movie bore me into tears. What really amazes me,theses lousy film director's and writers put together garbage films, know wonder, it doesn't make it on the big screens. I've seen better low budget films oppose to this mess.

I know what a ""great"" movie is, Malcolm X, Asunder, All About You, Shaft, Fatal Attraction,Mission Impossible 2, should I go on. To all viewers don't waste your money on this lousy film.",1147910400,2,594,4.5514018691588785
7885634,5,6305215979,"In this action packed, who done it thriller, you will meet Lola (Tammara Mello) the sultry bayou girl who is introduced to Shane, an ex-champion boxer turned Los Angeles record producer(Gary Stretch)who is down on his luck and in a bad marriage to high society wife (Vannessa Sadler). When Shane hears Lola sing, he knows she is his ticket to the big time. The only problem is that Lola's New Orleans mafia boyfriend, Decker (John Shaefer)doesn't want to losen the reins to let her be who she wants to be. While out of town on business, Decker orders Vinny, who is his right hand man to keep an eye on his girl.  Vinny gets side tracked and Lola sneaks out and meets up with Shane to discuss her career.  She ends up in bed with him and then ends up dead the next morning.  Shane gets blamed for her murder, but did he do it?  Did Vinny do it?  Did Shane's jealuos wife do it?  This film doesn't slow down. You'll sit on the edge of your seat until you learn the truth. The fights scenes are pretty swinging too!

This film was written by Dana Holyfield & Jon Hess.
