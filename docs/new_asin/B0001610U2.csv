8007120,5,B0001610U2,"This is a must see for any social worker or law student who wishes to work with at-risk youth (or anyone elso who cares about the problems of youth violence).  This movie is a revealing, but disturbing, look into a unique success story in our country's youth penal system.  If Profesor Miller continues to make documentary films of this importance and quality, he could be the next Michael Moore.",1078272000,,396,4.72463768115942
8007121,5,B0001610U2,"A compelling documentary taking viewers into the heart of the CYA. How the inmates got there is revealed as we watch them interact with Miller and his students who are giving them the skills and opportunity to make their own short film. It's a real cry for a stonger arts program in the CYA. It's also a documentary that would be excellent for educational purposes, whether for college students, prison employees, or public safety personnel.",1076284800,,441,4.8933333333333335
