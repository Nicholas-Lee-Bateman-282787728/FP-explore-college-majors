8082725,3,B000B78EFU,"I think ""Quicksand"" is very under rated. I was very happy to see that Amazon had made it available. Mickey Rooney is such a good actor! Not merely ""Judge Hardy's son"" as we are inclined to think-----catch Mickey in a ""Midsummer Nights' Dream"". Very versitle  actor In spite of the Andy Hardy casting. The second feature--more Andy Hardy but good as always-----I never thought of him as a returning soldier!",1292284800,,406,4.8
