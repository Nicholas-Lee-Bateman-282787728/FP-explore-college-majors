8585135,5,B00CQRNM0U,"I think some people have missed the point with these latest 4 HULLABALOO DVD releases.
It is clear that these 4 DVDs do not duplicate the earlier 12 volumes issued by MPI in
the 1990s on VHS and then DVD.
Of course Peter Nero isn't ""hip"" in the traditional sense but what is fascinating about
these shows is that they represent the melting pot of music in the 1960s when
rock, pop, soul, folk and easy listening merged on radio and television.
There was something on Hullabaloo for the kids and the parents.
Artists like Paul Anka and Dionne Warwick, heard here, appealed to
both and are still going strong almost 50 years later!
Most of the major rock acts and their hits were presented on the
earlier DVDS but it is fun to have this opportunity to view what
else was on the show and still get some legacy performers
on these 4 DVDs like Johnny Rivers, Peter & Gordon, Dusty Springfield,
The Ronettes, The Everly Brothers, Four Tops, Jay & The Americans,
Lesley Gore, The Supremes and dozens more. Rare stuff at a good price.",1387324800,2,1026,4.491978609625669
8585136,3,B00CQRNM0U,"Culled largely from Hullabaloo's second episode (January 19/65), with clips of The Supremes and Little Anthony &The Imperials added for good measure, Hullabaloo Collection 4 is in my opinion, the weakest entry of the set. Paul Anka hosts, and introduces Dionne Warwick, a young Liza Minelli and pianist virtuoso Peter Nero. Rockers Johnny Rivers and The Nashville Teens are also present, but do little to enliven this set, and the whole episode is a bit of a snoozer. Even the Top Pop segment, usually a highlight, is one of the poorer offerings. Why? It was an early episode and perhaps the show was still finding its feet. The May episodes, late in the season, seem the more lively and better balanced, and I think its no surprise they were the hour long episodes released in their entirety years ago.

In Black & White, the DVD is transferred from kinescope, so picture and sound are mediocre. The bonus is an interview with Lada Edmund Jr., the frenetic Hullabaloo dancer best remembered as 'the girl in the cage'. The interview, short as it is, is from a PBS fundraiser, and poorly done at that. If like myself, you're a fan of Hullabaloo, by all means add this disc to your collection. But be warned, this DVD is definitely the weak sister in the 4-disc set.",1379721600,4,1264,4.668161434977579
8585137,2,B00CQRNM0U,"What an embarrassing look-back on an exciting era.

Hullabaloo was a fun, lively, entertaining show. You wouldn't know it from this strange concoction of clips. Granted, Paul Anka, Liza, and Dionne were nice touches in this DVD, but the rest of it fell flat on its face.

The ""bonus"" content was just a badly edited rehash of an interview done during a PBS funding drive.

MPI has done a remarkable disservice to fans and to the show. The suggested retail price is outrageous; you get 55 minutes of mediocrity. Shop around; copies can be found in major chains for half the price.

And by the way: There are ZERO color clips in this DVD, even though the cover art is nothing but full-color photos. Another MPI deception.",1379721600,3,719,4.637795275590551
8585138,1,B00CQRNM0U,"Yes, I know, royalties, rights, blah, blah, blah. If a product contains what people want, they will pay the price. Here's a short list of what they could've added (I know a few of these are on these new volumes and the older releases, but the musicians performed multiple songs and some were on multiple episodes, so there's a wealth of unreleased material out there)......

The Cyrkle
The Yardbirds
Gerry & The Pacemakers
The Hollies
The Bobby Fuller Four
Smokey Robinson & The Miracles
The Vogues
The Byrds
Paul Revere & The Raiders
Gary Lewis & The Playboys
The Mamas & The Papas
The Moody Blues
The Marvelettes
The Turtles
The Lovin' Spoonful
Sonny & Cher
The Strangeloves
The Searchers
Marvin Gaye
The Young Rascals
Sir Douglas Quintet
Chuck Berry
The Four Seasons
Freddie & The Dreamers
The Kinks
The Band Of Angels
The Shangri-Las
The Kingsmen
The Rolling Stones
The Remains

...and on, and on. The only volume even slightly interesting is Volume 3, because of The Animals and Dusty Springfield. MPI Video has always been one of the worst......",1379203200,3,1051,4.801104972375691
8585139,1,B00CQRNM0U,"Wow! I obviously haven't actually seen any of these new Hullabaloo sets yet since they won't be released for another week but I'm afraid just looking at the lists of what's on 'em tells me all I need to know. Are we really supposed to believe that the BEST of Hullabaloo (as included on disc 4, to pick one at random) means Liza Minnelli, Paul Anka, Noel Harrison, Peter Nero and Fred Smoot (FRED SMOOT?!) but NOT The Bobby Fuller Four, The Remains or Paul Revere & The Raiders? Gimme a break!

The other discs don't seem much better. A shame since, as noted in other comments, the original VHS releases included complete shows and (much!) better individual performances as well. I worked at MPI when those were produced and was involved in putting them together. Can only imagine that there must be some heavy licensing costs involved for the DVD rights now - more than MPI wants to pay. That's the only explanation I can think of for including the likes of Lola Falana whilst leaving The Kinks and The Yardbirds on the cutting room floor.

By the way, all the shows were originally broadcast in color but only four survive in color. The rest are b&w kines, unless new sources have come to light recently (quite possible since the original VHS tapes were released by MPI almost 20 years ago). It's true that the picture and audio quality of the kines is at times poor but many of the performances are excellent and I for one would much prefer to watch a relatively poor copy of The Shangri-Las singing Great Big Kiss than a pristine copy of Peter Nero singing I Wanna Hold Your Hand!

I was really happy to see that MPI was finally putting the show out on DVD but after checking the track listings I'm wondering why they are bothering and who they are doing it for. These discs are scraping the very bottom of the Hullabaloo barrel.

Oh well, maybe someday they'll put the good stuff out! Guess we'll just have to wait. (Still waiting for a quality official Shindig! release too! Don't know who owns the rights to that one these days and of course music licensing can be expensive but it sure would be nice to see!)",1378166400,18,2116,4.488311688311688
8585140,4,B00CQRNM0U,"For fans of the 1965-1966 Hullabaloo show, MPI is bringing more great performances to dvd in a Best Of Hullabaloo series consisting of 4 separate dvd's available September 10th, 2013. In 2000 to 2002, MPI produced Hullabaloo Vols. 1-4, Hullabaloo Vols. 5-8 and Hullabaloo Vols. 9-12. In these older Volume sets, MPI included some of the Hullabaloo shows on dvd, all in their entirety. The film quality was not the greatest, but seeing the entire shows were fabulous! These Volume Sets from 2000-2002 are now priced out of most people's price range, so being able to purchase these new Best Of Hullabaloo 4 different sets may be a nice alternative.

I truly wish MPI would have made more of the Volume Sets, which include the Hullabaloo Shows in their entirety, instead of these 4 Best Of sets, but I'm happy with any of the old Hullabaloo performances, so I'll take what I can get. I heard the film quality is just like the older Volume Sets- not the greatest, but MPI is including 16-17 performances on each dvd and some fabulous bonus material. MPI always includes great bonus material when they can get it for their dvd's, and they did get some great interviews for these 4 Best Of dvd's. I did try and compare the performances on these Hullabaloo Best Of dvd's with my 2000-2002 Hullabaloo Volume dvd's, and I can only say I found maybe a couple duplicate performances. So, even if you own the Hullabaloo Vols. 1-4, Hullabaloo Vols. 5-8 and Hullabaloo Vols. 9-12, you will enjoy these Best Of performances, of which most are not included in the Volume Sets.

I will list the performances MPI is including in this Best Of Hullabaloo: 4, along with the Bonus Interview, so you can decide if you want it or if you want to compare it to the Volume Sets- if you own them. For the money, this is a great buy, but it is not what I wished for, which would have been a continuation of the Hullabaloo Volumes of the complete shows- only digitally remastered! I love seeing these old Hullabaloo performances again, but seeing the entire old shows with remastered film would have rated 5 Stars, instead of the 4 Stars I'm giving this dvd. The performances alone, the fabulous interview material and great price still rate 4 stars with me, as I know I'll still enjoy going back to 1965-1966 viewing these great stars again in their prime. Here is what you will find on this Best Of Hullabaloo: 4:

01.) Paul Anka- Young, Alive & In Love
02.) Dionne Warwick- Reach Out For Me
03.) The Nashville Teens- Tobacco Road
04.) Paul Anka & Johnny Rivers- Mountain Of Love
05.) Fred Smoot- Comedy Routine
06.) Liza Minnelli- Gypsy In My Soul
07.) Top Pop Medley: Dionne Warwick- You'll Never Get To Heaven
08.) Paul Anka- Diana
09.) Dionne Warwick- Walk On By
10.) Paul Anka- Put Your Head On My Shoulder
11.) Anka, Warwick, Liza Minnelli- Hello Dolly
12.) Marianne Faithful- As Tears Go By
13.) Peter Nero- I Want To Hold Your Hand
14.) Liza Minnelli- Together
15.) Paul Anka- The Longest Day
16.) The Supremes- Come See About Me
17.) Little Anthony & The Imperials- I'm Alright
BONUS: Interview With Hullabaloo Dancer Lada Edmund Jr. (Lada was the Go-Go dancer you would never miss at the end of every show- she was in the cage)",1376438400,20,3211,4.590592334494773
