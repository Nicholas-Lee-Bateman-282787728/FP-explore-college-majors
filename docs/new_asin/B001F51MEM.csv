3564254,5,B001F51MEM,"One man takes on a dying planet. Simple, heart felt and inspired. Peter Proctor is a gentle man that quietly goes about the business of changing the way we farm. The dead soil of India, stripped of it's nutrients by harsh fertilizers and pesticides is turned back into rich earth though the practice of Biodynamic farming. Dying land and desperate farmers are saved by this unlikely hero. The film is beautifully written and photographed and well worth a look.",1221004800,28,460,4.8354430379746836
3564255,5,B001F51MEM,"This is a beautiful film that shows an inspiring journey of Peter Proctor, whom many call ""the father of biodynamics."" The film follows him on an mission to India to help farmers who have been severely taken advantage of by Monsanto and its so-called ""green revolution."" It's amazing to see how one man can offer so much help, knowledge, and heartfulness to so many others. He travels to countless Indian farms and teaches them some biodynamic principles to help them get their farms turned around and back to being self-sufficient. You can't help but feel called to go plant a garden after seeing this wonderfully inspiring film.",1221004800,7,630,4.897196261682243

3564257,5,B001F51MEM,"This is a perfect example of the new age of film making. The film is telling positive truths of how individuals can make our world a better place. It is enthralling. Many many good things will save the planet, just we have stuffed it up with many many ignorant things.",1220918400,5,268,4.38
3564258,5,B001F51MEM,"Just the word ""agriculture"" is enough to make most people glaze over, but this film charmingly explains one of the most potentially arcane subjects of all, BIODYNAMIC agriculture. This is a farming system that descends from the ideas of the great poet and thinker Goethe, sows plants by the phases of the moon, and advocates the burial of compost in cow horns. The film shows how it all makes sense, even to those of us who are hopelessly urban, and it also shows how this system of farming has the potential to create a true Green Evolution. Wonderful characters. Beautifully filmed.",1220918400,7,584,4.792079207920792
3564259,5,B001F51MEM,"This is a compelling, wonderfully made film about a future that could make sense. It is obvious that we have hit the wall of what is called ""progress"" and this film shows the path we could follow to create a durable planet. It's great fun too!",1220918400,4,243,4.304347826086956

3564261,5,B001F51MEM,"This film looks at biodynamic agriculture, a Rudolph Steiner-inspired system of organic farming. It primarily focuses on New Zealander Peter Proctor and his work promoting biodynamics worldwide, particularly in India. Proctor argues that modern industrial agriculture (e.g. artificial fertilizers and pesticides and genetically engineered seeds) has made soil and plants toxic, and modern farming unsustainable.

Especially interesting is the obvious social changes that occur in Indian communities where Proctor has reintroduced more ""natural"" methods of agriculture.

With increasing fossil fuel depletion predicted to make the cost of artificial fertilizers and pesticides prohibitive for the average farmer, it's great to see both first and third world countries taking up this alternative. Especially as recent studies show that correctly applying the techology of biodynamic agriculture produces higher crop yields than industrial agriculture.",1282262400,3,949,6.292307692307692
3564262,4,B001F51MEM,this movie doc was very informative to understand the problems of commercial farming and provides good info and practical knowledge in setting up organic farming communites,1277510400,,172,5.653846153846154
3564263,2,B001F51MEM,"""One Man, One cow, One Planet"", apparently is not the same movie as"" How To Save The World : One Man, One Cow, One Planet"", as it is missing the original opening segment that showed the cutting up of an apple to represent various parts of the planet. This was a powerful statement that seemed to set the ""tone"" for the movie. I was quite disappointed to discover this. There was no information describing the difference between these two films.",1259712000,2,444,4.5625

3564265,5,B001F51MEM,A wonderful man showing Indian farmers BioDynamic farming methods.  Poor Indian farmers are taking up this method of sustainable agriculture that has allowed them to return the land back to the health it was before mono agriculture was introduced.  Totally inspiring!,1236816000,,267,5.487804878048781

3564267,5,B001F51MEM,"Having understood the cutthroat commercialism/non ethics in certain agri/dairy farming practices in India, I was seriously contemplating on how to make a change to at least a small sector down south in India by doing this in the right manner. Came across this documentary on bio dynamic practice,where I saw Peter's involvement on such a cause. This DVD is a must have for anyone(in my case not even a farmer/farming background) who is planning to make a difference to the society and even for people with commercial aspirations in the field of medium to large scale farming.",1228608000,6,575,4.938144329896907
3564268,5,B001F51MEM,"After seeing this film, we immediately started a recycle bin and compost pile.  So far, we've used the organic material in our garden and have had a great year of veggies.  It's a wonderful feeling.  And it's a great film.  Can't wait for the sequel. We have shared this with all our friends.",1221350400,19,292,4.452830188679245
3564269,5,B001F51MEM,An incredibly inspirational DVD on what IS possible when communities come together and support one another. Highly recommended.,1221264000,3,127,6.111111111111111
3564270,5,B001F51MEM,"This is a fine, instructive, very moving film. It demonstrates graphically and clearly how biodynamic agriculture is a practical, safe, cheap, alternative to industrial chemicals and pesticides. It's wonderful to know that such people exist. They need to be nominated for sainthood.",1221177600,18,282,5.738095238095238

8300974,5,B001F51MEM,"An amazing film to show how bioenergetics farming can feed the world without the need for toxic chemicals. Destroying our planet for a short profit should be stopped. smallholdings, individual gardeners and public space food should be encouraged.",1401753600,,246,5.5

8300977,5,B001F51MEM,"Regardless of your farming practises this is a must see to make your own judgement of sustainable agriculture. We have stopped using all acid based fertilizers and us a lot of soil feeders with great results.
This DVD I saw six years ago and it helped change our farming pattern and dramatically lifted our profitability.

8300978,3,B001F51MEM,"First, just to be clear, I grew up farming.  I'm very involved in the support and advocacy of sustainable, clean, and local food and farming.  I keep an urban garden and a small but very functional compost operation.  I contribute financially to several like minded organizations and sit on a few of their boards.  I shop at the organic and farmers markets, blah, blah.  You get the idea.  However, I somewhat disagree with advocating biodynamic practices, at least here in the US.  The ONLY reason I feel this way is because many of the ""mystical"" processes involved are ripe for slander by those inclined to slander or otherwise resist ANY change to the current industrial food chain.  I fear these biodynamic detractors may then attempt to lump more...let's call them, ""evidenced-based"" practices into the same discussion and attempt to cast a negative light on a broader movement that is growing and has a real chance of success here in the US.  I'm pretty sure if I told the average farmer in my hometown (like my dad) to fill a lactating cow's horn with her own dung and bury it in his field over the winter, I could expect to be promptly escorted to the front gate. And I'm sure Monsanto would relish the opportunity to very publicly point out that these are the types of practices preached by ALL modern sustainable farmers and make us all look ...well, a little silly in the eyes of legislators, decision makers, and the average consumer.  I can hear it now, ""You think these dung worshipers can feed the world?!?!?"".

But please don't get me wrong, biodynamic farming is great!  I'm sure the cow horn thing works just fine as a compost technique; I just don't find it to be necessary to achieve the desired results and Peter's explanation in the film of how it works is anything but scientific or even logical.  However, many ideas overlap with more scientific approaches (whether they indented to or not) and I think the spiritual elements of biodynamics make it a good fit for Indian culture (although I'm neither spiritual nor well versed in Indian culture).  Ha!

Anyway, my apologies for a review focused more on biodynamics in general and less on this particular film.  The film does a wonderful job of documenting the application of biodynamics in a culture likely to accept and adopt it, but let's lose the mysticism for the US market.  Read Joel Salatin and Michael Pollan and watch 'Farmageddon' and 'Dirt! The Movie'.  I believe these sources represent approaches which would be much more well received by the American public.  This whole movement is still in its infancy and, for better or worse, people are watching.  The more we can all get on the same page with more broadly appealing ideas, the better off we will be.",1377216000,7,2743,4.734736842105264

8300980,5,B001F51MEM,"This is an uplifting film about one man's effect on Indian farmers who are stuck in a cycle of debt to chemical companies - since their soil has died from chemical fertilizers. Besides natural techniques introduced to revive the soil and save the farmers - the film shows the power of one individual.  Most of the recent ""Food movies"" are depressing; informative and necessary - yes, but depressing.  This film on the other hand is inspiring and uplifting!  An incredible positive story about a quiet man who goes into action - saves many farmers from ruin, and creates an entire Indian movement.  Peter Coyote does a great job narrating.",1314662400,,638,4.825688073394495
8300981,2,B001F51MEM,"This is a film I was very excited to come across. Unfortunately, the title is misleading. The film has very little to do with a cow. The cow should have been the center of the film, as the cow is the center of the farm. The film completely whiffs in this regard. So much potential, yet such a failure.",1312848000,,301,4.11864406779661
8300982,5,B001F51MEM,"Amidst the destruction of our environment and the tyranny of the corporate model, where Monsanto and Syngenta monopolize the seeds, genetically transformed to resist their pesticides (see also&nbsp;), it is wonderful to watch this documentary.  Biodynamic farming moves away from the corporate model of junk food, and offers food that is healthy to grow, healthy for the environment and healthy to eat.  It is definitively a feel-good movie for those who are really concerned about the fate of the Earth.

Peter Proctor is one of my heroes.  After traveling 25 times to India in 15 years, he finally decides to leave his home country New Zealand and settle there, where he will continue teaching biodynamic farming for the remainder of his days.  He says : ""In biodynamics, the flow of energy is reserved.  It is a profound local alternative to the corporate model of globalization that is incapable of addressing the human need we all share for self-realization and self-determination.""

He is profoundly influenced by Gandhi, who said : ""True democracy cannot be worked by twenty men sitting at the center.  It has to be worked from below by the people of every village"".  At the moment of filming Maharashtra officially had 1.000 organic and biodynamic training programs and more than 4 millions ha under organic or biodynamic cultivation.  And this movement continues to expand very rapidly.",1295222400,8,1395,5.105726872246696
