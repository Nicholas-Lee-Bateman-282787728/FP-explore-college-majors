8088776,5,B000BLRPPQ,"Shortly after his show at the Guggenheim (a 38 year old man).  What I think is interesting is not this short film in and of itself, but you will also need to watch this short footage and then watch Brice 20 years later in Chris Maybach's ""Art City: Making it Manhattan"" (you can buy it alone or with the other Art City DVD's (which are also excellent).  You see quite a contrast in personality. As a 58 year old man in 1996, he is much less affected ""hippy, groovy"" and full of trite observation of art (""this white space could be a piece of a Jackson Pollock line"", you can almost smell the ganja and ouzo and immaturity reek).  In 1996 he is working on his mature line drawings and and you can watch him work and watch his process through the eyes of a mature soul.  We aren't given any bull crap observations about living in two islands (Manhattan and Hydra).  As a result, his working process is original and serious and we gain a sense of the mature artist who is sure of himself but not so sure as to whip out any old drawing.",1133222400,4,1032,4.218274111675127
