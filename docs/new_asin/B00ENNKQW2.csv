5928324,5,B00ENNKQW2,"Sick of attending an all boys school a high school student enrolls in an all girls school that has just been made coed completely unaware of the schools unique curriculum. He quickly discovers that the buxom beauties surrounding him are highly skilled fighters that possess powerful elemental abilities and he must either learn to master his own element or die trying.
Making matters worse his libido keeps getting him into trouble with his beautiful roommates.

The animation and English dub are great, but the series may not appeal to everyone especially those who dislike fan service and harem animes.

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1387152000,19,945,5.051282051282051
5928325,4,B00ENNKQW2,"For Takeru its a dream come true.  An all girls school just going co-ed, his childhood friend has grown up in many ways, all a hormonally charged teenager can dream of.  But on his first day he gets lost to the starting ceremony where he runs into two girls in a knock down - drag down fight using unusual abilites, he tries to stop the fight where he runs into a girl hanging upside down in a tree, who then falls on top of him mouth to mouth.  He then learns that this school teaches special students to use items called Maken and duels are part of the norm.  Add a girl who says she is his finacee, a lot of curvaceous eye candy, and a dark plot to destroy the world - Takeru better learn fast if he is going to survive this.

Overall it is Sekerei light.  There is a plot and good character development, a lot of explosions and shredded clothes, all that a fan of ecchi action can take. I say it is worth the watch and will sit in my collection for a long time to come.",1386028800,19,973,4.041666666666667
5928326,5,B00ENNKQW2,"ive watched this series in sub for a while. and the fans of it here in USA have been hoping for a dub. when discussing it on funimation there was a lot of people hoping for it not to be dubbed, but im glad it was. its a cute story with a pervy boy with a harem, and many moments of fan service. i will buy when price lowers but heres to its dub release in blu ray .",1383868800,2,365,3.632911392405063

5928331,3,B00ENNKQW2,My major complaint about purchasing Maken-ki The complete series is it only had season 1 on it but no season 2!  Whats going on here?,1446249600,,133,4.32
5928332,5,B00ENNKQW2,"Seriously has a decent story. Great art, music and action.  Voice-overs are AHHHHMAZZZINGG!  The English dub is hilarious!  Usually I read the English subtitles and listen to the Japanese as I like the actors they use.  However in the case of Maken-Ki they had great English speaking voice actors!  The episode 02 and 08 had the actors do a voice walk through and they were really funny!  My Wife and I laughed so hard it hurt.  The actors read each other faux love letters and they were so funny!!!  You can preview the first two episodes on Funimation, but the best price is here.

Lots and lots of Fan Service.  Parents search this phrase before you purchase for kids.",1445299200,3,671,4.563025210084033

5928337,3,B00ENNKQW2,"So there's this school named Tenbi Academy that was previously all-girl, but just went coed.  The students there learn how to use some power called an element and each of them is issued a device called a Maken that turns into a unique weapon for that student.  There are like 8 REAL Makens and the rest are artificial or something like that.

 A guy named Takeru enrolls there and his childhood friend Haruko goes there and is a year ahead of him.  Haruko has one of them ""real"" Makens.  Goodie for her.  The students engage in some random duels using their element power and Makens and then 5 girls and a guy from some group called Venus show up.  We don't really know what they're there for.  Then another group of 5 or 6 white-haired kids from an organization named Himagari show up.  They all report to somebody called Grandpa.  Maybe they really are all related.  Who knows.  Anyway, they're like evil and want to take over the school, so the first two groups have a few fights with them.  Uh, that's about all the plot there is.

The whole point of the show is basically that most of the girls have ridiculously large chests, wear extremely short skirts with very tight panties underneath that get exposed whenever they bend over or a slight breeze picks up.  What little clothing they do have on tends to get displaced or shredded during whatever battle is currently underway.  Takeru despite actually rooming with 3 of the girls is frequently involved in some plot to spy on the rest of them.  There is some stuff going on about Takeru having the potential to be really powerful, but we don't know why.

So, this series is just a thin excuse for nearly non-stop fan service.  I don't have a problem with that, but it was just average overall.",1435881600,,1750,4.512738853503185

5928340,2,B00ENNKQW2,"This is my first fanserviced up anime i've bought and there's a certain level of uncomforted and meh. Decent story but it more seems you're here for fanservice. Is there comedy here? Absolutely! Is this a gem that you absolutely need in collection, maybe.
 There are time i was sort of confused is that the school was built for next gen heros and never really made a impact to protect the world from the bad guys, only really at school to stop fights. The lead male with a story that he has, it could have the benefit of having a decent story with the fanservice. Being this is the complete series there were more questions than answer  to the lore and background, which explians why this a complete dvd set, it really doesn't go any with the story like the relationships the lead male has. It just a fanservice series, and the unfortunate part is that there should of been a season 2, to not only give answers, but it's absolutely gorgeous look anime.
Even so, as far fanservice animes come, they seem to get beginning and an end to the plot. This one can't you here, if you more interested in the fanservice just look pics on the internet i guess. 8S",1433203200,,1152,4.403755868544601

Please excuse the limited review since I don't want to give away anything of the series, but I will say:  Get it and be as entertained as I was.",1428105600,,452,4.357142857142857

5928359,5,B00ENNKQW2,if you're looking for a comedy with mildly frequent fan serve this is for you. though the label shows that there is mainly fan serve its more of a comedy series with fan service very now and again. this series has what many have. a loser main character who gets better and better throughout the series with the support of his childhood best friend. worth the watch,1399507200,,364,4.447761194029851

5928363,4,B00ENNKQW2,"Its got a great plot line that isn't used very often. The protagonist has a power that even he doesn't know about, which leads to all kinds of issues. Definitely worth the buy and one that can be watched multiple times",1391644800,,218,4.341463414634147
5928364,4,B00ENNKQW2,"Maken-Ki is a fun, (very) lighthearted comedy first and is a fighting show a way distant second. The fanservice is frequent, but it's all in good fun in this show. Many reviewers are critical of the plot - and I really have no argument - the story isn't anything new or spectacular. You might say it's just another harem. But what Maken-Ki lacks in storyline it more than makes up for with it's heart. The main character is a ton of fun. The supporting cast is as well. Maken-Ki is quite similar to Baka and Test in MANY ways, but still it doesn't feel like a copycat by any means. I'm very glad to have picked this up and would easily recommend it.

- Good script (B+)
- Solid cast (B)",1390780800,12,731,4.258992805755396

8607018,5,B00ENNKQW2,"- Synopsis: Our perverted main character enrolls in a school where the female-to-male ratio is extremely high. As plentiful as the amount of sexy gals and their never-ending curves. However, this is no ordinary school as they train their students to utilize the magical powers of things known as a Maken. Not only is the main character exposed to battles on a daily basis, he also is bombarded by bomb-shells. The good kind. Overall, life is sweet for our perverted main character as he couldn't ask for more.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Great fan-service. This is an ecchi, so it isn't plot-heavy and emphasizes a light-hearted tone and is just meant to take you for a smooth ride. It's also a guilty-pleasure type due lots of panty-shots, nips, and the like.

As such, if you are a viewer that isn't ready or likes heavy fan-service, it's best to stay away from this to save yourself any cringing. There's a lot of whacky situations that helps bring out the comedy from this anime.

The main character is pretty common of these genres: Kind-hearted and attracts the attention of the other ladies to unintentionally add to his harem. Of course he's indecisive like the others and can't pick a waifu. But that's most likely done intentionally so the viewer can use the power of imagination to decide which pairing would be best.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subs. Includes 13 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 13 on 3 DVDs with a runtime of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for some violence, and heavy sexual content. Lots of boobs and eye-candy in general.
===========================================================================================================

- Recommendations: Prison School, Kampfer, Freezing, Cross Ange, Ben-To, Sekirei, Samurai Flamenco, D-Frag!, Binbougami ga!, Mayo Chiki!, and Chobits.",1482624000,3,1923,5.571917808219178

I kept thinking ""Geez, another panty shot, get on with it!""
I was hoping for something more like Sekerei or High School DxD, where the characters were interesting, the plot moves along, and the fan service was at least slightly plausible in context. It was also oddly lacking in comedy, again I was expecting a cheery romp more like ""Cat Planet Cuties"".
The best thing about this was the hysterical voice talent commentary, don't miss it.

8607023,4,B00ENNKQW2,Another title I used to see on Funimation Channel and I recall just recently there's a sequel or second season to this.  Will recommend this to any Anime fan or if you really want to turn heads and stick it to groups like 1 Million Moms then get this it will really scare the Living Daylights out of them as a lot of other Anime with so called moralistic groups like 1 Million Moms.  They think this is like Reefer Madness but for me and all those people with any sense I think those people are really just spouting nonsense.,1453075200,,525,4.24
