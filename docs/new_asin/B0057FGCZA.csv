8460535,3,B0057FGCZA,"This movie was what it was advertised to be. A third rate B movie with the typical monster theme. However, the monster costumes were quite well done even if the storyline was a bit juvenile. The major saving grace for this movie was Shannon Zeller. Her lips alone were worth the purchase price of this B movie.",1323302400,,310,4.456140350877193
