1832000,3,B000089RT0,"Season 7 of THE X FILES (1999-2000) is the last season featuring the original team of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in unmodified form. It is also the weakest of all nine seasons.
NEGATIVE POINTS:
1) Excepting the excellent mythology scripts, Duchovny is emotionally detached in his portrayal of Agent Mulder. While in prior seasons his occasional onscreen fatigue could plausibly be tied to plots featuring a disillusioned Mulder, it is too much of a stretch to extend such a notion to Season 7, which is severely damaged as a result.
2) In terms of new ideas, the writers on the show seemed to have been genuinely stumped throughout much of Season 7, particularly with regard to ""stand alone"" episodes. The numerous uninspired  ""stand alone"" scripts could hardly have been expected to provide the necessary stimulus for a weary Duchovny, struggling through the grind of a notoriously demanding production schedule. The perfunctory interaction between Mulder and Scully in many ""stand alone"" scripts proves especially damaging to a show that thrives on dynamic interplay between its two main characters.
3) Some of the failures relate to the well intentioned but ungainly synthesis attempted by blending THE X FILES with different shows:
The script titled ""Millenium"" features a hackneyed plot (zombies a la George Romero) and is a waste of actor Lance Henriksson's talents. The highly publicized Mulder/Scully ""first kiss"" is anticlimactic, unfittingly placed in such a lackluster episode.
Vince Gilligan's ""X Cops"" tries to merge THE X FILES with the ""reality show"" COPS: a noble failure that works in the first half only to fall to pieces in the second.
4) Other failures had to due with recycling plots and themes from prior years:
""Signs & Wonders"" is a fair effort (a good performance by the guest actor portraying the fiery preacher). Unfortunately, it is too obviously redolent of superior scripts previously penned.
""Orison"", featuring the return of the abominable Donnie Pfaster (""Irresistible""), falls well short of the masterful episode from Season 2. Its closing moments are, however, a tour-de-force with Agent Scully fighting ferociously with Pfaster against the backdrop of David Lynch style cinematography.
""Rush"" is a poorly thought out foray into the world of teenage angst. Equally juvenile is ""First Person Shooter"", a ""virtual reality"" script that completely wastes an appearance by the Lone Gunmen.
5) The most disturbing failures of Season 7 are manifested in three horrible episodes:
""Chimera"" is a unique combination of gaffs with its razor-thin storyline, an uninterested Duchovny (barely in character), bad supporting acting, poor lighting and even a mediocre musical score: an ""anti X FILES"", with all of the series standards turned upside down.
""Hollywood AD"" (written & directed by Duchovny) doesn't even seem to be an X FILES episode. On the surface level, the script plays in territory previously staked out by Darin Morgan, but ""Hollywood AD"" falls well short of the inspired shifting perspectives offered in ""Jose Chung's `From Outer Space' "".  With its pedestrian version of ironic juxtaposition (the ""converted radical"" & ""apostate traditionalist"") ""Hollywood AD"" swerves between chic absurdity and ""hipper than thou"" movie-star smarminess, a combination completely antithetical to the spirit of THE X FILES.
Chris Carter's ""Fight Club"" is an essay in bitterness, all too reflective of the turmoil playing out behind the scenes. With this singularly unpleasant episode THE X FILES bottomed out, sinking to a depth of self-loathing that nearly destroyed it altogether.
POSITIVE POINTS:
1) Unique scripts, so often seen in previous years, were few and far between in Season 7 but ""All Things"" (written and directed by Gillian Anderson) is an artfully prepared piece; ""outside the box"" but retaining a sense of continuity and fidelity to the life and character of Dana Scully.
2) Vince Gilligan's ""Hungry"" is a beautifully conceived black comedy, shown (sympathetically) from the point of view of a quirky ""anti-villian"".
3) Other episodes fit more readily into the ""classic"" X FILES mould. ""Theef"" and ""Brand X"" feature catchy dialogue and ""gross out"" situations that could have comfortably been aired in  Season 2. These scripts, while not meeting the Olympian standards set in the ""glory years"", have the effect of shoring up the more disastrous areas of the season by working in familiar territory.
MYTH ARC:
The heart and soul of Season 7 is located in the six mythology episodes, which feature the type of committed acting and thoughtful writing fans have come to expect from THE X FILES ( the newly invigorated myth-arc plot plus the ongoing Scully/Mulder ""symbiosis"" would carry the dramatic weight of the show in its final years ).
The opening two-parter (""The Sixth Extinction I/II"") borrows an important element of its plot from the Nikos Kazantzakis novel, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".
The mid season two-parter (""Sein und Zeit"" / ""Closure"") follows up and (apparently) ends the mystery surrounding Mulder's quest for his sister. ""Closure"" features an incredibly moving performance by Duchovny (one of his finest moments on the show). ""My Weakness"", a song written by pop artist Moby, plays a haunting musical role in the episode.
""En Ami"" (co-written by William B. Davis), while not at the same level as the other mythology episodes, does feature some interesting dialogue between Agent Scully and the Cigarette Smoking Man. The amoral brilliance of the Machiavellian ""CGB Spender"" is an interesting contrast to the noble goodness of the equally intelligent Dana Scully.
The cliffhanger (""Requiem"") is full of dramatic tension, bringing the agents back to the location first featured in the 1993 series ""Pilot"". This excellent and influential episode (the plot launched a dozen more scripts) was a noble conclusion to the troubled 7th season and helped put THE X FILES back on a path worthy of its unique quality; the show would ultimately ( though not without missteps) fulfill its 9 year run as an aesthetic and philosophical unity.",1043798400,62,6092,5.258992805755396
1832001,5,B000089RT0,"...P>Mulder and Scully were still together for this, their last season as the two leading characters of one of the best dramatic series in television history.
After the movie, the move to L.A. and the predominance of humorous episodes throughout the Sixth Season and the incredible resolution of the original mythology, the seventh season started with a bang but not with a little anxiety on the fans' side because this was the much rumored final season. ...
Myth Episodes:
The Seventh Season starts with the two parts of a new mythology that started with the last episode of Season Six called Biogenesis.
The Sixth Extinction and The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati (Wich translated means ""Love Of Fate"")carry on with the theory that Mulder might be a succesful Human - Alien Hybrid!!!
It's extremely important that you don't miss the Two Parter:
Sein Und Zeit (Wich means ""Being and Time"") and Closure wich puts to rest, in an extremely precious form, the Samantha Mulder mistery giving the Fox Character one of his few moments of rest throughout the whole series.
And Requiem... The best of the best in Season Finale's. Although it would ultimately lead the series into only God knows what.
Stand Alone Episodes (Or Monster of the Week):
Orison:
Witnesses the return of a villain that appeared before in earlier seasons. Great script by Chip Johanessen (Former collaborator of Beverly Hills 90210 and Millenium).
The Amazing Maleeni:
Actually not an X File, but an excellent proof that the series still had a lot of fuel. Excellent Turn of Screw at the end!!!
X Cops:
Cops, The X Files and Vince Gilligan... What's not to like?
Theef:
Voodoo. Nuff Said!!!
Chimera:
David Amann at his best!!!
En Ami (Wich means ""One Friend"", although its a play on words wich in english can be understood as ""enemy""):
Written by the CSM himself (William B. Davis)!!!
All Things:
Written and Directed by Gillian Anderson. Not the best, but the teaser (considered one of the most controversials in the whole series' existence) is worth the whole package.
Je Souhaite (I Wish):
Written and directed by Vince Gilligan.
After this, the series was transformed into a mix up that even Chris Carter didn't understand at all. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate Robert Patrick's character or even Annabeth Gish's but John Dogget and Monica Reyes didn't achieve to give the series that feeling we all know very well. That X FILES feeling.
I'm so sorry that David Duchovny got transformed into such an egotistical person. The series would have been succesful with him in it. You can see him act like a Zombie (Check out Chimera)and he already looks tired. Maybe the series would've finished here and continue in a new movie. Heck! The series could've even ended with Season Eight, but no! Fox had to continue exploiting fans. And we gladly let them... But not for long.
Hope you enjoy having the only and real seven seasons of what can be called the television phenomenon of the last century.
I WILL buy the las two seasons, only to feed my collectionist's hunger, and because the movie will start where the last episode of the Ninth (and worst season) left off.
Long Live the X Files!!!
Long Live the X Philes!!!
Wishing to encounter you all again in a dark cinema room.

There's a lot of great TV here just like the previous 6 seasons.  Go in in with an open mind and if you've been binging up to this point, you may want to take a break for a week and let give yourself a well needed rest.  I think most of the criticism of this season comes from those that are still feeding off the incredible ride that Season 6 is.  Season 6 is definitely better than 7. But 7 is in NO WAY bad work.

The effects and production quality improved and the stories, with all the twists and turns remain interesting. Season 7 contains one of my favorite episodes, 'First Person Shooter'. One that is more light and light-hearted than many. The boy in males comes out in Mulder. This is also about the time that the producer began indulging the stars and their writing and directing aspirations, with mixed results.

1832281,5,B000089RT0,"Many of the episodes represent an interesting divergence from the more traditional storylines of seasons 1-5. Not to be missed is the David Duchovny penned ""The Sixth Extinction: Amor Fati,"" the inspiration for which was the novel, ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" You'll also certainly want to check out Hungry, Signs and Wonders, the meta-humorous X-Cops and Hollywood AD, and Sein Und Zeit/Closure- the last of which is the presumed ending of the Samantha storyline. Requiem, the season finale, is the jumping-off point for the mythology arc of the final two seasons- which while uneven, makes more sense on a second or third watch. Je Souhaite is a cute, very sweet episode that ends the Mulder/Scully era on a high note, and serves as a natural stopping point if you're uninterested in the Mulder abduction arc, or the Dogget/Reyes partnership of the eighth and ninth seasons. Overall, this season is a lot more flippant and whimsical than the grimness of earlier seasons, but still has a lot of interesting things to say about Mulder, Scully, and the intersection of humanity and all things weird.",1429488000,2,1103,5.0

1832377,5,B000089RT0,"Closure was a wonderful episode. It closed the file on Samantha in a heartfelt manner.
Season 7 was one which I closely followed when it was first aired. I never thought it to be a bad season and enjoyed most episodes. However, there were a few which seemed to be out-of-place when you think of the previous 6 seasons. This is not to say that the efforts were lacking, as each episode over all 9 years of this remarkable series were given the proper production and seriousness deserving of any seminal action.
I sometimes go back to my favorites to refresh myself in this fantastic TV series. A number of episodes are tops for me, most from Seasons 1-5, but Season 6, 7, 8 and 9 are also able to emit from me a desire to revisit these episodes and enjoy them even though I have seen them before. The acting, production (from all angles), writing and general casting were superb for every episode of this wonderful series.
While Closure could have been the end of the series in that Mulder's objective was to find his sister, and was able to lift the viewer as well, there were a lot of loose ends which needed to be explained, if the producers were to end this series.
Ignoring the behind-the-scenes contractual and legal issues, everyone involved in the series continued to give it their best each and every week. This series is only one of a very few which could be considered feature films each and every week. The amount of attention given to the visual and sound effects were as magnificent and believable at the end as they were in the beginning.
Closure is a fine example of this series and what it brought to TV audiences: entertainment.",1407801600,,1645,4.523489932885906

This episode brings closure to the Millennium television series which closed shop rather suddenly, leaving many fans of both series without so much as a clue as to agent Black's fate after he walked away from the bureau as well as his own share of the supernatural.

This season is a return to more of the 'monster of the week' format that began the show, and does less of the over-arching alien takeover theme that interspersed with the other episodes. It takes Scully and Mulder's relationship a bit further, but also doesn't reveal alot about it. Just hints at a more intimate relationship.

I cant watch Amazon prime on android because it uses silverlight and that isn't supported on Android. So I had to watch it on a small screen which was disappointing. I am a developer and not a fan of silverlight is there a way to use some other technology that is more standard in the browser?

1832417,3,B000089RT0,"Because this is the x files ,  you expect so much from this show that only greatness will do. that' is unrealistic. this was a mainly solid season with a few weaker episodes. But a weak episode of this show is like a weaker beatles song. IT's still good.  You could sense a decline here as the show was going on. they had way too many humorous episodes that were just silly. If they had done less of those no one would complain. but those eps like the genie one were still entertaining. Obviously they alternated way too much between serious and lighthearted for some people's taste , and to be honest I would have like more serious ones.  But they rebounded next season to complete greatness again. Still fans should enjoy this  season as it's typical x files , with lots of monsters and sci fi stuff. The video game episode was the weakest of the season but it still has the lone gunmen in it , so that helps.  The lovely mimi Rodgers was in a few eps as well. On dvd this looks decent and it was shot in widescreen by this time. So the one star reviewer is wrong.  There is even a good fox crossover episode with cops.  Which lasted on the air for almost 30 years? and may still be on some network.  SO if you are fan , you will enjoy this one. Probably most of it as much as the past eps and seasons. But some of it is more tongue in cheek than past efforts. Which angered a few viewers.  NOt me , and the next season returned this show to the top.",1388534400,,1452,4.120567375886525

Mulder is hospitalized 3 times - multiple snake bites, several episodes where his body shuts down due to some weird phenomenon, and tobacco beetle eggs in the lungs. Santa Claus murders 24 children. We learn of the fate of Mulder's sister - not happy. Lots of sad and unhappy things happen to Mulder from here on out. He gets experimented on several times - by humans, then aliens. His mother dies. He dies, then comes back to life. Then he gets chased out of town with death threats. David Duchovney basically leaves the show. There are still some good stand alone shows that do not involve an ongoing conspiracy or plot. Season 7 Mulder is in nearly every episode, but boy do we put Mulder though the ringer. As well, we start to see a shift from Mulder the case cracker to Scully the case cracker. Must be they knew even before Season 7 began that David Duchovney wanted to leave. Season 8 he is in half of the episodes, as he spends the other half underground. Season 9, he is only in the concluding show. What's my point?

1832450,4,B000089RT0,"This is the last season where Mulder and Scully are partnered throughout and as such, many consider it the last true season of X Files. Many fans felt it should have been the last season altogether. The great thing about the seventh season is that so much is wrapped up that it could actually serve well as the series' finale. True, it leaves a few big questions unanswered and even ends on a cliffhanger but the season works hard to conclude much of Mulder's character threads, his sister's abduction chief among them, and provides a good deal of closure to the character.

The two epsiode thread focusing on Mulder's sister is really great, as is 'En Ami,' a really interesting episode where Scully and The Smoking Man take a road trip and we get to learn a bit more about the infamous villain. However, the best is the season finale and the particularly wonderful acting between the two lead characters, it's rather bittersweet since we know the end to their seven-year partnership is near.

The weakest part of the season is that it lacks a major alien-conspiracy story arc, it having effectively ended the season prior, and therefore doesn't build well. Key characters are brought back, some of which I didn't think would be seen again, and there are a few great mythology episodes but it just feels as if Chris Carter tried unsuccessfully to construct another elaborate conspiracy tale but ran out of time or substance. Perhaps the alien colonization tale that ran throughout the first six seasons and the titular movie was just so well done that it couldn't be matched.

Still, what does remain of the mythology is interesting and will want to be seen by fans and Carter does do an admirable job of concentrating on the stand-alone/monster-of-the-week episodes (my favorites being 'All Things' which was written and directed by Gillian Andersen herself, 'X-Cops' and 'Je Souhaite').

The bottom line is that season seven has to be seen by fans because it answers some big very questions and more importantly, it marks the end of possibly the greatest TV/film duo in history. Even at their weakest, Mulder and Scully are still better than most.",1367107200,,2150,4.834239130434782

It has some great stand-alone episodes, though, and I love that they kept everything relatively normal until Mulder got abducted. The Amazing Maleeni is very entertaining; Signs and Wonders was very intelligently written. X-Cops is a wonder - I loved the combination of ""reality"" and staged TV. Chimera, all things, and Hollywood AD were also great, with all of them making fun and insightful allusions to the Mulder-Scully romance, and Je Souhaite is one of my favorite episodes ever.

1832461,5,B000089RT0,"I thought this The X-Files Season 7 was very interesting. Be aware that the producers of X-Files are pro-Catholic.
REASON,EMOTION,TRUTH:
Christmas (Mass of Christ) was created by the sexually perverted Roman Catholic church. The Catholic church (Mother of Harlots) was created by Satan. The book of Revelations explains. Why do most non-Catholics, and many Christians, celebrate this wildly wicked weird witchcraft holiday from the weathered Roman religion of rapists? It's beautiful side of evil?...Well, evil, is still evil, no matter how it is served to you. Why do people keep defending their betrayers?

Satan is an evil fallen angel that created carnal religions to enslave people's minds and all carnal religions are a scam. To be a follower of the only true God Jesus Christ is not a ""religion""...it is a relationship a relationship with the One who created you and me. Christians (the church) are the body of believers, not a building made of materials from a hardware store. Study world history. You then will have a frame of reference. The Catholic church is not Christian it was created by Satan.

People you need to stop being willfully ignorant about the HOLY BIBLE, world history and the evil side of human nature. God explains in the HOLY BIBLE about telling His people the Israelites to use weapons to defend themselves against the evil pagans. Read or listen (on the Internet) all of the HOLY BIBLE, then you will have a frame of reference to the facts I am sharing here.

The Lord God creates, and He takes. People's flesh and emotions are meant to suffer on this Earth. There is a purpose for this sadness.

HISTORY TRUTH:
Any document that claims to be giving me accurate information historically I am a skeptic, not a cynic, but a skeptic. That is why I have four tests I consistently use on any document that claims to be giving me accurate historical information. My four test are: 1) Literary Style. 2) Internal Consistency. 3) Archaeological Evidence. 4) Manuscript Evidence. If you don't like my tests come up with your own tests to determine historical facts.

1832462,2,B000089RT0,"This is a great show up until season 7 comes along.  It destroys the previous six seasons buildup of the main plot and goes haywire.  The seventh season becomes new agey, metaphysical, and religious.  I never did like the idea that a by the book scientist, like Scully is supposed to be, would be a Christian but I put up with it because the overall plot was still good but this season takes and changes the fundamental designs of the characters.  Any scientist worth anything would know about Arthur C. Clarkes three laws of technology which would put Scully in a very strange position to judge the scientific evidence she discovers during investigations as silly but still believe in God.  For Mulder to go on a metaphysical journey to the world of lost children to find his sister is just destructive to the premise of the show.  I hope they can turn this show around and get it back on track in season 8 because this is asinine.  You could skip this whole season and not miss anything.",1348617600,2,989,4.522471910112359
1832463,5,B000089RT0,"This season is one of my favorites, maybe my favorite. The actors that portray Mulder, Scully, and Skinner appear very comfortable in their roles and the interplay between the actors and characters is excellent. This season is one of my favorite because there are a higher percentage of weird or odd episodes compared to that of conspiracy episodes. This season includes the episodes Hungry, Rush, The Amazing Maleeni, Signs & Wonders, X-Cops, First Person Shooter, Chimera, Brand X, Fight Club, and Je Souhaite. Many of these help to enhance the relationships between Skinner, Mulder and Scully. Scully and Mulder's relationship strengthens.

SPOILERS (Alert):

This season seemingly wraps the story of the two partners Mulder and Scully. It brings resolution and explanation to his sister's disappearance (or at least Mulder's acceptance to it) and the story full circle--back to where they started--together in Oregon investigating the same group of kids from the first/Pilot episode. The season includes an explanation of the sacrifice the syndicate made with the Aliens, moreover wrapping the story of the syndicate for as well as we know. The story also removes CSM from the picture as well as explaining quite a bit from Mulder's past (or is it? Is it just his dream?). This season has the most developed romantic relationship between the two main characters thus far (to which my wife loves).

Genius, though the end is obviously predictable.

The resolution (if one can call it that) of Mulder's raison d'tre is horrible, and no real end at all for such a strong storyline.  To never meet his sister after all of this time was a ripoff, IMO, just one of many perped by Carter.",1339286400,,721,4.480916030534351

I have a crush on Agent Scully/Gillian Anderson.  There were so many parallels in this one that I thought this contained a message tailored for me.

You get drawn in by the characters and feel part of their lives and situations.  Chris Carter, the creator of the show, changed TV viewing of what a sci-fi series could be. I was in awe, laughed until it hurt, dumbfounded by plots, emotional about the relationships and adored the actors.  Now that I've bought every single season, I can relive it over and over, again.

Season 7 was the beginning of the end.

1832478,5,B000089RT0,"""Orison"" is a serious step in a mixed season.  The episode tells the story of Reverend Orison (a name that conveniently also doubles for the word ""prayer""), a prison preacher who has a murderous past.  Orison preaches God's ""glory"" to his captive parishioners, while aiding in the release and/or escape of select prisoners from the maximum security facility in which he serves.  Through a specialized surgical procedure, Orison manages to control his physical environment.  All is well, until Orison comes up against dangerous ""X-Files"" recidivist, Donnie Pfaster.  Pfaster, a dangerous necrophiliac last seen in season 2's ""Irresistible,"" proves an almost impossible nut to crack for Orison, whose abilities seem limited in the wake of Pfaster's prison escape and undaunted violence.

Our heroes, Mulder and Scully, are injected into the story when Pfaster's escape begins to haunt Scully.  Continuing his fixation on Dana Scully, we see Scully - once again - violently confronted with Pfaster.  The episode depicts one of the most explicit scenes of physical violence involving one of the X-Files' central characters.  In a largely light-hearted season, ""Orison"" stands out as an exercise in physical horror.  Not until the final scenes of the episode is the audience allowed to contemplate the larger theme of ""evil"" which pervades each scene.

""Orison"" is not the first or last time the X-Files dealt with the nature of evil in it's tenure.  However, it is one of the few times when this theme is not immediately attached to the supernatural.  Donnie Pfaster is portrayed as a physical demon, but he is ultimately and undoubtedly a human man who personifies the penchant for violence and evil which exists in humanity.  The episode is an addictive display of humanity in one of our most obsequious and violent states.",1271635200,,1821,5.170648464163823

1832488,3,B000089RT0,"I love X-Files, but truly season 7 is the weakest so far, have no idea if it gets any worse in later seasons. There are several reasons why I just couldn't enjoy it as much as previous seasons.

With the destruction of the Syndicate and all previous mytharcs dropped, the new arc started in the last episode of season 6 just didn't play out well in first 2 episodes of season 7. This story line has gotten so much out of control and became so ""philosophical,"" I simply couldn't understand what was going on. Same goes for ""The Closure"" episode which was supposed to finally end the mystery of Samantha Mulder's disappearance. It certainly didn't give me much closure except for confirming Samantha was in fact dead. What was ""En Ami"" about anyway? I liked last episode of the season, some brilliance from past seasons came back, but I felt that story deserved more screen time. Considering that this episode was meant to be the last of the show, it sure was a cliffhanger.

The handling of the relationship between Scully and Mulder was really irritating. I don't mind the idea of a platonic relationship between these two, but why then inject the unnecessary teasers and allude to their being intimate without actually confirming it? There is only so much teasing I can take. Also, why was Scully so depressed most of this season? She was so sad majority of the time, I just wanted to quit.

Finally, there were not that many truly good episodes that we came to love. Too many episodes had emotional and philosophical instead of regular investigative content. It doesn't mean I hated this season, but it definitely was way below the par.",1242000000,2,1638,4.680555555555555

I'm also a ""Fringe"" fan and The X files started it on fox. Millennium tried but some idiot(s)decided it wasn't any good (but it was the best TV show with Lance Henrickson's best work). Check out Millenium.

If you have not seen the X Files, Check out the series. The regular ""filler episodes"" outside the alien conspiracy are just as fun. They are stand alone mini-movies. In my opinion, the reason why the X Files films did not do so well is because they already used the same quality for the TV show.

Bouncing back from the heavilly comedic season 6, S7 is perhaps the most self-aware and somber of the series. Here, Mulder and Scully have basically conquered the alien conspiracy and defeated their primary enemy. So what's left? Self exploration is the tone of this season, Mulder looks inward to find what really happened to his sister, and the answer is quite inspiring (if a bit too in tune with new age sentimentality). Scully looks back and forward as she see's her life with Mulder and where that might eventually take her. Even the so-called Cigarette Smoking Man has a crisis of faith as he considers what legacy he leave's behind after he dies. So in truth, this season is about tieing up lose character ends, not story points.

1832495,5,B000089RT0,"I've been rewatching some of the old X-Files episodes in anticipation of the movie. These slim pack versions of the X-Files finally came down enough in price for them to be within my financial reach at one of the discount chains. As ever, I find myself doing a lot of skipping around. I never did much care for the myth-arc episodes or the dreadful, pretentious voice overs at the beginning of those episodes that I presume Chris Carter wrote. I liked even less the lack of attention to character continuity from episode to episode. What was bad about the X-Files was bad in this season and what was good about the show was very good here. We have awful, pretentious voice overs and confusing, muddled myth-arc stuff in ""The Sixth Extinction"" and ""Amor Fati"" and somewhat in ""En Ami."" I think the writers had written themselves into a corner and were scrambling to tie up loose ends before David Duchovny was no longer under contract. It showed, particularly in the way they tried to wrap up the Samantha story arc in ""Sein Und Zeit"" and ""Closure."" No one knows what the heck happened to Samantha and the walk-in story line didn't make any more sense on viewing six years or so after I last watched it. It does make a certain amount of emotional sense and it was nice to see Mulder embracing the ghost of the 14-year-old Samantha in the final scene. Just try not to think too hard while watching this episode or see all the holes in the plot. I ended up fast-forwarding a lot through that episode to the scenes I liked and ignoring the ones I didn't. There are a few gems in this season. ""X-Cops"" is still hilarious, almost as good as ""Bad Blood"" from the fifth season, which I still rewatch when I need a boost in mood. ""Hollywood A.D."" and ""Je Souhaite"" are also very nice stand-alone episodes. ""Millennium"" is great, if only because I liked the TV series and it was nice to see Frank Black in that last scene with his little girl and the Mulder-Scully kiss. No, the world didn't end. Too bad Chris Carter didn't figure that out a few seasons before that. Best of all is ""all things,"" the episode written and directed by Gillian Anderson. The amount of thought that went into every scene, every sound, into every move made by every character, was very evident. I also appreciated the comments made by the actress that accompany this episode. I remember thinking ""Yeah, that's probably why she did such and such"" when I first watched it eight years ago and it's nice to know that I was right. It also helped that the music was easy on the ears and the decor was easy on the eyes. I liked her take on Scully as a complete human being, one who acted in certain ways and had conflicting feelings about spirituality and religion and Mulder and her old love Daniel. It's really a pity that Anderson wasn't given a chance to write more episodes. And of course this was the episode where Scully and Mulder slept together and probably where William was conceived. Since I watch more for character development and the relationships between the characters, this episode is a real jewel, but this DVD is worth purchasing for fans of all persuasions, those who like the myth-arc and those who don't.",1216771200,3,3188,4.546086956521739
1832496,5,B000089RT0,An outstanding season for an outstanding series. Still one of the most creative series ever to appear on TV.,1199491200,3,108,4.7368421052631575
1832497,4,B000089RT0,"Ive been trying to keep some kind of record of each episode of the x-files (of which there were nine seasons) for some time now but with little success. This is a geeky thing for me to do firstly because of the series itself (sci fi, alien abductions anyone?) and also just trying to provide a summary for a show that had some 180 plus episodes is a little bit obsessive. The problem seems to be that I put on an episode (I have alot of time because I am now unemployed yes?) and then I potter around, fix a coffee, my hair, my lunch and have no idea as to what's gone on with the aliens. I can just about remember whether what Ive seen is either a 'mythological' or 'stand alone' episode. Mythological tales begun with Fox Mulder's sister being abducted by non- humans when he was a child and then general alien related stories which always effect Mulder and Dana Scully is some emotional and physical way. Stand alone episodes are about everything elses and can be silly, funny, ironic, frightening, complicated, dull; you get the point. They are always resloved in the same episode.

I'm currently watching Season 7 and have worked my way here starting with season 1 in season order. I watched the first 5 seasons when they originally aired. Looking at them now they seem dated and crude; the chemistry between Mulder and Scully which is really the defining point of the show, undeveloped. By season 6 I'd begun to actually stop experimenting with my hair and was sitting down watching the show. When I took out season 7 from the box I realised that I already knew many of the episodes from title and was very familiar to the plots and had enjoyed many of the episodes already. See our heros had really begun to fully inhabite their charaters and the emotional dynamic between the two had well truly taken off.  I think this season is also the one in which Mulder leaves, to come back only for those 'Myth' episodes and the series final. So a beautifully acted season, funny and engaging and fully realised.",1199404800,2,2010,4.519230769230769
1832498,5,B000089RT0,Some people think the X-files went down hill after Season 6. I bought season 7 with some misgivings. After a weak start with the brain attack episodes the series goes back to its original premise (unraveling the para-normal) with some brilliant and often funny episodes. This season is well worth buying.,1188691200,6,304,4.980392156862745
1832499,5,B000089RT0,"As a long time fan of the show I thought it opportune to revisit the show and collect every season on DVD.  I had recollected such intricasies in the constantly evolving plot lines that I had to pinpoint as an adult.  Not only that, I felt it redeeming to watch each episode in order to witness progress of the storyline.  The seventh season of X-Files is hands down a great set of dvd's to own, all the seasons are.  The X-files is the best science fiction show ever created.  But in particular, this season's evolving plot lines somewhat dry out.  There are characters, bad guys if you will, that seem to be missing from the previous seasons.  Over time these characters appeared more and more to be essential in Mulder's quest for the truth.  Chris Carter refers to his original ongoing plot lines as ""mythologies"".  The alien mythologies are somewhat left out and critical elements are exposed and Mulder doesn't seem to care
to follow those points up.  The show however had reached it's cinematographic best and special effects were very well done.  The appearance (color, panning, frames per second) were really nailed to give the show a very intriguing, yet subtle feel.  If you were to choose between buying one or two movies as oppose to a slim set season of X-Files, I would go with this show because overall it really keeps you wanting more, which it winds up giving you.

1832500,5,B000089RT0,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements since the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Season V actually has the bonus disc in with actual holder itself. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making an average of 25 episodes for most seasons. Some seasons have more or less than this figure. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. This season is in Widescreen 1.78:1

X-Files: Season seven is full of Special Agent Mulder but effectively he leaves the X Files at the end of this season only to make guest star appearances in the next two seasons, so this is the last season to see Mulder  full-time. Season seven begins with Mulder facing a problem of an extraterrestrial telepathy that threatens his life. Scully is off trying to discover the meaning of life in terms of new facts that have presented themselves in religion and biology. A whole pile of questions concerning the alien agenda are answered in the first few episodes and what happened to Mulder's sister. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is back along with Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) make a few shows. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) makes a return. Special Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) is dead as is Agent Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Season seven of the X-Files is mostly about - Alien hegemony, telepathy, mutants, luck, Millennium's Frank Black, speed, demons, magicians, Christian snake handling, Mulder's sister, reality TV, computer games, celtic voodoo, cure for cancer, wild women, love, Hollywood, tobacoo, fighting, genies and Mulder's abduction. This Season changes to try and provide a new type of humour halfway through and so the style changes along with the X files / Cops hybrid show and the mixing in of Millennium (You may want to see all of Millennium before you watch this Season as it ended before Season 7). Season 7 has a lot to offer. Of course it really all hinges on the two episodes `Closer' about Mulder's Sister and Mulder's finale in `Requiem'. Season 7 is probably the oddest of the Seasons because of the pace changes and David Duchovny resigning himself for only guest star roles in the last two Seasons (apparently he wanted to do other things). It is sad to think that this is the end to Spooky and we have enjoyed being with him now for a run of 7 Seasons which lasted 7 years. Still he does show up in the other two Seasons so pressing on we still want to find out what Dana has yet to uncover about alien conspiracy in Season 8 without the Fox.",1184112000,2,5629,4.696356275303644
1832501,4,B000089RT0,"Season 7 picks up right where the Season 6 finale left off in a three parter.  That means that it continues the same confusing and sometimes ridiculous plot of that finale.  It seems those writing these three episodes started to write the first things that came to mind instead of what the actual best direction for the story would've been.  That said, many people believe the series started to decline here; I disagree.  The only thing that's really a letdown is the amount of mythology episodes.  There are only 4 or 5.  It's sort of hard to say much about the mythology direction that this season goes.  There is a two-parter where Mulder finally figures out what happens to his sister, resulting in one of the most poignantly filmed moments in the series.  Other than that, very little new information is given by the mythology episodes.  Fortunately, the season finale, Requiem, takes things back to the basics for the mythology and ends up being one of the best (if not the best) episodes in the season.  There is really no appearance at all of ""the black oil"" and very little appearances by the Cigarette Smoking Man.  Mulder and Scully become a lot closer together in this season, but it's mainly through the stand alone episodes, which began to outweigh the merit of the mythology episodes around season 6.  Most of them are just great, like Hungry, which is from the perspective of the monster, and David Duchovney's hilarious Hollywood A.D.  Gillian Anderson's ""all things"" is a very good episode as well about Scully reflecting on her choices in life.  And the bad episodes like the horribly written First Person Shooter and the irritating Fight Club are here as usual.  This season CONTAINS THE SPECIAL FEATURES just like in season 6.  They are on the same disc as the last two episodes here.

1832504,5,B000089RT0,"I wanted to point out something technical about the slim set discs that I bought.  If you're looking for insight into the episodes or characters - please look elsewhere.

When I put the first disc of Season One into my DVD player, it started the ""loading"" process and gave me a disc error after about one minute.  Instead of cursing Fox (well, I did it later anyway) I turned the player off, leaving the disc inside.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my DVD player on and Viola!  I heard the X-Files theme and saw the menus (after the obligatory FBI copyright infringement warnings).

For those wondering, the DVD player in question above is a Philips Progressive Scan.  The same problem occurred on a newer Panasonic player.  No glitches materialized when I tried the discs on the Sony or AKAI players.  In all cases, I was eventually able to get to the episodes.  With the first two the screen sometimes showed up scrambled and the menus inaccessible.  On other occasions I was able to access a root menu similar to one you would see if you ""explore"" the DVD contents on a PC (Video_TS files, etc.), though the players would not load any content from these menus.  Speaking of PC viewing, I experienced no problems with any of the discs on my PC and all four programs my PC has to play DVDs functioned perfectly.

PLEASE DON'T READ INTO THIS TOO MUCH.  I don't work for Fox - I'm not trying to encourage sales of the more expensive sets.  This was just a personal experience I had, and it seemed to occur less frequently with Seasons 4 - 9.  My uneducated opinion: the equipment I have isn't top of the line, and maybe wasn't equipped to handle the way the content was compressed.  I was impressed that 4, sometimes 5 episodes were squeezed on one disc.  That's three - almost four hours of content.  I know - dual layer DVDs and blah, blah, blah.  But c'mon - even Lord of the Rings - Return of the King was issued on 2 discs!  (By the way, the content looked and sounded great.)

Another side note: Seasons 1 - 4 that I got were full frame, and 5 - 9 are widescreen.  At first I thought I had missed the option when purchasing these discs, but these are the only way I've found them at retail stores and online.  Nothing major; I just thought I was losing my mind at first.  (Which is still a possibility.)  I can't remember if they aired this way on television - I just noticed that the cinematography got revved up a bit starting with Season 5.  If this observation is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.

Okay.  If you have read this entire review give yourself a pat on the back, a cookie, I dunno - watch some old Doctor Who episodes or something.  A better price, better packaging, and better for you.  (They were giving out a carton of Morley's with the bigger sets, right?)  By the way - the 5 stars is based on my overall X-Files enjoyment.  Sure, there are episodes I can skip through.  But for me, it's good bang for the buck.  Enjoy!",1172361600,,2967,4.381651376146789

And therefore will not be at the mercy of trying to catch my faves on reruns.  Season seven includes my all-time favorite episode, FIRST PERSON SHOOTER, where Scully and Mulder are lured into a virtual reality game where a rogue program femme fatale is murdering gamers.  Also, ALL THINGS, which starts out with Scully getting dressed and leaving the sleeping Mulder's apartment.  Come on, you know you love it.",1169856000,2,528,4.706521739130435
1832507,5,B000089RT0,"So for about $35 compared to the earlier set price of $90, I'm getting better packaging, and I won't get the extra disc of bonus materials that the sets come packaged with. Um, I think I'll go ahead and get the new reissues.

I got lucky and purchased the original first season box set for less than $40 right here on Amazon. The packaging for these more expensive sets are downright atrocious. It's one of those fold out thingies that are annoying to unfold completely when you just want to get to one disc. I felt like I was trying to take apart complicated origami everyttime I opened the set. I think if you open the whole thing up completely, it's about the length of a pool table.

Now with these new sets, the discs come in individual slipcases, minimizing wear and tear on the box itself and making it loads easier to get the specific disc that you want to watch. Also, the bonus stuff wasn't really that in depth and I can do without it. Considering that you're getting better packaging with these new reissues, it's almost like you're paying upwards of $50 just to get some behind the scenes info on a show that is even better with the less you know about it.

At any rate, I'd suggest going with these new sets, unless you absolutely have to have the extra disc of features. The transfers are top notch and best of all, you can relive all your favorite episodes of Mulder and Scully for a much more reasonable price.",1168732800,2,1427,4.3977272727272725
1832508,5,B000089RT0,"I loved the X-Files. When I watched it weekly on Sunday night, I never got the feeling that I was watching a glorified soap opera. Now, I am ordering the series by year. I've just finished season seven viewing one episode per evening. My review could be applied to the six previous seasons as well.

Think about it! How often were Mulder and Scully and Skinner at deaths door only to be revived at the last possible moment.

Plus, if you had incontrovertible evidence that earth was about to be invaded by aliens why would you work on the more mundane cases? Wouldn't you devote every moment trying to battle to save earth?

The stand alone episodes are excellent. I loved them the most even though I really watched the series for the ""Black Oil"" stories.

However, I think that Chris Carter could not figure out a way to tie up all the loose ends, so he just dropped the ball at the end.

Mulder left the show after season seven (to go on to a fantastic movie career -- read that with dripping sarcasm.) While Scully bravely ventured on with Doggett?, the actor from Terminator II. I thought he was a great choice because, after all, he came from the future.

Finally, I also purchased the ""Lone Gunmen"" series from Amazon.com and found it to be good as well. The first show about the World Trade Towers is downright bizarre.

I'm going to purchase seasons eight and nine because I tend to be a completist. I loved the X-Files, but after watching every show on consecutive evenings, it really was somewhat of a Sci-Fi soap opera.",1164412800,9,1530,4.501805054151625
1832509,5,B000089RT0,"There is a huge lack of info regarding the special features on the slimpack rereleases of the X-Files seasons around the net.  After reading reviews on this site, I concluded that the slimpack releases removed the bonus features entirely, along with removing the bonus discs.  Since I feel that season 7 is the worst of the seasons (besides maybe 9), I bought the cheaper slimpack edition of it (while buying the original versions of the other 8 seasons).  Much to my surprise, it contained all of the bonus features, including ""the truth about season 7,"" which I had heard was not on it (and isn't advertised on the outside packaging of the set!).

Thus, I can only conclude that the slimpacks actually contain all the bonus features from the special editions, unless there is a disc which contains exclusively bonus material (as in the case of season 9, which had two discs worth of bonus material - the slimpack edition has two fewer discs than the special edition). Season 7 definitely does, anyway.  Thus, I recommend that everyone who has an interest in owning season 7 just buy this edition, as the packaging is vastly superior and it actually is not missing the bonus material.

For an actual review of the season, I'll say again that this is my least favorite season.  There is an inordinate number of just completely lame episodes like X-Cops, Hollywood AD, Rush (and basically every serious non-mythology episode), but some of the mythology ones rank right up there with the very best.  The two-parter which ends with ""Closure"" especially is one of the high points of the series, and I actually feel that the last episode of the season was very well-done.  The two-parter which starts off the season is sort of weak, but that is largely due to the fact that the whole subplot about the craft on the beach in africa is one of the worst ideas in x-files mythology history.  Some of the humorous episodes are also extremely clever or at least amusing, such as ""The Great Mileeni"" and the one with the genie.  Overall, I'd highly recommend buying the slimpack edition of this season, as it is considerably cheaper than the original version while containing all the bonus features and having extremely superior packaging.  While it's probably the weakest season of the x-files, it's still required viewing for any fan and beats out most every other TV show out there.",1156550400,12,2373,4.775061124694377

Hungy: A boy has an unusual eating disorder that is causing him a lot of distress.

Millennium: Mulder and Scully are brought in to deal w/ the Millennium group. And the greatly anticipated first Mulder/Scully onscreen kiss also takes place in this episode.

The Goldberg Variation: A man has a very unusal streak of good luck, though his luck normally causes bad luck to the people around him.

Closure: The truth about Mulder's sister is finally reveled. This is one of the best written episodes in the series.

I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes. I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it. Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each. I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later. That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library. Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary. The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical. Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and mobid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project. Either way it's a piece of perfectly executed, mega budget, TV history and it shows in every episode.",1153440000,,1436,4.7023809523809526

1832514,4,B000089RT0,"The show can hardly be called consistent. There is great episodes but now and then there's always a clunker. Then again, season 3 which many recognize as the best did have a few fillers now and then. I mean who really liked Hell Money or the List? Well season 7, along with 5, is probably one of the weaker seasons but by no means is this an outright terrible season. It's got its moments, it just doesn't have the same level of greatness as previous seasons had.

The Sixth Extinction: A nice episode that shows Mulder's condition showing a weird side effect. 8.5/10

The Sixth Extinction II Amor Fati: A quite nice episode that delves into Mulder's life had he abandoned the X-Files and we get a great appearance by Samantha. 8.5/10

Hungry: Despite the performance by Chad E. Donnella, it's a very slow and kind of boring episode about a brain eating mutant. 6/10

Millennium: A surprisingly good crossover where Mulder and Scully team up with Frank Black(of ""Millennium"") to prevent 2000 from being apocalyptic. 8/10

Rush: A likable episode in which kids become the next Flash only not using it for the right reasons. 7.5/10

Orison: A great/creepy episode with a wonderfully-done ending which features season 2 baddie Donnie Pfaster back and he's fixated on Scully. 9/10

The Amazing Maleeni: Another likable episode dealing entirely with the magic of scheming magicians.

Signs and Wonders: A kind of poor episode where a religious man uses snakes to go after unbelievers. 5.5/10

Sein Und Zeit: Well the first half is wonderfully done about a girl who mysteriously vanishes. 9/10

Closure: Oh man. We finally get a resolution to the Samantha storyline and it falls completely on its face. Emotionally and visually it's beautiful but the explanation? Smacks of laziness. 9/10 for the episode itself, 5/10 for the story.

X-Cops: Personally I loved it. A creature is found stalking California residents and the camera crew of ""COPS"" is following them around. 8/10

First-Person Shooter: Another likable but flawed episode where Mulder and Scully take on Krista Allen and her hotness in a digital environment. 7.5/10

Theef: Another decent episode that has a guy going after a doctor using voodoo/hexcraft. 6/10

En Ami: Smoking Man writes an episode where Scully enters a reluctant partnership with him and the episode's good. 8/10

Chimera: Another decent episode that has Mulder on his own solving a case of the raven creature. 6/10

all things: don't ask about the non-capitals. But Gillian Anderson writes/directs a Scully-heavy episode concerning a former flame. It's not awesome like One Breath or Memento Mori but it's quite good. 8.5/10

Brand X: ANOTHER decent episode with oddly the best anti-smoking message you'll see. 6/10

Hollywood A.D: X-Files goes Hollywood and Mulder and Scully hate it. David Duchovny writes/directs this funny one. 8.5/10

Fight Club: One of the so bad it's good episodes where Kathy Griffin(who I can't stand) play doppelgangers who leave disaster whenever they get too close. 4.5/10

Je Souhaite: Another funny episode involving a jinnyah(female genie) who grants wishes that don't bode well for the wisher. 8/10

Requiem: Mulder and Scully return to Oregon to revisit the people from the Pilot and 2 surprising twists for the lead. It's a fitting finale that thankfully wasn't the series finale. 9/10

The biggie episode of course is Closure, which finally answers the question after 7 years of what happened to Samantha Mulder. While it's certainly a great looking episode and emotionally its topnotch, the way that the resolution is told to me screams laziness and writing themselves into a corner. Also in a weird way, they didn't have the original actress, Vanessa Morley, to play her. While it's not that big of a thing, it would've ended things on a nice way.

The real problem with this season is that there's too many decent episodes. It seemed almost easier to pick the great ones because there wasn't as much to remember. It is a season of ambitiousness since we get X-COPS, First-Person Shooter, all things and Hollywood A.D(in a way) and the season premiere.

It's a season that's still worth watching(even 8 and 9 have its moments now and then) but the consistency of great/good episodes on here is quite off.",1152230400,7,4268,4.97887323943662
1832515,4,B000089RT0,"I was a big fan of the earlier seasons of the X Files but had not seen anything beyond Season 5.  I have now finished Season 7, and while I would say it is the weakest season so far, it's still worth watching for the episodes that do work and are good.  The duds are there, a few of the worst episodes I've seen, but overall this season was better than I thought it would be based on what I've heard from others.",1151280000,3,412,3.9518072289156625
1832516,5,B000089RT0,"The new slimpack releases of Seasons 7 through 9-which are essentially the original sets with the extras disc removed as well as many other special features-will complete the entire rerelease of all the X-FILES in affordable editions.  I've been disappointed to find many of the special features missing in the first six volumes, but given that I couldn't afford the original editions, I'm all in all delighted to finally own my own copies, instead of relying on video stores and Netflix.

Season Seven is, on the one hand, unquestionably the weakest of the first seven that featured David Duchovny fulltime, and perhaps even weaker than Season Eight when Duchovny was only a part time member of the cast. On the other hand, the series still had more outstanding episodes than the vast majority of shows in TV history. So, my five-star rating reflects the show compared with other series, not with other seasons in its own run. In my opinion, the only season weaker than this one is the unfortunate Season Nine, with the near complete loss of David Duchovny and the weak overall story line.

Why did Season Seven fail to measure up to other X-Files seasons? First, there was the loss of the overall alien colonization story line. The season starts with a carry over of the final episode of Season Six, that seems to be reasserting an alien arc, but in fact this is a false promise, and the story told in that brief arc more or less disappears from the show. The problem, in fact, the show had in its final three seasons was the lack of a consistent and compelling story arc. There are efforts at story arcs, but the ""super soldiers"" arc that becomes full blown in Season Nine was riffled with inconsistencies, and was definitely not compelling. Still, the loss of Mulder in Season Eight provided a focus for that Season, while Season Nine at least had the opportunity of exploring the new partnership of Doggett and Reyes. Season Seven essentially had memories of the six seasons that preceded it.

Nonetheless, Season Seven still contained many absolutely outstanding individual episodes. From beginning to end of the series, the writers never lost the ability to concoct a killer tale to be told in 43 minutes. ""X-Cops"" is a classic among the Mulder-Scully parody episodes, with the real-life production crew of the show COPS capturing the duo on videotape as an X-File collides with a police investigation supposedly being covered for the show. Typically, Scully spends most of the episode glaring disdainfully at the cameramen, while Mulder delightfully welcomes their presence. The dramatic highlight might be the heart-rending two-parter of ""Sein und Zeit"" (with apologies to Martin Heidegger) and ""Closure,"" which features one of the best single-episode guest appearances ever by Anthony Heald (a role so outstanding that a reprisal of the role would have seem necessary, but which sadly never occurred) as a man who claims he has visions of departed children. Images from those episodes are among some of the most haunting in the series of the show. ""Millennium"" features what is technically Mulder and Scully's first kiss (with Mulder commenting afterwards, technically commenting on the Y2K predictions of disaster, ""See, the world didn't end""). The intensely romantic non-romance between Mulder and Scully becomes such a joke that in ""Fight Club"" Mulder mentions a doppelganger pair of agents who had, believe it or not, been together for seven years but had not had a romantic relationship. ""En Ami"" is a marvelous swan song for the Cigarette Smoking Man, as he persuades Scully to help him in a caper (he would reappear later in the season to die, but would thereafter tragically be missing from the show, another problem the show had in its final two seasons). ""all things"" (lower cap) is my personal favorite of the season, an absolutely astonishing tour de force by Gillian Anderson that reveals depths of talent in a host of directions that no one could have anticipated. She wrote, directed, and acted in the episode (with Mulder largely absent) as Scully unexpectedly reencounters a former professor/mentor, a man who was married at the time she and he had what was evidently a torrid love affair, revealing more about Scully's past than we had ever learned before. The show is outstanding on multiple levels, including visually and narratively (as well as musically, helped not merely by Mark Snow's usually brilliant score but by contributions by Moby). It also features the best teaser in the history of the show, with Scully at the beginning dressing in what turns out to be Mulder's bathroom, and leaving the apartment with a naked Mulder in his bed. The episode is so outstanding the viewer is only left to wonder why Gillian Anderson wrote and directed only this one. Probably my favorite Scully episode since the one where she learned that she had, inexplicably, a genetic daughter.

There were also some disappointing moments. ""Hollywood A.D."" simultaneously was one of the funniest and worse episodes, a weak X-file with a funny backstory of a Hollywood producer (a friend of Skinner) following Mulder and Scully in order to gather background for a Hollywood film. Though much in the episode is wooden, there are some precious moments, such as the producer talking in the phone to studio execs: ""No, its an optical illusion. She is actually quite tall"" (obviously referring to Scully--I have always been extremely sceptical about the 5'3 or 5'2 that is often given as Gillian Anderson's height). Also wonderful is the exquisite pairing the wildly improbable Gary Shandling as Fox Mulder with Tea Leoni (in real life Mrs. David Duchovny) as Scully. Anyone who saw Gary Shandling's THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW knows that David Duchovny was one of ""Larry Sanders's"" more frequent guests, with many jokes about Duchovny having a cursh on Sanders, so that Shandling's playing Mulder is a fairly complex in-joke. Another perfect moment in the episode is Leoni asking Scully to show her how she is able to run in heels. We then see while Shandling and Mulder talk in the foreground, Scully in the distant background sprinting from one side of the stage to the other while Leoni looks on.

But for me the biggest disappointment is the final episode, ""Requiem,"" which is more or less Mulder's exit from the show. Although he would reappear in a few episodes in the final two seasons, this episode ends the seven-season partnership between Mulder and Scully. The episode, despite some fine moments, just didn't seem to have the ""gravitas"" that such a key episode would seem to require. It did nicely take place in the same town in Oregon that saw Mulder and Scully have their first adventure together in Season One, but all in all it was not one of the more remarkable episodes.

In the end, the ending of the greatest partnership in TV history is what creates an indescribable sadness at the end of the season. There would be two final seasons, with many great new episodes, but if you had to point to the single thing that made THE X-FILES such an amazing phenomena, it was--along with the great writing--the exquisite pairing of Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny as Mulder and Scully.  Many of us remain hopeful that there will be a future movie.  We know that the key figures have discussed it and have all expressed a willingness.  But so far we have had no definite indications that Mulder and Scully will get together again.  Hopefully the truth is out there.",1143417600,124,7482,4.9113924050632916
1832517,4,B000089RT0,"The 7th season of ""The X-Files"" found the stand alone episodes as the stand out episodes as well. The best episodes did what the series always did best. ""Hungry"" told the story of a creature that sucks out brains to live and regrets every minute of it. It's a compelling episode because for the first time we see the point of view of the monster.  ""The Goldberg Variation"" about a guy with all the luck in the world and disaster for anyone who messes with him. ""X-Cops"" plays as a witty parody of the Fox TV show ""Cops"". Shot in the same style as ""Cops"" it perfectly captures both the absurdity and sense of danger in that show. Although ""Hollywood AD"" written and directed by David Duchovny has its moments it just doesn't gel for me personally but does have fine performances. Garry Shandling and Mrs. Duchovny Tea Leoni are cast as Mulder and Scully in a movie version of one of their cases. It's a clever parody of why so many Hollywood projects that look so promising go bad.

""The Sixth Extinction"" and ""Amor Fati"" have a compelling stories at their core but are overcome by some hamfisted writing by Chris Carter. Still, the show is visually impressive and features some strong performances. In this particular episode Scully goes to an excavation site along the African coast to uncover the meaning of strange markings on an alien spaceshift buried under the beach in order to save Mulder. He has been infected by an alien virus triggered by the rubbings from the craft's exterior that is burning out his brain by increasing synaptic activity at breathtaking speed.

""Sein Und Zeit"" and ""Closure"" are more successful episodes. The first episode deals with the disappearence of a girl with an odd note left behind apparently by her own mother. In ""Closure"" Mulder discovers what truly happened to his sister after all his years of searching. The latter episode is moving particularly if you've followed the series from the first episode. In ""En Ami"" the Cigarette Smoking Man returns seeking Scully's help; he claims to be dying and he also claims that he and Scully can save the lives of others that, like Scully, have been abducted and returned. To this he needs her help and she must trust him. Actress Gillian Anderson writes and directs the marvelous ""All Things"". The season closes the way the show began with a follow up to an episode from the first season involving abducted teenagers. The aftermath of these events set up another story arc involving another nasty alien plot.

This set comes with commentary tracks on ""First Person Shooter by Chris Carter, Gillian Anderson on ""All Things"" and writer Vince Gilligan on ""Je Sohaite"". A couple of episodes have deleted scenes that you can integrate into the episode by going to the menu and activating it. There are also a number of international language clips as well but the last disc that featured the special effects featurettes and documentary are NOT included here as part of this set. Image and sound qualtiy are extremely good as they feature the original transfers done for the previous set.",1141948800,26,3065,4.766478342749529

However, this is the season when the X-Files began down the slippery slope that lead to the shows' demise.  Season seven had some of the last of the truely great episodes (6th Extinction, Amor Fati, Orison, First Person Shooter, etc.), but also had at least one stinker (X-Cops).  The stories ran from the main arch of aliens, to the occult and religion.  Overall the stories were very good, classic X-Files, but showed some of the faults that started to bring the series down (trying to be gimmicky, as in X-Cops and [one of my favorites] First Person Shooter).  Requiem, the final episode of season seven is where Mulder is abducted by aliens.  This allows the rift between Duchovny and Chris Carter to widen during the hiatus, and, eventually the end of the series.

1832522,5,B000089RT0,"Nominated for 12 Golden Globes and 61 Emmys, including 4 for Outstanding Drama Series, The X-Files is one of the world's most popular science-fiction drama shows. Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...

The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...

The X-Files (Season 7) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""The Sixth Extinction"" in which Scully travels to Africa in an attempt to unravel the meaning of a series of hieroglyphics inscribed on an alien spacecraft discovered just off Ivory Coast. Meanwhile, Mulder seems to be going insane, and he enlists the help of others to find out what's wrong with him... Other notable episodes from Season 7 include ""Orison"" in which a reverend who's befriended an inmate helps the man escape from prison, but instead of turning to God, the convict sets his sights on revenge against Scully...

1832523,3,B000089RT0,"Season 7 is probably one of the weakest seasons of the X-Files. But it remains X-Files at its worst is better than most tv out there today. Season 7 suffered mainly because it was Duchovny's last season, and at several points you can tell he wants to be anywhere but on the set. Also, since the colonization plot line was resolved in season 6 the mythology suffered. Alot of the episodes have bad storylines, such as Rush, an episode dealing with a couple of teens who can move super fast. First Person Shooter is a stupid premise to begin with [the Lone Gunmen are stuck in a virtual reality game and Mulder has to save them] and features Duchovny drudging through a script that isn't giving him much to want to work for. And that leads me to the next problem. The scripts were painfully bad at times, and it shows that the actors, although wanting to try and make a bad script good, it just isn't possible with some of the scripts. And to make matters worse, even the mythology episodes weren't very exciting. Sixth Extinctio 1 and 2 are for the most part boring, and the revelation in part 2 is anti climactic. Other times, ideas done in past episodes were redone, such as Signs and Wonders. However, when season 7 had a good script and a good, original idea the episode turned out great. Hungry is told from the perspective of a brain eating monster who wants to kick the habit. The Amazing Maleeni is about two fueding magicians, whose fighting is actually a cover for a heist. all things, written and directed by Gillian Anderson is a powerful episode, that gives us some more insight into Scully, and why she gave up a  career in medicine to be and agent. Duchovny's Hollywood A.D. has the X-Files being made into a movie, some hilarious scenes in that one. The season finale Requiem is a tour de force with Mulder and Scully going back to where there first case took place to investigate a downed UFO. One of the best X-Files ending in the history of the show. I am glad though that they season went out on a high note, and although it had it's missteps was still alright. Luckily, the show would recover from the missteps of season 7 with the great season 8.",1120521600,,2167,4.444723618090452
1832524,4,B000089RT0,"It was early in Season 7 that I stopped watching ""The X-Files"" regularly. Maybe, after the pretensions and anticlimax of ""The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati,"" I had lost enough interest in the mythology to abandon the show (until the series finale). Whatever reason it was, it was only via syndicated reruns and this DVD set that I was finally able to catch all of the episodes from Season 7, which, in many ways, continued where Season 6---one of the most creative and inventive seasons of the show, I think---left off.

Mythology-wise, Season 7 was basically about tying up loose ends. The opening two-parter ""The Sixth Extinction"" and the aforementioned ""Amor Fati"" picked up from the Season 6 finale ""Biogenesis,"" which found Scully pondering the origin of man while Mulder was suffering from an unknown mental condition. Of course, everything turns out all right in the end, but not after Mulder has undergone a LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST-type evaluation of the choices he made in his life in ""Amor Fati""---an interesting idea that is done in by drearily ponderous, rather pretentious treatment. And then there is ""Sein und Zeit""/""Closure,"" which supposedly resolves the mystery surrounding Mulder's sister Samantha's disappearance, but which left a lot of fans feeling disappointed, even angered. I dunno...I thought the resolution worked well as a spiritual release. While ""Closure"" did not end the way many fans preferred, I thought it was a creative way of allowing Mulder to let go of that pain he's been carrying for so long---even if, at this point, most fans had understandably lost faith in Chris Carter's concluding everything neatly.

The mythology, though, is, I suppose, not necessarily the focus of Season 7. The standalones, to me, are really the thing here, and it's a truly varied lot. While there are inevitably some mediocrities (""Millennium,"" ""First Person Shooter,"" ""Fight Club"") to be found, it's still rather amazing how many good things there are to be found in this late season. Season 7 episodes like ""The Goldberg Variation"" and ""The Amazing Maleeni"" continue Season 6's penchant for clever, almost wacky plots; on the other hand, there are some interesting explorations of the Cigarette Smoking Man and Scully in, respectively, ""En Ami"" (written by William B. Davis himself) and the very uneven but generally effective ""all things"" (written and directed by Gillian Anderson). In the mix, there are some creepy returns to the old pre-L.A. ""X-Files"" form in episodes like ""Signs and Wonders"" and Theef"" (which is possibly a better voodoo story than Season 2's muddled ""Fresh Bones""). Meanwhile, David Duchovny returned to writing and directing with ""Hollywood A.D."", a farfetched religious mystery that turns into a funny (if perhaps a bit too facile) satire of Hollywood. And writer Vince Gilligan---creator of previous classics like Season 4's ""Small Potatoes"" and Season 5's ""Bad Blood""---returned with more delightful episodes, including ""Hungry,"" ""X-Cops"" (a ""X-Files"" episode in ""Cops"" garb), and the lightly cynical ""Je Souhaite."" All in all, there are still quite a few flashes of brilliance to be found in Season 7, even if the strain in creativity may have been starting to show in some of the episodes (certainly more so than in Season 6).

Finally, there is ""Requiem,"" a season finale that arguably serves both as a bookend to the first seven years and a look forward into the future. The episode was intended as a possible series finale until a last-minute decision extended the show for at least another year. Whether that decision was a good one in light of the subsequent, controversial final two seasons is open to debate; but ""Requiem"" at least managed to create a compelling-enough cliffhanger for Season 8 while closing out the so-called ""Duchovny era"" (this was to be Duchovny's last full season on the show).

The seventh season of ""The X-Files,"" continuing where the equally divisive Season 6 left off, will probably never be as much of a consensus fan favorite as, say, Seasons 2 or 3. Those who believe the show began to decline in Season 6---when the crew moved to L.A. from its original Vancouver location---will only see more signs of it in Season 7. (Naysayers may also have ammunition regarding stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, both of whom occasionally look rather bored onscreen.) Despite its pits, though, I think there are enough fine episodes and good moments in this season to warrant a look. It may not be among the top ""X-Files"" seasons---Season 3 is still probably the best of the 9---but Season 7 is still worth seeing. Recommended.",1119830400,2,4612,5.080474934036939

1832527,5,B000089RT0,"Up until a few months ago, I never watched a single episode of the X-Files. However, now that the DVD sets have been reduced in price, I had the opportunity to start watching the show. Right off the bat, I was hooked immediately and with each passing season the show became established in my eyes as one of the best and most addictive sci-fi shows ever created. The overall opinion of most of the fans is that the first six seasons of the show are the best, and that seasons seven through nine are mainly average. Another complaint from the fans is that since season seven is Duchovny's last full season with the show, that he did not put as much energy into the character Fox Mulder as he did in the past. Well I am here to tell you that not only is Duchovny still at the top of his game, but season seven is a great season overall and extremely underrated.

  My expectations for the seventh season going in were extremely low, and after I finished, I was literally in shock at how good the season turned out to be. While season six still remains the best season of the show, the seventh season is definately one of the most enjoyable seasons of the entire show in my opinion. There a few episodes from season seven that are up for being part of my top ten list such as X-Cops in which Mulder and Scully are put into an actual episode of the show COPS while in search of a monster, The Amazing Meelini in which Mulder and Scully investigate the death of a magician, The Goldberg Variation in which Mulder and Scully meet the luckiest man on earth that manages to pass bad luck onto everyone around him, Je Souhaite in which Mulder discovers a 500 year old genie, and the amazing season finale Requiem. Other episodes worth mentioning are Millenium in which the character Frank Black from the show Millenium makes an appearance, Hungry, Rush, Signs and Wonders, and Orison in which the serial killer Donnie Faster who abducted Scully in season two makes a return.

  Overall, the seventh season is one of the best of the entire show based on what I have seen so far. I have yet to see the eigth and ninth seasons, but with seasons five and six being as good as they were, and season seven being Duchovny's last full one, I doubt the show gets any better than the first seven seasons. The DVD set manages to be great once again. There is an extensive documentary on season seven as a whole, as well as 10 deleted scenes, commentary on three different episodes, and more.

  A solid 5 stars...",1091145600,6,2492,4.4
1832528,4,B000089RT0,"If season 6 was the high point for ""The X-Files"" (and many fans feel it is), than season 7 catches the series at the top of the other side. While some of the episodes play a bit flat, the bulk of season 7 is, contrary to other reviews, worthwhile picking up on DVD. The first two episodes of season 7 ""The Sixth Extinction"" immediately grabs your attention with a strong two parter that relates directly to the mythology episodes of previous seasons. We also have a conclusion, of sorts, to the running narrative about Mulder's search for his sister. The mythology episodes really isn't what the seventh season is about; it's the experimentation. Season 7 featured the most experimental, on the edge and downright strange episodes of the entire run. Running the gaumont from satire (""Hollywood A.D."") to melodrama with spiritual overtones (""all things"")to traditional X-Files horror and a sympathetic look at a ""monster"" (""Hungry""), the series continued to push the envelope as to what was acceptable for the show.
Sure, there were some missteps. The ""Millenium"" episode where the two television series meet to resolve the cancelled series featuring Lance Henrinksen seems a bit out of place here. It's not a bad episode, it just doesn't really fit the series. Then again, it's part of the ""risk"" factor that happened during season 7. The comedic ""The Goldberg Variations"" where a man literally has great luck that leads to very, very bad luck also works quite well. Likewise, ""X-Cops"" with its satire on faux reality shows pushes the envelope of the series as well ditching the traditional filmic quality of the series in favor of the look of the show it satirizes--""Cops"".
It's clear from the season ending cliff hanger and much of the latter part of the season that Carter, Spotnitz, Gilligan and the other main writers weren't quite sure if season 7 was the end. They set up a story that could have been resolved in a couple of two hour movies. The thing to keep in mind about season 7 is many of the episodes that are comdemmed as subpar actually are edgy, risk taking fare that doesn't fit into the more ""traditional"" types of stories that ""The X-Files"" told.
The extras are pretty good here. We get audio commentary including one from Gillian Anderson about the episode she wrote and directed (""all things"") although Duchovny is curiously absent from the ones he wrote, co-wrote and/or directed as far as commentary tracks. There's also a fine featurette that discusses the direction of the series and the difficulties Carter and crew faced with Duchovny leaving.
Picture and sound quality are top-notch although I have noticed a lot of these boxed sets with episodes that are flawed with sound problems. The drop in the price of the sets are a welcome sight for fans who hadn't purchased the series on DVD (I was still watching my VHS and homemade DVD's before the price break). Frankly, I wish that Paramount and other studios would follow suit for these expensive boxed sets. The extras are nice but, really, you could record the stuff off TV so the price break is welcome.
In reality, with season 8 the series began anew with new characters and new story arcs. While the series had already peaked, it still had a very strong solid season or two of life left in it.",1088208000,5,3275,4.777777777777778
1832529,3,B000089RT0,"I just couldn't get into Season 7 of The X-Files.
It's not from lack of trying, though. My wife and I watched each episode faithfully every night (sometimes two episodes per night) until they were all gone
Yet, despite the fact that we're huge X-Files fans, our conclusion is that Episode 7 is lackluster at best. The stories were one-offs (and weak ones at that), the monsters were ho-hum, the action wasn't gripping, and it seemed as if everyone was just walking through his/her part. Sleep walking, that is.
I think the lack of aliens and conspiracy villians really took a toll on The X-Files. Without the overarching threat of either alien invasion or government cover-ups, nothing much really goes on in the lives of Mulder and Scully.
The only hint that something cool *could* happen is when Mulder and Scully got closer emotionally and physically. Their relationship is a truly great one already (one of the best on television), but we wanted to see it taken to the next level. Alas, that was not to be.
We've watched Seasons 1-8 so far and I have to say Season 7 is the weakest of the bunch. Season 8 (see my other review), which receives a lot of grief because of Mulder's absence and Scully's emotionalism (hey, she's pregnant; give her a break!), is far superior to Season 7.
You can read other reviews to get a play-by-play of each episode in Season 7. All I want to do in this review is provide my two cents worth.
My advice: Unless you're a completist who needs to have every season, I'd skip Season 7 and go right into Season 8. You won't miss anything -- except for a lot of uneventful episodes.",1085356800,4,1611,4.5395189003436425
1832530,5,B000089RT0,"...P>Mulder and Scully were still together for this, their last season as the two leading characters of one of the best dramatic series in television history.
After the movie, the move to L.A. and the predominance of humorous episodes throughout the Sixth Season and the incredible resolution of the original mythology, the seventh season started with a bang but not with a little anxiety on the fans' side because this was the much rumored final season. ...
Myth Episodes:
The Seventh Season starts with the two parts of a new mythology that started with the last episode of Season Six called Biogenesis.
The Sixth Extinction and The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati (Wich translated means ""Love Of Fate"")carry on with the theory that Mulder might be a succesful Human - Alien Hybrid!!!
It's extremely important that you don't miss the Two Parter:
Sein Und Zeit (Wich means ""Being and Time"") and Closure wich puts to rest, in an extremely precious form, the Samantha Mulder mistery giving the Fox Character one of his few moments of rest throughout the whole series.
And Requiem... The best of the best in Season Finale's. Although it would ultimately lead the series into only God knows what.
Stand Alone Episodes (Or Monster of the Week):
Orison:
Witnesses the return of a villain that appeared before in earlier seasons. Great script by Chip Johanessen (Former collaborator of Beverly Hills 90210 and Millenium).
The Amazing Maleeni:
Actually not an X File, but an excellent proof that the series still had a lot of fuel. Excellent Turn of Screw at the end!!!
X Cops:
Cops, The X Files and Vince Gilligan... What's not to like?
Theef:
Voodoo. Nuff Said!!!
Chimera:
David Amann at his best!!!
En Ami (Wich means ""One Friend"", although its a play on words wich in english can be understood as ""enemy""):
Written by the CSM himself (William B. Davis)!!!
All Things:
Written and Directed by Gillian Anderson. Not the best, but the teaser (considered one of the most controversials in the whole series' existence) is worth the whole package.
Je Souhaite (I Wish):
Written and directed by Vince Gilligan.
After this, the series was transformed into a mix up that even Chris Carter didn't understand at all. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate Robert Patrick's character or even Annabeth Gish's but John Dogget and Monica Reyes didn't achieve to give the series that feeling we all know very well. That X FILES feeling.
I'm so sorry that David Duchovny got transformed into such an egotistical person. The series would have been succesful with him in it. You can see him act like a Zombie (Check out Chimera)and he already looks tired. Maybe the series would've finished here and continue in a new movie. Heck! The series could've even ended with Season Eight, but no! Fox had to continue exploiting fans. And we gladly let them... But not for long.
Hope you enjoy having the only and real seven seasons of what can be called the television phenomenon of the last century.
I WILL buy the las two seasons, only to feed my collectionist's hunger, and because the movie will start where the last episode of the Ninth (and worst season) left off.
Long Live the X Files!!!
Long Live the X Philes!!!

1832531,4,B000089RT0,"IMHO, this is the weakest season of The X-Files. The alien conspiracy we were following for six years ended in the middle of season 6, and was taken to a different direction by the end. So season 7 started dealing with the plot of aliens creating human beings, and then ""resolved"" the plot of Mulder's sister's abduction, and ended with a pretty good cliffhanger that took the show in an even more different direction in the next season.
[Spoilers]
The resolution to the plot of Mulder's sister wasn't satisfying to me. I think I speak for most X-Fans when I say that we wanted Mulder to find his sister alive, and have her be a part of his life again. Instead, we find out she's been dead since 1987! So this whole time Mulder's looking for her ends up just being a waste. All those years of us following this story ends up not really being worth following. Ok, so Mulder can end his quest. He's free. Fine. But couldn't that happen with his sister actually being alive?!
[End Spoilers]
Other weak points in the series were a couple of stand-alone episodes that were just rancid in my opinion. ""Hollywood A.D."" and ""Fight Club."" What the heck were they thinking when they wrote these episodes?! I have to admit though, the reference to Plan 9 From Outerspace in ""Hollywood A.D."" was cool though. But both of these episodes were just too absurd for what The X-Files was known for. This show always had humorous happenings throughout its run, but these two episodes were just too over the top.
But aside from the plot of Mulder's sister, and the two not-so-good stand-alone episodes mentioned above, I found this season to be pretty good. But I also thought since this was David Duchovny's last full season, that they kind of wasted his character. But the show ended with a band, which lead it into an interesting new direction for the show's next season.
Good season, great DVD.",1080777600,5,1878,4.608955223880597
1832532,4,B000089RT0,"Granted, every previous season is probably better than season 7 (I rank them in this order: 3, 5, 6, 1, 2, 4, then 7.) That being said, this season is very worthwhile to own on DVD for several amazing, ground breaking episodes.
First of all, I love the Sixth Extinction trilogy that began with Biogenesis at the end of season 6. Mulder's alternate reality, in which he has children with Diana Fowley, grows old and watches everyone he loves grow old and die (except the Cigarette Smoking Man) then witnesses the alien Armegeddon, is absolutely brilliant. Scully is his touch stone that gets him through the ordeal, and he tells her so after he awakens.
The other two-part episode (Sein Und Zeit and the Closure) allows Mulder to find closure with regard to Samantha. I did not like this episode at first, but upon further consideration I feel satisfied that it was a nice way to resolve Samantha's abduction. (Probably not many people remember that the idea of ""walk-ins"" was introduced back in season 2's Red Museum episode.) Seeing Samantha as a beautiful young lady of 14 was very touching to me.
Some of my all-time favorite stand alone episodes are in season 7, including the Rush, the Goldberg Variation, the Amazing Maleeni, the Signs and Wonders, Chimera and Je Souhaite, all of which are extremely clever and intriguing.
But mostly I want to comment on All Things, the episode written and directed by Gillian Anderson that I somehow had never seen until very recently. Scully discovers the power of the Present Moment as she follows her spiritual guidance (in the form of synchronistic events, and the appearance of a woman that may be interpreted as an angel) to clear up an unresolved situation from her past. Most people do not seem to understand or appreciate this episode (the general concensus is that Scully is very much out of character...) but I thought it was simply brilliant.
It makes perfect sense to me that Scully would finally, after almost seven years on the X Files, begin to realize that not everything can be adequately explained by science. It also makes sense from the standpoint that Scully is now 35, a time in life when many people start to become spiritual. This is consistent with previous episodes (season 1 Beyond the Sea, season 3 Revelations, season 5 All Souls, etc. - whenever the X File was mystical in nature) when Mulder was the skeptic and Scully the one who ""saw the signs."" It also set the stage for Season 8, when Doggett joined the show and Scully became the believer.
The only thing preventing a 5 star review is the presence of some really bad episodes (Millenium, First Person Shooter, Fight Club, and Hollywood AD) but hey - 18 good ones out of 22 ain't bad !",1078272000,5,2713,4.701680672268908
1832533,5,B000089RT0,"With the phenomenal success of Season Six of The X-Files, the new fans who were with the show since viewing the theatrical release of the movie in the summer of 1998 and old fans alike awaited the Seventh Season with bated breath. The Seventh Season was a time of re-invention for The X-Files. Many long-running story arcs and well-known characters made an exit, and new themes were explored. Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny also wrote and directed episodes which uncovered more of Scully and Mulder's past histories and, in the process, revealed new depths of characterization.
However, the biggest question concerning closure was whether the show's Seventh Season would be its last. With inflating egos and movie roles flooding in, many of the show's cast (inparticular David Duchovny) became increasingly dissatisfied with their roles in the sci-fi phenomenon. This could be disguised early on through moody character personalities, but towards the end it was inevitable that the show was running out of steam.
At the end of the Sixth Season, Mulder lay in a neurological unit after his brain was infected by powerful rubbings from the shell of a space craft that had emerged from the sea of Africa's Ivory Coast in the gripping finale ""Biogenesis."" The Seventh Season opened with the two-parter ""The Sixth Extinction"" and ""The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati"" in which this plot line was put to rest after the subject proved too powerful for even Scully to decipher. These are the first two mythology episodes of the season, which are followed by the superb ""Sein Und Seit."" A little girl goes missing in this episode which leads Mulder and Scully on a case to find her that relates back to Samantha, Mulder's missing sister. The proceeding episode ""Closure"" is more of a mythology episode where Mulder finally meets his sister. The crew knew Duchovny was leaving at the end of the season, so they decided to wrap it all up in a moment that fans had been waiting seven years for.
""En Ami"" is a mythology episode totally written and directed by William B. David, the Cigarette Smoking Man himself! In this episode he offers Scully a cure for cancer, but is it all a con? ""All Things"" was the first episode that Gillian Anderson wrote and directed herself. It's a slow-moving episode and very powerful in that it reveals a lot about Scully's past, and the idea that she might have an affair with a married man who is now sick in hospital. Her search for the truth is incredibly spiritual. The final episode of the season ""Requiem"" is one of the greatest episodes of the show's entire run. This proves that the truth really is out there as Mulder is abducted and Scully reveals her pregnancy in one of the most gripping episodes in all television history. This was the episode that made the show legendary in my opinion. Absolutely superb.
The stand-alone episode of Season Seven aren't as good as previous seasons with some tankers like ""Signs & Wonders"" and ""First Person Shooter,"" but there are still some superb highlights. ""Rush,"" ""The Goldberg Variation,"" ""The Amazing Maleeni,"" ""Theef,"" ""Chimera,"" ""Fight Club"" and ""Je Souhaite"" are all brilliant but the true highlights come with episode such as ""Hungry."" In this superb episode we meet a young and seemingly harmless boy, who isn't quite all he seems. To cure his hunger cravings he turns into an alien type hybrid, yet you can't help but feel sympathy for him as the episode is written from his perspective. ""Millennium"" features Mulder and Scully's first proper on-screen kiss as 1999 draws to a close. This is worth the price of the season alone and the superb zombie-style episode adds to this. ""Orison"" is just superb classic X-Files in which Donnie Pfaster escapes from jail after his five-year lock in. The hair/fingernails/death fetishist first appeared in Season 2's ""Irresistible"" and took Scully hostage in one of the most horrifying episodes of the show, and in this episode he's back to exact his revenge. Superb action and acting from Gillian Anderson inparticular.
""X-Cops"" is one of the boldest episodes of the show ever. Obviously influenced by The Blair Witch Project, the episode is filmed documentary style in the night as the agents try to uncover clues about what is attacking a rough neighborhood. ""Brand X"" is a superb episode with an original plotline about cigarettes and the effects it has on people, while ""Hollywood A.D."" is definitely a season highlight. Written and directed by David Duchovny, it sees a man trying to make Mulder and Scully's exploits into an on-screen blockbuster of comedy, romance and action. Tea Leoni (Duchovny's wife) is the woman playing Scully, and the scene where Scully's teaching her how to run in her shoes is one of the most hilarious moments of the entire show!
OVERALL GRADE: 10/10
The Special Features of this Seventh Season are equally brilliant as those on offer with the Sixth Season. We get an all new documentary, ""The Truth About Season Seven,"" deleted scenes from no less than seven of the best episodes, special effect sequences from ten episodes, character profiles on A.D. Skinner and Samantha Mulder and a mammoth 43 promotional television spots. All in all, Season Seven was a superb season of The X-Files in my opinion. Not many people like it because it's different, but hey, different is good. I wouldn't say it was the show's best season - far from it, but it's still great television viewing.

1832536,3,B000089RT0,"This is by far, the worst season of all the series. It starts with a great double episode ""The sixth extinction"" which is the best triple myth-arc episode ever released. Connected to the season 6 Finale:""Biogenesis"" it introducesanew concept on man's evolutionary process. Mulder is locked up in a hospital experiencing an immense abnormal brain activity caused by exposure to an artifact that a african university professor finds in the coasts of the african continent. Scully goes there to investigate another piece of artifact only to discover a spaceship halfsurfaced on the sea shore that is covered by symbols that seem to belong to a Navajo alphabet. while scully works hard on deciphering the meaning of the message on the ship, Mulder(who beleives that the message come from aliens-and that human kind was born elsewhere in the universe, but put on earth by the same aliens) tries to fight his ailment. A lot of shocking discoveries are revealed in the beginning of this season. But Chris Carter decided to discontinue this part of the Mythology and carry on with some episodes that destroyed the whole cycle. David Duchovny seems totally bored in this season and it looks like he was really trying to get out of the x-files. Gillian on the other hand acts very well, and with great passion. Some of my favorite episodes, except the one analyzed above were:
""Rush""-Typical teenage scary movie type of storyline.
""Orizon""-The psychotic fetiscist from season 2 returns again for Scully.
""First person shooter""-Great episode with guest star:Super beautiful, sexy,magnificent:KRISTA ALLEN.
""Hollywood ID""-One of the funniest episodes of the season(hollywwod producer makes a movie about mulder and scully) and last but not least--Requiem: Mulder is abducted by aliens(this is where he leaves the show),while investigating the abduction of the same kids from Oregon, he and agent scully investigated in the 1st episode of the show. This is one fascinating episode. ""Closure""-The solution of Samantha's case is a big disappointment which ruins the whole season. After all these years of looking for his sister, mulder finds out that good spirit transformed her body into pure essence:starlight to protect her from further alien experiments. Romantic and touching at some parts, but very disappointing. Millennium was a very bad episode. Chris carter could have come up with a better storyline than just the 4 horsemen of the apokalypse. The only highlight is Mulder kissing Scully in the mouth at the end of the episode. The rest of the standalone ones are junk. Anyway, if you have the other dvds, buy this 1 too.

I mean, how many times now has Scully or Mulder died or almost died? In first episode he is mad as a hatter and by the second he's ""all well"" again.

1832538,3,B000089RT0,"I gave this set a rating of 3 out of 5 because even at its worst, The X-Files was a pretty good show.  Compared to the other seasons, however, it's by far the worst, for several reasons.
The first is the sorry state into which the mythology fell.  The alien colonization story was basically resolved in Season 6, with the ""Two Fathers""/""One Son"" two-parter, so a new mythology was started with the Season 6 finale ""Biogenesis.""  This carried over into the opening two episodes of Season 7, and its basic premise is this: An alien spacecraft is found on the coast of West Africa, and on its surface is engraved text in Navajo, including the entire human genome and sections from the Bible and Qu'ran.  Radiation from rubbings of the ship - not the actual ship, mind you - trigger in Mulder alien DNA present as a result of the black oil he was exposed to in the Season 4 episode ""Tunguska.""  This causes Mulder to develop psychic powers that he can't control and are driving him insane.  He is cured by the Cigarette-Smoking Man performing a ""genetic transplant"" (whatever that is) in order to gain Mulder's powers himself.  Oh, and Mulder undergoes this transplant while in a highly pretentious and ""philosophical"" dream sequence.  Sound bad?  It is.  This is followed by a two-parter which finally reveals the fate of Mulder's sister, namely that she was rescued from sinister experimentation by benevolent spirits that transformed her soul into starlight... or something.  Fortunately, the season finale ""Requiem"" delves back into familiar elements of the mythology, and paves the way for the almost uniformly excellent Season 8.
""Humorous"" episodes were another problem.  Like Season 6, Season 7 featured several ""funny"" episodes that were silly and zany but not actually very amusing, unlike the excellent spoofs in the early seasons.  ""Hollywood A.D.,"" whose plot involves a film adaptation of one of Mulder and Scully's cases, is a prime example of this.
The worst offender, however, was not a mythology or humor episode, but rather ""all things,"" a soap opera-like episode that's just barely an X-File.  In it, a prestigious doctor who Scully had had an affair with is suffering from a serious heart condition, and Scully, skeptical Scully, resorts to New Age-y crystal magicks to cure him.  This episode was written by actress Gillian Anderson, who is apparently a big devotee of New Age philosophy.  That's fine, but this episode is horribly out of character for Scully.  It is, in my opinion, the X-Files' worst episode.
Every cloud has a silver lining, and there were some episodes in Season 7 of the quality of the pre-movie seasons.  Standouts include ""Theef,"" involving an affluent surgeon being stalked by a vengeful warlock, and ""Brand X,"" about myserious deaths related to genetically engineered tobacco.
Is Season 7 worth buying?  For hardcore X-Philes, sure, since there are some truly excellent episodes among the bad ones.  If you're only a casual fan, though, I'd recommend skipping this one - but make sure to read an online synopsis of ""Requiem,"" in preparation for the superb Season 8.",1069372800,7,3109,4.9652509652509655

1832541,3,B000089RT0,"Season 7 was the beginning of a transitional period for The X-Files; the lead stars (especially David Duchovny) were growing disatisfied with their roles, and it would only be a matter of time before big changes would occur.  The opening season premiere two-parter ""The Sixth Extinction"" and ""Amor Fati"" appears to try to expand the mythology of the series, but, and this is a stretch, comes off as quite unbelieveable.  The season finale ""Requiem"" is like this as well, leaving incomprohensable loose ends and a cliffhanger that left viewer's mouths open.  The one shot episodes are the true highlights of Season 7, including ""Hungry"" (guest starring Final Destination's Chad E. Donnella as a brain eating mutant), ""Millennium"" which is an off shoot of creator Chris Carter's other ill-fated Fox show and guest stars Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank Black (and we get to see Mulder and Scully have a New Year's kiss), ""X-Cops"" which finds Mulder and Scully in a Cops-esque episode, and ""Theef"" which guest stars a revenge driven Billy Drago.  Season 7 is undoubtadly the worst season of the series (I can't stand the ""Hollywood AD"" episode), but during the time this season aired, it was still the best series on TV.

1832542,5,B000089RT0,"After watching the special features I found it hard to believe that the shows creator, Chris Carter wasn't sure whether or not there would be an eighth season.  This lead Chris Carter and gang to come to some conclusions and closure of certain plot lines within the series.  Chief among those is Mulder's quest to find his sister is finally brought to closure after six and half seasons of innuendo and unanswered questions leading to additional questions.
The ""mythology"" episodes had to take a somewhat different direction during the seventh season due to the syndicate being decimated in the sixth season, leaving only the CSM, Krycek, Diana Fowley and Marita Covarrubias and they seemed to be looking for a new direction during their episodes.  The seventh season principally consists of going back to the thrilling standing alone episodes that did one of two things, provide a good scare with astonishing imagery not normally seen on television or they combined that with some brilliant humor.
The mythology episodes:
The Sixth Extinction & The Sixth Extinction II:  Amor Fati - Continuing on from the outstanding sixth season cliffhanger, Biogenesis, these two episodes usher in the seventh season brilliantly.  Fox is bed stricken, infected with an alien virus that has his mind working triple time; Scully is in Africa trying to come up with clues as to how to save her partner and AD Skinner is doing his best to help both Mulder and Scully while dealing with Agent Diana Fowley and Krycek.  These two episodes also contain some of the best imagery of the entire series.
Sein Und Zeit - This exceptional and extremely emotional episode is part mythology as it leads into the follow on episode, Closure.  In this episode, a young girl goes missing in the middle of the night, just after her father has a terrible image of her and a note is inexplicably left behind by the mother.
Closure - This is the episode the fans have been waiting for almost seven years to see as we're finally and with no small modicum of heart wrenching emotion lead to the end of Fox Mulder's quest to find his sister.  In no small measure, this episode was done quite magnificently and accolades are due for director Kim Manners.
En Ami - The CSM is back and he claims to Scully that he's dying and he entreats her to help him.  This episode is remarkably well written and played out on screen as we're able to see the CSM and his continued ability to confuse through obfuscation.  Of special note is that this one was written by the CSM himself, William B. Davis.
Chimera - I categorize this brilliant episode as part of the mythology because it gives us a look into Scully's past and her present persona in comparison to that past.  While it is a hard pill to swallow, believing that ""by the book"" Scully would have an affair with a married man while she was in medical school, it does show that she can be ""human"" as well and fall into that trap.  Of special interest is the fact that Gillian Anderson, wrote, directed and starred primarily in this great episode.
Requiem - This exceptional season seven cliffhanger stands out as giving Mulder proof that the truth is out there, as you will see when you watch this episode.  The one true sad thing about this episode is that it marks the end of the last full season in which David Duchovny/Fox Mulder works on the series full time!
A brief synopsis of some of the better stand alone episode:
Hungry - This particularly fascinating episode is about a young man who isn't quite a young ""man"" and he has some dietary needs that are quite hard on those around him.  What I also found to be appealing about this episode is that it's told almost completely from the ""monsters"" point of view which brings one to empathize with him.
Millennium - In a manner of homage to the Millennium series, Lance Henriksen is brought on the X-Files in the same character that he played on that series, Frank Black.  Now Mulder and Scully must deal with the Millennium group as the time is at hand.  The long awaited first on screen kiss between Mulder and Scully is done skillfully.
Orison - This exceptional episode brings Mulder and most predominantly Scully back into the world of Donnie Pfaster who was first seen in season two's ""Irresistible"" where he nearly killed her.  He's escaped from prison and they're destined to meet again.
The Amazing Maleeni - The X-Files explores the world of magic and this episode scores big in the humor area while telling a good X-File.
Hollywood A.D.  As comedic episodes go, this is one the series finest and it tells a good X-File at the same time.  Of note is that David Duchovny gets to work briefly in this episode with his wife, the ever gorgeous Tea Leoni'.
Je Souhaite - This is a marvelous comedic X-File as well as we're taken to Missouri and we meet a not so bright young man who opens up an abandoned storage area only to find a ""Jinniyah"" in a rug who grants him three wishes.  The scenes with Scully in this episode are priceless as we get to see her smile a little more.

1832543,2,B000089RT0,"Season 7 represents the end of the traditional X-Files episode formula and the befuddlement of the established series mythology. For every gem worth viewing, it has two or three low quality imitations to match.
The season highlights include ""Hungry"" (7x03), ""Millennium"" (7x04), ""The Goldberg Variation"" (7x06), and ""X-Cops"" (7x12). Honorable mention should also be given to ""First Person Shooter"" (7x13) -- at least for its outlandish action scenes -- ""Theef"" (7x14), ""En Ami"" (7x15) and ""Brand X"" (7x18).
Surprisingly, the episodes penned by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are oddly flat. Duchovny's ""Hollywood A.D."" (7x19) is humorous, but lacks the endearing sentimentalism of ""The Unnatural"" (6x20). Anderson's ""All Things"" (7x17) attempts to graft her own spiritualism as an actor atop the scientific rationalism of her character. As a result, the defining essence of Special Agent Dana Scully is iconoclastically ruined and the episode instead strikes the viewer as a glorified music video.
Season 7 is also significant in that it was the last full season in which Duchovny starred. In a sense, perhaps the departure of David Duchovny was inevitable. The character of Special Agent Fox Mulder had simply run out of steam: his crusade to stop alien colonization was resolved in Season 6 with the destruction of the Syndicate in ""One Son"" (6x12), and his quest for his abducted sister was brought to a poetic conclusion in ""Sein Und Zeit"" (7x10) and ""Closure"" (7x11). Hence, what more was there left to do? Perhaps Duchvony sensed this as well and left the series accordingly.
In terms of mythology, the X-Files reached its true end with Season 7. The Syndicate was destroyed, Samantha Mulder had been put to rest, the Cigarette Smoking Man had become an outcast and, last but not least, Scully and Mulder had admitted/consummated their affection for one another. All the plot widgets had been sown up. Unfortunately, the show dragged on for two more years and became something quite different. By that time, ""the truth"" was gone forever.
Overall...
Seasons 1 through 3 are excellent.
Seasons 4 through 6 are very good.
Seasons 7 through 9 are average.",1057276800,32,2162,5.162393162393163

The highlights mentioned in Amazons review were exactly the ones I would have chosen as the best episodes. Hungry, Goldberg Variation, Theef, etc, are among my faverite episodes of the entire series, and there were a few other notable classics as well, but Season 7 still lands at the bottom of the pile for me. It's a good set for the extras, like all the other X-Files DVD sets, and to complete your collection I say buy it, it is a quality set from a technical viewpoint. But for a casual fan looking for a first set to buy, I'd recomend the first season. For a more seasoned fan looking for great episodes, I'd go with Season 5 for the sheer diversity of concepts and creativity, not to mention some great mythology episodes.",1055376000,2,821,4.337662337662338

Season 7 has taken a lot of criticism from some hard core fans, but there are some stand out episodes.  The mytharc continues from Amor Fati through Requiem.  These will blow your mind!
David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, and the Cigarette Smoking Man himself each wrote and (DD and GA directed) their own episodes with unique insights into the characters they had been playing for the past 6 years.  I thoroughly enjoyed these episodes!
The episode Closure is also controversial as it offers closure to Mulder's quest of finding his missing sister.  This episode (as well as Gillian Anderson's penned ep) introduced many to Moby's music for the first time.

Ten-Thirteen productions had been using a normal television camera, but when it came time to shoot the movie thay switched to a film camera.  Since the movie was shot after season 4, season 5 and all seasons after, were also shot with the film camera.  The reason why people are raving about the widescreen is because that is how the seasons were shot after 4 and they were then cropped in order to fit the standard screen.  Hopefully people will research things before they review what they don't know...that is just lazy.",1051228800,7,626,4.513274336283186
1832550,2,B000089RT0,"Like too many other TV shows, the X-Files simply continued beyond its viability as a TV series. By season 7, fans of the show who originally believed that Chris Carter had some kind of master plan for the ""mythology"" that drove the X-Files began to realize that there was no such plan. The writers had simply been making it up as they went along, and they were now out of ideas. My DVD collection includes Seasons 1-6 of the X-Files, but unless you are fanatic about having the ""complete"" series, I would pass on buying the remaining seasons.
To the reviewer who complained about the use of widescreen on the X-Files DVDs:
Beginning with season 5, the X-Files was filmed in 16:9 widescreen, and it was intended to be viewed that way. In fact, if you were able to recieve a Fox digital broadcast in your area at the time, you could have viewed the last few seasons in widescreen (what Fox calls ""High Resolution Digital Widescreen""). The 4:3 version (for regular analog TV) is actually the one that is cropped for display. Many current and recent TV shows (including Babylon 5) are filmed in 16:9 because they anticipate that either now or in the near future they will be shown in HDTV (for which 16:9 is the chosen aspect ratio).",1051142400,6,1229,4.5656108597285066

Sure, we got some stinkers here, but we also got some classic X-Files episodes that no fan should go without on letterbox DVD.
Classic episodes like Hollywood A.D., X-Cops, and the terrific season finale Requiem, are all here.
Even if you hate almost all the episodes in this set, no collection is complete without some of these.
Requiem alone is worth the price.
And just to clear things up, Fox is not cropping the picture to make the DVDs letterboxed.
After a few seasons the show was then filmed in widescreen. So they are their original aspect ratio. It is the episodes that air on TV that are cropped, as they have the sides chopped off.
So purchase this set, you won't regret it. And even if you do, you can still be happy it adds to your collection.",1050969600,6,916,4.42603550295858
1832552,2,B000089RT0,"There's a separation between what I will watch on TV and what I will buy and keep in my house. TV is something for lying on the couch, eating chips and drinking an adult beverage. I've watched things while flipping channels of which I am ashamed. Strongest Man competitions. A few minutes of Golden Girls. It's addictive.
But then there's what I'll buy and keep in my house - which brings me to The X-Files Season ""Whatever after Season 6."" I say this because I own seasons 1-6 on DVD. But my funds are not endless, and my house is filling up. One simply must have standards of some sort, and the last few seasons aren't up to them.
Frankly, season 6 wasn't the best, but at least there is a natural series wrap in the middle of the season. The rest of the X-Files seasons are confused and disappointing. I remember watching every week hoping for that old Wow I used to get. Didn't happen.
There was definitely a continued emphasis on the odd humor angle in this season, and some attempts at creative staging, such as the documentary style that was also used in a Season 6 episode. But the stories are losing their edge, and what was once creative and different had become entrenched formula. We've been there with this show. Done that.
I believe that the relationships were also beginning to change. The chemistry was between the cast wasn't as good, or at least didn't translate to the screen. It's not as bad as it becomes in the next season, The Season of Skully's Perpetual Frown,"" but it's getting there.

1832554,3,B000089RT0,"O.K, this was it, the date had been set since season 4, that The X Files season 7 would be the last ever season. If you are unaware of this , the reason was that David Duchovnys contract ran out this year and he refused to extend it.
So what went wrong, well Chris Carter, that's what. This season should have been packed with mythology episodes, cliffhangers, and the answers to all the questions that had kept us hooked for six years prior. Unfortunately this was not the case.
Season 7 lacked the darkness that the X Files once held and the ability to constantly thicken the plot line to the point where the episode had you staring in awe at the sheer brilliance of it all. There was a time when the X Files could have been shown in the cinema and people would have gone to see it. Unfortunately that time has now passed.(Compare 82517 in season 3, to Closure in season 7 and you will see what I mean.)
The scripts now seemed lazy and not thought through, the actors no longer had passion to play thier roles and the editing in season 7 was slow to the point that it bored you.
There are a few episodes in this season that are worth owning however, but not many, hunger is fun but will get boring, first person shooter is good but impossible and the one with the boy who can move quickly, and the one where smoking man drives around scully are passable, although neither are particularly well finished.
The season is enjoyable with a few episodes that should never have made the airwaves (e.g Fight Club and Gillian Andersons utterly boring episode} however it fortunately has an excellent season finale.
This is a shame however since it should really have been the final ever episode (and to some extent it was), rather than the cliffhanger carrying on to the absolute trash that we were to be shown in season's eight and nine.
Anyway, this being the last season with anything remotely good about it, makes it worth owning if you wan't to finish off a collection.
If your rich then you might as well get it, but if not I would advise that you save your hard earned money and spend it on something worthwile.
P.S  (If you don,t know the X files well, then make sure you get hold of anything through seasons 1-6 as each of these seasons are worth owning, no matter how high the prices may be.)",1049414400,6,2295,4.387323943661972

Season 7 remains as the best season of The X-Files.  The reason:  ""Sein Und Zeit""/""Closure"".  This two parter is my favorite X-Files episode of all time.  There are also some other great episodes from this season:  ""X-Cops"", ""First Person Shooter"", ""Requiem"", ""all things"", ""The Sixth Extinction"", ""The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati"" and many others.",1048809600,7,605,4.598130841121495
1832556,3,B000089RT0,"I love this show but this season was a disappointment.  I copied all these episodes on tape so I wouldn't buy the DVD set, but I will probably buy this set since I bought the prior six and I cannot be stopped!! First, the acting. I have no problems with the acting of either Duchovny or Anderson. The WRITERS have completely screwed up the characters! The stories are more light. I do not especially care for the flirty interaction between Mulder (M) & Scully (S). The show became a SOAP OPERA for God's sake!! This season has M being a little too carefree and laid back with his job and has Scully wearing clothing too small for her size. Did she get her breasts done or is she now wearing a Wonder Bra to get M's attention? These two seem so out of step in this season. Could it be that the WRITERS got rid of the Syndicate a little too soon and didn't know what to do with M & S? Could it be that M's quest to find his sister was of no use?
Second, the quality of the episodes:
Pros: Je Souhaite (Genie gives M three wishes. Bittersweet episode. Love seeing S all excited over her find and her reaction to the mouthless guy. I always wondered why M did not wish that S was fertile. Obvious relationship change in a scene in the end between M & S.), X-Cops (Cross-over ep. M was actually back to his ""Spooky"" self--all exuberant. S was embarrassed. Funny how M took so long to knock down the door in the end (Maybe M is not so macho.), and the mytharc of The Sixth Extinction/The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati (Diana Fowley is murdered.  YEAH!!! S finally sees a flying saucer. M & S's bond is strengthened. Beautiful mytharc. Duchovny & Anderson are great in these episodes.).
Cons: Where do I begin? Like what happened to the Monkees, when you let the stars write their own material, the quality usually goes down. (1) all things (Anderson wrote & directed. I find it hard to believe that so noble S would have an affair with a married man (she did have affection for older men) and I also find it even harder to believe that, after finally getting laid, she is not smiling when she leaves M. S is majorly PO'd in this ep. I do love the look M gives S in the end.),(2) Hollywood A.D. (Duchovny wrote & directed this ep. Movie  screenwriter wants to use an X-File as a basis for a movie. This ep is a mixed bag. It is a little too cutesy (especially the dancing zombies). It does have some funny moments (S running around in heels is the best.). I do love how Duchovny writes S (she is more happy, giggly, and sweet.). No real X-File in the ep. His 6th Season The Unnatural is sooooo much better.), and (3) En Ami (CSM wrote & directed this ep. S lies to M and believes CSM? CSM wants to save the world? Right.).
Other cons: (4) Fight Club (Two sisters cause commotion. Annoying characters and uninteresting story.), and (5) First Person Shooter (Similar to the movie, ""Tron"" (I might be showing my age.). Way too campy.).
All the other eps are mediocre. I have mixed feelings for the mytharc Sein Und Zeit/Closure.  It is a beautifully shot ep and Duchovny does a great job (No, he is not bored in the ep.). I just hate how the WRITERS explained the Samantha issue. Couldn't they have had M find her alive? I also have mixed feelings for Requiem. Wow, how original...M gets abducted by a spaceship. ""I'm pregnant."" What were the WRITERS thinking of? M & S should have become lovers at the end of the series, not here. Especially since the WRITERS gave us hardly an inclination that they were lovers (other than the sudden spooning scene in this ep which kind of shocked me.).
This season is only for hardcore fans. Seasons 1 - 3 are excellent, Seasons 4 - 6 are good, and Season 7 is mediocre.",1045612800,5,3698,4.331890331890332
1832557,3,B000089RT0,"Like someone else said in a review above, this was a tough season to swallow.
Let's start with the mytharc. Since the vast majority of the co-conspirators were dead by Season 7, Chris Carter and his crew thought it was better to destroy the mytharc all together than develop a new Syndicate with those who remined, like the CSM, Krycek and Covarrubias. What started like a promising new mythology in Biogenesis (Sixth Season's finale) turned into a messy business in Sixth Extintion I and II. Then by mid season we learn that after all this years, and after so many said otherwise (the ABH, Cassandra Spender, the WMM) Mulder's quest for his sister was over before he ever started.
Now the ""Standalones"". Season Seven had two of the lowest points in the show's history: ""Fight Club"" and ""First Person Shooter"", how these two made it to be aired is beyond me. Other questionable episodes are Chimera, Signs and Wonders, Hungry, Orison, last few minutes of Milennium and the final 30 seconds of Hollywood A.D.
Then there was David Duchovny's attitude toward playing Fox Mulder. He had already shown in Season Six some boredom shine through his acting, but in this season (and the few episodes he appeared on the next two seasons) it was too much. In many ways Mulder was not Mulder anymore, and not only because of his acting, but also because many scripts got the character all wrong.
But it was not all bad in Season Seven. Episodes like Gillian Anderson's All Things, the COPS crossover ""X-COPS"", Je Souhaite, Theef, Brand X, or even Rush helped to remember how good this show was.
And Requiem was hands down the best mythology episode this season, and one of my top three season enders. It's also good to know that the follow ups to Requiem were good episodes... all before the show changed the possible alien invasion for some crazy ""super soldiers"", but I'm getting ahead of myself here.
All in all the box is a must for die-hard fans, and even those who aren't should check how high was the production value of this one-hour television show. I hope this new set is packed with extras as good as those of previous boxes. Gillian Anderson's and Vince Gillgan's comments should be good. It's a shame Fox doesn't allow two or more to comment on a single episode anymore (like they did with Jose Chung's on the third season).",1044576000,14,2325,4.673170731707317
1832558,3,B000089RT0,"At this point, TXF is really stretching the relationship of Mulder and Scully and of the show. They have just about took their 'friendship' and 'partnership' into every direction they possibly can, the bond between the two stars begins to buckle into sexual teritory like never before, this is where they begin to become a couple.
Anyway, the stand alones are incredibly weak and tired. The opening mytharc ep's are great, as is millennium, the crossover ep that see's the first propper kiss between M + S, a fabulous scene.
The season looks at the revelation of Samantha's whereabouts in the closure two parter, despite contradicting virtually everything withnesses have told mulder, it still leaves you with a warm feeling and a relief that he's found her.
We also see an experimental episode entitled x cops. Another crossover, which sees the pair followed by a camera crew tracking down an entity that mimics its preys fear, blair witch style.
Other great ep's to look out for are orison, the return of Scully's nemisis, Donne Phaspher, the hair and nail fetish murderer, which reaches an explosive climax, all things, Gillian Anderson directing and writing debut, she takes the pairs relationship onto new levels, as with her character, Scully. Hollywood AD, David Duchovnys second directed and written episode which beats the unatural hands down, Je Southaite, looking at a cursed genie which is the best stand alone of the season.
Requiem then ends this rumoured last season, with both characters investigating their original case, coming full circle in their last investigation together. Both achieve the things they have so longed for. Mulder, to experience an abduction, and Scully to mother a child naturally (so it appears).
This season had a lot to live upto, following the hugely enjoyable season six. It overdoses the comedy, the standalones get ludicrous and the mytharc literally runs out with requiem.
What follows (season eight) is a season returning to the shows horror roots and leaves the show in a complete crisis concerning our favourite pair (there is no comedy whatsoever in S8). Also adding a new formula to the tired show. Hugely underrated, it mixes old characters with new and puts Gillians acting abilities to the limit.
Apart from these season seven episodes, the rest are plain awful. This is DD's last full season and Mulder and Scullys final full year together, so it's worth purchasing sorely for that. Its also the last year of what fans acclaim the propper x files. The show needed a boost, and thats exactly what it gets in the episodes and season following requiem.",1043971200,8,2605,5.0046082949308754
1832559,5,B000089RT0,"Another season of the X-Files is about to be released and we are getting close to The Truth. This seventh season is known to be one of the most difficult to swallow for the fans. I believe that the negative response it got from some people had to do with the fact that there was a big void: there was no real mythology episodes here... the transicion from the old mythology to the new one took place between the second half of the sixth season and the begining of the eighth. This means that the entire seventh season had to flirt with some elements of mythology without really starting a new one. The season starts with The Sixth Extinction two parter. These episodes don't really set new things, instead they try to elaborate around the things we saw in Biogenesis (the symbols in the artifact, and how it came from a space craft buried in an African beach). The CSM returns to reveal something to Mulder and to work as a devil who will tempt the hero with the promise of a new and normal life. By the end of the second episode nothing really important has happened... Mulder returns, there is no big revelation and Scully has learned that sometimes prayer works better than running around in high heels... and of course... Diana Fowley's demise. This two parter proved to be the most disappointing season opener of the series, but it was followed by some really great episodes. Hungry, which turned the focus of the series around and centered itself around the monster, although many thought that it was a bad episode I actually enjoyed it a lot. Then we find other really great episodes like Rush, Orison (Donnie Pfaster's return), The Goldberg Variation (a bit too light for me, but quite good actually), The Amazing Maleeny and Signs & Wonders (one of the most visually disturbing episodes of the season). In the middle of the season we find the two parter which resolved Samantha's abduction. Okay... those two didn't really work... but then we found some of the most brilliant stand alones of the series. X-COPS was just great, funny, clever and new. The always controversial ""all things"" (directed by Gillian Anderson) which kept me looking at the TV screen the entire time... it was that compelling to me (the problem: well, it is not really and X-File, but I took it as a breath of fresh air). Brand-X is an excelent episode: Mulder getting his lungs almost literally sucked out is just priceless drama... this was the first ep. from Steven Maedea. First Person Shooter offers some of the classic images of the X-Files: Mulder and Scully in virtual reality game customs and Scully shooting Maitraya. Je Souhaite is another really good episode from Vince Gilligan's hand, where we get to see the agents behaving in that goofy fantastic way (like in Small Potatoes, Bad Blood, Syzygy and Jose Chung): Scully is fascinated by an invisible corpse only to be later disappointed by its disappearance, and Mulder lecturing the genie in front of Skinner and a bunch of FBI agents who think he has finally lost it. In En Ami Scully is ""seduced"" by the possibility that cancer man can actually show a human side of him... but it could be all a trap or a set up: from William B. Davis' head comes this excelent episode. And finally: Requiem. The season finale that is mother to all season finales... not because of it being the best of them all (which i don't think is), but due to the implications of that final act: Mulder being finally abducted and Scully being pregnant.
In overall, season seven lacked a well constructed mythology arc but it kept being one of the best shows on TV. The impulse that drove fans to the series crumble because of the uncertain future of the series, which forced Chris Carter not to enter completely into the development of the new mythology. But it sets in Requiem the first brick of the second mythology, which got almost half the episodes of season eight. And of course... FOX's work is just neat with these Boxed sets... I am really looking forward that Gillian Anderson commentary, as well as Vince Gilligan's. I have no doubt that the box will be just as beautifully crafted as the previous ones and there is no other booklet as good as the one that comes with this series' seasons (I know much people don`t care about these details, but i love them).",1043798400,17,4291,4.63254593175853

The ANNOYING portions are ""Scully"" who still doesn't believe in the Paranormal, after SEVEN SEASONS of PROOF!? It's so SILLY to see and hear her character still ""not believing"" in things unseen.

It's a silly and foolish concept the creator of the series and the writers drag out for an 'Eternity,"" after all the ""Scully Character"" has seen and been through. This Season, Season 11, is an ABOMINATION as far as I'm concerned. I stopped watching after Season 7. Enough.",1520553600,,615,4.694444444444445
