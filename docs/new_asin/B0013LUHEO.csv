8252146,4,B0013LUHEO,"Thoroughly wacky late 60's, Russian-made fairy tale.  Has a plethora of sub-title and dubbing options, including English.  The story seems very entertaining with a lot going on that makes zero sense, which only adds to the fun.  The picture quality is crystal clear, has very vivid, lush color, and at times beautiful visuals.  Recommended for fans of these Russian fantasies.",1454198400,,376,5.216666666666667
8252147,5,B0013LUHEO,"The movie is great, just as in my childhood.
The English dubbing is pretty good, better than the subtitles version, but the subtitles are useful when it comes down to songs (they are not dubbed).
I'm very satisfied with dvd_from_serge as a seller: dvds arrive promptly (I live in NYC), are in perfect condition and well-packaged.",1447027200,,329,4.892857142857143
8252148,5,B0013LUHEO,"I saw this movie when I was around 10 years old and now after almost 40 years, this movie still feels fresh and unique.
Considering how old the movie is, there is no doubt that the make up, story line and special effects were done with a lot of perfection considering technology available at the time.

It is worth watching and collecting.",1321228800,2,339,4.467741935483871
