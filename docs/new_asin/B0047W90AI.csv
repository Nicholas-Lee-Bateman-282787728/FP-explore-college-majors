4285579,5,B0047W90AI,"This is an intense movie about friends for life, and what happens before and after the Vietnam War....""the good, the bad, and the ugly.""  There are surprising twists and turns that will keep your eyes riveted to the screen.  Talbot Perry Simons gives a phenomenal performance with lots of raw emotional dialog-- and without the enhancement of sound effects.  Instead, there is a great choice of unique music that has been appropriately timed.",1370822400,,442,5.027397260273973
4285580,5,B0047W90AI,"I was moved to tears so many times from beginning to end.  The intensity of so many of the moments, the background music, drumming, thunder just made it all so real.  That you could make an entire movie that kept the intensity going throughout, taking place in one room is truly remarkable.  I especially loved the hearty laughter that broke the solemn mood. It was so real.  How many times that happens in real life. I had a hard time believing that this wasn't a true story.  I loved it.  Thank you, Sandy Rozelman, Author of ""You're Gonna Laugh"", ""Who Said Jews Aren't Funny?"", and ""Politics Is A Joke"".",1351296000,,606,4.513761467889908
4285581,5,B0047W90AI,"I was asked to watch this film and give my review, and I have to say that not only was I amazed at how much is done with so few resources ($$), but that the acting from the kids on up, was on a par with any studio film. Deep and emotional, I cried, I was outraged, I was sad, I was enlightened. One of the best Anti-War films, or maybe more to the point, WHAT WAR IS and how every soldier is scarred in some way shape or form. Vietnam was a pointless war, and that men were sent to kill innocent people, and did, and then when they returned, we shunned then, is a tragedy all by itself. Thanks to all who made this film. Since we are still at war in Afghanistan, we should pay attention.",1324771200,2,687,3.949640287769784
4285582,4,B0047W90AI,"Powerful Story.

For the most part, I agree with the excellent review posted here by RMurray847.

On a scale from 1-10, I'd give the actual story itself an 10+.  Very powerful, moving, and thought provoking regardless of anything else.
The editing, however, was a bit rough.  I felt as if some of the information was revealed too soon, while other information was revealed too late.  Just a matter of timing.  The good news, however, is that it all makes sense by the time the movie is over, and I still said, ""WOW"".  Other than a few scenes that seem to drag on a bit slower than I would have liked, the movie kept my attention.  The acting by all had both good, and bad moments.  Most of the time it was good.  My disbelief was completely suspended, and I was entertained by the story.  Which is ultimately the goal for me.  Definitely worth seeing.",1302652800,4,851,4.454545454545454
4285583,5,B0047W90AI,"I saw this recently and it still pops into my head.  I wasn't prepared for the turn of events.  Great acting, words, music, I could go on and on. It brings back the horror that was the Vietnam war.  You understand what a guilty past can do to you.",1297728000,2,247,4.0
4285584,5,B0047W90AI,"For me this film is like two films in one.  You have the obvious story which is quite interesting but you also have a second story that doesn't really show its face until the end.  Some may see it coming, but most will have to think about it before they get the wakeup call.  This is a story that needs to be viewed by all who have had some sort of relationship with the military, of any kind.  This includes family members, relatives, etc., also.",1293580800,,447,4.223529411764706
4285585,4,B0047W90AI,"The director, writer, star, editor & composer of STILL THE DRUMS, Talbot Perry Simons, was kind enough to ask me for my thoughts on his independent film.  Watching the film was an unusual experience.  I had to bring a bit of an open mind, because although I've watched hundreds of ""independent"" films and enjoyed many ""low budget"" films, STILL THE DRUMS is a different breed.  It's an ultra-low budget film that straddles a line between a home movie project and a film with real backing.  It's a labor of love that was executed on the most frayed of shoestring budgets.

I have to be honest, it took me awhile to look past the low budget trappings and to settle in and appreciate and respect the movie for what it is.  STILL THE DRUMS is a singular cry from the heart...an impassioned plea for all Americans to remember the lifelong price our combat soldiers pay.

This is the story of four childhood friends who went to war in Vietnam.  Only 3 came back, and Jackie, the fourth, was MIA.  Each year, on Jackie's birthday, the remaining friends, Tom, Al & Mike gather to remember their lost buddy.  But at the start of this film, the three are gathering for Jackie's funeral, because after 39 years, their old pal's remains have been recovered and brought home to rest.

The three aging men meet in their usual spot, and as the rainy day wears on, the burdens of their unhappy memories and their secrets begin to weigh on them.  We learn the terrible price these men have paid day after day for the service they provided us.

STILL THE DRUMS could almost have been a play.  Except for some flashback scenes, pretty much all of it takes place in one dimly lit room.  And it's mostly just the three actors.  They sit and talk and yell and drink and their faces are etched with grief and unhappiness.

It's heavy material, and not exactly sprinkled with much humor.  The pacing of the film is fairly slow, but it is moving to its own particular rhythms.  The three men spend a lot of time arguing with each other, but they also spend a lot of time lost in their own thoughts, quietly tortured by their secrets, guilt and memories.  Director and writer Simons plays Tom, the most emotional of the group.  His lined face and habitual running of his hands over his close cropped hair nicely conveys the sense of a man who has not truly enjoyed life for nearly 4 decades.  Richard Fulvio is excellent as Al, who appears to be something of the voice of reason, the least tortured of the bunch.  But one wonders if he has simply done the best job over the years of hiding his demons.  Bobby Figaro is Mike, the friend who most worships the departed Jackie.  Looking a little like George C. Scott, Figaro is saddled with a part that's just a little hard to believe.  His loud protestations are sometimes a bit over-the-top...or perhaps they seem a bit out of the blue, because the script hasn't quite gotten him to the point where we accept him blowing his stack quite so vehemently.

So, sometimes the script is just a little clumsy and the performances not as polished as we are accustomed to seeing.  The sets are sparse, and the visual depiction of Vietnam is not entirely convincing.  The music is sometimes turned up just a little too high.  But the desire on the part of its creator to evoke a reaction, to make the viewer feel the despair and anguish these veterans have carried with them is all the more effective, because the effort is so evident.  This film was actually IMPORTANT to its creator, and not every movie we see has that feeling.  STILL THE DRUMS was a true labor of love, and it's an unusual pleasure to share in that feeling.

The film contains some strong language and some pretty strong subject matter, so it is not for kids (it's unrated).  And it is not for a moviegoer looking for action and a brisk pace.  It is for a patient viewer who is ready to be seated as the fourth person right at the table with these three friends as their feelings and secrets pour out.

(The film also contains a reworking of Blind Willie Johnson's NOBODY'S FAULT BUT MINE with some new lyrics.  It was momentarily off-putting (because I'm so accustomed to the Led Zeppellin version, until I really paid attention and saw how effective the piece really was in complementing the themes of the movie.)",1291939200,4,4298,4.5135834411384215
4285586,5,B0047W90AI,"Still the Drums is a passionate and engaging first work from a doggedly creative writer-director-actor. This is a moving, character-driven contemporary drama with a surprising Vietnam-era back story that has contemporary relevance for a country that keeps getting stuck in wars that exact enormous hidden costs. The film tells the story of three Vietnam vets who have been quietly carrying the secret burden of the brutality of war for decades. The story is told simply, but creatively, unfolding in an engaging narrative that rarely stumbles. The acting, the cinematography, and the editing are all first-rate. This is no amateur production. Talbot Simons and his collaborators have created a genuine work of cinematic art worth watching more than once. You won't find this in theaters, so buy it. And recommend it to your firends.

4285587,5,B0047W90AI,"""Still the Drums"" is a great little story! A true project of love and pride. You should know going in that this is not a big budget, special effects type of action film with a lot of explosions. It is an in depth look into the lives of three old veterans who have been lifetime best friends and who were all front line marines who saw action during the Vietnam war.
These three best friends have been meeting every year on their missing friend's birthday who was MIA in Vietnam for the last 39 years whose remains have now been found. The missing soldier is buried as a fallen hero and posthumously awarded the medal of honor.
So this time the fallen soldier's three loyal friends are meeting immediately after his funeral where one of them suddenly reveals that some secrets have been kept.
Get ready for a very different kind of story, that deals with friendship, patriotism, heroism and post traumatic stress disorder.  What starts out as a simple story about four best friends suddenly turns into an edge of your seat psychological drama/mystery. It had the audience at the New York International Film Festival on the edge of their seats. It beat out all of the bigger budget films that were entered in the festival, winning the top five awards for best film, best actor, best directorial debut, best screenplay and best song and breaking Charlie Chaplin's 60 year world record setting the new Guinness World Records world record for the ""Most film festival awards for one motion picture.""
With our soldiers now coming home after many have served multiple tours of duty this movie's message is so very pertinent than anyone could ever imagine. It's been compared to films like, ""Johnny Get Your Gun"" and ""all Quiet Along the Western Front"",
A percentage of the DVD and VOD proceeds are donated regularly to several recognized veteran's charities.",1289174400,,1850,4.78125

One could view this as an anti-war movie, but it really is not - it is simply put, a movie which touches those touched by war, whether they personally have been in the war, or sent off a loved one to war.  This is definitely a movie to add to your DVD collection!",1289088000,3,397,4.549295774647887

INCREDIBLY INTENSE and TOUCHING STORY! LOVED IT!



I love this film!

The DVD cover says it all. Great story, great acting, great music, great movie!

A reviewer for the movie American Sniper said in his review, If you liked American Sniper you should definitely see Still the Drums, so I went to their website and read the synopsis and some of the reviews and saw that they were donating to veterans and I bought the DVD.

The story about a soldier who is found after being missing for thirty-nine years is really the smallest part of this film. Its the back story that blew me away! I had no idea what was coming and either will you. Im not going to give it away. Trust meIts some great writing! Very original! It had me laughing and crying several times. Very touching ending! The kids were great. They were all so innocent. All of the acting was very good. The soldiers were intense! The three old veterans were excellent! The effects and the cinematography were surprisingly very good. All deserve praise for their work. The theme music, by Miloangelo Adamo is beautiful. The original blues tune and music with Richie Havens all helped set the era. Still the Drums a well produced little indie with a big bang! I give 5 out 5 stars! A MUST SEE!

Whoa! Not at all what I was expecting. It's heavy, but very good. This story about a missing soldier is perfect for today! The three old veterans were excellent! The flashback with the children and the young soldiers were all very good. Great music! This story twist will get you! - It surely got me!

Each had to endure a dark journey through turmoil, loyalty, and mixed messages. The film is a poignant drama epitomizing the meaning of true friendship in the shadow of inner conflict; it represents a cross section of life experiences from the past and tugs on the heartstrings of present day life. Containing specific subject matter that may conflict with the mores of civilized life, this film will leave you with some of your own personal questions and soul searching.

It's powerful and honest, looking past the glory stories to the terrible reality of war. Thoughtful and human, it reminds us that our vets rarely come back the same people they used to be, leaving the physical battlefields behind but not the carnage in their minds. It has touched a number of my patrons deeply---how refreshing to find a story told and a point made without the usual box office barrage of sensation and special effects.",1394841600,,597,4.6415094339622645
