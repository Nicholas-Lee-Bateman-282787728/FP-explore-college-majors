There are many forward thinking ideas that others have tried to mimic but failed miserably at. With Mayhem we have the classic love story of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy must go through hell to get girl back. Our protagonist of the tale, Dino the straight laced hit-man, who eats his veggies and despises the evils of the world (much like a certain Italian Hit-Man who did his sit-ups and loved his milk), is Raymond Martino of Pee Wee's Big Adventure fame. Dino is a complex character battling not only child molesters and pimps, but his own dark past and regrets. Shell-shocked by the loss of his true love Rachel, he crosses paths with the idealistic entrepreneur Ziggy (Robert Gallo), who keeps Dino busy and well informed, as well as, running a escort business for high profile clients that are usually attended to by his number one escort, Misty, the love of his life. Dino hired Ziggy awhile back to track down his runaway love, and because of Dino's reputation as a supreme assassin, Ziggy saw the opportunity to possibly capitalize off of the relationship. Sometimes Ziggy reluctantly goes along on the job, but really does not have the stomach for a hit-man's life. Both characters have dreams beyond the slums of Hollywood where all the dirt settles. Ziggy dreams of Alaska, while Dino dreams of being reunited with Rachel and gets lost in his surreal post-modern artwork that he ponders over sometimes for hours on end. The truth is that Mayhem breaks down the levels of the human soul in a way that I have never seen put to film before or after. One can really feel the pains that plague the characters as they heroically put one foot in front of the other. With each passing day they both search for justice in their own twisted nightmare that is life...",1506556800,,1922,4.655882352941177

8427281,1,B0007M11W2,"I could go on for two hours detailing aspects of this film that are truly terrible.

The best thing about this film is that at most a few minutes were necessary to clarify how unwatchable the remainder would be.  If you make it to minute 5, I urge you not to resist your instinct to stop watching it.",1482278400,,300,4.155172413793103
8427282,3,B0007M11W2,"This DVD delivers what it advertises. You see the last minute of the hunt as the animal is shot and collected. Almost all the hunts are guided and use a rifle.

The DVD gets 3 stars for fairly interesting hunting scenes, truth in advertising and bargain price.",1145318400,,260,4.531914893617022
8427283,1,B0007M11W2,"This is not a video for someone who actually enjoys hunting, the ""hunters"" in this film clearly have no talent.  Most of the animals suffer through multiple poorly placed shots , this film is a disgrace to hunting and is exactly why hunting has a bad name.  This is a disgusting waste of 50 minuets, not worth the money I paid for it.",1144627200,,334,4.285714285714286
