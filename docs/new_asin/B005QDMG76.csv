8483266,4,B005QDMG76,"How about a more obscure frothy operetta? Which is what 1936's The King Steps Out is. It's one of director Josef Von Sternberg's less-regarded works, him that helmed The Blue Angel (1930), the German tragicomedy that made Marlene Dietrich an overnight international sensation, as well as the Academy Award-nominated Morocco (1930) and Shanghai Express (1932).

The King Steps Out revels in light comedy and stars Grace Moore, an opera diva who enjoyed fleeting silver screen adoration in the 1930s. Moore plays Elisabeth of Austria, a real historical figure. The gist of the plot has her posing as a working-class dressmaker in an attempt to distract the Emperor from marrying her unwilling older sister, Helena (Frieda Inescort). I'm not sure this plotline is gospel. Seems like what really happened was that Elisabeth caught the eye of Emperor Franz Josef who then chose to marry her over her sister.

Elisabeth of Austria has been depicted in many stage plays and several movies, most conspicuously a string of Austrian films made in the 1950s based on her life starring Romy Schneider. In this 1936 iteration, Elisabeth - or Sissy - takes after her father, Maximilian, the Duke and General of Bavaria (Walter Connolly), more so than after her stern mother. The Duke has the common touch. He's the sort of hearty gent who befriends woodchoppers in the woods. He's outgoing and friendly. Sissy inherited the same impish quality.

With seven daughters to marry off, the Duchess of Bavaria must've been pleased as punch when a person of import arrives to proclaim that the Emperor means to announce his engagement to Helena on his upcoming birthday. Except Helena is less than enthused, in love as she is with the Emperor's adjutant. But such is the Emperor's command, and so Helena and her mother are off to the his royal palace in Austria.

Not that Sissy meant to be the fly in the ointment (wait, that's a lie). Clambering on a donkey cart, she embarks in pursuit of her sister and mother, partly because Helena had left behind her very important dress, mostly because she intends to retrieve her sister. Except, somewhere along the way, Sissy finds herself pretending to be a dressmaker named ""Elizabeth Schmidt"" and being ushered into the Emperor's presence. Conscripted to her cause is her father, the Duke of Bavaria, who settles himself in a nearby inn wherein he describes himself to the innkeeper as a recognized authority on beer. One of my favorite things about this movie is when the innkeeper, after trying to get the Duke's name straight, proceeds to call him, ""Your Royal Max.""

Franz Josef's (Franchot Tone) interest is piqued by the bold and spirited dressmaker. The movie goes on to reveal that the Emperor isn't quite so imperious in person. My favorite sequence is easily Franz Josef's going incognito at the raucous birthday fair thrown in his honor. See him try to ditch the Emperor's Secret Service. See him frantically try to come up with some coins to treat the dressmaker. See these two royals fall in love, both of them incognito, but one more so than the other.

Is The King Steps Out as good as, say, The Merry Widow (1934), or Naughty Marietta (1935), or New Moon (1940)? Frankly, no. It's frothy, but not quite as effervescent as those others. But I liked it. This is my first time seeing Grace Moore and I enjoyed what she brought to the table. She has that spark, that liveliness. I wasn't feeling the songs she sang, but I blame the lyricist and the composer for that, because Ms. Moore, an accomplished soprano, sang the heck out of those songs. Franchot Tone as the emperor is charming, as is Walter Connolly as Your Royal Max. I couldn't wait for Max to stand up to his haughty wife; that was a glorious moment. I wish, though, that there'd been a follow-up with Helena and her situation with her beau. I was a bit confused with her reaction when she saw Sissy at the emperor's palace. Anyway, try not to pass this up if it shows up on TCM or on Netflix or wherever. It may not be the cream of the crop of its genre, but it serves up plenty of robust humor and convivial company in the shape of a darn good cast. And, who knows, you may even like the songs.",1511481600,,4196,4.702040816326531
8483267,5,B005QDMG76,"Marvelous musical comedy set in Bavaria and Austria.  My favorite of the few films opera singer Grace Moore made.  Music is by the famous composer/arranger Fritz Kreisler who made his violin debut in the U. S at age 13.  Von Sternberg directs.  And marvelously unique character actors.  I think this is my favorite film of Hermann Bing.  Walter Connolly is Grace's dad, a duke who would rather be a woodsman than face his royalty climbing wife.  And Grace takes after dad.  George Hassell, Johnny Arthur, and Thurston Hall are hysterically funny as palace guards and secret police.",1325289600,4,581,4.917525773195877
