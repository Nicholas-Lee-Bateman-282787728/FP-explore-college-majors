8584045,4,B00COQU0LW,"Interesting from a historical point of view regarding law enforcement of illicit drugs and related crime. This 1957 film was based on a true story and played in theaters as a double freature with ""Pal Joey"".",1412812800,2,207,4.777777777777778
8584046,5,B00COQU0LW,"This is a typical Sam Katzman semi-documentary/expose of crime in a ""major"" city.  A crusading Mexican newspaperman attempts to stand up to gangsters who are exporting drugs to America in the mid-1950's.  Decent drama, with some offbeat casting; Rodolfo Acosta normally plays heavies, but he's the heroic reporter here.  James ""Moondoggie"" Darren, normally a good guy, plays a teenage punk who wants to get into the drug trade.

The on-location filming in Tijuana is a real plus.  At one point, two of the principals go to a downtown Jai Alai club and watch a match.  The film is definitely low-budget, but has plenty of atmosphere.

The MOD (burned on demand) DVD-R is up to Sony's usual high standard, properly letterboxed and newly remastered.  This has previously been a difficult film to track down, so I was very happy to acquire this copy.",1370822400,6,846,4.908450704225352
