8667112,3,B00LO1SX1W,"Excellent concept.  Fell a bit short on delivery.  Found the ending to be a bit of a let down.  Still some very nice moments and the empty prison was nicely creepy.  Could have been better, I believe, if they'd put a little more thought into it.",1469491200,,245,4.260869565217392
8667113,3,B00LO1SX1W,"Slasher House is one of those movies whose trailer does it way more justice than the film itself. The tone and atmosphere are still relatively present, but all in all it doesn't live up to the high expectations I first received. The dialogue at several points is utterly dumbfounded and the plot is tangled up in it's own web. Though some of the character's designs are well put together, the acting makes it hard to take any of them seriously and at times pulls you right out of the immersion. I suggest if planning to watch this film, do so with a friend. If this film is good for one thing, it's at its own expense as the only redeemable quality you can bet on is that you'll get quite a few laughs together out of it.",1450051200,,721,4.2700729927007295

8667115,2,B00LO1SX1W,"Red (Eleanor James) awakens naked in a prison cell with a three note piano playing as a soundtrack and the film quickly goes down hill from there. She discovers other prisoners behind locked cell doors with timed lock releases. She teams up with dweeb Nathan as they try to avoid and battle the other serial killer inmates.

This is a film for those who can't get enough of these ""Where am I and why am I here"" mystery film. This wasn't the worst of the lot with a clown, anime girl, and slashers, but the dialogue needed zip and the quick background scenes were amateur.

Guide: F-bomb, nudity, plenty of blood.",1440720000,,612,4.504504504504505
8667116,4,B00LO1SX1W,"In this film which begins in an almost abstract arthouse meets cinema verite style the first thing that drew me in was the use of a singular color shown in almost Argento celebratory fashion against a monochromatic harshness of fluorescent lighting.  The visual approach of this creates a cold desolate atmosphere that seems to dance with near graphic novel vibrancy. It held my attention with its shear uniqueness in artist prominence even as the slow emotionless beginning of the film gave me concern. That is not really a complaint against the film because I have learned when watching films that have a definite almost avant-garde technique that there is a process unfolding. A steady and strong build to some fevered pitch that will climax proudly before a brisk and dead stop. It is something that is both beautiful and beloved in genre film making that mirrors playhouse and expressionist artistry around the world. Almost symphonic, okay before I sound like a psychotic let me get to the point of that long descriptive.  Slasher House at times holds this ability beautifully and at other times tends to loose control during the crescendo to the climactic end. The parts that caused my mind to loosen the grip the film had where mostly during the steady dramatic interaction of the characters at the beginning of the film which seemed a bit cold but however harsh that may sound the part that works about this film is the fine dance between graphic action and character backstory sequences that are revealed in near grindhouse tribulation. If my comments seemed confusing I do apologize but I try to stay open and spoiler free in talking about movies and always approach my opinion based on the artists intend and direction and not on some preconceived notion that a set standard of expectations govern what makes a film work based on genre.

Here is the cut and dry truth of Slasher House and its blended genre styles. It has moments that make you want to turn off and if your looking for some major gore rich action packed spectacle then the film will disappoint you. If however you are a patient fan of Indie horror then you will be pleasantly surprised by cast of characters thrown into this creative story and the true character study perspective that calls your attention in anticipation of the final moments of the character interactions. Yes it is artistic and very experimental in vision playing with elements of gore, exploitation and grindhouse against atmospheric industrial arthouse moments which when it works it works well and when it doesn't, you feel it. There is blood and gore and action and all those things at play in the film when required which satisfies the core of the story which is horror. The ending left me with a bit more questioning as to the continuity of storys major objective but I enjoyed the strange and steady storytelling that unfolds in Slasher House and I appreciated that the main focus was not specifically set on the blood gore or torture of lives here. The film won't be for everyone where horror fans are concerned but as a Indie film fan that likes the elements of avant-garde I enjoyed this movie.",1433462400,,3152,4.801104972375691
