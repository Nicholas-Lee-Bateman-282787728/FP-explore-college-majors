7863253,4,630411902X,"This is a replacement for VHS tape.  I can't comment on the DVD quality yet, but I did like the movie.  This is a horror movie, a genre I do not normally buy but this story has a certain amount of suspense, and a romantic back story which made it palatable for me.  I first watched it on an old B&W TV in my teen years.  It is set in a palatial mansion with an odd front door and a dungeon.",1496707200,,390,3.7777777777777777
7863254,4,630411902X,"This single movie may not be available but is available on the Boris Karloff collection DVDs along with three other Karloff movies. I am amazed at how well these movies from the pre-1950's have been preserved and remastered. Remarkable picture quality and sound, looking better than many movies 20 years younger and newer. Boris Karloff, whose real name is William Henry Pratt, plays a servant in a French nobleman's castle who serves two masters: The evil nobleman and the nobleman's brother, who is kept in the dungeon and has been there for the last 20 years. The evil nobleman hates his brother and is taking it out on him and his daughter, the nobleman's niece, who also lives in the castle, though she apparently never goes into the dungeon because she thinks her father is dead. Karloff knows, though, but conspires to keep the knowledge secret for both their sakes. As part of the nobleman's evil acts he intends to make the niece's life miserable too as part of her father's punishment. He sends his thugs out to find a real low life whom they arrange with black intrigue to bring into the castle and force to marry the niece. Things don't go as he plans, though, so he plans to do the two in, and their father too, by putting them in a special dungeon cell. One designed so the stone walls close in and crush the inhabitants. You'll have to see the movie to find out the details and what happens next. The acting and dialogue are very believable and the characters all convincing. The castle shots are pretty good looking complete with secret passages, as are the sequences with the walls crushing in. There is not a complicated plot nor great mystery revealed, the story moves along with little wonder of what is going on, except for the mysterious but ultimately primitive motives of the insane nobleman. There were no extras with the movie, not even scene select but who uses those anyway. Good restoration, maybe not a classic thriller but worth seeing at least once.  My only question is why they decided to call it 'The Strange door'. There was nothing strange about any door except that the front door to the castle is able to open and lock itself to keep those in from going out it. Featured once briefly in the movie then never again. There were no strange doors in the movie, though apparently very few entered the door to the dungeon.",1437436800,,2355,4.620525059665871
7863255,5,630411902X,"One of the best Classic Universal movies made from the 40's! Karloff in one of his best roles with Charles Laughton playing the evil King.
The writing, directing and acting are excellent in this action mixed with a little horror movie. I don't get the negative reviews at all. I highly
recommend this for any classic movie buff or Karloff, Laughton or Universal fan. A real gem.",1427328000,,378,4.656716417910448
7863256,3,630411902X,I didn't really like this film because it is very old and kind of choppy.  Some others may like it though.,1356739200,,106,4.0476190476190474
7863257,3,630411902X,"Charles Laughton always gave acting his all; whether in high-budget epic or programmer, slumming or rising to the occasion, he remains extremely watchable.  THE STRANGE DOOR is third-rate Universal melodramatic claptrap, not really horror, but it's worth a look to watch the portly Brit devour the scenery (and, in one scene unhappily reminiscent of his glory days as Henry VIII, a roast joint).  Karloff isn't given much to do, except look menacing and lumber around unconvincingly in a couple of action scenes, and Sally Forrest shows why she didn't do many period films.  Laughton, slaughtering French and co-stars alike with an air of wry self-amusement, is the whole show here.",982281600,6,682,5.181818181818182
