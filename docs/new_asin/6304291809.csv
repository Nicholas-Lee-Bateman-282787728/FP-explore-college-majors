7867993,1,6304291809,jackie chan is just in a supporting role and this movie stinks. do not get this I'm warning you!,958176000,,96,4.105263157894737
7867994,2,6304291809,"While Rumble in the Bronx is easily a five star movie, including R.I.Hong Kong brings the total score down. Jackie Chan's screen time is minimal and the production values are low even by HK film standards. If you must own  every Chan film, or you want to see a young chan play the villian (actually  unique to this film) get it. If not try  Young Master or Snake in Eagle's  Shadow.",940377600,,382,4.338028169014085
7867995,3,6304291809,"Well what can I say what you have here is two films one of high standard and another a lousy production.
Rumble in the bronx:  Great fun this one got the 3 stars,  highly recomended.
Rumble in Hong-Kong:  Dissapointing just watch the first one and be happy.",928108800,,257,4.425531914893617
