2175127,4,B0006877KW,"Seller shipped fast and item was delivered as described. Bought the kid drums and he is not practicing. Got the instruction DVD, still not practicing. Oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Good instructional video, though.",1332979200,2,227,5.514285714285714
2175128,3,B0006877KW,"Decent and addresses the subject matter adequately. The fills and essentials are perfect for not only beginners but even advanced drummers.

Worth the money to increase your knowledge.",1312588800,9,184,5.571428571428571
2175129,4,B0006877KW,very basic.  provides a good review for someone who has played a bit (self taught) and also provides some additional plays and ideas for practice/skill building.,1301875200,9,161,5.1923076923076925

2175132,5,B0006877KW,I bought this DVD because I always wanted to play the drums. I started playing right away. Chris explains in great detail how to get started. The lessons are cool because you watch him play then you here the pattern again while the drum tab is on the screen. Everthing is explained very well and the camera angles make it very easy to see what is going on. It also has a great book you access on the download page of the Icons of Rock site. I printed some of the patterns to practice when I am away from my set.,1157414400,27,511,4.069306930693069
2175133,5,B0006877KW,"I purchased the DVD for my child who is trying to learn the basics. I think it helped him becasue the lessons were not ""over his head"" the way another video I purchased was. I also liked how they give a reference library and the lessons available for download on the Icons of Rock site",1125100800,30,285,4.2

2175139,5,B0006877KW,Great video for the beginning drummer. I would recommend this to anyone who has never picked up a set of sticks before.,1376956800,3,119,4.454545454545454
2175140,3,B0006877KW,"Its hard the grade material, unless you have something to compare it to.  By itself, it does serve its purpose, but lacks energy.  And, if you compare it to Groove Essentials 1.0, with Tommy Igoe, the it becomes apparent that video quality could be better, does lack energy, and that the there could be much more material that isn't covered, when compared to Groove Essentials 1.0.  Therefore, I would counsel even the greenest of students to seriously take a look at Groove Essentials 1.0... Sorry, Chris Taylor.",1359763200,4,513,4.873563218390805
2175141,5,B0006877KW,I bought this for our daughter (young adult) who already plays the piano and guitar but has an interest in learning the drums.  We also bought her a practice drum head.  She likes the DVD and has found it very helpful and fun to use.,1357257600,4,233,4.155555555555556
2175142,3,B0006877KW,"Not bad for beginners, but only shows using matched grip instead of classical.  VERY difficult to understand what the guy is saying due to poor microphone placement and sound quality. I would have rated this much higher if the quality of the sound was better.",1357171200,,259,4.7555555555555555
2175143,3,B0006877KW,"I purchased this mostly for my wife to get some tips from it, but she's already somewhat more advanced than the lessons that was being offered by this person. too repetitive as he was trying to show the steps by steps again and again and because of that, will take him long to move on to the next step of teaching. Is good for someone, rather a child trying to ""just"" starting to learn how to play.",1354665600,,398,4.181818181818182

8040097,2,B0006877KW,"I guess I should have purchased a more intermediate video. However, the video quality on the DVD is horrible, the drum teacher looks like Joaquin Phoenix with an extreme amount of makeup on. I guess if you are truly a beginner this video could be good for you. I was just expecting something of better quality than the free Youtube lessons available.",1446508800,,350,4.661290322580645
