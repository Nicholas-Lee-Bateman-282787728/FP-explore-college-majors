8709630,4,B00V8R08OW,"I saw this film on TV about 20 years ago. I am from Louisiana and know all about Angola Prison. It is THE most brutal (and one of the largest) State Penitentiaries in the United States. There are approximately 60,000 inmates. Louisiana has a population of maybe 3 million or so.  That means 1 out of 50 people in the state are serving some of the longest sentences in th country.  It is outrageous. For example, one of the 4 men they focus on in this film (and all are doing horrifically long sentences) was arrested for armed robbery. I know there was no one killed; someone may have been injured, but not bad. I do remember that. This guy was maybe 19 years old, and got a typical sentence there: something like 70 years. He was (at the time of this film) about 60+ years old. The conditions were horrible, and still are very very bad. Prior to the 1990's, I do not think there was any air-conditioning. It is incredibly hot and humid  there. I know from growing up there. At age 21, I was 6'2"" tall and weighed 160 lbs. I used to work outdoors at a place and would lose about 7lbs a day. I drank a gallon of water at night, and another gallon at work. If you EVER get a chance to see this, please do so. It makes the great film ""Papillon"" (1973) look like a picnic.",1428019200,3,1268,4.188524590163935
