All of the Elmo stories are cute and as expected. No disappointment here :)",1331424000,,136,4.708333333333333
4885074,5,B005SH64QE,"I have quite a few of Elmo's World DVD and this one is a little over 2 hours long. Episodes included are Building Things, Birthdays, School, Games, Dinosaurs, Pets, The Beach.  Some of them are repeats of what I already owned from different Elmo's Episodes but my son doesn't mind at all. It's fun to watch and kids just love Elmo. Elmo's DVD are for entertainment and not really educational.  I wish the producer makes more that teaches kids.  I love Elmo's World :Opposites. My son (21 months)watched it just a few times and one day while playing around his slide, he said ""Up....Down""....and at the door he said ""Open ...Close"". Very cute. That is another dvd though.

Enjoy this disc. For a few dollars more, you get double the length.",1330992000,5,739,4.6183206106870225
4885075,4,B005SH64QE,"My son is only 20 months, and since birth we like to limit video time to almost nada if we can.  But as all parents know, when you are trying to make dinner near a hot stove, or get your clothes on in the morning, a little person climbing all over you makes things impossible and sometimes not safe.  So if they watch tv at all, hopefully it promotes learning not just keeps them occupied.  My son over the past month is just now getting into Sesame St, plus there is a $3 rebate for this one floating around (expires 4/3/12) so thought I'd give the DVD a try.  While it's not as educational for his age as Brainy Baby, it does have music, some social lessons, and 95% of babies love Elmo.  I swear it has something to do with Googly eyeballs.",1329436800,,743,4.1678321678321675
