Why do I give it a whopping three stars then? Nostalgia. Also, it's the last Sonic incarnation voiced by Jaleel White,  not only as Sonic, but as his brother, Manic, AND his SISTER, Sonia. It plays fast and loose with the mythology: there's no Tails, Sally, Amy, what have you, the writing's shoddy, the animation and design are poor, but it'll suffice as video wallpaper.

The DVD is sufficient. There are no features, but for some reason we're blighted with a bonus CD of ""Sonic Underground's Greatest Hits."" At least one of two of those hits must have resulted in a severe concussion...",1407542400,2,837,4.687074829931973

8264081,4,B0016Q0ECQ,"This series is entertaining. It has its fair share of problems and it is a little cheesy at times, but since I am a Sonic the Hedgehog fan, I may have high standards.

The plot is about Sonic (Jaleel White) and his siblings, Sonia (Jaleel White) and Manic (Jaleel White) who team up, to search for their missing mother, Queen Aleena and to stop the evil Dr. Robotnik.  I wouldnt say the animation is amazing, as it is a bit choppy and sluggish at times. However, it isn't the worst animated show to come out in the 90s, as it does have a style and it does feel like it belongs in the Sonic The Hedgehog universe. Also, I find it interesting that Sonic, Sonia and Manics weapons are magic musical instruments. I really like that decision, as it shows that the series is a more creative and original adaptation.

Speaking of which, the main difference between this show and the games are the two completely original characters who are Sonics siblings, Sonia and Manic. I found them interesting, but it feels as if they often get pushed aside to let Sonic be the star. I understand hes the main character, but Sonia and Manic don't really get much of a chance to show their personalities. Most of the time, it seems that they are just there to be there. Also, Sonias voice is kind of irritating. Its super high pitched and nasal, and is somewhat distracting.

This show is an adaptation of the Sonic The Hedgehog series. As an adaptation, its pretty good. However, it bares more resemblance to the Sonic comic books than the games. It has a similar setting to the comics and some of the characters seem similar. Sonic even looks like the comic adaptation of him, shorter and chubbier.

Sonic The Hedgehog has never really been known for fantastic, well written stories. Sometimes, the games have an engaging story, but writing has never been the focus of the series. So how is the story in Sonic Underground? Actually, not too shabby. The show has a set goal and some actual character development. However, there is only one season, with only forty episodes and that is probably a good thing. If it went on for multiple seasons, the show would probably turn into a wild goose chase looking for Queen Aleena.

I give this show 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 6 to 13, since this is definitely geared towards younger kids. Also, if you don't like Sonic The Hedgehog, cheesy moments or 90s slang, this might not be for you. It is available now on DVD so, go check it out.
