6305565,5,B00IZ03WRK,"Documentaries rarely generate a feeling of excitement in me.  I enjoy the information found on documentaries, information often not available on mainstream media sources.  Plus, documentaries aren't restricted to sound bites, or quick overviews of a topic to allow time for commercials.  So, I was expecting over an hour of a demonstration of remote viewing, maybe a tad dry, but educating.

What was unexpected was how exciting it was to watch the remote viewers in action, their drawings and commentary and interpretations or insights unfolding.  It makes Courtney Brown's passionate advocacy for Remote Viewing more understandable.

There were a few times in the documentary that I wished there wasn't so much cutting away to another portion of the RV session, where a longer segment of the sampling of the remote viewers teasing out the information they were getting was what I wanted to see.  From the drawings in the video I could see that some of the remote viewers' talking about what they were feeling was edited out.  Of course, that had to be done in order to create a video that wouldn't take hours, but I wished I could have seen even more of the RV process as it unfolded . . . it was so interesting to watch.

The conclusion that Courtney Brown makes of the construction of the Pyramid being akin to crushing rocks in a prison for ""busy work"" is something that I don't agree with.  It doesn't make sense with regard to the mathematical findings, engineering possibilities, geographical placement, etc. discussed by other researchers, and even mentioned in this documentary.

People who are interested in ancient human history, ley lines, ETs, engineering, building materials and methods, advanced technology that may have to do with sound, and of course Remote Viewing will find this documentary worthwhile.

Great reading! Good work Courtney and team!
Via remote viewing, this book scopes and addresses several issues:
1) how the heavier blocks, 30 tons to 70 tons, were cut and transported - not via sleigh (*)
2) why did the construction start and why did it stop
3) who were the participants and their origins - human or not human
4) open issues

(*) My observation: immediately (within few weeks) of this DVD's publication in 2014, a conventional transportation method (sleigh on sand, via friction, wetting the sand in front of the block-transport sleigh to reduce friction) was much widely publicized. With all the publicity, the sleigh method is addressing only the 2 tons to 30 tons block transports; not yet explaining the 30 tons to 70 tons transport methods.

8646714,2,B00IZ03WRK,"The DVD ""The Great Pyramid of Giza: The Mystery Solved"" presents the results of a project conducted by The Farsight Institute to use remote viewing to investigate how the Great Pyramid of Giza was built.  The project also included investigation of some related subjects, such as the mining of the largest stones used in the pyramid's construction and the transportation of those largest stones.  The project was headed by Courtney Brown, the Director of The Farsight Institute.  Two remote viewers were used for the investigation: Dick Allgire, who lives in Hawaii; and Daz Smith, who lives in the United Kingdom.  All remote viewings were done under ""blind"" conditions, meaning the remote viewers had no conscious knowledge of the subject matter of the ""targets"" to be viewed.  The two remote viewers had no contact with each other during the project.

The results of the project are rather mind-boggling.  Extraterrestrials (ET's) were involved in the construction of the Great Pyramid, and the construction included both exotic high technologies and brutal manual labor.  The mining of the largest stones was done by some type of ""drone-like"" humanoids who seem like sub-human automatons in their behavior and mentality, but who could withstand very toxic conditions in the mines.  The largest stones were cut and shaped using an advanced technology by which stone could be melted.  The largest stones were transported to the work site and placed into position using an advanced levitation technology.  The stones would be levitated about a foot-and-a-half to two feet above the ground, and in that state they could be pushed and maneuvered up a spiral ramp by human workers.

I have given this DVD a low rating of just two stars.  I suppose that will immediately categorize me in the minds of some as a debunker and an enemy of this type of research, but that is not my position.  I have a high degree of respect for Courtney Brown and The Farsight Institute for having the initiative and courage to conduct this kind of research.  I think the Farsight participants are all honest and intelligent investigators.  That being said, I have given a rating of just two stars because I believe the claim of ""the mystery solved"" is very premature.  THERE IS A PROBLEM associated with the results of this remote-viewing project, a problem of which I assume the Farsight participants are totally unaware.  The problem stems from the fact that Dick Allgire and Daz Smith are not the first skilled remote viewers to have remote viewed this question of how the Great Pyramid of Giza was built; quite a few years ago a well-known remote viewer named Joseph McMoneagle also remote viewed this subject, and the picture obtained from the McMoneagle remote viewing is significantly different than that from the Farsight remote viewings (although about equally as fantastic and unbelievable from the point of view of conventional Egyptology).  In fact the differences between the McMoneagle remote viewing and the Farsight remote viewings are great enough that, in my opinion, they cannot be reconciled.  That means we have a problem.  Actually we have two problems.  How the Great Pyramid of Giza was built is still unsolved and open to debate, and the usefulness of remote viewing as a tool for viewing into the past is called into question.

Joseph McMoneagle was one of the original six military personnel recruited into a project started by the US Army in 1978.  The purpose of the project was to train and utilize psychics to gather intelligence information, using some carefully structured procedures or protocols---called remote viewing---that had been developed from 1972 to 1975 at a company called SRI-International, under the auspices of the Central Intelligence Agency and several other government agencies.  The project went through several name changes and was finally called STARGATE.  McMoneagle was one of three remote viewers who stayed with the project all the way through until it was terminated in 1995.  He is one of several STARGATE remote viewers who have acquired a certain amount of public recognition since 1995.

In the late 1990's Joseph McMoneagle wrote a book titled THE ULTIMATE TIME MACHINE, published in 1998.  (That book is available on Amazon.)  In the book he discusses some of his more unusual remote viewings, involving views into the past and into the future.  In one chapter he gives a lot of details, along with commentary and discussion, concerning a remote viewing he did back in 1980.  In that particular remote viewing the target was the statement, ""Describe how the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed.""

Why was the US Army in 1980 interested in how the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed?  Actually the Army was not interested in the subject at all.  It had been noticed that when remote viewers had to view a long series of similar targets, boredom could set in and boredom was very detrimental to the quality of the remote viewings.  To counter this problem a practice was developed in which a collection or ""pool"" of targets that was put together for assignment to a remote viewer would include one unusual, radically different ""wild card"" target.  The remote viewer knew this and it was hoped that the expectation that any upcoming target might be a wild card would keep interest up and allay boredom.  The Great Pyramid target was a wild card that came to Joseph McMoneagle.

McMoneagle's remote viewing of this target was long and remarkably detailed.  It included details on how at least some of the Great Pyramid stone blocks were quarried and brought to the construction site.  It included some ""fantastic and unbelievable"" information, not at all in line with conventional thought about the Great Pyramid.  It also left some big unanswered questions.  Unfortunately no follow-up remote viewing was ever done, apparently because the Army personnel directing the project had no interest in doing that.  This was just a wild and crazy target and when the remote viewing of it was completed, it was back to business as usual, getting on with the real work.

I am not going to try to summarize all of the McMoneagle remote viewing, in order to avoid getting bogged down in too many details.  Here I am just going to note the differences between the McMoneagle remote viewing and the Farsight remote viewings, in order to illustrate why I have concluded that either Joseph McMoneagle or The Farsight Institute has given us a faulty picture, or maybe they both have, but they cannot both be right.  I also wish to explain why I suspect---I cannot claim any more than that--- that the McMoneagle version is more correct, while acknowledging that this is just my personal opinion and the whole subject is wide open to debate.  I will also offer some speculations as to why remote viewing might go awry when the target involves well-known and controversial subject matter.

So what are the differences between the McMoneagle remote viewing and the Farsight remote viewings?  The McMoneagle remote viewing gives no indication at all of extraterrestrial involvement in the building of the Great Pyramid.  It does not describe any exotic, advanced technologies.  In fact the technology level exhibited in the McMoneagle remote viewing is generally primitive and crude, although coupled with what seems like an almost anomalous degree of engineering expertise.  The highest technology exhibited in the McMoneagle remote viewing consists of saws and chisels made out of some type of metal.  The Farsight remote viewings indicate the use of some very advanced technologies, but with much of the work done via hard, ""backbreaking"" manual labor performed by humans who were in a ""slave/master relationship.""  In the Farsight DVD presentation there is a suggestion made that the Great Pyramid may have been something of a ""do work"" project organized by extraterrestrials to keep a human population under control.  In the McMoneagle remote viewing there is certainly manual labor involved, but it is manual labor done with some intelligent methods to avoid any truly ""backbreaking"" labor; in particular, the buoyancy of water is used to do the heavy lifting, literally.  The picture I get from the McMoneagle remote viewing---this is my own interpretation---is of perhaps a few hundred skilled workers who definitely were not slaves---they knew what they were doing, knew how to do it, and were quite willing to be doing it.

The most striking difference between the McMoneagle remote viewing and the Farsight remote viewings has to do with the environment, climate and time period when the Great Pyramid was built.  Not a lot is said about this in the Farsight remote viewings, but what is said conforms with the standard Egyptological viewpoint that the Great Pyramid was constructed during a time period when Egypt had become a dry, sandy desert.  One of the Farsight remote viewings refers to a ""glowing structure---in a desolate landscape.""  Another of the Farsight remote viewings describes the construction taking place in ""sandy, grainy land.""  Courtney Brown interprets this last statement, quite reasonably, as a reference to ""the sandy, dry environment of the target structure.""  The McMoneagle remote viewing, on the other hand, gives a RADICALLY different picture.

When Joseph McMoneagle ""opened to the target,"" as he puts it, and began the remote viewing, he found himself looking at a large, calm lake of water, just before sunrise.  A river fed into the lake from the south.  A narrow neck of the river exited the lake to the north, and in that area the river had been partially dammed to create the lake, or enlarge an existing lake.  The dam was built of large blocks of stone.  He then noted the surrounding landscape: ""A jungle of green foliage, giving a sense of a tropical or near-tropical climate surrounded the lake.  The jungle was lush, green, and abundant....""

McMoneagle then noticed two large wooden rafts in the lake, near one edge of the lake.  The rafts appeared to be anchored in place, facing each other.  Each raft had a kind of crude, A-frame crane assembly at the front of it.  Smaller rafts were traveling to and from the two large rafts in what seemed almost like an assembly-line procession, delivering large blocks of stone to the large rafts.  Men on the large rafts were lowering the stone blocks into the lake.  A procedure was being used in which a stone block would be lowered from one large raft while attached ropes from the other large raft would guide the block into a desired location.  The blocks were being used to construct a stone platform within the lake, with the upper surface of the platform just barely below the surface of the water.  (I will have more to say later about this very significant observation.)  Other men with tools in their hands were walking about on the surface of the portion of the stone platform which had already been constructed.

At one point in the remote viewing McMoneagle moved forward in time (while viewing the past).  He noted that the dam had been increased in size, enlarging the size and depth of the lake.  The large rafts and smaller rafts, and the workers, were following the same procedures as before, only now apparently working on a higher level of the structure being constructed.

In part of McMoneagle's book where he comments on the details of this remote viewing, he says the following:  ""Nothing about the dress, tools, rafts, or people matched anything I remember from my history books.  My sense is that what I was witnessing was being accomplished by a race of people who vanished long before our earliest recorded history.  These people probably existed at the very least fifteen to twenty thousand years ago.""

Why do I suspect that the McMoneagle version is more correct?  Why do I favor the McMoneagle version over the Farsight version?  There are two basic reasons.

It was mentioned earlier that the stone platform being built within the lake of water had its upper surface sitting just below the surface of the water.  The workers were taking great care to build the platform this way.  McMoneagle noticed that each of the stone blocks being delivered to the large rafts was finished smooth on five sides but with the sixth side left rough and unfinished.  When a stone block was lowered into the water the unfinished side would be facing up, and when fitted into position the block would be sticking above the water a short distance.  At that point some of the workers, who were on top of the part of the platform already constructed, would go to work on the new block of stone.  They would ""shave off"" the upper part of the stone block using metal saws and chisels until the block's upper surface was smooth and flat, located just barely below the water surface---just like all the other blocks in the platform.

McMoneagle realized that the workers were using the surface of the water in the lake as a large-scale leveling tool.  They were using it to establish a reference plane so that the surface of the stone platform would be just as flat and as level---exactly perpendicular to the force of gravity---as the surface of the water in the lake.

In McMoneagle's book he makes some very apt comments about this, and I cannot do better than to here quote McMoneagle:

""My current understanding of the level of difficulty regarding the construction of the pyramid, at least from an engineering standpoint, is the near impossibility of achieving a perfectly flat and balanced plane in the first few courses of stone.  Attempts at replicating pyramid construction using modern construction techniques and equipment have essentially failed because of an inability to produce this very exact and near perfect plane of reference at the base.  If one doesn't begin with a near perfect base, the difference in weight from corner to corner when combined with gravity tends to cause a pyramid to self-destruct long before it is finished.""

McMoneagle's remote viewing is the only theory about how the Great Pyramid was constructed of which I am aware that takes into account this critical engineering requirement for near perfect flatness and levelness, and which describes a feasible method by which such could be achieved.  In my view that gives a high degree of credibility to the McMoneagle remote viewing.  This is the first basic reason why I favor the McMoneagle version over the Farsight version.

The second reason why I favor the McMoneagle version has to do with a possible answer to a BIG unanswered question with which the McMoneagle remote viewing leaves us.  How were the upper levels of the Great Pyramid constructed?  It seems very improbable that the method described in the McMoneagle remote viewing could have been used for the entire pyramid, as that would eventually require a lake with a depth of almost five hundred feet---more like an inland sea.  However I think there is a plausible answer to this question, and it is an answer that fits very well with the information from the McMoneagle remote viewing.

Within the last several years a researcher and theorist named Steven Myers has put forward a very unorthodox theory about how and why the Great Pyramid was built.  He has written two books on this subject:  LOST TECHNOLOGIES OF THE GREAT PYRAMID: HOW THE GREAT PYRAMID WAS BUILT (published in 2010) and THE GREAT PYRAMID PROSPERITY MACHINE: WHY THE GREAT PYRAMID WAS BUILT (published in 2011).  (Those two books are available on Amazon.)  I have read Myers' two books and I am of the opinion that his theory has much merit.  It explains, in a thoroughly rational manner, many of the truly perplexing features of the Great Pyramid's internal passages and chambers.  There are also some striking similarities between Myers' theory and the McMoneagle remote viewing.

Myers' theory is that the Great Pyramid was built to be a very large water pump (actually two pumps operating in series, a lower pump and an upper pump).  Its capability to move water from a lower level to a higher level was utilized during the actual construction of the pyramid, and was the overall purpose of the pyramid when finally constructed.  In Myers' view the Great Pyramid was a piece of infrastructure with a quite utilitarian purpose, that purpose being similar to the purpose of the modern Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State, and the purpose of a large water tower sitting on the outskirts of most any town in the Midwestern United States.

It is almost impossible to give a satisfactory short summary of Myers' theory---Myers required two books, with a lot of drawings and diagrams, to explain it---but the following quotations from his book THE GREAT PYRAMID PROSPERITY MACHINE give a good general idea of what he is saying:

""The Great Pyramid was built using water.  Water was used to use to move the stones on barges from the Nile to the building site.  This was accomplished using water locks.  The Great Pyramid was assembled level by level.  The casing stones were cemented together to be watertight for the purpose of impounding a pond on top of the level under construction.  Stones on barges were moved up to this pond by a flight of water locks incorporated into the casing stones.....The construction pond was filled with interior stones which would complete that level.  Then the next level of casing stones would impound a construction pond for that level.....Water was supplied to the ever rising pond and the series of water locks built into the casing stones by the construction pump.  The pump consisted of the passages and chamber cut into the solid bedrock.""

Myers' theory may seem rather wild and fanciful to anyone who has only encountered conventional ideas about the Great Pyramid.  However, I encourage any skeptics to read Myers' books before jumping to a conclusion.  His theory does in fact offer a reasonable explanation for some otherwise inexplicable features of the Great Pyramid.

The method by which the construction pond for a particular level was filled with interior stones is similar to what McMoneagle observed while viewing the construction procedures in the lake of water.  My supposition, of course, is that the procedures viewed by McMoneagle were utilized up to the maximum pyramid height possible, that maximum height being determined by the maximum depth of the lake which could be created, based on the surrounding topography.  Above that height the methodology envisioned by Myers was used.  In fact the existence of a lake of water surrounding the pyramid would make Myers' methodology quite practical.

I also have to say, however, that I consider one part of Myers' theory to be flawed.  That is the part dealing with how water was introduced into the Descending Passage of the Great Pyramid, as the inlet line to the lower pump.  The method proposed by Myers is, in my opinion, unworkable, and is inconsistent with evidence presented by the Descending Passage itself.  That is unfortunate, since the bulk of Myers' theory is well-reasoned and well-presented.  HOWEVER, I also notice that this flawed part of Myers' theory COULD BE REVISED USING INFORMATION FROM THE McMONEAGLE REMOTE VIEWING to give a method that would work and would be consistent with the evidence of the pyramid's Descending Passage.

(I am not giving details about what I have referred to in the above paragraph, since the discussion can get rather complicated, and this is not the place for that discussion.  I may do an Amazon review of Steven Myers' book THE GREAT PYRAMID PROSPERITY MACHINE  to explain what I am saying in detail.)

So, my reasoning is as follows.  I believe Steven Myers has put forward a very plausible theory about the construction of the Great Pyramid, with the exception of one flawed part of his theory.  I am struck by the similarities between Myers' theory and the McMoneagle remote viewing.  The additional fact that McMoneagle's remote viewing provides information that can correct the flawed part of Myers' theory gives, in my opinion, a VERY high degree of credibility to the McMoneagle remote viewing.  This is the second basic reason why I favor the McMoneagle version over the Farsight version.

Since I tend to look unfavorably on the Farsight version of how the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed, what do I think might have gone wrong with the Farsight remote viewings that did not go wrong with the McMoneagle remote viewing?  Everything I say from here on is pure speculation, but i believe I have some thoughts about this that are worth considering.

I think a clue to the problem may be found in some explanatory material about this Giza Pyramid project that appears on The Farsight Institute's website, www.farsight.org.  I quote from that website:  ""Past research into the remote-viewing phenomenon conducted at The Farsight Institute demonstrated that the focus of a remote viewer's perceptions during a remote-viewing session is mediated by a telepathic connection between the remote viewer when the session is being conducted and the person who first compares the remote-viewing data to the actual target, who in this case is the analyst (Courtney Brown).""

This immediately brings up a question in my mind.  If the focus of a remote viewer's perceptions can be mediated by a telepathic connection, can a telepathic connection also influence the actual content of the remote viewer's perceptions?  I am not here trying to point an accusing finger at Courtney Brown, suggesting that preconceived beliefs held by Courtney Brown telepathically influenced the content of the remote viewings.  Courtney Brown says in the DVD presentation that he went into this project expecting some rather more ""mundane"" results than what he got, and I have no reason to disbelieve him.  However, the finding that a remote viewer can be influenced in any way by telepathic input from another mind, is something I find worrisome.  In fact I think it might be fair to say that this opens up a huge can of worms.  What about telepathic influence from many other minds, coming from anywhere within the collective consciousness of humanity?

Here are a few concepts that I am taking ""as a given,"" although they can be disputed by any who do not believe telepathy is possible.  Each human being has a subconscious mind, which is interconnected in some way with the subconscious minds of all other human beings.  Telepathy is communication between two subconscious minds, or among a group of subconscious minds.  Telepathy occurs frequently in human experience but only rarely emerges into conscious awareness.

So with these basic concepts as a starting point, here are my speculations.  Suppose a group of people is putting together a set of targets to give to a remote viewer.  Suppose the targets involve subject matter that is well-known to the general public and is also controversial (such as how the Great Pyramid of Giza was built).  Those putting together the targets are giving much attention to the effort, and view the effort as important.  Their attention attracts attention (at a subconscious level) from other human minds who are interested in this subject and hold strong opinions about it.  These subconscious interlopers direct their beliefs at the remote viewer when a remote-viewing session is being conducted (without consciously being aware of any of this).

The following is not a digression.  There is a type of defensive weapon used by naval ships to defend against an incoming radar-guided missile.  A cannon shoots a large quantity of ""flak"" into the air above and around the ship.  The flak in this case consists of many small pieces of metal foil.  An incoming missile that previously was aiming at one target (the ship) is suddenly presented with a massive clutter of many targets, since each piece of metal foil is radar-reflective.  The hope is that the missile will lock onto a wrong target (a piece of metal foil) and veer away from the original target (the ship).

I think the above is a good analogy for what can happen with remote viewing, when the target involves well-known and controversial subject matter.  The remote viewer can be hit with a barrage of what could be called ""telepathic flak"" that completely clutters the picture.  The remote viewer veers toward a wrong target.  In the case of a target that involves something that happened in the distant past (such as how the Great Pyramid of Giza was built), the remote viewer ends up not remote viewing what happened in the past, but instead channels someone's contemporary, strongly held belief or conjecture about what happened in the past.

My speculation is that this is what happened with the Farsight remote viewings.  Why do I think that this did not happen with the McMoneagle remote viewing?  Note that the Army personnel who sent the Giza pyramid target to Joseph McMoneagle apparently had no real interest in the subject and gave it very little attention.  It was just an odd, unusual topic to toss in as a ""wild card"" target.  I think this may have been beneficial.  Their lack of attention attracted little or no attention (at a subconscious level) from elsewhere.  As a result McMoneagle was able to get a relatively clear, uncluttered view of what happened in the past.  In the case of the McMoneagle remote viewing, it may be that we got lucky.

I am sure this is a most unwelcome suggestion to those who hope that remote viewing can be a straightforward, reliable investigation method in all cases.  If I am right, it puts us in something of a ""Catch-22"" situation, when the subject matter is well-known and controversial.  If those who initiate a remote-viewing effort on the subject matter exhibit a high level of interest, give much attention to it, attach importance to the effort---that can end up sabotaging the effort!

This may be an unwelcome suggestion, but when different remote viewers with proven abilities remote view a subject such as how the Great Pyramid of Giza was built, and come up with widely disparate pictures---then clearly something has gone wrong.  Speculations such as those I have made, need to be considered and addressed.  Perhaps there is a way around this Catch-22 situation---if I am right---but THERE IS A PROBLEM with remote viewing that has not yet been solved.",1407369600,17,26318,4.967793513019644
