5351372,1,B009M5014E,"It seems like Disney doesn't understand wind power and how it works. Windmills don't create wind and cannot blow anything away.

Windmills aren't used much anymore. They catch the existing wind via spinning blades. In a windmill, the energy of the wind is typically used to grind grain into flour. The modern version is called a wind turbine. Wind turbines capture the energy from the wind using the blades and then convert that energy into electricity. Fans are used to create wind. Not windmills!!! (Or wind turbines.)

Implying that a windmill (or wind turbine) creates wind is really irresponsible. That is the opposite of what it does.  Children's books and movies should help kids to better understand the world around them, not spread misconceptions.",1490745600,,757,5.088709677419355

Much to our surprise, there is no easy way to put the content the DVDs on his Android tablet.... it will only allow you to copy the product to I-devices (must use iTunes), or devices with windows media player installed.  He is turning 3 soon, and I just can't justify purchasing anything other than an inexpensive tablet.  This thing comes with a onetime use download code and some copy protection hocus-pocus that does funky crap to you computer and storage devices.....

I understand why Disney wants to protect their intellectual property, but, they need to remember that the people purchasing the DVDs are trying to do it the right way or they would have just downloaded it via some pirate site in the first place.....so my advice to any Android customers is don't buy this DVD.  I know my saying this will have little or no effect on the empire that is Disney, but, if I save one other person some grief, it will be worth it.",1419724800,,1044,4.616216216216216

5351554,4,B009M5014E,"Actually, the DVD is called Mickey & Donald Have a Farm (as in ee -yi-ee-yi-yo). It's a collection from the Disney Junior CG-animated preschooler series, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

The signature episode, Mickey & Donald Have a Farm is presented along with other garden and home-related episodes, including:
* Goofy's Petting Zoo
* Clarabelle's Clubhouse Moo-sical
* Goofy the Homemaker (Right on, Goofy! Shatter those stereotypes!!)
* Donald Hatches the Egg

I love that Goofy refers to eggs as ""eggies"" in this episode, since that is what I do with my kids. We even bought one of those as-seen-on-TV gadgets called ""Eggies"" just because of the name (even though it really didn't work very well.

One of the nicest things about Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, is that it brings Mickey and company to TV for young viewers as as warm, Dora-like friends, rather than only as park icons, corporate symbols, geometric shapes or an ""old"" characters. For many years, some kids grew up not knowing who Mickey was, or at least having a context into which they could have memories of him, so that's nice.

The other thing that's great about the series is that we also see characters like Professor Ludwig Von Drake (voiced by the great Corey Burton), Clarabelle Cow (the multi-talented April Winchell) and others. It's important to keep these dear friends from becoming obscure friends.

The package also includes a little garden kit with a package of seeds (I got lettuce), some fun facts and a set of character garden markers. Nice touch for a little more fun beyond the show watching itself.

There's also a paperback companion book of Mickey & Donald Have a Farm, sold separately.",1356048000,26,1664,4.925
5351555,5,B009M5014E,"Five stars because my daughter loves it as much as every other Mickey movie she has seen. Is it me or does Mickey's voice sound weird in this one? It kind of sounds more computerized then the others. Oh well, she loves it and that's all that matters.",1355529600,,250,4.229166666666667
5351556,5,B009M5014E,"My youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and as a parent I have to say that I have to agree with her. The show not only is entertaining, but beyond that it shares some great messages about concepts like friendship, hard work and so much more. On top of this it shares some of the iconic Disney characters that all kids love! This DVD is another great mix of episodes that will keep you and your kids on their feet with some fun surprises in store.

If you have never experienced this show, I highly recommend it to all families. If you have, I recommend this DVD as a great addition to your collection, as the episodes are fun and as always there is some great teamwork that happens throughout and the whole gang works together to solve whatever issue that is set in front of them (with the Mousekettools help of course).",1355184000,,830,4.42483660130719
