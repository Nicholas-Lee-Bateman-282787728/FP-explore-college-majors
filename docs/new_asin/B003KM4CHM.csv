8398790,2,B003KM4CHM,"The video quality is extremely low - roughly that of a VHS tape.  This program dates from the mid-1990s, so anything about recent times is way out-of-date.  Pretty good information content from the mid-1800s to 1990s.  Not as much especially-insightful information on the times before 1800 as I'd hoped.  The announcer did a better than average, but still not very good, job of pronouncing Mandarin names and other words.  Choice of background music and audio is pretty good.

All in all, not very good.",1360108800,,503,4.928571428571429
