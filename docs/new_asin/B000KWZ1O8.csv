2697818,3,B000KWZ1O8,It was ok. Something different. Better than half the garbage you get on TV here in Ausy. Nothing to write home to mum about.,1395187200,,124,4.208333333333333
2697819,5,B000KWZ1O8,"This is a video I would never buy, never watch and never, ever review (they just made me post a star-rating). Why would I want to ruin my childhood memories? I now have the perspective of a 62-year-old man and want to remember the program as it was. When I watched the shows in reruns on TV very shortly after the series was filmed in 1957 -- and loved them! -- I was nine or ten. I can still remember things that happened in various episodes to this day. I had a home a few years back in a somewhat mountainous bedroom community of New York City on the Hudson River. Being a physical fitness devotee, whenever I would be out running on a picturesque pathway along the river in the dead of winter, the grey, overcast scenery reminded my exactly of the scenery in Canada where the show was filmed. I would actually hum the theme song to the program as I ran! Shocking to learn that John Hart didn't die until just recently -- in 2009, at 91-- and that Lon Chaney Jr. was such a cigarette addict and a boozer that he died at 67 -- and parts of his body have been preserved to show modern medical students the deleterious effects of both!",1391126400,3,1135,4.235023041474655
2697820,5,B000KWZ1O8,Should have done more seasons--excellent show--wish we could have more decent shows like this one rather Than the ones that are being made now.  Eva Fenne,1381536000,2,154,4.923076923076923
2697821,4,B000KWZ1O8,"The pilot episode of ""Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans"" is quite good and has some recognizable actors (Frank DeKova and Michael Ansara) but once the series was sold and turned over to divers hands, it apparently didn't ever come back up to the high water mark set by the first episode. That isn't to say the series is poor, because it is entertaining but there is nothing outstanding about it either. I don't regret buying the ten episodes because the two DVD set was reasonably priced, and I rather like John Hart as Hawkeye and (especially) Lon Chaney Jr. as Chingachgook. Unfortunately, most of the scripts don't deviate from one another and there is a certain sameness to most of the stories; those scripts that are a little different aren't appreciably different, and most of the ten episodes haven't aged well. The stories are good for a rainy day but they aren't the sort of thing most fans of early television would probably want to re-watch very often.",1375488000,4,966,4.688235294117647
2697822,4,B000KWZ1O8,"This is the TV series this was pretty good but, the kids would enjoy this more I think. Buy for the kids. Thank you!",1367884800,,116,3.875
2697823,3,B000KWZ1O8,"Based on James Fennimore Cooper's characters, ""Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans"" was an adventure series set on the American frontier of the 1750s, which, at the time, meant upstate New York.  The titular characters Nat `Hawkeye' Cutler and his Indian blood brother, Chingachgook, the last living member of the Mohican tribe, fight the French, their ruthless Huron Indian allies and various frontier criminal elements while trying to maintain peace between the Americans establishing new settlements in the wilderness and peaceful Indian tribes living in the area.

Hawkeye was played by John Hart, a handsome, athletic, if somewhat bland actor most famous today for stepping into ""The Lone Ranger"" role when Clayton Moore left the show for a season in a contract dispute.  Lon Chaney Jr. might seem a strange choice to play Hawkeye's Indian friend and partner, but the burly actor is actually quite good in the role and Chaney seems to be having a blast playing the character.  The last 38 episodes of the series were shot in Ontario, Canada and provide a realistic, rustic backdrop to the proceedings.

The series' outstanding pilot episode was shot in Hollywood with a excellent production values and many top-drawer character actors, such as Michael Ansara and Stacy Harris, filling the cast.  Unfortunately, the pilot's promise was not fulfilled in subsequent episodes.  Sam Newfield directed all of the remaining episodes with little panache.  Newfield directed some of the best ""Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion"" shows, so he was perfectly capable of providing exciting entertainment on a limited budget, but the grind of producing so many programs week in and week out seems to have had a detrimental effect on his performance.  Likewise, the scripts lack the polish and even the wit of similar juvenile adventure series.  Finally the subordinate actors don't measure up to those cast in other 1950s programs.  One contemporary critic stated that the guest stars seemed to be trying to project to patrons in the third balcony rather than play to the camera.  This isn't to say that the shows are without merit; just that other Timeless Media video releases of 1950s adventure series provide superior entertainment.  The ten episodes included with DVD set are:

1.01  Hawkeye's Homecoming (guest starring Michael Ansara and Stacy Harris)
1.02  The Threat (John Paris and Lloyd Chester)
1.05  The Delaware Hoax (Bill Walker and Powys Thomas)
1.09  The Medicine Man (Dickson Kerwin and Frederick Euringer)
1.11  The Search (Larry Solway and Marjorie Pulvey)
1.12  Snake Tattoo (Daryl Masters and Bonar Stuart)
1.13  False Witness (Rodney Bunker and Bill Walsh)
1.15  The Scapegoat  (Jonathan White and James Doohan)
1.16  The Way Station (James Doohan and Rex Devlin)
1.19  The Promised Valley (Bill Walsh and Larry O'Connor)",1248566400,25,2839,5.200440528634362
