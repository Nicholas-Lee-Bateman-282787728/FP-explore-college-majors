8372962,4,B002LFPAE8,"I heard of this movie before I saw it and it made me curious. I purchased the item through amazon and I got exactly what I was looking for. The movie is fairly straight forward and somewhat based off of Battle Royale (they even point this out in the film). The only thing I thought was slightly disappointing was how short lived the movie was (pun intended, you have to see the film to understand). Anyways I would probably recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Battle Royale / Battle Royale 2, more so the latter as they are closer to B movies.",1265155200,2,550,4.349514563106796
