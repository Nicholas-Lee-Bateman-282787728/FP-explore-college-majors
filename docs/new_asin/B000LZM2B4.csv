On the downside, these DVDs are simply copied from videotape. The quality of the video is low, and not up to modern standards. There are not enough controls to easily go back or skip ahead. Foster does all the talking, without giving his partner, Judy, a chance to explain things - even on the women's part!
DanceVision DVDs are much more modern, with high quality production values. I will be replacing my Foster Lambert Rumba set with DV.",1401840000,,538,4.673684210526316
