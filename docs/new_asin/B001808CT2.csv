8268031,4,B001808CT2,Anyone interested in the Batmanglij-Cahill-Marling efforts in film making should see this film and the DVD is the best way as it includes Cahill and Marling talking about their challenges and triumphs.  The comparison of Miami and Havana is telling!,1402185600,,249,5.225
8268032,5,B001808CT2,"The is a penetrating look at how Cuban Communism has withdrawn all freedoms and downgraded every facet of life in Cuba. For most non Cubans in the USA, this will reveal what is often ignored in the USA, namely, just how sinister Communism really is.",1333584000,,249,4.555555555555555
8268033,5,B001808CT2,"I had the good fortune fortune of attending an early screening of Boxers & Ballerinas at the Director's Guild of America in which the filmmakers were present.  So often documentaries are able to stumble upon intriguing situations yet lack a visual level of expression worthy of intrigue.  This is NOT one of those films.
As important a story being told, here is one filmmaker's extraordinarily creative vision for all of us to either sit back and enjoy or sit closer and try to figure out how he did it!  As gifted a storyteller as Cahill ""appears"" to be, what's most apparent is the lack of calling attention to itself (regarding the visual effects) and instead they are only used as necessary parts to a greater whole.  And for me, that whole was to better understand the lives of others' in which I'd never contemplated before, and I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity.",1217635200,5,878,4.756578947368421
8268034,5,B001808CT2,"This movie opened my eyes to social and political issues right in our own backyard.  The directors tell an important, unbiased story that you won't here about in U.S. public schools.  Its worth seeing with friends so you can talk about it later.  The stories in this movie are real snapshots of people's lives and it really keeps you wanting more........like taking one bite of a piece of rich chocolate cake.",1216944000,3,409,4.732394366197183
