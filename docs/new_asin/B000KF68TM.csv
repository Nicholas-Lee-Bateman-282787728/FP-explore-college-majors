8156191,4,B000KF68TM,"Decade of the Fifties covers Seattle unlimited hydroplane races from four years of the ten in the decade. I was hoping for television broadcast coverage of the actual race, but instead I find typical highlight films for three of the events.

The 1951 film is marred by horrid sprocket hole sound, but includes interviews with both owners and drivers prior to the race. In a way, this is the best of the bunch, if it wasn't for the sound quality.

The 1952 film covers Seafair itself with only a bit of one of the most exciting races in hydroplane history. It also spends a whole lot of time giving viewers a good look at the other events that make up Seattle's premier event of the year, not only in Seattle, but also on the surrounding waterways. This is a good introduction, even though it is badly dated. The label on both the disc and case have this listed as the 1952 Gold Cup. It is the 1952 Seafair, which includes a few highlights (not many) from that race.

Of the four, the 1956 Seafair race has both the best race footage and the cleanest picture and sound. It was the first year that Seattle didn't host the Gold Cup since 1951. It was also the last year (and race) for the famed ""Old Lady"" - the Slo-Mo-Shun IV. A true end of an era.

The final event is a cinescope black-and-white television production of the 1959 Gold Cup. For me, it brought back a lot of memories with names like Bill Muncey (who had already won an impressive three Gold Cup races in the Miss Thriftway) and the flying Czech, Mira Slovak, driving Bill Boeing Jr's entry, the Wahoo. The footage appears to have been taken from television coverage, which had come close to reaching its peak, by the use of big lenses to put the viewer almost in the driver's seat.

Unfortunately, the musical accompaniment would have been better for the Tree Stooges or Marx Brothers. Decidedly fair and circus-oriented.

I was disappointed that some of the highlights from other years were not included, including KING TV's Bill O'Mara covering from the 1955 Gold Cup live time trials in which the Slo-Mo-Shun V did a 360 end-for-end turn over at 160 miles per hour.

But, this disc is a welcome trip back to my earliest memories of the Gold Cup.

A word on the vendor - the Hydroplane and Raceboat Museum. They are slow in delivering, largely because it is a volunteer organization. They didn't ship my copy until just a few days before the end of the promised delivery date. Even then, the disc (in a CD jewel case) was worth the wait.",1188691200,,2503,4.485714285714286
