Christina (1626-1689) ruled Sweden in the mid 17th century and was one of the most unconventional monarchs in history.  When King Gustav II Adolf died, she was made queen as a young girl, reared and educated as a royal male, and then took the throne at the age of 18.  She actively reigned for a decade and then abdicated her thrown in 1654.  She scandalously opposed marriage and motherhood and shamelessly embraced feminism and lesbianism (and dressed androgynously to boot!).  She was just a controversial figure all around who embraced modern ideas and defied the conventions of her era in the realm of gender, politics, religion, and philosophy.  But not without opposition.

Christina (played by Malin Buska) is a fascinating historical figure and I was initially excited to see a modern interpretation of her life... one that was not afraid to openly portray her passionate relationship with one of her ladies-in-waiting, Countess Ebba Sparre or ""Belle"" (Sarah Gadon).  I'd seen Greta Garbo's famous version in Queen Christina (1933), and while she is brimming with star power, that oldie only playfully suggests her F/F leanings and instead focuses on her relationship with a man (of course).  Too scandalous for the 1930s!! (There's also a 1974 British version of Christina with Liv Ullmann called The Abdication, but I haven't seen it)

However, this film doesn't really capture this legendary figure with any great appeal or do her justice-- outside of reintroducing her into popular culture.  My first reaction to the movie is that it just seemed like... a bad translation??  The script (translated from French, btw) and delivery often seemed so awkward, like when you read a crappy book translation from another language and things are just off.  Also: Choppy transitions.  Undeveloped threads.  It's not unwatchable, but you'll wish it was better.

I even fell asleep watching it lol... kind of dull and uninspired.  Nothing is developed well.  They fly through her childhood (why does child Christina sound American?! lol).  I had a hard time making sense of all the politics.  And the romance between the two women is just... disappointing.  You'll want more than what you'll see here, trust me-- though it's probably the best parts of the film.  And it's not happy stuff.  Worst first kiss in recorded history!!!  Granted, they had some nice eye contact and good chemistry.  And they're both quite beautiful.  But ultimately, it's just one of many threads in this story that seemed rushed and undeveloped.  Her scandalous behavior invites her enemies to conspire against her... and I just felt a lot of negativity is emphasized about her life.  It's worth a watch if you are curious about her... but I would suggest renting over buying and then reading up on her instead.

And seriously.  What's with saying ""she died a virgin""???  Because it looks to me like she did the nasty with ol' Belle a-plenty....",1450137600,28,2933,5.022821576763485

7455758,4,B0161TTGAI,"This movie's costumes, sets, and acting were all superb. I'm a history buff, and I've found that a lot of queer history has been deleted over time. It was refreshing to see a story represent a queer female queen so unabashedly and I enjoyed this film, overall.

If you know anything about her history, this film remains true to Queen Kristina and (SPOILER) her descent into madness. The actress playing Kristina, Malin Buska, needs a little time to warm up to. However, the woman playing Kristina's handmaiden (Sarah Gadon) is, for me, the highlight of the movie; her subtle expressions and emotion bring warmth to Kristina and their relationship and gravity to (more spoilers) the eventual end of it.

The reason I'm only giving four stars here as opposed to five is, like everything else in the media today, it doesn't have a happy ending. To me, it helped a great deal knowing that the ""lesbians don't have a happy ending"" because it enabled me to lower my (albeit naive) expectations. Thankfully, I read reviews from other customers before watching the movie. Objectively, it was a pretty good film; again, Sarah Gadon's performance was the focal point for me. I'd just like to watch a ""lesbian movie"" where there isn't a tragic ending. One can only hope, right?",1483401600,3,1266,4.802752293577981

7455761,2,B0161TTGAI,"I normally do not write reviews but this film fell far short of being the stark drama of one of the most alluring and enigmatic women in history. I found the storyline and poorly translated script extremely disappointing and completely lacking in continuity and plausibility. I would have given it only one star were it not for the excellent photography and costuming. The lead actress's performance came across as very wooden and amateurish. Her lack of elocution and inflection skills made for a performance that was far from being one of breathtaking reality and expertise. The nuances that the actress playing her Lady In Waiting brought to her role were pretty much limited to her being naieve and starry-eyed. The acting was otherwise fine. But for the first 1/2 hour or so, Christina was for the most part portrayed as not that of a strong-willed woman but of someone mentally unstable and weak. The lesbian relationship was lacking in character development and chemistry. Nevertheless, I had hoped that the director, who had taken so much liberty in other aspects of the film, would have provided the viewer with a happy ending for the two women. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The heavy dose of religion and philosophy complete with an incomprehensible and gratuitously gruesome scene involving brain surgery on a male cadaver overwhelmed what little interest I had left in this film. If you like classic movies then I recommend Greta Garbo's Queen Christina in its stead. This film's quality may be dated by comparison but Garbo's androgynous charm, stunning good looks (haunting eyes - mesmerizing in the last scene) and tour-the-force performance will not disappoint.",1478736000,12,1686,5.090252707581228

7455763,4,B0161TTGAI,"The movie starts off kind of slow but picks up its pace as continues.  I paused it partway through so I could check the web for a summery biography.  From what I read, the movie, although fictionalized appears to follow along with her life.  And even in the 1600's, royalty did not have total and complete command
A beautiful, if sad, film.  The actors were all excellent to the point where I was really into the storay and forgot totally that it was just a fictional film.  If you enjoy historical fiction and are open to alternate lifestyles, this movie is well worth seeing.
Suggestion: read a short biography (such as in Wikipedia) before watching.  You will get much more out of it.",1476230400,2,687,4.544715447154472

Otherwise, though, its script is mediocre and performances are overwrought and overacted by some accomplished scenery-chewers.  But, psst!  Can we talk?  For those of us (like me) who are interested in this film solely because Francois Arnaud is among the cast members, well, lemme tell ya!  Near the end of this film is a delightful surprise, which I can only think is the movie maker's gift to the fans for having sat through this otherwise unrewarding work.

7455770,4,B0161TTGAI,"Kristina inherited the throne of Sweden at the age of six when her father dies in the religious wars that gripped Europe in the Seventeenth Century i.e.; fighting Papism. Her father had brought her up as a prince and she was accustomed to manly pursuits. Taken under the wing of Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna played brilliantly by Michael Nyqvist  (100 Code and Europa Report).

She however has a mind of her own and is taken by the new thinking and philosophers of the time like Rene Descartes all of which are rejected by the austere Protestantism that her country has fought for. She also is a bit opposed to marriage and the many courtiers that come a wooing her. Contrastingly she is  enamoured with a certain Lady in Waiting and soon is breaking with more than one convention in pursuit of what she really wants.

Now this is a pan European production but is mainly in English with a tad of German and French. The acting is all top notch and the period detail is spot on too. This though is a personal view of the woman rather that a wider view of European politics and so is told on a smaller canvas than I was expecting. That said it is thoroughly watchable and is a noteworthy production  I wish it had been in Swedish though but English is now the Lingua Franca it would appear  so this is one that should appeal to lovers of modern European cinema who like a bit of spice in their lead roles.",1469836800,,1401,4.410852713178294

7455772,2,B0161TTGAI,Very disappointing.  Queen Christina is a prominant and interesting historical character and this program made her look like a petulant teen.

7455774,2,B0161TTGAI,"After viewing the film, did a little research on Christina herself and conclude that this movie pastes 21st century culture on top of what was indisputably a fascinating and dramatic 17th century life. First of all, the Queen is Hollywood-beautiful, great face, perfect form, strutting about like a runway model trying to look ""sporty"" sometimes without much makeup. History says otherwise - her ribald personality and brilliance, even humor, were at the core of this Queen's true story. What could have been a fascinating portrayal of a woman history records as obsessed with ideas, fluent in 6 or 7 languages, surrounding herself with intellectuals and conversation, fostering music, dance and art - was instead a series of scenes (with melodramatic scores) of brow-furrowed brooding, dark and stormy nighttime horse riding, strange, stressed-out dialogue; scenery-chewing angst over religion, the meaning of passion, pleasure, and even an incoherent set piece with forbidden satanic literature. This Queen's historically documented rejection of femininity provided this director an irresistible opportunity to create some scenes of lesbian passion that were just too pretty and not quite believable.",1465862400,,1202,5.6464088397790055

7455776,3,B0161TTGAI,"This movie is a period bio pic of Queen Christina of Sweden. At her father's express request, she had been raised as if she were a prince rather than a princess, as she was his heir. So, she was highly educated. Consequently, she grew up to be a fascinating, learned woman with a mind of her own. She fell in love with a countless, Belle, to the consternation of her Court. She was also interested in Catholicism, which was considered heretical in Lutheran Sweden. She championed education and peace, two goals that were held in disfavor by her nobles. Hers was a difficult reign, a fact which the film conveys. It was no wonder that she finally did the unthinkable.

The film stays fairly on course in terms of sticking to the facts of her most interesting life but it seems too bent on emphasizing her sexuality. This queen was far more than just an unhappy, thwarted  lesbian, which is how I see her depicted in this film. Instead, she was a brilliant woman ahead of her time, who may also have been a lesbian. So, I prefer the Greta Garbo version of this Queen's story. Notwithstanding this criticism of the film, the cinematography is excellent, as are the costumes, and the cast is talented. The cast would occasionally lapse into French, however, but no subtitles were provided, which I found somewhat annoying.

Those who enjoy period pieces or historical dramas will derive a modicum of enjoyment from this film.",1463529600,,1421,4.676

I recommend it to some people who like historical period drama, but it definitely isn't for everyone. I apologize for a prior review in which I said it was for everyone. I don't know what I was thinking, as it most definitely is NOT for everyone.

Queen Christina of Sweden was apparently wise and shrewd beyond her years, and could very admirably take care of herself intellectually and in combat. However, she had a fatal flaw, which is usually the case in good drama. She was an amazing woman, and definitely danced to her own tune, and she often confounded the expectations of those around her. This caused intrigue and tension in her environment, and eventually led her to make a dramatic, surprising, although ingenious decision at the end.

I ought to add, for disclosure's sake that this is produced by a studio that apparently specializes in LGBT oriented films, and it is NOT your average boy/girl romance. I'd say there are twists and turns in the story line, but in the end she finds an original, unexpected solution to her predicament in general that I found astonishing, and inspiring.

How much of this story follows history, and how much is entirely fictionalized, I'm sorry I cannot comment on this, but I do enjoy historic fiction, and all things considered, I found this film to portray an intriguing story, although for a specific audience. Furthermore, I would not really recommend this one for children at all. Although it seemed beautifully done, overall, the subject matter and some of the scenes were definitely not for children.

I connected with the story line and I was routing for her love life and her success. The men wouldn't let her be successful, they didn't want it. That was obvious, being it is a patriarchal society. She ended her life doing what she loved, or so it seemed in the movie. A man became king and everybody go what they wanted (maybe?)",1450915200,2,447,4.270588235294118
7455834,5,B0161TTGAI,"To be honest, I was a little hesitant to watch this movie because it had a couple of negative reviews on other sites, but, I am so glad I did. Before I watched this movie I didn't know anything about Queen Kristina so after I watched it I did a bit of research on her to see how accurate it was on film. I think they did a really good job at capturing the essence that made Kristina who she was. Not only was she a true pioneer in her time for going against the grain of conventional male thinking of how a woman should be, but she also seemed to make things better for her countrymen by ending a 30 year long religious war.

What I enjoyed the most in the movie, though, was the love story between Kristina and her ""bed fellow"" Ebba 'La Belle'. They really did a great job showing that love is universal and flows fluidly century after century. The actresses also did a great job at making it believable. I think they had amazing chemistry and it really showed in their intimate scenes. Its rumored that the two actresses may have been an item in real life which may or may not be true, but if they are that could certainly explain the chemistry they had.

Overall a really good movie that I thoroughly enjoyed!",1450396800,11,1212,4.242424242424242

Someone recommends watching Garbo's Christina. I've never been a fan of Garbo, whereas I like Malin Buska a lot. (she won Best Actress at Montreal World Film Festival) Also, being somewhat of an intellectual, I was glad to see a film that included Descartes, and his time in Sweden. I might watch it again.",1530403200,,467,4.379310344827586

8735412,3,B0161TTGAI,"The director Mika Kaurismki has said that The Girl King is not intended as a traditional epic costume film but as an intense, actor-centered, psychological drama. It doesn't always succeed, but I appreciate the effort; we don't have nearly enough biopics of historical Nordic female rulers.
The lead actress was perhaps too inexperienced for the role, but Sarah Gadon's performance as Countess Ebba Sparre was wonderful. My main complaint is that most of the events feel almost claustrophobically centered on the castle; we see only a few glimpses filmed elsewhere. On the other hand, kudos for using the actual, historical sites in Finland (Turku castle, cathedral, old town) - you don't see them on screen that much.",1503100800,,718,5.145299145299146
