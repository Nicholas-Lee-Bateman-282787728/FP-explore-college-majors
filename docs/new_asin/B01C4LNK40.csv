8752217,3,B01C4LNK40,"The image of rose on the menu page is a bit blurred, I have the same feeling for the music itself. Some sounds make negative impact on my feelings, comparing to Quite Winter Nights (2L.no) or Moonlight Acoustica this music misses something - for me. My wife is a professional massage therapist, she said this music is not relaxing, and she used a lot of meditation music sources in her practice. I use pretty good surround system, and the quality of record is not an issue on this disk, it is recorded pretty good, not perfect, but good.
It is the music itself, I don't know how to express my feelings, but it is neither relaxing nor involving for me. It is rather troubling - like Scottish pipes music. No way it can be used for massage, reflexology or meditation. I can not imagine when I will deside to listen to this disk again.
Of course, this is a personal opinion.",1515628800,,871,4.416149068322981

8752220,5,B01C4LNK40,"I love this. I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it but I love most of the tracks. It's very relaxing with wonderful bass and an immersive mix. Sadly I only have 5.1 capability. I'd love to hear this in auro, but I don't feel like I'm missing out, I just know it could be even better. It's great for meditation or just calming you mind for bed. I usually pass out before it's over. That's a good thing. Recommended.
Edit: now auro enabled. sounds wonderful! Really expands the experience",1468281600,,475,4.409090909090909

8752222,4,B01C4LNK40,"I dig this album. I put it on a lot when I need to chill out. The mix is quite discrete. It has me contemplating the upgrade from 7.1 to 9.1.
For massage music, it is quite interesting stuff. Not just a bunch of dreamy chords. There are pleasant melodies and soundscapes.
The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is the Pure Audio format. It's a waste of Bluray space. Throw some video on there. An interview. A documentary. Anything. BD-V can still play back lossless audio. That's my only fuss. Musically, this is very satisfying.",1464480000,2,533,4.448979591836735
