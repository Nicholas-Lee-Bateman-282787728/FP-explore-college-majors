It was short sweet and we wished it was longer. Are there anymore?
We can't wait to go back to Italia! I am thankful to have this man do the filming . . .!
I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't take themselves seriously. We have all the SERIOUS dvds too. This one was pure delight!",1225324800,,450,4.125
