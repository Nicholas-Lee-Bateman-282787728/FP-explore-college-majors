708116,3,6303675484,"My current fitness level is less than satisfacory and yet I found this video too easy. My abs, buns and thighs weren't even a bit sore the day after. The video is mostly aerobic, and good for a short routine during the  day, but for body sculpting - not enough.",951868800,3,261,4.22
708117,5,6303675484,"Even though its only 25 minutes, this tape gives an intense lower body workout. Cardio routines are alternated with toning intervals. It's dance oriented but easy to follow and the music is very jazzy and upbeat. I loved  every minute of it! I like to alternate this tape with Jane's ""Total  Body Sculpting"" tape for a more balanced workout.",923011200,8,341,4.762711864406779
708400,4,6303675484,"I loved Jane Fonda.  She is the original.
This is not my favorite tape of her's but I still like it.  I really enjoyed her workout partner Kim who is adorable & cues flawlessy.  Jane on the other hand gave little attention to her cueing.  My only other complaint is the video seems rushed.
The workout is broken into two for alternating.  The floor aerobics are good if you want a really quick workout.  The toning for the lower body is good, not too difficult.  I would suggest this workout for a beginner or for someone who wants a break from stepping & who wants an easy workout.  Leave lots of room in your living room for back & forth movements.",1021766400,3,650,4.31404958677686
708401,5,6303675484,"This is my favorite exercise video.  The format (two 25 minute workouts with alternating aerobics and strength sections) is perfect.  I love this tape because it doesn't take up much time.  Each workout session is difficult, you really feel it, but not so difficult to make you never want to do it again.  Jane is a great instructer as well.  Overall, a great tape for people who hate to exercise and want to get an intense workout in a minimum of time.",1014940800,5,453,4.475609756097561
708402,5,6303675484,"I love the workout you get for such a short time. In 25 minutes you burn calories, tone up with legs and buns with squats and lunges. After all that you do some abs that is great for beginners and people who are advanced.
I worked out with Jane for over a year and lost 35 pounds! I have several of her tapes and I think the music and moves are easy to learn and so fun to do! I just recently had a baby, so I have to get back into the groove again but I won't have a problem as long as Jane is my personal trainer!",1005350400,4,515,3.7339449541284404
708403,4,6303675484,"I've never been a physically active person but have always been naturally thin and toned... until recently.  Now approaching 30, the 'flabs' have offically hit.  I purchased this tape with the goal to tone and strengthen muscle tone -- if I lose weight, great, if not, no biggie.  So far, it's served its purpose.  I felt the steps were easy to follow, the pace just about right, but all challenging enough to break into a good sweat and not feel fatigued after.  It's only been a couple weeks but I can feel and see results already.  I'm so pleased, I plan on purchasing the entire Personal Trainer set.  I would recommend this tape to those who are in the beginner/intermediate range, advanced folks will probably not find the steps challenging enough.",989280000,2,754,4.709923664122138
708404,5,6303675484,"I really enjoyed this workout, it left me feeling like I'd had a good workout, but without feeling totally ""dead"". Since I have never exercised IN MY LIFE before (!!) I did have trouble keeping up with all the moves, but I'm sure I'll get into it, since the moves are simple, repetitive, and quite easy to follow. It was a great place to start. The music is not that great, but if it had been louder or had there been too much beat, I may not have been able to hear the instructors properly. I would really recommend this to anyone who needs a good workout.",979689600,2,557,4.214953271028038
708405,3,6303675484,"That's what I wonder whenever I do this tape.  I think, ""Hmmm, Jane Fonda must have experts who have designed this video..."" but it seems so easy and I frequently say out loud to the tee vee ""BORING!""  I'm new to the home video workout thing and I wonder if there are any  videos out there that can inspire a person to keep on keepin' on.  So far I  haven't found it.  I've stuck with this one for a week and my interest is  waning.  To me, the biggest problem is the music which should inspire you  to add that extra oomph or go the extra step.  This doesn't happen with  this video or frankly with any other exercise video I've tried.  I will  keep looking for the exercise video that I will return to with gusto.",958953600,6,715,4.131386861313868
708406,5,6303675484,"For someone at an advanced level these routines would be a little boring, since they are very repetitive, but this is what makes them easy to learn.  With two workouts per tape you can alternate them ""for variety and for  fun.""  It is easy to see how to do either the high or low impact  variations, unlike most other aerobics videos which only occasionally show  the low impact version.  The toning exercises between the aerobics make the  workout feel more complete, and are a nice break, although they are very  challenging.  This could serve as the only exercise video you own, since it  includes both aerobics and toning, but alternating it with Total Body  Sculpting gives a more complete workout.",955411200,12,703,4.775
708407,5,6303675484,"I love this video.  I have used it after the birth of each of my three children and I see results everytime.  I gained a lot of weight with each pregnancy (50+ lbs) and this workout alone helped me get it all off plus  some.  It is a nice easy to follow workout that will make you sweat.  I  like that you have a choice of high or low impact, so you can ease yourself  back into working out if you have been out of it for a while or if you're  just beginning.  The toning exercises are great and you definitely feel it  afterward.  These are two great 30 minute routines that you can fit into a  busy day.  I put my baby in the swing and the older kids watch or join me.  I would definitely recommend this to mothers who don't have time to get to  the gym, but not to those who are more advanced and are expecting a  hardcore workout.",952473600,21,834,3.963636363636364

7853191,5,6303675484,"I've owned this VHS for many years and used it until it gave out on me. It's the best of her whole,exercise series, and it targets all my problem areas, including back and upper back. I didn't think I would find another one.",1381276800,,224,4.232558139534884
7853192,3,6303675484,I have not used this VHS because I ordered it in error.  I was delighted when I saw this particular DVD (I thought).  Only after processing the invoice did I realize it was not a CD.  My mistake.,1322956800,,195,4.078947368421052
7853193,5,6303675484,"i can see where this dvd would not be challenging for someone who prefers advanced workouts. the steps are easy (once learned) so if you are looking for major challenge then look elsewhere. i on the otherhand have never participated in aerobic excercises until over a month ago when i purchased this dvd. i was looking to tone up my legs which i find is exactly what is happening. i started by alternating both segments for the first 3 weeks, then i combined both workouts in one day to provide me with a 50 minute workout. I follow the high intesity level for the most part. it gets me a bit breathless and does break me into a sweat by the second workout. the toning segments are intense and for the first couple of weeks i was sore - but now, i feel the difference - i can still feel ""the burn"", but am growing stronger. eventually i will alternate this with something a bit more challenging but do plan on continuing it for the calorie burning benefits.",1128470400,,957,4.382022471910112
7853194,3,6303675484,"This video is supposed to contain excercises to sculpt your abdominals, buns, and thighs, the problem is they spend little time doing exackly that!  They spend half of each 25 minute workout doing stupid aerobics, that hardly raise your heart rate, and don't make you sweat.  The thigh work is fairly good. The buns are worked once and way too fast.  This video  is not good for sculpting your abs at all, they do that way too fast, and last thing.  Overally, this video is not for sculpting your abs,or buns. if you want a good lower body video, try Jane Fonda's Lower Body Solution, stay away from this one.",1115424000,,609,4.5
7853195,5,6303675484,"This video includes two 20 minute workouts which combine aerobics with toning segments. This is one of Jane Fonda's best videos. Jane gives good instruction, and the other two instructers are just as motivating! Low enough impact for beginners, and challenging enough for intermediates. The choreography is simple to follow and the music keeps you motivated! This workout is great for those who don't have much time to exercise!",1064361600,,428,5.217391304347826
7853196,3,6303675484,"The video has two separate 25 minutes work-outs, with aerobic and exercises for hips,buns and abs. I bought this video when I was 16 and had never exercised before. The first times I couldn't complete the full 25 minutes, but after doing it every day for a couple of weeks I could see my tighs getting firmer. After a year, I started joging etc and stopped using the tape.
Now I'm 20. At the end of this summer i picked up the tape agin and began exercising with it. It's really not a challenge if you're not a beginner anymore. Now, I do both of the separate 25 minutes work-outs together, but still don't feel I've got a good workout. The exercises for legs and bun are quite good, but Jane pays too little time on the abs. The instructors are very sweet and keep you motivated, but I would only recommend it for beginners.",1036540800,4,825,4.329032258064516
