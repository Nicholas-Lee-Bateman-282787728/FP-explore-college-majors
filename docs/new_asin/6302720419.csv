500173,4,6302720419,"When CHILDREN OF THE CORN was released I was working as a theater manager in Indianapolis. I had access to most movies coming out, was an avid fan of horror films and when I couldn't see them that way would rent them since this was the early age of the VCR. When I heard that a new movie was coming out based on a Stephen King novel I looked forward to it, expected to be chilled to the bone. The end result was entertaining but not quite that frightening.

The story opens with a town in which all of the young people for reasons as yet unexplained kill off the adults. They do so at the behest of Isaac (John Franklin), a holy roller styled child preacher. Fast forward to several years later was young couple Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) are on their way to Burts new job as a doctor. Driving through the fields of corn they hit a young boy standing in the middle of the road. Burt realizes he didn't die from the accident but from a slit throat so the couple go searching for help.

They find themselves directed to the tiny town of Gatlin with its empty streets and corn stalk filled cars and stores. Eventually they come across two small children, our movie narrators, who don't tell them much. When the rest of the youth find them they capture Vicky and plan to offer her as a sacrifice. Will Peter be able to rescue her? Will he discover what is actually going on in this town? And will the evil that has been behind it all be revealed?

Based on a short story the plot is fairly simple and the story here is as well. It involves a lot of moving from one place to another and listening to two factions in the town struggling with one another: Isaac the long term leader who has controlled it from the beginning and the devout follower Malachi (Courtney Gains) who thinks things haven't gone far enough. Their struggle is as menacing to watch as is the deaths theyve perpetrated and now prepare for.

The acting here is what one would expect from two pros like Horton and Hamilton. Both were well on their way to stardom when making this film, he on TVs THIRTYSOMETHING and she in the TERMINATOR films. What makes this movie stand out though is the performances of the young people involved. Franklin (although older than he looks) is the perfect fit for the character of Isaac. And Gaines looks like the local skateboard teen who could be trouble but in this case carrying a butcher knife and proving that he is.

For being a horror film as well as one with an R rating there is very little in the way of blood or gore here and no nudity at all which makes one wonder why the MPAA would choose to pass this off with that rating. In the extras even the producers were stunned by the rating which was given without any explanation as to how to fix it. In any event, fans of the film and of Stephen King will want to pick this one up.

That being said with a blu-ray edition out earlier why would anyone pick up this one? Two words: Arrow Video. Yes, Im still singing their praises. The quality of the picture here is fantastic with a gorgeous transfer. The extras are very numerous and include a brand new audio commentary track with horror journalist Justin Beahm and CHILDREN OF THE CORN historian John Sullivan, an audio commentary track with director Fritz Kiersch, producer Terrence Kirby and actors Franklin and Gaines, HARVESTING HORROR: THE MAKING OF CHILDREN OF THE CORN a retrospective piece on the film full of interviews, AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD THEM  a brand new interview with actors Julie Maddalena and John Philbin, IT WAS THE EIGHTIES! an interview with Linda Hamilton, FIELED OF NIGHTMARES a brand new interview with writer George Goldsmith, RETURN TO GATLIN a brand new featurette revisiting the films original Iowa locations, STEPHEN KING ON A SHOESTRING an interview with producer Donald Borchers, WELCOME TO GATLIN: THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF CHILDREN OF THE CORN an interview with production designer Craig Stearns and composer Jonathan Elias, CUT FROM THE CORNFIELD an interview with actor Rich Kleinberg on the infamous lost Blue Man scene, DISCIPLES OF THE CROW a 1983 short film adaptation of the original King story, a storyboard gallery, the original trailer and a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork. With all of these extras you can see why if you're a fan of the film you need to pick up this version for your shelf.",1506988800,,4408,4.537106918238994
500174,1,6302720419,Ive ordered the 1984 version twice now and both times Amazon has sent me the crappy 2009 remake. Dont know where you can buy the original but it sure isn't from Amazon. The 1984 movie is my favorite Halloween movie of all time so thanks Amazon.,1506643200,,244,4.326086956521739
500175,3,6302720419,"Children of the Corn (1984) is not a good film.  Even Stephen King was smart enough to keep the original down to a short story...and this from a guy who regularly puts out novels you can use as a coffee table!  But there's something about the idea that's hard to resist: a small Midwest corn town overrun by killer kids who've murdered their parents and worship an unseen entity called ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows.""  As written, there's a Twilight Zone episode worth of material at best.  But that didn't stop producers from expanding the characters and mythology to accommodate six sequels, some of which are actually superior to the original now out in a Blu-ray special edition courtesy of Arrow Video.

Burt and Vicky (played by a pre-Thirtysomething Peter Horton and pre-Terminator Linda Hamilton) are traveling cross-country for Burt's new med school internship when they run into trouble - literally - in the town of Gatlin, Nebraska.  After accidently hitting a young child with their car, the pair begins to suspect a different cause of death.  The only adult in town is a skittish mechanic (R.G. Armstrong) who recommends they change direction immediately, but Gatlin draws them in, empty streets and crumbling buildings welcoming them in sinister fashion.

But Gatlin is far from empty.  It's lorded over by Isaac (John Franklin) and Malachai (Courtney Gains), the charismatic bookends of a dangerous corn-worshipping cult who led a violent revolt that left every adult dead.  Luckily, Burt and Vicky run across a pair of cuties too young to be brainwashed who help them navigate the juvenile politics and find a way to escape.  But an even bigger threat is lurking in the fields, buried under the ground and demanding a human sacrifice.

One of the first releases put out by New World Pictures after it was purchased from Roger Corman, Children of the Corn's success has everything to do with timing.  Part of a wave of '80s Stephen King adaptations (Cujo, Firestarter, The Dead Zone), pay cable and home video created a new demand for brand-name horror that director Fritz Kiersch's film fit perfectly.  By genre standards there is very little blood, no nudity and only one well-earned jump scare.  Yet the movie (and it's simple but effective poster art) continues to intrigue new audiences who probably admire it's potential more than anything else.

Although King took a shot at the script himself, his attempt was scrapped in favor of a tepid screenplay that desperately tries to stretch itself the full 90 minutes.  The opening narration (by a character not included in the original story) allows us to see the Gatlin massacre as it happened, ruining some of the mystery right off the top.  Even with all the stabbings and crucifixions, Children of the Corn looks and feels more like a TV adaptation than a feature film.  The only thing keeping it afloat is its creepy premise and committed performances from Horton, Hamilton and Courtney Gains, whose greasy red hair and suspenders inspired an entire South Park ripoff (""OUTLANDER!"").

The extras on Arrow Video's Blu-ray, however, makes this a must-purchase title even if you're only a fair-weather fan of the film itself.  The brand new 2K restoration does wonders with the '80 cinematography, easily topping any previous release.  And there's a whole crop of special features, old and new, starting with a short film adaptation - Disciples of the Crow - shot in 1983 that has all the rough, shot-on-16mm appeal the main feature lacks.  Other new material includes an audio commentary with Justin Beahm and John Sullivan, interviews with actors Julie Maddalena and John Philbin, writer George Goldsmith and producer Donald P. Borchers.  Recycled stuff really piles it on with another commentary (this time from the filmmaking team), the Harvesting Horror retrospective documentary, an interview with Linda Hamilton, a look back at the shooting locations, backstory on a deleted scene, storyboards, trailers and an illustrated collector's booklet.",1506556800,2,4019,5.072948328267477

The movie itself is not a spectacular movie by any means, the reason I bought it is, my son  was selected as an extra, ""one of the boys"". It was filmed in our area in 2009. He has quite a few scenes, although not speaking parts, close up and action shots. He took the copy we had when he left for the military.

The film moves along at a painfully sluggish pace, with some strange narrative choices but the stand out experience is from creepy child preacher Isaac Chroner, played to perfection by a 23 year old John Franklin. Overall, an average 80s horror film.

500240,2,6302720419,"This movie is a far cry from the original. The only thing that is note worthy is David Anders performance.  His wife was so annoying I wanted to reach through the t.v. and punch her in the face.  I cheered when she died.  The child who played Issac was just horrible.  He was a terrible actor who not only was incapable of being intense or menacing, but he seemed to be reading script cards the whole time.  If you are a David Anders fan and can find the strength to soldier through, his performance is worth it.",1481241600,,512,4.237113402061856

500262,3,6302720419,"The movie is based loosely on the original with several differences as expected. It doesn't feel as sinister or scary as the original but that could be due to the fact that in the modern world, most horror elements are easily eliminated from being real life possibilities. We also used to use the dark as a source of horror. Newer movies seem to have gotten away from that.

Either way, this movie is a great as a standalone title and makes for a decent remake. It's definitely worth watching at least once. If nothing else, it's better than every single sequel that came from the original.",1481241600,4,590,4.566037735849057

500265,2,6302720419,"Was told that the soundtrack was by Terence Trent D'Arby, but this turned out to be untrue. The soundtrack was run of the mill horror stuff: Stabby strings, choirs, that sort of thing. Not really my cup of tea as I was hoping for something a little more soulful. Not terrible, but not pre-Hardline 1980's crooning either.

500282,2,6302720419,"A young couple (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) find themselves in the seemingly abandoned town of Gatlin, where a cult of children have killed all the adults and worship something that lives in the cornfields.

This film has its moments if you can put your brain on hold from beginning to end.  The protagonists have to make every stereotypical horror movie dumb choice in order to put themselves into danger.  It was hard to figure out if the creature was something that crawled around under the ground or a cloud of bad 80s special effects that blew through the air.  The prologue that set up the events of the film was effective and gave me hope that it might live up to the classic status that some have given it.

The Sequels of Stephen King

by

M. M.

  Stephen King has written many sequels.  Big Wheels: a Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman # 2), The Way Station, The Slow Mutants, The Gunslinger and the Dark Man, The Dark Tower II: the Drawing of the Three, The Dark Tower III: the Wastelands and Wizard and Glass to name a few.  There are also The Regulators and Desperation.  There is also, what I like to call the Castle Rock stories.
  Nona, Cujo, The Sun Dog, The Body, The Dark Half, Sleepwalkers, Needful Things and It Grows on You.  The Breathing Method is a sequel to The Man who Would Not Shake Hands.  Stephen King once wrote a sequel to the Cthulhu mythos.  One for the Road is a sequel to Salems Lot.
  Nevertheless, Stephen King didn't write all of his own sequels.  In 92, they wrote Pet Sematary Two.  Then they made Children of the Corn II: the Final Sacrifice.  Then there came Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest.
  Then there came Sometimes They Come Back Again.  Then there was Children of the Corn IV: the Gathering.  Then there is The Rage: Carrie 2.  Finally, there is Children of the Corn V: Field of Terror, Children of the Corn 666 and Children of the Corn (2009) the remake maybe don't you think?  Yes; course there is!!

When the corn kids finally kill her, I'm relieved. At this point, I realize this is the 2009 remake of the original Children of the Corn.  I barely remember the original but know enough that I can't imagine anyone with ambition running through their veins would want to retool the original.  Isaac, the leader is cute as a button and just can't be taken seriously. Malachi is running around bloody the entire length of the film from beginning to end. Some of the corn kids look like they use the exercise. Poor Burt, who ignored his wife's pleas for help (and who can blame him) is hiding in the cornfields bleeding from a knife wound and having flashbacks he's back in Vietnam..wait...what?)

500489,3,6302720419,"Having reread some of King's work recently, I was both looking forward to watching this film with the pleasant hope of having a ""new"" Horror movie to add to my collection as I did with ""1408""; and dreading the idea of finding more of that ""The Mist"" nonsense going on.  Watching adaptations of Stephen King's work has always held a weird fascination over me in that while I'm perfectly aware that the such movies sometimes (frequently!) don't work out, I can't quite shake the desire to find successes.  So, with that being said, the obvious question is, ""was this movie a success in any sense?""; to which I can only answer, ""meh.""
  The first observation to make about ""Children of the Corn"" (CotC) is that it deviates immediately from the original short story.  Typically, when adapting the work of Stephen King to the silver screen, this is a really good move - King does like to wallow in character development and to indulge in differing perspectives - but here it actually takes something away from the story.  The basic premise is still the same: a couple is traveling through the Bible Belt, and come across a murderous cult of demon-worshiping children who have taken over a small rural town.  But the choice to abandon the short story's approach to introducing both characters and the concept immediately lessen the impact of CotC.  The fact of the matter here is that Fritz Kiersch makes a bee-line for what always kills a Horror Movie's mood: exhibition.  King understands (in short stories, anyway) that the less you're allowed to know, the more sinister a creepy situation becomes; and because Kiersch chooses to show us how the town becomes over-run with Reagan-wannabes (that would be Reagan from ""The Exorcist"", not Ronald), we may as well skip the pretense of Horror and settle in for watching a thriller.
  Mind you, once you've reconciled yourself to the lack of true Horror, CotC isn't an un-watchable film.  It still has its moments and, truth be told, a great many of the child actors do a very good job of acting like possessed little monsters - it is, after all, natural to them.  And throughout the whole movie, it's very easy to catch yourself thinking that the right combination of desperation, need, and fanaticism could very well lead to such a thing really happening. (Well, apart from the demon, maybe.)  But is CotC a good movie?  In a word, in case you didn't notice my rating, ""no"".  The fact that CotC is meant to be Horror really hangs over the affair, killing the mood, in much the same way that BO puts paid to a romantic dinner-date.  And the simple truth is this movie has some of the worst special effects I've ever seen; so even if I'd been able to enjoy the idea of watching a fairly competent thriller, I would have been constantly jarred by the realization that my dogs could have put together a better SFX presentation.
  On the whole, while I wouldn't say it's a ""bad"" movie, I can't recommend CotC to anyone - even to die-hard Stephen King fans.  If you're looking to scratch that particular itch, I would suggest you watch ""Christine"" or ""Rose Red"".",1406678400,2,3099,4.682656826568266

500492,2,6302720419,not nearly as good as the original film or its man sequels. nice try at doing something different though. try again,1403740800,,115,4.523809523809524
500493,1,6302720419,"I will give the filmmakers credit in that they did try to stick a bit more closely to King's original short story...but that's a problem. It's a short story, under 20 pages in length, and they have to make a 90 minute film, so you know this thing will be padded to the gills.

Right off the bat we see the kids of Gatlin, Nebraska in a tent revival being preached to by a very timid looking Isaac in 1963? I know I'm in trouble now..Isaac should be all ""hellfire"" & ""damnation"", and while this little actor may be saying the right things...he's too adorable. It's like listening to Cindy Brady read the lyrics to a death metal song, it just doesn't work.

Flash forward to the mid-70's (of course, no one talks or looks like someone from the mid-70's), we meet a bickering couple on the backroads of Nebraska as they argue along a road passing a huge cornfield. The couple argues, and kid with a cut throat comes stumbling out of the corn, and as the couple argues, they hit the dying kid with their car. Getting of the car arguing, the couple walk over and argue over the corpse. While arguing about what to do next, they argue some more. Arguing, the couple put the dead body in the back of the car and decide to argue their way into Gatlin to find help, while arguing. Arguing, they arrive in Gatlin, and they argue getting out of the car, and argue themselves into a deserted diner where they argue. Finally they separate to look for help, and still manage to argue, even when they are not together. Pretty soon the kids show to murder these two...and thank god, I'm actually rooting for them to succeed just so the arguing will stop.

Now we get a prolonged chase through the corn. Lots of running and ducking in the corn, so much running and ducking that our hero flashes back to Vietnam. The kids chase the guy through the corn, and they even have a flashback montage of all of the events from the opening of the movie...and we see some more arguing. They are still running through corn.

This movie is just awful. I enjoyed the original Linda Hamilton, 80's slasher version of this tale, but this was a complete waste of time. Honestly, the first hour of this film is spent with this grating couple driving around arguing, and that is not an exaggeration. I'm not quite sure what they were going for, as you honestly begin to loathe these people, and hope to see them die just to shut them up! The casting is just so bad, with only the kid playing Malachai being somewhat decent, the rest of the kids are just awful. Toss in a bizarre and rather explicit sex scene, and the desperation by the filmmakers to shock just oozes out of the DVD player.

Nothing to recommend, and I can see why King refused to have anything to do with movie.",1403222400,4,2743,4.381139489194499

500495,3,6302720419,"What if there were no adults around and the town was run by demented children?  This movie speculates on this idea.  While the movie is very scary, much of it makes no sense if you think it out too deeply - things like: How are these kids responsible enough to keep the yards in this town all mowed?  Who planted the corn that year and did they use a tractor?  If there was so little fuel and none of the children seemed to drive, how did they transfer food to the area?  If nobody had income, what food were they living on during the winter months when they couldn't grow their own corn?  The movie certainly contained some creepy-looking children.  That short kid that looked like a high-voiced man and spoke so well was spooky. (I wouldn't want to be his mother -well of course, because the children murdered all the adults.)  That Mick Jagger lipped red-headed boy screamed ""Outlander"" just a few too many times for my liking.  Hey, watch the show though, it will really start you to thinking.",1401840000,2,997,4.464088397790055
500496,4,6302720419,"I never realized how many ""Children of the Corn"" movies there are?!? I think they are up to 9 in total!! That is crazy...I think King's original short story was around 20 pages.

Of course, as a lover of Bad Movies, I can't wait to watch them all.

With that said, I remember this first entry very well. I actually saw this one in theaters when I was about the same age as Malachi, and remember really enjoying it. I've seen it a few times of the years, but it has been at least two decades since my last visit to Gatlin, Nebraska and thought it was time to give it another view...along with the sequels.

As the film begins we see events unfold in Gatlin, Nebraska, a small farming community suffering from drought. In the opening moments of the film, thanks to narrator Job, we learn that most of the kids have fallen under the spell of Isaac, a new kid in town who happens to be a preacher. One Sunday after church, all of the kids in Gatlin begin murdering all of the adults in town. Job sees his father cut down in front of him, and only Job and his sister Sarah have not fallen under Isaac's spell.

Flash forward 3 years and we meet, Burt and Vicky, a young couple traveling to Seattle where Burt has taken a job as an ER doctor. And of course they decide to get off the highway and end up traveling through the 2-lane countryside heading towards Gatlin. While looking at a map, they run over a young boy who was trying to escape Gatlin and it's cult. When Burt examines the boy's body he notices his throat is cut, and that he was already dying when he was struck by the car. Looking to report the crime, the young couple drive through the corn and into Gatlin where they'll meet the Children of the Corn.

I was surprised at how well this film holds up!! The F/X are still pretty solid (well the climax is bit cartoony..but still good), and the acting is really good for a B-Movie. Specifically the kids who play Isaac, Malachi and Job. Malachi in particular has a real menace that comes across on screen, and Isaac just out and out creepy. Linda Hamilton is always fun to watch as the damsel in distress.

I highly recommend this first entry...now bring on the sequels!",1401408000,2,2179,4.315403422982885

Later here in my adult life I've watched it again, and here's my take on the movie... good, bad, or indifferent. Stephan King's short story of this title in Night Shift was and still is in my opinion a good look at what a cult structure can spawn, and who better to manipulate that children; young people who never experienced the outside world, shielded from it by the small town stigma to the fullest. Along comes a supernatural entity that provokes, manipulates, and in the end controls the minds of the young. of a small town in Nebraska. Obviously the town itself (Gatlin) is fictional, but the manipulation of children through a religious cult is not fictional.... it happens every day. Off topic.... okay, this movie as far as the time period in when it was made was wonderfully done in my opinion. The horrible demise of the couple in the book does not happen in the movie, along with other Hollywood interferences in the story. Still, this movie is a five star rating in my opinion, due to the creepy soundtrack, the claustrophobia of a small town (done very well), and the fact that children were used as the catalyst for the demon to take over the entire town, and when you really think about it, I would use this movie as a reminder of what could happen when cults take over the minds of young people who have no sense of right and wrong outside of their little guidelines layed upon them by ""He who Walks Behind the Rows"", fanatics, or anything that deals in absolutes in an ever changing world and society.....

500561,5,6302720419,"I have read many other reviews on here about the distasteful elements of the movie, but isn't that the point of going to the movies to begin with? In this genre of movies especially, shock value is what makes a movie the critics either have a love for,or an absolute sheer hatred for. Yes... it is true there are a few moments in the movie that left me feeling uneasy... but when you really think about the context of what Stephan King had written in his short story, that was the point; NOT TO FOLLOW BLINDLY IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OTHERS. As we all know children are the most easily swayed in politics, religion, what have you. Obviously I don't know what was going on in Kings head when he wrote the short story, but if I had to guess, I would conclude that children are probably the most savage creatures out there. When you think about it, Children of the Corn taps into that essence of following the crowd, and what can happen when lynching becomes a lifestyle. Follow what's popular, or we'll lynch you, pick on you, torture you, heck we might even kill you, right? A child's moral status isn't fully established, depending on the environment and so forth. This story kind of reminds me of a ""Lor,d of the Flies"" om age.",1393286400,4,1224,4.420353982300885

I am a long time Stephen King fan, been there since the beginning days of his first published short stories. As far as an adaptation goes this falls well short of the original source material. I am also a fan of movies in general, and  understand the need to condense material for the same of time constraints.
This film fails at even those most basic levels, and that suspension of dissbeleif is shattered with choppy editing and basic understanding of the main characters motivations.
Why does  the female lead character even stays with her jerk boyfriend throughout the entire ordeal ?  I would have ditched his ass for the Demon in the corn to devour, got a decent hair style, and continued the journey alone.
This movie is a great example of how King's material does not translate into teleplay that easily, and I am glad to see that recent efforts with his stories have been more successful.",1391731200,,1051,4.579787234042553

(they were 8 and 10, if that, at the time :) )  I TOLD them not to mess with my movies - bad thing to say although if I'da said go ahead and watch them if you want, they'da still watched 'em anyway so it didn't matter.  But the fact that my 32 and 30yo sons can't put on their big boy pants and watch the movie without it freaking them out makes it worth the 5 stars for me!  I love it!  That'll teach 'em not to listen to their mom when she says leave it alone.  Dad doesn't like these types of movies so it doesn't matter to him.

So if my little story doesn't help you decide to watch the video, that's fine.  But I still give it the 5 stars even though I feel it's only worth 3 for the actual watchability of it.

500672,3,6302720419,"This movie, based on the short story of the same name in Stephen King's night shift collection, takes on an interesting, creepy, original idea and squashes it like a mushy corn cake.

 The film begins with promise, little evil kids peeking into the windows of a diner as other sadistic brats slaughter the adults inside. So yeah, the movie starts out with a bang but runs out of fuel way too fast. The main stars Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton and pre-Terminator Linda Hamilton) are the focal point while they're finding dead kids, weird distorted bibles, church meetings and parting corn fields. They are interesting enough characters but can't save this film from becoming just another video lining the store shelves.

 A main issue is some of the annoying child actors. Malachai (Courtney Gains) acts well but has one of the biggest mouths I have ever seen (literally). You should see the size of this thing we he opens it wide and really goes to town with his Shakespearean speaking. And all of the combined dialogue of he and his partner in crime, John Franklin (Isaac), is atrocious. Two unforgivable sins: boring pace and too much chitchat the audience couldn't care less about.

 Some of the slayings are cool enough but seem almost an afterthought to the constant preaching. Toss this up with a silly finale and it wraps up to be field fertilizer. I always love weird cult premises, they can be dark and morbid, but this one has the kids too melodramatic and doesn't delve deep enough into the story itself.

 Another bad idea the creator's had was how the ended was executed. The story by itself before they started showing cheap effects in a cheesy wrap-up was slightly chilling simply because it could really happen. For the most part of the movie I saw the other children as brainwashed by two crazed older leaders. But the films ending blows any creepiness all to hell and takes on the job in the most laughable way possible. Rolling earth?? Brrrr....

 Despite all these faults and being boring for the most part, the movie has some decent parts and is worth watching at least once for curiosity's sake. It's not horrible, it's not great, but it's there...just another video lining the store shelves.",1379635200,,2213,4.754569190600522

Now, it may sound ""Lord of the Flies"", but it's kind of not. There is killing in the movie, but nothing gorey or graphic.

500737,1,6302720419,"This is the first film I've ever given a one-star rating on here. I always try to find some good in a movie, some redeeming quality that makes me like it, but it felt like no matter what happened in this movie, it just made me angrier and more bored.

Let me break it down for you like this: Burt and Vicky, in this film, are a married couple on the brink of utter marital destruction; the character Vicky is the most insufferable shrew one could imagine. Whereas Linda Hamilton's character in the 1984 original was playful, friendly and much more easily able to relate to, this Vicky spends the first 40-45 minutes doing nothing but yelling at her husband, blaming him and insulting him when he didn't even cause a need for her to be upset. Burt is honestly the only character I can relate to in the movie; he's good-natured, patient, strong-willed and is still able to emote like a regular human being (as opposed to his wife who basically does nothing but spew animosity throughout). This isn't a Children of the Corn remake!!! This is ""How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days: Hee-Haw Edition""!!!

The evil children in this movie are also very poorly done, especially in comparison to those of the original. The kids in this film aren't very bright and don't do a half-convincing job that they're evil; honestly I just felt like the little suckers needed a good spanking to set them straight. Also, I'm aware that one isn't supposed to like the villain in a horror film, but even as the bad guys, I just wanted to go up to the children and say ""I don't like you."" That's right, even the villains in this horror film aren't on par with a decently-done villain role. The character of Isaac was just an annoying little shrimp, whereas in the original he was twisted and menacing, and FAR more believable. This film's Malachai also has nowhere near as much finesse as Courtney Gains in the original movie; Malachai here just kinda has no personality and is pretty forgettable as far as being the bad guy that does the dirty work.

What really bothers me about the film, though, is that despite how insufferable the first 45 minutes or so were, halfway through, this movie has the utter nerve to pick up the pace. I wasn't expecting the film to be very exciting, but about 50 minutes in the kids start to attack, Burt fights back in an attempt to rescue Vicky, and all the creepy cult material kicks into play. It's bad enough that half the film wastes our time on pointless bickering, but to turn itself into an almost-decent excuse for a low-budget made-for-television remake of a horror classic just bothered me. It's the equivalence of hearing a musical artist you don't like do a legitimately good cover of a song you do like.

All in all, this was one of the poorest horror movie remakes I've ever seen. The ONLY reason I would suggest that anyone watch it is they, like me, want to complete the Children of the Corn film series. Otherwise, stay FAR away from this garbage. This is just one of those films that shouldn't have been made. In all honesty though, I do think there are some remakes of the 2000's that are legitimately good, such as The Last House on the Left, Maniac and Mother's Day, so give those films a chance before you subject yourself to the torture that is this movie.

We aren't given any background information, characters are missing, and Isaac is so little and cute, that he isn't believable.

500822,4,6302720419,"Children of the Corn is a 1984 horror movie based on a Stephen King story of the same name. In the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, life is going on as normal one Sunday morning. The adults in town have just gotten out of church while all but two children are in the local cornfields with a mysterious boy named Isaac, whom the one kid's father doesn't like or trust.

After services end, the children with Isaac begin their attacks and suddenly murder every one of the adults in the town. Three years later, Isaac and the town's kids have continued living their isolated existence when a dating couple, played by Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton, stumble (or should I say 'drive') across a teenager who, like the other two kids not in the field that day, knew the evils in Gatlin had tried escaping but was caught and murdered.

This leads the couple into town where the kids under Isaac's leadership decide to bring them and sacrifice them to their god, known only as He Who Walks Behind The Rows. The couple must now protect the two kids on their side as well as bring an end to the murdering child cult.

CotC is what I think to be one of the better made Stephen King adaptions. The movie is an entertaining horror movie in its own right as well. As for the actual blu-ray itself, I have no complaints there. It looks nice enough. So far I've only used one of the special features, the function where trivia pops up on screen and every once in a while. It does give some nice background on different scenes.

I know people on both sides of the fence on this subject and have listened to them all on their thoughts. Me myself I fall somewhere in the middle since I do like the movie but admit that it is not as great as some say. In fact if you want a good one check out the first filming of this story on ""Stephen King's Nightshift Collection"" movie called ""Disciples of the Crow"". It is a better telling of the story and like the story is a short film.

Based on King's short story the film follows a couple traveling the country that happen to have an accident near the town of Gatlin Nebraska. This town though is not as it seems when the couple arrive, the town has a secret that may be the end of them both. An entity known only as ""He who walks behind the rows"" has taken control of the town's children and has them following his religion. And with that control he has them kill off all adults in brutal fashion.

Now it seems that those who believe that this is a classic believe so for one of a couple of reasons I think, could be wrong, have been before. Any way I think a lot of people put this as classic status because it is a King movie, and one from the 80's none the less. Now that can be easily disputed because is that really a reason to label something classic? Then of course there are those who consider it a classic because they watched it when they were young. Now for those who say that I will not debate you at all because I am guilty of that with some titles as well, so I can see that. You are not looking at it as another movie that you would judge more realistically today because it holds a special place in your heart. I am down with that because I do the same thing with movies I watched as a kid.

Now on to those who hate this movie all I can say is most I have talked to did not have actual reasons for disliking it other than so many call it a classic because it is a King flick from the 80's. Now I am not talking about everybody because there are people who have actual reasons for disliking it like there are those with actual reasons to like it. Any way as for my opinion I have to say I actually like this movie, not love although there are things I love in it.

Now at full length it was always going to hard to make the short story stay interesting. Don't get me wrong I think there maybe someone out there who can make the right film for this, someday maybe. In order for this to work as a full length film it would have to have suspense like crazy and atmosphere throughout the entire film. I feel like if this story could be done like the old school horror films it would be a huge success. But any way I have to say I loved the actual short story and like the movie. It has flaws of course but the idea always was interesting to me. Plus I always loved the ""He who walks behind the rows"" line, super cool line in my opinion. Then of course I thought John Franklin was creepy as child preacher Isaac, but it was Courtney Gains who stole the show. I always liked his portrayal of Malachai and the scene where he is yelling ""Outlander"" was great.

Now of course the film has its flaws such as the pacing, the movie tends to move slowly at times. That seems to be the films biggest problem I think and some of the acting is not up to par. Also time has not helped that ending and its special effects which is not the movies fault I must point out but it is there. I believe director Fritz Kiersch did what he could with the adaptation since at full length it is not horrible.

I have to say that no matter how I feel about the flick the DVD is great with behind the scenes stuff and an excellent commentary. This is one of those commentaries in which they actually give some good behind the scenes stuff up and tell some funny stories from the set. Like the kid in the road thing with the accident at the beginning. Any way I would say if you are interested in King's films then pick up the special addition here for the special features.",1352678400,2,4115,4.08539603960396

Pretty faithful adaptation of Stephen King's story, although the husband and wife are more appealing in the film than in the story!  I live in the midwest and dig this story about a cult of kids who kill all the adults and take over!  Very spooky and cool!",1343692800,,314,4.379310344827586
500878,4,6302720419,"I enjoyed Children of the Corn. It's an original horror movie that packs in tension, thrills and some supernatural aspects. The whole cornfield setting was claustrophobic and interesting. The music was also great. Some decent acting, but also some bad acting. The children did a decent job and got the job done, but some of it was bad. I did enjoy John Franklin's performance as Isaac, though. All of the Outlander shouting was a bit cheesy, on the other hand.

Overall, if you're looking for an authentic, old-school horror film, I recommend Children of the Corn. (the original, not the remake). As of 7/31/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.

This film has violence and blood (some of it is done off-screen), no sex or nudity.",1343692800,,741,4.826771653543307

I first assumed it would scarier than it was. A good movie, but a little streiotypical. It depicted farm kids and town people to be all farmers and unintelligent. They all have biblical names and simple ways of living. The children weren't as frightning as they should have been to victomize adults. And the concept is a little corny (yes, pun intended) with the monster we never actually see as well as killer corn is really just humourus to me.

But other wise a good watch, something that can be enjoyed from time to time. But still, definitley not a fav.",1340236800,,682,4.27906976744186

500881,2,6302720419,"I hate being missed in my review, but contrary to what some other people say, this version of Children of the Corn is actually better than the 1984 original.  David Anders is more interesting than the character Peter Horton played in the original -- this time, we get a former Marine from Vietnam instead of the just-graduated emergency room doctor.  The woman who plays Vicky in this movie, instead of Linda Hamilton, is also great.  These two fight constantly and are on the verge of a divorce, which is more interesting than the lovely dovey couple that Horton and Hamilton played back in 1984.

But, they are the only two who are better actors than in the original. The child actors in this are awful, especially the one playing Isaac.  He is so bad that at times I felt like I was watching a grade school parents' night play.  Just awful.

I also miss the two good kids from the original -- Job and Sarah.  Without them, the town's just full of evil, crazy kids and the movie's less interesting.

I also miss the weird old guy who ran the filling station in the original movie...he was not in this one.

I read the original Stephen King short story and this adaptation does better reflect the plot of that story...but it's missing the best parts of the 1984 movie.

I actually started this review giving the movie a 3...but as I wrote this, I have been thinking on that and realize it's at best a 2-star in terms of ratings.

A movie like this is really a success based on who plays the Isaac character...the leader of the kids.  The first movie worked because the kid cast as Isaac was the right blend of menacing and creepy.  The one in this new version failed because its Isaac was just a terrible actor.  I swear, he must have been the producer's nephew or something because I can't imagine they auditioned more than one kid and decided HE was the best one.",1338249600,,1866,4.447058823529412
500882,2,6302720419,"Well, I don't normally want to see Stephen King stories, because they've been getting gorier as they go along. But I had read this one (originally a short story), and I had seen clips, and I figured being so old, it wouldn't be as disgusting as the later films. Yeah, OK, sort of.

In a small town in Nebraska, one day three years ago (says the film), all those under 19 rose up and slaughtered all the adults. They are led by a religious fanatic who had been a child preacher before he came to the town, and knew how to manipulate the children to do his bidding. Just goes to show you people should not use kids for preachers. But anyway.

Cut to a handsome young couple (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) who are passing through on their way to a vacation in Seattle. They were driving down a back road near the cursed town when a boy ran out in front of their car. They couldn't avoid hitting him, but it turns out his throat had been cut back in the corn field, where the couple found his suitcase covered in blood. They put the body in the trunk of the car and take the suitcase with them and drive off to find someone to report the murder to.

An old guy working on a truck at a gas station that has no gas directs them to a town 19 miles away, and warns them against the nearby town, which is full of religious fanatics who don't like strangers. He's wrong about that. They want the strangers: they need them to sacrifice to He Who Walks Behind (between?) the Rows.

I think I'd have liked this better if it turned out to just be psychosis and manipulation on the part of Isaac, the young preacher, and Malachi, his bloodthirsty henchmen. But there's a supernatural element involved in the nature of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Exactly who or what he is never becomes clear.

Still, I guess it's worth watching. If you generally like horror movies, and specifically like Stephen King, it's probably just the sort of thing you like.",1336780800,2,1939,4.330578512396694

I usually want to like the protagonists of the movies/books that I see/read.  I didn't like the two main characters from the beginning.  From her bitching and moaning, to his hitting her and ignoring her wishes, I really didn't care what happened to them.

I laughed out loud during the main chase... One of the kids actually had a leaf rake as his weapon.  The 4 year old getting all worked up at the ""fertilization scene"" was a bit strange, then the Vietnam flashbacks, and the Wizard of Oz-like attacking vines did it in.

500908,1,6302720419,"I'm watching this movie right now, and it is so bad I have to write a commentary.

I liked the original version.

This one is atrocious.

It is the mid 70's and an interracial couple is driving through Nebraska.  Unlikely, yes, and even more unlikely is that the woman is the black one.

The woman is loud, mean, and constantly complaining.  Constantly.  The man seems cool headed and has recently returned from a tour in 'Nam.  I hope the woman gets killed but I doubt it.  She really needs to die.  I'm surprised the husband hasn't done it already.  Seriously, she's taking jabs at him about Vietnam, calling him a rapist and child killer and stuff.  Not cool.  Why hasn't he smacked the face off her?  She is begging for it.  C'mon.  Domestic violence laws weren't as crippling back then.

The first 35 minutes of this movie was them fighting in the car.  It was just as annoying as watching a couple fight in real life.

Oh my god I just saw the man just do a Steven Segal move where he broke a kid's arm bones out.  Oh he just killed a kid.  I guess his frantic wife was right haha.

I'm not sure what the point of this movie is, or what the ""moral"" is supposed to be.  Religion is bad?  I'll go with that... as long as we include KING's religion.

The new Issac is weak.  I can barely understand him.  He mumbles and is too quiet.  And why does Malaci always have blood all over him?  Shouldn't he wash his hands?  I would.  I hate sticky hands!

Why can't they just re-do movies with better film and effects?  It always seems like the acting is WORSE.  And the directors always want to change the story to ""make it their own"".  Get a life.

The man is having Vietnam flashbacks in the corn field now.  He just killed 2 kids.  More flashbacks.  Lots of blonde kids here.  Naturally they are evil.  Nothing more evil than blonde people and Nazis.  Remember WW2?  This movie is really bad.  He just stabbed a 5 year old blonde kid in the juggler.

Dinner time at the kid's camp.  Fat girl just slapped someone's hand who was trying to take her plate of corn.  Funny.  Oh now here's the ""Time of Fertilization"" aka the underage sex scene.  This is inappropriate and just creepy.  What kind of sick director would insist on showing this?  Little kids are watching them do it and are cheering them on.  Wow that was so very wrong.  Glad my daughter wasn't watching this movie with me.  Instead of Fertilization Time, maybe a funeral would be more appropriate?  I mean, 5 or so kids died today.

Are these kids Amish?  Only Amish kids dress like that, from what I've seen.  And I grew up in Iowa.

Wow they really did kill the wife.  Good.  I expect the guy will die too now.  So now I don't really care about anyone in this movie.  Oh the guy just died.  The end.

I've usually found most of them to be more funny that scary...
But there have been 5 or 6 movies in this genre which produced
the desired effect on me, and scared the crap out of me!---Or at least gave a few chills.

1984's ""The Children Of The Corn"" is just such a movie...
I was 20 years old when this film was released.
I swear!!--That creepy little kid with the deep eyes, the black amish get-up and the pork-pie hat
named Issac...OMG!! )-:
He came into that little sleepy rural midwestern town and upset the balance of nature!
The ominous demonic entity, referred to as ""HE WHO WALKS BEHIND THE ROWS"".....OOOOH SPOOKY!!
Though you don't actually get to see it...just more of a demonic rumbling, growling, plowing-up-the-
soil-kinda-thing-a'la-TREMORS that cuts through the corn field, and near that victorian-style farmhouse
that everybody SANE or SEMI-SANE is hold up in! (-:

Btw, my screen name was partly inspired by this 27 year old horror film by the master...Stephen King;
which speaks volumes, I guess, for the subliminal impact that it had on my young psyche back then.

But the most terrifying character to me...even moreso, or just as much as Issac, was that big,
tall, gangly, goofy, in-bred-looking ginger named Malachai, who was quite handy with a machete
or a butcher knife!---Who could forget that opening scene with him chasing the little kids through
the corn field and up onto the highway!---YIKES!!

Though this movie began with only a cult following, it has since spawned a slew of re-makes and sequels.
I was hoping that they would release a remastered / restored 2-disc deluxe DVD version of this,
replete with rare outtakes & extras, especially since it has been released to Blu-Ray already...
But so far, no such animal.
What is surprising to me, is how many people I've met who are professed Stephen King fans,
but don't know about, and have never seen nor heard of this version before!
I just think W O W!!--Really?
""The Children Of The Corn"" is a classic horror film, which has lasted the decades now, and proven all of
its initial detractors WRONG!!---So there!
Check it out...if you haven't already.

**Oh yeah, actress Linda Hamilton, who is better known for another blockbuster
movie franchise in which she starred in the same year that she played in this film, plays the heroine.
I'm 47 years old now, and I still can't watch this on a dark and somber night without checking all
my door & window locks!---SHHHHH!!--(Whispers) Don't tell anybody! (-:",1314316800,2,2541,4.805491990846682
500914,2,6302720419,"The film itself was directed by Donald P. Borchers who also ended up taking Stephen King's original short story to adapt into the screenplay that produced this wreck of a film. Children of the Corn is Borcher's third time behind the director's chair but from his first time having worked with horror as he has worked as both crew and producer on a large amount of horror films in the past including a few movies you may have heard of (and loved or hated) such as Leprechaun 2, Highlander 2, The Fog, and a personal favorite of mine - The Howling. Did I mention he was also one of the producers on the original 1984 release?

The 2009 release of the classic Stephen King's Children of the Corn should have taken a few queues of the 1984 release that had come before it. This movie trumps almost every other re-make that had come out in 2009 in teaching the lesson of what not to do while re-making a classic horror film. I'm actually shocked it came out as bad as it did with how easy of a concept the film actually has but it seemed that everything they could do to make it wrong was what they went with for the story. With Borchers past experience in the horror genre I really have to question how this film turned out as it did. Even the actors felt underused as the film went out.

We open the film with Burton Stanton (an actor you will easily recognize from a slew of television shows) and his wife Vicki (Kandyse McClure of Battlestar Galactica fame) are driving across country and it's this initial scene that blows the movie as Vicki is really just more cruel than necessary and doesn't seem to play the part right. The problem is after Battlestar you know Kandyse has the acting chops she just doesn't seem to come off as believable hateful as she is supposed to be in this film. When the couple finally hit a child in the car and have to find a town they come across a nearly deserted city and find it full of only children with Issac (Preston Bailey who ends up playing Cody on Dexter and Nicholas in the 2010 remake of The Crazies) in charge.

For those that don't know the basis of the plot, the children have taken over the city killing all of the adults and using them as sacrifices to a creature that lives in the cornfield whom they worship as a God. The big bonus of being able to see what is ruling these children's lives never happens as there is no payoff that shows what it is and the ending felt both rushed and unnatural with how Burton falls into having flashbacks that overlay the horror he is experiencing.

ScyFy has put together some impressive re-makes in the past. Their production value on the Dune (yes I know not horror) miniseries comes to mind. However I will quickly admit that all I am doing right now is looking forward to the Dimension Films re-make that will be coming out in the near future to wipe this abomination out of my memory. With being involved in the original release of this film I don't quite know how Borchers was able to steer this in such a wrong",1301788800,,3003,4.347593582887701

The children aren't as Sadistic, as they were in the original movie. They act out of a genuine, if to our perspective, mad, piety.

Isaac, lacks the Smarmyness, he had in the original, there It seemed he was just enjoying feeling important and being manipulative.

It also in other parts of the original Children of the corn series, suggested that the children were mind controlled.

The children aren't even in the least bit scary and the little boy who played Issac recites his lines like he's still trying to remember them. There is absolutely no atmosphere, eeriness or creepiness which the original movie had an abundance of. This version is stale and falls flat on its face. The male lead is the only one who is even slightly believable. Who wrote the script? I had to keep asking myself did they write this for adults.",1293926400,4,664,4.362903225806452
500937,3,6302720419,"The original ""Children of the Corn"" was well-done and very scary, but this remake was not nearly as good as the original.  The story line between the two movies remains pretty much the same; Vietnam vet Burt and his princess wife Vicki are headed to California for a second honeymoon.  After driving for many miles on I-80, Burt decides to pull off the interstate and continue on some back roads.  Their journey soon leads them to Gatlin, Nebraska.  While driving, the couple finds it very strange that there are no other cars or people around.  In the midst of arguing with Vicki, a small boy runs into the road and is struck by Burt.

Unsure of what to do next, they place the boy's body in the trunk of their car and head off to find the police.  However, there's no one in Gatlin: except for the children.  The children are lead by child preacher Issac and his teen enforcer Malachai.  Isaac has brainwashed the children into believing they are to follow the one known as He Who Walks Behind the Rows.  All of the adults in the town have been killed, and now Burt and Vicki have become their next targets of sacrifice.  Will Vicki and Burt make it out alive, or will the children succeed in making them human sacrifices?

This movie isn't very scary at all.  There is very little suspense, and most of what the viewer gets is scene after scene of Burt and Vicki arguing with each other.  The dialogue is lame, and the flashbacks of Burt fighting in Vietnam are a little far-fetched.

I recommend the original ""Children of the Corn"" over this remake.  The original is much scarier than this one.",1287014400,2,1598,4.496527777777778
500938,1,6302720419,"Good Grief, but was this truly hideous remake a big pile of--garbage!
We're treated to the most obnoxious and repulsive ""heroine"" ever to appear in a horror flick. As portayed by actress Kandyse McClure, ""Vicki"" is the wife from hell.  For the first thirty minutes, we're treated to her screeching, cursing, degrading her long suffering husband, David Anders, a recent Vietnam vet. The wife jeers and insults him in a non-stop barrage that never ends.  When the husband runs over a corn child, the wife turns up the insults and one wonders what the husband sees in her--and why he takes it.

When the wife is finally murdered, you want to applaud. And the rest of the movie is just one endless marathon were the husband runs through cornfields. His pursuers are so fat, you can imagine them ordering wash tubs of corn dogs during breaks.  Oh, yeah, we're also supposed to be scared of a little boy whose supposed to be the leader--yet, he comes off as a brat who needs his diapers changed real fast.

And then we have a bizarre sex scene where a teenage couple strip naked before all the other oorn children have sex--with the little ones all grinning and jumping up and down and leering at each other. You can imagine the director screaming: ""Act like you love it! Act like dirty little kids!""

As for the corn monster, there isn't one.  We see corn stalks shaking and then the hero begins to shriek hysterically and the next thing we're shone, is the hero trussed up like a scarecrow. This is a typical Sci-Fi Film, made on a poverty-row budget with a cast of no-name and no-talent performers. This woul be a fun movie to show at a Worst Movie of All Time Party--where it would join the ranks of other worst movie candidates like ""Rest Stop,"" ""Lake Placid II"" and ""100 Million BC"" starring King of the Z'--Christopher Atkins.",1286064000,9,1827,4.585889570552148

So when I heard about this one and even read the reviews I still gave it a chance, boy was I wrong, this was a total taken word for word from the short story, which I read a few days before I watched this remake. I actually liked the short story so I went into this movie with an opened mind. So I am going to say, that the problem is not the script, but more or less the presentation of it. The burt was ok, but the lady playing vicky was annoying as hell and made me wanna stab sissors in my ears. The kid playing isaac was boring dull and talked with a monotone voice, was not creepy, was not scary was not imposing or anything and made me wanna fall asleep as if I was in an old baptist church listing to a dull sermon. The guy that played Malachi was a joke he was not scary and did not have the same power the guy from the 1st was had. It was very thrown togather and sloppy. I also hated the teen sex secne in front of 9 year old kids, thought that was very tacky and not tastefull. Avoid this movie its not good and will make you fall asleep.

If I would have read the story by Stephne King first, I probably would have hated the original movie version, but both movies hold up. The revisioning does not show the slaughtering of the adult, do they really need to? The second version to me is more likely to happen than the first. Either way, both movies has its qualities and both deserve to be watched. I recommend watch both movies and then go read the story, then form an opinion.",1274486400,,598,4.208695652173913

The acting in both at least to me is decent-although Issac in this one sounds like a fire and brimstone preacher, in the original, he sounds and acts alot creepier.
As for Vicky-I like Linda's portrayal better, I'll be honest, but you need to remember, a crumbling marriage means all bets are off...sometimes, so I understand why she acted the way she did, admittedly though I like Peter Horton better too.
The music in both versions is good, the special f/x are good in both, more differences than comparisons, and the ending is more fitting for an SK movie this time-the evil is stopped but not destroyed, not to mention at a price, a terrible one at that!
To make a long story short-both versions are good to me, but maybe I'm too liberal for my own good. Re-makes can be good, as I've often said-and they shouldn't follow the original scene for scene anyway, when they do for me it ruins the story both ways, predictability isn't always a problem for me, but with re-makes, changing the story can make it more interesting-what RZ did with Halloween/Michael Myers was brilliant, same with Jason Vorhees.",1265932800,2,1256,4.713636363636364

500979,1,6302720419,"Children of the Corn (2009): 1 out of 10: Good lord did they screw this movie up. First, the writer (George Goldsmith) who adapted the original Children of the Corn is some sort of savant. Apparently all the good scenes in the original movie (The killing of the adults, Isaac and Malachi going at it in the climax, were his invention.) This movie cut all that good stuff out and replaced it with the Viet Cong and public child sex.

The blame rests squarely on Mr. Stephen King's shoulders. He did not like the changes the 1984 and wanted to stick to his original story. Therefore, the movie takes place in the mid-seventies and the main couple is a divorcing, squabbling mess. In addition, the main character hallucinates Viet Cong shooting in the corn which looks ten times worse than it sounds. Oh they have a sex scene in a church 'The time for fertilization has come!' where two teens have sex while nine year olds look on masturbating corn cobs.... good lord I didn't need to see that.

The casting is horrible. If I never see Kandyse McClure again (in the Linda Hamilton role) it will be to soon. She ruins the first half of an already horrible film. Daniel Newman as Malachi and Preston Bailey as Isaac ruin the second half. Daniel looks like he is reading off cue cards while Preston is about as threatening as a kitten.

Oh and if that all was not a big enough F You to the audience, the monster never shows up at the end.

It isn't like the original Children of the Corn was Casablanca or something but good lord this is an embarrassment for all involved.",1259280000,33,1566,4.445993031358885
500980,5,6302720419,"""Children of the Corn"" is one of those movies that leaves a connection with you after you've seen it. I remember when I was 11 or 12 and this movie was on TV, right in the beginning in the coffee house massacre scene. I remember being so frightened I had to switch channels! Being older, I can say that the movie's not as terrifying now, but ""Children of the Corn"" still has an eerie atmosphere that entices you all the way through.

If you can get past what may seem silly aspects that climax towards then end and enjoy the movie nonetheless, then ""Children of the Corn"" will definitely be a great watch. It's one of those '80s classics that's still just as entertaining, eerie, mystical and captivating now as it was in its own time. The setting in the abandoned, little Midwestern town is the perfect setting for this sort of movie, so that beefs up the quality of the film right there. In addition, the acting is quite good, and Isaac is one of the most sinister little punks I've ever seen on screen! Malachai too, plays an awesome villain, but whereas Isaac plays the darker, more evil villain, Malachai plays the more nuts-out, kick-a## sort of villain. The two of them work great together and lead the evil flock of children...gahh, it's starting to take its effect on me again!

Although ""Children of the Corn"" doesn't really have the humorous breaks in it that a lot of other horror movies do, it's certainly a great and enjoyable movie, that's most likely to captivate you with its dark, mysterious atmosphere. Pick this up in time for Halloween, too, to give yourself an extra reason to be scared and to love this time of year! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1256342400,2,1671,4.529801324503311
500981,5,6302720419,"Imagine being able to go back, and re-shoot what is regarded as  Classic film the way YOU wanted to the first time but were afraid to.. Imagine a story, from the King of Horror, filmed the way it should have been the first time?

If you can, then you have the NEW Children of the Corn, refilmed and rewritten by Donald P Borchers (based on the King short story).  If you liked the original, then you will be shocked by this version.  Firstly, this is horror/suspense the way it should be done.  The horror/suspense is aided by the big question, what the hell is going on in Gatlin, Nebraska?  Secondly, where are all of the people?  Why does it seem that time has stood still?

Burt and Vicki, an unhappily married couple about to seek divorce, travel through Nebraska just because.  A lonely stretch of road puts them corn country, and in the path of an escaping little boy.  Striking him with his Thunderbird, they look for a place to report the crime, and discover the deserted town of Gatlin.  The year is 1975 and Burt, a Viet Nam vet is still suffering from Post Traumatic Stress  Syndrome.  His wife, a preachers daughter, doesn't understand, and their marital tension builds just as the mystery before them escalated into a fight for their lives.  The children, led by a pre-teen preacher, Isaac and Malachai (his brother), control a large group of children who have lived 12 years without adults.  He who walks in the Corn, rules with fear, yet the fanatical, cult grip on the children in undeniable. As Borchers says in his special feature, one of the points he wanted to make that as mature individuals (and a society), we must not follow blindly, but rather be able to ask questions and seek wise guidance.  The youth, in this film, were the adults in the first film.  Placing youths in the main roles  creates another moral focal point that is accentuated as those above the age of 18 are sacrificed horrifically (denying their `mature' influence upon the youth), to personify `And a child shall lead them'.  That aside, as Vicki and Burt seek answers, the brutality of the children is obvious.  Stuck in an old testament mind set, sacrifice is the only solution.  Without it, there can be no absolution.  The outlanders, as Isaac puts it, are to be sacrificed so the Children of the Corn can become pure once more as those above 18 are purged one more time.

This is one frightening film.  The cinematography is outstanding.  The stark, empty town conveys and magnifies the blood lust while providing an atmospheric setting for the pursuit of the outlanders.  The cornfields serve to focus our attention on the conflict, and symbolize the conflict itself.  Where have all the parents gone????  The adults not only fertilized the object of their cult, yet also created it with their own `sinful' behaviours.  The `cross' has become a perverted corn decorated, symbol of evil and religious misunderstanding.  Where grace should be, blood sacrifice (Old Testament), rules supreme and no-one is safe.  The big question here is simple, how real is your faith?  What is it based on?

Whatever you come away with, you will never think of corn the same way again.

There is violence.  There is blood.  There is religious symbolism.  There is no redemption in Gatlin, Nebraska today.

(I live in Iowa, so this is an option!)  I had a few unintentional laughs, especially during the child killing spree the main protagonist went on during his escape attempt.  This film definitely has the highest body count of children killed in any horror film I've seen.  Between that and the ""sex scene"" in the film, I'm still shivering.  But anyway...  I digress.

""Children of the Corn,"" in case you actually are living in a cornfield, is a remake of a prior film of the same name, both of which are based on a Steven King story.  (I can still remember one of the creepy lines from the original film, although I haven't seen it in years: ""He wants you too, Malachi. He wants you, too."") The plot is quite interesting for a horror film: it's set in a small Nebraska town and revolves around a religious cult composed of children that worship a being that lives in the corn fields.  A husband and wife encounter the kids, and the events that follow make up the rest of the story.  I'll not go into it in more detail, as other reviews have done it in already.

Unlike a lot of people, I don't mind so much that Hollywood is hell-bent on making endless remakes, but I wish they would at least make a better remake.  This film is in no way better than its predecessor.  The acting is atrocious - not that they were given very good dialogue.  The lines were forced, and the actors are stiff and unbelievable.  The special effects are laughable and, if you can believe it, worse than the 1984 film.  So much for progress.  I think that I read that the SyFy (formerly known as Sci-fi) channel backed the making of this film or something to that effect.  I've gotten to the point where if I see Sci-fi channel on a DVD, I run.... I turn around and flee for my life. This movie should have been no different, but I only found this out post-viewing.  If the idea of this film is interesting to you, by all means, go watch the original film.  It's far superior.  You've been warned! :)",1255046400,26,2144,4.385786802030457
500984,1,6302720419,"The DVD version has a nude sex scene with two of the ""children"" getting it on (on top of a church altar) in front of an audience of 5 to 18 year olds.  How's that for classy?  I don't remember anything like that in Stephen King's original short story but the makers of this film swear they are being faithful to the source material.  In many ways they are but this film is so ineptly executed that it is an even bigger insult to Stephen King than the original (not so bad) film was.

The only bright spot in this rancid remake is Daniel Newman as Malachi.  That guy can act and he gives Courtney Gaines a run for his money with his amazing and sympathetic portrayal of Malachi.  Aside from Newman the rest of the acting is simply awful, particularly from the ""children"" who seem barely able to speak english.  The kid playing Isaac isn't even elementary school play material.  This kid is an absolutely rotten actor.

The script, while in theory is closer to the story, brings in all sorts of nonsense about Burt being a Viet Nam vet who is apparently experiencing post-traumatic stress in the corn field (and of course we get the obligatory flash back sequences). If you thought the original film was slow paced, try sitting through this snooze fest.  Burt and Vicki yack and yack with a dead body in the trunk and then Burt wanders through the corn for a half hour experiencing flash backs that are just pointless and sleep inducing.

And guess what?  The original film had BETTER visual effects in it than this one since this remake has ABSOLUTELY NO visual effects whatsoever.  YOU WON'T SEE HE WHO WALKS BEHIND THE ROWS IN THIS FILM.  Not even a glimpse.  Not even a big fluffy glowing cloud formation.  Not a gopher from hell in sight.  NOTHING.  THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER.
What a complete waste.  Yes the movie ends like the story with Burt and Vicki dead on crosses with their eyes gouged out but to see the actual end of the film you have to watch the credits all the way to the end and then the film picks up again with the children out in the corn field about to act out the finale of the film.  Why on earth this was done is a complete mystery.  Perhaps incompetent director Donald Borchers forgot to film any connecting scenes and decided to show the credits before inserting the final portion of the film.  Who knows.  It's all so amateurish, awful and absurd that you won't care and probably won't make it through more than a few minutes of this entirely terrible film.

Well...maybe not entirely terrible as the set design in the church is a little better than in the first film and the haunting theme music of Johnathan Elias is retained for this version.  And of course there is the truly excellent performance by Daniel Newman as Malachi.

501015,2,6302720419,"In 1984 Stephen King gave the world a reason to fear the children of Nebraska by writing Children of the Corn. Usually kids run around causing minor mischief pissing off a few parents here or there. However these kiddies are a bit different. Instead of the normal path, they form a murderous cult taking out every adult in sight. This is a concept that no doubt would reduce Santa to jif causing him to then swing his FTL's around over his head in a clear plastic bag. Since it has a good cult following the Sci-fi channel thought it must be a good idea to do a remake. Usually the remake idea never follows through well as was the case with Children of the Corn.

In this version we have a couple, with their marriage on the rocks, taking a little road trip. As they cruise through the cornfields of Nebraska they plow down a kid who runs across the road. Obviously not helping the marriage counseling process. Now they're freaking out and notice the kid's throat was slit and decided to get all Tommy Boy on him by throwing him in their trunk. As they come to the next town they soon find a pack of little punk kids of supernatural sorts and are forced into battle. After about a half hour into the film it really starts to go downhill. The main characters acting gets way to corny as he challenges the kids using his military experience. It's quite hilarious to watch this guy get chased down by some kids as young as 7, not all being male.

So in conclusion, the remake had nowhere near the effect the original had. There were some legit moments of enjoyment and even a couple laughs along the way. Unfortunately there wasn't enough to keep you interested. Even from a strictly B standpoint it couldn't work. Now we don't want to be too critical so have to  give some credit being that it was a sci-fi channel picture that was a cut above most. Compared to their usual disasters like Grizzly Rage or Mega Snake this one ranks high on their list. As far as a recommendation we can only say feel free to check it out when it's on t.v, but please don't spend $20 some odd dollars.

501016,2,6302720419,"Children of the Corn (Donald P. Borchers, 2009)

Fritz Kiersch first adapted Stephen King's chilling story ""Children of the Corn"" for the big screen in 1984. It, and its many, many sequels, have become staples on the Syfy Channel (and its recent spinoff Chiller) in the intervening years. By now, the original is a certified cult hit, despite the fact that as a movie, it really kinda blows. (Okay, remove the ""kinda""; the only big-screen King adaptation that's sillier is ""Graveyard Shift"", and that's at least so over-the-top stupid it deserves some recognition.) So when Don Borchers, who wrote the screenplay for the underrated Grace Jones vampire flick Vamp, and King himself set out to make a new adaptation, they didn't have to raise the bar too high to make it better. Aside from a few screens, they did an admirable job.

I don't know how it escaped me in all the years since I first read the short story (which happened, I think, in 1978) that ""Children of the Corn"" is a Vietnam War allegory. (You know, cornrows, thick foliage, jungle...) It makes sense, though, and Borchers and King bring that out a lot more in this adaptation. They also make a couple of other changes, some of which work, and some don't. In case you've never read the story (and by all means, you should do so at your earliest convenience), the plot: Vietnam vet Burt Stanton (Into the Blue 2's David Anders) and wife Vicki (Battlestar Galactica's Kandyse McClure) are on what's supposed to be a second honeymoon. Only it looks a lot more like it's going to wind up in divorce. Burt, sick of highway driving, got off the Interstate in Nebraska and decided to travel on back roads for a while. At one point during their bickering, a kid with his throat cut stumbles out onto the road, and Burt sees him too late. He decides he's going to drive to the nearest town and report the accident. Unfortunately, the nearest town is Gatlin, where, we learn in the opening scene (one of the big points against the movie; the best part of the story is finding all this out as we go along), a crazy kid had, twelve years earlier, incited the rest of the town's children to kill everyone over the age of nineteen, claiming God was speaking through him in the guise of something called He Who Walks Behind the Rows. (It's a bit more obvious in this movie, as well, who He Who Walks Behind the Rows really is... in case you didn't get the memo.) Since then, everyone is killed upon reaching their ""Day of Favor"" (nineteenth birthday), to keep up the sacrifices, keep the rain coming, etc., etc. Think of it as The Wicker Man, peewee-style. And needless to say, Burt and Vicki are over nineteen.

There are all sorts of interesting, somewhat perverse quirks in this flick. Sometimes when King goes back and revises his old stories for film, the result is just horrendous (look at the ""new ending"" for The Mist, for example), but most of what's here works just fine. The connotations of Vicki being black (the film, by the way, stays true to King's original mid-seventies setting--though I swear the story was set in 1978, while this version of the film is set in 1975) have been hotly debated on the IMDB message boards since the film originally aired, and I don't really have anything to add that hasn't already been said save that this is the kind of change I expect screenwriters to overplay, and it's not done here. Similarly, Burt's Vietnam War background is integrated nicely, especially in the flashback scenes, which feel less derivative than they do iconic (one in particular will strike you as very familiar, and it works here). The one change that doesn't work I can't tell you about, because it would spoil the film's biggest Big Reveal. But man, I can't believe they spent so much of their special effects budget on it. (You'll know it when you see it.)

On the other hand, what doesn't work in this movie, by and large, is the acting (or lack of same). Burt and Vicki are both played by capable actors (though McClure finds herself with a Judith O'Dea/Naomi Watts-style role, where most of the time she just has to scream), and Malachai, the town enforcer (Broken Bridges' Daniel Newman), has some acting chops. All the child actors, though, seem to have been chosen from headshots rather than acting ability. Most of those are small parts, so it's not a huge problem. Isaac the crazy preacher-kid is played by Dexter's Preston Bailey. You'd think someone who's been around for a couple of seasons of one of TV's highest-rated shows would have had some enunciation classes by now (and in many ways, Isaac is the film's actual main character). The other relatively large speaking role is that of Nahum, played by Paul Butler (of My Sister's Keeper); cute as a button, but not ready for speaking roles at this point in his career.

Still, acting problems and dumb special effects aside, this towers over the 1984 adaptation. Which doesn't make it a good movie by any means, but if you're sitting around with nothing to do on a Saturday night and you choice is between this and, say, Spring Break Shark Attack, you should definitely go for this one. ** ",1254268800,2,5130,4.638063806380638

501019,1,6302720419,"I was stoked when there were reports that the original Children of the Corn was being remade by the original film's producers.  Actually, the first time I heard this was about a month ago on the new Anchor Bay Blu-Ray release of the original film.  This is the type of film that should be remade.  The original film had its moments, but was ultimately more goofy then scary, and really strayed way too far from the original King short story.  I mean, come on!  If I knew 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" was an orange dust cloud with an animated skull in it mushrooming up into the air, I probably wouldn't have kept watching.

So here we are with yet ANOTHER REMAKE of a film from the 80's.  Sure, the original is no prize so I thought it novel to remake it.  Even better was the producers dusted off King's draft of the screenplay for the 1984 to act as their springboard.  Unfortunately, they rewrote it and made it even worse then the original.  It doesn't even have the benefit of the original's unintentional humor, and hysterically unscary lead baddie performance of Isaac.  The only thing this film retains from King's short story is the fact that our protagonists are the same bickering couple from the short story as opposed to the first film's in sync couple.  Guess what?  The acting is so annoying that instead of getting a couple that legitimately has problems we're just harranged for an hour and a hallf of a wife biting her husband's head off.  A husband who was a Vietman Vet, the remake is set in 1975.  So, guess who's suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome?  You guessed right, and the results are hilarious audio flashbacks at the film's climax, and bullet streaks flying through the air.  The director of this remake obviously wanted to make a statement in regard to violence and its effects in the real world, but I think it's more half baked window dressing then anything of meaning.

How can I be sure about the director's intentions?  Well, the DVD comes with a 45 minute making of doc that allows this pompous, talentless hack expause such lofty intentions.  I don't want to sound like a meanine, but this guy seriously spends just as much time putting down the original flick as he does talking up his new version.  It's almost like he doesn't take credit for being involved with the first Children of the Corn at all.  Really lame self promotion.  Oh, and if you're wondering if the great unholy God of this series actually shows up at the end of the film the way King described him in half a paragraph in the original story, you'll be bummed again.  Whether or not his final appearance is as lame as the original's orange mushroom cloud is up to you to decide.

The acting is all uniformly terrible.  It's by the numbers.  The only actors who seem to be trying are the possessed kids, but the problem with that is they come off more like petulent brats then malevolent demonic entities.  Sorry, I'm almost convinced that this King story can't be served well on the screen ever.  His main villains are small children.  Child actors just can't pull off the kind of otheworldly malevolence in any believable way.  Sure, they look cute and they're doing nasty things, but one never buys that they are truly evil, but more of a cheap horror effect.  Nothing gets to the more simple minded viewer faster and easier then showing a cute kid with a blank stare doing something awful.  It's cheap scare tactics that don't even work.

Bottom line, is this thing was premiered and made in conjunction with the Sci-Fi, oops, I mean Sy-Fy(the further dumbing of America in full evidence), so you know the hit and miss average of quality from past efforts.  I know there are many out there that have been waiting to see King's story finally get the proper treatment.  It's even worse knowing that King himself wrote a screenplay, THAT NO PRODUCER HAS EVEN USED OR EVEN CRIBBED FROM YET!  Why?  Maybe King should buy back the rights to his script and try making this thing on his own with Darabont or Garris--his most trusted film collaborators.  But by the time he sees this latest abomination I doubt the tiny shred of care left in him will allow him to give a damn anymore, if he even gives a damn at all.

It was like being forced to sit through couples therapy with two people who hated each other. The husband --  who was almost tolerable -- then turns all Vietnam-flashback crazy. The corn kids were creepy, but terrible actors. The little scripture-spouting prophet was the worst, and sounded like he was reading lines he didn't even understand. I truly had to force myself to watch this horrible thing all the way through. Not again. I like the original, and although this version perports to be closer to King's original story (which I read long ago, but don't remember well enough to say if this is true or not -- I certainly don't remember hating the protagnonists as much as I hated the two main characters in this movie!), it was truly and deeply unlikable on many levels.

My only real issue with this reboot/""re-imagining"" is that Preston Bailey who plays Isaac is terrible. It seemed as if he was handed his lines immediately before scenes were shot and was scrambling to get all of the words out before he forgot what he was supposed to say. Also, his delivery was just awful... he always used the same tone and never seemed to put emphasis on any of his words. John Franklin's performance as Isaac in the original was powerful and commanding, it was easy to see why even the older children would follow/fear him... here it's laughable when Malachi (Daniel Newman) takes orders from Isaac. Negatives aside, all of the other cast members played their parts well (Daniel Newman gave the best performance imo) and the blood/gore seemed to be of a higher quality than what's typical of a SciFi (SyFy) Original. Children of the Corn was actually a decent flick, worth watching at least once... don't go in expecting much, but don't let the ""SyFy Original"" tag completely scare you off either.",1253923200,14,1285,4.741071428571429

The newer version of Children of the Corn can best be described like this-

The film is divided into two parts-

- the first 45 minutes of film which involves the man and his wife arguing and fighting while riding up and down the streets of Nebraska looking at corn and searching for any kind of human activity.

- the second half of the movie which focuses on the husband running through cornfields trying to escape the children who are relentlessly after him.

The ending is a pretty big disappoinment though because it ends on a note where you're left feeling like the writers didn't complete the story all the way.

Besides that, stick with the original Children of the Corn.  It's much better.",1253923200,2,857,4.555555555555555

501068,4,6302720419,"""Children of the Corn""  is the 1984 adaptation of a Stephen King tale that turns children into monsters.  Following in the tradition of ""The Bad Seed"" and ""Village of the Damned,"" ""Children of the Corn"" sets out to shatter our notion that childhood is a time of innocence.  The opening scene grabs us right away.  In Gatlin, Nebraska, a small farming community, the good citizens follow church on Sunday with breakfast at the local coffee shop.  One morning, however, the town's children rise up against the adults, poisoning their coffee and slashing their throats in a violent, horrifying sequence.  Skip ahead three years.  Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton, Linda Hamilton) have a bad accident outside Gatlin and walk to town, searching for help.  But they find no adults.  Eventually, they discover that the children of Gatlin have formed a religious cult around an evil entity, ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows.""  Though far from a classic, this film has an enormous following and has inspired six sequels, five released directly to DVD.  Its appeal lies partly in the performances of the two young leads.  John Franklin plays Isaac, the nine-year-old prophet who organized the cult, and Courtney Gains portrays the odd-looking and unsettling Malachai.  Bonus extras include the featurette, ""Welcome to Gatlin: The Sight and Sounds of Children Of the Corn;"" an interview with Linda Hamilton; audio commentary by director Fritz Kiersch and actors John Franklin and Courtney Gains; and the documentary ""Harvesting Horror: Children of the Corn.""",1251244800,29,1540,5.161290322580645

That kid is so bizarre-looking, just creepy! And the Malachi character is a weasle, too!

I thought the movie moved along too fast and came to a head too quickly. It became predictable.

And what seemed unrealistic to me is how an entire town of kids could keep the town a secret for three years!! Hello? No Pepsi trucks, gasoline trucks, produce trucks, or other goods ever come into that town?  How about the mayor's office and the State of Nebraska?  How about property taxes, family members out of town, and commerce?  How could an entire town like that disappear and be run by kids? I'm a teacher, trust me, kids could not run a town this smoothly! lol

501115,2,6302720419,"I have a glimpse of a memory from when I was ten or so.  It is of this film's climax, giant fields of corn, some sort of malevolent creature burrowing through the ground like a mole on coke, and crosses of corn exploding into the air.  I only saw fragments because my parents were watching the film, but at the time, it freaked me out.

This is probably because my father is a Baptist minister, lending all sorts of sobriety to the image of crosses, and also because I grew up in southeast Missouri, around dozens and dozens of cornfields.

I wanted to be scared like that again, so I got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children/dp/B0001W1BZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/of/dp/B00005NTMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">of</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the/dp/B00005NTN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corn/dp/B00005NTN1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corn</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ser/dp/B00000K31U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ser</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ies/dp/B00005NTN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ies</a>.  Instead of being scared, however, I have been afforded the opportunity to warn others of my mistake.

In the first five minutes of this film, all the children of the podunk town of Gatlin, Nebraska kill every last citizen over the age of 19.  That's the first five minutes, mind you.  The entire incident is narrated nonchalantly by young Job (Robby Kiger), who is annoyed that his mother and father have been slain, but who isn't necessarily put out by the ordeal.

Because, you see, Job and his sister Sarah (who, for no reason whatsoever, can draw the future), are kept alive by the band of murderous children, who are acting at the behest of Issac, a legitimately creepy child who is acting as the prophet of He Who Walks Behind the Rows (of corn).  Issac is played by John Franklin, a twenty-five year old whose Growth Hormone Disorder makes him seem just the right kind of disturbing for the part.  After murdering all of the adults, the town of Gatlin enters a three-year grace period, where, for some reason, absolutely no investigation or inquiry is made into the town's sudden lack of taxpayers.  What, the relatives of these murdered adults don't worry that their family doesn't respond to mail or phone calls?  How is that this place still gets electricity, gas, and water after all of the breadwinners have been dispatched?  Ah, but I'm thinking too much.  Ha ha.  Silly me.

Anyway, enter Burt (a laconic Peter Horton) and Vicky (a younger, sexier Linda Hamilton), two thirty-somethings entering the picture purely by accident when they happen to collide with Issac's latest victim, a young defector whose name I don't care to look up.

King has always taken issue with fundamentalism, and his work reflects that.  I can't testify to how true this film is to the short story that inspired it, but that fanatical religious fervor is present here in undiluted form.  Who knows what these kids are worshipping?  Not even them it seems.  Whatever it is, it enjoys bloodshed and corn, and it hates adults (if you define adult as 20+ years of age).

Aside from the story's basic incomprehensibility, the movie is uneventful and horribly acted.  It's a rough deal when the bulk of your cast is children, especially when said children are directed to act menacing.  The most violent child of all, Malachai (Courtney Gains), tries to leer and sneer with the best of them, but mostly what I noticed was his abnormally large mouth.  He screams a bit, Issac screams a bit, Burt takes it all in stride, and a kid named Amos gets a pentagram carved into his chest

It's all rather mundane and dull.  In fact, I think the movie glossed over the scariest part.  What I would've liked to have seen is the preface to all of this weirdness.  Instead of making a movie about the aftermath, they should've written a story about Issac discovering He Who Walks Behind the Rows, about him convincing an entire town of children to murder their parents.  That's what I thought the movie was about, actually (instead of it being the first five minutes).  And the sequels that followed?  Well, I assumed they would be about people coming to investigate why no one in Gatlin returns phone calls or has paid their credit card bills.  Now, I don't know what to expect.

501119,3,6302720419,"""...but it's safe."" is how the rest of the line goes.  But when the film begins with the slaughtering of adults in a small Nebraska town by all the children, it's far from that.  Children of the Corn is a unique horror film in that it blends children and cornfields, but other than that, this is a pretty lame and average scarefest.

Gatlin is the small Nebraska town where the action takes place.  Gatlin is now a ghost town, because the adults are ""in the cornfields"".  In other words, sacrificed by the orders of ""Isaac"" (John Franklin) the leader of the strange cult consisting of all children 18 years and younger.  Isaac teaches what he sees from the Bible, and even the assumption we get that the film's main character Burt is weary of Christianity, he still points out that these events are ridiculous and obsured.

Burt and Vicky are the unlucky young adults who travel through Gatlin, and end up getting trapped there due to roadsigns that have been misplaced to keep outlanders stuck.  Obviously, since the town is dry of adults, the children are always looking for visitors to sacrifice.  The majority of the film is slow paced, though mildly entertaining with suspense and chases.  The blood and gore factor is actually quite minimal, and nothing compared to today's standards.  Most of the time, the camera will pull away before someone is murdered.

The characters in this film are primarily the children and the two young adults.  Only Isaac and his henchman Malachai stood out with the most interest, looking and talking with decent intimidation, but in the end their lack of acting (as well as everyone else) keeps things at bay.  Horror movies aren't usually known for good acting, but this is below those standards.

Overall, the film has some originality to it and is worth a look, though its more of a way to kill 90 minutes it would seem.  It scares a bit here and there for the most part.  Apparently, though, someone liked it since it spawned 7 more sequals, though none of those really improved over this.

I think this movie could've been better off WITHOUT any sequels. Some of them were ok but others failed, I'll get to my reviews of those seperatly but anyways, I'll start talking about this one.

Well, at the start of the film, we are introduced to an awesome kick-ass scene where the ""children of the corn"", kill a bunch of adults in a diner, with some really cool effects.

Now we cut to present, where we are watching Linda Hamilton & Peter Horton in a motel room. It is his birthday, and they are both going to a new town because Horton has the job of a doctor. So they hit the road, and then hit a kid on the road, and more to their horror, he was already dead because the man notices his through severely cut out.

So then we find out all kids in the town killed every adult in the town, because they are in in some sort of a cult that gathers in the towns cornfields. Well, the only two normal people are these two kids. Their older borther was the one hit by the car. So they pretty much help the ouple defeat the god that all the kids worship, and happy ending.

I liked this film just because to 80s feel, the atmosphere really reminded me of Amish descent, and this had some great special effects and great gore/makeup scenes.

I gave this movie three stars because of originality and because the guy who played Issac looked really weird. Like androgynous weird. Turns out he has a lack of growth hormones. I say it worked out perfectly.

The movie can be a sleeper during some parts but it does have its moments which I won't reveal here. The acting done by the kids was pretty decent and the area of Iowa they chose to film this horror movie in contributed to the overall mood of the piece.

Video quality is top notch since Anchor Bay used their proprietary Divimax process which is their way of putting a fancy label to high definition. And it's a good thing they did. There was still some ""subtle"" grain in certain parts if you can believe that. Imagine buying the non-Divimax editions out there. Don't do it! Trust me.

501153,3,6302720419,"Like the majority of adapted Stephen King stories, this 80's horror flick falls short of the source material, although it's pretty cool to actually see the source material on the screen. (Literally, a paperback copy of Night Shift is on the dashboard in front of Linda Hamilton in the opening driving sequence).

The original story is only 30 pages long and a little different from the movie, but again, like the majority of King's work, it just doesn't transfer directly to the screen. The story is slightly modified, but not terribly so. One day the children in a small town decide to rise up and kill all the adults in the town in order to worship HE WHO WALKS BEHIND THE ROWS. This plot-line goes back to one of King's semi-obsessions: the idea that there are small towns out there so remote that no one would even notice when an entire town is massacred and deserted... that is, until a pair of unsuspecting travelers happen upon it.

Rating this movie based on special-effects and film quality standards of today would hardly be fair, and I have a feeling that for the 80's this was a quality film, but obviously, today the climactic scenes, and some stuff leading up to that are pretty ""corny""... I knew I'd have to say that.

I haven't seen any of the sequels, and I suspect they're not that great, but this film is worth the time to watch if you're into horror movies.

Based on a short story by Stephen King, this is a fairly interesting and unusual concept. Unfortunately, some very weak execution is what mars the movie. Its director, Fritz Kiersch, sometimes works as ""Alan Smithee,"" the pseudonym for directors who don't want to attach their real names to movies they know are turkeys. This movie doesn't quite warrant that, though it isn't very good either. There is scarcely anything more pathetic than a movie that claims to be frightening, yet simply is not. Most egregious is the use of hokey, faux sacred music. Aside from Linda Hamilton, John Franklin and Robbie Kiger, the performances are pretty weak. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue is laughably bad and that some of the special effects are cheap and look awful. Isaac Chroner (Franklin) instructs the children of the town to murder all but one adult, who is apparently needed to warn potential visitors against entering the town. His advice nearly prevents Vicky and Burt Stanton from seeking medical help there, but darker forces prevail and the couple finds itself fending off attacks from the kids. If the excessively dramatic acting and cheesy effects at the climax do not make you laugh, the incredibly lame final scene certainly will. That is not to say this movie is all bad, however. Though never scary, there are a few effective moments throughout. (I don't want to reveal any of them because they would be the only reasons for watching the movie)  Die hard horror fans might want to check out this 1984 release, though fans of good movies will probably want to steer clear. This Anchor Bay DVD is anamorphic widescreen with good picture and sound, though this is not the director's cut.",1159747200,6,1853,4.863924050632911
501156,3,6302720419,"I just bought this film around last Halloween. I'd never seen 1984's ""Children Of The Corn,"" and as a lover of Old School horror, I was anxious to watch it. I've seen horror films much, much gorier than this, but you really don't need a lot of it to have yourself a good horror flick. Sometimes just the power of suggestion is enough to scare the heck out of you. This film shows you just the right amount of both and it is an enjoyable movie for the 80's horror fans. It may be a bit too tame for the hardcore horror fans, but it's a pretty good film based on Stephen King's novel.

Welcome to the sleepy town of Gatlin, Nebraska......maybe a little too sleepy.....like a dead sleepy. Indeed the town is ghostlike, save an evil religious cult of kids who have brutally slaughtered all the adults and left deranged satanic paintings and trails of cornhusks all over town. Cornhusks? Yes, cornhusks. This violent group of evil holds their main base in a huge cornfield in the lazy Nebraska flatlands. Lead by Isaac (John Franklin), a preacher who spreads the word of  ""He who walks behind the rows,"" and Malachai (Courtney Gains), Isaac's pawn who carries out the deity's wishes in the most gruesome of ways, the cult has taken Gatlin as their own and goes out to ""spill blood"" of any ""outlanders."" Oh yes, and that includes any members of the cult who decide to betray the corn deity. But this cult is strictly for youthful beings. According to ""He who walks behind the rows"": ""And a child shall lead them.""

Vicky (Linda Hamilton) and Burton (Peter Horton), are two unfortunate adults who have traveled to this pitiful Nebraska town, as Burton is preparing for a job as a doctor. After getting caught in a horrible accident on the vacant road near the corn, the two decide to venture into Gatlin to seek help. They quickly find that people keep a little too much to themselves in Gatlin and all they find are shops littered with the sacrilegious corn creations and a bunch of strange youngsters wielding blades. The only bright spot they find is two little kids who have not yet been sucked in to the beliefs of the cult; Job (Robby Kiger) and his psychic-drawing sister Sarah (Anne Marie McEvoy). Together, the four of them work up a plan to escape from the horrible corn cult members and find a way to banish the evil deity from the cornfield. Can you say, ""burning stubble?"" But it won't be easy. Isaac's preaching easily contaminates the minds of those around him, and Malachai's thirst for slashing and blood dominates his every waking hour. It's a powerfully evil combination that makes a cult of kids a true hellish nightmare.

Personally, I thought the overall acting was mediocre at best when I first viewed ""Children Of The Corn."" After seeing it a few times more since, I've narrowed it down to two people. Linda Hamilton's acting as Vicky can be downright annoying with her persistent ""Can we leave now?"" ""I don't think this is a road,"" and ""Just tell me where we are."" And that birthday song she sings for Burton at the start of the movie makes me grit my teeth with pain. Her acting could have been a lot better if she put a bit more feeling into her lines. It just seemed flat to me somehow. I didn't think Peter Horton as Burton was too bad, although his mocking of the religious speeches on his car radio was less than amusing. His acting was a little flat at times too, but not as bad as Hamilton's. He has an earnestness about him during the more intense scenes when he's confronting the cult of kids, trying to get Sarah to talk to him, and working with Job to cast away the evil deity. It comes across as fairly genuine and he actually sucked me into his character. John Franklin was incredible as Isaac! His eyes are dark and evil and he can do a mean twisted smirk. When he preaches, he puts that umph behind every word; demanding.....earnest.....insistent.....just like a true fire and brimstone preacher desperately trying to get his point across. Courtney Gains as Malachai was probably my favorite though. That guy was just downright disturbing with his evil, narrowed eyes, devilish grin and warped scowl. His voice is seething, intense and loud, as if stretching every vocal chord in his throat. The sight of him with a blade was unnerving. The little kids, Job and Sarah were fairly well cast. They really capture the youth and innocence, not to mention normality that used to be in Gatlin, and really help contrast this with the evil that they are surrounded by. This bipolar tension makes the movie good.

The music fits this film so well. During attacks that are about to reach a climax, we hear a loud church-choir like group speak/sing in melodic, intense religious chants. It is absolutely awesome! And again there is the sweet tension there; the religious chants, which are supposed to be good, being sung while evil is being done. The main title theme features high haunting vocals from youth; no words, just notes. It really captures the intensity of the film that much more.

I guess I should get to my favorite scene, huh? Well, I actually have two. I'm a fan of horror, so I like intensity. Two of the most intense scenes come in the first part of the film when the cult slaughters the adults in the caf and when Malachai sends Joseph to his maker while he's trying to escape. The attack wounds look pretty real and the makeup is very well done. The props are great too; all the cornhusks and evil drawings in the stores, and I also need to mention that dusty town of tumbleweeds, corn fields, old farms and empty rat infested stores. The feeling of isolation in a sleepy town with nothing but evil to come get you, just screams at you. Included in this film is also the original theatrical trailer. Nothing major, but still a kick to watch, and the narrator of it has a voice made for horror.

Well, I think I've said all I need to say about ""Children Of The Corn."" Whether you want a fairly disturbing scare, a nostalgic trip back to the 80's horror days, or just a plain old horror film for Halloween, grab up 1984's ""Children Of The Corn.""",1155168000,5,6086,4.547445255474453

501158,4,6302720419,"There's just something about a movie that has children killing adults and running the show that freaks everyone out. I guess it plays on the same kind of fears that movies that have bee's taking over the world do. We treat children like they're a nusance, so they rise up against their aggressors, adults, and most likely succeed because adults discredit kids. Huh......

Well that's at least what I got from this movie.

When I watch a horror movie I look for three basic things. First, is the acting up to par and is the movie well made? Second, how are the special effects and the death sequences? Finally, does the end of the movie deliever and wrap things up?

In the first category this movie does really well. You can tell from the beginning that the movie was probably made on a very small budget, but the camera work, and everything else was done extremely well. The acting is also pretty good for such a low budget movie. Terminator girl does a terrific job, as well as all of the kids, especially the leader. Malaki, or the red-headed bully stumbles over his lines, but he does a half decent job. So yeah, the movie delievers here.

* Oh, something to watch for. When the main character is running away from the children who are chasing him, and calling him lap lander, or excuse me OUT-lander, he runs into the barn. It is dark in the barn and he ""hits"" his head on a beam. It's incredibly hilarious because you can sooooo tell, he fakes it.

Secondly, does the movie have decent special effects and death sequences? Yes and no. Yes because some of the special effects are pretty good, but there isn't that many of them, nor killing sequences. The kids go on a rampage in the beginning and then, that's pretty much it. There is a lot of suspense in the movie, which does creep you out, but no real need for crazy special effects. The special effects are okay. At the end they look pretty cheesy, but hey low-budget movie so what are you going to do?

Finally does the ending wrap the movie up? This movie certainly does. It takes all the elements of the story and wraps them up into a neat pacakage at the end. Like I said, the special effects are a little cheesy but alright. It's nothing you can't see coming, but it has some little twists which keep you watching.

So all in all, this is a pretty good movie. It's gotten a bad wrap for some reason, but there will always be a book versus movie battle for every book they turn into a movie. I never have read the book, so I can't throw my two cents in here. Anyway, it would be worth the buy at Walmart for 6.50, rather than renting it.",1147824000,3,2600,4.348453608247422

501170,3,6302720419,Children of the Corn~ Peter Horton is an alright horror movie that falls on its inconsistent script. The charachters of Isac and Malicai (spelling) are interesting as a conecept but they are not developed nearly enough. The acting is also very inconsistent and whilst the actor that portrays Isac does a great job the rest of the acting is anywhere from b movie acting (the hero) to downright shoddy (his girlfriend). The music is great at times but other times it feels like it was done as an afterthought. The special effects are quite cheap looking and the end could have been so much more. Still I will watch the rest of this series just out of sheer curiosity and still it is not a bad movie.

It is about a couple who travel to a town called Gatlin and meet some creepy kids who all follow a special diety. The children want to add the couple to their ""collection"", and give their souls to ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"". Thier is also no gore in the film, exept for the slaughter at the beginning at the coffee shop.

501173,3,6302720419,"Following in the tradition of such Stephen King movies as ""The Shining"", this move uses psychological terror with blood and gore to scare viewers.

The movie takes place in Gatlin, Nebraska. A young couple, Burton (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton), are travelling through rural America.  Burton has just graduated from medical school and is on his way to his first internship.  However, the pair end up getting lost and accidentally run over a person who has emerged from one of the fields alongside the road.  Unsure of what to do, Burton places the body in his trunk.  Eventually, Burton and Vicky decide that they need help and begin looking in Gatlin.

They soon realize there are no adults in Gatlin; only children.  The children have brutally murdered all of the adults and started a cult which worships the corn and someone known as ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"".  The cult is led by Isaac (John Franklin) and Malachai (Courtney Gains).  After watching, the viewer learns that the true presence is not IN the corn, but UNDER it.  Burton and Vicky must get out of Gatlin at all costs or die at the hands of Isaac, Malachai, and the other cult members.

I thought this was a good movie, but not as scary as I had hoped.  Some parts, such as the scenes of the thing running through the fields undergound was scary, but there was little else.  Isaac's and Malachai's struggle for control over the cult was thrilling to see, but I thought Horton and Hamilton gave only average performances.  John Franklin, however, was very good as the man-child Isaac, while Gains' portrayal as Isaac's right-hand man and eventual antagonist Malachai was equally good. The many unanswered questions, such as what ever happened to the body in the trunk, and what is the thing under the rows of corn, are frustrating.

I recommend this movie, but I do feel that it could have been better.  However, the psychological suspense of not knowing what was going to happen next was evident in the movie.  The producers must have done something right, because there were several sequels made to this movie.  I've been a fan of Stephen King movies for years, but I wish this one would have been a little better.",1138838400,,2196,4.704188481675392
501174,2,6302720419,"This movie ain't as bad as some people make it out to be, but it's pretty silly, definitely.  'Children of the Corn' is a pretty great short story, but it seems like it would be tough if not impossible to make it into a good film.  It's got a few decent moments, with a nice little massacre at the beginning, and the guy who plays Malachi is pretty cool, and that Courtney dudes 'Outlander!' speech is fun, but overall it's rather silly and uneventful.  Horton and Hamilton are incredibly dull as the leads, and they don't really get the kids right either.  They make 'em out to be like murderous Amish people, and while this may be a fairly reasonable interpretation of the story it doesn't really work.  They should be more feral, but whatever.  Also, 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' is really extraordinarily poorly done, and is a sort of murder-cloud, or something.  Also, Hamilton didn't have her eyes gouged and tongue-ripped out and the holes crammed with corn silk and husks.  Weak.

Whether or not you wanna see this depends on how much you like crappy horror movies.  I like them quite a lot, but I'm certainly not gonna tell anyone they need to see this movie, even if I can't quite tell you to avoid it either.  However, do check out 'Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice'.  I haven't seen that in years, but I distinctly recall it being a lotta fun, definitely better than this one.

I saw this movie originally when I was like 13 years old and it was scary back then.  Now...well, we're all grown up...so the horrors have become tarnished with age.

501190,3,6302720419,"So how did such a mediocre film warrant six sequels (here's a hint...it's all about the money)?  There's the original. Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice (1993), Children of the Corn III (1995), Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering (1996), Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror (1998), Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return (1999), and Children of the Corn: Revelation (2001)...that's a lot of corn, or as the Native Americans call it, maize...I've seen the original, but not the subsequent sequels...my gut instinct tells me to avoid them.  Children of the Corn, aka Stephen King's Children of the Corn (1984), directed by Fritz Kiersch (Tuff Turf, Gor) features a solid cast including Peter Horton (""thirtysomething"") and Linda Hamilton (Terminator 2: Judgment Day). Also appearing is R.G. Armstrong (Dick Tracy), Courtney Gains (Colors, The 'burbs) and John Franklin, who appeared 1991 film The Addams Family, along with its' 1993 sequel, as the very hairy Cousin Itt.

The film, which primarily takes place in the small farming town of Gatlin, Nebraska, begins with a flashback, relating a particularly gruesome incident in where the children depopulate the town of nearly all adults through a good old fashion bloodbath. Fast forward three years to the present, and we have Burton (Horton) and his girlfriend Vicky (Hamilton) traveling through the Midwest as Burton has recently graduated from med school, and has been offered an internship somewhere...but that's neither here nor there as the pair get lost, have an accident, and soon find themselves looking for aid in Gatlin...but guess what? Gatlin appears all but deserted...except for the children, who've formed some kind of weird cult, led by the incredibly creepy man-child Isaac (Franklin). Initially their idolatry seems to be centered on the corn, but later we learn it's not so much the corn as what lurks under the corn. Burton and Vicky soon find themselves in a world of trouble, as the corn is thirsting for holy sacrifices, and they're at the top of the list (I wouldn't mind initiating a religious ceremony with that Linda Hamilton...that is the soft and sexy Linda from the original Terminator movie, not the bony and intensely scary Linda from T2: Judgment Day)...

The film is based on a Stephen King short story taken from his book Night Shift, which I've never read, but I have read a number of his other books, many of which were later adapted to film, with varying degrees of success...anyone else besides me sit through Maximum Overdrive? Okay, Children of the Corn isn't as bad as that was, but it is lacking something...it's not the acting...Horton, whom I despise for no other reason than he was on that TV show `thirtysomething' was actually pretty good. As far as Linda Hamilton, well, I think she's a good actress, provided she's given something to work with, and that wasn't the case here. The real fun is watching the performances of Franklin and Gains, as Isaac and Malachai, respectively. Franklin is extremely disconcerting as the leader of the group, mainly because his appearance is that of a child, but a closer look would make you think twice as his face and voice seem to indicate some much older. Turns out Franklin, who suffered from some sort of hormone deficiency, was actually much older, like 23 at the time of the film's release. As far as Gains, he presents the most intense performance as Isaac's enforcer and right hand man, but I felt like he got into it just a little too much (in the featurette Gains speaks of his craft and how he brought his character to the screen...I do appreciate it when actors give to the screen, but I think Gains took his modest role a bit too seriously, trying to make more of it than it was...but since the production in general was pretty bland, this overacting wasn't necessarily unwelcome). These two guys come off really good as the antagonists, mainly because they're so completely annoying I wanted to beat them both to a pulp (wait for the scene when Malachai is walking down the center of the street calling for Burton to come out, yelling `Outlander!""...you'll understand what I mean by annoying). As far as the direction, I have no real complaints, as Kiersch seems capable...in the featurette he speaks a lot of what he was trying to accomplish with regards to the sense of direction, and in some areas I think he met his goal, but others I think his aspirations extended beyond his capabilities. So what's the problem with the film? It's the story...well, not the original story, but the adaptation of the story. As I said, I'm familiar with many of King's works, and I know he takes a lot of time to craft his tales, utilizing detail like it was going out of style. I think one of the things that makes his story so popular is his ability to paint a visual using words...and he also seems to do this in terms that are accessible to an extremely wide audience. And I think this is a main factor that ends up hurting many of the films that are adapted from his novels...they lack the focus on what's important to the story. I think this is why we are seeing his more recent works produced as television mini-series...because more time can be spent developing the story and presenting the details, in my opinion.

The Divimax edition, released by Anchor Bay Entertainment features a really sharp looking wide screen (1.85:1) print, enhanced for 16 X 9 TV's, and the audio is exceptionally clear and crisp.

501191,3,6302720419,"The success ratio for Stephen King movies would not indicate what a successful writer Mr. King has been.  This one, CHILDREN OF THE CORN, is one of his adaptations that isn't quite bad as some (Thinner, Cujo), but can't reach the best (Carrie, Dead Zone, Dreamcatcher).  The short story is not one of King's real winners and adding padding to the story for the movie didn't help much.  However, there is an eerie atmosphere within the movie, and the concept of a town ruled by children is to say the least unsettling.

Peter Horton's character, Burt, is annoying as he spends most of the time doing stupid things and arguing with his supposed significant other.  Linda Hamilton is listless and unusually ineffective.  The rest of the cast goes through the motions, although Courtney Gaines as Malachi has a malevolent presence that adds to the foreboding of the movie.  John Franklin (who played Cousin Itt on THE ADDAMS FAMILY) neither looks nor sounds like a kid, but that might have been the director's intention.

This is classic horror.  The movie takes not just things we have looked out before, but things we have never really seen.  We hear religious fundamentalist all the time on the TV and radio.  We see corn fields often enough.  But we never really think much about them.  This story jumps into the imagination and makes the ordinary terrifying.  This is a good story.

The movie takes the farm country and religious fundamentalism and wraps them together with a twist.  A child, Isaac, gets visions, which tell him to create a new religion, killing all the adults.  Further, no adults shall be suffered to live.  His religion has some fundamentalist undertones, but also some bizarre rituals and ideas.  Oddly enough, this movie doesn't actually insult religion, but seems to ask the question, ""What if what they said was real?""

501193,3,6302720419,"No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.

""Children of the Corn,"" hammered together from a King short story, introduces us to freshly minted physician Burt (Peter Horton) and his significant other Vicky (Linda Hamilton) as they are driving across the country to Burt's first post-medical school stint. The arduous journey begins to takes its toll on the two as they wander through the Midwest, specifically Nebraska. Nothing but open skies, cornfields, and ranting preachers on the airwaves are around to keep Burt and Vicky entertained, and that doesn't last too long. There is also some tension between the two concerning their relationship, with Burt suffering from the predictable ""guy scared to make a commitment"" mentality we've seen in nearly every film made since the beginning of the twentieth century. These problems soon take a backseat, however, when Burt accidentally plows his car into a boy standing in the middle of the road. A cursory examination of the body reveals a shocking revelation: instead of perishing as a result of the car accident, someone slashed this kid's throat moments before the couple came along. Burt searches the cornfield a few yards off the highway and finds a suitcase spattered with blood, further evidence that something quite grim is afoot. The city slickers resolve to head to the nearest town, Gatlin, to report the apparent murder.

They soon discover that finding Gatlin is about as easy as finding El Dorado. Signs pointing the way to the town seem to contradict one another. Even the tentative help they get from a crusty old gas station attendant, who also tells them to avoid the town in a way that evokes memories of Crazy Ralph from ""Friday the 13th,"" doesn't initially help them. Nonetheless, Burt and Vicky soon roll into what looks like a ghost town. Cornhusks adorn the buildings and blow through the streets like tumbleweeds. The stores are decrepit, refuse filled shells. Even the courthouse looks like a neutron bomb went off inside. Only when Burt and Vicky stumble over two kids playing a board game in an abandoned house, Job (Robby Kiger) and Sarah (AnnMarie McEvoy), do they begin to understand the horror residing in Gatlin, Nebraska. We the audience learned long before what happened, and what continues to happen, in this strange place. Some years before the children in the town fell under the influence of youthful preacher named Isaac (John Franklin), a scary looking kid who ordered his adherents to murder every adult in town because ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" commanded such an action. With the help of his beefy henchman Malachai (Courtney Gains), Isaac continues to perform bizarre rituals that allow him to keep the others in line. Obviously, Burt and Vicky must challenge his authority, and the legitimacy of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows,"" if they wish to survive.

The first film, you will hear stalwarts say over and over again, isn't that bad of a movie. In fact, a few of them will look you straight in the eyes and say ""Children of the Corn"" is not only one of the best horror films out there, it is also one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations ever to grace the silver screen. These are the individuals who will one day find employment as circus barkers, car salesmen, or politicians. ""Children of the Corn"" starts out with lots of promise, about a minute's worth, which gives these apologists' opinions an initial veneer of respectability. After Vicky sings that song to Burt at the hotel room, the movie starts its long decline into banality. The road scenes run on forever, the presence of the elderly gas station attendant is a horror film clich, and we never see the demonic force stalking through the cornfields. Worse, there is little gore and the special effects, particularly during the final showdown between the outsiders and the demon, attain the heights of laughable cheesiness. The only bright spots in the film are Isaac and Malachai, in large part due to their sneering visages and the biblical mumbo jumbo they spout every time they appear onscreen.

I just learned Anchor Bay released a Special Edition disc of ""Children of the Corn"" complete with a commentary track and featurette. The version I watched--the ""unspecial"" edition, perhaps?--contained only the film and a trailer. As boring as the picture is, I'm still going to give it three stars because several of the sequels that follow it make this one look like ""Citizen Kane."" Give it a watch if you must, but be prepared for a big disappointment.",1103846400,3,5730,4.849846782431052

If I was to pick any of my favorite Steven King classics, this would be one of them. It is about 2 people who are driving through Nebraska and they come across an apparently dead kid in the road. Everyone else there worships a cornfield and has weird rituals and stuff. They must enjoy killing people because it is part of their mumbo-jumbo religion which is one that you don't see everyday. The ending is also very violent and it has a good plot. I think the end is one of it's best parts! The cornfield death is just a little gory too. This movie is definetely recommended if you like Stephen King's stuff. Peace out.",1102118400,,767,4.296551724137931
501195,3,6302720419,"Gosh... what to say about ""Children of the Corn""?

First off, let me say: this is no masterpiece.  But, at the same time, it is no disasterpiece, either.  I'm a big-time Stephen King fan, and while this is the film adaptation of his work that comes in for the most lambasting, it is really nowhere near the worst King film.  (Look to either ""Thinner"" or to ""Sleepwalkers"" for that odious distinction.)

I'm not going to say much about the movie, really.  It is what it is, and odds are that you already know whether or not you like this sort of thing.

Instead, I'd like to focus on the features done for this special edition DVD.  First off, the picture and the sound quality are WAY better than might have been expected (or possibly even deserved).  The film has probably never looked or sounded better, even when it was first released.

The documentary is about 35 minutes long, and relies on interviews with director Fritz Kiersch (who comes off as a knowledgeable and likeable man) and the actors who portrayed Isaac and Malachi (both of whom are funny and relazed about what they realize ain't exactly the finest thing since Citizen Kane).  It's a good documentary, although perhaps a bit too quick to try and posit the film as an overwhelming success.  The commentary track features the same participants, and is a good listen.

Not surprisingly, Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton ar enowhere to be found in the supplements, and don't even dream of an interview with Stephen King, for you will find one not.

All in all, this is a fine special edition for a not-that-fine movie.

But I can't help liking it, for some reason...",1096934400,7,1631,4.634146341463414

And a lot of the characters are really annoying i mean, they make you want to take a gun to your TV annoying!

Luckily Burt finds Jobe and Sarah (actually I lie, coz they found him),the only two children not corrupted by the evil lurking presence of the corn feild. Children of the corn is Stephen King's best. It's got great scare sequences and let me just say that the movie's musical score is a masterpeice in itself. It'd give anyone the chills. So, simply that's why I like this movie.

The movie is actually fairly entertaining until after our two main characers enter the house of our youthful narrator and his sister.  Up until this sour turn in events, it's a fairly noble adaption.  And then the story is wrecked, from the, al I can think of is: ""toned down"" ending, tothe lame interpretation of ""He who walks Behind The rows"".  Why do screenplay writers feel they must always change the master of horror's story around?  Everytime they do it trashes what could've been a promising film.  I've seen it in Dreamcatcher and The Tommyknockers, although this sucked already anyway.  It also brings to mind:  Why did they feel inclined to make a sequel?

THe film is a bit better then the short story itself, but then what else is new? Sure, you get a boring plot that wished it needed more violence since its a horror film, but this film is great the way it is. In my opinion its a great film, but don't expect a lot.

501204,2,6302720419,"This movie has the kind of plot that could scare the pants off you. A teen zealot is contacted by an evil spirit, pieces together a cult in his hometown, convinces his peer group to kill all the adults in town, then carries out murders and sacrifices to appease ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"". I was scared just from the commercials when I was 14. I watched it last night, and it's about as scary as an episode of Friends.
The ""outlanders"" ruin everything. They are so unmoved by the bizarre situation, it's very difficult to be scared yourself. They hit a boy in the road with a Buick LeSabre, the woman is captured by the kids and crucified, the guy is stabbed in the chest, they confront a supernatural entity, witness a sacrifice & subsequent possession, and set acres of cornfields aflame by pushing gasohol through the irrigation pumps. All the while, they barely hit their target heartrate. They're running around town after someone corns up their car (which has the body of the boy in the trunk), constantly encountering horrible situations. Again, they don't even really break a sweat. At the end of the movie, it's like a sequel to that sled dog movie. They're all giddy talking about adopting the two youngsters who help them out. Even then, a psycho from the church springs from their back seat with a knife. After slamming her across the nose with the car door, they just start laughing again and decide to walk to the next town and adopt the kids.
The best actor in this movie is easily the kid who plays Malachai. He's so evil, it's awesome. That red hair, the bellbottom floods, the teeth, and a voice that sounds like barbed wire. He wants the blood of the outlanders, he overthrows Isaac, he carries a kitchen knife in a hip holster. He's who tormented me in my dreams when I was a kid.

They stand around till thier 9-year old leader come to window and gives them  a signal. They kill all the adults. Then the movie comes back to present day and shows 3 kids helping thier sibling try to escape.

But this one is 100% horror movie junkfood entertainment that they just cannot make anymore.  The movie tries to be creepy, but only succeeds some of the time.  The first scene in the diner is still a bit shocking even today.  Unfortunately, the rest of the film never lives up to that scene.  Another highlight is John Franklin's performance as Isaac.

501233,4,6302720419,"In Gaitlan Nebraska three years earlier, it seemed like a nice town until a boy named Issac (John Franklin) who happens to be a young preacher in training was told by a demon posing as god to command him and other children with teens especially Malachai (Courtney Gains) to murder all the adults in town. The town has been nothing but deserted with no adults around for a traveling couple named Vicky (Linda Hamilton) and Burt (Peter Horton) are about to find out the terrifying unholy secret of the killer child cult.

One of the most entertaining and thrilling Stephen King adaptations is a flawed but quite enjoyable supernatural shocker. Based on a short story made by Stephen King, this has gained a cult following plus a legion of sequels and remakes to follow. The acting is OK but Hamilton really shines here in the same year she was in The Terminator but the children here are creepy as hell but it does have a cheap and funny ending though, it's still worth watching.

This Blu-Ray offers a quality high-def picture and sound quality to a 25 year old movie! the extras here are terrific such as trailer with audio commentary, BD-exclusive interviews, featurettes, original storyboard art, fast film facts, original title sequence art and poster-and-still gallery.

Also recommended: ""The Omen"", ""Pet Sematary"", ""The Messengers"", ""Dark Night of the Scarecrow"", ""Let The Right One In"", ""The Wicker Man (1973)"", ""Village of the Damned (1960)"", ""Children of the Damned"" and """,1034208000,,1481,4.916
501234,5,6302720419,"OK. It's silly. I still like this film for it's flaws. Linda Hamilton & Peter Horton are reliable as the adult leads, and I'm usually appalled by bad kid-actors, but there are so many of them that I had a good time. One kid actor, Anne-Marie McEvoy (as Sarah) was believable.  This film starts out well, and really grabs you; after a while, the kids appear and make it a crazy exposition of silliness. The bland setting of Nebraska (actually, filmed in Iowa) adds to the initial interest. Credit must be given to director Fritz Kiersch for his great use of sets and creating a certain tension, and the music of Jonathan Elias (reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's THE OMEN) was effective. Still, there's no forgiving the performances of John Franklin (Isaac) and Courtney Gains (Malachi, who looks like a cross between Alfalfa & Eddie Haskell). They were so atrocious, but, mixed with all the other horrible kid-performances, it becomes a laff-fest. One kid, Amos (John Philbin), looks like a young Tom Cruise, and goes to his death with a toothy smile that's borderline corny (forgive the pun). The film is entertaining, as long as you don't take it seriously. It is based on a 15-page Stephen King story, but it kind of takes on a mystique of its own. The DVD version has a slight LBX which adds to some of the beautiful landscapes. Don't write this off; it's fun.",1034121600,2,1362,4.675
501235,3,6302720419,"Children of the Corn isn't a bad movie, but it is certainly not very scary.  When I was young and this movie was new, my conception of the movie was wrapped in an aura of fright, but now that I have finally watched it, I don't know where that aura came from.  The theme of the movie is nothing new, really, but it has real potential by its very nature.  In Gatlin, Nebraska, there are virtually no adults; the children, led by the young and powerful Isaac with the help of head goon Malachai, murdered all of the adults in the name of religious mania.  He Who Walks Behind the Rows made himself known to Isaac, and that is where all the trouble started three years earlier.  Only two children are not active participants in the twisted religion of Gatlin children-Job and Sarah.  Sara has the ""gift of sight,"" oftentimes revealing future events in her crayon drawings.  Now two strangers have come to town, having run over an already murdered youngster who had tried to escape through the corn fields.  The fate of adults in town is not really a deep secret, but our heroes stumble around idiotically, wising up only when the children have made their move.
John Franklin gives an impressive performance as the young prophet Isaac, adding a real sense of realism this movie had to have in order to work.  Courtney Gains plays his character Malachai very well, but unfortunately the ""farm implement of death""-happy Malachai is one of the most annoying characters in the history of moviemaking.  Our unsuspecting adult ""interlopers"" are OK but not outstanding; Peter Horton gives a credible yet unspectacular performance, and a pre-Terminator Linda Hamilton serves the necessary function of generating sympathy for the grown-ups.  The children Job and Sarah are likeable, but the fact that Job serves as the film's de facto narrator gives a part of the story away fairly early on.
One is left with any number of questions after viewing the film.  Since the murder of the town's adults took place three years prior to the arrival of the interlopers, why do even the youngest kids look exactly the same?  Why do some seem too old to be children to start with?  Who plants all this corn, anyway, and why wouldn't the ill-fated runaway choose to escape during winter, when the corn would presumably be much easier to navigate?  Why are the two adults so slow-witted?  The movie begs many more questions than it answers.  One is also hard pressed to figure out what exactly He Who Walks Behind the Rows really is.  The special effects witnessed at the concluding moments of the movie are unspectacular and unilluminating, and the conclusion does little more than simply bring the movie to a close.  The adults' reactions to events are often inconsistent and seemingly peculiar, at times making the plot sound as weak as it sometimes is.  I won't blame Stephen King for the faults of this film adaptation of his work, particularly given the fact that it takes great liberty with his original short story.  This isn't a movie to avoid, but it basically serves as a diversion rather than a gripping horror story to the would-be viewer.",1033862400,,3124,4.7481481481481485
501236,4,6302720419,"I saw this movie when it came out in '84 and have had some strange connection to it ever since.
What's to like? Well, what has always struck me is how well the children are adapted to the surroundings. I actually BELIEVE that these children lived in Gatlin ""before"" the filming of the movie. They seem very at home and the small town feel is somehow legitimate. The sound is very good for an older flick, being given the 5.1 treatment, and the score itself is practially worth seeing the movie for... I just love that chanting ""Omen-ish"" score, always have. The transfer I'd say is above average, though in places it falters a bit, there is also a handsome insert book that comes with it which is unusual for a rather lowbudget movie. I really like all the leads here, specifically the look on young Sarah's face when ""Vickie"" is taken out to the clearing, she honestly looks to be in fear, I almost feel sorry for the young actress.
What's to hate? Well, aside from the odd smalltown feel there really aren't many chills from a horror movie standpoint. Also, I've never really liked the end, often turning it off b4 the poor CG ending, but hey, this is '84 afterall.
If you have a few dollars and are looking for a somewhat surreal look at small town life, you could do worse than giving Children Of The Corn a look.",1021161600,4,1317,4.423868312757202
501237,1,6302720419,"What a pitiful, feeble attempt to make a horror movie. Where is the horror in this film? Maniacal children sacrificing there own to a demon in the cornfield? HA!! HA!! I laugh at that.
A couple gets lost along the cornfield. While looking at the map they strike a child with their car. They search for help and find out the child was already mangled when they hit him. Peter Horton plays the man(I forget his name) and Linda Hamilton(forget her name too, as the whole movie is forgettable)plays the woman. They meet these two young children who aren't like the others. They let the copule know what is going on. Upon finding this ""vital"" information out, they devise a plan to burn down the corn field. Let's hear it for brilliance!!
The actors give laughable performances, there is no climax, there is no story and there is no point in watching this film. I thought this was a horror film. Where's the scare? Where's the blood? Where's the fright? If you are a horror fan, such as I, please, please stay away from this monstrosity. You'll be entertained more by eating corn then watching Children of the Corn.",1017792000,7,1110,4.582914572864322

To make matters worse this spawned 5-6 sequels. ARGH!!
LEts start with the story.  A young couple on vacation get lost on a side road along a corn field, they accidentally hit a kid along the way, only to find out he was already dead.  They take him to the nearest town, which is deserted and soon are attacked by fanatic cultist that are kids ranging from Infacy all the way to 17 (at 18 you must enter the corn).  They think God lives in the corn (but the average movie goer already knows it's a demon) and thus we set the setting for a complete waste of time.
It gets worse.  This was based of a truely disturbing, yet highly entertaing short story by Stephen King.  This is yet another piece of work completely ruined by Hollywood.  Don't rent or buy this, it's not even worth a penny.",1015459200,3,1024,4.3578947368421055

But like all Grade-B films, it is not meant to.  It is designed for people who like to sit back, munch on chicken wings, and enjoy themselves.
With that in mind, I openly admit liking the movie.  Yes, its missing footage should be added back in, and yes, its ""climatic"" confrontation scene involves one of the most corniest (get it, corniest?  Corny?  Children of the Corn?  I gotta million of 'em!) speeches imaginable, but who cares.

501243,3,6302720419,"Before watching this movie, remember you are going to see an adaptation from a few-pages-long story by Stephen King, performed during the late eighties, when horror movies were the main attraction to young teenagers.
The movie is ridiculous, even if the story is pretty interesting. There are few moments of suspance, but actors aren't really there. It's a kind of a B-movie, with a solid background and incredibly low quality effects.
Anyway, it's interesting to see and to have, as the sign of a very different age.
The DVD is quite well mastered. Images are very noisy because of film grain, but otherwise consistent. Contrast is quite low, and this makes colours a bit washed out.
The sound is a multichannel remix from Chase, encoded in DD 5.1. Anyway dialogues are quite dated and so are the effects. Basses are too boomy and the soundfield collapses too often into the center channel.
The extras are very limited: there's a small booklet and a trailer. That's it.",1004745600,4,970,4.849397590361446

Whichever, by the goofy climax of this wanna-be horror flick, I was feeling more than a little let down. Why is it that so many King adaptations fail so miserably? I can understand the difficulty in translating King's superlative prose into a feature film, but why must the acting be so bad. And why why why does the creepy atmosphere of the story have to be completely destroyed? I'll give you an example: in King's writing, the great creature at the end (He Who Walks Behind the Rows) is a genuinely frightening entity (I won't give away too much). However, in the film, this beast is portrayed as a stupid, hokey ""force"" (probably due to budget restrictions)... I dunno.. maybe I'm taking it all a little too seriously, and if I am I apologize. Still, I'd reccomend seeing the film before you read the story. That way can enjoy it's senseless violence without feeling a longing for King's true ability.",991353600,5,1049,4.675675675675675

If you read the book Night Shift, Children Of The Corn is orgianlly a short story that was written by Stephen King. Of course, the book is completely different from the movie. The movie has a good ending while the book does not. There is features on this film [Amazon.com] just didn't put it in.

My only defense is that these people  didn't try to get ""into"" the film. What the movie lacks in budget  and special effects, is more than made up by a very creepy and chilling  atmosphere. Although the pace of the movie may seem slow, it is actully for  its benefit. If you really try to get into the movie, you begin to  understand how creepy it is that childsren are being possessed. All in all  if you are a horro-genre fan, you have to see it. it is up there with The  Shining, Exorcist, and Nightmare on Elm Street (no joke).
