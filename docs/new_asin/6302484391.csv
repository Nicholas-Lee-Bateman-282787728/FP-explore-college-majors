474626,5,6302484391,"Very funny movie.  What goes wrong, can go wrong and will, for these 3 girls with Marriage on the mind.  And not just any old husband shopping, but a Millionaire.
Classic sexist statements and attitudes, but funny all the same.",995500800,,227,4.65
474627,3,6302484391,Marilyn was quite funny in this film. This is the first time she was in control of her comic ability.,994377600,,101,4.1
474628,1,6302484391,"what a shame for twentieth century fox!  film historically seen this movie was the second made in cinemascope and also done with stereo sound! But there is nothing of it on the tape! Mono-sounded and only 50 % of the  original picture. And often enough the picture was anamorphically pressed,  specially in the beginning, when Alfred Newman conducted the Twentieth  Century-Fox orchestra, only to get the entire orchestra on the 50% TV  picture they have ""pressed"" the original 100% film picture to fit  the TV screen- what a disturbing effect! No star at all for such a  film-video transfer. What a pitty that you can' t get a laserdisc copy  which was available in the correct format 1:2.66 and in the wonderful  stereo sound. 20th Century Fox has to do something about that poor quality  when considering a ""Marilyn Monroe Collection"" on DVD!",962841600,11,845,4.846153846153846
474629,5,6302484391,"This film, remade several times and turned into a short-lived television series starring Barbara Eden, is truly a wonderful film.  Monroe, although she didn't want to wear the glasses required for the part, gives a  wonderful performance as Pola, who, without her glasses, can't see her own  hand in front of her face.  Monroe really proves her comic talent in this  film.
Bacall plays Schatzie, the brains behind the gold-digger plot.  She  is a first in her first major comedy.  In fact, with this film, she opened  up a whole new career for herself.
Grable, in her first non-musical role  in years,  plays, Loco, who brings the men back to the Sutton House  penthouse.  Although she had few comic lines, she played those she did  receive to perfection.  It was the last movie she made under contract with  Twentieth Century Fox after a long starring career beginning in 1940.  In  fact, she only made two more films after this one.
Monroe, who was being  groomed to take Grable's position as top glamour girl of the Twentieth  Century Fox lot, was purposely teamed up with Grable in hopes of fireworks  between the two, which would boost tickey sales.  Studio bosses were  foiled, however, when the two hit it off immediately and became fast  friends who visited each other often and always had a kind word to say  about the other.
All in all, a very enjoyable movie to be watched over  and over again.",951177600,4,1405,4.679012345679013
474630,5,6302484391,"I was unable to understand the sexy and funny plot lines of this movie. This is due to the regrettable absence of the actors' lines upon the screen.  So sad, I saw the whole movie, and never figured out if she  married a millionaire or not.  I love closed captioned movies, and it's  unfortunate that not every single classic movie sold by warehouse internet  companies aren't captioned.  I would buy more classics if they were  captioned.",951177600,,439,4.697368421052632

I love this movie.  Saw it as a child and it informed me in an entertaining way about how people are not always what they seem.  The gals are frauds and so are a number of the men they date.

474753,4,6302484391,"How to Marry a Millionaire, from 1953, is a decent romantic comedy. Three models, Schatze Page (Lauren Bacall), Loco Dempsey (Betty Grable), and Pola Debevoise (Marilyn Monroe), rent a fancy Sutton Place penthouse in New York from Freddie Denmark (David Wayne), a man avoiding the IRS by living in Europe. These three attractive young ladies have a goal set; they hope that living in ""high society"" they will each meet and eventually millionaire husbands (hence the title). Schatze is the husky-voiced leader of the group, Loco is the food-craving spunky one, and Pola is the light-headed ditz whose embarrassed to wear her glasses in front of men. Loco soon meets Tom Brookman (Cameron Mitchell), who takes an immediate interest in Schatze. Believing Tom to be a poor ""gas jockey"", Schatze brushes him off and encourages her friends to do the same. Instead, Schatze sets her sights on J.D. Hanley (William Powell), an aging oil tycoon from Texas. Loco ends up with Waldo Brewster (Fred Clark), a grouch whose exactly married, and Pola falls for J. Stewart Merrill (Alex D'Arcy), an eye-patching wearing mystery man who brags about his wealth. Schatze continues her relationship with J.D. while still refusing Tom's advances, and Pola accepts Stewart's proposal of marriage. Meanwhile, Loco agrees to go with Waldo to his lodge in Maine. However, when she gets there she learns that the place is merely a cabin and not the large membership large she had seen in her mind. While there, Loco falls sick with the measles and she's nursed back to health by Eben (Rory Calhoun), and the two fall in love. Back in NYC, J.D. breaks off his romance Schatze, saying there difference in age would ruin their marriage, and Pola gets on the wrong to go meet Stewart. Pola instead meets Freddie Denmark (the owner of their apartment), who ensures her she's still attractive with her glasses on and the two fall in love. At the end of the movie, Schatze and J.D. have reconciled and are to be married. Pola and Loco show up in time to be her bridesmaids, and they too have married to Freddie and Eben, respectively. However, Schatze fells light-headed at the alter and returns to her room where she and J.D. again end their relationship. Schatze realizes she's in love with Tom. In the final scene, while all three couples are dining at a small diner, Tom pulls out a giant wad of money to pay the check. Unbeknownst to everyone (except the audience), Tom is actually a multi-millionaire and the richest man in NYC. The three women faint upon seeing the money he pulls from his wallet. The End.

How to Marry a Millionaire was the first movie filmed in CinemaScope, but the second released, after The Robe. It's synopsis came from a duo of stage plays from the early 1900s, but there was considerably more glamour added to the movie. The three female leads were meant for their roles. Marilyn Monroe, who was quickly becoming the biggest star in America, plays Pola with charm and grace. Even though the part is basically a one-note dumb blonde, she manages to add a certain sincerity and vulnerability that couldn't have been in the script. Betty Grable, the great pin-up of the 1940s, does justice to Loco. Always known for being spunky and a bit goofy, Grable possesses both of these characteristics in Loco, but there's something more there... like Monroe, she gives it sincerity. Lauren Bacall, who gets third billing but who's arguably playing the lead, lets her before-hidden comedy skills shine as Schatze. Her sharp-tongued wit and sophistication give her a certain humanity that's very appealing. As for the gentlemen callers... well, William Powell is charming as J.D. as is Rory Calhoun as Eben; Fred Clark is a bit annoying as Waldo, Cameron Mitchell is a good addition as Tom; and Alex D'Arcy... well, quite honestly, he's not on screen long enough to judge whether he's good or bad.

With all the movie's good points, that isn't to say How to Marry a Millionaire doesn't have drawbacks. First, when the three girls take Freddie's apartment, they immediately take to selling his things. How can they do that? Are the things really Freddie's, or what? It's never addressed. The plot is a bit unbalanced, too. As I said above, Lauren Bacall as by most accounts the star of this movie. Her character, Schatze, gets more screen time over Monroe's Pola and Grable's Loco, and the majority of the in-depth characterization involves Schatze and J.D. in their scenes alone together. Pola and Loco just suddenly fall in love with Freddie and Eben, respectively, and there's not really that much of mentioning as to why. These are the little things that bothered me about the movie, but over all, I liked it. The perfect casting is certainly worth the purchase of the DVD, and like many movies, the acting is better than the script. All three of the ladies are funny, but in their own way. Recommended.",1450310400,,4892,4.822619047619048

474825,4,6302484391,"HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE was the first-ever Cinemascope/stereo sound comedy, and the first such extravaganza on broadcast TV. In 1961, ""Milionaire"" was the premiere film on NBC's brand new ""Saturday Night at the Movies"" series.

In this amalgam of two Broadway shows, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Greeks-Had-a-Word-For-Them/dp/B000R9COGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Greeks Had a Word For Them</a>"" and ""Loco,"" the trio of Bacall, Grable and Monroe portray golddigging gals who aggressively target wealthy men. At the end, they all wed guys as poor as they are, or so it seems.

It's frothy '50s stuff that's hampered at times by the censorship of that era. Example: Monroe must say ""Men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses"" instead of ""don't make passes at."" There's still room for some zingers, such as Bacall's old age barb aimed right at husband Humphrey Bogart: ""Look at Roosevelt, look at Churchill, look at old fella whats-his-name in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-AFRICAN-QUEEN/dp/B002TOL4QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE AFRICAN QUEEN</a>.

474828,4,6302484391,"This is remarkably seamless.

  Such a fine thing, whatever your walk, to leave off thinking for a
  couple of hours. To have the modern world, stretched wide, colorfully,
  on a two-dimensionsal canvas, between wars. If ever such a time. The
  Korean one had probably just ended, as would soon the First Indochina
  War. There is no hint of such things. Models model the latest fashions
  for us, explicitly in one scene, but in fact throughout the movie.
  Impeccable style. One guy carries around a golf club everywhere.

  The only notion of squalor or possibly troubled sleep (but only the
  slightest) appears as a dent on the fender of the car that drives
  Grable into the mountains, to a sort of ski vacation. It's put there
  intentionally as a bit of benign foreshadowing, a little piece of evidence
  for the storyline; not to provoke thought about the world outside the bubble.

  It's bookended by small orchestral pieces. Something rather rhapsodic plays,
  to get and keep us in the mood, until back in the streets. Nothing is ever
  explained in the film. Things just happen, and then move on. A wonderful
  economy of story telling, it never gets bogged down in the least. It is
  genuinely clever and funny (expensive furnishings keep diseapearing, then
  bought back, and then resold) and beautiful looking.

  If you judge a film by how well it achieves what it has set out to achieve
  then this gets top honors.

  Despite the quest for millions, it ends with burgers and beers and the
  3 newlyweds out on the diner floor.

474941,4,6302484391,"Pola (Marilyn Monroe), Schatze (Lauren Bacall) and Loco (Betty Grable), three New York fashion models, have a ""creamy"" plan -- take a lease on a posh Sutton Place apartment and use it as a ""bear trap"" -- a place to catch millionaires.  Things turn funny, though, when one rich man turns out to be unobtainable, another one poorer than supposed, and a third quite unfairly appraised until the movie's very end.  While not one of the tip-top movie comedies of its era, HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE has numerous compensating charms, such as the show-off appeal of early CinemaScope (Fox's first comedy in the new widescreen process), an excellent supporting cast including William Powell, David Wayne and Fred Clark, and of course three of screendom's most desirable dames in a buddy picture with class.  Movie is preceded by a musical short, ""Street Scene,"" designed to highlight that wide, wide screen.  A very desirable flick, often combined with other Marilyn Monroe movies in various and sundry package deals.

Trivia Note:  In Germany, the title was translated ""Wie Angelt Man Sich Einen Millionaer,"" literally ""How to LAND a Millionaire,"" as one would a fish.",1413417600,,1161,5.020833333333333

474963,4,6302484391,"This 1953 Technicolor (first ever!) piece of fluff is amusing in its sixty-year-old silliness.  It is a remake of a 1933 B/W film, ""The Greeks had a word for Them"".  Using Lauren Bacall and Marilyn Monroe in leading roles, the film has some eternal appeal for showing the high life of 1950's Manhattan and beautiful costumes, witty lines, and desperate maneuvers of the working class.

 Women are portrayed as clever and conniving and willing to listen to any nonsense from any man, so long as he's loaded.  The wealthy men they pursue are portrayed as well-dressed, old (in their 50's and up), burnt out and rather dopey - falling for any woman who's young and good-looking.  They simper and smile and put on fancy dresses with makeup and hairdos and high-heels for the nightlife world.

The men they seek (i.e. their wallets) fall in line and the women grab what they can get:  they're from the working class and work as models or as extras in plays.  Their goal:  never work again, no matter what it takes.

Yes, the Greeks had a word for them:  ""Golddiggers"".  Think they're not all around us right this minute?  Check out the Net!

BUt what makes these particular white 1950's beauties more amusing than most of the connivers around us now -- they are witty and charming and clearly in control in a very funny way.  Even Marilyn Monroe, ever cast as a dopehead, looks and acts sharper than one would assume such an ""airhead"" or ""dingbat"" with dyed blonde hair ought to.  Her banging into doors and people - due to her refusal to wear glasses since men won't make passes at such bespectacled lasses - made me laugh.  It is so put on, how can you not laugh?  Contacts were yet to come!  In Italy, women and men alike buy expensive-looking no-prescription lenses just to look smarter and more attractive, and name brands spring up just for such a need.  Knock-offs from China follow.  I digress.  Marilyn Monroe looked wonderful in her cat's eyes glasses and should have worn them more in her real life.  She looks more ""educated Scandanavian"" type, what might really attract a higher-level man of the world.

1950's USA was still full of housewives but also millions of working women in the big cities.  NYC was a city bustling with offices, shops, restaurants and subway trains and all packed with women trying to earn money in an unfair job world.  A good gig like modeling was the best most working class women could aim for - either that or filing in a dopey office, yearning for real life to begin.

If life is different now, it is not because the men gave in and ceded a lot of the job openings to women.  There has been a whole women's movement resulting in legislation forcing all these things out and into the open.  That is why a film like this, looking back on a whole way of life with women trapped in low pay and subservience, is instructive at the same time that it is amusing to see the wealthy alter krappers hoodwinked.  And even the cowboy/herd-rich oil man is no sucker in the end, since at 56, he has learned that life is full of disappointments and can stand yet another one - Lauren Bacall standing him up at the altar, so to speak.

Women still dream of marriage for identity and meal tickets.  Girls dream on.  They still  rank their lives according to the man's paycheck and inheritance, but it is nowhere so extreme as in these 1950's films.

In spite of all this grim analysis, I admit that I enjoyed the hanky-panky these smart gals set up by faking their class level and getting fatcats to pour money, furs and marriage proposals on them.  Gotta look rich to get a rich guy, n'est-ce pas?

If in the end, they got normal fellows whom they really loved, well, isn't this Hollywood anyway?

What the men in the audience are thinking, I don't know.  Are they offended that the men are such dopes, or that men have to get so old and so rich before anyone beautiful will even listen to them at all?  The married man who takes one lady up to his snowbound lodge in Maine had SEVEN women back at his house - in-laws and so on - and was a beleaguered, desperate man.  His fate really made me laugh!  Classic mess on the George Washington Bridge, which he'd taken to avoid anyone seeing him.",1410825600,,4214,4.489473684210527

In this amalgam of two Broadway shows, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Greeks-Had-a-Word-For-Them/dp/B000R9COGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Greeks Had a Word For Them</a>"" and ""Loco,"" the trio of Bacall, Grable and Monroe portray golddigging gals who aggressively target wealthy men. At the end, they all wed guys as poor as they are, or so it seems.

It's frothy '50s stuff that's hampered at times by the censorship of that era. Example: Monroe must say ""Men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses"" instead of ""don't make passes at."" There's still room for some zingers, such as Bacall's old age barb aimed right at husband Humphrey Bogart: ""Look at Roosevelt, look at Churchill, look at old fella whats-his-name in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-AFRICAN-QUEEN/dp/B002TOL4QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE AFRICAN QUEEN</a>.

While not an expert, it is relatively easy to put this picture into historical perspective and importance.

The film itself is quite pleasant, by the way, a light comedy with hints of social critic. It opens with a delightful orchestral overture, a demo for stereo sounds behind the CinemaScope screen. It is also a reminder why we were involved in this hobby in the first place.

I chose the one where she is wearing a purple dress (and the picture even showed up on my order confirmation form so I expected to receive that specific one). I ended up getting the other cover version. I was not really upset because it really is not a big deal, but it wasn't what I expected so I was more confused and disappointed than upset. I decided to e-mail the sender of the product just to see if there was some way of fixing the mistake.

Blu-Ray is causing many of these films to be reissued in wide screen close to the original format, if not dead on.  Some problems with the image due to the state of the art at that time, but it is a fine version, and very enjoyable.

Marilyn Monroe is truly amazing as a first-class comedienne, with both dialogue as well as physical comedy.. Each of the three actresses have their own small bit that references their real lives, which brings on a laugh or two. Betty Grable thinks she hears Harry James (her real life husband) on the radio. Lauren Bacall talks about ""that guy in 'African Queen'"" (refering to her real life husband Humphrey Bogart). And while in a fashion show, Marilyn Monroe is seen in a bathing suit with accents of diamonds, which the commentor makes reference to by saying ""we all know 'diamonds are a girl's best friend'"" (of course bringing to mind Marilyn's big break-out film, ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""). The supporting male performers hold their own very well, especially William Powell and, in a smaller but very funny role, Fred Clark. My one complaint is with the blue-ray disc, not the film itself. The true scope of the film is not shown, There are a few scenes where the sides of the frame are noticeably ""squeezed in"". It's like the 255:1 ratio (stated on the packaging) was crammed into a 235:1 frame. Why do that? If you're going to release a film in high quality blue-ray, then do so with it's true full scope.

Fox came up with an idea to save ITS skin: they cast the new fame Monroe and the old fame Grable in a romantic comedy spectacular ""How to Marry a Millionaire"". To give the film an extra sparkle, Grable garners top billing, Monroe second, and other co-star Lauren Bacall receives thrid. Ironicaly, Bacall is truthfully playing the lead role. The movie recieves a three star from me because there isn't enough of Miss Monroe. I enjoy Miss Grable's performances (and others as well in other films), but I'm not to crazy about Bacall. Her husky, deep, and somewhat manish look about her makes her unattractive to me. Fox could've cast someone else in this movie with Monroe and Grable, like Lana Turner, Ava Gardner, Linda Darnell, or maybe even Susan Hayward. I guess if you like romantic comedies, this would be the one to see; however, don't go searching for much Monroe/Grable screen time.",1346457600,2,1045,4.909604519774011

Marilyn was quite funny playing a ""blind-as-a-bat"" girl without her glasses. As the title suggests, the film is about three woman who rent an apartment together with a scheme to marry a millionaire. What happens to each girl during their plan is both hillarious and sweet. The ending was as cute as you could expect.

The only thing that prevented me from giving this movie 5 stars, is the long winded introduction. The film opens with a full orchestra on stage performing a number for the first 6 minutes of the movie. When the song finally ends, the conductor turns around for a quick bow, then starts another song! At that point I actually said out loud, ""you've gotta be kidding me!""

The movie begins with a view of midtown Manhattan (Rockefeller Center, Central Park). A woman looks at an apartment. It is very big and spacious. The owner had to leave the country fast! Mrs. Page take it for a year. ""Bingo."" Another woman arrives; she doesn't wear glasses. ""Is she class?"" She knows how to get value for money. We see more scenes of Manhattan. Mrs. Page explains her philosophy in men. They need the right bait. They dream about a rich man. A man telephones for a dinner date and is turned down. Can they find a marriageable rich man? A man from Dallas tells about his stock and invites them to a dinner. [Note his accent.] Paula doesn't wear glasses. The conversation tells about their character. [Is their talk funny?]

Paula has a dream about getting jewelry. Mr. Handley inspects the model wearing fashions. [This tells about the fashions of that era. Do these fashions seem both outdated and funny?] We see a steam train traveling in a snowy country. They arrive at the lodge. ""This house?"" Miss Dempsey complains about the snow. They get music on the radio. Harry James? No. They take her temperature then get help for her. Measles. [No vaccine in those days.] The owner of that apartment returns to search for something. Mrs. Page returns with her date. Jamie asks about the lack of furniture, and tells his age. He is a realist. Paula has a boyfriend who will take her to Atlantic City. Will Miss Dempsey find love in Maine? Poor families do not have wealth to leave to their children. Miss Dempsey learns about timber. The owner of that apartment returns again to retrieve a letter. We see Laguardia airport and a four-engine Constellation airliner.

Paula talks to her fellow passenger about wearing glasses. ""You look better with them on."" [She also sees better.] Did Paula take the wrong flight? Did Miss Dempsey also make a mistake? Jamie explains how smart he is in covering his tracks. Is it lucky to be the 50 millionth car over the George Washington bridge? Mrs. Page sells the piano again. Does money always bring happiness? ""I never want to see you again."" Mrs. Page will marry the man from Dallas. Paula married Freddie in Kansas City. There is a snag in the wedding plans. Mrs. Page loves a younger man. They all dine at a small restaurant, then are shocked when J.D. pays with a $1000 bill. They all faint!

This movie tells about culture in the early 1950s, as seen by Hollywood. Was it taken from a stage play? The 1930s movie ""Three Broadway Girls"" had a similar story about a search for husbands. The references and jokes are no longer funny or relevant. Was the story modified for this movie? You can get hints from an alternate reality when a woman arranges dates for other women. But it all ends in happy matrimony. I wonder what will happen in a few years? The movie ""Niagara"" was made around the same time.",1334016000,,2894,4.602713178294573

It certainly will never get confused as a Pulitzer contender but taken as it is - a time capsule snapshot of late 40's/ early 50's America and the American Dream - it is quite accurate, on point, and down right funny.

The three women work wonderfully well together.  Grable was the 20th Century Fox star; Bacall had the panache; Monroe was the up and coming one that everybody was talking about - and what should have turned into a diva-fight mess resulted in a laugh filled movie.

The whole concept is dated but let's face it - we are talking about a movie made 60 years ago!  People have all dutifully noted that (and the slap it gives to women's lib) but no one has recorded that the movie is fun - pure, plain and simple.  Some of the lines are witty and there are enough inside jokes to make it an instant classic.

Watch it with an open mind and don't look for deep messages - just have fun with it - the cast certainly did and that is what makes this an enjoyable film.",1207267200,,1133,4.311320754716981

Marilyn Monroe is at her ditsiest with a severe vision problem that she won't correct by wearing her glasses. Betty Grable is sweet but a little too slick for her own good. And Lauren Bacall is shiny, sassy, and just as smart as always. All the ladies are looking for love but their only criteria is that the man must have money. The usual mayhem ensues with some notable performances by the ladies. My favorite is the scene where Betty is coming back with her friend from the mountains and he is trying to cover up the fact that he is not with his wife by taking a different route. They go over the bridge and well . . . watch how Betty makes the evening edition with a man trying desperately to hide. Marilyn picks a tricky guy trying to take advantage of her while the man she ultimately falls for David Wayne tries to figure out how someone else is living in his apartment. William Powell from Thin Man fame has a role as the suitor that Lauren Bacall is interested in. Both of them know that this is all about the money but Mr. Powell plays the gentlemen with great care even when it costs him what he wants. Funny movie with lots of sly, quick jabs and some scenes that are so well crafted that you remember them long after the movie ends.",1190937600,,1351,4.260700389105058
475240,3,6302484391,"First of all, this movie is still hysterical.  It is a work of art.  Although Marilyn got top billing, she's clearly out-performed by both Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable.

Let me, for a brief moment talk about the ""Diamond Collection"" version of How To Marry A Millionaire.  When you think of remastering, especially older films made on Cineascope or Technicolor, you think of rich, vibrant-colored stories in particular the Rogers and Hammerstein collection.  Excellent.  You, especially, think of the remastered Disney Collection.  Excellent.  Both of which, were competing genres at the time Marilyn was making a name for herself.  You might even throw the remastered ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1937) in the fray.  And yet, this ""Diamond Collection"" is barely passable as a DVD version.  This isn't a distinct restoration.  The images, even in the special feature section ""Restoration Comparison"" shows how little the previous version and the film version hasn't had much improvement with this collection.  Don't get me wrong, the sound reproduction is superb, but this is comedy and a lot depends on visuals.

Recently, I started to repurchase the Disney collection-- their ""Platinum 2-disc"" set.  Cinderella, Peter Pan.  And, there is a profound difference between the last version and this deluxe version.  The Sound of Music, the same thing.

This isn't to say, it's not worth watching, but there's little to no improvement in picture quality.  And, that's too bad, the technology is already here and their apology for ""grainy film loss"" is no excuse for not investing in a better color transfer system.",1188172800,6,1603,5.167315175097277
475241,5,6302484391,"I enjoyed this movie. This is where I first discovered Lauren Bacall, and it made me a fan. Even though I am a HUGE fan of Marilyn, I still was very interested in Lauren, so that should tell you something about her performance in this. Lauren's character is bold, blunt, sulky, and serious, while still remaining funny. Lauren, MM, and Betty Grable are simply three models on the prowl for a very rich husband. Bacall is the one who is most serious & really wants a millionaire. Grable is funny & very daffy in it. She is just on the brink of slow, stupid, & dumb. She gave a good performance. MM is half-blind & is her usual innocent, breathy self. I do feel that the film treated her as 3rd in importance. I wanted more scenes of her. I personally don't consider this her best or my favorite performance/character, bcz as I said there doesn't seem to be so much focus on her, but she is still watchable. I also liked the movie bcz you get to see what a swanky apartment in '50's NY looks like- and in my opinion, (as the girls would say) ""It's just creamy!"" (Creamy means very good). And you see how a fashion show was in the '50's. This is a funny movie mixed with good performances, and great one-liners from Bacall's character (If you don't marry the man, you haven't caught him, he's caught you). I definitely recommend it.",1188172800,,1329,4.384615384615385

Bacall has great timing and delivery as well as some of the best lines (e.g., ""he's a character straight from characterville"" or when asked if she thinks having money will automatically make you happy she replies, ""no, but it doesn't automatically depress me either."") Marilyn is an absolute hoot especially in regard to her reluctance to wear glasses, because ""men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses,"" as if that could ever apply to her!  Grable is equally charming as a naive model who travels to a ""lodge"" with a married man because she has fond memories of an Elks Convention. It's all good, clean, fun with a clever little wrap up at the end.  A definite keeper!",1186617600,,735,4.71875
475254,3,6302484391,"The name of an outfit modeled in the film's fashion show sequence, my title might be the best way of explaining 20th-Century Fox's attitude towards this famous 1953 picture, the first ever made (though the second actually released) in CinemaScope. The film begins (for reasons never explicitly explained) with the head of Fox's music department, Alfred Newman, conducting his celebrated orchestral suite ""Street Scene"" to show off the screen aspect size and the sound quality of this new film process; then the rest of the film takes full advantage of the new screen size to show off the fashions of and the beautiful Sutton place apartment rented by Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, and Marilyn Monroe in their quest to marry rich men. We are also treated to enormous vistas of the pine-strewn winter slopes of Maine, the George Washington Bridge, the Queen Mary, and a TWA airliner taking off for reasons that have little to do with the intrinsic logic of the story, which doesn't make much sense anyway. It's best to enjoy this film as a product of its time than as a sophisticated comedy of the sexes. Monroe is very funny as the nearsighted Pola; her bumping into walls and furniture shouldn't be so funny as often as it is but she makes it work every time. Betty Grable is also very likable and charming, although she's  probably a little too old for her role as Loco, the earthiest of the trio. Lauren Bacall, however, drains all humor and charm out of the part of Schatze Page, the most determined of the three women. Constantly barking out commands and snarling at suitors, she seems to be auditioning for the role of Pope Julius II in THE AGONY AND THE ECSTACY. It seems impossible to understand what the zillionaire disguised as a gas pump jockey (Cameron Mitchell) who doggedly pursues her might see in her--although she does look her best in the swank New Look gowns of Travilla. With David Wayne, unfunny as a tax evader; William Powell, lovable as ever as a kind Dallas cattleman; and the overripely handsome Rory Calhoun as a forest ranger.",1185580800,,2052,4.7478991596638656

The main attraction of the movie are; Schatze Page (Lauren Bacall), Pola Debevoise (Marilyn Monroe), and Loco Dempsey (Betty Grable). This romantic comedy is set in Manhattan about three women who team up with an elaborate scheme to lure wealthy men with an intention to marry them. They rent a penthouse, sell the furniture that doesn't belong to them, and use the funds to support themselves. Schatze is the team leader who is smart and all brains; other two are ditsy blondes. Schatze has her eyes set on an elderly, charming and wealthy widower J.D. Hanley (William Powell), at the same time ignores the advances of a young man by the name of Tom Brookman (Cameron Mitchell) whom she thinks is a poor ""gas pump jockey."" The three ladies meet men of their dreams; the gold digger's plans go awry when the two blondes fall in love with men who are poor, and they desperately try to stop each other from marrying the wrong men. At the end the two blondes end up marrying these men in the name of love. Schatze hits the jackpot; when Hanley offers to marry her; she has a change of heart, and she finds that she will be marrying Tom who is not poor as she always suspected, but a millionaire. Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe, and Betty Grable deliver the best performances of their careers as ""desperate women,"" but Lauren Bacall is a clincher, and most impressive in the number one spot. This movie was directed by Jean Negulesco, who also directed movies such as, Johnny Belinda (1948), Best of Everything (1959), Titanic (1953), and The Rains of Ranchipur (1955).

The number Alfred Newman conducts had been used as the title theme for the Oscar-winning movie ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" a half-decade earlier. While the plots of the two films are light years apart, the title of the earlier one (which had to do with anti-Semitism) addresses one of the final plot twists in ""How To Marry..."" In essence, the orchestra's opening performance represents a droll set-up to this delightful movie's windup, but so subtly that only Hollywood insiders would be aware of what was being done.

Funniest bit in the movie: a very lecherous Fred Clark foiled by a bridge tolltaker.

This was the first comedy filmed in Cinemascope.  To emphasize the Cinemascope aspect, the film opens with a symphony orchestra playing Street Scene.  This is followed by various shots of NYC.

The film starts with Mrs. ""Shotzy"" Page (Lauren Bacall) going to look at a flat.  But is she there to rent the apartment or is she there to meet the owner?  Well, the owner has flown the country due to tax difficulties.  She rents the flat with her friend Paula (Marilyn Monroe).  Paula has a friend to be the third roommate, Miss ""Loco"" Dempsey (Betty Grable) who picks up men while shopping.

Shotzy has a plan, the best way to meet millionaires is to be in their circles.  The only problem is Loco keeps bringing losers home.  Take for example Tom, the first guy Loco brings back.  Shotzy immediately knows he's a loser, he doesn't wear a tie.

The girls pay their expenses by selling the furniture - it's nice having a tax exile for a landlord.  And they need the money, its been three months and the only bite any of the girls have is Tom chasing Shotzy.  But Loco finally hits pay dirt at Bergdorf's.  She brings home JD Handley (William Powell) from Dallas, Texas as in cattle.  He invites the girls to the Oil Institute's Ball.

Shotzy winds up with JD.  Paula finds a Saudi oil man, Stuart. And Loco finds a married banker Mr. Brewster.

Loco goes off for the weekend to Maine with Brewster thinking she is attending a lodge convention but its his hunting lodge.  She gets measles and is quarantined.

While back in NYC, Freddie Dinmore (David Wayne) has snuck back from tax exile to get some papers out of the safe.  JD tells Shotzy that he is leaving.  But she tells him that she likes older men, ""you know like that old guy in The African Queen.""

Back in Maine, Loco is fine but now Brewster is sick.  She falls for the ranger Evan (Rory Calhoun).  She thinks when he tells her, ""all this is mine"", that he owns the forest, not that he watches over it.

Freddie returns to the apartment and once again runs into Paula, who thinks he's Shotzy's friend.  Paula goes to Atlantic City to meet Stuart's mother.  On the airplane who sits next to her, Freddie!

Alone, Shotzy finally agrees to have dinner with Tom. And again and again but JD reappears and asks her to marry him.  Shotzy's dreams have come true.  At the wedding, Loco announces that she married Evan, the ranger.  Then Paula arrives and announces she married Freddie.  Shotzy gets to the alter, only to realize that she cannot marry for money and runs off with Tom.  It's only after all that, he lets her know how rich he is.

475296,3,6302484391,"This is a fun movie, but if you have a regular size tv, I don't recommend buying the dvd.  I normally like letter box viewing, but this was the second Cinemascope movie made, and the director shot almost 80% of it (or more?) in medium long shot.  So every shot shows the actors from the top of their heads down to mid-calf, usually clumped in the middle two-thirds of the shot, with lots of extra space on the far sides of the screen, filled with such interesting things as furniture and curtains.  Close ups are rare, as are mid shots.  It's like the director, faced with the new screen shape, shot it like a play viewed from the 22nd row.  If you have a regular size tv, it means you can barely see the talented actress's faces.  This is one of the times it's too bad that the dvd wasn't released (as some used to be) with BOTH widescreen and the ""pan and scan"", formatted-for-tv versions.  Normally I way prefer the letter box -- but this movie is pretty hard to watch that way.  So that's my warning.  The movie itself is commercial fluff, but Lauren Bacall is a lot of fun in her smart, edgy mode; and this was Marilyn Monroe's break-through year, with this charming, funny performance, and also ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (which is not in Cinemascope and looks just great on dvd).

P.S. Well a year or so later, I relented and bought the movie anyway, because Monroe and Bacall are so likable in it.  And what I say is still true that its use of the camera is very monotonous, not enough close ups or mid shots.  But once you accept that, it's still a fun, commercial movie.",1093478400,11,1580,4.373287671232877

We can only hope that these women got big bucks for starring in this mindless comedy. Monroe and Grable in much of the movie appear to be in a contest to see who can do or say the dumbest things. Ms. Bacall has a modicum of intelligence although she's no candidate for membership in Mensa International. On the other hand, if you accomplish what you are seeking, or some variation thereof, who's to say that you're dumb after all.

 There are some funny moments in this bit of fluff. Ms. Grable mistakes a trumpet player she hears on the radio for Harry James. (For those of you whose first live president you remember was Ronald Reagan, Ms. Grable was married to Mr. James for many years.) Also, Me. Bacall makes a quip about the ""old"" man who starred in ""The African Queen""; i.e., Humphrey Bogart. And Ms. Monroe, too vain to wear eyeglasses, just keeps running into walls.

 Did women really dress this way in the 50's? I believe they did. You will laugh out loud at the costumes, from the one-piece swimsuits--the Miss America pageant has nothing on these gals-- to the dyed to match outfits to the skirts so full that they could serve as flotation devices should these women get into deep water.

Though the story and humor are extremely dated and so many of its stars are now dead, the photography and sound are both so breathtakingly clear and beautiful, it makes one realize how advanced the technical side of filmmaking was that long ago.  It's amazing how cinematographers of that day were able to adapt so quickly to the much wider screen and take full advantage of its sweep even during scenes filmed in close quarters, such as those on the airliner (which was a propeller plane, by the way). It's true that Lauren Bacall, though lovely in the film, looks much older than the ""25"" she's supposed to be.  (I saw Ms. Bacall in person pitching her bio at a bookstore 45 years later and she looked un-surgically young and beautiful, so go figure.)

475302,4,6302484391,"Set mostly in the urban jungle of New York, How To Marry A Millionaire was Marilyn Monroe's 20th film, and despite her sharing starring roles with veterans Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable, she evolved more compared to her previous hit, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.
Schotzie Page (Bacall), Pola Debevoise (Monroe), and Loco Dempsey (Grable) are three models who live in an expensive penthouse apartment.  Their master plan, engineered by Schotzie, is to snag classy-looking people who wear neckties and to get nobody under six figures a year.  The apartment is to keep up appearances.  Appearances?  Within three months, DISappearances is what happens, especially to the furniture.
The men they meet are a mixed bag.  Tom Brookman likes Schotzie, but with the way he dresses, which isn't that bad, she thinks he's a common gas pump jockey.  J.D. Handley is a middle-aged widowed Texan millionaire who's charming and polite in a smooth but humble way.  Schotzie falls for him.  Waldo Brewster is an uptight square who's married and complains about his family, but that doesn't stop him from snagging Loco.  The two deserve each other, as he bellyaches while she whines.  Pola ends up with J. Stewart Merrill, who's quite the fashion victim with that jewelled eyepatch of his.
The fashion show segment is a highlight, seeing the fashions of the 1950's.  Of the three, Pola's red outfit is striking.  And of the dreams the three have, Loco's is the funniest compared to the other two's.
As for the women trio, Lauren Bacall (Schotzie), Marilyn Monroe (Pola), and Betty Grable (Loco) do well, though Bacall is the character we see struggling to overcome her pride and thus the most interesting one.  Monroe plays the nearsighted Pola with laughs, as we see her bumping into things when she refuses to wear her glasses in front of men.  She's the most lovable of the three.  In fact, her scene with David Wayne aboard the plane is my favourite in the whole movie.  And actually, she does look cool with glasses.
Speaking of which, this was Wayne's fourth and last film with Monroe.  He plays Freddie Denmark, the owner of the apartment the trio are living in.  Two other stars deserve honorable mention.  It's quite a sight to see the 50's blonde beauty queen starring opposite her predecessor of the 1940's, Betty Grable, who in a modelling sequence, briefly strikes a pose reminiscent of her famous pinup.  And William Powell (Handley) in his penultimate film plays his role with a quiet dignity of a man in his years looking for emotional fulfillment.
A film injoke occurs when Schotzie says she likes older men, listing Roosevelt, Churchill, and ""whatsisname in African Queen""  The joke is that Lauren Bacall IS married to Humphrey Bogart.  Another is when Loco hears the radio and thinks Harry James is playing.  James was of course Betty Grable's husband at the time.
There are two Movietone newsreels here, one for the premiere of this movie, the other for the sneak preview of The Seven Year Itch.
This remake of The Greeks Had A Word For Them was the second movie filmed in CinemaScope, the new 2.35:1 widescreen process pioneered by Henri Chretien, the first one being The Robe.  Hopefully, Chretien got to see this movie before his death in 1956.  The opening number ""Street Scene"" is a six-minute orchestral prelude that served no other purpose than to show off stereophonic sound.
This is a slightly better gold-digging manhunter movie than Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, as the message comes through that money doesn't necessarily buy you happiness, even though it doesn't automatically depress one either.  However, Handley says it best when he says ""there's only one cure for loneliness--human companionship.""",1063411200,6,3710,4.982142857142857
475313,3,6302484391,"Great actresses... Great plot idea... So what went wrong?
I was certain I would love this movie but I felt very disappointed after watching it. It was very predictable but that wouldn't truly destroy a light-hearted movie like this. Although gags such as Marilyn Monroe's character's refusal to wear her glasses in public were entertaining, overall the movie wasn't very funny, even in comparison to other movies of its time.

The movie starts off at a moderate pace as the women decide to catch a millionare. Then the movie speeds through the chase. You see very little relationship development. What really destroyed it was the sudden, abrupt ending. The distribution of screen time was uneven; Two of the girls suddenly show up married at the end of the movie without much leading up to their ultimate decisions while Lauren Bacall's character is seen during all her decisionmaking.
The movie, all in all, is cute. The actresses still give a great performance (although I found Betty Grable's character somewhat irritating) despite the script's flaws. It is a light-hearted movie that will make you smile when you are not in the mood for a drama or in-depth plot.

475314,5,6302484391,"How to Marry a Millionaire made a pretty big splash when it was released in 1953.  Not only was this the first comedy to be filmed in widescreen CinemaScope, it pooled the talents of three of Hollywood's most famous actresses: Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall, and Marilyn Monroe.  In a sense, this film represents the passing of the sex symbol baton from Grable to the up and coming Monroe.  Personally, Betty Grable has never struck me as attractive at all, and Lauren Bacall, while possessed of a classic beauty, has never looked young in her life, yet they have a screen presence that Marilyn, as striking as she is in this picture, doesn't yet quite possess.  This film is probably not very high on the favorite movies lists of feminists, as it revolves around each of the main characters trying to snag a rich husband, but it is really just good, clean comedy that, in the end, shows that money is certainly not everything.
Schatze Page (Bacall) is the brains behind this covert operation, leasing a swanky apartment in New York to serve as the base of operations from which she and her two friends can lure rich men.  Of course, the refrigerator is always bare and there is nowhere to sit because all of the furniture has been sold, but the girls make do.  Loco Dempsey (Grable) has a knack for getting poor men to help her along in life, but eventually the trio receives an invitation to a little get-together of oil men, at which point each meets an eligible fellow.  As you might expect, the best-laid plans of mice and women fray around the edges, and the magic of true love enters the equation in a most decided fashion.  Marilyn gives a memorable performance as Pola Debevoise, a young lady so worried that her eyeglasses make her unattractive that she stumbles and bumbles her way through scene after scene as blind as a bat.  As David Wayne's character Freddie Denmark informs her, though, she is the last person on earth one would associate with the image of an old maid.  Truer words have never been spoken.  There's a surprise or two toward the end, of course, but it's nothing the audience is not aware of from the very start.
There are plenty of reasons for watching this well-made comedy, not the least of which is the fact that it marks Marilyn's imminent jump from popular Hollywood newcomer to legendary goddess of cinema.  The acting is top-notch, the comedy is light-hearted and fun, and the combination of three stars of this magnitude in the same movie is a rare treat indeed; plus, the film offers Marilyn in both widescreen and gorgeous color.",1057795200,,2568,4.644591611479028

475317,5,6302484391,"And so we follow the escapades of three models as they take a luxury apartment together in the hopes of snaring a rich husband in this delightful comedy starring Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, and then-newcomer Marilyn Monroe.
Bacall is the ringleader, the level-headed woman who seems as tough as nails. Seems she got burned once years before with a poor guy, and she's not letting that happen again, no siree. The other ladies, Grable and Monroe, don't have quite her hard-nosed ambition, so there's lots to laugh at as Grable digs more working class fellas and near-sighted but not wearing her glasses Monroe can never quite tell who she's talking to. All three women have great wardrobes and as they're models in the storyline, there's even an opportunity to have a mini-fashion show with ensembles that otherwise wouldn't fit into the plot.
The supporting cast is solid too, with exceptional work from the married man who thinks he can have an illicit liaison with Grable, and the always wonderful William Powell as the silver fox older man Bacall is trying to lasso for herself, stubbornly refusing the advances of loutish seeming Cameron Mitchell. Of course, if I were in this movie, I wouldn't have to convince myself to go with Powell! But I guess I'll have to console myself with the millionaires in my own life instead. David Wayne does one of his better jobs as a four-eyed millionaire on the lam who finds himself sitting next to Monroe on a plane bound for -- but that's part of the gag!
I really enjoy myself every time I watch ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" as every gal winds up following her heart anyway to a satisfactory conclusion. It's certainly ""How to"" have a good time with the telly tonight!",1045440000,2,1713,4.7324414715719065
475318,5,6302484391,"HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE was the first non-musical comedy to be released in the CinemaScope ratio.  The film was released in 1953, which proved to be Monroe's breakthrough, watershed year, with the success of MILLIONAIRE, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES and NIAGARA cementing her place as one of the top box-office attractions of 1953.
MILLIONAIRE is one of Monroe's most delightful offerings.  She plays the visually-challenged Pola, who, along with Chotzi (Lauren Bacall - KEY LARGO, THE BIG SLEEP) and 'Loco' (Betty Grable - MOTHER WORE TIGHTS) rents a Manhattan penthouse in the hopes of snagging rich husbands.
Of course, Fate often hands you things totally unexpected, and soon the girls realise that money can't be a substitute for happiness.  There are plenty of pin-sharp observations about the opposite sex, a good 50-odd years before ""Sex and the City"" decided to make a whole TV show about women in the Big Apple.
Marilyn, Lauren and Betty make a colorful trio, and the CinemaSope picture is indeed a treat to the eyes.
The DVD includes restoration comparisons and trailers.  Available separately or as part of the Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection.",1028678400,23,1156,5.132978723404255

475320,4,6302484391,"""How To Marry A Millionaire"", produced in 1953 by 20th Century Fox, was the original vehicle for introducing Fox's revolutionary Cinemascope presentation to the public (however, ""The Robe"" would be the first CinemaScope film actually released) and it showcased a number of Fox's established and rising stars.
The main body of the movie follows the lives of three New York models (played by Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, and Lauren Bacall) in their pursuit of luxury and ease through matrimony. Bacall is the driving force of this team effort, arranging for for them to live in a luxury flat, laying down the ground rules, and singlehandedly maintaining the facade of a sophiscated livestyle. However, Bacall's character tends to judge others by their apparent sophistication. Monroe and Grable characters are less mercenary than Bacall and each has a small character flaw that sometimes leads them astray. Monroe has poor eyesight but refuses to wear her glasses in public which leads to the predictable bumping into people and objects. Grable, on the other hand, is somewhat scatterbrained, usually leading her to miscontrue statements made to her. After initially working together, each character goes into her own vignette, highlighting her path to love, and then they meet up again at the end where of course each of their paths ends in a manner different than the one they had imagined.
Considering the mostly lightweight script, the acting is very good on the whole. Although many viewers today would see the movie to watch Marilyn Monroe, it is Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable who give the better performances. Bacall is excellent in her debut in a comedy role and Grable is an absolute delight, dispensing a sometimes skewed view of life that often finds its mark. The supporting cast is also quite excellent, in particular the performances by William Powell, David Wayne, and Cameron Mitchell.
There are a number of things in the film that may confuse or at least put off today's audiences. The movie opens with a orchestra playing a composition by Alfred Neuman (who is seen conducting) and then shows a number of panoramic shots throughout the film. It is important to remember that the biggest star of this movie was suppose to be the new Cinemascope presentation and Fox's new High Fidelity sound system. While these scenes wowwed audiences in theaters during the film's initial release, watching the same scenes from a DVD widescreen version on a television set greatly lessens their impact.
Nonetheless, if you like the movies of the fifties or a fan of of any of the three principal actors, ""How To Marry A Millionaire"" should be one to add to your collection. Today's audiences will find the story a dated one but much of the humor will translates well to the present. This is a very enjoyable movie.",1012953600,,2816,4.980891719745223
475321,4,6302484391,"According to the video, ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" was the first movie released in CinemaScope. CinemaScope is the super-long screen, and, since this movie was the first, you can tell they made ample use of the longer screen.
Well, at least you can GUESS that they did that. There are many, many scenes where you can tell that they did a shot of all three women - Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Lauren Bacall - sitting next to each other, but because of the pan & scan, you only get to see two of the three on your screen.
Bottom line: if you can find a Letterbox version, buy that instead. Otherwise, it's a cute little story.",1007337600,,632,4.364406779661017

7826799,3,6302484391,"Re-appraising old Monroe movies in the modern age does not show them in a good light. ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" tells a pretty sour tale of three gal pals who try to swindle themselves into a life of money and rich husbands. That's the plot, told with a sense of humour or course, but that's still the plot.

Although it's a fairly nicely filmed movie, it looks very artificial, with any outdoor scenes looking particularly fake. but the cinemascope photography is bright as a button. The three leads (Bacall, Grable and Monroe) make a rather odd trio, but they look and dress great. It's just a shame that the plot leaves such a nasty taste in the mouth. Admittedly Grable ends up ditching the money plan and marrying for love, but not before first telling her suitor that she's wasted her time on him... before having a change of heart and going back to him (oddly, the break up is shown on screen but the re-union is not). Monroe's character finds redemption not by marrying for love, but by accepting herself as a glasses wearer. I could forgive these, but the worst offender is Bacall's character who is the most cut-throat in the game of love. She ends up marrying for love too, resigning herself to being the wife of a ""gas pump jockey"", only to find out that he's been a secret millionaire all along. So the most money-grabbing of the three gets the richest husband. What a great moral message. The film actually ends with a really vile shot of the secret millionaire hubby pulling out a massive rolls of dollar bills and peeling off a hundred to pay for something, and the three ladies all fall off their chairs in a faint at the sight of it. Hilarious punchline? I think not...it's like money as pornography. Presumably in the mid 1950's this was humour, but I found this ending particularly tasteless. I'll have to accept that this attitude is of it's time. But I won't be watching this again",1504224000,,1906,4.556851311953353
