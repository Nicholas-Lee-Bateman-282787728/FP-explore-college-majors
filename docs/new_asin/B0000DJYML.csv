1926081,5,B0000DJYML,"Season 2 finds Jerri Blank just out of jail (again) and starting freshman year again (again).  In this season she deals with the death of her catatonic father. We learn about choosing a career, helping the handicapped, virginity, illiteracy, and cults.  And it is all presented by the most lovable 47 year old freshman ever, Jerri Blank, along with her gay art teacher, her gay history teacher, and her African-American egotistical principal, Onyx Blackman.  Just thinking of some of the dialog brings a smile to my face: 'What was going through your head as those rabid dogs knawed on it?  Did you see me eating the hot dog?'
In many respects the second season of Strangers with Candy is better than the first.  The characters are fully realized and their behavior becomes even more outrageous.  The dialog is sharp and the scenarios more absurd.  The writing and directing for this show does a fantastic job of playing up to the talent of the principal actors.  Throw in some fantastic guest stars and this season is not to be missed.",1064966400,12,1036,4.748603351955308

I can't express my jubilation at the release of this series on DVD.  I love this show so much.  Get this season, get all the seasons.  The show will change your life, and the replay value of these episodes is infinite.

1926129,5,B0000DJYML,"I'm a bigger fan of Season 2 than I am of the first season. So if you're watching for the first time, start with season 2. Amy Sedaris plays a middle aged woman (Jerri) who is sobering up after a life of drugs and theft and going back to finish high school. There are various kinds of humor in the show; dark, sarcastic, slap-stick, raunchy. It doesn't aggrandize gross humor though, it uses it to be ridiculous, not sexy or controversial. Steven Colbert is hilarious in this as one of her teachers. He's regularly performing pieces of literature for his students- my favorite of which is when he acts out Maria's last scene in West Side Story, complete with awful imitation accent. There are probably a million and one ways someone up-tight could get offended by this show, but it's so NOT serious about any of its jokes that it pulls off every one. Jerri signs into her diary saying ""Dear Diary, I'm sorry for those hateful racist things I said about you..."". Every one of the characters adds to the humor in this show. It's an odd comedy, but definitely worth watching at least one episode to see if you like it.",1420070400,,1115,4.497536945812808

I vaguely remember watching the initial run, but have recently rediscovered this quirky show via internet streaming. Amy Sedaris shows positively lethal wit as Jerri Blank, who is continually snatching defeat from the jaws of V-I-C-T-O-R-Y! This season she gets a fake divorce, is the driver in a hit and run accident, loses her dad to rabid dogs, battles illiteracy, gets a job to get some expensive shoes and joins a cult...it's really pathetic!

Guy, Jerri's actively catatonic father, is dead by episode three to be replaced by a weakened rendition of the old favorite, Stu, the Meat Guy.  The sexual tension between Noblett and Jellineck has fizzled.

I loved this show when it first aired on Comedy Central back in 1999.  I'm surprised to see it on DVD but love the fact that it is.  Either you think this is a funny show or you don't, there really isn't any inbetween.  It's dark, edgy and racey and some people don't like that kind of humour.  If you do, then get this or at least check it out.  The premise of a bad after school special fits it well and I think that the movie (coming out in the summer of 2005) will cause a resurgence in the show.

1926215,4,B0000DJYML,"STRANGERS WITH CANDY is one of my favorite shows. Why have they stopped making it? Although good, SEASON TWO is the weakest link out of the three seasons. This is mainly due to a two part episode that involved Jerry joining an annoying cult. I could have done without those two episodes, but thats just me, I have to say out of 30 episodes in all those two were the only ones I didn't care for. With a running time of 4 hours and 33 minutes, SEASON 2 has 10 episodes: 1. Yes You Can't, 2. Behind Blank Eyes, 3. The Virgin Jerri, 4. The Goodbye Guy, 5. Hit And Run, 6. The Blank Page, 7. To Love, Honor, And Pretend, 8. The Blank Stare part 1, 9. The Blank Stare part 2, 10. (season finale) A Price To High For Riches. ""Strangers With Candy"" is very original and features one of the finest and funniest cast of characters ever. The cast features: Amy Sadaris, Paul Dinello, and Stephen Colbert. The show may have been short lived on ~Comedy Central~ but it will always live on in the hearts of a legion of devoted fans.",1102032000,,1018,4.225641025641026
1926216,5,B0000DJYML,"Strangers With Candy is a perfect send-up of insipid topical  teen shows like My So-Called Life and the After School Specials that spewed conformist propoganda into the ears and eyes of America's youth every weekday afternoon during the 1980's.  I remember watching it back when I had cable, as well as a slew of other top-notch shows that were on Comedy Central at the time (Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, South Park, T.V. Funhouse etc...).  Strangers With Candy may not have been the best of these shows, or even the edgiest, but it very well may have been the darkest.  South Park and T.V. Funhouse were/are certainly caustic and dark, but 'Strangers' was pitch black.  This humor is truly without reverence.  Nothing is sacred, all is petty, and the mere concept of morality itself becomes the joke.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

I recently rented the first and second seasons and the latter is the better of the two.  I am looking forward to renting the third season.  If you are a fan of black comedy, Strangers With Candy will tickle your funny bone - and then break it.",1096070400,5,1388,4.905579399141631

1926218,5,B0000DJYML,"I love this show, it is probably the funniest show ever aired on comedy central besides South Park and Dave Chapelle.  I'm so glad that ""SWC"" was finally released on dvd, now I can watch all of these great old episodes that never cease to make me laugh.  I highly reccomend you buy season one and two on dvd, especially if you have a sick sense of humor.",1077840000,,354,4.1911764705882355
1926219,5,B0000DJYML,"this is black comedy at its greatest. the first disc of this second season DVD collection houses, quite possibly, the most creative, hysterical episodes of the entire series. ""yes you can't"", ""the blank page"", ""the goodbye guy"", and ""the virgin jerri"" are my personal favorites. the only weak episode on in this collection is ""a price higher than riches,"" although that episode still manages to be ruthlessly hilarious (as a shoe salesman, jerry asks a man in a wheel-chair ""how he wore the last pair out"")
in an age where the vast majority of non-sitcom comedy shows are parody humor (i.e. SNL, MadTV) it's a breathe of fresh air to see something so inventive, creative, and politically incorrect; the central theme to this show is the satiring of the ""after-school special"" mentality; where in the end, the protagonist discovers some new enlightening, cathartic revelation about life and everything is okay again, but it's much more complex than that. the writers toss in some of the most bizarre dialogue, often laced with double negatives and contradictions (such as ""must be great to hope for the things you wish you wanted"", etc ...)
all in all, this show is certainly not for everyone. as amy sedaris (jerri blank) said herself in an interview: ""I'm glad everyone doesn't like it, that would mean i was doing something wrong."" amen.",1077062400,13,1339,4.929203539823009

1926221,5,B0000DJYML,"Strangers With Candy is a brilliant black comedy featuring one of the most (intentionally) ugly characters on TV. One of the thrilling things about Stranger with Candy is that it shows and in some ways even celebrates our darkest, worst impulses. We both are horrified by and are deeply sympathetic to Jerri's various plights: taking drugs, being made fun of, smashing the glass of a store front and stealing, calling people racist/sexist/homophobic names, etc etc. As one of the writers says on the bonus interview, ""Jerri is easily hurt for someone so cruel."" As viewers we get to play both sides of the fence. We get to vicariously enjoy her cruelty by reassuring ourselves that this is satire, and also root for her to win when she finds herself as the underdog.
This second season is a marked improvement from the first season when the writers were still finding their footing and developing the characters. They now are blossoming into flowers that smell as good as mace, and are as powerful. I'm looking forward to the third season DVD when things get even better.",1076803200,2,1071,4.826086956521739

I thought about the episodes though, gave it a few days and watched them again.  I realized that the humor was there but it wasn't as outrageous and shocking as season one.  The jokes are extended to fill out the story which gives the shows a slower pace and the two-part episode about a lurking cult seems to go on forever.  The original thrust of `Strangers With Candy' was a `Mad Magazine' type of parody of those insipid teen-targeted after-school specials that always had a wholesome and morally sound conclusion, but the pacing of the second season seems more like a parody of the daytime soap operas.  As a friend of mine said, ""It's funny, in a sad kind of way""which I remembered when I watched some of them for a third time and then I found them funnier.",1068336000,5,862,4.529032258064516

1) Yes You Can't! - During Career Week at Flatpoint Mr. Jellineck quits to follow his dreams of being a painter, while Jerri tries to discover just what her dreams are.
2) Behind Blank Eyes - Jerri falls for an ambitious blind boy named Alan who, despite staunch opposition from the school, aspires to play football for Flatpoint High.
3) The Virgin Jerri - Jerri reclaims her virginity and fights with her animal instincts as a date with a notorious cherry popper threatens to end her mission of purity before it's begun.
4) The Goodbye Guy - The Blanks are stricken with a death in the family, and now Jerri must learn how to deal with the loss of an important figure in her life.
5) Hit and Run - Jerri and Mr. Noblet must deal with intense guilt after playing a part in a horrible hit and run accident which has robbed Mr. Jellineck of his most prized possession, his own face.
6) The Blank Page - With dreams of becoming a cheerleader, Jerri attempts to learn how to read, and overcome the shame of her illiteracy.
7) To Love, Honor, and Pretend - The lines of reality begin to blur during a fake marriage exercise in Health Class led by Coach Wolf and Mr. Jellineck who act as an example of a ""good marriage"" for students, including a clueless Jerri, to follow.
8) The Blank Stare Part 1 - Looking for love in all the wrong places, Jerri drops out of Flatpoint High for a freaky cult.
9) The Blank Stare Part 2 - The Flatpoint faculty kidnaps Jerri in a desperate attempt to deprogram her from a cult clone back into a high school drone.
10) A Price Too High for Riches - When an expensive sneaker takes Flatpoint by storm, a financially challanged Jerri learns that sometimes money is a girl's best friend.
There you have it! All 10 episodes from the second season of Strangers with Candy completely commercial free.  There is episode commentary by Stephen Colbert, Paul Dinello, and Amy Seadris on Behind Blank Eyes, The Goodbye Guy, Hit and Run, and The Blank Page.  There is also an exclusive interview with Stephen Colbert, Paul Dinello, Greg Hollimon, Amy Sedaris, and Executive Producer Kent Alterman called The Museum of Television and Radio Interview.  As most already know this is a 2-disk set and the DVD box format is the same as Season 1, which is very nice considering some of the cases for DVD's out there today.
