8644545,5,B00IPRVCCA,"Sadly, I own this movie, but there are not Japanese subtitles. It is an absolutely beautiful film. The subtle acting and clear emotions are only rivaled by perfect locations and set design. Ichikawa Ibiz and Miki Nakatani are so expressive and emotive, even when they are saying nothing (which is frequently). Cinematography is beautiful. From what I understand, it does take a few liberties with the traditional Rikyu story as it is based on a novel (mostly the scenes with a Korean woman and the actual ending), but overall it is a triumph of Japanese cinema.",1434153600,3,561,4.854166666666667
