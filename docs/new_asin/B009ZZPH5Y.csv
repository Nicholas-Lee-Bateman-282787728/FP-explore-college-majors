5374435,4,B009ZZPH5Y,"This is really a fun series. The actors fit their characters real well. Being an American and not familiar with the actors, I keep finding similarities with American stars.  Jack ( Shaun Johnson is a younger and more handsome David Carradine; Lou (Michelle Morgan) really reminds me of Rachel Leigh Cook ; and Ty ( Graham Wardle is a Rickie Nelson look alike. ( In my opinion). That said they match they parts. It is a relief to see actors that can actually ride a horse and seem confident around farm equipment.

The scenery is awesome, and the story moves quickly. The story lines are easy to follow and have enough suspense to keep your interest, without resorting to F bombs and gratuitous nudity.  I recommend this series for what it is, a well written and well produced family series.",1390780800,10,790,4.628571428571429

8545827,4,B009ZZPH5Y,"I love this series but  I don't like that it's in widescreen display and their no choice to play it in full screen  that's the only thing that I don't like. But I know it's the Canadian version they need to have more options in widescreen Amy& Ty are my favorite couple on the show  I didn't realize this when I bought it on Amazon.com when It arrived and I started watching it I realized that it was in widescreen display and it doesn't give me a choice between widescreen display & full screen display so if you don't like widescreen display keep looking for one that would give you the option of watching it in full screen  I will remember that for next time don't buy the Canadian version  but I still love Hartland very much  if you don't like. widescreen when they came the box said that It's English 5. 1 Dolby Digital, Francis 2. 0 Dolby digital  English SDH subtitles for the deaf & hard of hearing Format : 16x9 1.78FF .810 So I think they should have a choice between widescreen display & full-Screen display",1499472000,,1019,4.35978835978836
