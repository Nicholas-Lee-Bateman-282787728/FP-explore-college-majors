8466998,1,B005DKS1VW,Didn't make through the first minute.  Doesn't deserve 1 star. This was not what I thought I was purchased. I would like my $1.99 returned for false advertising.,1525046400,,161,4.75
8466999,1,B005DKS1VW,Another lousy movie from Amazon!!!!!,1425945600,,36,6.4
8467000,1,B005DKS1VW,Nothing really bad just thought it was a sequel to the original skeleton key. Was kinda disappointed. Will check it out in due time :-),1389571200,,135,4.44
8467001,1,B005DKS1VW,"This was the dumbest movie I've ever seen, It's not like the first ones, I wouldn't watch..It's not even scary ...",1372723200,,114,4.476190476190476
8467002,1,B005DKS1VW,"The well received movie of 2005 ""The Skeleton Key"" has nothing to do with with ""Skeleton Key 3, or it's predecessor, 2"" both of the later are egotistical, self indulgent acting-out behaviors that one usually grows out of by the time they are out of high school, but in rare cases of prolonged adolescence you get nonsense scripts, second hand store clothing and costume store props with a very few (thankfully) cheap CGI thrown in for no apparent reason. What do you have to look forward to? Cheap shaky camera with close ups of, ""Please look at me while I talk to you"". All of this is taking place in a house and it's backyard. To relieve boredom we sometimes have some chick who's covered in blue poster paint remove her bra to show her breasts. Otherwise, just a lot of prancing around the set and acting stupid (no, it isn't satire, parody, conceit, burlesque or anything remotely intelligent). That's all - the end.

Don't believe me! Check out reviews on Amazon for it's predecessor or IMDB where it averaged about 2.5 out of a possible 10.

I am, for the first time ever, considering asking for $1 rental fee back. On principle's sake.",1321228800,2,1142,4.5931372549019605
8467003,1,B005DKS1VW,"Sheesh ! What was I on when this was watched !!! Good lines are worth
repeating,This is one crazy flick.

The fact it is PART 3 ,Is amazing in the least. The script ,WE
GUESS,Brings back multiple characters from PARTS 1 & 2.

Poor,Poor WALTER ?,This guy seems the the glue to storyline. If you
might like SNL skits( The really off-put awkward ones),Maybe Monty
Python-ish nonsense,Some of Mel Brooks-scribed ill thoughts on
film,Think we can stop there.

Cannot tell you would ever search out parts One & Two now,After
Three...Think We are up speed on these crazy beings that inhabit this
flick.",1316995200,,595,4.757281553398058
