857683,2,6304277490,"First of all, this video was not that great.  Don't get me wrong here, I thought the main event was a really great match.  For the most part of the video, it was slow and boring.  There were a few good matches, but that's  about it.  I would only reccomend this video to the real WWF fans out  there!",951004800,,300,4.0

Wanna see a good Pay-per-view, here are some suggestions: Canadian Stampede, Badd Blood, No Way Out, Royal Rumble '99, Valentines Day  Massacre, Wrestlemania 15, Backlash, No Mercy, Armageddon, and most 1996  Pay-per-views.",948499200,,298,5.434782608695652

857686,4,6304277490,"The WWF wasn't always popular.  Between the time Hulk Hogan left and today, the WWF started to slide down hill.  This event occured during that time period, but delivers a good event none the less.  Here you will see  Steve Austin in his second PPV main event, as well as see Triple H before  Triple H was born, when it was only Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and The Rock  when they still called him Rocky Maivia.  The main event is Austin vs.  Vader vs. Undertaker vs. Bret Hart for the WWF championship.  Over all a  good video, only one problem:  WWF Home Video needs to start printing this  again!",940118400,6,595,4.407407407407407

7869477,4,6304277490,"Thanks again to the wonderful source of the internet, I was able to check out an old In Your House entitled In Your House: Final Four. Now the whole build-up for this event for those that don't remember was the main event. The previous month at the Royal Rumble, Stone Cold Steve Austin won the Rumble match by last eliminating The Undertaker, Vader & Bret Hart. One problem, the win was earned controversially as Austin was eliminated by Bret but it wasn't seen by the officials due to a fight between Mankind & Terry Funk. Speaking of controversy, the week before the event, Shawn Michaels forfeited the WWF Championship on RAW with his infamous ""I Lost My Smile"" speech. So with that being said, the match was changed to a WWF Championship match.

Marc Mero vs Leif Cassidy. Once again, for fans that don't remember Leif Cassidy is actually the man that we would all know as Al Snow. With that being said, during this time Snow...I mean Cassidy was putting on good performances in singles matches & that was the case here as this was a solid opening match & a better effort than what you would expect from either man. On a plus, Sable was a quite a sight to look at as well.

The Nation Of Domination vs Goldust, Bart Gunn & Flash Funk. During this time, the members of the Nation consisted of Faarooq, Savio Vega & Crush. This was all about continuing the storyline of the Nation getting stronger as this match didn't really have any build-up towards it so this was just an average match that certainly had it's moments but wasn't anything memorable.

Intercontinental Champion Rocky Maivia vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley. 14 months before they would go on to have one of the most memorable feuds of the WWF Attitude era, they battled here for the first on PPV with the Intercontinental title on the line. This was the rematch from RAW a few weeks back where Rocky won the belt. Hunter tried working over Rocky's shoulder & avoid keeping the match at a fast pace with Rocky showing his athleticism for being a rookie. These two never had a bad match as this was another solid encounter between these two even though they would have better quality matches after this.

WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & The British Bulldog vs Doug Furnas & Phil LaFon. 3 months after debuting at the Survivor Series, Furnas & LaFon finally get their tag team title shot. This match teased a couple of stories being told as Owen & Bulldog were more concerned with one upping each other than working as a team which allowed Furnas & LaFon to take advantage since they were willing to work as one. A great tag team match but like I said, the story was mostly about Owen & Bulldog trying to best the other which lead to the wierd ending.

WWF Championship ""Final Four"": Bret Hart vs Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Undertaker vs Vader. This was a unique contest for it's time as this match was similar to how a fatal fourway match is executed with a few different rules stating that elimination is earned by pinfall, submission & or being thrown over the top rope. This was a wild contest right from the get-go with non-stop action along with so many moments including both sides continuing their previous storylines, Vader getting heavily busted open after taking a boot to the face by Taker with a chair in hand & just going on a rampage from there, Austin relentlessly going after Bret to make sure he didn't get eliminated by anyone else but him & even the rare confrontation (for that time) between Bret & Taker at the end. Other moments featured Bret executing an impressive super-suplex on Vader & pay attention to what happens to Austin when Taker throws him over the rope, knee first on the apron. Just an awesome match from start to finish.

In the end, this event didn't really have a bad match on the card & the main event alone is worth the price of admission so I recommend giving this one a look when you get the chance.",1281571200,2,3912,4.510578279266572
7869478,5,6304277490,"Leif Cassidy VS Marc Mero: Crappy gimmick aside for Cassidy, this was an excellent match.

Farooq, Crush, and Savio Vega VS Golddust, Flash Funk, and Bart Gunn: A decent six man tag match.

Rocky Miavia VS Hunter Hearst Hemsley: A good match between the two. They had a good feud early in both there careers before they made it to super stardom.

Furnas @ Lafon VS Owen Hart and British Bulldog: I don't know whatever happened to Furnas and Lafon but they had looked good in this match. Too bad it ends in a DQ.

Hart VS Vader VS Austin VS Undertaker: One of the greatest fatal four way matches ever created. I don't know why this is not on a dvd set but it should be. An excellent match.

Overall, a good PPV. The main event is well worth worthing.",1204675200,,749,4.283687943262412

Merc Mero V. Leif Cassidy
Leif is actually Al Snow...fun. Ok opener that some the crowd into it some what. Mero wins. **1/2

Goldust, Flash Funk, & Bart Gunn V. Faarooq, Savio Vega, & Crush
ok match that had some good spots in it. Nation Od Domination win. **1/2

WWF Interocntinental Championship:
Rocky Maivia (Champion) V. Hunter Hearst Helmsley
weird match looking back at it...because it wasn't that good. It is watchable and that's about it with a few spots in it. Rocky retain. **1/2...three two and a half star matches to open a five match show...not very good. I hope it gets better.

WWF Tag Team Championship:
Owen Hart & British Bulldog (Champions) V. Doug Furnas & Phil LaFon
Awesome Tag team match that could ahve been alot longer, but was still very solid. Furnas & LaFon win by DQ ***3/4

Final Four Match for the WWF Championship:
Bret Hart V. Stone Cold Steve Austin V. Undertaker V. Vader
it's a elimination match were you are elimination by being thrown over the top rope like the Royal Rumble, pinfall, or submission. Awesome match that I actually think is a little overrated. The match drags a little bit here and there but it is still awesome with Bret winning the vacant title even though he loses it the next night to Sid. ***3/4

Overall, two matches were awesome and three matches were watchable. It's up to you.",1138752000,2,1417,4.670682730923695
7869480,3,6304277490,"THIS is where the WWF started to pick up steam in my opinion. They pushed two of the companies biggest future stars to a match on this ppv, with Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs. Rocky Miavia for the first time on ppv. Also, around this point, it was becoming obvious that Austin was gonna be huge. I was only 13 at the time but I could still realize that Austin needed to be the champion. Well, there goes your Historical Value of the ppv, now to the top 3 matches of the night.

Marc Mero vs. Leif Cassady

 Yeah, I know. But hey, at least they gave them some time. Of course Snow is a great athlete, but i always felt that Marc Mero was underrated. watchable match here. 1.5/5

Owen Hart & Davey Boy Smith vs. Furnas & Lafon

 I always liked the challengers, but accepted that they'd never get anywhere, like Dean Malenko. Owen Hart was one of my favourite childhood wrestlers and Davey was an undeniable talent. Very good in-ring work from everyone involved, nice heat between the champs, but the match had no purpose other than being filler, so not much substance. 2.5/5

Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin vs. Vader vs. Undertaker

 Amazing match. So wild, but in a pre-Attitude way, if you know what i mean. The best qualities of every one comes into play here. There is too much stuff here to go into the details, but this is the match with Vader's infamous ""Crimson Mask"" Raw Cover. Over the top mayhem, only drawback is that the star of the match, Vader, went nowhere after this match. 4.5/5

All in all, not worth the price. Just search for a download of the main event. Consider this the 97 version of ""New Year's Revolution.""",1110672000,,1623,4.416107382550336
7869481,5,6304277490,"Final Four has always been one of my favorite IYH events.  this was when IYH still had some good events, unlike 98-99, where the WWF seemed to be on autopilot with the IYH series.  I was fortunate to have been able to acquire this tape when it was still relatively inexpensive.

IYH:FF picks up right after the Royal Rumble 97, and is a shining example of consistency with your storylines and how smooth they can flow.  Steve Austin is eliminated from the Rumble, but the referees don't notice, so he sneaks back in, eliminates Bret Hart, Vader & Undertaker to win.  However, WWF President Gorilla Monsoon voids Austin's title win upon review of the videotape, and orders the championship match here.  Great buildup of the main event throughout the card.

On the undercard, the not-quite-yet People's Champion, Rocky Maivia battles Hunter Hearst Helmsley, the ""Greenwich snob"", defending the WWF IC belt.  Also, the tag straps being defended by the newly reformed Hart Foundation (Owen & Bulldog) against Doug Furnas & Phil Lafon.

Probably my only 5-star review, so that shows you how good this tape is.  A must-buy.",1095206400,,1117,4.8936170212765955
