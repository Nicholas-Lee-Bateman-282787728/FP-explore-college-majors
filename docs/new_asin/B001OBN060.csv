8330252,5,B001OBN060,If you like Linda Blair you will like this one of course. Was a good deal for the price and played well.,1403222400,,104,3.772727272727273
8330253,4,B001OBN060,"I've written a detailed review for the Panik House release of ""Chained Heat"" which compared this VSC release and the original Vestron Video version of this film-See Panik House Review for more info. For this VSC version, I'm giving it 4 Stars due to ""Chained Heat"" being edited to 88 min, down from the 96 min on the original Vestron Video release. What really sets this VSC DVD set apart from the recent Panik House release is the picture and sound quality. VSC have done a nice job in the presentation of all the films offered in this set. A widescreen presentation and the commentary by Linda Blair for ""Chained Heat"" gives a nice added touch. If you would like to replace your old VHS version with this one, it would be a good choice.",1345852800,2,738,4.474074074074074
8330254,4,B001OBN060,I had all three movies on the DVD on VHS. They were all entertaining. I just wanted to replace my VHS with DVDs,1304208000,,111,3.869565217391304
8330255,5,B001OBN060,"Now i have got to admit I love the movie chained heat! (5 STARS FOR CHAINED HEAT ONLY) Now here is how i rate the rest of those two movies.

Now you already know Chained Heat is a 5 star movie.

Red Heat it was ok. That is a 3 star movie.

But Jungle Warriors, That is a one star movie. (Other words it is Boo-Boo!, and it was a Puke!)

But then again I'm Glad that Chained Heat is Finally on DVD! Although it suppose to be release with the rest of the Chained Heat movie! It's to bad i promise my best freind i give this to her as a birthday present! But i got this movie on VHS! So it's all good! I might order it again evendoe i got in on vhs! Mabye! Thanks Amazon!

8330256,3,B001OBN060,"Well good news first, these movies look great, Linda Blair even gives commentary on Chained Heat & Red Heat, sound is good enough, trailors included. Now the bad...Chained Heat is the heavily cut 88 Min Cable TV version, Red Heat & Jungle Warriors suck (not the DVD quality, the movies themselves). Still until a better DVD is Available I would recommend this just for Chained Heat, the picture is crystal clear and properly formatted (no visable boom mics!)& Blair's commentary is both informative & entertaining. Worth getting if you can find it cheap.",1257120000,16,554,4.967741935483871
