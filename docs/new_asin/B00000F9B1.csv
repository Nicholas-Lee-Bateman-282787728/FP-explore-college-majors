7907903,2,B00000F9B1,This was good during that time frame but too outdated for today. It is not a good teaching tape. It is good for intertainment for older people and people who have no clue about saltwater fishing. It may have some other purposes but for me it is just takin up space in my house.,1267142400,,277,4.148148148148148

But you have no information about the content of your videos, so how could I make an intelligent choice on what to buy? Provide  info on the content and they might sell.",949449600,6,263,4.595744680851064
