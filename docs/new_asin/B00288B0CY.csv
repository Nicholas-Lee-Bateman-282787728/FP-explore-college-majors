8355963,4,B00288B0CY,"There is also an Hispanic movie also titled ""Skate or Die"", perhaps one made expressly for video given its demonstration of low film technic and overall ""look"", which neither Amazon's WWW sites nor the Internet Movie Data Base properly distinguish from this quite good French motion picture of the same title. The superior one in French is available as this DVD (having subtitles in English), the other (rather dismal) one in Spanish also available on DVD (with no subtitles in any language).

To help the Amazon user to sort this out, here is a listing from my own list of DVDs and VHS tapes, in the North American DVD editions which I own, of these two cinematic works:

Skates: Skate or Die!: Wrong Place, Wrong Time. N.B.: This is the 2008 action film (in French, with subtitles in English) of the two very different films of this title. Link Productions 210070-DV.

Skates: Skate or Die!: ellos surgieron de la nada para cambiarlo todo. N.B.: This is the 2012 youth  comedy (in Spanish, without subtitles) of the two very different movies of this title. Distri-Max DMS-0348.

The French film is a well-made motion picture of intensely exciting action and interest. The two young friends (both aged about 20) have witnessed the death of a dude involved in a drug transaction and are fleeing the men who are chasing them in order to kill these two witnesses of the murder. Corrupt police get involved, trying to track down and to kill the two youths, in order to keep secret their collusion in the Parisian underworld of drug deals from which they receive kick-backs from the dealers. The chase is long, ingenious, and entails some truly virtuoso skateboarding on the parts of Mickey Maheu and Idriss Diopp (playing, respectively, the roles of Jerme and Benjamin), both of them good-looking and quite competent actors.

The Spanish film, for the little that it is worth, features three teenage friends who have encounters with a older (aged ca. 30) violently bullying thug who, along with two of his equally low-life pals, is stalking the teens. The music is lively Hispanic stuff and there is a music video embedded within the film. Teenagers abound in this film who, when they dance, do so in hyper-energetically joyous mania to its music. At one point, the three friends assault the bully (or thug, whichever he is most) and his cohorts with their skateboards. Later, when there is a confrontation between the bully and the three teenage pals, when the bully falls down. The dancers surrounding the man turn on him, giving him such a vicious collective thrashing that they leave him for dead. As for the occasional skateboarding, it is very perfunctory trifle compared to what one sees in the French film and there is not enough of it in view, anyway, in the Spanish movie to justify use of the title.

Anyway, hopefully these comments sort out the two films for Amazon's potential purchasers of either or both of them, clarify which one is which, and give some idea of the respective worth of each.",1414195200,,3005,4.800773694390716
