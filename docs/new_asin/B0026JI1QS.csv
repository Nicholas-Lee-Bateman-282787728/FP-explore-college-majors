3854041,1,B0026JI1QS,"This movie was the worst i have seen in a while. The torture in the movie makes you want to figure out the who, what and why. It left me very puzzled until the last few minutes of the movie then you get a better understand. Im glad i rented from the RedBox a $1 was all this movie was worth. Truely not a must see again.",1248825600,3,320,3.791044776119403
3854042,3,B0026JI1QS,"Knowing this sat on the back burner for a couple years then being released within a year of Laurence Fishburne's other torture film made me worry a bit, and if you have seen the other one then this will seem like a mirror in more ways than one.

A quick synopsis of this is simply covering a terror/kidnap and torture film focusing on the anatomy in the title. Laurence plays the captor and Phillippe plays the victim. Putting aside the rightful critiques (that one can read about extensively online) regarding the horrible accents, choppy writing and poor scene mixing, you might get some light entertainment from this. I was not a fan of anything in the film until the final three plot twists given to us in the last two minutes. I would have to say it might leave a better feeling with you once you know why the accents sucked, why they were writing the film towards a known conclusion and what the greater good is (supposedly) being protected here.

The supplements are weak and do not give this a higher rating. The making-of is 11 minutes long and is entirely about how incredible everyone is to be around (my least favorite kind of supplement). The trivia track could be played on the first watch as this is not a re-watchable film and the trivia is inconsequential to the film. This appeared to be a passion piece by those involved, and the interview supplements highlight how they felt this was a statement film for ""what is going on today.""

Summary: Not great but not bad either, the sound and picture clarity are adequate and the violence all happens off screen regarding the removal of digits.",1246752000,8,1606,4.608391608391608

3854044,5,B0026JI1QS,"The plot was mind-bottling. Fishburne was amazing, and the music created a special atmosphere in the film. I loved how the movie switched off between the past and present.

3854045,5,B0026JI1QS,"To protect your loved ones? To protect freedom? To protect millions of lives? What is the cost? How far are you willing to bend your morals or ethics? We try to give the impression of being a civilized politically correct society that can resolve conflict without the use of violence. In a perfect world that should be our perception but the world is not perfect & violence is inevitable. I'm reminded of ""Marathon Man"" when Dustin Hoffman is asked, ""Is it safe?"" Both these movies share a common thread that each seeks an answer. Not just any answer but a truthful answer. Lawrence Fishburne plays his role very well & very convincingly. One of the best movies he's acted in. The movie is fascinating & I recommend it for those who have the patience to let the story unfold",1374969600,,774,4.575539568345324
3854046,5,B0026JI1QS,"Wow, a movie where first at least my heart was going out to the all american boy next door. Thinking how will he escape or kill his captors. But until the end how my view changed and this once poor unfortunate, tortured individual really deserved what he had coming to him.
People after seeing the film might think that the people extracting the information may have gone too extremes. But to save lives who wouldn't do the same.
An excellent film ,with some talented people in it. Some strong performences, and yet this is one of those films where not a mention is ever said at any award show.",1372291200,,594,4.458715596330276

One of the best movies ever. Ryan Phillipe (a great actor, one of the best out there) will only star in good movies. He won't sign up for a bad movie just to make money.

3854052,5,B0026JI1QS,Once again Ryan Phillippe puts out another outstanding performance. A little different to his usual this time with less of the action but the mind games and ending plot certainly make up for that,1324684800,,195,4.764705882352941
3854053,4,B0026JI1QS,"This is a suspenseful, ""what is going on,"" ""who should we believe"" 2006 film. A young man who says he is from Holland is in love with a young woman who says she is from Morocco. The man leaves the woman in the US and flies to Morocco saying he is going to help feed the starving people there. He is accompanied by a guide. He and the guide are kidnapped by people dressed as Muslims. He is drugged. He wakes tied up, not knowing where he is, and sees the guide killed for making insulting remarks about Muslims. Laurence Fishburne plays the Muslim leader, but is he? He insists that the man knows certain things and wants him to tell what they are. But what are these things? Who really is the young man? Is his girl friend involved? Who is behind Fishburne? What is he really trying to find out? Why is it so important that he cuts off four of the man's fingers? The man put one million dollars in his bank account. Where did he get the money? What is it for? There is a surprise ending to this suspenseful tale.",1320796800,5,1013,4.2
3854054,3,B0026JI1QS,"Five fingers is an intense mystery variation of the ""Is he or isn't he"" variety. In this case the twist is not only ""is he"" but also ""are they?"" A Dutch idealist is kidnapped by a group of terrorists who torture him to obtain information he claims he doesn't have. Is he a do gooder in Morocco to help with a food program, or a terrorist intent on a worldwide scheme to poison people? But while we ponder that question, are his interrogators really terrorists or are they CIA counter agents trying to determine whether or not the Dutchman is a terrorist and obtaining information about his terrorist cell?

The Dutch idealist is played by Ryan Phillippe (1974). He's best remembered as TV's first gay teen in ""One Life to Live"". Subsequently he's been in films like ""Antitrust"" (2001), ""Crash"" (2004), and ""Flags of our Fathers"". Phillippe does a good job but he has problems maintaining his accent.

The chief interrogator is Laurence Fishburne (1961). Fishburne may be best known as Dr. Ray Langston from the hit series ""CSI"", but it was his great performance as Ike Turner in ""What's Love Got to do with it?"" (1994) that propelled him to stardom, and an Academy Award nomination, and his role as Morpheus in the ""Matrix"" trilogy that brought him wide scale attention. Fact is, Fishburne has given us many excellent performances, from his early years (Mr. Clean in ""Apocalypse Now"", Bumpy Rhodes in ""Cotton Club""). He does his usual intense job here, and his accent is great.

Fishburne is assisted by real life spouse Gina Torres (1969). You'll recognize her as the boss from ""Suits"" (2011) and for her role as the deadly Anna from ""Alias"" (2001-6) and as Zoe in ""Firefly"" (2002-3). She also does a great job.

Colm Meany and Said Taghmaoui put in good performances in supporting roles.

Most of the film takes place in a warehouse where Phillippe is tortured by having a finger cut off each time he lies or refuses to provide information he is expected to have. It's a tribute to director (and co-writer) Laurence Malkin that the film never drags or feels claustrophobic or stagey. This was the second time as a director for Malkin and his fourth screenplay.

Definitely not for the squeamish.",1310774400,2,2197,4.738219895287958
3854055,3,B0026JI1QS,"You get the funds to begin a ""food for the poor"" program in Morocco.  Within hours of arrival, you are kidnapped, and transported to an unknown location.

Then, the interrogation begins, one finger at a time.  Take note of the name of the movie.  Oh, and did I mention that one of your hobbies is as a jazz pianist?

Ninety percent of this movie occurs with the kidnapped victim chained to a chair, with the action being the ""banter"" that occurs between victim and interrogator (Laurence Fishburne).  The strength of the movie is in its pointed brutality, the projection of helplessness of the victim, and finally the ""what the..."" twist at the end.

Not an uplifting film, but what do you expect when the theme is torture and terrorism?",1292112000,,737,4.666666666666667
3854056,5,B0026JI1QS,"While traveling to Morocco to initiate a food program of his own to help poor kids, the Dutch Martijn is kidnapped by a group of terrorists and his guide Gavin is executed in cold blood in front of him. Along the days, Martijn is tortured by a Muslin man and Aicha and looses four fingers. In the end, the truth about his travel is finally disclosed. Fishburne and Phillipe as the two main characters locked in a battle of mind and will power turn in an excellent performance, as do the supporting characters. The story starts swiftly and almost from the beginning the tension is notched up, and with each twist and turn the movie continues to question who really is the good guy in all of this, if indeed there could be one. A real psychological treat if you just enjoy it.",1268352000,2,774,4.419580419580419
3854057,5,B0026JI1QS,"If you want to see the types of animals that are trying to destroy civilization, here it is.

This movie is all acting, it could have been filmed on a high school stage like some of the old Bogart movies.

Not for the squeamish. You may want to eat an hour before the movie.

What would Eric Holder say?",1259971200,,303,4.101694915254237
3854058,5,B0026JI1QS,"The negative reviews made me skeptical. But the film turned out to have excellent acting and dialogue. It is all about mind games during a torture interrogation of a young Dutch lefty. Are the interrogators CIA trying to trick the guy into giving up his collaborators? They eventually drop the mystery stance and claim to be on the rebel side that he eventually claims to be on or admits to be on as the case might be. But they want him to convince them that he is really one of them by telling everything he knows. He either does not want to do that because he does not completely trust them, or he cannot as the case might be because maybe he really is lying and working for the CIA and cannot.

There are only two probable outcomes. Either they are really CIA and he should not trust his kidnappers, or he is really CIA and does not know all the people in the cell in the Netherlands. So if all the viewers guess randomly, like flip a coin, half will be right! FYI, I guessed right.

But the outcome is not so important actually to appreciation of the film as film. What is important is that the acting is very good and gripping and as details come out during the mind games and torture you want to go back and think how previous details might fit or not, and you are inspired to reinterpret some. It is a good thinking person's film. Like some of my most admired spy films. I want to watch it again even though I know the outcome. It would be like studying the moves in classic chess games, which I used to do when younger.

In terms of political relevance, yeah this is probably timely in a way. There is some nasty stuff going on out there in the world on the dark side of empire building and anger at it, including torture. And the passion and commitment on the various sides can be argued. But this is not really anything new. The political statement is not the reason that this is a fine film. But the political implications are at least provocative and may be instructive for some viewers.

The making-of feature on the DVD is not great, but it is better than the average making-of which tends to be insulting to one's intelligence and a waste of time unless you happen to be star-struck.

Five fingers refers to the fact that his passion is playing the piano and they cut off his fingers brutally one by one to turn up the heat on him as the interrogation proceeds. But this is not gratuitous gore. It is so cruel on their part and such a sacrifice on his part that even his captors (whoever they are) come to admire his courage and passion, whether he is CIA and passionately loyal to America, or a real left-wing activist who is completely determined to bring down the ruling global order. The point is well made that there is enormous passion and motivation on both sides out there on the battle lines. I think well crafted spy films often make this sort of point, but not in such a viscerally convincing and memorable way. It is such an obvious point that it is easy to say at the level of words. But making this point in convincingly human terms is very well done in this film. Exceptionally well done in my opinion.",1256256000,3,3132,4.337883959044369

3854062,4,B0026JI1QS,"MARTIJN (Ryan Phillippe), a Dutch pianist and friend, travels to Morocco to help start a food program for malnourished children or so he says. Within moments of his arrival Martijn and his friend are abducted on a bus by a group of terrorists, only one of them is injected with a drug, but both are imprisoned.  Do you see the mystery forming already? Under threat of death, Martinj engages in a mental chess match with AHMAT (Laurence Fishburne), trying to learn his captor's true objective and avoid death.  When he fails to answer the questions that his captors are asking, they begin to cut off his fingers.  Since he plays piano this is very significant.  The captors seem to know all about him.  How do they know so much?  Is it the beautiful mysterious girlfriend that he left at home?  To add to the thrill and mystery of the movie Gina Torres (Fishburne's wife in real life) enters and gives an award winning performance.  First she appears to sympathize with Martijn, but then she flips and is working with Ahmat.  After intense interrogation, Martijn decides to give in and writes down some information on a piece of paper.  I am still in the dark because the movie ended with me not knowing if he really knew nothing or did he really know something?  I enjoyed the movie.  The characters were very convincing and memorable.  There are several unpredictable things that happen at the end.  But the one thing that did not happen was to reveal to me why he was abducted and if he was a case of mistaken identity.  I searched on the internet for a revelation to the ending and found none.  So kudos to the writer for such mystery in a movie.  How do I feel?  FRUSTRATED!",1249257600,10,1678,4.536666666666667
