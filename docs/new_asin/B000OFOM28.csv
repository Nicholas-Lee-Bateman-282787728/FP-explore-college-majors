8184864,1,B000OFOM28,This was an awful video introduction to lathe machining.  Recap:  Always wear goggles. Never leave your chuck in the bit.  Followed by a very poor overview of the parts of a lathe without any description of the purpose of the part.  The majority of this 48 minute video is watching a single part being cut (out of focus).  A very  unprofessional and disappointing product.  Save your money.,1218412800,17,390,4.731343283582089
