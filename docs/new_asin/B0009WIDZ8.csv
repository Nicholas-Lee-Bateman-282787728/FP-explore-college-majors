8068326,3,B0009WIDZ8,"Vicki Regan has done many of these dance videos showing the basics
of the dance and a few figures to get you going on the dance floor.
As such it is a very basic introduction to Mamo.  It serves a purpose
and has a niche among amateur dancers.",1375228800,,243,4.0625
8068327,3,B0009WIDZ8,"The other reviewers have it right.  There are few good Mambo dance-instruction videos out there and this one barely scratches the surface -- especially if you know what you are doing on the dance floor.  Nevertheless it is useful in communicating a very basic knowledge of this dance. The DVD uses a stay-in-place Basic Step for much instruction; later it shows the simple Side-Step Basic and the Progressive (traveling) Basic as variations. The Cross-Body Turn is nicely executed because the instructors are energetic and poised. There is also the Crossover Break with Walkaround Turn, Twirls for the Lady, Twirls for the Man, Twirls for both of them and the Challenge Position among the details demonstrated. There is a track about ""dirty dancing"" styling that makes you want to search Youtube for the choreographed originals. I enjoyed watching the instructional couple dance.",1358208000,,879,5.226950354609929
8068328,5,B0009WIDZ8,"I viewed several dance DVD's of 3 different artists from our public library. Vicki's videos were the only ones that take you through the process at a pace that truly allows you to learn, and enjoy it. That is why we decided to buy. After two viewings, we are ready to go! When our daughters asked for gift ideas for our upcoming anniversary, we easily said, ""More of her dance DVD's please!""",1270512000,2,391,4.444444444444445
8068329,1,B0009WIDZ8,I can only say that this was a Rookie mistake on my part. I bought this DVD and all I can say is don't waste your money. It has essentially one turn pattern and 2 insignificant steps besides the BASIC step. At this rate you would need twenty DVD's with this level of instruction to be of any value. You can learn as much for free by looking at some of the preview samples that other Instructional Videos Providers have. If you want some content and value for your money get the RED HOT SALSA series by Ron & Bethana Rosario. I did. Hope this helps others avoid the same mistake I made.,1164499200,6,585,4.185840707964601
8068330,5,B0009WIDZ8,"Beginning ballroom dancers are typically introduced to 6 dances: Swing, Tango, Waltz, Rhumba, Foxtrot and Cha Cha. When starting to go to ballroom dance parties, however, they have to leave the floor when Mambo/Salsa music is played.  This DVD shows exactly how fundamental patterns such as crossover break or open break we learn in Rhumba or Cha Cha can be applied to Mambo/Salsa, so that we can start dancing at parties immediately.  Even those who do not know these patterns well can learn easily because they are repeated enough times.  This DVD also includes ""dirty dancing"" (but tasteful) patterns for fun.  Vicki Regan's You Can Dance! series is good value.",1126224000,12,664,5.009090909090909
8068331,1,B0009WIDZ8,"This is dancing for retards.  It took them over 30 minutes to teach 3 steps.  You end up spending an hour and only learn 6 steps total.  Don't waste your money on this video.  It is helpful to get started, but that's about it.  Josie's Dance Hot Salsa is much better for salsa, there is not much out there for mambo.",997142400,13,316,4.114754098360656
