8233215,4,B000YKSOCM,"A very funny spaghetti western, somewhat in the vein of the Trinity movies.  Providence is a foppish, vain bounty hunter.  He's a crack shot, brilliant, eccentric, and not completely honest.  He breaks the Hurricane Kid out of jail regularly, then catches him again to take to another town to collect the bounty.

It's a lot more slapstick than Trinity, and a lot sillier,  but still a lot of fun.  If you like the Three Stooges, you'll adore this.  If you hate the Stooges, but like Trinity, you'll like this.  I'm a Trinity fan, not a Stooges fan, but this was a lot of fun.  That's why I'm searching for the second one.",1355616000,,622,4.482142857142857
