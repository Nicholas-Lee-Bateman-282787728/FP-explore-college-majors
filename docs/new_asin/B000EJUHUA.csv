8110812,5,B000EJUHUA,"Basically this is an excellent, uneditorialized, documentary.  The author gives voice to three Cubans of different social/economic statuses and captures the Revolution from their individual perspectives. We have often heard the Cuban exiles reviling Castro and lamenting the loss of property and civil rights in Cuba.  It's also helpful to get one's ""feet on the ground"" and hear from those who lived without. It's hard to be fair when you haven't heard the other side of the story.

For additional historical perspective I'm reading Havana Nocturne by T.J. English. Castro may be the bad boy in the classroom, but he is certainly not the only bad boy. And, for some odd reason, the names of the other bad boys are never mentioned. Hmmm.

Thanks to Amazon for making this available.",1353110400,,782,4.992307692307692
8110813,3,B000EJUHUA,"First off, this movie looks like it was shot through cheese cloth. The sound is poor quality. If you can get beyond the sound and video quality, it is an excellent documentary. We are planning a trip to Cuba and are reading as many books and watching as many films as possible to learn about the country before we go. Most movies and books about Cuba tend to have their own political point of view. The movies tend to have a stronger political agenda than some of the books. This movie was distributed by Radical Films. There are scenes of masses of people singing the Internacionale. Still the film provides a valuable picture of the lives of Cubans of different social origins during the period after the revolution. There was an opportunity to read between the lines at times. Watching the part about the third Cuban, a working class man, one saw that he was getting affordable medical care and a regular wage. The documentary made clear the economic hardships of Cuba in the 60s. It is important to see this movie in the context of the time it was made. Castro had mandated racial equality. During this time the United States was struggling with Jim Crow laws. The section about the First Cuban, the upper classes was the weakest section. The narrator of that section understandably chose to remain annonymous. However, I did not get an intimate sense of the lives of Cubans in his social strata. Perhaps the upper strata individuals who were still in Cuba were more defensive about airing their opinions for a documentary.",1327622400,2,1527,4.701492537313433
8110814,5,B000EJUHUA,"It is not hard to understand why this documentary was suppressed only to surface in the new millennium. The three Cubans tell us about their experiences and impression of Cuba at the time, i.e. 1963-64, the first few years after the revolutionaries had toppled Batista's regime.

Today we have another generation that wants to know the true about Cuba .

Not old movies. (we are in 20007)The past is past.",1198108800,,186,4.285714285714286
8110816,5,B000EJUHUA,"An incisive look at the early years of the Cuban Revolution.  It will seem shocking to North Americans raised on a steady diet of cold war anti-Castroism; and with all the attention given human rights issues since the mid-1970s, some will wonder how people ""could ever support such a regime.""

The truth is that in its early years, the Revolution put fresh meat and vegetables on tables that had long been unused to either.  The lower classes are no more ""guilty"" in looking the other way at ""the regime's excesses"" than were the upper classes of regimes past.  Self-interest trumps abstractions every time, as Cuban No. 2 made so eloquently plain.  If only the anti-Castroits were as honest about theirs.",1178409600,4,705,4.841666666666667
