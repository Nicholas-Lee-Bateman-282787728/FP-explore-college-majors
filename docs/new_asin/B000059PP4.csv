1409079,5,B000059PP4,"Bo and Roy keenly sense the bigotry and worthlessness of the common man and his passive acceptance of this material society.  Their experience from school revealed to them the hypocrocy of an education to prepare them for slavery, the nausious realization that most people worship malls and Chinese manufactured trinkets.  Bo and Roy bided their time in high school. They rejected all forms of worthless mainstream social activities and adorned themselves in the mantle of plain t-shirts and worn blue jeans.  But their moment finally came. They graduated from high school and they took their message to the general populace. A message of judgement, violence, and retribution.  A cleansing of the trash people and a celebration of their new faith and power.  The raghead at the service station, beaten by his own pump handle was a collage of brutality and purity that resonated with all believers.  The babbling, impotent, old lady callously and casually missiled with a beer bottle to the head merged violence and humor in a tapestry of genuine lust for life.  As in all dramatic tragedies, our heroes find their last stand in between the worthless, plastic walls of a shopping mall.  The cold, bleak walls of a contrived world where mindless fools pilgrim to worship at the alter of the Gap and eat the manna of Mrs. Fields.  Bo became the sacrifice at our plastic alter.  He never wavered and his passion resonates long after the closing credits.  Your life is incomplete and impoverished without the experience of this grand film.",1060819200,,1534,4.976470588235294

This story of two outcasts who just throw their hands in the air, one with a touch of hope, the other completely jaded captures something that I've never really felt in another movie.

I've just rewatched this film on netflix for the first time in 20+ years and was shocked even more.  As a teen the violence and attitude was just perfect.  As an adult, it is disturbing and dark and funny and still...  Connected with me on some level I thought was gone.  Just a great piece of movie history.  If my parents had wanted to know how I felt, I would have shown them this.  No, I wouldn't have, but it would have been an honest response if I had.",1323043200,,773,4.239726027397261
1409106,5,B000059PP4,"Sometimes a film comes along, that will truly stick with you long after you've seen it. It will gnaw at your mind and make you look at life and people in a very different way, which you never did before. ""The Boys Next Door"" is just such a film for me.

Director Penelope Spheeris is probably most well-known for her work on perennial comedic fare, such as ""Wayne's World"" and ""Black Sheep,"" but long before that she was a very edgy and somewhat visionary filmmaker. Some of her earliest works have a very deep social commentary to them, of which this film is one of her best (and most overlooked). This tale of two high school outcasts, who go to the big city and raise some murderous hell, almost has a modern ring to it. In the wake of real life events, like the massacres at Columbine and Virgina Tech, this film seems less the low-rent crime drama it probably was seen as when it first debuted and more like a prophecy of things to come.

It is absolutely chilling in how it shows the casual use of violence by two supposed teenagers. Their lack of conscience and concern for anything or anyone, save themselves, feels like a mirror being held up to our so-called modern world. What really stuck out for me, though, was the moments of seemingly uncontainable rage expressed by the character of Roy (incredibly performed by Maxwell Caulfield). One scene that truly made my blood run cold, was after his first act of violence on a gas-station attendant, when he and his friend Bo (played by a very young Charlie Sheen, in one of his earliest leading roles) are talking about it in their hotel room, and Roy expresses that the beating wasn't good enough. That he should have killed him. The look of satisfaction on his face as he expresses these thoughts, brought out a dark symmetry to the character, which would dominate everything he does afterwards. It actually comes off like a blueprint to the mindset of such thrill-killers that we see in our real world today. I really enjoyed how the film almost plays like a docudrama in some instances, like this one.

While some of the language and settings might be a bit dated, the emotion and societal insights into the mind of teenage rage are as powerful now as they ever were back in 1985 (when the film debuted). At the time, this film had a bit of controversy about it, due to the amounts of violence shown on screen, but I think that today, in our much more politically-correct minded world-view, it is the thoughts behind the violence which should be more disturbing. It is a film that has truly become MORE relevant as time has gone by, not less. If there is anything lacking in the film, it would be not enough information given on the characters life at home. We see the torment they have with not fitting in with their peers at school, as well as their fears of living out the rest of their lives at dead-end jobs, but there is little info on the role played by the family in helping these boys to be filled with such murderous contempt. There is one scene with Roy's father being shown as a neglectful parent, more interested in getting his next beer than the welfare of his son, but I felt this brief glimpse should have been expand on more. Still, even lacking in this one area, the film is still a very potent brew to behold.

Make no mistake, this is not a ""feel good"" or party film. It is a shocking, and sometimes twisted, look into how society can mold a teenager into a raging killer and how easily that rage can be let loose on an unprepared society. And the fact these two characters are attractive looking, as well, only deepens the scary similarities of our current times. Despite that, however, it is certainly a very worthwhile film and is deserving of much more attention. If you are looking for a film that isn't just out to entertain you, but also make you think, this is one movie you need to seek out! But be warned... prepare to be unnerved by much of what you will see. I doubt many will walk away from this film totally unaffected, nor should they.",1272672000,2,4032,4.466757123473541
1409107,3,B000059PP4,"Earlier this year I watched ""Badlands"" for the first time.  It starred Martin Sheen as a serial killer.  The movie challenged me somewhat but there were a lot of quality aspects to that film.  I didn't realize that I would be watching Martin's son, Charlie Sheen, in his own murder spree in ""The Boys Next Door"".  After watching ""The Boys Next Door"", I came away with the impression that ""father knows best"".  There are a number of things wrong with TBND and the first shortcoming wasn't long in coming.  In the very beginning we are given a psychological profile of a serial killer.  We get information to expalin to us that this film will be a serious study of a serial killer(s).  Then the movie opens up on a series of stereo-types; high school students, uninvolved parents, servicemen, hippies, gays, cops, you name it.  I soon realized that the stereo-type serial killer we get was in keeping with the theme of the film.

Our two ""misfits"" emerge from a sort of mentally challenged ""born loser"" stereo-type to the serial killers we know the introduction has promised.  We are privy to a conversation between these two misfis in which one of them confesses that he has an anger inside him that makes him want to... well, we get the idea.  The supressed anger, once unleased becomes an incoherent, arbitrary display of violence.  I just couldn't buy into it.  I know, I know, the producers had already shown that they know a lot more than we do about how a serial killer acts but I still couldn't buy into what I was seeing.  Charlie Sheen was like a lost puppy and Maxwell Caulfield was so out of control that I kept wondering how he managed to stumble through his first 18 years.

I watched this film because it was listed in the ""New York Times Guide to the Best 1000 Movies ever Made"".  It has no business being selected to that honor (and I'm been coming on more and more films in the same category).  However, I see from other reviews that many think this film is great so see for yourself.",1239408000,,2000,4.508333333333334

1409109,4,B000059PP4,"Before Penelope Spheeris's directed ""Wayne's World,"" she made another film about a pair of young men. ""The Boys Next Door,"" though, contains little of the offbeat humor that marked the Dana Carvey/Mike Meyers collaboration. You won't find subtle and not so subtle pop culture references punctuated with over the top antics in ""The Boys Next Door."" Nor will you hear a single reference to ""party on."" In a way, ""The Boys Next Door"" resembles Spheeris's other films, namely ""The Decline of Western Civilization,"" in that it looks closely at the sort of young people we don't normally see on television or in the print media. In the case of ""Decline,"" Spheeris examined the effects of punk rock music on select members of America's youth. In ""Boys Next Door,"" it's how the loss of hope leads a select few youngsters to a life of murder and mayhem. The movie, interestingly enough, begins with an error. Pictures of notorious criminals David Berkowitz, Ken Bianchi, and Ed Kemper float by in order to set a context for what we are about to see. Regrettably for the film, Berkowitz, Kemper, and Bianchi were serial killers. The two boys we meet in the movie, Roy and Bo, are spree killers. There is a big difference between the two as anyone interested in true crime stories knows.

Roy Alston (Maxwell Caulfield) and Bo Richards (Charlie Sheen) are just two of your average, everyday kids getting ready to graduate from high school. They are also the loner type, two kids who paired up with each other after the other kids excluded them from the various social circles. Both Roy and Bo are instantly recognizable high school types, at least for those of us perceptive enough to notice those around us during those painful years of compulsory schooling. They are a little rough around the edges, thanks to their miserable home lives and their relative poverty, but occasionally they make tentative overtures to others that are cruelly rebuffed. One can only feel sorry for Bo when he admires one of the prettiest girls in his class from afar, hoping against hope that he can somehow approach her and strike up a meaningful connection. Roy, the more cynical of the two, has long since reconciled himself to being an outcast, and he spends most of his time quashing any kernels of kindness popping up in Bo's mind. There's something more about Roy, something that goes beyond cynicism into the realms of downright cruelty and hatred. We first see it when he talks to a Marine recruiter on campus about joining the Corps so he can kill people. Not good. Later, of course, Roy will give full vent to his murderous rages.

After crashing a graduation party and finding themselves tossed out on the street, the two decide to cruise down to Los Angeles for a day or two for some old fashioned hijinks. Besides, getting away for a few days sounds like a good idea when the only thing they have to come back to is a couple of cruddy jobs at a local factory, jobs that will probably last a lifetime. The two barely enter the Los Angeles area when all heck breaks loose at a gas station. Roy, thinking the attendant ripped him off over two bucks in gas, beats the man to a bloody pulp. Later, at the beach, one of the boys throws a beer bottle that strikes an elderly woman on the head. Two young ladies attempt to confront the pair about the bottle, and one of them ends up taking a ride around the parking lot on the hood of Roy's car. More atrocities follow, all escalating with ferocious brutality. A gay man dies at their hands, as does an attractive young couple whose only crime involved first making eye contact with Bo and later spurning him in a video arcade. By the time Roy murders Angie (Patti D'Arbanville) while she's in the process of wooing Bo, the game is about over. Two cops, Detective Mark Woods (Christopher McDonald) and Detective Ed Hanley (Hank Garrett), have been tracking these two since the gas station heist, and a lucky break puts the boys right in their hands. Or does it?

I remember seeing ""The Boys Next Door"" back in the mid 1980s on cable. I was impressed with it then and consider it a good movie now. Aside from the misidentification of the two as serial killers, the movie still contains plenty of good performances, good dialogue, and shocking scenes. Sheen and Caulfield both carry off their respective roles convincingly, but Caulfield does the best job in the frightening role of Roy Alston. His speech about how he feels inside sends chills down the spine, as does his transformation from composed youth to shrieking beast. Oddly enough in a film larded with killings, I consider the bottle scene one of the most disturbing in the film. The look on that old lady's face when the bottle conks her on the head is so upsetting that it's not easy to forget, especially when the camera cuts back to Bo and Roy in order to show them laughing about what they did. There's just something about this scene that successfully telegraphs, just as much as the murders, the coldness of these two kids. ""The Boys Next Door"" does contain at least one unintentionally hilarious scene in the form of Detective Ed Hanley's haircut. Geez, I thought he was wearing a tricorn hat or something!

Extras on the DVD include a commentary with Spheeris and Caulfield, a trailer, and cast biographies. The picture quality looks great for a twenty year old film. I would recommend this movie to most fans of low budget cinema, but it's also got an appeal to Charlie Sheen completists (Is there such a thing? God help us!) and lovers of movies dealing with the criminal mindset.",1106006400,17,5576,4.663617886178862

1409112,5,B000059PP4,"I was 13 when I first laid my eyes on the best film ever made, Boys Next Door. Max Caufield is one of the most underated actors of all time. The role he plays in this movie should have won an oscar. He truely captured the part of a real sociopath, and take it from me, being one, it is not easy to understand the mind of a true sociopath. Being one of Charlie Sheen's less no movies also helps make it great. This movie would have never been accepted in the main steam for it's true to life violence and social misbehavior. Most people will not understand this movie, but those who do, will never forget it! It is the second most watched movie in my life, only to Beastmaster.

7934031,5,B000059PP4,"A ""classic"" in its own right--a film I first saw as a teenager, nearly 30 years ago, but most folks I talk to today have never seen--""The Boys Next Door"" makes for good, albeit shocking entertaining. It's about serial killers, bottomline, but in the form of two young men, who, at least on the surface, appear like perfectly normal 18-year-old boys. Awkward socially, outcasts in school, they celebrate their high school graduation by taking a road trip to Los Angeles and going on an impromptu killing spree. In no time, the police are hot on their trail, and their bloody fiesta reaches a devastating climax. In the end, despite their horrific crimes, you find yourself sympathizing in a way with the ""villains,"" both of whom started off simply as ""The Boys Next Door."" If you enjoyed the film ""Natural Born Killers"" and/or you're keen on the television series ""Law & Order,"" I can practically guarantee you'll enjoy this nearly forgotten gem. Either way, you might get a kick out of seeing Charlie Sheen in such in early role. Not a family flick, that's for sure, and probably not a good idea to watch before bedtime.
