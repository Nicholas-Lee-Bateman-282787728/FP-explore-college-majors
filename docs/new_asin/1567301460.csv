7796750,5,1567301460,"Reincarnation of Golden Lotus is a story about how revenge can cross centuries.

In the afterlife we meet Golden Lotus, the ""#1 Slut in ancient Chinese History."" Golden Lotus is about to cross over into the next life and needs to let her past go in order to start fresh. However, she wants revenge on the man that is responsible for her death. It so consumers her that she passes onto the next life, hellbent on getting her wish.

Centuries later, Lotus is a beautiful young woman who has a hard existence (considered a slut by many). She also has visions of her past life (although she's not aware of the link)and her past life closely mirrors the events going on in new life. Her love for Wu-Long (Driver and friend to her husband)and affair with a photographer is similar to the events in her past life. Will the events in her current existence end the same as her past?

This is a very good movie. Sexy, haunting, funny and heartbreaking. Worth a look. For those that aren't into foreign films, you REALLY should give this a look!",1185926400,4,1034,4.48936170212766
