705282,5,6303698344,"Based on a true story, Yaron Svoray (Oliver Platt) an Israeli freelance journalist goes to Germany to write an article about the rising Neo Nazi movement.  While visiting a Turkish refugee camp a gang of skinheads attack.  When the police arrive, he is mistakenly arrested which gives the skinheads the impression that he is a sympathiser for the Nazi cause. I can't see this part as being believable.  It's one thing to try and ""hang out"" with the skinheads but it's very, very unlikely that some new guy is ever going to be taken to meet people who are important to the cause.  Yaron sees the opportunity and slowly infiltrates the group.  He is appalled and disgusted by what he sees, but he's determined to dig deeper.
I found Oliver Platt to be a terrible choice for this movie.  He's sloppy looking and rather annoying.",1059091200,4,825,4.655172413793103
705283,2,6303698344,"I give this film 2 stars for a few interesting scenes. Based on the book, In Hitler's Shadow, a journal of a German-Isreali who went ""undercover"" in the Neo-Nazi movement of Germany. The book itself is a bit ridiculous, as it tells how the author, Yaron Svoray (Oliver Platt) contacted the Wiesenthal Center to ""infiltrate"" the Berlin Neo-Nazis. What we see are basically a gang of thugs beating up Turks, and in order not to ""blow his cover"" he doesn't stop them. How despicable to let your friends get beat up so you can play some useless spy game. On the other hand, he seems proud to have established a genuine friendship with a Nazi. The impression the film gives of the ""movement"" is that it's some cult, and Svoray and his cohorts laughably pretend to be Nazis, and also pretend that what they're doing has any value whatsoever, while accomplishing nothing. I don't minimize Neo-Nazis as a threat, but this film unintentionally does because it makes them look so ridiculous. The neoNazi topic begs serious content which this film lacks.",965088000,,1043,4.767955801104972
705284,4,6303698344,"Based on the true story of Yaron Svoray, an Israeli freelance reporter living in the US. ""The Infiltrator"" recounts Svoray's infiltration of Nazi-sympathizers in Germany and beyond.
Oliver Platt plays Svoray, and  does a good job in a very serious role. But Svoray's self-imposed mission,  with the cooperation and support of the Wiesenthal Center is a Bunyonesques  task, and, he is somewhat ill-equipped. If the film initially is to show us  how direct exposure to the atrocities of Nazism might fuel unbridled fire  within a person, Jewish or otherwise, then it fails in act one.
It's  exposition regarding the state of Nazism today, is important, somewhat  startling, and  much more dramatic. That a Jewish reporter could infiltrate  this infra-structure is somewhat unbelievable, but it serves to validate  Svoray's passion.
All in all, the film struggles in no-man's land between  documentary and thriller, battling to fill time between real life events.  Curiously, actor Arliss Howard takes a major role as an Israeli agent-he  will go on to play Mossad operative Peter Malkin in the bio-pic `The Man  Who Captured Eichmann (1996)"".
Svoray's story is compelling, sadly the  film gives us a less than satisfying conclusion. A worthwhile watch,  nonetheless.",950313600,,1264,5.308080808080808

Some nasty violence, but it's never really scary enough, and the lead role can't decide if it's going to be wisecracking or serious. I didn't care for this.",1233273600,,267,4.583333333333333
7852991,4,6303698344,"I just seen the movie in Max Prime, and I sure can relate to the reviewers who said that the choise of actor and weakness in the plot make this unbelievable- but lets focus on substance! neo-nazis have taken over, be it white supremacist in the US (from KK to who knows what), actual neo-puristanist at the white house or the fact that Germany is reacting to its loss at II WW.. to make matter worst, we have the perfect excuse of the terrorist act of 09/11 enforced by a patriot Act that places all powers to judicial prosecutors of whatever they consider un-patriotic..

The whole concep of a free society has been loss and we are criticizing a movie for its weak choosing of the main actor???  Am I the only one smelling the coffee??

Ok, I can hear the white supremacist saying that such films can exists because of the jewish wing that has bought congress, still, something does not add up.. I am not a religious zeaolot of islam, xchristianity or judaism (or any religion at all).. I believe in a secular state, wher freedom of thought, religion and thought are permitted acording to our western evolution ogf thought.. all of that is going down the drain and nobody seems to care.. next thing you know I will have to seek political asylum in Israel..",1179100800,,1257,4.504385964912281
