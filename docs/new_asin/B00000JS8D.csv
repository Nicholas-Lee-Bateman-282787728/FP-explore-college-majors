7913454,2,B00000JS8D,Well its OK but I was about to return the movie because it wasn't what I was wanting. I was wanting the dbz kia or the newer releases but I didn't have any stamps and due to snow  I couldn't drive out in it.,1391990400,,207,3.7045454545454546
7913455,4,B00000JS8D,"I ordered this disk back in November 2004, and I guess Amazon must have found one in their warehouse, because i bought it new from Amazon after it had been out of print for years. Anyways, these episodes aren't bad, but not great. However, I do like them better than the re-dubbed version, for some odd reason. In these 3 episodes, Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan escape some evil aliens and arrive on Namek, where they get their first glimpse of Frieza. Meanwhile, Goku prepares to leave Earth to travel to Namek. Like I said, these episodes aren't bad, but are mostly storyline and don't have much action.",1150675200,,601,4.626168224299065
