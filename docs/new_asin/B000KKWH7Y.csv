My dvd player is set for all country codes, so if someone out there has an English language copy with a non-US country code, I would buy it.",1369526400,,405,4.205128205128205

Jim Belushi also plays a casino manager and his role, like everyone else's, is just getting thru life the best he can.  The ending is rather sci-fi, and that may be a slight annoyance to those who want everything to end in a pat, black-and-white sort of way.  I absolutely loved the ending; it was very fitting.  I have waited YEARS for this to be released on DVD in the US...and I'm still waiting. Fortunately, I bought it on Laser Disc (remember those!) when it was first released.  (Locale note:  although set in Las Vegas, some of the locations are in the San Fernando Valley in California...same place(s) where Pulp Fiction was also filmed).  Won't give away which locales are in the SFV, because it is fun to believe it is all in Vegas and I don't want to spoil it for anyone.",1170115200,,886,4.432098765432099
