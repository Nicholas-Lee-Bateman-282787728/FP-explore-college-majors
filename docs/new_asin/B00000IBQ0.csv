1219369,3,B00000IBQ0,"Anyone familar with Francois Truffaut knows about his love for the films of Alfred Hitchcock. Then, it should come as no suprise to find Truffaut paying homage to the ""Master of Suspense"". Jean-Louis Trintignant is our man in questioning. He has been accused of not only the murder of his wife but also the murder of two other people. Now, he and his secretary must prove his innocence. Fanny Ardant(Truffaut's then wife) is absolutely amazing to watch. I enjoyed her performance a great deal. This movie does seem to play off like a ""real"" Hitchcock movie only it doesn't have a certain feeling to it. We know we're watching a ""forgery"" in a sense. Truffaut, for however talented he may be, can't really pull this off completely. Granted, ""Confidentially Yours"" is fun, and exciting entertainment by one of the greatest French directors of all time. It just can't really hold up to Hitchcock classics like ""Rear Window"", ""North By Northwest"", and ""The Birds"". I hate to sound like I don't like this film, because I do. I think Truffaut is a great filmmaker. A genius! And he remains as one of my favorites. This isn't really a good movie to start watching Truffaut with though. It is a good movie in general though, and is really enjoyable to watch. I do recommend this movie to everybody, especially Hitchcock and Truffaut fans, as well as foreign films fans too. An enjoyable movie by one of the finest directors that ever lived!",973209600,6,1432,4.732

7909682,4,B00000IBQ0,"""Confidentially Yours"", an homage to film noir movies, feels a good deal older than you would expect of a movie made in 1983.  I would have placed it in the middle 1960's, if I was merely guessing, and totally unfamiliar with Francois Truffaut's history.

This film does something of a spin on Hitchcockian movies like ""Notorious"", in which there is collaborative spywork between Cary Grant's and Ingrid Bergman's characters, or ""Torn Curtain"" with Paul Newman and Julie Andrews.  How it differs, and how Truffaut seems to have some directorial fun with the material, is that the lead female character (Fanny Ardant) totally carries the movie.  Lean and sensual, with an complex, intelligent face, Fanny Ardant is allowed to play a female who is dashing, at times fearless, and a good head taller than her male counterpart ( Jean- Louis Trintignant).  It is she who dons the trenchcoat and plays ""sleuth"" in this movie, while her boss (Trintignant) is under suspicion and forced to hide in his office.

Truffaut in effect seems to be creating a noir piece, albeit a lighthearted one, that reverses the sex roles and places a truly liberated woman into a genre that never really anticipated such a development.  The director even makes a joke (at Hitchcock's expense) about the elevated status given to blonde women.

The downside to the movie is that while Ardant is always fun to watch, the movie is overly ""talky"", and sometimes hard to follow.  Nevertheless it serves as a good reminder of how far the Europeans remain ahead of the game in depicting strong and complex women.",1373673600,,1578,4.902255639097745
7909683,5,B00000IBQ0,"Back in 1983 I saw a screening of at the London Film Festival that was supposed to be introduced by Francois Truffaut. On the day an apologetic Fanny Ardant turned up instead, apologizing that the director was feeling a little ill and was not up to travelling: in fact, he had just been diagnosed with the brain tumour that would kill him a few months later, and Vivemant Dimanche! aka Finally, Sunday/Confidentially Yours would turn out to be his last film. It works better on the big screen than the small, but it's still an immensely likeable little number that brings Francois Truffaut's career almost full circle to the kind of black and white semi-noir he championed as a critic. It's one of Truffaut's most purely cinematic films - while much of it is dialogue driven, there are few of the awkward literary conceits that he would resort to in some of his ""tell, don't show"" movies like Two English Girls, instead letting the character interaction and the loving black and white visuals speak for themselves. Most of all, it has a real sense of fun that even a brief melancholy reflection on the difference between death - something definite - and murder - something almost abstract - can detract from, whether it's Fanny Ardant's knocking out a suspect with a miniature Eiffel Tower, treating the fugitive Jean-Louis Trintignant to a view of her legs as she passes the window to the office he is hiding in or carrying out an investigation in wildly inappropriate attire, and there's a great joke about Paths of Glory. It goes a little over the top at the end, but by then you'll have had so much fun you'll gladly forgive it almost anything. And the last shot is a delightfully sweet and playful epitaph to a life in movies as a group of children kick a camera lens around a church during a wedding to the accompaniment of Georges Delerue's charmingly catchy music.",1248566400,,1872,4.675757575757576
7909684,5,B00000IBQ0,"Part screwball love story, part Hitchcockian detective thriller, ""Yours"" finds the leggy, buoyant Ardant, Truffaut's real-life muse and partner, playing sleuth on behalf of the man she secretly loves, and landing in a seedy, menacing world of organized crime and prostitution. Photographed in gorgeous, faux-`40s black-and-white, ""Confidentially Yours"" is an elegant, well-crafted noir brimming with Truffaut's signature sprightliness and romantic joie de vivre. Sadly, this was the great French director's final love letter to the cinema.",1183680000,,539,6.105263157894737

Although the Region 1 DVD boasts a decent transfer and the theatrical trailer, those with multi-region players might want to seek out Cinema Club's UK DVD, a better transfer with the trailer, an informative introduction by Serge Toubiana and a likeable, affectionate and informative audio commentary by Jean-Louis Tritignant recorded for the French DVD in 2001.",1167609600,4,2217,4.788511749347259
7909686,5,B00000IBQ0,"It's fitting that Francois Truffaut's final movie before his death should pay direct homage to the one director he admired above all others: Alfred Hitchcock. This is a murder mystery in the tradition of the master, right down to the little comic touches; even the love story is straight Hitchcock.

The story is too complicated to actually summarize, but it begins with a man being shot while hunting, an innocent man being accused, and his secretary helping him prove his innocence and falling in love with him at the same time. (Based on just that about a half-dozen Hitchcock films should come to mind.) Two more dead bodies show up, the chase leads to Nice and other places, and leads crop up and disappear before the real murderer is apprehended. At times the story line gets too complicated to follow, and coincidences occur left and right, but Truffaut by this point in his career was only interested in making good entertainments - and in that he succeeded admirably. Filmed in b&w. Great fun to watch.",1131494400,7,1011,4.777142857142858
7909687,5,B00000IBQ0,"This is a movie about love as only the French can tell it, about the lengths a woman will go when she is in love, even as the man (who seems unaware of her feelings for him) fires her, slaps her across the face, and insults her. Love is the motivation for everything she does. When her boss (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover Barbara (Fanny Ardant) poses as a prostitute in order to uncover the truth. This movie was shot in black and white, and it seems to have a 1950s atmosphere to it. That being said, the decision to shoot this film in black and white instead of in color seems appropriate. Not being very knowledgeable with Alfred Hitchcock's movies, I consider this as being all Truffaut. Some scenes were apparently inspired by Hitchcock but it is Truffaut who is telling the story. And it is his off-screen love (Fanny Ardant) who shines in the role of Barbara. This was Truffaut's swan song, and that song is about love conquering all, as the ending suggests. If you are a fan of either Truffaut or Fanny Ardant, or you just like a good love story, then this movie is for you.",1106956800,6,1131,4.4423076923076925
7909688,5,B00000IBQ0,"This movie was a holy grail of sorts for me when I first saw it years ago in Berlin at a Truffaut retrospective.  In German, it is titled ""Auf Liebe und Tod"" (""Of Love and Death"").  I asked the ticket taker what it was called in the original, and she didn't know.  Being in the days before the www, I finally found out it was called ""Vivement Dimanche!"" in French (""I Eagerly Awaiting Sunday to Come"").  It took me another year before I traced its English title, ""Confidentially Yours.""  Isn't it amazing how these widely divergent titles reflect their languages and cultures?

Well, then years later, the wait became trying to find a VHS to rent, then later I pensively waited for the DVD release.  But, now I have the DVD, and couldn't be happier!

Of course, the DVD doesn't have many ""extras,"" but since I don't buy DVDs for extras, it's no big deal.  The subtitles by Laurent Bouzereau, however, are excellent, and at least faithful to my memory of the German dubbing (speaking no French, I suppose this means the German dubbing was also faithful), and in much more a sophisticated vernacular than the old VHS I saw.

As with ""The Bride Wore Black,"" ""Confidentially Yours"" is Truffaut's overt hommage to the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.  Unlike ""bride,"" though, there's no Bernard Herrmann score, but not to worry!  French composer and Truffaut favourite Georges Delerue (""The 400 Blows,"" ""Jules and Jim,"" ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"") conjures a dark soundtrack worthy not only of Herrmann, but hearkens back to Max Steiner, Miklos Roscza and Franz Waxman with his forboding themes on the lower strings.

Actually, although ""Confidentially Yours"" is inspired by Hitch, it is also a tribute to the great film noirs of the 1940s, and even has an element of screwball comedy about it.  Jean-Louis Trintignant stars as the luckless Vercel, a small-time realtor in Southern France who's been framed for murder.  So, like Hitch's man on the run, Vercel must hide out while Gal Friday Barbara, played with sophisticated wit, sexiness and charm by Fanny Ardant (who bears an eerie resemblance both to Geena Davis and Patricia Neal), who sets about proving his innocence.  Of course, Vercel's fate only sinks further as two more murders are attributed to him as he eludes the cops.

Through a series of twists and double-crosses that are more out of Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep"" than Hitchcock, Ardant eventually gets Trintignant off the hook, and in the process discovers -- voila! -- she's been in love with her rather abrasive boss all along.

""Confidentially Yours"" is a fitting denouement for Truffaut:  A neat and tidy bundle of murder, betrayal, revenge, love and lust in a lighthearted vein.  Francois, you left us too soon!",1030492800,20,2732,4.872294372294372
7909689,4,B00000IBQ0,"The late Francois Truffaut was one of the inventors and purveyors of French New Wave cinema. He was also an ardent admirer of Alfred Hitchcock. In ""CONFIDENTIALLY YOURS,"" Truffaut's last film, he deftly pays homage to Sir Alfred and displays the signature cinematic style he so loved in a noirish tale of love and murder.
The witty screenplay, adapted by Truffaut and Suzanne Schiffman, is based on American Charles William's novel, ""The Long Saturday Night"" but relocated to a small town in the South of France.
The premise is simple. Vercel (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is a luckless businessman who is under suspicion for murdering his wife and her lover. His smart and beautiful secretary Barbara (Fanny Ardent), who is hopelessly in love with her boss, tries to solve the murder and prove his innocence while Varcel hides in his office and then is on the lam.
The beauty of this elegant and intelligent film is in the role reversals that make the familiar territory a brand new landscape. The sentimentality that permeates almost every scene is never allowed to soften the unexpected, and sometimes cutting, dark humor.

Enough can't be said about Ardent's charismatic charm. The camera loves her, and so did Truffaut -- she was his real life paramour during the making of this film. In many scenes, she literally seems to glow. For many videophiles, she is the primary reason to watch this delightful gem. It is certainly among Truffaut's very best films.
The crisp, striking black and white cinematography is by N&eacute;stor Almendros (""Two English Girls"").",1022025600,14,1561,5.050387596899225
