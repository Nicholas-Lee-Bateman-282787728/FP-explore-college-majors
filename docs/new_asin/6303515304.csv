678449,2,6303515304,"I must admit...I saw the original series...
I am REALLY baffled by this movie. The show was kind of fun and goofy, but not very good and here, Lynch just goes out and makes some movie because he feels his fans  ""deserve it"".
Ok.
This movie basically is going to have you  scratching your head. Or banging it on the wall, which ever comes first.  Even fans of the show say you learn nothing new.
And all David Lynch  seems to do is confuse you even MORE. Damn, I mean what the heck is that  squiggely-floored room with the red drapes? Huh? And the horribly  unintentionally funny scenes with that dude who's name was Arm who sounded  like an Indian who walked around for no reason, talking to other freaks  that was something out of Eraserhead? And the really BADLY edited scenes  with Chris Isaak and David Bowie...? And where did THEY go? They  disappeared after the first reel!!! Probably didn't want to be in this  movie anymore after seeing their scenes in the editing room. And who can  blame them? Poor Sheryl Lee cries in almost every scene she's in. Probably  was under contract for this movie and couldn't get out.
At times, there  were scenes that didn't even belong here! The horse...? Ok! Whatever! And  where was Heather Graham? Madchen Amick? I looked backwards and forwards  for them, finding Amick getting hit by her boyfriend! What? Was Graham in  the background waving at the camera?
With really bad dialogue such as  ""I am as blank as a fart"" and the usual Lynch confusion such as  the phantom white horse that was borrowed from the set of Blade Runner and  the really stupid red room with Laura's father levitating for no reason  other than to look real kewl for the kiddies...
Don't wait for video,  folks. Wait for T.V.!!!

Not quite the same as the TV show, but a wealth of information can be learned for those who have watched the entire series first. Excellent cinematography and haunting music.

678589,5,6303515304,"I recently wrote an essay length review of the new twin peaks series which i loved. I then did an edit of the essay and amazon seems to not allow this. I am figuring it was prob due to length restrictions so i will cover a few main points i wanted to stress in my last review.
THE MAIN POINT OF MY TWIN PEAKS REVIEWS ARE THAT DAVID LYNCHES TWIN PEAKS IS THE FOLLOWING: 1.the few episodes he directed from the original series. 2. Twin Peaks Fire Walk w me movie+missing pieces, 3. The new event series. 4. The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer --book by lynches daughter.
There is a main absurd confusion with twin peaks that mirrors the main theme of absurdity the show encompass making the end result artistically acceptable to serious artist as well as a mainstream audience that has problems thinking in an abstract or mindful way. What i mean by this is Twin Peaks from a macro view is not  David Lynch project.
Lynch made Fire Walk with Me --as originally an attempt to apologize for abandoning the tv show to concentrate on Wild at Heart.
Fire walk with me would of been how the tv show looked and felt if it was a David lynch project which it was not and for a total auture like Lynch he has to be in full control--another example would be Dune--it's not fully a Lynch movie therefore its's not talked about as being of full Lynch quality.
I could write a novella about this film but will try to keep it very short.--I first viewed this film when i was in my late teens and was familiar with most of Lynches work up to that point. My first reaction was i loved about 65% of it even admitting the parts i loved were brilliant but i did not understand Lee's performance. .I at the time did not understand over the top acting the way Lynch uses it. I also did not quite get Lynch dialogue.
Lynch has his own linguistics---This film has one of the best obvious keys to unlocking the understanding of this. The scene where-sheryl lee --says--""it's like a turkey in the corn--gobble gobble-- This scene explains so much about lynch that its can be analyzed for structure importance
. This scene has great cinematography- and a dramatic feel besides one element being out of place. That element is the dialogue. Lynch is saying he in this scene to pay attention to many elements of a moving picture and to not concentrate on one thing. Lee's whole performance is a type of style that mimic's movie theatrics. Lynch uses a high school girl as a stereotype to probe into the human condition. Twin Peaks--or Lynches twin peaks is NOT ABOUT LAURA PALMER OR AGENT COOPER.
This is what divides the audience into 2 types of Twin Peaks fans who experience it in different ways and brilliantly in this case it works.
Anyone that compares the original tv show to any of the Lynch stuff that came afterword is like tackling a contradiction. The critic that compares the series which was like 20% directed by Lynch is auto negating themselves. Twin Peaks is very simple. It is a meditation experiment that delves into the classic philosophical questions while using a Edward Hopperesqueamericana/nightmare/beautiful/ absurd landscape and socioeconomic climate of this small town.
This film really is probably Lynches most high octane and heavily experimental next to Inland Empire.
I went from liking it but thinking of it as flawed, to 15 years later changing my mind to think it as a masterpiece.
The reaction to the film at Cannes in a good study of what happens when a real artist tries to mingle with a mainstream audience.
 Lynch was accused of ""killing twin peaks"" at Cannes when in reality he was doing twin peaks the right way or the way it should of been done.
What happened with this films release should be studied in psychology classes. Even at Cannes the audience was in such a trance cause by the pop phenomenon high- that they could not process what they were seeing.
 Because of this reaction alone this film is legendary. I absolutely love this film. It is like lynch gone wild. I have watched this Lynch film probably more than any other-- My other 2 most fav's are Blue Velvet and Inland Empire. I will end this review for now and finish it later--cheers",1517702400,3,4157,4.54739652870494

But I would have loved to see more commentaries, more interviews, maybe even media from 1992 about the movie.

678694,4,6303515304,"Twin Peaks it ain't. Get ready for F-bombs, nudity, and domestic violence aplenty. Once the shock wears off you'll find yourself watching a very divisive movie. Those fans of Twin Peaks who enjoyed it for the weird and surreal trips to the Black Lodge will find a lot to love in this film, but noticeably missing from this film is the witty charm of Dale Cooper, Sheriff Truman, and Pete Martell. This film is DARK! You'll feel gross after watching it, but that doesn't mean it's bad.

Its depictions of domestic abuse are intense and well handled, showing the audience a lot of the motivations behind Laura Palmer's darker side. There are many genuinely frightening scenes, and the surreal moments are some of the more memorable images from the series. The film opens with a great sequence outside of Twin Peaks where we learn a little more about the larger mystery and how the FBI is involved in hunting BOB before Coop ever visits Twin Peaks.

It should also be mentioned that there are noticeable absences in this movie. Kyle McLachlan was feeling burned by the way Season 2 went, and had to be convinced to appear in the movie. There is a part early on (you'll know which one) which was originally meant to be Cooper, but McLachlan wanted a smaller role. However, the most notable absence is Lara Flynn Boyle who played Donna Hayward, Laura's best friend. She flat refused to join the movie about Laura's final days, and as a result her role was recast. Moira Kelly does a solid job in the role, but it's hard to buy that it's even the same character. Part of me likes this version of Donna better than the one she transformed into in Season 2, but it still feels very strange watching everyone treat this totally different person like she's Donna. I definitely think the movie suffers from the casting issues, but it's something that is not difficult to look over.

So should you watch this film? Well, that's difficult to answer. I don't think general audiences will enjoy this one, but if you enjoyed the darker and more surreal elements from the original run you will probably like this movie. It offers frustratingly few answers about the many mysteries surrounding the original show, but it does provide context which can change any further viewings of the original run. Furthermore, if you plan to watch Twin Peaks: The Return you will need to watch this film. There are many references to characters and mythos elements established in this film which you'll miss, and given how dense and uncompromising TP: The Return is you don't want to miss a thing.

So in closing, I really liked this movie, but it's certainly got its flaws, and it barely feels like Twin Peaks. Watch at your own discretion, and I hope you'll enjoy it.",1513555200,6,2737,4.672199170124482

678699,5,6303515304,"One of Lynch's more interesting late-era efforts, much maligned for its narrative dissonance, upon repeated viewings this is a surprisingly straightforward film. Along with Eraserhead and The Elephant Man, it is certainly among his bleakest efforts. The sound design and music are superb, and Sheryl Lee's performance is unquestionably the highlight here. This Criterion release includes the much sought after ""Deleted Scenes"" previously only available on an expensive Blu Ray set, which helps add a bit of levity to these dark proceedings, and greatly expands the mythology, laying much of the groundwork for Twin Peaks: The Return. Fascinating, essential viewing for Twin Peaks and Lynch fans alike.",1512432000,2,701,5.5607476635514015
678700,5,6303515304,"Ever since Twin Peaks director David Lynch decided to flesh out the backstory of murder victim, Laura Palmer, in his 1992 follow-up movie, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, viewers seem to be split into two camps, with one praising the film as a masterpiece, and the second decrying it as a foul blemish on an unforgettable TV series. Beginning with its unveiling at the Cannes Film Festival, FWWM continues to polarize critics and audiences alike, with very few having neutral feelings about it. Fans of the original TV series were disappointed because the movie didn't maintain the spirit of the original, and those new to the world of Twin Peaks were baffled and, largely, lost in Lynchs weird, unnerving prequel. If you are a fan of the original series and haven't yet seen this movie, I think its advisable to be forewarned that FWWM takes a very dark journey with a very different tone than Twin Peaks did, with none of the humor or warm folksiness that previously leavened the tragic, scary events unfolding in the town. Beginning a year prior to events in the TV show, FWWM opens with an FBI investigation into the murder of a teenage prostitute, which eventually overlaps into the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer. In between the investigation and Lauras murder, reality blurs with the surreal and the supernatural, as Lauras double life (by day: All-American high school sweetheart; by night: prostitute, cokehead, underworld moll) begins to unravel, dragging her deeper and deeper into an abyss of terror and despair. And its that unrelenting terror and despair that really sets the tone for the movie: Lauras journey is bleak, as are the journeys of most of the characters in this film. Some come and go, basically in cameos, with no apparent purpose other than to reprise their roles from the series. Others simply disappear, seemingly into thin air, with ominous hints at their fates. And then theres David Bowie, briefly materializing as a long-missing FBI agent who delivers a mysterious warning before permanently dematerializing from the film.

The main character in FWWM, of course, is Laura Palmer, played by gorgeous and talented, Sheryl Lee, reprising, and giving life to, her role as the mostly-dead homecoming queen who washed up on the banks of a lake next to Pete Martells house in the series first episode. Lee was briefly able to emote in the TV show, not as Laura, but as her look-alike cousin, Maddie Ferguson, who was also brutally dispatched after a few episodes. In FWWM, Lee gives an amazing performance as the tormented Laura, the eternal victim, whose degradation and abuse takes her below the tranquil, happy surface of the town of Twin Peaks. In virtually every scene shes in, Lee is awesome. She is, by turns, touching, maddening, seductive and heartbreaking as she tackles the role of the enigmatic, doomed anti-heroine. Kyle MacLachlan returns as Special Agent Dale Cooper, but only briefly, as the events of the film transpire before those in the series (and before Cooper was much involved). The head FBI agent in FWWM is well- played by singer, Chris Isaak, who at first seems to be the hero of the piece, an assumption quickly dismissed about 45 minutes into the movie. David Lynch, himself, has a couple of brief, funny scenes (the only humorous moments in the movie) as Isaaks and Coopers boss, and David Bowie is properly strange and alarming. The rest of the cast is also very good in their allotted time onscreen, and we get to see a more fleshed-out version of Ronette Pulaski, (returning Phoebe Augustine), another high school prostitute and cohort of Laura, who accompanies her on her ill-fated trip into the deep, dark woods. Having grown used to Lara Flynn Boyle playing Donna (Lauras best friend) in the TV show, its a little disconcerting to watch Moira Kelly taking on the role in the movie. Kelly is fine, but different, which is pretty much an accurate summation of the film. I like it, I think its excellent, but it is different from what I was used to seeing on the TV show.

The Criterion release 4K digital transfer is newly awash in heightened, beautiful colors and the sound is much clearer than on the previous DVD release. At times, scenes exhibit the allure of a masters painting (although a painting by Bosch, maybe). The extras include deleted scenes, interviews with Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise (who played her cheerfully sinister father) and Grace Zabriskie (Lauras high-strung, in-denial mom), trailers for the film, and a great booklet featuring an interview with David Lynch.

If you haven't seen the movie and never saw the TV show, I think its necessary to watch the series first just to understand the events in the film, because Lynch assumes that moviegoers are already familiar with many of the characters, their motivations and their fates. When you do watch the film, leave behind any assumptions that it will be a mystery with darkly comic overtones like the TV show. Fire Walk With Me is a dark horror story that stirs up emotions and, for better or for worse, remains with the viewer after it ends.",1512345600,10,5086,4.8436781609195405

Kermode has the guts of saying that the film even has great acting when it simply doesn't. The acting in the film is horrible, overacting abound.

I have both Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive on Criterion Blu - there are very few directors I double dip for but Lynch is definitely one of them along with Kubrick and Wes Anderson.
The FWWM I currently own is the one that comes with Twin Peaks The Entire Mystery on Blu-ray (region free import) and although I am sure it's the same transfer I'm excited to get the Criterion Edition nonetheless as a Lynch enthusiast and Criterion collector.
I sincerely hope that Criterion releases ALL the David Lynch films - The Elephant Man, Dune, Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Lost Highway, Inland Empire and The Straight Story as well as releases On The Air.

I have all the films on blu already many as imports - Elephant Man is StudioCanel, Lost Highway and Inland Empire are German releases... They're all good - excellent quality, superior picture and sound to the DVD's but not exactly Criterion.
Although I highly doubt it I hope that Criterion would also obtain the rights to Twin Peaks The Return and cut out the intro credits to each episode which would intern make it an 18 hour film - Fire Walk With Me is essential to understanding and connecting both the original 2 Season series and the Showtime 3rd Season.

If you are watching Twin Peaks the Return I very much hope you either have already seen FWWM or will go back and watch it when Season 3 is completed on Showtime. It's definitive Lynch Lore and a must for Twin Peaks/Lynch fans and key to understanding the entire Twin Peaks canon... This is one to get for sure. It has most of the same Special Features as the version that comes with The Entire Mystery but I'm eager to see how it is treated by Criterion and compare the two. I'm hopeful the Criterion Edition is superior in color nuances not that the box set version is bad at all but for Lynch aficionados we want the best there is of David Lynch's work - the Criterion edition of Eraserhead, (2nd Printing) is wonderful - and the 2nd Printing is a must as the 1st Printing has a flaw... Mulholland Drive superb on Criterion as well and I am hoping that either Lost Highway or Blue Velvet will be on Criterion next but it'll probably be Wild At Heart.

You have to let him guide you and you'll be rewarded. This may not be his best movie, but it's still a wonderful piece of cinema. Dirty, mind-bending, disturbing, terrifying, fascinating. Lynch is a genius and a visionary, a true artist.

678956,3,6303515304,I don't quite understand parts of this movie. In the beginning when they showed all the fbi agents agent Cooper Gordon Cole and then about ten minutes of guest stars such as keifer Sutherland Chris issak and about three minutes of David bowie. All of these scenes seemed to really have no purpose other than to show that they were already looking for a murderer. It was different to see Laura Palmer as a live character. She was great in the role. Noticeably absent was Lara Flynn Boyle as Donna Hayward. Laura's life was miserable and the things she did were seedy and horrible. She went through pure hell every day and you don't really get to know all the details of her life in the show. Some of the characters from the show seemed to be just thrown in but don't really have a purpose . They show Shelley Johnson and norma Jennings but they weren't really necessary in the plot even though I do love thier characters on twin peaks. Bob is just terrifying. I don't remember his real name but no one could've played that role but him. Also her father Leland Palmer was much darker in this. Everything on this movie is much darker than the twin peaks series. It is also very sleazy . It shows nudity and drug use and has alot of cussing whereas the show had almost none of the above but it did air on network tv. Overall I'm glad I watched the movie .I may just watch it again and then perhaps it will make more sense to me because it didn't . I was thinking it would be different. It didn't answer any questions the show left open for me .i cant wait until i can see the new showtime series i hope it is not a disappointment.

679021,4,6303515304,"This movie really retains the sting of the 48-hour blend! But it may not be
every Twin Peaks fan's idea of a great cup of Good Morning America, even
25 years odd after its initial (troubled) theatrical release. Everyone forgets
though, that the prequel saw release at least two years after the end
of the tv series, which is a long time between show and prequel film.
It was a long time to expect flighty fans to wait, and the end result
was compelling but dark and much different than the original show.
But it filled in some blanks. Sort of. A longer version that reflected
Lynch's original vision with more orig. characters might've been superior,
but then, it might not have been as intense. There are times when
this movie seems to be veering into awfulness territory, but on the
other hand, it's mainly weirdly compelling and never really boring.

Well, having watched this again 2x the past month, after not having
seen it in its entirety since 1992, mainly, Fire Walk With Me is a powerful
prequel but it diverged greatly from the tone of the original show, that's for sure,
do NOT expect the zany lighter-edged tone of much of the original series here.
This is a rough go. I still enjoy the opening sections much more, really, than the
remainder of the Laura storyline, somehow. Lynch and Agents Desmond
and Stanley just kill me. Plus Harry Dean Stanton almost steals the movie. And Lil
and her ""sour face"" and blue rose.  And Bowie as the ""phantom"" of long-lost
in the Dark Netherworld/Black Lodge Agent Phillip Jeffries is really bizarre. ""We're not gonna talk
about Judy...we're not gonna talk about Judy at all in fact we're gonna leave

She is letting herself be controlled by her feelings and fears, and spiraling into a downward nightmare as the movie progresses. The movie does not hold back on showing how far she goes, but thankfully the surreal horror has a role in the film, especially during the scene with the painting on the wall. That was my favorite scene in this nice compliment to the Twin Peaks series.

in the television series it self you don't really know much about Laura except from the stories told by those who were close to her. you also get see her terrifying moments before her death. if you take what you learn from both this movie and the secret diary of Laura Palmer you can kinda paint a picture of what kind of person Laura was prior to her death.

679736,4,6303515304,"As a new fan of the TV series, I thought it was pretty decent. It was very refreshing to see some new characters at the start (including Kiefer Sutherland and David Bowie). I confess I found myself far more interested in those early events than the bulk of the film. They are interesting, mysterious, weird, and everything that makes Twin Peaks what it is for me as a fan.

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie felt like a rehash for me. They spent the entirety of it covering Laura Palmer's last days. And while it was great to get some more Sheryl Lee, I felt like this was ground we'd already covered a hundred times over in the series: Laura was not so innocent. Over the course of the film, we're shown her crazy antics, drug use, desperation, and suffering. But little of this is news to us as viewers. We've heard most and seen some of this already in the main series. The biggest difference is how R-rated the film gets to be free of network control and constraints. Nudity, drug use, violence, and sexual situations permeate the film. This makes total sense given Laura's wild life, but it can shock some viewers more accustomed to the toned down nature of the TV series.

For me, the best parts were about the supernatural mythology of FWWM. I liked seeing the Black Lodge and all its inhabitants again (even BOB). Unfortunately, the film is woefully short on the show's main character, Cooper. Seems like that was down to some sort of dispute with the actor at the time of filming, but as a fan I was pretty disappointed we only got about five minutes total of the MAIN CHARACTER in this ENTIRE FILM.

A few words to the wise, if you have not seen the series you will have no idea whats going on in the movie, characters are not explained and lots of references will be lost on you. Also before seeing FWWM, I would highly recommend reading The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer written by Lynch's daughter, as it also fills the gap between the series and the movie. It is a super quick read, you could probably get it read in 2 days. It was meant to be read during the second season of the series. With that being said, the only things that bothered me were the continuity errors, more so between the diary and the movie. I won't list them because of spoilers and also not to be the kill joy, as these errors could be not noticed or are explainable, this is why so many theories  pop up with fans, because of the errors between the show/book/movie. The diary ( which was inline with the show) had a different tone then the movie, also the movie shows Leland a lot differently than the series portrayed him, he comes across as a tortured soul whos all actions are influenced by bob, more so than the series characters which seems to be normal Leland then all of a sudden BOB Leland.

My wife and I recently discovered it and quickly became engrossed with the strange world of Twin Peaks. Like Lost, which is the obvious intertextual reference point for my generation, or even Arrested Development, the show never really lived up to the promise of it's earliest episodes. Bizarre characters and weird non sequiturs that were charming in early episodes eventually wear thin as they are repeated throughout the series. The end goes to such a strange place that it makes you forget about some of the tedium getting there and actually makes you hungry for more.

So then we watched this film, having been warned by online reviews of what to expect. Is this a masterpiece? No. Is it worth watching for fans of the show? Probably? It does help to straighten out some of the events leading up to the show and adds a few new wrinkles, but as a standalone film it is a complete mess. If you haven't already watched the show, this movie will spoil it's biggest mystery. If you are a fan of the show, the film doesn't offer much beyond an R-rated view of scenes that were probably better left to the audience's imagination. While I'd probably re-watch the first season of the show at some point, I don't see myself returning to this film (unless someone convinces me the deleted scenes from the new BluRay set are really worth spending the $$$ on).",1451088000,2,1652,5.164179104477612

Here, the characters are a lot more mysterious and dark, and the plot is more complex. At times, the plot is hard to follow, but at least the viewer knows that there's a mystery to solve. This movie offers objects of interest, much in the manner of a later movie (Mulholland Dr.), in order to try to piece things together. This movie is sort of hypnotic in its approach and delivery; Laura Palmer is thrust into a strange world, taking the audience with her. Overall, this is vintage David Lynch at work; a movie that begs for answers to strange happenings. I must say that the critics were harsh with their ratings of this movie, as it's certainly way better than the panning it took.  I recommend this underrated movie.",1440201600,4,874,4.428571428571429

In the TV series, Twin Peaks mixes serious scenes with town folk wackiness. Strip out the goofy townies and pointless subplots and you are left with a very-appropriately R-rated story. FWWM is an extremely raw glimpse, which spares no ugliness, into the life of Laura Palmer. The movie evokes the sad realization that Laura's life isn't so different from many sons and daughters you might know only on the cheerful, smiling, and unsuspecting surface. Lynch is known for surreal, but FWWM feels very real.",1437177600,5,760,4.765151515151516

Years went by and for some reason I missed out on Fire Walk With Me when it was first released, I bought season 1 of the show in 2002 but season 2 was not released for some years later so I found out about FWWM.  WOW!!  It's lacking the humor of the show but it has all the surreal and disturbing type things you'd expect from David Lynch.  Ray Wise and Sheryl Lee really steal the movie, Kyle MacLachlin wasn't in it too much but we did have Chris Issak for some reason.  The movie really is a good way to finish off the Laura Palmer case before diving into the mysteries of the Black Lodge and the Waiting Room.

680267,4,6303515304,"Possible spoiler.  Having just watched the 29 episodes of the TV show, including the pilot, I had to watch this prequel again, this time on DVD.  When the second season ended and the show wasn't renewed, director, writer and creator David Lynch wanted to develop a stand-alone movie focusing on Laura Palmer's last week before her murder, which opened the series in 1990.  Lynch's producing partner, Mark Frost baled on the project as did several of the actors from the series, including Sherilyn Fenn and Lara Flynn Boyle.  Boyle's role of Laura's best friend Donna was key to the film, so she was replaced by Moira Kelly.

The first 33 minutes of the 134 minute film takes place a year earlier where the murder of Teresa Banks in Deer Meadow, WA is investigated by FBI agents Chet Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland).  Frankly, this early section is probably unnecessary but does set the backstory often referenced during the TV show.  It was the first murder determined to have been committed by the mysterious Bob.  Kyle MacLachlan also returns as Special Agent Dale Cooper, the lead in the TV series.  Here he does little more than a cameo showing up in Deer Meadow after Desmond disappears and later in some of the dream sequences.

The story picks up a year later in Twin Peaks, with Laura (Sheryl Lee) being tormented by a cocaine addiction, fueled by prostitution at a Canadian sex club.  And then, there is the sexual abuse (real or imagined) by the aforementioned Bob, who of course is the alter ego to someone close in her life.  ""Fire Walk With Me"" is much different in tone than the TV series.  To some extent, that would be expected given the restrictions of network TV.  This film has sex, nudity and language averted originally.  And while there are mystical sequences not unlike the quirky TV show, nearly all of the humor is gone.  No coffee and donuts.  No Deputy Andy and Lucy.  No Great Northern Lodge.

The story is a grim one and is all about Laura.  Here we get to see Ms. Lee at her best.  As an actress she was mostly sidelined in the TV series, appearing as Laura in dream sequences and as Laura's cousin Maddy Ferguson.  I was always impressed with Lara Flynn Boyle in the TV series but perhaps Lee was the best of the lot.  ""Fire Walk With Me"" works as a stand-alone movie, but if you have any intention on watching the `90-'91 TV series, you will want to watch this prequel last or at least until after you learn who killed Laura Palmer (episode 15 or 16).  It clears up much but not everything.",1435536000,2,2548,4.561674008810573

I really don't understand why the music is always so loud. Watch this when you can control the volume or no one else in around to bother them with the loud music and screams etc
Just as interestingly weird as the tv show for me though. I found out about the movie half way thru the second and last season of twin peaks, so thought Id take a break from the show and watch this.

I am a big David Lynch fan after seeing Lost Highway but I just recently watched this. I love the quirky and whimsical elements he brings to films. The mystery he creates usually leads to me watching his movies more than once. He really knows how to provoke thought and hold interest while slowing revealing to the viewer certain clues. He also leaves a lot to the viewer to infer.

If you're familiar with the Twin Peaks mythos, it answers some questions from the TV series but raises others. David Lynch got realllly David Lynch in this film. It's not disturbing in a graphic blood-and-gore kind of way (much), but in a way that makes it stick with you. Sheryl Lee makes Laura's mental state really hit home - the anguish of a girl trying to cope with her father's molestation, trying to take back control of her body and her sexuality the only way she sees possible. The fantastical element of BOB is almost a distractor; this could be the story of any victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a parent. (If you hadn't watched the TV series, you could argue that she invents Bob as a coping mechanism.)

(Does it irritate anyone else that the headlined actors start with Kyle McLaughlin and David Bowie and don't include Sheryl Lee at all? The men appeared for maybe fifteen minutes combined, and still they get listed ahead of the only reason this movie is worth watching.)

680357,3,6303515304,"I was a fan of the original TV series and watched FWWM when it first came out. It was okay. And now with all the buzz going around the internet about a cable only revival of the show I watched the original series on the Internet and just finished rewarching TP:FWWM.  Sad to say, I was again disappointed.  Twin Peaks was at its best when on network TV, not on the big screen.  David Lynch had to much more creative in crafting his Twin Peaks universe for network television.  Implied depravity is far more effective when telling a story than blasting it out in front of the audience and leaving nothing to the imagination as what happened in FWWM.  I fear that if the cable network revival is produced Lynch's depiction of depraved sexual violence will make FWWM look like a Disney princess movie.

In a way it seemed like FWWM was parts of three movies cobbled together to make a single movie. It was disjointed.  Had Lynch concentrated on more coherent storytelling than on the graphic depiction of depraved sexual violence and nudity and more on coherent story telling FWWM could have been much better.  The scene of Cooper and the doppelgnger at the FBI office could have been expanded upon. The Annie story line made no sense.  It was just stuck in there. And the plot just rolled on to another point.
It was disjointed. Like my review.

The acting in FWWM was excellent, and Moria Kelly's Donna Hayward was a much more sympathetic portrayal than Lara Flynn Boyle's portrayal of Donna.",1431302400,10,1491,4.613636363636363

I saw Twin Peaks - Fire Walk With Me (1992) in the theater when it came out.  The reason I wanted to see it was because Moira Kelly is in it.  I didn't know what it was about and had no idea what was transpiring on the screen.  It was a very weird movie with some pretty intense scenes.  In the decades since I've seen more David Lynch movies and now understand why it was so weird - it's because Lynch makes weird, surreal kind of movies (think Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive).  I haven't seen this movie since that night in the theater in 1992, but I plan to see it again soon so I can take it in more than I did the first time.",1430006400,,750,4.061224489795919

Now as for the German Import Blu-ray, it's excellent for those of us who can only find a US version of the DVD... I already have that, but I'm trying to build a collection of my favorite movies on Blu-ray.  It plays just fine without any worry about what region (it's ABC so it doesn't matter).  The only issue is the default audio track is the German, so make sure to switch to audio track 2 if you want to hear the original English.  Alas the subtitles are only in German so for those of us that like to see the dialog as well as hear it, no English CC so we're out of luck there.

Seeing this again at such high quality just intensifies every good feeling about it.  Sheryl Lee and Moira Kelly make your heart ache... Harry Dean Stanton cracks me up every time... and all that beautiful, beautiful, lovely scenery makes me a little homesick for similar places I've lived.  I could go on but you get the idea.  It's fantastic.

The transfer looks good, it's such a scenic movie and all the greenery is fantastic... but so are the darker scenes such as the dance hall that's flooded with red light.  You'll begin to notice details you might not have seen before.  I always get such joy in improving formats in the sense that we get closer to the original theatrical quality each time... so it's like seeing it for the first time again.  Wonderful.

Definitely recommended for fans anywhere who want a Blu-ray copy of this.  It took a bit over 2 weeks to arrive (which surprised me since I'm only on the East Coast of the US and Germany isn't that far... I've had items arrive faster from China) but it's definitely worth the wait (unlike that item from China ;).",1427673600,3,1825,4.392857142857143

As someone else wrote, if you watched the series, you don't learn anything new, and if you didn't watch the series, it is a not very comprehensible story about a psychopathic murderer. The film (a prequel to the series) totally lacks the humor style atmosphere and suspense which marks the series. The acting is very good, but that doesn't help. Agent Cooper is only in it for about 5 minutes out of 2 hours by the way, Sheriff Truman and his department are not there, and nor is the Horne family at the Great Northern. It's mostly about Laura Palmer's last few days of life (which everybody who has seen the series had already pictured in their head). Putting it on screen doesn't add much, and there are some inconsistencies (for example, in the film Donna goes to One Eyed Jack's with Laura when in the series she didn't know about that aspect of Laura's life). All a bit pointless really. I don't know why David Lynch made this film.",1421020800,2,1038,4.497354497354498

I read a few other reviews about this prequel film, and I wanted and expected something completely different -- more like the original series.

Truly, that was something unique and fun, a mystery/soap/thriller/comedy/romance/noir. But this movie, that shows what happened in the story before the TV show began, is simply dreck, and adds nothing to the unique series.

A few of the many characters from the show ""Twin Peaks"" were included, and a couple of familiar actors (not seen in the TV program) show up for the first quarter of the movie, and we know that this film is supposed to be part of the entire story .... but the whole experience of ""Fire Walk with Me"" feels false, as if someone else was creating a lurid combo epilogue/prequel for the television series. It left me feeling empty and bored.

The worst part is that the idea of this movie had so much promise and so many possibilities: the TV series had introduced the viewers to such a rich world of bizarre places (such as a comfy All American diner and a sinister supernatural hideout) and fascinating people (teens who seem from the 1950's, a vicious and deranged murderer, a drop-dead gorgeous former nun) ... there's so much to mine from, so much potential for a film that could fill in some gaps or show the fans something new. What a waste.

The regret is washing over me like the waterfalls at the Great Northern Hotel.",1404345600,5,1377,4.612244897959184
680543,1,6303515304,"Fire Walk with Me is not a movie intended for fans of the Twin Peaks series; it offers no closure, no new story development, and none of the quirky charm of the series.

Anyone thinking of purchasing this movie should know, already, that it is primarily a prequel, with only fleeting references to the finale of the series; this is not a problem. The problem is that the film does not, beyond its first half-hour, offer anything that has not already been tirelessly tread in the series itself: we already know the identity of Laura's murderer, the circumstances of her death, and her connection with Twin Peaks' seedier residents. The only thing that this film offers that the series did not is an R rating. Gone is the quirky, cheerful attitude; gone are most of the good, redeeming characters; and gone is the tactful handling of a terrible tragedy; all of these are replaced by, quite frankly, an indulgent and mildly pornographic look at the last week of Laura Palmer's life, with an overwhelming and crushing despair throughout.

I would gladly display the Twin Peaks series in my video collection, but this prequel went straight from my DVD player to my waste bin; it is simply not comparable to the series.",1403308800,6,1213,4.7440758293838865

It seemed to end on a cliffhanger, not surprising since it wasn't picked up for a third season, so Lynch had no opportunity to tie up the loose ends of the ""Windom Earle"" story, and bring the series to a coherent conclusion.

""Fire Walk with Me,"" for some reason, is a prequel. It answers nothing that wasn't apparent from the TV show's first season, and gives no hint of events after the second season. We get to see most of the characters again, some in cameo or bit parts, with a few notable absences, and a different actress playing Donna. The plot is trivial, not much more than a vehicle for Lynch to explore the depravity and criminality lurking just beneath the surface of what appears to be a wholesome small town, in a poor reprise of the far superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Velvet/dp/B003U74NQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Velvet</a>.

I have seen several versions on home video and this import blows them all out of the water. Would love to see Criterion get the license to release this here in the states (among many other Lynch films) and include Lynch interviews and the ""ever wanted"" deleted scenes among other great special features Criterion is known for.

680571,4,6303515304,"If you have seen the ENTIRE Twin Peaks television series, you MUST watch this film. It serves as a prequel AND epilogue / finale to the series. While many of the events take place a week (and less) before the events in the pilot episode of the series, there are other events that take place AFTER the final episode of the series. In other words, if you have NOT seen the TV series, do NOT watch this film. Watch the ENTIRE TV series first (from the pilot episode to the final episode. Even many events from the final episode have a direct effect on the movie) and THEN watch this movie.

If you decide to watch this movie without seeing the entire TV series first, then you will face two problems:

1) You are NOT going to know what the hell is going on (especially with the epilogue scenes). Even many of the prequel scenes will be confusing as hell if you haven't seen the TV series.

2) The movie will SPOIL (reveal) the majority of the plot twists from the entire TV series.

So once again, watch the ENTIRE TV series before watching this movie. Failure to follow this advice will result in you feeling VERY frustrated as you will have no clue what's happening or what certain events mean.

I'm giving this a four out of five stars since this serves as a perfect prequel AND finale to the Twin Peaks series. I can't really give it a perfect five stars since this film might not work for most people if they skip the TV series and watch the movie only. However, if you loved the Twin Peaks series, you will LOVE this film. If you haven't seen the Twin Peaks series, then STAY AWAY from this movie until you have.

680655,1,6303515304,"I'm sick of David Lynch.

I've seen many of his films, some of them that I liked, some that I hated -- ""Eraserhead"" in particular, although I found that movie too grotesque to watch -- and I have finally come to the conclusion that I just can't stand his films anymore.  He has a few hammers in his toolbox, and he brings those hammers out too often and seems to like pounding his audience into submission.

Take for example ""Blue Velvet.""  Dancers come out on top of the car while Dennis Hopper is giving his little soliloquy, and those dancers were cute the first time.  But Mr. Lynch does it over and over again in his films, for apparently no reason.  One comes out here, right at the beginning, and Keifer Sutherland is required, by Chris Isaak, to decipher every little meaning in the dance.  The dress, the mouth expression, etc. etc.  Give. . .me. . . a . . . break.  This is one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema.

And Mr. Lynch seems to like actors that speak in monotone.  Every film, every actor, monotone.  And it seems that he also likes to have actors that are either poor at their craft, or at least actors that act poorly in the moment.  I don't know about you, but when I watch a film, I'd rather watch quality acting.

I tried to watch this film again for the second time, and just couldn't stomach it.  The first time I watched, I ""endured"" this film (no one ""watches"" Mr. Lynch's films but rather ""endures"" them) because I used to live in the Seattle area, I never had seen ""Twin Peaks,"" and I wanted to see if the show was any good.  After watching the film that first time, I streamed the first season, and then just gave up on the second.  Same stuff, different day.  The whole thing was pointless.

I read somewhere that Mr. Lynch has almost given up on film and is now concentrating on music.  Good for him; keep it up.  At least I can change radio channels when his ""music"" starts to play.",1365552000,3,1925,4.306406685236769

680736,3,6303515304,"Just like every one of David Lynch's works, 'Twin Peaks-Fire Walk with Me' burrows into your brain and flashes upon it indelible, unconscious images that stay with you for days and weeks to come.  This 'Twin Peaks...' has some great moments.  It scares you; it envelopes you; and it keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time.

As the prequel and follow-up to 'Twin Peaks,' the TV series, there are flaws, missed opportunities, and (perhaps) some misconceptions that make this cinema adventure uneven and sometimes disappointing.  Even Mr. Lynch, himself, falters, for he as prime mover of this 'Twin Peaks...' (with the notable absence of co-creator, Mark Frost) competes with his other works, and maybe it is unfair to compare this work to so many masterpieces.

It has been stated that watching this movie without seeing the series would be confusing and lose a portion of the audience.  I don't entirely agree, but I can only imagine what it would be like to see this film fresh before the thirty segments on television.

We are of course interested in the life of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a troubled high school teen and homecoming Queen who has many secrets and living contradictions.  What made the TV series so stellar is the sense of mystery.  Laura's life and death were an enormous puzzle, one that kept unraveling and revealing itself through the astute observation, both grounded and paranormal, through the eyes, consciousness, and subconsciousness of F.B.I. agent, Gordan Cooper (Kyle McLaughlin).  Next to him was sidekick, Sheriff Harry Truman (Michael Ontkean) whose support, grounded the whole affair and gave it credence and plausibility.  On the fringe were sordid characters with various troubles and motivations, which both enhanced the suspect list, vitalized the story, and provided a night time soap, which was eventful enough to mock soap operas and give us one enough to find continually absorbing.

Once we have connected all the dots involving Laura Palmer, there are some missing holes but not many.  'Twin Peaks-Fire Walk with Me' works best when actual suspense works into play where the presence of danger are palpable and when the dots are truly connected to the series.  This happens primarily through the medium of a painting and with scenes from the wooden ""fire walk"" area, which match and elaborate those scenes that thrilled and chilled us best in the series.

'Twin Peaks-Fire Walk with Me' is the least effective at the beginning when the first murder takes place.  It isn't an element tacked on, for the fresh memories of a serial killer were known in the narrative of agent Cooper.  Yet, the way it starts doesn't help for the narrative or a set up for suspense.  Quickly, the movie finds its footing when we are transported to Philadelphia and F.B.I. headquarters.  The later scenes with Laura endear her to us more, but the intrigue and thrills are sometimes diluted when it simply acts out the revelations of her life.

In the end, the T.V. series was a connect-the-dots concoction that continued to intrigue, yet satisfy along the way.  Much of Laura's life was implied and left to the imagination.  In the movie, we can see the whole picture, but it often becomes paint-by-numbers after the initial portrait had been completed.  The inevitable conclusion is already known, the killer identified, and the exposition has been laid before us.

Maybe that is why the film was booed at the Cannes Film Festival.  Having an international audience, mostly consisting of French (People who often, but not always love ambiguity and enigma.  Consider 'Cache' after all, which left some lingering questions and some vague denouement elements.)  The French, after all, comprise some of Lynch's largest and most devoted fans.  'Twin Peaks--Fire Walk with Me' leaves little ambiguity, and only at times does it reconnect the awe and feelings of the supernatural world saturating the sordid lives, so permanently a part of our imaginations, making us intimate witnesses to such a colorful and darkly mysterious town.",1350086400,,4062,5.022388059701493

In the movie, she participates in it.  In the show, it's mentioned Bobby told Laura he killed someone.  In the film, she's right there with him while he kills someone.

680742,1,6303515304,"Loved the series and all the weird mysteries and characters it brought forth.

Fire Walk With Me was extremely frustrating because Lynch actually got a company to finance a Twin Peaks movie and then wasted this opportunity to create a proper send-off for the fans of the series. I would have much rather had a TP movie that moved forward from the events of the Season 2 finale which had all sorts of great possibilities. Even if the movie wouldn't have had Cooper (due to the actor not wanting to take part at first) the story could have easily focused on Sheriff Truman and others like Major Briggs or Gordon Cole or new FBI agent(s) being brought in to advance the plotlines.

I finished this movie feeling really frustrated and wishing it could have been more. I don't mind symbolism and don't expect all loose ends to be neatly tied up from the series, but I think if this is the final chapter in the Twin Peaks universe then it leaves me feeling pretty upset.

It is a typical Lynch movie, with some scenes or characters that you just wonder why? And as far as only those who loved the series can view this film, I would not agree.  The movie, as stated, is more of a prequel to the show, so not knowing anything about what happened afterwards, since makes this worth watching.  It is not hard to follow the story line...although sometimes Lynch's ""dream sequences"" and ""real sequences"" as with all his movies tend to get a bit blurred.
The acting is absolutely top notch, especially by the main leads of Laura and her Father.
As with all of Lynch's movies, he tends to draw you in and hold you there, until one scene (you decide) stays with you forever. For this movie it was the scene with ""Laura at the dinning room table and her dirty hands.""  I have others for other Lynch films.

680789,5,6303515304,"David Lynch was already well-known among film noir aficionados before 1990, but it was that year, when the pilot episode of the cult TV series Twin Peaks aired on ABC Network, that David Lynch would become a household name across the globe. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me represents an effort to answer the many questions that the convoluted--and often bizarre--stories from the TV series left. However, in what is typical for Lynch, the movie turns out even less palpable than the prime-time-friendly series. Fire Walk with Me narrates the last week in the life of the brutally murdered student Laura Palmer whose good-natured father turns abusive when under control of an evil spirit that has possessed him. Trying to escape the horrific abuse and her nightmares, Laura creates a double life: she starts prostituting herself in order to buy drugs so that she can escape her reality. As the title suggests, the town of Twin Peaks abounds in symbolism of dualism: every citizen of Twin Peaks has a hidden side; the city of Twin Peaks itself abounds in places that oppose each other, such as the Double R Diner, Norma's friendly country diner, and the seedy Haps Diner; or the White Lodge where good spirits live and the Black Lodge, where evil spirits live. What makes the film difficult to understand is Lynch's use of association and dream sequences as a vehicle to convey his abstract messages. Fans of his style love the movie for the red room scenes in the Black Lodge and an abundance of Lynch's trademark symbol: the red curtains. Although commercially a failure at the time of release, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me is a masterpiece of American filmmaking and needs to be seen to be appreciated.

680790,2,6303515304,"A week & a half ago, I decided to rent Twin Peaks for the first time & became instantly enthralled by the quirky characters, the foreboding atmoshere and, oh yeah, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer.  My reaction wasn't unlike most; I thought Season One was one of the most surreal tv experiences I've ever had and again, like most, I thought Season Two was good but could tell the wheels were starting to come off the cart.  Before watching Season Two however, I decided to read the reveiws on Netflix regarding Fire Walk With Me, wanting to know why it had such a low rating & whether or not I need watch it.  Of course, I learned the secret of who killed Laura before I wanted to but the answer didn't really surprise me for several reasons regarding his behavior during the show.

Needless to say, I finished Season Two & decided to give this a try regardless of what I'd read.  Unfortunately, I wish I could say I was pleasantly surprised.  FWWM didn't really shed light on anything the show hadn't already divulged.  I thought the weirdness that was sprinkled throughout the show was way too amped up here & got in the way of the storytelling.  That alone was FWWM's undoing.  Like other's have said, we really don't get to know Laura at all here other than a crying, sexed-up, drug addict which was a shame because Sheryl Lee had charisma enough for ten actress'.

And while some have said the violence & sex was pushed too far, I didn't think it went far enough.  I've seen more graphic sex scences on late night Cinemax.  I also didn't like was the handling of Laura's unstanding of Bob/Leland.  He had been screwing her for 3 or 4 years & she didn't know it was Leland until the day before he killed her?  Really?  I liked the idea the show gave us better, that Laura knew her father was molesting her but that there was another entity at work.

Bizarre. That's one word that comes to mind. Creepy is another. Seedy another. Its all of those words and more. Where evil and the real world meet in the worst kind of fate. No film then or since makes me feel like this almost perfect Lynch film.

I loved this film back in 1992 when it came out (saw it in a Federal Way, WA theatre back then with my ex-wife), and I loved it again today on HBO in my basement here in Horseheads, NY. I did not see a single episode of the TV series and, for me, this probably helped.

There's so much I could touch on, scene by lovely/horrid scene. But that would take days. Let me just say that every detail is done right. Freaky Feds? Truly inventive. Teenage angst? Looks at it perfectly. Rebellion from psychosis from incest. Creepy as it comes.

Let me ask a question for you. This is only for those of you who have sought after the good times, the high times that only booze, drugs and premature sex will bring. Have you ever found yourself in a situation, at night, high as a kite (or at least looking to get that way) and the situation turns ugly? Where the people around you (be they in a bar or some drug dealers house you don't know) start to make you feel really uncomfortable? Someone's worse off for their high and they start picking fights and talking *****, etc.? The fear and seediness in life that I felt in situations like that is where this film takes me. To my lowest and dirtiest.

Electric Bob lives in my nightmares, too, Laura! Oh, that didn't come out right, but you know what I mean. I'd of come up with that strange electric substitute myself if my Dad was doing me since I was 13. The way Lynch brings all of the craziness together after he confuses is nearly perfect. Poor Laura. I think she saw it coming. And then the Angel at the end. She thought she was going somewhere that angels don't live. She didn't see that one coming. Saved in the end. Perfect.

680794,5,6303515304,"This film should be viewed as an addendum to the entire Two Season epic television series TWIN PEAKS. (They've finally worked all the bugs out of the TWIN PEAKS - THE DEFINITIVE GOLD BOX EDITION, which is a worthwhile purchase for all Lynch fans.) When viewing David Lynch's brilliantly underrated prequel TWIN PEAKS FIRE WALK WITH ME, it is important to understand some key elements to Lynchean symbolism. David Lynch is an adherent of Eastern Vedic philosophy and meditation. Along with Eastern Vedic thought, Lynch also mixes shamanism and Christian mysticism into the much bigger cauldron of ""The Perennial Philosophy.""  (A term made popular in 1945 by Aldous Huxley's book by the same name.) The Perennial Philosophy is the recurrence of all universal religious or mystical truths inherently found in most cultures.

The Dreaming World: To mystics and shamans of countless cultures, the dreaming world is just as important as, if not more important than, the waking world. It is the place where the subconscious is free to associate with the superconscious mind, or the source of all consciousness. Like the dreaming world, the waking world is also a construct of perception. Pictures, images, and symbols. This is why it is hard to separate the dream world, or non-reality, from normal reality in most of Lynch's work. Dreams and normal reality are one and the same. The building blocks of the phenomenal world are illusive and illusory constructs. The pictures and images we witness as reality are essentially the same as the pictures and images we witness as dreams or non-reality. They are only constructs of consciousness. They are transitory states of perception that rise and fall out of emptiness.

Like many other Lynch films, FIRE WALK WITH ME depicts the dual nature of a waking and dreaming world. These two worlds do not separate in The Lynchean Universe.

Not all, but some of the actors from the TWIN PEAKS television series, and most of the critics, felt that Lynch had lost something with this film that was a part of the original television series: the dark underbelly of evil that was hidden just beneath the surface of a small idyllic town in Northern Washington. They felt that the film was too ""in your face."" (See the documentary on this disc.) While it is hard to witness, it was important for Lynch to pull no punches in depicting the events of Laura Palmer's tragic murder. Although it appears as such, the abuse and destruction of Laura Palmer is not a bogeyman lurking beneath her bed. It is the beast in man displayed in full form, breathing his foul stench into the face of the innocent. It is the curdled cream that floats to the top of a festering cup of evil coffee. A damn fine cup of evil coffee. It is not a story to be presented delicately or to be brushed under the rug to make it more palatable. It is a story of abuse that happens everyday. It depicts the harrowing, violation, and destruction of an innocent girl. Because of Sheryl Lee's brave and amazing performance, it is an extremely effective film. Psychologically and emotionally.

The film begins with the investigation into the murder of Laura Palmer's friend Teresa Banks, and takes place one year before the final days of Laura's life. The beginning of the film seems tacked on and unrelated to the events that take up the majority of the film one year later. But, this prologue is not superfluous. It is important to understand the symbolism of The Disappearing Agents. (See below.)

****************************SPOILERS*********************************

The symbol of The Doors: Doors are used by Lynch as symbols for entering into and out of subconscious memories, the hidden aspects of the psychological mind, the dreaming world, Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory.

The symbols of dream color: Dream colors are important to understanding Lynch. In dream sybolism, the color ""blue"" symbolizes truth, eternity, emotion, the feminine, and Heaven. Blue angels respresent guardian spirits or the super-ego. Blue light represents truth, enlightenment, Heaven, Nibbana (blowing out the FIRES of greed, hatred, and delusion), or Nirvana. I don't fully understand the meaning of the Blue Rose. Agent Cooper, referring to the murder of Teresa Banks says, ""This is one of Gordon's Blue Rose cases."" What does he mean? As blue can also represent sadness, it may signify the murder of a lonely girl, unclaimed by family or friends. The color ""red"" symbolizes power, anger, hatred, the id, primal and sexual urges, the masculine, and Hell.

The symbols of The Black Lodge and The Red Room: The Black Lodge represents the purgatory of samsara, ignorance, or the blinding ego of the self. The Red Room in the Black Lodge represents the lowest level of the self in The Black Lodge. The id, the primal self, animal urges, suffering, murder, or Hell.  (Briefly, because it is not mentioned in FWWM, The White Lodge represents escape from samsara, egoless enlightenment, Nirvana, or Heaven.)

The symbols of The Demons:  Bob is not presented as a symbol, but as a physical entity. Bob is an entity that feeds on fear, pain, and sorrow. ""Garmonbozia."" As a symbol, The Demon Bob represents the id, primal animal instinct, suffering, and/or pure evil. The Boy in the Mask (The Jumping Man) represents the fusion of the Leland/Bob personality. The monkey behind the mask represents Leland's primal self. Bob as his dark half. The incestuous and animal urges of Leland's id. The dwarf, or Man from Another Place represents the missing arm of The One Armed Man (Philip Gerard). The dwarf is The One Armed Man's connection to his base or animal self, The Red Room, and to Bob. He is still partly trapped in that world by his own karma. (At one time, The One Armed Man committed atrocities with Bob. Or, was possessed by Bob.) Other demons may represent other hidden aspects of the primal mind.

The symbol of Bob as psychological denial: Unfortunately, Laura is in many ways a victim of forces beyond her control (rape and incest). This makes her journey even more frightening and sad. The manifestation of Bob represents Laura's psychological denial of her incestuous rape by Leland.  The memory of Leland raping Laura since she was 12 years old, is replaced with the image of Bob as her attacker. Instead of fleeing from the years of abuse, Laura hides her true self inside her secret diary. As do most victims of abuse, Laura escapes psychological and physical torment into a world of self-abuse, drugs (cocaine), alcohol, and prostitution. (Sometimes victims of abuse will cut themsleves, which thankfully, Lynch does not portray here. )Years of abuse become psychological transference. Laura feels she doesn't deserve love on any level. She is empty and worthless. She becomes a self-loathing symbol of sexual lust, perversion, and desire to men. In the days proceeding her death, her choices are becoming limited, and her destiny is almost etched in stone. A force of karma that must be played out. In the most profound scene of the entire film, before heading into the hedonistic Pink Room, Laura receives a warning from The Log Lady about the path she has chosen to continue upon, which is only partly, of her own making. It is heartbreaking.

""When this kind of fire starts. it is very hard to put out. The tender bows of innocence burn first and the wind rises - then all goodness is in jeopardy.""
LOG LADY

Eventually, Leland/Bob finds Laura's diary, steals her true self, and shatters her identity completely. Only after many years of psychological trauma and denial, does Laura finally realize that Bob is actually her father Leland. Innocence is completely destroyed. Laura gives in to utter abandonment and fear, which leaves her defenseless against her total destruction.  That fear is completely devoured by Bob, who only exists to feed on fear.

The symbols of The Pictures: The original picture that hangs upon the wall of Laura's bedroom depicts children being served food by a guardian angel. This picture represents the love, warmth, comfort, and protection of home, which is disappearing for Laura. The other picture given to her by The Demons from The Black Lodge, which she later hangs upon her wall, depicts an empty room with an open door. This picture represents the Door to Hell. The disappearance of the guardian angel from the original picture on her bedroom wall symbolizes a point of no return for Laura. Laura's descent has taken her so far down the road to Hell that her guardian angel spirit (also symbolized by Agent Dale Cooper) can no longer save her from her fate, karma, or destiny. The second picture or symbol, supplants or usurps the original. Once Laura is pictured inside the door, there is no return. She will die.

The symbol of The Guardian Angel: A recurrent symbol for Lynch. By the end of the film, Ronette Polaski's guardian angel appears to her, as Laura is being murdered by Leland/Bob, and spares her from Laura's fate. (Ronette is later found alive in the TV series.) Only after Laura dies is she visited in the Red Room by her guardian angel and Agent Cooper. She then realizes that her pain and sorrow has reached an end. She will be released from puragtory, samsara, and suffering. A better world awaits her on the other side.

The symbols of The Green Ring and The Disappearing Agents: Agent Desmond (Chris Isaak) is transported to the Black Lodge after finding The Green Ring under the trailer and bending over to pick it up. Like the Door to Hell picture, The Green Ring symbolizes a path of no return. When Laura puts it on, she will die. Green symbolizes a ""going out,"" traveling, or leaving this world. The disappearance of Agent Jeffries (David Bowie) and Agent Desmond symbolize the good men who investigate these horrible crimes. They are transported into a psychological Hell, from which there is little or no escape. These are men that risk their own sanity and psychological well being in their battle with evil forces, and their search for justice. (In the series, while inside The Black Lodge, Agent Cooper agrees to trade his soul to Windom Earle for Annie Blackburn's. Annie's murdered image appears briefly in FWWM. Cooper himself becomes possessed by Bob at the end of the series. Too bad we never got to see where that journey would lead.) I choose to believe that the disappearing agents are Lynch's symbolic homage to them. They are the brave ones that walk around inside the psyches of these demons. Sometimes, they never return from the Hell of what they've seen. Hence, their disappearance in this film.

********************************************

There are animals rapists, demons, and monsters that walk among us. FIRE WALK WITH ME is an amazing metaphor for the destructive power they possess over their innocent victims. The victims can either be total strangers, or the immediate family members of these evil beings. The abused often become the abusers, and if not completely destroyed, often continue a neverending cycle of abuse and destruction. These themes are as just as profound today as when Lynch made this film. These monsters continue to walk among us.

The DVD includes a great documentary with the reflections of the cast and crew on the entire TWIN PEAKS phenomenon. It also includes some online features which I have not perused. As with most Lynch films, the DVD is not divided into chapters.

A very powerful film about a very dark subject. And, one of Lynch's best.

Enjoy.",1254441600,10,11460,4.922320041429312

At the end of August I decided to have an outdoor movie party, with my video projector and computer speakers. What movie should I show? Well everybody loves Twin Peaks, right? My wife invited a lot of her friends, who were much younger than me, and to my surprise, most of them were unfamiliar with the series.  They found the movie to be a real downer- which it is, a high school girl who was raped by her father and ultimately killed by him.  I realized that the only people who can really appreciate this film are ones familiar with the series. I also realized how old I am.  Watch Twin Peaks before watching this movie",1254355200,2,762,4.270833333333333
680839,4,6303515304,"Although TP: FWWM isn't Lynch's best work it still packs a hefty punch, and contains most of his trademark touches, both lucid and opaque. The exploration of Laura Palmer's self-indulgent descent into hedonistic hell can be a little tedious at times but is utterly mesmerising for the most part. Laura is about as self-destructive as a teenager can get, although it's clear from very early on that she's being prodded towards the precipice by a number of external influences. The Palmer family is a fragile and disturbed unit and tragedy is inevitable. There are some particularly memorable scenes, especially those inside the The Bang Bang Bar, which Laura frequents in order to satisfy her desperate urges.

Lynch and Engels have fashioned a fascinating and engrossing study of the last few days of an anguished life. If you're familiar with the wonderful TV series the outcome is known, but there is still plenty of tension and Laura's demise remains a brutal shock. As a companion piece to the ground-breaking TV series, or if you just enjoy Lynch's work in general, this is essential viewing.

It's also worth mentioning the score by Angelo Badalamenti, which is haunting throughout. And, of course, the marvellous Twin Peaks theme is used again here, and it's always a joy to hear that melancholy guitar!",1250294400,,1310,5.004587155963303
680840,5,6303515304,"That title is from the song (lyric by Lynch) that we actually get to see Julee Cruise perform midway through the film. 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' was booed at Cannes, perhaps because it diverges quite a bit from the TV series: it's less funny and more violent. Lynch appears liberated from the constraints of network TV. The sex, drugs and violence depicted go pretty far into 'R' territory. This is definitely for adults only. Some have suggested that the humor in the TV series may have been aimed at making it more palatable for TV. In any case, I found it gratifying that 'Fire' recognizes that the take-off point for the whole Twin Peaks phenomenon was the brutal murder of a homecoming queen who 'had it all'. Lynch is careful not to overplay that hand, but on the deepest level this is not a funny story. 'Fire' forces the viewer to confront that, which might account in part for the hostile reaction to it initially in some quarters. BTW, Sheryl Lynn was about 5 years too old to play Laura Palmer but her performance is so good that her age doesn't matter.

Don't expect everything to make sense (at least not on the first viewing) and be ready to roll with the weirdness.  The TV series was often very funny, but there aren't many laughs here.

I had no idea that Fire Walk With Me was a prequel when I popped it in - and judging by the way the series ended, I had no reason to believe it would be anything other than a tying up of loose ends.  So after passing the two hour mark, it dawned on me that we would probably never find out what happened after Coop left the Black Lodge at the end of Season Two - which was a bit disappointing.  That said, I really got into the movie and appreciated it as a character study of Laura Palmer.  It answered many questions discreetly as far as the mythology of the show and the story of the Black Lodge and its dwellers.

Here Lynch is totally unleashed, and yes, the story sometimes can turn confusing, but the images are mesmerizing and the music is excellent, I inmediatily loved the bar rock song and the track 'Moving through Time'. Nevertheless the slight confusion, you can follow the movie and the general story, it is just this kind of films that require full atention and even concentation on it, like Lost Highway, but the viewer is totally compensated with eye and ear candy, constantly with Lynch's imagination. Some may call it 'pretentious' but the director is a real artist, I wouldn't call it that, but maybe the approach is too fast and furious for some people and the anti-heroine's motivation and character is dubious, I fully understand some negative reviews.

I would never rank this as Lynch's best (that place belongs to Eraserhead, Elephant Man and Blue Velvet - and perhaps Wild at Heart) but is a worthwhile piece of work and left me hooked to continue with the TV series, surely it will be in my DVD collection.

680905,5,6303515304,"CONTAINS SPOILERS!

One of the most brilliant, saddest, most disturbing, and most beautiful movies ever made. This is the story of Laura Palmer and how her life spun out of control before her death. Sherryl Lee should have gotten an Oscar for her performance. She captures the erratic mood changes of the abused and drug-addicted Laura perfectly.

The first part of the movie describes the investigation of the murder of Teresa Banks. Part of the investigation involves a ring which, worn by the next victim, signifies the next person who is to die. There is a scene where one of the FBI agents (David Bowie) has somehow been captured or kept by the people from another place (the demons), and he (the agent) returns to the FBI headquarters. Then the movie cuts to Twin Peaks and the last few days of Laura Palmer's life. Essentially, this prequel explains the events directly relating to Laura Palmer's death in the Twin Peaks television series. She is being abused by her father, Leland/Mad Bob. In order to cope with her life, she has become addicted to cocaine. In order to pay for the cocaine, she becomes a prostitute and to secure the drug she feigns a love relationship with Bobby who is part of a chain of drug dealing in Twin Peaks. Gradually there is nowhere else for her to go, she needs more and more cocaine to feed her addiction. Her life spirals out of control and she is killed by Leland/Bob, who is jealous of her sexual relationships with other men.

I haven't read all the other reviews here, but I just had to add my opinion as I feel this is one of the deepest films I have seen. Make no mistake, this is a trip into both a dream and a nightmare. Unlike some of Lynch's offerings, this movie actually does more or less make sense (as did the Twin Peaks TV series). The problem occurs for some viewers because you have to think deeply to understand it and you have to understand metaphor and symbolism. The people from the other place are demons. You can regard them as real or you can regard them as metaphors - metaphors for what comes over a man when he has a compulsion to abuse his own daughter, metaphors for what comes over someone when she is addicted to hard drugs. The demons can also be seen as the drugs themselves. They feed off human pain (garbanzo beans). All of us has an animal behind the mask. The white mask has a sharp nose like an intravenous drug needle. We're ""civilized monkeys"". Interpreted in this way, suddenly everything makes even more sense.

I see nothing wrong with a look at what's under the surface of the quirky Twin Peaks, unhampered by the restrictions of writing for network TV.

The scenes in the black lodge are unforgettably dark and disturbing. Sheryl Lee's acting is unbelievable. The symbolism is stark and memorable.

After seeing ""fire walk with me"" I would gladly ask Lynch ""why?""
I saw the tv serie, I engulfed it with pleasure, despite it's sometimes goofy moments.  I know that you should never follow up any of Lynch's work under a convencional, sometimes even rational, posture.  Lynch is the mastermind of any filmed nightmare and he will never explain his mysteries.
This movie, however, seems to be made by two scholars trying to emulate David Lynch, by having a somehow interesting plot and then twisting it until it hurts and then adding and substracting characters and situations, twist again, shake, eat, throw up, and then put on the screen.
The metaphors and simbolisms are grotesque and utterly tacky, the acting is an insult and a risk to anybody's career and even the music is repetitive and tiresome.
To those who, like me, enjoyed the serie and wanted to know more, I suggest you use your money on something smarter, like burning it.  You will maybe get some satisfaction out of it, because the movie delivers none.

Sure, any fan of David Lynch will watch this movie whether they've seen the show or not, but it'll end up being confusing.  Even though it's a prequel to the series' events, it's made for those familiar with the plotlines from the show.  Characters will appear in one scene and will never be seen again, leaving those unfamiliar saying, ""who was that and what the hell did he have to do with anything?""  Not to mention Laura's killer not being a secret at all .  Even some fans were let down by this one coz many were expecting answers and probably ended up with more questions than anything.  Typical of Lynch though, eh?  The movie is definitely Lynch all the way.  It has the same slow, dreamy feeling of most of his films.  Of course it's full of oddball characters who's only purpose is to say goofy things and act weird.  But among all this strangeness, there is a story.  With an R rating, you get the feeling that this is how the series might have played out if Lynch wasn't bound by the restrictions of network television.  The first 40 minutes or so focus on the investigation of the girl murdered one year before Laura Palmer.  The investigators are played by Kiefer Sutherland and Chris isaak, who seem right at home in Lynch's FBI world next to characters like Agent Cooper, Albert Rosenfield and Gordon Cole.  Once that's done, we jump into Laura Palmer's last few days.  My problem with this is the fact that Laura comes across as extremely unlikable.  She's always screaming, snorting coke, screwing someone or freaking out somehow.  It makes it difficult to work up any sympathy for her considering you kept hearing in the series how loved she was by everyone in the town.  I do realize that it was said that in her last few days she began to act strange, and a reoccuring theme throughout the series was that she had a dark side.  I guess it does make sense that in her last few days the dark side would be at it's peak, but even with that said, she's still kinda irritating.  Also, the appearance of Agent Cooper(the star of the series, but more or less a cameo in the film) seems kinda forced, like he was required to appear coz it's a Twin Peaks movie.  His character had nothing to do with anything until Laura Palmer died, but in this film they try to work in some kind of psychic link/premonition thingee with him and Laura that doesn't seem to work so well.  Most fans won't care about this though coz they get to spend a little more time with their favorite FBI man.  Supposedly Lynch had to leave over an hour of this film on the cutting room floor.  In doing this, many characters from the show were completely deleted from the film.  Fans have been demanding these lost scenes for years now.  I don't know if these scenes would really clear anything up, but they'd certainly be fun to see.  Lets hope it happens.  All in all, an interesting movie if you've seen the show, and a confusing and seemingly pointless movie if you haven't.",1178496000,7,3083,4.457142857142857

When the series, Twin Peaks, came out was when I bought a vcr--so not to miss an expisode, even greived when it went off the air.  This movie takes up the last few day of Laura's life and us through a nightmare world of roaring and howling parallel universies that seem the only logical avenue to illustrate the horror Laura goes through.  I love what one reviewer said, that Lynch had to love this character to make the viewer so compassionate towards her. Striking soundtrack and cinematography that thrills with the bleakness of the trailer park and the saturation of the ""white lodge""?--where Laura ultimately goes.  The scene between Laura and Log Lady is magnificent:  When the fire starts, all innocence is in danger (my paraphrase of a much better scene)says LL to Laura.  And when the siren Julee Cruise sings ""Questions in a World of Blue,"" the angels indeed, as Laura says, cannot help her.(Note the scene when the angel disappears from the stylized picture of the 1940's.) Lynch's dialogue always wows: Donna:  ""Where are the cookies?"" Laura: You mean Fred and Ginger?"" Donna: ""Ah, dancing.""  Nobody, but nobody can write such dialogue.  I saw Blue Velvet first (maybe my all time fav. movie) and was hooked. Twin Peaks came next.  The girl running out of the school building looking like a 1950's scream queen--mainlining Lynch ever since.  Lynch is not for every taste, but he sure is for mine.",1170979200,5,1580,4.747252747252747

This film excels as psychologigal drama, holloween horror film, and expose of the disfunctional American family and the secrets therein. Lynch abandons the quirky humor used in the series to best effect. This film should be must see for every child abuser along with a jail sentence and I suppose that is one of the reasons some people cannot stomach viewing it. SPOILER>>To me Bob is Laura's denial/inability of her mind to comprehend her father's actions - Bob is LeLand.

I'll never forget the bar scene as the first glimpse of Laura's abandon/desperation is  shown then she becomes angry and protective of her friend unable to grasp her contradiction. The redemption scene at the end laughing/crying will touch your psyche and leave you speechless.

680946,5,6303515304,"Most people complain about Twin Peaks: FWWM not having most of the characters from the series, not having any humour, or not wrapping up the cliff hanger ending of the series.  By the time the series was towards the end of its run, it was different from David Lynch's original vision so its understandable why he'd want to go back to Laura Palmer.

This is definitely David Lynch's most dark and disturbing film.  Its about the last week of Laura Palmer's life, seeing her break down and death.  Sheryl Lee gives an amazing performance as the poor girl, with Ray Wise also giving an excellent performance as Leland Palmer.

The film still has that Lynchian weirdness, although its not as confusing as Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive.  Anyone who hasn't seen the series should not watch this until they do.  And it may take a few viewings to fully appreciate, but Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a true masterpiece, and in my opinion, David Lynch's best film along with Blue Velvet.",1167177600,4,983,4.6473988439306355

I really didn't understand Twin Peaks when it aired on ABC but I followed the series because of the colors, the cinematography and the female cast and their cool outfits and maquillage. I didn't even understand but was shocked and frightened by Maddy's last appearance. I just forgot about the show after that.

Fire Walk With Me is the prequel to the Twin Peaks series and shows Laura Palmer in the last week of her life.  It's unimaginable how sad and terrified she was. David Lynch is so smart and so good to be able to make the audience experience the perspective of someone in Laura Palmer's kind of trouble.  I actually think this movie should be shown to teachers so that they can learn something about what might be happening to kids.  This movie isn't as obviously stylish as the series.  It's definitely more emotional and more interesting.  You definitely do not need to see Twin Peaks to see this movie.  I think this movie would have been better appreciated had there never been a Twin Peaks tv series but then Cooper's weirdness would have been startling and a distraction.

680948,5,6303515304,"This film caught a lot of flack for being very 'un-Twin Peaks' like in its sensibilities. In Twin Peaks tv show by necessity everything had to be innuendo and hints to appease tv censors. I personally don't know why everyone was so shocked by Lynch's approach regarding child sexual abuse/incest in this film. When given free reign to express himself in film he has never censored himself to protect delicate sensibilities. He certainly didn't do it in Blue Velvet, and he didn't do it in this film.

 Child sexual abuse/incest is one of our societies true horrors and to try and lessen its impact to protect the audience from the truth of it would be an insult to those who have suffered from it. Also how would the voyeur understand sexual abuse and its domino effect on someones life if Lynch watered it down?

 Lynch in this film doesnt pander to the victims of abuse either. The main character has literally dozens of opportunities to ride off into the sunset for what one has to assume is a better life.

 The fact that the main character chooses to denegrate herself after being denegrated by others gives an insight into the psyche of abuse. In showing this the film seems to transcend its story of sexual abuse and gives a good picture of how the abused often degenerate themselves and turn towards evil. In doing this he gives an insight into evil itself, yet he never excuses evil and shows the consequences of it.

 The film offers hope for redemption however, and despite choosing to 'Walk with Fire' the main sufferer is redeemed at the end of the story. This is not a sterotypical Hollywood ending, this is kind of a cosmic justice. Someone who has suffered so much through their life is offered in death peace.

 A necessary, and revealing work of art. In my opinion one of Lynch's most unyielding and important works.",1165190400,9,1834,4.632716049382716
680999,5,6303515304,"The cult show ""Twin Peaks"" was reknowned for being weird and oddballish, but until fans have seen ""Twin Peaks - Fire Walk With Me,"" they ain't seen weird yet. Without the restraints of weekly TV, David Lynch allows his unnerving imagination to run wild as it explores what happened before Laura died.

It begins with another FBI investigation -- waitress Teresa Banks has been murdered, but not much of the investigation is going forward. Then the investigation is dropped, and the movie  skips ahead a year, showing us the last week of Laura Palmer's (Sheryll Lee) life.

In the course of those days, Laura is slowly slipping over to the Dark Side -- drugs, prostitutional sex, and nightmarish visions that are increasingly consuming her life. But as the drugs and sex take over Laura's life, she doesn't realize that a worse fate awaits her -- death, ""wrapped in plastic.""

David Lynch is known for making movies that are absolutely addling. They can make your brain hurt, and sometimes you never understand them at all. ""Fire Walk With Me"" goes under this heading. At the same time, it makes you think. And think. Like an Expressionist painting, it captivates as it bends your mind.

Lynch doesn't follow a real plot; instead, he lets the storyline slowly sink into Laura's downfall. Lynch paints the whole experience with nightmarish, surreal images and visions, and allows it to drip into your subconscious. And along the way, he fills it with slightly offbeat direction, heavy atmosphere, and the ability to make anything -- ANYTHING -- look menacing.

It's not exactly friendly to Lynch virgins -- if you don't know what to expect, this will simply tie your head in knots. And though this is a prequel, watch the TV show before venturing in here -- otherwise the appearances by Twin Peaks residents will simply go over your head. (Although it's fun to play ""Spot David Bowie"").

Lee does an excellent job as Laura, careening through the movie with a sense of doom. Laura's not likable here, but Lee keeps her from being a two-dimensional ""fallen woman."" And Moira Kelly is amazing as her good-girl pal Donna, while Kiefer Sutherland and Harry Dean Stanton have brief but solid roles as the FBI agents.

Though reviled when it was released, ""Fire Walk With Me"" This prequel was the last hurrah of the ""Twin Peaks"" series, but at least it was a worthwhile one.",1161993600,11,2365,4.807881773399015
681000,4,6303515304,"If the words above could be used to describe another Lynch movie - the much applauded ""Lost Highway"" (1997) whose plot is inspired in part by Kafka's ""Die Verwandlung"" and the well-known O.J. Simpson-case - they are as much descriptive of his earlier and less critically acclaimed film ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" (1992).

After two fascinating intermezzos (namely ""Industrial Symphony No. 1"" [1990] and ""Wild at Heart"" [1991]) David Lynch returns to the ever more surreal and absurd mystery of ""Twin Peaks"" (1990-1991) together with writer Robert Engels. While the Tv-series opened to rave reviews and much acclaim, audience interest dwindled and critics grew tired during the much debated second season. Leaving no finite answers as to mystery of Laura Palmer's murder-case, the series went as far as to finish with a question, in fact a strangely diabolical one: ""How's Annie...?""

There are perhaps no definite answers either in the prequel ""Fire Walk With Me"", however the subjective story of Laura's Persephony-like descent into Hades remains as tantalizing and surreal as ever. To be true, the story of Laura's dire straits resembles much that Fred Madison in aforementioned ""Lost Highway"". And there will never be an ending quite as persuasive, though explicitely violent and misogonitic, as when Laura in the red room is underscored by the classical masterpiece ""Requiem in C Minor"".

Two scenes in particular deserve mentioning as two of Lynch's most explicitely and vividly subjective (some would argue 'surreal' or perhaps 'impressionistic') sequences ever:

(1) an almost (and obviously intentionally so) unintelligible scene in a filthy bar near the American-Canadian border where Jacques Renault apparently (though never audible to 'us') gives hints as to the murder of Teresa Banks.

and,

(2)an excessively loud, noisy scene where Laura and Leland, both seated in Leland's car, are held back in traffic by a timber truck and an old handicapped couple. The eerie tone slowly turns deafening before erupting in a violent (almost abusive) musique concrte - mirroring the abuse of Laura and the (beautiful?) absurdity of life in an almost Epsteinian fashion.

The film has so often ""fallen victim"" to misreadings and critical devaluation, but in its uncanny and eerily surreal stimmung it should, instead, be recognised as the very essence of Lynchian. Demanding as it may seem, ""Fire Walk With Me"" is meant to be experienced and felt, as much as it is meant to be intellectually understood.",1152576000,6,2508,5.239401496259352

Sheryl Lee and Ray Wise are nothing short of phenomenal as Laura and Leland Palmer. Knowing full well what their fates will be during the film and the TV show, it gives the film a power that resonantes even though the we as the viewers know the outcome.

That David Lynch shows that there was some hope for both of them, however brief, makes it very poignant.

I hope New Line can re-issue this title as a Platinum Series or Infinifilms edition. Fans deserve to see the deleted scenes and an audio commentary by Lee and Wise, since Lynch doesn't do them.",1150675200,3,758,4.323943661971831

Art is just like that. You like it or not. If we are to be so snob to just say ""Yes! What a wonderful piece of Art. That is Pollock's masterpiece. This goes beyond anything done before"", well ... just fine. You are just being snob. But the good thing about art is that we can disagree, and that it is subjective, never objective. I just watched this movie today and I did not like it. Period. I never watched the TV Show (and I never will), and I do not care about Lynch being a talented and special gifted film director.

Without the restraints of television David Lynch lets his imagination cut loose (a televsion is literally smashed to pieces at the end of the opening credits)and you may not understand everything but it's more straightforward than later Lynch mindtrips. The first half hour(which if you've seen this on T.V. is sometimes entirely lopped off)which features the investigation of Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland is slow and strange. It concludes with a freakish David Bowie cameo before journeying to Twin Peaks and Laura Palmer herself where the film really takes off. Trying to escape the mysterious being Bob who molests her she descends into a vortex of drugs and sex. In the performance of her life Sheryl Lee gives an intense emotionally unstrung performance as Laura making her descent all the more harrowing. There are some scenes that have such a dreamlike quality they are unmatched in modern cinema:Laura's best friend follows her to a club where Julee Cruise sings the heartbreaking ""Questions In A World of Blue"" before abruptly swiching to a nightmarish strobelit club complete with clanging music. Laura's journey into a picture on her wall into the otherworldly lodge. Laura losing her grip on reality stumbling through a pitch black wood. The climax is gutwrenching and hard to watch(and reportedly slightly toned down after the audience at the Cannes film festival were too sickened to enjoy their dinner afterwards)and will leave you shaken. As always Lynch gives us no deleted scenes or commentary leaving us to deal with the film as it is. Oviously not for all tastes and there's no quirky humor for fans of the series.

Although you will better understand what's going on if you have seen the show, none of this will really seem new or interesting to you.  You learn some new facts about Bob and The Man from Another Place, but nothing of any real importance.  For the most part it just tells the story as we have already pieced together from the show, adding only pointless and unfortunate new occurrences (SPOILERS: Bobby kills someone, Donna is replaced by a new actor, Coop foresees all the future comings of Laura's murder, et al END SPOILERS).  All of the ""Twin Peaks"" charm from the series that you have come to love is gone, and the movie really suffers from that.  You can't give Coop only ten lines and expect the movie to be a success.

I think Lynch's efforts would have been more successful and greatly appreciated if he had made a sequel to the second series, focusing on the complications of Coop being in the Black Lodge, Harry having an emotional attachment to Coop but being forced to bring him down, etc.

I guess, if you haven't seen the series before the film may be more interesting, though I would be reluctant to recommend it to people either way.  Overall, the look and feel of the movie was very foreign and uncomfortable and it moved very slow.  Furthermore, it was a let-down coming from a monster writer/director like David Lynch.

Fire Walk With Me switches gears several times, from a decective flick, to comedy, to drama and horror, from dream to reality. Oddball goofy to dead serious in seconds. However, it maintains a ""feeling"" throughout, an ominous foreshadowing of events to come. David Lynch is a big fan of symbolism, and I can think of at least 10 different objects in this movie that stand for something other then what they are. Some of them are obvious, and some I don't think even Lynch have fully connected to the story.

681032,2,6303515304,"I've watched nearly every David Lynch movie ever made, and I hate to say that this one disappoints me.  This is a film that terrified and intriguied me, and once it had its grip it wouldn't let go.  But I patiently watched the entire movie because I was sure there was a payoff and something better waiting to shows its true face.  Well, the last few minutes are unforgettable, but 2 hours is a very long wait.

I haven't watched the TV series, but know some of the basics through interviews with Lynch, and some clip segments.  I know this doesn't qualify me to fully appreciate what's here, but I felt comfortable with the material.  Understanding what's here isn't the issue.  It's whether the payoff is worth it that really counts.

Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) is basically an unlikeable, promiscuous, and troubled teen.  After a wonderful first half-hour, which began with a brilliant shot of an axe smashing a television set and ended with some great detective scenes, we are finally introduced into Laura's world.  We learn later how the previous murders are linked, but that's explained with a brief flashback that is more jarring than fulfilling.  We finally see who brutally murdered Laura Palmer, but she's gone through so many bizarre and disturbing scenarios that the murder came damn close to losing effect.  We meet all sorts of odd characters, but don't get to really know them because Lynch is so fascinated with what he can do, instead of what his camerawork and storytelling do for us, the audience.  I admire directors who make their movies the way they want (Lynch, George Lucas, Stanley Kubrick), but a viewer's opinion still counts for something.

I believe David Lynch when he says that he doesn't always know why the images he envisions end up on the screen, not to mention what they really mean.  Does that mean it's open to our interpretation?  I could accept that because the masterpiece ""Mulholland Drive"" didn't explain much through dialogue or concrete answers.  But ""Mulholland Drive"" had a sense of control, and that it was all leading up to something worth waiting for, plus characters who we could care about.  ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" is a painful movie to watch in two senses.  First, it's painful because it's filled with cruelty and emotional damage, without any shed of happiness until the closing shot (or is that really happiness?...Angelo Badalamenti's contrasting score plays both sides of the argument).  The second reason this prequel is painful is simply because I kept seeing so many set pieces with no cohesion, parallels without satisfaction, and miserable human beings without any reason to sympathize or analyze.

I will give this movie credit because, as always, Lynch knows how to stir our imaginations with his unique visual style.  But he also knows how to raise our expectations without delivery, and like ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wild At Heart"" (which I believe are okay movies) this one wasn't worth the wait.  However, I will also give Lynch credit because I've just been convinced to purchase the first season of ""Twin Peaks"" on DVD.  I won't forget ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"", but I also don't think I'll grow to like it very much.",1125187200,12,3197,4.845303867403315

However, to those of us who loved TP, all I can say is, ""Wow!""  In a way, this was Lynch's own STAR WARS first trilogy, in which he finally got to tell his backstory of Laura Palmer and the events that lead to her death, without the restraints of TV censorship.

This is a very dark and haunting film, at times, scarier than any good horror movie.  It never fails to hit the mark with Lynch's bizarre style of directing.  The score is nothing short of menacing, and it has to be to tell this story properly.

There is a psychological edge here when watching it, because you already know our heroine is going to die at the end.  The build-up of each passing day and the horrors that surround Laura Palmer suck you in, and at times, turns your stomach.

This film, his cerebral and dreamlike prequel to the TV series, is one of his most intense works.  Being set free of TV allowed him to finally say goodbye to his greatest work in the most freeform and hard hitting fashion.  If David Lynch had had total control over the TV series, it would've been a LOT more like this movie.  Just pay attention to the episodes of the TV series which begin with ""Director : David Lynch"" and you will see exactly what I mean (they are always very similar to this movie in particular the very last episode in which Cooper has his direct encounter with the Black Lodge).

""We got a phone here, it's got a little ring""

The film takes place in two sequences.  First, we follow the FBI back to Bob's original kill, a certain Teresa Banks.  We learn her story, the fact that the Black Lodge has been investigated by the FBI for a long time now (the Blue Rose symbol means the case is strange, having to do with the Lodge) and we encounter the local Cops and get to hear their feelings on the FBI (""So What"").  The first part of the film is like a hazy dream sequence - a heady calm before the storm that follows.  There is also a foreshadowing of Cooper's encounter with the ""Doppelganger"" in the final episode...

""There's dirt... way under this fingernail""

The second part of the film is not for the faint of heart.  When we cut to Twin Peaks itself, you can almost feel the presence of the evil spirits hungering for Laura's soul.  This second part of the film is something you really, really wouldn't want a small child to watch.  It's intense and shows the dark, wicked descent into what Laura's final days were like.  She directly makes contact with the evil spirits before her death and it seems like she has known of their presence in Twin Peaks for a while.  Indeed, it seems like the Black Lodge seeks to destroy her because of how good she is at times.  Laura seems kind of like the ""keystone"" for the whole town - in taking down Laura, the evil could take the whole town.  Their efforts are frustrated by the arrival of knight in shining armor FBI agent Dale Cooper though.

Eventually we see how it all concludes (in perfect sync with the TV series too... everything falls into place) in the train car late that night and Bob emerges to claim his victory.  However, we see that Bob can't always get exactly what he wants.. and we see the arrival of the angel known as ""Judy.""  This is possibly Laura's guardian angel or simply a rogue angel who watches over the Twin Peaks area... regardless, the final moment of the film involves this angel, Cooper (comforting Laura) and her possible ascent into heaven through Judy (disproving the earlier theory).",1121472000,,2967,4.4804469273743015

The other dimension aspect of Bob and the creepy little man ""Arm"" is a little crazy and although it might go some of the way to explain why Laura's life is so messed up and how she ended up dead - it raised many questions as well.

I think.",1121040000,,456,4.089887640449438
681037,4,6303515304,"At the time of its initial release, Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me (a feature length prequel to the much lauded Twin Peaks TV show) was panned by critics and mainstream audiences alike. No doubt, some of the negative reaction was due to the fact that many were not intimately familiar with Lynch's work beyond the Twin Peaks phenomenon. Twin Peaks was certainly continuous, stylistically and thematically, with his previous body of work but even if the show did manage to push the boundaries of what was acceptable in mainstream media, it was still a subdued experience. Initially intrigued by the possibility of creating an 'open-ended' TV show, with an evolving story line, Lynch became increasingly frustrated with the limitations of the medium (in fact, within the very first frame of Fire Walk with Me, he takes the opportunity to show a TV set being smashed).

Fire Walk with Me is a full-out Lynchian experience: this means that Lynch does not have to worry so much about plot. He can infuse the screen with all his darkly mysterious and oneiric imagery (imagery in Lynch's world is as much visual as it is aural) and concentrate on building a 'mood'. Fire Walk with Me is devoid of the comic relief that served to defuse some of the tension in the TV show. The movie traces homecoming queen, Laura Palmer's agonizing last days (before she is found wrapped in plastic, in a beautifully haunting scene that served as the launching point for the first two seasons of the TV show), building a moving portrait of her downward spiral. Most of the focus is on Laura (played by Sheryl Lee) and the other town characters take only a background role. Sheryl Lee's performance in the movie was recognized even by film's detractors: her portrayal of a disturbed young woman, whose inner and outer worlds are literally coming apart at the seams, is convincing and poignant.

While someone unfamiliar with the TV show could watch and even enjoy the movie, it is highly recommended that one be familiar with Twin Peaks before watching Fire Walk with Me. Some of the TV show's regulars however are missing in the movie - most notably Moira Kelly replaces Lara Flynn Boyle in the role of Donna Hayward. The movie also introduces a few new characters. The DVD extras are quite disappointing: all that is included is a theatrical trailer and a skewered documentary composed it seems from unused interview footage.",1116979200,,2402,4.799516908212561
681038,1,6303515304,"If you liked this movie you are a pretentious tool and probably think you're the 'movie guy' at your school or job.

Daid Lynch [...] with a passion, this whole movie is a head ache. And if you think it's genius to have a guy talk on a phone while taking a crap and watching a Hawaiian chick dance for him naked (wild at heart) you know nothing about movies and probably annoy everyone who knows you. Now don't get me wrong I like obscure, oddball movies as much as the next movie-school drop out, but there's a line between weird and stupid and Lynch crosses this line in almost all his movies. If I made a movie where there's a 5 minute scene of a guy feeding apple sauce to a chimp in a deserted circus, that doesn't make me an edgey genius that makes no compromises that makes me an idiot.

  There's a scene where David Bowie storms into an office and starts yelling like a mad man for no reason and the scene ends with no more Bowie in the rest of flick. And there's a scene where Laura Palmer's father snaps at her for not washing her hands for dinner even though he told her to sit down at the dinner table right when she came in, and starts strangling her and yelling about her finger nails being dirty while the mother cries dramatically. These are just two examples of many long, boring scenes that go no where. That last scene i mentioned would be almost laughable if Lynch didn't take himself so seriously. I mean it could a premise for an old 'Kids in the Hall' skit. I didn't care when Laura Palmer got killed like she annoyed me with everybody else in the movie; except Harold Dean Stanton, he's always pretty cool.
Anyhow, This director tries way to hard to be weird and I for one can see right through him. The only good movies he made was 'Elephant Man' and 'Blue Velvet' so all you Lynch loving Eraserheads should get a hint and start following better filmmakers.",1108166400,11,1883,4.3107344632768365
681063,5,6303515304,"I remember ""Twin Peaks"" from when I was a kid, meaning that I remember the hype surrounding the series when it came out, and the way its increasingly gratuitous weirdness eventually alienated all but the hardest-core fans.  I remember those commercials in which you'd see the face of ""BOB"" morph into that of an owl, etc.  It all looked really strange and occult and obscure.  I was too young to get into it, but the fascination of the show kind of stuck with me through the years.  Later I became a fan of Lynch's films, particularly the brilliant ""Mulholland Dr.,"" and from time to time I'd think oh yeah, this was the ""TP"" guy, but the general unavailability of the series as a whole kept me away from it. (Which is why it's just plain stupid to stall the release of the second season of a show like this - especially when there are only two seasons total!  But I digress.)  Eventually I wound up borrowing the pilot and first season DVD from a friend.  Guess what, I got addicted, so I had to ""acquire"" the second season online.  I even read the (likewise generally unobtainable) ""Secret Diary of Laura Palmer,"" a truly gripping and powerful piece of writing by (if I recall) David Lynch's daughter, which recounts in first person the gory details of Laura's years of abuse and torture at the hands of the mysterious entity known as BOB.  Take out the supernatural elements in this book and you're left with a convincing case study of the psychological impact of incest, drug abuse, and secrecy.

After all this I felt prepared to see the film.  It's probably ideally best to watch ""Fire Walk With Me"" last, as a capper.  If you've watched the whole series you already know who killed Laura, and whether you have or not, ""FWWM"" will probably raise more questions than it answers - that's why we love it - but so much of it depends on the viewer's acquaintance with the show that it still makes sense to see the film last.

As with the show, the movie bears interpretation on many levels at once, and Lynch is always teasing you with suggestions of diverse ""working theories.""  On the one hand, it often feels like a perfectly straightforward after-school special on the topics of sex, drugs and incest.  There are hints that all the ""supernatural"" aspects are simply elaborate imaginary ways for Laura (and maybe her father) to deal with the unspeakable.  Maybe there really is no BOB, as indeed shut-in Harold Smith remarks early on in the film - maybe he's just a cypher for Laura's father, rather than a demonic entity that possesses him to molest her.

And yet there's an equal insistence on the supernatural, with repeated references to the mysteries brought up in the series, as well as some new symbolism unique to the movie, e.g. the ""blue rose.""  There are sections in which ""FWWM"" dissolves into abstract stream-of-consciousness-style hallucinations in the midst of what almost looked like it was going to be an ordinary narrative, most notably the bizzare segment at the Philadelphia headquarters in which Cooper splits in two, missing agent Philip Jeffries suddenly turns up out of nowhere and the next thing we know we're above the notorious ""convenience store"" with BOB, the Little Man From Another Place, the ""Chalfonts"" and others, all spewing typical symbolic rhetoric about formica tables and ""Garmonbozia.""  It's extremely suggestive, but I doubt anybody really knows EXACTLY what it's about, Lynch included, although the references will stick in your head and tease you as you try to puzzle through them.

This is the secret of the undeniable fascination of the whole ""TP"" phenomenon, and much of Lynch's work.  I've watched the hell out of ""Mulholland Dr.,"" and every time my theory changes, and I actually doubt that there's any one all-purpose solution to the cluster of mysteries.  There are various explanations for various events, sometimes mutually exclusive, but all seeming to relate to the same nexus of intrigue in some indeterminate sense.  But Lynch never gives the secret away completely.  He claims in interviews that he doesn't always know what his own symbols mean at the time, and that he's as shocked as anybody when he ""figures them out.""  And actually, I believe him!

A common remark in these reviews, whether the reviewers have seen the series or not, regardless of how they interpret the story, is that this film stays with them and haunts them for hours afterwards.  It has an undeniable archetypal power.  It's definitely much darker than the series, which overemphasized the light comedy elements to appease tame network viewers, but after all, this IS the story of the brutal rape and murder of a teenage girl, and the film depicts this quite vividly.",1107820800,96,4703,4.808695652173913
681064,4,6303515304,"...as a Lynch fan, a big pet peeve of mine is when people wish for a ""director's cut"" of this film, as in the review below. Lynch has had final cut on ALL his films except Dune, and so they all (except Dune) can be properly called director's cuts. FWWM as it stands is the version Lynch supervised and approves of. It's true that a lot of scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, but that's how movies are made. A rough cut is first assembled using everything, and the director and editor whittle it down from there. That said, Lynch has expressed interest in including the cut scenes in a FWWM DVD, but only as separate extras. He won't cut them into the film because he likes it as it is.",1107475200,3,692,4.2105263157894735
681065,4,6303515304,"I had heard much about the cult television series ""Twin Peaks"", and decided to buy the First Season on DVD.  When I found that none of the stores near me had it in stock, I decided to pick up the movie instead.  In some ways, this was good.  In some, it was bad.  Let me explain ...

In 1991, ""Twin Peaks"" was canceled.  Immediately popular director David Lynch, who also created and wrote most of the show, said that he wasn't finished with the show yet ... and set to work making a movie that would close off the ""Twin Peaks"" phenomenon.  ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" - this film - is the result, a 135 minute journey into a realm where insanity and madness reign supreme.

""Fire Walk With Me"" is a prequel to ""Twin Peaks"".  The first thirty minutes deal with two FBI agents, Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland), who are investigating the murder of a young girl in the small town of Twin Peaks.  Just when Desmond seems to have a suspect, we fade out and find that we are months later.  From there, the film follows the events leading up to the mysterious death of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), which the series focused on.  Kyle MacLachlan has some screentime as the series' main character, Dale Cooper.

This is probably the hardest film to review in the world.  First of all, let me say that if you aren't a fan of ""Twin Peaks"" or of David Lynch, you will be lost shortly after the film begins.  This movie was created solely for ""Twin Peaks"" lovers, and if you haven't seen the show, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer is unveiled in this movie.

If ever there has been a movie that is pure insanity, it is this.  ""Fire Walk With Me"" is one-hundred percent madness.  And yet, throughout the whole film, I was completely mesmerized.  And when the movie ended, I couldn't speak or do anything for about an hour.  This movie truly has an effect on you, whether you're a fan of the show or not.

The cast is terrific, but it's David Lynch and Angelo Baladamenti who steal the show.  Lynch is either a madman or a genius - I can't decide between the two.  But Baladamenti is certainly a master composer, because his score for this film is beautiful.

Seeing is believing.  That fits perfectly from this film.  Perhaps after I watch the show, I will better understand this film.  Until then, I can just say that it the most undescribable, frightening, mesmerizing, and astonishing film I've ever seen.",1104969600,4,2435,4.462585034013605
681066,3,6303515304,"I don't like it... but who the hell am I?

David Lynch put fans of the TV show on notice when he opened Fire Walk With Me with a shot of TV set being smashed with an axe.  As a fanatical Twin Peaks devotee, I remember remarking to a friend that ""it should have been called 'Fire Suck With Me'"".

In retrospect, that may have been a little harsh.  What made Twin Peaks so absorbing for me was, in large measure, what makes any soap opera so addictive to its fans... story!  Twin Peaks took a big complicated story and let it unfold in a stylish and leisurely way.  You got to savor the mystery.  I loved the way that the element of the supernatural wasn't even introduced until the third episode, and that was in the most low-key way imaginable, with Agent Cooper explaining his dream about Tibet.

Where I am coming from is: I consider myself a fan of Lynch's more traditional narrative work.  Loved ""Blue Velvet"".  Loved ""Wild At Heart"".  Hated ""Eraserhead"".

In retrospect, I admire Lynch for making a film that was not a repackaging of old concepts, that would split the Peakies right down the middle. But I don't like it.

Not everything that I don't like about FWWM is Lynch's fault. After all, it wasn't Lynch's fault that, by the time the film was made, many of the cast looked kind of silly as high school students, their undeniable status as adults all the more obvious on the big screen.

On it's own, ""Fire Walk With Me"" is pretty interesting, but for a certain kind of fan, it's more of a footnote than a continuation of the classic TV series.

Here's a tip: I got my DVD copy in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50.  You may want to check your local WalMart before spending more.",1104105600,3,1694,4.364217252396166
681067,5,6303515304,"I was a Twin Peaks fan, too, but this movie I love.

 It may have been an accident: I sometimes wonder how attached to the thing Lynch was, the concept not being his alone but something he shared with Mark Frost. But forced to apply his specific way of seeing things to a pre-existing framework, he created a prequel to the series that was everything the series could not be, and in the process gave us some kind of masterpiece. Maybe it isn't as purely Lynch as Eraserhead or Blue Velvet, and perhaps it isn't as comfortable as Twin Peaks, but it is BETTER than any of them, perhaps because Lynch was forced to find an uneasy balance between that snakepit in his head and the demands of commercial cinema. Straining against the bonds of expectation (and breaking most of them) was good for him, and whether he felt any intimate attachment to the project or not, it seems to me to be the most successful presentation of his inner world.

 Fire Walk With Me managed to chill me to the bone more than once in its running time, and I thought I was beyond being frightened by film forever. It also makes me cry every time I see it. The film is also literally thrilling, presenting a frightening and malign universe in which the damaged, angelic (and doomed) agents of a surreal FBI simply prove too delicate to survive with souls intact in the face of the kind of evil that would drive a father to rape his own daughter. You hear the word 'nightmarish' bandied about a lot in regard to horror films, and while I don't think I've ever heard this nightmarish thing referred to as a horror movie, that is just what it is: absolutely the finest horror film ever made. In the world of Fire Walk With Me it is the spiritual natures of the characters themselves that are in jeaopardy, and it is the stakes being so high that lends the story its depth and great power. This is going to sound like a ridiculous claim, but the closest approximation I know in literature is Dostoevsky. Remember the hair raising scene in Brother's Karamazov when the crippled girl who loves Alyosha purposely slams her finger in the door, and the look on her face? Or the scene in the Possessed in which the nihilist has agreed to commit suicide in order to prove that he is free, but is found in his pitch black room apparently trying to disappear into the wall? If those images stay with you, you're wired right to find a new favourite in Fire Walk With Me.

 Twin Peaks was good in many ways, but it was also flabby -- most of the supporting characters could profitably have been dispensed with, particularly in the second season (and in Fire Walk With Me they are) -- and if we don't get as much of Dale Cooper as we might have liked in Fire, we should be glad that we at least get Lynch's final, purest meditation on what the series was all about. Strange as it may seem, this bizarre film about the darkest things is also one of the most paradoxically life affirming things I know of. Not only does it make me feel better about the movies and their potential, it makes me feel better about people.",1103500800,9,3071,4.397887323943662
681068,5,6303515304,"Let me start off by saying that I never watched the series because I was very young at the time. But I saw the movie a couple of years ago and I saw it again recently and it's now on my top ten list. To the people who say that you have to have watched the series to grasp the movie and to get into it, I tend to disagree. Although I did not understand everthing that went on, that is what I think kept me interested in it in the first place and makes me want to see it again and again. I saw ""Mulholland Drive"" as well a while back and I also thought it was a good movie though I prefer ""Twin Peaks."" Sheryl Lee is amazing and intense. I fell in love with her character and her tortured soul. I'd love to find out what other films she's done that other people would recommend seeing. With this movie, I walked away feeling that it's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen and also the most cruel and anguished. When a director can make audiences feel such a wide range of emotions after seeing his films, that is a sign of a great director to me. As you can see by now, I would highly recommend everyone see this film as long as they have an open mind and don't expect to be spoon fed all the meanings and details of a movie.",1102032000,4,1233,3.975806451612903
681069,4,6303515304,"Twin Peaks - Fire Walk With Me looks great on this DVD.  The image is very crisp and clean, and the movie sounds great too.  Like all of David Lynch's films, you should turn the volume way up to catch the little sound hints within the movie (listen for the 'angel theme' whenever you see the angels in the painting in the film... it's quiet and subtle, but a detail that's cool) and because his movies all sound so interesting and awesome.  He really puts a lot of detail into the sound of all of his movies.

The movie itself is something of an acquired taste, especially if you're well acquainted with the series.  Don't expect a Twin Peaks episode.  I've warmed up to the movie and many Lynch fans, including myself, tend to rate this as one of his best.  Warming up to the movie takes a couple of watchings.  But this movie is very rewatchable, never boring.  Great performances by Sheryl Lee and Ray Wise, some more great music from Angelo 'Bad Angel' Badalamenti, and a finale that always makes your heart pound faster and faster until the climax.

However, while the movie itself is transferred quite nicely onto this DVD, the bonus features are kind of not there.  There's a trailer and a documentary that's kind of fun to watch because... well, because it's unwatchable.  The editor went to town with it apparently.  It's a documentary filmed eight years after the film was released (2000) and it's a kind of ""where are they now"" thing.  Too bad you only get one or two words out of these people before the editor decides to cut to another Twin Peaks actor.

If you like David Lynch, Twin Peaks (but don't expect it to be the same), or just want a movie to fool around with your head, buy this.  A great movie, a good DVD.",1099872000,3,1731,4.430379746835443
681070,4,6303515304,"You know, if there ever was a director that I fully understood why people weren't into his works, that director would be David Lynch. Lynch's movies, with the exception of his excellent Disney escapade ""The Straight Story"", are frustrating unless you know what your getting into, are dense and heavy with imagery, and he spends little to no time expaining to you what these images mean, and he I don't really think he cares whether or not you get them or not. So I don't think your wrong if you don't dig the man. Just not into his flicks. Me? I think the dude's a genius.

""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"", David Lynch's big screen prequel to his phenomnally successful, is Lynch at his most Lynchiest: the movie makes little sense if you're not willing to pay attention, is full of strange and at times complex imagery, is dark and at times disturbing and at other times funny. The movie was generally lambasted upon its release, hated by fans of the show. The movie is like the show with the volume turned all the way up and shot in a dark, rainy alleyway.

But that's what makes ""FWWM"" such a good movie. The movie infurated its audience when it first came out(though in retrospect I bet many people who hated it have grown to see its point), and can be openly interpreted by anyone. Its not as cold as ""Lost Highway"", or as intriguing as ""Mullholland Drive"", but is still a movie that requires you to watch it one hundred percent from beginning to end.

The acting in the film is all top notch, as is the camera work, but the real star of this movie, as in many of Lynch's crazy opuses, is musician Angelo Badalmentti, whose score evokes images in your mid that aren't even in the movie. The music he composes goes from dark and ambient to typical jazz suites to upbeat numbers without blinking, and all give the scenes that they are in a different mood and feel. To see how music can affect a scene or even an entire movie, ""FWWM"" is essential viewing.

This movie isn't for everyone. The people who dislike aren't necessarily wrong, this just isn't their cup of coffee. But ""FWWM"" is a fascniating look at the underbelly of suburbia, and is one of Lynch's best flicks yet.

681119,4,6303515304,"Shot after the series was cancelled because there was a demand overseas for more ""Twin Peaks"" material, ""Fire Walk with Me"" gives us a glimpse of what occurred just prior to Laura Palmer's murder in the pilot. While it spells out some things only hinted at in the pilot and is even more surreal, ""Fire Walk with Me"" also has the benefit of being a theatrical film and, as such, is allowed to be even stranger than the series in many respects.

The first thirty minutes of the film are devoted to a murder similar to Palmer's that occurs in another town. A pair of FBI agents are sent in to investigate (Chris Issak and Keifer Sutherland). When they run into resistence from the local law enforcement, they're forced to flex their FBI muscles a bit. While investigating a clue in a trailer park, one of the agents vanishes. Agent Cooper (MacLachlan)is called in to find the missing agent.

Far more surreal than the series with a number of high profile cameos (David Bowie, Harry Dean Stanton), this is a bit more bizarre as well when compared to the series (and even the pilot). The DVD is chapter encoded (unlike the frustrating ""Mulholland Drive""), has an original documentary that's shot in a style like Lynch might have used with the original cast (save Piper Laurie, Michael Ontkean, Jack Nance and a couple of other cast members)about the impact of the show.

It's a strange but compelling companion piece to the pilot and the series. Picture quality is good although it could probably be improved with a new transfer. Audio sounds quite good with a nice 5.1 mix.

The extras include a documentary on the making of the film and theatrical trailer. There are deleted scenes for the show that aren't included here and I'd be curious to see them reintegrated or the longer cut that Lynch assembled put together for DVD/Blu-ray.

A solid cast with a good script that meanders a lot (but, hey, it's Lynch not exactly a director known for narrative clarity or straight forward stories), ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me"" plays better than parts of the first season but isn't quite as strong as both the pilot and first 8 episodes of the series. It's still worthwhile for fans of the show. However, be prepared to have more mysterious loose ends revealed.

As stated closely by another: Don't walk into a Dali exhibit and expect English countryside. Treat this movie, and any other David Lynch movie the same. His characters are among the most real that unreal can get, and Fire Walk With Me is no exception. Expect ""weird"" and every synonym of this; It's amazing what Lynch's imagination can muster up. This movie nags at the leach of sanity.",1087084800,2,831,4.333333333333333

681122,5,6303515304,"I came into watching the series of Twin Peaks as a fan of Lynch's intuitively absurd filmmaking style.  I found the series to be rock solid for the first 20 episodes (sorry, but most of the latter episodes (the finale excluded) were too drawn out and could have been easily compressed into two or three episodes). However, I found the merely occasional spattering of Lynch's trademarked imagery, cinemetography and irony too infrequent to satisfy what I had grown to love about his work.
Fire Walk With Me made up for all of this quite nicely.
Everything a hardcore Lynch fan waited several episodes at a time to see in the show is rampant throughout this movie.  From the get-go, Lynch's frantic pace of contextualless imagery, oddly presented characters and dark humor blend together into a mix that satisfies both those interested in the Twin Peaks mythology and those who want to see an engaging film.
Personally, I found this film to be one of Lynch's finest, right alongside Eraserhead.

Definitely not for everyone (and not for Children) but if you are a fan of Lynch this is a 'must see' even if you did not see Twin Peaks. This is on my top 10 list of films ever made. However, I have very specific tastes. As an example, when I saw this, I was up all night thinking, as this film affected me so deeply. It is disturbing, funny, and brilliant, occasionally overacted but overall a masterpiece.

681194,3,6303515304,"Although it is exciting to have this prequel released on DVD, hard-core fans will be disappointed at the lack of special features on this DVD. Fire Walk with Me was originally scripted to be a 3 hour film. The final release of Fire Walk with Me was cut down to just under 2 hours. This editing causes the film to have lost that something special that the series had. It would have been nice if all those deleted scenes had come out on this DVD, so we could finally see the lost footage. To truly understand the film, its almost necessary to read the full script. Also, with all Lynch DVD's so far, there is no director commentary. However, there are some fun aspects to the DVD. Some excellent interviews, and a good quality transfer of the film.
Moira Kelly has replaced Lara Flynn Boyle as Donna Hayward, which is a little disappointing, but Sheryl Lee is fantastic, as is Lynch, once again as Gordon Cole, Coopers boss at the FBI. There are also some great cameo's by David Bowie, and Kiefer Sutherland. Anyone interested in Laura Palmers or Dale Coopers life could also read ""The secret diary of Laura Palmer"" or ""the autobiography of Dale Cooper"". Both excellent books. Fire Walk with Me on DVD is a must have for any Twin Peaks fan - it has all the greats - the red room, lots of donuts, and those interesting characters that keep you glued to the TV when watching Lynch's genius work - the mysterious Twin Peaks.",1067040000,,1419,4.482625482625482

That's completely absent here. Total lack of likelyhood.
A lot of people who seems taken by a madhouse (F.B.I. agents too!...may I say particularly?) and some ""being"" who could well be find into a Hyeronimus Bosch painting!!!
Poor Laura Palmer painted as a girl that pass her time sniffing cocaine and f...ing every guy who meets her!!! Not to mention the changing of Donna Hayword actress, and the absence of Sheriff Truman, Josie Packard and Ben Horne (three important characters of T.P.)!
More: in T.P. Laura is supposed to be under psycho-therapy, but where is Dr. Jacobi? Laura's father is supposed to be a properly qualified lawyer, but in this movie even an idiot could see that he's completely fool!!!
The movie turns in a psychedelic adventure since the beginning and shows an oneiric world cutting off almost every contact with real world, ...Twin Peaks had it's oneiric face too, but it was much more controlled and well integrated in the history that neverthless remained pretty much real.
I'm not happy to give this opinion because I really loved T.P. and still loving it (by the way, I've buy the DVD 1st season: fantastic, with a lot of extras) ...but sincerely I'd expected something more from a director like David Lynch.
The movie, that I bought because as a ""T.P. fan"" I couldn't miss it, was quite a disappointment to me.",1066348800,,1570,4.754578754578755
681196,4,6303515304,"After suffering with an awful pan and scan copy on VHS for many years, this DVD comes as a welcome relief and also as a bitter pill. While Lynch personally worked on the print of this film and the transfer is superb -- both visually and audibly -- the lack of extras is somewhat of a let down.
Lynch's films are always a visual feast and FWWM is no different. Take a look at the scene in the Red Room, the Canadian bar with headache-inducing strobes, and you'll see what a great job Lynch and co. did on the transfer of this movie. The audio too, is wonderful. Angelo Badalamenti's soundtrack comes through loud and crystal clear and also is quietly atmospheric when it needs to be.
As for the extras. The infamous battle with CIBY 2000 over the rights for the film's much balleyhooed deleted scenes has been covered exhaustively elsewhere so I won't get into it, suffice to say that their exclusion is sorely missed. Instead, we get an offbeat and amateurishly done documentary by the usually reliable Mark Rance (his doc on the Magnolia DVD is top notch!). It's unfocused and makes sense only to the most die hard Twin Peaks/Lynch fan.
And that's it. No surprise that Lynch is not a big fan of DVD supplemental material, which is why the best DVDs of his movies are the ones he didn't have direct control over (i.e. the wonderful Blue Velvet Special Edition).
Still, the movie is the important thing and on this level, the DVD does not disappoint. Hopefully, at some point, Lynch will work out the legal issues and new, Special Edition of this underrated masterpiece will be released.",1066176000,,1586,4.588028169014085

Fire Walk With Me is the prequel to the Twin Peaks series, even though it was released after the show was finished.  The story sets the tone for the entire series, and is about the death of the one and only Laura Palmer.  Ray Wise and Kyle MacLachlan give great turns, and the always dependable Harry Dean Stanton gives a short but memorable performance.  Though it doesn't explain much other than the circumstances involving Laura Palmer's death, the Lynch hallucinatory tone throughout the entire film really captivates and mystifies.  The DVD is good for the film and has an interesting documentary concerning the film and the TV series with many of the cast members discussing the wonder of Twin Peaks.

681198,3,6303515304,"I'm sure a lot of people have asked what went wrong with ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walks with Me."" It adds nothing new to the brilliance of the series and it's purpose seems to be to show the audience what kind of person Laura Palmer was, which we already pick up from the series. Story and characters are sacrificed for the purpose of shocking people with Laura Palmer's actions, but it just doesn't work. Things are vulgar, annoying, and often hard to take. Plus, since we already know who killed Laura Palmer (from the TV series), there is nothing new to be said.
The film is too long for its own good, with the entire 20 odd opening minutes a pointless addition to the rest of the story; it just slows things down and becomes boring. While entertaining at times, especially when Laura Palmer comes into the picture (after the excruciating start), this was extremely disappointing. It seems the whole concept of Twin Peaks has went to David Lynch's head a little bit. This being the movie, David Lynch decided to turn up the sexual antics and the bizarre plot.
Aside from that, the setting is breathtaking and bizarre all at once, and Sherly Lee is just superb as Laura Palmer. However, this just doesn't do any justice whatsoever to the TV series.",1058054400,,1243,4.603603603603603
681199,5,6303515304,"If this is your first encounter with  ""TPFWWM"", it is most likely a result of being exposed to Lynch from another of his movies.  As far as I am concerned, Lynch doesn't get any better than this.  I first saw this movie in 1993 in a big single screen theatre from the late 40's, and I had never seen an episode of ""Twin Peaks"" on TV at that point.  The effect of seeing this movie (without any expectations) on a huge screen and hearing the score on a theater sound system was the strongest single movie experience I have ever had...it stayed with me for days, and made me watch the video more than any other one I owned.  ""TPFWWM"" delves deeply into the world of darkness and shadows within our own minds while still believing in the concepts of love, family, God, friendship, and small town values.  Admittedly, it is bizarre, but most Lynch movies are.  Admittedly, it is different from much of the ""Twin Peaks"" TV show (which I watched every episode of AFTER I saw this movie), but that is what you would expect from Lynch on going from TV to cinema, where he didn't have to censor his excesses and lighten his mood.  Admittedly, the DVD doesn't have almost any ""extras"", but this is typical of Lynch and, therefore, renders attempts to compare it to other DVD's with numerous ""extras"" irrelevent.  The greatness of this DVD is the movie itself.  You will feel like you are in an alternate universe seeing this movie (a world of blue?), and then think it could happen right down the street.  ""TPFWWM"" majorly influenced what Lynch eventually did with ""Mulholland Drive"", and it is no greater stretch than much of ""The X-Files"".  Aside from all of its oddities though, ""TPFWWM"" has some of the most affecting moments that have ever been filmed:  the opening credits rolling with the bleakly beautific theme song in the background (which again set the stage for ""Mulholland Drive""), the chilling autopsy of Teresa Banks, the bizarre appearance of Agent Jeffries, the believable scene of Laura sniffing coke in the school bathroom, the haunting look on her face and sound of her voice when she talks to Donna about falling in space, the creepiness of the Palmer's empty house, the almost insane look in her father's eyes at the dinner table...I could go on and on and give a lot of the plot away.  All I will say at this point is that if you appreciate Lynch's ability to make a moment in a movie resonate with unique poigniancy or if you can appreciate surrealism, this movie is a must see.  The DVD is a great picture transfer, so it is worth having even if it did turn down the soundtrack a bit (and drop the subtitles in the Pink Room scene), so it is worth replacing the video with.  Lynch may not release any version but this, and, if he does, it may be a LONG time from now (knowing him), so enjoy this now for what it is...a combination of unparalleled surrealism and romantic idealism that is on a clear DVD picture.

I gotta say that I enjoy the whimsy of the original series more than this darkly fantastic movie, but this film is a necessary piece of the puzzle, and in that regard, I love it.  If your a fan of Twin Peaks and have not yet seen Fire Walk With Me, it's a must-see... just get ready for the weirdness of the Twin Peaks series, amplified by 10 and minus most of the townspeople.  This is Laura's movie.  Yeah, it was kind of hard for me to get past how different the movie was in comparison to the network televison show.  But Lynch had no tv restrictions when he undertook this project, and was able to show us the things we could only imagine during the series...this movie is messed up, but just realize that it's necessary in illustrating how messed up Laura's world was, it's like a work of art that's hard to look at, but must be closely examined nonetheless...it explains so much of Laura's last days, and at the same time stands alone as it's own haunting story...",1047254400,,1392,4.261363636363637

The latter portion, dealing with Laura Palmer, mostly just put into pictures what had been revealed through conversation in the series. I feel this was a mistake: it didn't contribute much that was new, and defined scenes that should have been left to the imagination.
That being said, if they re-release this with the 2 hours of extra footage (with some scenes from the first part of the film) I would buy the FWWM dvd.",1046822400,,704,4.551181102362205

I also received something I did NOT ask for, ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"".  Being one of those original fans who never missed an episode that first year only to be disenfranchised the following with the move to Saturday nights and the noticeable dip in quality, I, like so many, never bothered to catch 'Fire' when it was released.  The reviews were so hideous I felt it best to hold on to the admission fee for a more noteworthy expense, say a piece of pie and a hot cup of coffee.
After watching the pilot and the entirety of season one, with great expectations I loaded the 'Fire' disc.  As it whirled to life, I reclined backwards, settling in for more Lynchian delight!
Liver and onions, specifically liver, has always been one of the least favorite things to put in my mouth.  As a kid, my mom made it for dad infrequently, he being the only one in the household to tolerate it.  Everytime it sizzled in the pan alongside the company of onions, I betrayed my memory and yearned to have some, it smelled that good.  But everytime was the same: it blew.
""Fire Walk With Me"" is liver and onions.  Built upon the promise of everything that had gone before it, I couldn't help expecting a tasty dish to sate my art house appetite.  Instead, liver and onions.
This prequel, despite the opinions of a dozen hardcore fans, is a nonsensical mess missing entirely the tightness, intelligence, and lushness of the ""Twin Peaks"" I came to love.  After a promising first half hour, the film goes into a steep, unrecoverable dive of craziness that is not edgy or interesting, just silly.
Whereas the original featured a fuller cast with tantalizing, cameo-like camera time, Sheryl Lee, fine as a stiff or in a minor supporting role, is called upon to carry this film and breaks under the weight of it.  Stunningly, her character, as well as the rest of the cast, is not crafted well enough to hold your attention and her performance is alternately wooden and over animated and ultimately unbelievable.
I wanted to love this film.  I expected to wholeheartedly.  But you cannot, in my humble opinion, substitute loveable quirkiness with flat out weirdness and call it good, David Lynch or not.  ""Fire Walk With Me"" has to go down as one of the major film disappointments of all time, a very bad film easily earning its place on All Time Top Ten Worst lists world wide.

It's a good film, yes.  Has some maddening quirks, but mind you I almost slugged a guy in LA who yelled at me that TPFWWM: ....
The unconventional, even at times seemingly lackodasical, editing manages to achieve its own logic after a couple of viewings, especially for those who grew up with the foreign cinema of the 50s and 60s and haven't been sucked into thinking Tarantino is actually original or smart.
Lynch's deconstructivist slant on the  50s sensibility continues. Yes, he likes his Milkshake Dreams, I think, but he's artist enough to know they are still notions and dreams.  It's always nice to ponder the beauty of Sheryl Lee, and Chris Isaak is no slouch as eye candy, either.
Beneath it all is a story of child abuse, of America eating its young, of small towns turning on their own progeny. ....
Maybe.
Brilliant moments of staging and mood abound.  A Few ""Silencio"" status scenes dot the film:  Laura in the Black Lodge, Chris Isaak and Sherriff Cable, Chris in the Coffee Shop, David Bowie materializing in and out of this dimension for a few moments and screaming, and a very terrifying death scene.  The best however is a little trans-dimensional trip Laura takes into the Black Lodge Bob World where the Dancing Dwarf is up to no good as usual.
Angelo mixes a good score of neo-jazz, but my big qualm with the film is Bobby doing that dance-jig backwards in the school yard, or is that Laura tweaking out on coke and imagining Bobby walking backwards?  Lynch will never tell.

681256,3,6303515304,"By now you know that this film is a feature-length prequel to the ""Twin Peaks"" series, which I loved. Lynch junks everything that made the show fun and cryptic, leaving a movie that's just cryptic and interminable. We meet Laura Palmer, an outwardly happy and beautiful girl with a none-too veiled dark side. We also meet her father - yeah, we knew him from the show already, but he's a different person entirely around his daughter. Cooper also figures prominently, as does his boss, Gordon Cole (Lynch, himself). The film begins with the FBI investigating a murder committed under circumstances similar to those that will mark Laura Palmer's death - this one looked at by agents Chester ""Chet"" Desmond (Cris Izak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland). Looking alone into a lead near the victim's trailer park home, Desmond dissappears, leaving the FBI to scramble for a solution before the killer makes an all-but-certain reprise. After an interlude in which Cooper briefly finds and then loses missing Special Agent Phil Jeffries (David Bowie), the film shifts to Laura Palmer's last days - of trying to confess her fears and pain to her best friend Donna (Moira Kelly, replacing Lara Flynn Boyle), taunted by Killer BoB, molested repeatedly by her father, and drawn deeper into a world of sex and drugs. To Laura, Donna stands for the purity she herself has lost. Though she knows her inescapable fate will be a violent death, she holds out hope for a pure redemption.
This was a frustrating film. Diehards can blame the panning on lazy fans who wanted a clearer story, but ""Fire Walk With Me"" got off to easily on that score. When the film starts, and until David Bowie's exit, this was a tense and scary film, perfectly mixing sound effects, music, cinematography and script to make for a truly chilling film. There are hints that the Feds know more than they're letting on - one of Cole's assistants wears a pin with a flower that we later learn has become emblematic for BoB's crimes. The David Bowie scene is not only cryptic, but incomprehensible - Bowie appears in one of Cooper's dreams, one set in the FBI's office. Because Coop relates his dream to Cole in an FBI office, it's hard to see at first where the dream ends. The chill of Bowie's 30 second performance - of a man who's managed a brief escape from some otherworldly prison - overcomes just how hard a sequence it is to follow. Then it goes downhill, and the film becomes an unending look at Laura Palmer, filling in some gaps but not creating any mystery. Even the not scary parts - pairing Southerland and Izak's as feds tracking the earlier murder in another remote northwest town - could have carried the film. But Lynch abandons that too. If anything, the film isn't too vague, but actually tells too much. There are a few scary bits (Annie, who ended the series trapped with Cooper in the Red Lodge, puts in an appearance to warn Laura), but never reclaims the dark spirit lost earlier in this movie.",1032220800,4,2978,4.706896551724138

I guess a combination of these elements was a good idea because the pilot and first season of the show were rivetting. I was hooked.  I was dying to hear agent Coopper tell me who killed Laura Palmer.  But  the first season ended on a cliff hanger.  The show was not a murder mystery anymore; Twin Peaks was a soap opera. I have seen hundreds of murder myteries and I have never watched one that lasted more that two hours.  As the series dredged along I lost interest.  In fact, Agent Cooper did not solve the case until episode twelve.
Fire Walk With Me must be the low point of David Lynch's career.  This is a B-movie.  It was just thrown together to answer the thousands of people saying ""What the hell?!""  Fire Walk With Me makes no sense.  The motive of the killer is diferent in the movie than in the series.  It has alot of loose ends.  Chris Isaak and David Bowie are completely insignificant to this program.  Essentially this show ruined the entire series for me.

in the gaps, sets the stage for murder and vice, then
provides telling reinforcement of Laura's character.
Perhaps an even greater hero of the story than you would
have thought otherwise!  Her personal struggle against
demonic possession shows us that not only did no one really
know the real Laura Palmer, but that we were ALL wrong
about her.  Fiercely talented writing and directing make this
DVD a must whether you're a Twin Peaks addict or just want
to see David Bowie's eerie cameo.",1027987200,3,750,4.7984496124031

Yet a few weeks later for some reason I was propelled to watch it again and I loved it.  It is definately the most distubing movie that I have ever seen yet it is also the compelling film I have ever seen. The unique fashion in which the story unwinds and the odd story twists.  It is really a work of genious.  A very disturbed genious.  I just loved that scene in the Canadian bar.  One of the coolest ever.

This DVD, however, is only so-so.  I totally disagree with his policy of not having chapter selection.  Why not?  Sometimes idiosyncratic is just idiotic. If it comes from some sort of artistic integrity, something about the purity of form, then it shouldn't be on home video to begin with.  It's nothing more than a poor decision made on tenuous artistic and intellectual grounds.
I love the movie and would have bought it even if I'd have known about the chapter issue.  Coming as a surprise as it did just totally irritated me.

681294,4,6303515304,"A) If you've had very little experience with the series, you're more likely to like this film.  It is much more connected to Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive (and stylistically forms a trillogy with them the main recurring elements being a deranged voyeuristic male and a starlet that keeps changing from blonde to brunette).
B) Fire... leaves you with a strange sinking feeling of redemption.  The only experience comparable was the last major car accident that I was in.
C) It is terrifically beautiful.
I also want to mention that the documentary is the most Lynch-ian thing I've seen and I'm amazed to hear his ""fans"" say they hate it.  Non-linear, subjective, and very very funny while also illuminating and ironicly dark.  That's Lynch and the documentary in a nutshell.",1023235200,3,777,4.953846153846154
681295,5,6303515304,"As a fan of the Twin Peaks series, I was somewhat disappointed with Fire Walk With Me on first viewing. However, I now own the DVD, and upon repeated viewings I rank this film among Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive as the director's finest. I find Laura Palmer's final week alive and her descent into near madness to be absolutely fascinating. I love the bizarre dreamlike sequences and the strange clues that Lynch gives us: the ring, the Indian whooping sound, the writing on the missing FBI Agent's car, the burning smell, the old woman and the boy in the white mask, and David Bowie. All of these elements, as well as a super-surreal scene in a Canadian nightclub, make for one of Lynch's most intriguing mind-f***s.

A warning to die-hard Twin Peaks fans, Fire Walk With Me is very different from the series in terms of tone. While the series had a very darkly comic tone, the film's tone is just plain dark(Except for the Chris Isaak/Keifer Sutherland prologue). But think about it, the film covers the events that lead to Laura Palmer's emotional breakdown and eventual murder. How is one supposed to make that humorous? And to fans of Kyle Maclachlan's Agent Cooper, savor every scene he's in, because he ain't in that many. But at least he, unlike many of the show's other regulars, actually appears in the film.

But with this said, Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch's brilliant portait of a doomed and psychologically tortured girl and is a must own for every Lynch/Twin Peaks enthusiast. Anyone else though, might find themselves asking, ""What the hell is Garmonbozia?""",1023235200,6,1580,4.762773722627737

It is not that Fire Walk with Me is a bad movie.  It is similiar in tone to David Lynch's other work.  But he abandons many of the story lines from the series.  And, perhaps more confusing, he chooses a completely different tone and feel for the movie that at times seems heavy handed and bizzarre without the orignal's eccentric characters and offbeat humor.
Still, the ultimate conclusion to the question ""Who killed Laura Palmer"" is satisfying and consistent with the plot lines from the series.  It's just handled in such a dark and dreary fashion that is very inconsistent with the show.",1021420800,4,817,4.856115107913669

She's leading a secret life, turning tricks to support a cocaine habit, and losing her mind.  Since the age of 12 a man she knows as ""Bob"" has been molesting her.  The closer she gets to figuring out who Bob is, the nuttier she gets.  I think Fire Walk With Me has more bizarre ""dream"" sequences than the entire Twin Peaks series.  Very bizarre stuff.  I've been a fan of David Lynch for a long time, but I don't watch t.v.  So I never saw Twin Peaks while it was airing.  I did see Fire Walk With Me shortly after its release.  Another great David Lynch film (my favorite is still ""Blue Velvet""), I was especially drawn in by Sheryl Lee's performance.  This film is what turned me on to Twin Peaks.  Not the other way around.  Luckily my sister-in-law had almost every episode on video.  I don't have the usual complaints about certain Twin Peaks characters not being in Fire Walk With Me.  This movie is all about Laura Palmer's last days, which is interesting enough.  However, it would have been nice to see some deleted scenes from Fire Walk With Me.  If Lynch had at least 4 hours, there had to have been something of value that got cut.  It's dvd, so why not?",1018915200,4,1304,4.407563025210084

I have not seen the series from which this film originated, and was unsure whether the movie would make much sense without it, but my apprehension soon gave way to jaw dropping awe as this incredible story played out. Fire Walk with Me was a revelation.
Sheryl Lee's criminally ignored performance is so emotionally wrenching as she disappears into Lynch's nightmare rabbit hole that I'm left gobsmacked that she isn't the kind of megawatt movie star she clearly deserves to be.

Frankly it didn't need these things, as a matter of fact they probably would have hendered it's goal of showing our beloved Laura's last days.  Anyways, as a stand alone film it is simply
amazing.  My god whenever I see David Lynch let loose on celluloid i get a funny tingling feeling in my heart.  His are movies of pure expression, and that is true art.  One note though, I have not noticed anywhere that someone has noticed, but is it just me or are the vocals during the ""orgy"" scene louder on the DVD than in any other release?",1017619200,2,842,4.180124223602484
681303,3,6303515304,"First off, I'm not as disturbed by the lack of deleted scenes as many of the other reviewers. While it would certainly be interesting to have them in an extras section, Lynch made the right decision in editing most of them out, as the finished film focuses much more on Laura Palmer's story without the material involving other characters. (Still, they would've made a better extra than the incompetent ""documentary""; the first-season DVD set makes far better use of material from these same interviews.)
Fortunately, the movie itself looks great-- the transfer is easily superior to the old laserdisc edition, with vibrant colors and pin-point visual clarity. What's odd is the sound mix, which I've noticed a number of other reviews comment on. It's well known that Lynch intentionally obscured the dialogue in the Canadian bar scene, to make the atmosphere all the more realistic (and oppressive)-- so why's the dialogue now mixed LOUDER than the music? It's even stranger because elsewhere the sound is identical to previous releases-- even in that scene where Philip Jeffries is rambling on about Judy and ""their meetings"" while we see the room above the convenience store. (Though I could've sworn that when the monkey says ""Judy"" near the end, it's a shade louder.) I can't believe Lynch personally approved this sound mix, because it makes a mockery of his original design.
That said, if you love this movie, this DVD's pretty much the only option at the moment. But if you have the laserdisc, don't get rid of it just yet.",1017100800,2,1531,4.937984496124031
681328,3,6303515304,"For the first time in my buying DVDs I can finally say I want a new edition! (Usually, I buy a movie and get irritated, no matter what the special features are on the new one, because usually they have acceptable features on the first edition...)
First of all, my rating is for the DVD, the film alone is worth five stars. The movie is excellent (and it is suggested you watch the series first - starting with the pilot episode, of course), the acting surperb. Everything is fine. Laura Palmer meets her doom, setting up the series' ""wrapped in plastic"" story line center piece. However, there is one problem....
The DVD comes with this ""original"" documentary. Fine. After all, the documentary on the first season DVD was by far the best documentary I've seen in years - the complete ""where are they now"" thoughts, very realistic, very soothing....often touching. However, this documentary not only has the same rehash (literally, a lot is the same footage!) but also is edited very poorly. The first season DVD had sophisticated editing - spliced together where it should belong, giving us a montage of interviews - very artful. This time around - it is chopped together so rapidly, the viewer is unable to understand what the phrase the actor just said had to do with the film, or even what the segway, if any was supposed to be.....If it didn't have this documentary the DVD would be acceptable, but why taunt the audience with something that screams, ""This is all you're going to get - yes I know it [stinks]; deal with it!"" (Another negative point is at a certain part of the movie there is subtitles, which now that it's ""remastered"" there is no longer a need for them, and sadly so, in my opinion.)
A movie like this deserved so much better. Plain and simple. And that's not even going into the deleted scenes.....which are absent. Okay, maybe David Lynch doesn't want them included, I don't know. But usually they are not inserted into the film, and could at least give the viewer the chance to decide for themselves what should have or shouldn't have been included and the film and perhaps understand why some things were cut. But really, that's fine that the scenes are absent. I understand that. And after all, more importantly, this is a piece of art, and speaking as an artist, if I'm satisfied with my artwork (which I'm assuming David Lynch is), I wouldn't change it for anyone. So I can understand, no matter how much it furiates me. Besides, the deleted scenes are mostly of the cast of the series, most of who are absent in this film.....but the series was about Twin Peaks - the odd things happening there. Laura Palmer was the introduction - the reason to meet the rest of the town. With her alive, this film should really be about her, and the assembly cast would detract.
Now that I think about it, the only good thing, besides the movie, of course, is the trailer. Perhaps one of the most moving trailers ever (next to ""Requiem for a Dream"").
One last comment though, the DVD does feature chapter stops. No, it doesn't have scene selection - although your remote will come in handy....it's easy, just press the numbers on it!!! And the names of the chapters.....do they really matter in the first place? The chapters have numbers! So, to those people complaining - get over it. (The movie ""Cube"" didn't even come with a booklet inside, so hey, what's worse...?)
Basically, the movie is great. Enchanting and distrubing all at the same time. Truly a fine piece of art. The problem is the documentary doesn't show it. It's a total insult. Hopefully a new edition will be released (along with the pilot episode [although for now we have the import...] and season two....). Until then, we'll pay out the money if we're fans. After all, everyone wants their cup of ""damn fine coffee""....just be warned....this time ""there's a fish IN the perculator!""",1015891200,,3868,4.673020527859237
681329,4,6303515304,"I agree with the other viewer. What is probably the best part of the movie has been changed. In the old mix subtitles helped the viewer to understand what people were sayng in the Canadian Bar scene  but in this version they are useless. Dialogue is perfectly understandable and the music not so loud.
I Don't believe Lynch personally approved the sound remix since he is the sound designer of all his movies. I think he only supervised or approved the fantastic video transfer.
Maybe I am too perfectionist but...I will always watch this dvd playng the audio track from the old dolby surround Laserdisc (in perfect sync of course) This is the only reason for which I give this DVD 4 stars instead of 5. This movie is great!!!

He did the final cut on this film. That is what he had envisioned. I am not going to question that. The picture and sound are very good, although I could have done without the widescreen.

I adress the comments of the angry consumer below.
1. ""There are no deleted scenes""

  Old news.  New Line Fine Line Old Line Dumb Line
2. ""There are no Lynch intereviews""
  Those in the know are aware the Lynch hates to discuss
  his work, has never appeared in a traditional interview ,
  and has not appeared on any of the Lynch discs released
  thus far.  In 1991, as the first season drew to a close,
  the cast appeared on (I think it was) Donahue(?)  Mark
  Frost was the authority at this interview.  Lynch did not
  come. Incidentally, during the show, word came in that
  they were  picked up for a 2nd season.  Frost had to run
  to rewrite the season ending to launch it into the (oft
  criticized) entirely underrated, brilliant 2nd season.
3.  ""There are no extras.""
  Yes there are.  There's the crummy documentary.
4.  ""This DVD doesn't even come with chapter selections""
  On the box for the DVD of Lynch's ""Staight Story"" he
  states that he does not believe a film should be split into
  chapters.  A film is a continuos piece and should be
  viewed that way.  The FWWM disc has no chapter
  titles, but it does have chapters that you can skip to
  different parts of the movie with.  The ""Straight Story"" disc
  has only one chapter.  If you turn off your DVD before the
  last half hour of the film, you have to fast forward through
  an hour and a half to get to where you left off.
4.  ""I assume a new DVD will make its way out soon.""
  Pipe dream.
My only complaint about this disc is the ""Lynch-approved"" re-mix.  This is only in terms of the Canadian Bar scene.  In the past the music was so loud you could barely hear what was being said.  The subtitles were necessary to understand the words. This is exactly what being in a loud bar with a live band is like; one can barely hear the other people; even when shouting.  I miss this great effect.  It is one of my favorite sound gags in the history of film.
Oh well.  It could be worse.  And I would never deny myself this extraordinary, definitive transfer of this great film.  And at the end of the day, that's all that matters.  It is the film we are buying this disc for.  Not the chapter stops.  So, SILENCIO.

Also noteworthy is the great cinematography and the bold use of color.  On the downside, the ""documentary"" which features interviews with cast members is abominable.  The film is choppily edited and fast motion is used in one section, I suppose to create a ""cool"" and ""hip"" effect.

He removed them for a reason. The only reason any of us wanted to see them was because we were all jonesing for some more Peaks.
I'm personally glad to finally see the DVD out. If the deleted scenes had to be sacrificed to bring it out, then so be it. We're getting trailers, documentaries, etc. And it's on DVD. 'Nuff said.
This film is definitely not one of Lynch's best. It's definitely not the best representation of Twin Peaks as a whole. But it was a nice thing to have after the series was yanked out from underneath us! Overall, I very much appreciated the effort and have cherished the film ever since. The film got rather busy at times, and having to read subtitles for a whole ten minutes was frustrating (during the Canada scene, not the Lodge scene). But like I said, it was a nice thing to have after the fact, and I think it deserves an A for the mere effort!

681376,4,6303515304,"Earlier reviews here suggest that this DVD release of ""Fire Walk With Me"" seems destined to be completely swamped by controversy regarding New Line's decision to release it without the infamous deleted scenes (with the issue of the movie's quality playing second fiddle). In defense of New Line, it does seem unfair to accuse them of not caring about buyers when their DVD line probably offers the best overall balance between high-quality presentation and attractive pricing (their releases of ""Austin Powers"" and ""Wag The Dog"" come to mind). With regard to the question of quality, I'll admit up-front that one of the four stars I give ""FWWM"" is intended to help off-set the under-rating that some have given the release because of the deleted scenes issue.
This is by no means David Lynch's best work. It's not even his best ""Twin Peaks"" work. That honor falls to the second ""Twin Peaks"" episode that he directed (the one with Cooper's first dream sequence). It is, however, an interesting side-note to the world he created so vividly on TV.
Having said that, if you've never seen ""Twin Peaks"" before, this is probably not the place to start. While much of it holds up on its own as a thriller (perhaps even matching Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" for perversity), there are many elements, both in terms of plot points and visual poetics, that will leave the unconverted scratching their heads.
Lynch's choice to use his opportunity to make a ""Twin Peaks"" film to focus on the final days of Laura Palmer rather than tie up some of the loose ends left by the weekly series' abrupt ending was an odd one. The question of ""who killed Laura Palmer?"" was never really the point of the series but merely a loose frame-work to allow Lynch and his collaborators to explore the things that really interested them about the town of Twin Peaks.
Laura Palmer was really only interesting as a symbol of corruption hiding behind a virtuous veneer. This is not to take anything away from Sheryl Lee's excellent performance in the film, but Laura's only real purpose in the story is to be a victim. As a result, the resolution seems more obligatory than the inevitable progression of the drama, there's only so much Lynch's surrealistic touches can do to disguise it. The end result is a reasonably intriguing thriller, which falls smack in the middle of Lynch's film-work in terms of quality.",1010016000,4,2371,4.799511002444988
681377,3,6303515304,"It would be a horrible shame if the rumors were true, and New Line opted not to include the deleted scenes of Fire Walk With Me. Unfortunately, this appears to be the case according to the screenshots of the DVD's menu, available on dugpa.com. Dugpa.com offers links for letting New Line know what you think about this, but it's probably too late for our voices to make any difference in this matter.
The problem appears (according to New Line, to be taken with a grain of salt) to be rights issues, the same problems that tied up the pilot. CIBY originally owned the rights, but went under. MK2, a French company, bought the rights for the movie and were negotiating with New Line for their inclusion in the FWWM DVD.  Why it fell apart, nobody seems to know for sure.
The movie itself gets 5 stars. It will be nice to see it in restored glory, but the deleted scenes are what we've all been holding our breath for.

This was one hell of a ride to take and I have done it again and again. There is no need to have some of the principal characters of the series in the movie because it's better to wait for the series and meet these characters. The mystique of the man from another place and the red room are right there in this masterpiece of mystery and suspense. You meet Laura Palmer up close and personal. This movie is a brilliant depiction of the prom queen who was looking for true love but wanted to be wild. This movie is Lynch's best work and I will stick by those words because this film is what introduced me to Laura and the Twin Peaks television series. You are horrified, you cry and are deeply touched by the depiction of Laura's self destruction and it leads to what is revealed in the pilot and the other episodes.

i like twin peaks but some people dont.

fire walk with me shows us the last few days of laura palmers life and the night of her death.
Most of the original stars return and there are some notable guest appearances from Harry Dean Stanton, David Bowie, Chris Isaak, and Kiefer Sutherland.
This dvd does not have as many special features as it could but it does have some trailers and an original documentary from the cast.

681432,5,6303515304,"When this film was released in 1992, legions of fans booed Lynch for what he had done to their beloved little town. What he'd done was actually give you the town he couldn't give you on TV. I myself loved the show, and I loved the characters and the town and the ridiculous plots. It was captivating and intense viewing. But objecting to the film is to ignore what the series was really about.
We knew Laura was a cocaine addict. We knew she was a prostitute. We knew her father had sex with her. We knew everyone had sex with her. We knew she was beaten to death. We knew all this. So why, when we see these events happening in this prequel do so many people suddenly stand up and disown it. Is this violence not palatable enough for them? Is rape only okay when it's softened for TV? How pitiful we must be if these are the motivations for our disappointment; that murder and rape and incest, battery and prostitution and drug-addiction are unacceptable, except if they are gift-wrapped.
The first half-hour of FWWM is exemplary of this 'real' Twin Peaks. It is a microcosm of the whole series but in reverse. The FBI investigate the murder of a young woman in a small Northwest town. Except here, the local police are not friendly but fiercely threatening, the local diner is not the cosy RR where you can get Norma's damn fine cherry pie with two scoops of ice cream, and the comforts of the Great Northern are eschewed for the trash underclass of the trailer park. It is this we must face as the true Twin Peaks.
The film also completes the story, much as other might disagree. The final shot of Cooper and Laura in the Black Lodge is where it begins and ends. As Kyle MacLachlan revealed in a recent UK TV interview, 'it ends badly', with Cooper trapped here for 25 years, maybe more.
As for the DVD, fans can only hope and pray that New Line do include some of the many deleted scenes. These scenes feature no less than 12 (!) characters from the series whose cameos were cut from the final film. These scenes are the last we will see of anything new from Twin Peaks; let's just hope New Line get it right. The new documentary is sure to feature new interviews with casts members, but it is the cut scenes most fans will want to see. New Line have been trying to sort out the licenses for this DVD for over two years, and so far it appears they were not successful in negotiating the use of the scenes.

681433,5,6303515304,"Twin Peaks fans have had many reasons lately to rejoice. First, the Twin Peaks DVD Season 1 set, and now word that Fire Walk With Me will be released in February. However, the downside of both of these releases is that they've been criticized as being ""incomplete"". The Season 1 set (due to ownership rights) doesn't include the two-hour pilot episode. Likewise, at this point, it doesn't appear that the FWWM DVD will include the ""deleted scenes"" which were shot, but never included in the theatrical release. Since many of these scenes included regulars from the Twin Peaks series (such as Harry Truman and Josie Packard having a romantic picnic, not to mention the wonderful Sherilyn Fenn), Twin Peaks fans have been dreaming about this holy grail of Fire Walk With Me lore.
However, despite these deficiences, it is a joyous occassion to hear that FWWM, which essentially bombed in the theaters when it came out in 1992, is being released. One would assume that there isn't too great of a demand for this fairly unpopular movie. It has been derided as too obfuscating for non-peaks fans to follow.  But as a TP fan, I find this one of the greatest aspects of the film. Rather than ""watering down"" the surreal aspects of the t.v. series, in the hopes of reaping  profits from a mainstream audience, David Lynch didn't ""pull any punches"" on this thing. The weirdness and obscure references continue, even confusing die-hard Peaks fans at times (which I feel is one of the most special things about this film). Oftentimes, when a movie adaptation of a cult phenomenon such as this is released, it  usually attempts (overly so, at times) to ""wrap up all the lose ends"". Fire Walk With Me certainly depicts the answer to the question, ""Who killed Laura Palmer?"" However, its most remarkable characteristic is that it poses other more perplexing questions.
This movie is highly recommeded. Go ahead and preorder it, or buy it when it comes out in February. Hopefully, by putting our ""money where our mouths are"", Twin Peaks frans will be able to send a message to New Line and Artisan Entertainment showing that there is still (ten years later) a significant demand for Twin Peaks merchandise. Perhaps this may some day allow the ""uncut"" version of FWWM to be released, as well as the two-hour pilot episode, and the other episodes of the series (other than the first season).

Although the first third of the film is weird and witty, the rest is frightening and almost abusive to the viewer.  Longtime Twin Peaks fans cited a disapointment that many of the characters from the series were left out, and focusing on the elements at hand seemed to shift the focus far away from the anti-Mayberry of the Pacific Northwest.  If that is the case, then there is no way the movie could have succeeded, as it would have been too long to sit through and would have been able to focus on nothing.  Still, the film seems to waste time through many sections (the opening scenes, for instance) and hustle through meatier matters (such as the old woman and her grandson.)

Judging from the conversations taking place in the theater before and after the showing, we weren't the only ones obsessed with Lynch's classic television show.  The critics were harsh, as were most fans, and the film quickly faded from theaters.  Now it seems that only the aforementioned die-hards recall this film fondly.  Well, with the release of ""Mulholland Drive,"" and the subsequent critical praise (quite a shock, actually; hell, even Ebert gives it four stars, and that guy has never been a Lynch proponent), I believe that everyone who adores Lynch's latest should seek out ""Fire Walk With Me"" and view it with fresh eyes.  I won't delve too deeply into the plot; suffice it to say that those who claim this movie does not resolve the loose ends of the series are not correct (Cooper meets Cooper in the red room. Enough said.). Of all the Lynch films, this one has the best Badalamenti soundtrack and the most gorgeous, satisfying ending.  Like all of his films, its themes explore love, mortality, depravity, and the long, dark passageways of the soul.  It does lack most of the quirkiness and humor of the series.  It does lack many of the characters (although Leo and The Log Lady show up in very amusing cameo).  It does make the mistake of not showcasing more of Agent Cooper.  It contains many, many disturbing scenes that someone not familiar with Lynch might be tempted to label misogynist.  But it is ultimately Lynch's most passionate film, as the patient viewer is rewarded with a vision of redemption so powerful it lingers long after the credits have rolled.",1004140800,22,1668,4.7770034843205575

What this movie does is give some insight into who Laura was and what she was like.
Sheryl Lee is truly amazing as Laura Palmer. Not since Mia Farrow in ""Rosemary's Baby"" has an actress shown so much emotion and terror in her face. My favorite scene is when Laura walks into her house and up the stairs. The way that Lynch focuses simply on the whomph whomph of ceiling fan as Laura mounts the stairs to her room to find BOB is truly frightening.

To start with, if you haven't seen every episode, don't even bother with this one.  You simply won't get it.  Those that have seen the show still won't know what to make of alot of it.  The show was symbolic and interesting while this seems weird with no point.  This may be because a huge amount was cut from the film but in the end it makes little sense.

681515,4,6303515304,"Very few of David Lynch's films are perfect.  He seems to have trouble editing and structuring his films.  Having said that, I will also stress that very few of his movies are bad.  Lynch can paint very impressive scenes.  In this film there are several: the first thirty minutes, the Laura Palmer dream sequence, the bar-room scene, and the finale.
This movie is simply not good if one is not a fan of the TV series Twin Peaks.  But if you have seen the series it answers all the many questions posed by the series.
The first thirty minutes of the film are maybe the best 30 minutes of any film I have ever seen.  Two special agents travel to a bizarre little town to investigate a brutal murder.  They subtly move towards a truth that is much larger than they could suspect.  Foreboding is blended well with humor in these scenes, and the jazz soundtrack augments the excellent direction.
The rest of the film specializes in the oft repeated Lynchian theme: a person facing personal corruption.  Laura Palmer is a girl who has lost her innocence and is falling, as she says, without an angel to stop her.  Lynch treated this theme in Twin Peaks, and most brilliantly in Blue Velvet where the hero (played by the same actor) is thrust into a world of deviance mirrored only by the world of innocence that he comes from in order to save another fallen woman.",980035200,8,1358,4.506122448979592

Never seen Twin Peaks?  Then start with the TV series, which is also available on videocassette.
The reasons are simple.  Twin Peaks, like essentially all of David Lynch's work, is something that some folks love, some folks hate, and most folks (including me) don't really understand.
Either way, this movie is really something that you should only watch AFTER you've seen all or most of the TV series.  The reason is that lots of stuff won't make any damn sense otherwise, and if you watch this first then the series won't be nearly as interesting.
Personally, I found the show captivating and hypnotic, and while the movie was great I only gave it 4 stars because as a TP fan, I would really have rather seen what happened after the show was cancelled.  Instead, the movie is a ""prequel"", and if you were a huge fan you probably knew a lot of the backstory that the movie tells anyway.
So:  If you liked the show, go ahead with this movie, if you didn't, don't bother with it (you'll probably hate it even more) and if you've never seen it (you heathen!) then get the TV shows first.
Paul
Note on the TV show; there's a ""movie"" that purports to be the pilot episode.  It contains ""bonus extra footage"" that is a load of crap because it wasn't on the TV show originally.  The reason is simple; the show (as you might have heard) carried on for hours and hours before revealing the ""true killer"".
So for the boxed version of the ""pilot"" they wanted a clean-cut ending, and Lynch gave them one.  The best thing to do is to watch the boxed ""pilot"" and then stop it when you get to where someone digs up the heart necklace that Donna and James buried- from this point on, it's ""extra"" footage that in the context of the series doesn't make a lot of sense.",979430400,5,1847,4.4188790560471976
681517,3,6303515304,"Twin Peaks has legions of fans, myself included. The TV series was and still is one of the greatest and most original undertakings ever presented. Hidden messages and symbolism pervade this journey into what some have called the most cryptic TV show ever made. The film TP: Fire Walk With Me is a far different story.  A supposed prequel, it is in fact also a sequel of sorts that never resolves the real cliffhangers that are still hanging since the show abruptly ended in June of 1991. The first 20 minutes of this film is an interesting attempt to give some backstory to the Theresa Bank murder, but unfortunately goes on way too long, and with supporting characters that got on my nerves after five minutes.  Once we get to the town of Twin Peaks, we find that it looks nothing like it did in the TV series, which was one of its greatest virtues.  Sadly, some of the best characters from the series are not in this film, such as Audrey Horne, Sherriff Truman, Lucy, and Ben Horne.  In addition, some of the supporting characters who do show up are given little more than cameo roles.  As for the story, any film that purports itself to be a prequel to a TV series should be understood without having to see the material from which it was spawned.  If you did not watch Twin Peaks the series, you will have a diffcult time comprehending what's going on here.  Supposedly, the rough cut of this film was close to four hours, which is evident by the editing, which chops off scenes and joins conversations that obviously had already started.  Having said all that, I would give an oscar nomination to Sheryl Lee, who's performance in this film as Laura Palmer is a tour-de-force for this actress, who unfortunately, hasn't since gotten a role that comes anywhere close to allowing her to display the talents seen here.  Ray Wise as Laura's father Leland is also tremendous in this role, truly scaring the hell out of the viewer.  Now we come to the unforgivable sin: What the hell was Lynch thinking when he decided to put David Bowie in this movie?  Mr. Bowie is only in the film for 10 minutes but still manages to stink up the set every chance he gets. He simply doesn't belong here.  We do get to see Laura go to heaven, but what about Dale Cooper?  The most important character in Twin Peaks, his fate is never resolved, and most fans wanted that above all else.  Angelo Badalamenti's score is, as usual, one of the stars of this film, and adding Julee Cruise for a song at the roadhouse was another beautiful moment in this film. I only wish that the missing footage would somehow be available, or that the fate of Cooper could someday be resolved. My suggestion?.  Let the final chapter of Twin Peaks be concluded on the X-Files, with Scully and Mulder the ones who ultimately find the Black Lodge and Dale Cooper.",976147200,4,2822,4.5166994106090375
681518,5,6303515304,"This feature prequel to the series begins with a funny scene involving three FBI agents (one played by the director Lynch) and a strange dancing lady who uses some weird sign language. Then it becomes apparent that this film is going to be abstruse. Soon after this the other two FBI agents disappear inexplicably, and then we are intoduced to the central figure Laura Palmer (played well by Sheryl Lee) who we find has a dark side, which includes taking cocaine and prostitution. She is also troubled by visions of a demonic figure.
Some of the other sequences involve a strange little man, a one armed man, and a bizarre brief cameo from David Bowie; that surreal scene being the best one in the film. It is difficult to explain the purpose of these characters, but that is where the film suceeds with its stylish and surreal aberrations; another example being a scene in a bar where we can't hear the characters speak, and the film is slowed down with strobe lighting effects added. It concludes with seemingly a theme of salvation. It is a very stylish and surreal film.",969494400,3,1074,4.657894736842105
681519,5,6303515304,"FIGHT FOR THE DELETED SCENES!  In March of 2000, New Line DVD approached David Lynch and asked him if he would be willing to allow the release of  some of these deleted scenes to be included with their upcoming Twin Peaks:  Fire Walk With Me DVD. David Lynch gave the thumbs up, but only to add  these scenes as a supplement at the end of the disc. Mr. Lynch also  personally hand picked the scenes that he wished to be released with this  DVD.  Now at this time, it has been reported that New Line is currently in  negotiations with Ciby 2000 to acquire the rights to add these scenes to  their DVD release. However, in November of 1998, Lynch sued Ciby 2000 for  breach of contract and won a 6.5 million dollar settlement. At this years  Twin Peask Festival, it was revealed that Ciby in fact is asking way too  high of a price for these deleted scenes. (Almost as much as it would cost  to buy the rights to FWWM TWICE !) This may dissuade New Line from  purchasing these scenes. What we are trying to do is let New Line know in  massive, MASSIVE numbers how much we would like to have these scenes  included on this DVD, and that if they would purchase the rights to these  scenes, that we would be willing to pay extra to help defray costs. We are  hoping that if we can get enough people to politely write or email New Line  and let them know how important the inclusion of these scenes would be,  they will do what it takes to bring these deleted scenes to us on their  upcoming DVD. At this point, New Line will not confirm whether or not this  DVD will include these scenes. They have confirmed, however that the disc  will be out in the fourth quarter of 2000. (Hopefully a December 19th  planned release date) Although they have yet to make any announcement on  their website. Time is Running Out ! This is Probably THE Last Chance That  We Will Ever Have to See Anything ""New"" From the World of Twin  Peaks. We are urging you to write to New Line and let them know that you  want to see the Deleted Scenes to Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me !

681520,4,6303515304,"I was preparing to go back to college when I discovered Twin Peaks; I remembered my mom and others being obsessed with the program when it was  first on (I was ten and wasn't even allowed to watch). I had some time to  kill, and I love David Lynch's work, and so I rented the series pilot. I  was so intrigued that I rented the whole series and subsequently ""Fire  Walk With Me."" It was easily some of the more interesting hours of  television and film I've ever seen.
David Lynch is a brilliant man, but  his projects have been hit-and-miss affairs. He is incredibly ambitious and  creative, which has gotten him into trouble when he's taken on too much  (""Dune"" is the perfect example). On the other hand, Lynch can  produce works so vast and intriguing and admirable that they can only be  classified as the highest form of art (""Blue Velvet"" remains his  masterpiece). I'm still amazed with what David Lynch did to television--  the only contemporary series that rivals ""Twin Peaks"" in  narrative and creative brilliance is ""The Sopranos."" That said,  rent the series before you watch this movie.
""Fire Walk With  Me"" was another artistic risk on Lynch's part, and unless you're  familiar with the characters and events of the series don't waste your  time. But if you're a fan, this movie is a vital part of the canon. It  focuses on the weird characters, the mysteries, and the darkness that made  ""Twin Peaks"" oddly fascinating and inspired the cult following it  still maintains. Most of all, it focuses on Laura Palmer, the series' most  famous character who we never really got to know. She is here-- the  all-American girl who is secretly consumed by suffering, the  ""good"" girl all too familiar with evil. And of course there are  the spirits and demons-- Bob, the Midget, and the other inhabitants of the  Black Lodge, whose presences only fuel the mysteries they created.
I hope  David Lynch and the studio realize that there are still people discovering  this world, and that his achievement will continue to be admired by those  who seek intelligent and provocative entertaiment. When this DVD is  released, I hope it is everything these fans have been waiting for. And I  hope it answers one or two questions-- at least partially.",968198400,9,2247,4.731266149870801

I think it is a good idea to see the  series before you see the movie, you may or may not be confused, but the  bottom line is, it is a great movie.",963705600,,464,3.704081632653061

In no way did I expect the MOVIE  to be as good, and it wasn't even close, but that doesn't mean it wasn't  great LYNCH fare.
I own a copy of the book ""THE SECRET DIARY OF  LAURA PALMER"" from which some of the movie was based, it is VERY,VERY  good and a startling insight into the life of Laura Palmer.
The movie is  good,not great, but has some very memorable scenes and features a truly  amazing and underrated performance from SHERYL LEE as Laura in what had to  be a very tough role to play emotionally.
The scenes in the bar, the  traffic jam and the diner are very LYNCHIAN and impressive. I also really  enjoyed CHRIS ISAAK and KIEFER SUTHERLAND, and the scene with DAVID BOWIE  was so PEAKISH and GREAT.
This is definitely not a bad film, it's quite  good,especially for Peak's fans, of which there is no bigger one than me  anywhere.

I didn't see that series, know nothing of its characters, but was much impressed with the Lynch I'd seen to date  (Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart).  I took in the first part of the film  without a problem, smiling through much, and admiring Lynch's guts. Then  the real movie starts.  I didn't smile at anything else in the film. In  fact, I was emotionally numb for about two hours after it ended. I'd never  been so shaken by a film.  You need to love the main character, to feel  this much pain, and Sheryl Lee makes it easy. What does she say to her  ""true"" boyfriend--""The Laura you used to know doesn't exist  anymore. There's only me."" We get to see if not where the original  Laura went then why.

These beings  then pervert time and reality to carry out there own mystifying whims.  'Twin Peaks' is definetly Lynch's greatest work since his first film.  There are some increadible scenes in here.  Bowie's entrance into the FBI  headquarters and his bizarre story.  Cooper's confrontation with the man  from another place.

681642,3,6303515304,"Don't get me wrong. I heartly recommend this film to any TP fan, simply for the last 15 minutes. The unfortunate thing with this film (and indeed, to a degree, most of David Lynch's work) is that it will fail to hit you on  every level that Mr Lynch intended purely because it is so intrinsically  linked to him.
I do believe that only him himself understands this film  (even if some of the stuff isn't meant to be understood). But then, without  this, it would not be a David Lynch film, and it would not be Twin  Peaks.
If you make it through, it is the final scenes of Laura, our  delicate yet razored heroine, that will emotionally cripple the majority of  viewers. It is not light viewing. There is horror and anguish, and for me,  the final scene of Laura laughing and crying at her own life, the angel who  was unable to save her when she was alive, that she didn't even believe in,  this is what makes the movie.
The previous hour and a half, I'm not  convinced about. It is enjoyable, and it does answer some questions. The  bar scene and the traffic scene are both instant classics. But the sketchy  drawing of her life does not do justice to her death.
I'll stop there  'cos I'm getting far too deep. Look, this is a must see first movie. If you  don't like it, fine. It does not make you any less a person, it's just you  may be seeing different aspects to Lynch's psyche (something tells me the  entire thing pokes fun at TP fans anyway).
If you do like it, buy it,  treasure it, re-watch it again and again. Just don't try and explain why  you like it, because no-one will truly understand.",926467200,3,1605,4.29
681643,5,6303515304,"I must confess to having never watched the tv series. Forgive me, but I was in one of those rare social, spending a lot of time away from the television phases when Twin Peaks aired. That said, I loved Fire Walk With  Me.
Yes, I was confused. Yes, some of it made no sense; nevertheless, I  found it mesmerizing. I rented it again and again. The images, the music  (had to buy that soundtrack), the characters. I don't think I'll ever fully  understand some of the implications, but Fire Walk with Me will always  haunt me.
Sheryl Lee may have been cast as a dead body for the show, but  she carried this movie. The depths to which she plunged and the heights to  which she soared as Laura Palmer were incredible.
Most Twin Peaks fans  seem to think that this movie would scare off a non-Peaker, but I offer  that it may just enthrall a non-Peaker enough to send them searching for  the series on videotape, just as I am doing.

Here is the first mention of Judy, blue rose cases, Phillip Jeffries and the influence of electricity as an instrument of the dark forces in the lives of the characters.  Chris Isaak is excellent as FBI special agent Chester Desmond, referred to in The Return as one of the original agents dealing with (blue rose) inexplicable cases tied to ""Judy"".  Agent Cooper (Kyle Maclachlan)  and Gordon Cole (Lynch)  are seen as their pre-Laura Palmer selves, but the focus is on Laura in the lead-up to her murder and the possession of her father by the Bob entity.  The violence and debauchery are graphic and the storytelling coldly straightforward.
The bonus feature The Missing Pieces, elaborates on key scenes and answers some questions regarding Jeffries and Desmond.  This was a gift to the fans from Lynch after the series was canceled, however in the expanded universe that came with Twin Peaks: The Return, Fire Walk With Me has become the essential prequel for both the original television show and the breathtaking season three run.",1524441600,,1286,4.791855203619909

But 25 years later, the quirkiness and complexity made the original Twin Peaks episodes on ABC, the movie Fire Walk With Me, and the new 2017 series on Showtime fascinating to me. Fire Walk With Me, a prequel to the original series, plays a very important role in helping to explain the original series as well as the new one. To me, the franchise shifted from being ""strange"" and funny in the original episodes to being one of the best science fiction stories I've watched. (It helps that the characters developed over a 25-year period.) The writing is great, as are the actors and their portrayals.

7849934,2,6303515304,"This movie lost me. I just saw it for the first time in years and forgot how much of the film I'd...forgotten. Yes, this film really did little for me. There were cameos by main characters like Agent Cooper (Played Remarkably In TV series By Kyle McLaughlin) and then there were people like David Bowie (My First Time Seeing Him On Film Since His Tragic Passing). The real reason to see this film is Sheryl Lee. She was remarkable as Laura Palmer and she is the sole reason I will one day buy this on DVD.

This film is Two Stars--mainly because of Lee's fantastic portrayal of the lost and sexually abused girl Laura Palmer. She really reached down and gave the performance of performances. It's too bad that the film was so off kilter from start to finish. Not only that but there are actors and actresses that did not reprise their roles from the TV series which made the film hard to follow at times. Other times there were new characters introduced which made the storyline somewhat hard to follow. I liked the mlange of 1950's/late 1980's America. Of course cocaine was nowhere in middle America in the 1950's, but the tragic convergence of both timelines makes us wonder what if..

Two Stars. Roger Ebert once said that David Lynch was always trying to outsmart his viewers. I agree. I feel Lynch becomes too clever for his own good and this can at the very least confuse viewers and at worst anger them. Buy this DVD if you are a real Twin Peaks or David Lynch fan only. Otherwise you will be totally lost. I'm the 582nd person to review this film on Amazon.
