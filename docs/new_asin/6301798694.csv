367374,5,6301798694,"I miss the relative simplicity of the sixties, or at least the version of the sixties I remember from my childhood.

As always, Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as a long suffering poet and professor of poetry living on a houseboat with his wife and two children.  Glynis Johns does a wonderful job as Jimmy Stewart's long suffering wife.  Billy Mumy is his regular charming self.  Fabian, does a plausible job as the boyfriend of Stewart's daughter.

The plot in condensed version.  Absent-minded Stewart lives in the past, and lives for poetry, music and all things creative.  He teaches poetry in a nearby university, but hates technology, hates current events and thinks the entire world should think the way he does.  When he learns his son (Billy Mumy) is a mathematical genius, Stewart goes out of his way to suppress his son's math abilities (which he abores).  Unfortunately his son is color blind, tone def and has absolutely no creative gifts.

Billy Mumy (11 years old at the time he filmed this) loves Brigitte Bardot.  The bulk of the plot revolves around Mumy's efforts to meet his beloved.

Yes the humor is dated, the plot is thin and the characters are, well characters.  But it's still fun to watch.  James Brolin has an uncredited bit part (look closely), as does Brigitte Bardot (playing herself).  Actually there are dozens of uncredited character actors appearing in this movie if you care to look.  Ed Wynn, in one of his last film appearances, plays the captain (almost all he does is talk to the camera).

Dear Brigitte is based on John Haase's book  Erasmus With Freckles.",1379203200,7,1593,4.794117647058823

367376,2,6301798694,"A poet (James Stewart) is disturbed than his 10 year old son (Billy Mumy LOST IN SPACE) has no artistic or creative talent whatsoever. Instead, the kid turns out to be a mathematics prodigy! The precocious child is also obsessed with the French actress, Brigitte Bardot. This trifling excuse for a comedy is based on the novel ERASMUS WITH FRECKLES by John Haase and one would hope the book (I've not read it) offered more substance than this empty shell. I only laughed once during the film and I suppose I should be grateful even for that. The movie limps along without a clear destination and rather than end, simply expires. How does one critique a film like this when there's nothing concrete enough to discuss? Stewart is at his worst, his mannerisms intensified to the point of parody. But to be fair, the entire cast is adrift. Directed by Henry Koster (THE ROBE). The cast includes Glynis Johns, Ed Wynn (whose character has no function in the film except to talk to the audience), Fabian, John Williams, Jack Kruschen, Cindy Carol, Alice Pearce, Jesse White and as herself, Brigitte Bardot.

The Koch Media DVD from Germany is a very nice looking anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer with English and German soundtracks and English and German trailers for the film.

367377,5,6301798694,"At 43:42 when they ask Erasimus the division question, the key word is ""evenly"". Actually 17,590,038,552,578 divided by 680=25867703753.791176470588235294118 etc. However the questioner never said it had to be ""evenly"". As you know very few division questions have ""even"" answers. Furthermore the numbers Erasmus DOES say work evenly don't. For instance if you divide it by 2,147,483,647 you get 8191.00000000046566128 etc. This may be because computers back then couldn't calculate all those digits so ""relatively evenly"" was the best they could do. But he left out the one that is perfectly evenly: 2.
  Oh yeah, great film.  Of course the best scene was the one with Brigitte ;-)",1358035200,,682,5.296296296296297
367378,4,6301798694,"I don't understand why this movie is not on DVD. it can only be found on VHS, Blu-Ray, and Amazon Instant Video.
The movie itself is funny. Bill Mumy is one of the most underrated child actors of all times. The offscreen friendship the Mumy and the Stewarts had translates onscreen with the familiarity between James and Bill.",1347235200,3,326,4.637931034482759

367380,3,6301798694,"The film's main scheme has professor Stewart granting his mathematical-genius eight-year-old's fervent wish to meet Brigitte Bardot (then at the height of her sex appeal). The two go to Paris, and young Erasmus (Billy Mumy) is kissed by Bardot and given a puppy...

Prior to this, the boy's mathematical skills have been misappropriated by everyone, from his sister's boyfriend (Fabian), who needs he1p with homework, to a British con man (John Williams), who illegally wins gambling bets to alleged1y finance a humanitarian arts foundation... Fabian also comes up with another idea for Erasmus to pick racetrack horses...

Stewart is a poetic, whimsical college professor who wants the simple life with his wife on a rather primitive, decaying Mississippi riverboat home... Stewart's accordion skills are brought to life, even if briefly, as he insists that the entire family take up musical instruments... But the pre-teen son is tone deaf, and when he takes up painting he turns out to have no eye for color either... The retarded discovery that he is a math prodigy brings more trouble than satisfaction, as the perplexed Stewart sadly discovers...

Glynis Johns, who had been on the point of marrying Stewart in ""No Highway in the Sky"" back in 1951, was at last Stewart's wife in the film...

Bardot provided some diversion for the French press when she pronounced Stewart, then 57, ""a gentleman with ageless sex appeal, enormous charm.""",1233446400,4,1442,5.14957264957265
367381,5,6301798694,"Dear Brigitte is one of the funniest comedies from the 1960s, about a tone-deaf, color-blind boy genius with one interest:  Brigitte Bardot.  James Stewart plays professor Robert Leaf, a typical college professor (when speaking of college professors typical means liberal, but this was 40 years ago and labels change).  Leaf teaches poetry, lives in a houseboat in San Francisco, vocally opposes nuclear power and progress in general.  He has an original way to make the family stick together - family concerts.  His daughter calls him square.  Leaf's 8-year old son Erasmus is played by Billy Mumy (Sammy the Way Out Seal, Lost In Space, Bless The Beasts & Children, Three Wishes).  Leaf hopes to find artistic genius of some sort in his only son, and nurtures him in music, painting, literature, etc.  But Leaf is disappointed, to put it mildly, when it turns out Erasmus has a gift for math, can out-think the colleges newest computer, instantly compute horse-race winners.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but Erasmus had been writing to Bardot regularly, and after the family comes to depend on his ability,  his love-sickness causes a mental block. Glynis Johns (Father's Delicate Condition, The Cabinet of Caligari, Mary Poppins) plays Leaf's wife.  Ed Wynn (Requiem For A Heavyweight, Mary Poppins) is a neighbor / captain / narrator.  Other cast include Fabian, Cindy Carol, John Williams, Jesse White, Jack Kruschen, and James Brolin in an early bit part.  Brigitte Bardot appears at the end.",1121644800,8,1518,5.024
367382,4,6301798694,"Henry Koster's (Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation) Dear Brigitte (1965) is an absolutely charming family chronicle of an acclaimed poet Professor Robert Leaf's (James Stewart) personal, family, and professional difficulties once he learns that his youngest son has turned out to be a mathematical prodigy unbeknownst to him. Devastated by the realization that his son has developed talents in the dreaded sciences and failed miserably in his endeavors in playing the Tuba (he's tone deaf) and painting pictures (he's color blind), Professor Leaf attempts to halt all of the publicity of his son's newly discovered gifts, pointlessly seeks to find another of his son's gifts in the area he wants him to, and desperately tries to find a way to cope with son's new found celebrity. Ironically at the same time, Stewart's young son is secretly writing love letters to French actress Brigitte Bardot.
However irrelevant and inane this plot may sound to you, Dear Brigitte delivers with winning performances from John Williams, Glynis Johns, Cindy Carol, Cahrled Robinson, Jack Kruschen, and Bill Mummy, inspired mixtures of slapstick and situational humor, highly sophisticated banter, and nicely matured moral issues tightly packed into one mightily charming whopper of a family film.
Definitely not to be missed, even when you're thirty.",975974400,16,1327,5.354066985645933

Billy Mumy from Lost In Space is wonderful as the gifted kid in puppy-love with screen siren, Brigitte Bardot.  Fabian, Glynis Johns, Cindy Carol, and Ed Wynn round out the cast.

about it by watching a biography on Brigette Bardot. You
will have to have a zone free DVD player to watch it, and
you will have to select english on the menu every time
you watch it. But any movie with James Stewart is pretty
good, and Billy Mumy from Lost in Space is always fun
to watch in deffernt kid roles. It also has Ed Wynn and
Fabian. Brigitte Bardot does a short guest appearance
but the movie is mostly about James Stewart and Billy
Mumy, if you like the look and feel of movies from the
early 60s this is a pretty good little known show you
might want to add to your collection.",1426636800,2,651,4.054263565891473
367412,4,6301798694,A great fun filled romp for everyone.  Entertaining and the kind of light comedy that James Stewart handled so well.  Here he is a absent minded poetry professor who is afraid that the arts will disappear swallowed up by the advancing scientific community.  He wants all the members of his family to excel at something in the field of arts and is in a quandary when he finds his young son is a mathematical genius and the scientist all want him.  Add to the mixture his walking math star has been writing love letters to Brigitte Bardot the French movie star and she has now answered one of his letters.  With all the problems going on Glynis Johns is great as the level headed Mom that handles everything so calmly.  Well worth a watch.,1424044800,2,737,4.462686567164179

367441,4,6301798694,"I bought this German Koch Media Blu-ray for myself for my birthday in October and although I had problems accessing the trailers that were featured and wrote to the vendor who seemed to explain the problem at the time, but I let it go as all other features on the disc worked well.  I had just had problems with accessing an English-language track of a Region 2 disc and received a few dollars back if I kept the disc with the momentary interruption in the English track that resulted.  But now two Criterion blu-rays are giving me trouble accessing the subtitles from the discs and must access them from my remote which puzzles me further.  But I had to say, now just a few days after the New Year, the blu-ray of ""Dear Brigette"" (1964) is more than a one-joke, bubble-headed sixties suburbia confection that it is decided by a number of reviewers, but quite funny in an endearing way of such films from that era especially pertinent and deserving of such a beautiful and expensive blu-ray transfer. In light of today's morality and the simple-minded moral ethics in question in the film it is good to see it that we take it for granted today and look at as no-brainers the things that the film grapples with as questionable then.  James Stewart does seem to rely on past performances to where some of his mannerisms seem to be caricatures of himself.  But Billy Mumy, Cindy Carol, Fabian, Alice Pearce and the entire cast, and especially Glynnis Johns are very good.  If Brigette Bardot's appearance sparks the interest in this being a German edition only adds to the prestige as it is clearly a Hollywood guest appearance at best.  It was worth the extra money they charged for this import for the nostalgia factor built in anyway.  As Ed Wynn would make an aside about some reviewers if he were the voice-over narrator of our film, some reviewers wouldn't see the irony if they stumbled over it.  The 20th Century-Fox film is in beautiful Cinemascope and Color by Deluxe and is presented digitally remastered.  Directed by Henry Koster with photography by Lucien Ballard.  Will report further mechanical defects as they are explained.",1388793600,5,2138,4.720430107526882
