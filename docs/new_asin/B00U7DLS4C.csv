7029463,5,B00U7DLS4C,Loved it!  So refreshing!,1467244800,3,25,5.25
7029464,5,B00U7DLS4C,"This is the funniest program I've seen in a long time.  I laughed out loud at Germaine's pursuit of Lee--until she learns better, Della's love of big chainsaws, Grampy's (aka Inspector Japp from Poirot) smoking some good Moroccan, and Yoko becoming a woman.  Hilarious! [I watched this program on Amazon Video using my Acorn TV subscription.]",1467072000,8,342,5.089285714285714
7029465,5,B00U7DLS4C,"I'm middle aged, and not one for ""coming of age"" stories, but this was a bawdy blast. Sorta-kinda reminded me of the Danish show ""Rita"", mixed with a bit of ""The Wonder Years.""",1466985600,2,176,4.363636363636363

7029469,5,B00U7DLS4C,"""Wank away the pain!"" This immortal quote by oversexed, nightmarish teen Germaine (she's the chubby one with all the hair) beats the hell out of ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" in my book.  I'm notoriously hard to amuse, but this show blew me away with it's quick wit and originality.  Sure, we've seen white trash families played for sitcom larfs before, but this one is right up there with the best, mixing super smart dialogue with  unforgettable characters and a TON of musical and cultural references that will have you on the floor.  if episode one doesn't grab you, be sure to stick around because they only get better and better.",1480550400,,630,4.648648648648648
7029470,5,B00U7DLS4C,"It is such a great show, so sad it wasn't renewed for a third season. It seems a lot of great shows are the ones being canceled and then others keep going way past what they need to :(",1480291200,,184,3.7435897435897436
7029471,5,B00U7DLS4C,"I've spent a lot of time in the US and the UK.  I enjoy trying new Series so when I saw this I knew I had to try it.  Glad I did.  The weird White Trash pretense is deliciously sublime.  Is it crass? Yes.  Is it stupid?  Yes.  Is it funny?  YES!  Is it gross?  Meh.  Does it show the trials and tribulations of being a teenager?  Yes.  Does it show the White Trash Mum trying to wrangle her weird kids?  Yes.
Alcohol, stupidity, teenage-itis, old stoner Gramps, geekiness, boyfriends, being on the dole and everything you could think of in this kooky show.
I would recommend watching ALL of the 1st series before you judge this.  I hope this lasts at least 5 years.  I'd like to pick my favourite character but its simply too difficult. They are all brilliant actors.
Kudos to:
Rebekah Staton as Della Garry
Philip Jackson as Grampy
Helen Monks as Germaine Garry
Alexa Davies as Aretha Garry
Molly Risker as Yoko Garry",1477699200,3,918,4.375

8704579,5,B00U7DLS4C,"Very witty and well-written, as only the British can write comedies. Not sure everything will 'translate' for Americans, but if you like politically incorrect humor and the angst of teens growing up, this is for you. Philip Jackson (formerly Inspector Japp of Poirot fame) is brilliant as Grampy and shows just what a talented actor he really is.  Hilarious. I laughed til I cried in some spots. In fact, all credit to the cast for being able to keep a straight face filming this show.",1483056000,2,485,4.705882352941177
