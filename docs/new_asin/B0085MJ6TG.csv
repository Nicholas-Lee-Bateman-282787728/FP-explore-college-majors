8525656,2,B0085MJ6TG,Disappointed. One of the first things you see at the beginning is a dancer's pelvis in tiny shorts. This isn't ideal for my 8 year old. God calls for more modesty than that and girls should not be afraid of that.,1493337600,,212,4.195121951219512

It generated a great discussion which led to positive change.",1362441600,2,124,4.9523809523809526
8525658,1,B0085MJ6TG,"The acting is terrible, the filming is terrible, but I get that they mean well by making this movie. This was a big mistake, I borrowed it from redbox for 1.29$ and I wish I didn't! This movie is AWFUL. It was worse than Kristen Stewart's acting in the entire Twilight series. Please please please don't waste your time or money.",1360368000,,329,4.409836065573771
8525659,5,B0085MJ6TG,"I just finished watching Youth of Christ and it became crystal clear the effectiveness this movie will have for Christians who are struggling between two worlds.  I laughed, I cried, I became engaged with the main characters.  I could relate with several characters, particularly during my college days. I truly hope you watch the film and send it to all young adults out there.  It is time to step out of complacency and commit to honoring God and living a life that reflects that.",1333584000,3,482,4.714285714285714
8525660,5,B0085MJ6TG,"This is a great movie!! I highly recommend it to any Christian in need of a little encouragement while living in today's society.  It's hard to ""live in this world, but not be of this world"" and this movie definitely helps with that.",1327190400,4,233,4.4186046511627906
