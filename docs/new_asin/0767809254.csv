7170,1,0767809254,"I was going to get this to see it again for nostalgia. After reading the reviews it seems Amazon is having us pay for lesser quality viewing. After reading the reviews I also realized that many of the digital purchases we have made on Amazon are also horrible quality as we rate the quality when asked. Why does a money monster like Amazon have to stick it to its customers like this?  Because clearly, we are taking it lying down and we give Amazon loads of money for bootleg quality products. Maybe Jeff Bezos should get the same ""invitation"" Zuckerberg just got to answer some questions under oath.",1522195200,,601,4.564814814814815

7181,5,0767809254,"Younger ones, do not be afraid. This is a timeless movie with comedy, conversation and story that could happen today. The only difference is cell phones and tablets are replaced by ruffles and poofy hair. It's a story set in the south, in Louisiana, and centers around an odd group of Southern women in a small town who come together to celebrate and mourn life's most pivotal moments.

It's got funny laugh out loud moments, and it might make you cry too.  It's 2 hours long and cast with some legends, 1 of which you may recognize, Julia Roberts. Dylan McDermott plays her beau Jackson. The others you may not recognize, but they make today's stars look unreal when it comes to talent. I personally don't like Sally Fields, I find her outbursts annoying, but this movie gets 5 stars from me still and I can tolerate her quite well in it, it's that good.

7218,2,0767809254,"This review is NOT about the movie as it is five plus stars. It is about the blu ray from Twilight Time. I have the DVD and just received the blu ray. For some unknown reason Columbia Pictures never issued this as a blu ray, so Twilight Time did. Normally I have been pleased with Twilight Time releases (HINT: all their releases are far far cheaper on their website, as I just found) as well as Criterion Collection releases. Honestly, Criterion is the best of all of them...Criterion, Twilight, Shout! Factory and Scream! Factory.

This is FAR FAR from a blu ray. I still own the DVD release and will continue to do so. There is absolutely NO difference between the blu ray and the Columbia DVD both in video and audio. I mean NONE. In fact, the blu ray is darker in tone then is the DVD. The darker tone does not account for a richer deeper picture, it is just dark. The DVD has a much brighter picture and the color at times appears sharper.

Perhaps there is a reason why Columbia never issued this as a blu ray. If their reason was because the negative would not transfer well, I certainly understand--as it clearly does not.",1507161600,,1131,4.4066985645933014

And...they loved it. I teach classes where most of the students are free lunch and all but one of the rest are reduced, very few of them are white, many are foreign-born and many of those are refugees...and they all got the humor and love in a movie about a bunch of white southern women in the 80's.
A movie with that sort of reach is hard to find, but they all loved every scene I shared with them and some told me afterwards they'd watched it on their own afterwards.

7244,3,0767809254,"Review of ""Steel Magnolias""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

There are so many reasons to watch Steel Magnolias, and once youve watched it, you can cross it off your classics to watch list and move on to the next one.

Youll appreciate the large cast (Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Sally Field, Daryl Hannah, Tom Skerritt, Sam Shepard, Dylan McDermott) and youll get a kick out seeing Julia Roberts in the movie just before she donned knee high boots for Pretty Woman. And yes, youll laugh and shed a tear, but then youll survive. This isn't Terms of Endearment.

Steel Magnolias will appeal to the Fried Green Tomatoes, Crimes of the Heart, and August: Osage County. In other words, its a movie about a bunch of Southern women muddling through life, with a little tragedy, a few chuckles, and a sweet tea or two. If you like those types of movies, add this to your weekend watch list and start popping that corn!",1498435200,,930,4.624242424242424

7248,5,0767809254,"Being Southern born and bred, this movie is almost totally accurate.  The exception is the use of God's name in vain.  Never in my entire life have I heard any true Southern Lady use that particular swear word/phrase.  It's just not done.  Yes, the ladies get together without the men around and cut up and laugh and use what is considered unladylike language. However, as I said, no way would that one particular swearing be done. Even for those who didn't attend church, that was just such a disrespectful thing to say. I'm not being a hypocrite nor do I mean to come across as some pious holier than thou woman.  We all loved the movie.  It represents what women are.  We may look as weak as a flower, but we aren't really.  When dealing with the journey of life, we have a back bone of steel, an absolute iron will. The casting of such different personalities was wonderful. Grudges are forgotten in the sad or bad times. This is one of the best movies I've seen in my long life. Touche' Ladies.",1497139200,,999,4.420765027322404

7250,4,0767809254,"Although I've always enjoyed this show, even when I'm ""laughing through tears,"" I have one big complaint.  I don't find it funny when the characters repeatedly take Christ's name in vain, as though His name were a common curse word.  I know I sound like Annell, but she was right.  It's wrong, and it's insulting to everyone who holds Christ dear.  And telling people to shove their Bibles where the sound doesn't shine is equally as insulting.  People honestly don't realize what they're doing.  Be glad most Christians aren't violent about such things (as I am not violent, either)!",1496880000,2,584,4.848484848484849

7259,2,0767809254,"I've always loved this movie and finally decided to add it to my video library on Amazon. HOWEVER! The sound is terrible! It was difficult to hear dialogue during any part of the movie where music was playing. The music is too loud and fades the voices of the actors. This same thing happened on another movie I just rented prior to this one on the same night. I thought maybe it was the previous movie's issue, but it turns out that it may be an Amazon issue.

You'll look at everything foreground and background. The sheen and strands in Dolly's wig, the fibers in Dolly's sweater, the un blended frosting in Daryl's hair, the labels on the shampoo bottles in the salon, even the broken champagne glasses.

This is a movie you will be watching over & over again for years to come. Worth Buying!!! Julia Roberts is also amazing in it.

This movie was released in 1989 and made over 80 million dollars at the box office. It was an instant classic. & Remains in the hearts of millions of  fans around the world.

7461,4,0767809254,"This movie is the best proof that stage comedies do not transfer well to the screen.  The comedy lines that play well on stage sound forced and badly delivered in a movie and it's like they are trying to make the first part of the movie all comedy lines.  The badly done comedy scenes are spaced here and there throughout the movie.  I think it's just badly directed because some of the comedy lines are really funny but they sound so forced and artificial that you just cringe.  The drama scenes are for the most part very well done and well acted.  It's a good story with a lot of very good characters.  I found the forced southern accents badly done.  I'm from the south and I know what is natural and what isn't. But, all in all, it's an enjoyable movie.",1462665600,,758,4.295774647887324

7575,5,0767809254,"Steel Magnolias is one of my favorite movies. It manages to mix humor with sadness in the best possible way. Aside from that, I think it has a perfect cast. Sally Field as the lead, the mother who worries about her diabetic daughter, Julia Roberts as her diabetic daughter, Dolly Parton as the lovable town beautician, Shirley MacLaine as the town grouch, Olympia Dukakis as the fun-loving ex-first lady of the town, and Daryl Hannah as the new girl in town. I can't get over how well I think this cast does together. They do perfectly together at making their friendship seem believable, and long-lasting. Steel Magnolias is a very watchable movie even to this day, and offers more than a mere ''chick flick'' viewing. Along with Fried Green Tomatoes, Thelma & Louise, and Beaches I think this movie is undeniably classic!",1452902400,,823,4.802816901408451

The football players were shown nude (though only from the back), and by that time, we were also quite tired of hearing the word s**t, which peppers the dialogue very frequently.

Otherwise, probably a nice film, though we did not finish it.",1445299200,,407,4.814285714285714

7683,3,0767809254,"An A-list cast and sleek Hollywood production values can't overcome the fact this film adaptation sucks a good deal of the life and feeling out of the play on which it is based.  Attempts to ""open up"" the story by leaving the beauty parlor set which was the location of the play and adding male characters only dilute the material.  The most egregious mistake is showing the death of one of the characters, rather than allowing us to experience it though the originally powerful final monologue of another character.  This makes that monologue (significantly cut) anticlimactic.  A tacked-on feel good ""the cycle of life continues"" coda  only makes the petering out of energy more pronounced.  Performances range from good (Sally Field) to phoned in (Olympia Dukakis) to perfectly dreadful (Shirley McLaine).  A good example of how ""the industry"" can botch good material.",1436918400,2,871,5.091549295774648

The story highlights how the foursome support one another through life's ups and downs in a small southern town. Any woman who has lived in the South and truly understands southern culture will throughly  enjoy every  moment of the nuanced performances of Sally Field, Olivia Dukakis, Dolly Parton,  and Darryl Hannah. I had forgotten just how much of a treasure this movie is. Highly recommend.",1434585600,,716,4.5703125

7763,5,0767809254,"I'm a true film aficionado. I have a collection that numbers more than 5,000 in my collection going back to the silent film days, and I have served as a film reviewer in several publications, so I feel qualified to offer my insights about this wonderful ensemble film based on the Herbert Ross film production of the Robert Harling play.

One must first understand that Steel Magnolias was the first film director Herbert Ross did following the death of his first wife, Nora Kaye, in 1987. He said in an interview that Nora was an exceptionally strong woman just like the women in Harling's play and screenplay and he felt that he could pay her no better tribute than to make Steel Magnolias the best film of his long and illustrious career in her honor. When Ross passed away in 2001 we lost perhaps one of the greatest directors of his generation. Steel Magnolias was nominated for three Academy Awards (unfortunately, a split vote between Shirley MacLaine and Julia Roberts robbed both of them a Best Supporting Actress Award), two Golden Globes (of which Julia Roberts won one for Best Support Actress over Sally Fields), A Chicago Film Critic's Award nomination for Shirley MacLaine (which she did not win), A People's Choice Award for Steel Magnolias as Best Dramatic Motion Picture (which it did win), and finally a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Shirley MacLaine (which she did not win). A handy tally of success to say the least. Steel Magnolias was the 5th from last movie Herbert Ross would direct before he passed away of heart failure.

If you're an ""Easter-egg hunter"" (quite literally in this instance), look for the playwright, Robert Harling himself, playing the part of  the minister at the Easter festivities (both at the beginning and end of the film), the ""Ouiser never did a religious thing in her life,"" joke in the church, and at the funeral. I won't go into too much detail with spoilers.

Many people love to rehash Steel Magnolias for the script, this actress or that actress, but the truth is that Steel Magnolias was one of those films that was just plain spontaneous combustion. It was the right screenplay, with the right director, one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled (that includes Tom Skerritt and Sam Shepard--who's a damned good playwright in his own right in addition to being a world class actor--put he and Dolly Parton together and it's pure magic!) and the enticing cinematography of the beautiful area surrounding the true backdrop of Robert Harling's original story, Natchitoches, Louisiana. About 6 years ago I was driving through the area and stopped to see if Natchitoches was as beautiful as it was in the movie and I can tell you it isn't. It's even more gorgeous than you see in the film! It's warm and caring community of people who were just as changed by Robert Harling's play and screenplay as some of you were! I strongly suggest you drop by, kick your feet up and stay awhile!

The one scene I will center on without too much spoiler alerts (turn your head! Turn your head!) is the funeral sequence. I've been known to write a story or two in my days and every time I see Steel Magnolias, the funeral sequence always impacts me emotionally, and I wish I could write half as well as this scene plays out.

Even though I know exactly what's going to happen (who am I fooling? I have the script memorized and mouth the words without making a sound!), I have NEVER had a movie, play or event in my life that takes me from one emotion and slams gears into the reverse direction so abruptly that you have NO choice but to react to both emotions you're feeling at the same time! In this case you can credit Sally Fields, Daryl Hannah (who does a sort of dorky blonde Jesus freak), and Olympia Dukakis grabbing the gear-shift on everyone's emotion by using Shirley MacLaine's grumpy Ouiser  character. If you've never seen it then I suggest you get your popcorn or snack ahead of time and take the phone off the hook. You really don't want anything to interrupt the dramatic rhythm of this sequence.

If you want to know what my biggest problem with this movie; it's the ending. Everything about my writing skills says it was a beautiful ending, but emotionally, I have this feeling deep inside my heart that I wish I could find out what happens to everyone.",1434240000,,4332,4.6684141546526865

7769,5,0767809254,"Loved this movie when it came out in '89 and still love it today.
The opening is of wedding day preperations and a new hair stylist who comes to town to work at Truvy's Beauty Spot, where the main characters congregate and gossip.
The main characters are a close knit group of friends: Sally Field--Dolly Parton--Shirley MacLaine--Daryl Hannah--Olympia Dukakis and Julia Roberts who live in a small town in Louisiana sharing their joys and struggles of life. This movie will make you laugh and cry and remind you that ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger"".
Lots of funny one liners, ""He doesn't know whether to scratch his watch or wind his butt"" through-out.
The friendship between Ouiser (pronounced Weezer) played by Shirley MacLaine and Clairee, played by Olympia Dukakis, is a hilarious love/hate relationship which at times had me cracking up especially in the funeral scene where Clairee tells M'Lynn, played by Sally Field, to take a whack at Ouiser.
The characters of the men in this movie seem somewhat weak and it's the women who hold everything together through all the ups and downs.
That's all I'm giving away in case you haven't seen this yet. I think you'll really like it and highly recommend.",1433808000,,1220,4.842105263157895

Us ladies should always band together in support each other like these ladies did instead of bitching about one another. I still cannot fathom Sally Field with a sourthern accent but she does make her role believable. There is a surprise ending although it is very sad in its own way. Olympia Dukakis is exceptional in that she tries to make others laugh in a sad situation. Either way, the plot indicates that us females can and will support each other in times of every tough crisis possible. The actual author who made the play that this movie is based on also has a sad story in that the play and this movie was based on his sister's illness and ultimate death. He does appear in this movie as the pastor in the beginning of the movie when Shelby is married to Jackson; and again serves as the pastor at the cemetery.

Most of the jokes were simply not funny, and at least a third of the film should have been edited out. Instead the scenes went on and on and on....I guess our tastes  and sensibilities change, and apparently, I'd say for the better. It's not that the movie was terrible; it still had some nice features, and a few of the actors were convincing or entertaining. Shirley MacLaine and Olympia Dukakis, for example, were hilarious foils for each other. Sally Field was mostly really good, despite a questionable script. Scrap the rest, especially the contrived Louisiana ambience and fake accents. Not authentic, not colorful. Don't bother.

I included a copy of an article in Oct 2014 Southern Living magazine of ""10 things I learned from Steel Magnolias""  Among the 10 are 1. Pain does not discriminate, everyone suffers; try not to do it alone. 2.  Life is a joking matter, the more serious the situation,the more critical it is that we laugh.",1426377600,,485,4.415730337078652

I'm very much alone in my aging years, my friends dead or scattered and my family is gone.  I may never see anyone again and my movies are my family.  With all my heart, I wish I had friends just like these women had with each other, at least during the making of this heartfelt film.  It's with great pleasure to see those great stars from glitter world honor their parts so well.  The movie was very good, it touches the center of your heart, the basic human/spirit you will experience at moments when at least a tear or more will fall.  It's the laughter you'll share with these talented women that will make you laugh out loud.  It's like being there with them.  Everyone of them shines in their part.  Shirley, Olympus, Sally, Dolly, Julia and Daryl were doing the performance to perfection.  I won't tell you about the movie because other's already have but, I know you won't want to just see it once.  It's a must have movie.",1425945600,,1081,4.275862068965517

In 89 which seems like yesterday to me, not as much was said publicly about Diabetes or death and this movie covers some of that but also has humor.  I was speaking of this at lunch yesterday and one of the ladies commented that she had seen the newer version made in about 2012 with all Black Actress and had really enjoyed it also.

8512,3,0767809254,"A bunch of women in Louisiana interact as one of their daughters is getting married. They continue to interact after the daughter dies. It is supposed to be one of those ""southern themed"" shows of the late 80s/90s that was pretty persistent in American culture then for whatever reason. Anyway, it was almost as if this movie tried to make being southern ""hip""/""cool"". They were portrayed as foul, immoral, eccentric air heads. Dunno. Maybe there was still some of the typical US socio-economic put down in there. Who knows? Anyway, the movie is over the top with this drama and sensationalism. I mean I have known people with diabetes before. Some who died from it as they had a horrific life with it--uncontrollable. But I have never seen any take a fit smacking at their new hair do like the Roberts character did. Just goofy. Kinda laugh out loud. Anyway, the one ""Christian"" in the movie was of course just an ""embarrassment annoyance"" designed to frame such people as such. We of course get to see Sally Field cry AGAIN. We get to see the tear jerking moment of when a husband signs away his wife's life by consenting to have her ""unplugged""--we humans sure do have such hard choices in life don't we--at least according to liberals.",1423612800,,1239,4.6880733944954125

Its portrayal of southerners is ludicrous, making them seem slow-witted and barbaric - an inaccurate picture at best.  Men are also characterized as dopey and non essential.  Being set in the Bible Belt, this movie makes a mockery of all things Biblical at every turn.  The lone character seemingly seeking God is portrayed as an idiot who can't figure out which end is up and who never can quite fit in with her ""superiors.""  ""Steel Magnolias"" is a sad depiction of what the South could become if overtaken by humanism.",1395619200,4,615,4.932038834951456

The chemistry is strong and the plot is as sweet as apple pie.  The one liners are a hoot and I still wonder who had to clean up the trunk of that car when 500 Easter eggs were crushed!

8814,5,0767809254,"This film has an absolute star-studded cast, though not all of the actresses may have been well-known (the younger ones) at the time that it was filmed.  The story of friendship and camaraderie between a group of women, and the tragedy that occurs in the film are heart-warming and breaking all at the same time.  It was particularly poignant for me because the tragedy involves a character with an unusual name which also happens to be the same name as a very close relative of mine.  I don't want to give too much away and spoil it for new viewers, but the story is heartrending and it brings out all the best (and the worst) in the characters.  I highly recommend this film, but it's not for the soft-hearted or those who are unwilling to cry and let themselves be vulnerable to the circumstances of the story line.  Directed by Herbert Ross, it's a masterpiece of human emotion and conflict.",1392595200,,895,4.56875

Each actress strongly embraces their character bringing out their best performance in one of the greatest ensemble of movie actresses.

And some of these characters are just amazing. The characters are funny, crusty, fanatical, and even a martyr type. This story hits a lot of highs and lows of ""real life"" situations.

9086,4,0767809254,"This was a re-visit # 3 for me viewing 'Steel Magnolias', where women were women and men were not as good. Louisiana in the 1980's, the good old days  when young women died from the complications of diabetes and kidney disease.

Dolly Parton owns the local beauty shoppe, where anyone and everyone in the know has their hair done, and all the troubles of the town are taken into account. The young bride-to-be , Selby, played by Julia Roberts, comes here with her mother, Sally Field, to have their hair done. The new hairdresser,played by Daryl Hannah,plies her trade and wins them over. The rich and mean woman of the town, played by Shirley MacLaine, comes to visit and leave her pearls of wisdom. Olympia Dukakis, whose character has lost her husband, has the real wisdom in they town.

These six Southern women are the steel magnolias of the town. Beautiful on the outside, most of them, with steel spines on the inside. But, then, aren't most women like that?

The film is characterized as a woman's chick flick, but that is wrong. This is a film for everyone, and gives us a chance to cry a little. This is a film for entertainment,to sweep us away from our troubles and to concentrate on the troubles of others.

9088,3,0767809254,"I watched this movie again last night after not having seen it for about 25 years.  I had almost completely forgotten the plot, except for the ending.

I did not grow up here, but I have lived in the deep south all of my adult life, and as usual the actors in this film have the stereotypical phony Southern ""accents"" -- even Dolly Parton has been too long in Tinseltown.  And even here the accents change somewhat (NC being different from GA, which is again different from an LA parish).  I understand that the rest of America cannot hear it, but native southerners pick right up on the forced sound of the actors.

The other thing that bothered me this go-round was the obvious change of seasons in the story (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, and back to Easter over several years) -- all while the native foliage is in the full bloom of summer.  We do have the four distinct seasons here, and our deciduous trees all turn colors and are then bare by late Fall every year.  However, I don't remember one outdoor scene where the trees were anything but fully green.  It gives the impression to the viewer that the entire movie was shot start-to-finish in about eight weeks.  The IMdB website of this film lists at least 34 shots where there was some flub or mis-continuity, but never mentions the obvious lack of outdoor seasons.

Other than that, a sad and funny film, with a wonderful title theme from Georges Delerue.",1372723200,,1418,4.569169960474309

""Just rat it up and make it look like a football"". I was at a wedding shower recently and the bridesmaid jokingly made that remark when the mother of the bride mentioned that she didn't know what she was going to do with her hair for the wedding. Another young woman sitting next to them asked, ""Isn't that from the movie ""Steel Magnolias""? They all started laughing with several of the other young women exclaiming, ""I love that movie"", and ""It's one of my favorites"", and ""One of the best movies ever made"". That pretty much sums up ""Steel Magnolias"". For many women it has managed to cross over from generation to generation, binding them together. Before there was the raucous comedy ""Bridesmaids"" there was the genteel movie ""Steel Magnolias"" that--even without all the comedic crudeness--managed to do it better.",1340841600,,1030,5.0588235294117645

I can't believe that I have not praised ""Magnolias"" here before now. I see that many reviews have covered the territory well, but I feel that not enough has been said about Sally Fields. She has many fine performances to her credit, but her contribution in this film is outstanding, even among those of other cast members.

Also, the direction is masterful: for instance, watch the transition between the funeral scene and the Easter scene; an incredible combining of dialogue, lighting, and music that is absolutely transformational. If you have not seen Steel Magnolias, by all means, do so. Then watch it again. And again....

9252,4,0767809254,"A group of small town southern women provide valuable insights into the strength of women in traditional settings. It sounds corny and hopelessly mundane, but somehow they make it work. Having a fabulous cast can't hurt.

Sally Field plays M'Lynn Eatenton, whose daughter Shelby (Julia Roberts) is getting married as the movie opens. Their friend and hairdresser Truvy Jones is played by Dolly Parton. Doesn't Dolly seem like the perfect small town hairdresser? Shirley MacLaine is the funniest character as Ouiser Boudreaux, the dog owner in permanent war with M'Lynn's husband Drum (Tom Skerritt). Ouiser has the best line in the film: ""I'm not crazy, I've just been in a very bad mood for forty years.""

Daryl Hannah somehow manages to look positively dowdy as Annelle, Truvy's new assistant who starts out like a whipped puppy, then goes pretty wild after her worthless boyfriend is sent to state prison for a long term. Finally, she gets religion and prays all the time. Still, she marries and has a baby at the end of the film. Or just after: the ending is rushing her off to the hospital because her water broke during a picnic.

Along the way we have all the drama and all the humor that these good people can work up just working out their lives. Seems like it ought to be boring, but it's not.",1336780800,,1303,4.706140350877193

9264,5,0767809254,"In this ultimate ""chick flick"" celebrating the strength of female friendships, a fine cast recreates the world in which playwright Robert Harling grew up. Despite the implication of women being as fragile as magnolias, their steely strength pulls them together, and they blossom with hope in the midst of tragedy.
 In this film adaptation of Harling's 1987 play based on the loss of his sister, the main area of the congregations of the principles is the home-based beauty salon run by Truvy Jones(played by the always sunny, lively, and amiable Dolly Parton)in a parish of Natchitoches, Louisiana.
 The story begins on the wedding day of Shelby Eatenton(Georgia Native, Julia Roberts, right in her element playing a Southerner) and Jackson Latcherie(Dylan McDermott). M'Lynn Eatenton (Sally Field) is hustling about readying herself and everyone for the occasion while her husband Drum(Tom Skerritt)and their two sons Tommy and Jonathan(Knowl Johnson and Jonathan Ward)are lighting firecrackers to clear the trees of birds that might literally mess up Shelby's wedding reception. There is their customary strife with the town grande dame Louisa""Ouiser"" Boudreaux(Shirley MacLaine) before M'Lynn and Shelby arrive to have their hair done at Truvy's.
  Truvy's newly hired assistant, Annelle Dupuy(an initially and uncharacteristically mousy-looking Daryl Hannah) arrives amid a personal crisis. Shelby generously invites her to the wedding, but in a bit of forshadowing,suffers an attack of hypoglycemia in the salon chair due to the stress and excitement of her big day. Family friend Clariee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis)lends a hand during the attack. After the episode passes, the wedding day is beautiful,and we are even treated to dancing with a little regional flair, and the view of the armadillo-shaped groom's cake made by the groom's aunt Fern (Ann Wedgeworth), although M'Lynn expresses concern about the diabetic Shelby's desire to have a child, and the concerned expression on her face is highly visible as the couple leave for their honeymoon.
 Over time, we see the evolution of the characters as the widowed Clairee, who has remained cheerful despite the loss of a husband and son in two different wars, comes into her own, encouraged by Shelby, buying a local radio station and working as a sports reporter; Annelle becomes a bit more stylish, and after a period as a wild woman, settles down with Sammy DeSoto(Kevin J. O'Connor), whom she met at Shelby's wedding, and becomes a Sunday School teacher in addition to working for Truvy. Shelby also inspires the cantankerous Ouiser to re-acquaint herself with one Owen Jenkin (Bill McCutcheon). Later, Truvy's husband Spud(Sam Shepard) will have a generous surprise for her.
 Holidays seem to mark times of relevant events for the characters. Shelby's pregancy is announced at Christmastime, and the apprehensive M'Lynn, still worried about the effect pregnancy will have on Shelby's health, is comforted by the others as they try to remain hopeful.
 The baby is born on Independance Day, and we meet Jackson Jr. as he celebrates his first birthday surrounded by his family.
 M'Lynn and Shelby, who now lives in another town, keep another appointment at Truvy's as they make the announcement that M'Lynn will donate a kidney to her daughter, amid gossip about what local beauty queen Nancy-Beth Marmillion(Janine Turner), prominently on display during the Christmastime festivities, was up to with a local politician afterwards.
 But on Halloween, Shelby collapses into a coma due to kidney failure as her helpless toddler, clad in a Halloween costume cries for his mother. Jackson finds her when he comes home.
 M'Lynn rushes to the hospital. But there is no hope. After the life support machine is turned off, she rushes home, leaving her husband, sons, and son-in-law in the waiting room, making a mournful solo trek across the bayou to collect her grandson from Aunt Fern.--A journey towards her own personal consolation.
 M'Lynn acknowledges that the women are handling this crisis better than the men were. The religious Annelle tries to make sense of the tragedy, stating that in death, Shelby is in a better place, and better able to take care of those she loved.
 M'Lynn only partially accepts this, but rages in pain, wondering how her grandson will ever know how wonderful his mother was or what she went through for him. But as time goes on, it is apparent that he will know through his loving grandmother and her friends, who will guard and support Shelby's most precious legacy.
 We depart from this amiable region of Natchitoches on a sunny and rather symbolic Easter Sunday as the pregnant Annelle leaves for the hospital to deliver another Shelby into the world. As life renews itself on that day, of all days, we can sense that a kind young woman is beaming down light on all those who loved her and we can somehow feel satisfied with that.",1315958400,,4920,5.150375939849624

9274,1,0767809254,"This poorly made, boring flick is nothing if not profoundly patriarchal. The main story line revolves around a young woman who is willing to risk her life and die in order to produce a baby. Because the central goal of a woman's life is to make babies. Unless you can fulfill this goal, you are incomplete. So of course, the only reasonable thing to do is for a woman literally to kill herself in an attempt to produce a baby.

There are many other female characters who are mainly dedicated to endless hen-like clucking around the protagonist's attempts to have a baby, as well as interminable conversations about hair-styles, weddings, husbands, etc. In Steel Magnolias, we see women of all generations inhabiting a world of their own. It's a world of babies, beauty, and homemaking. It's a world of things that the patriarchal societies always mark as exclusively female. Men are supposed to be detached from these ""womanly"" interests and concerns, while women have no interest in the pursuits of men. The view of genders as profoundly divided by an unbridgeable chasm of difference is patriarchal.

Why this film has been hailed as a feminist classic and has become a perennial staple of ""Feminist Film"" courses is beyond me.",1279152000,12,1229,4.875598086124402

Thus it was that my wife and I were browsing the low price DVD rack and happened to stumble upon it. Always enjoying a good late-night movie, we picked it up and watched it last night. It was excellent.

""Steel Magnolias"" is built around the lives and friendships of six women in the Bayou country of Louisiana. It's a beautiful setting and the filming is excellent. The story unfolds at a glacial pace and you gradually feel that you are a part of the women's lives. Then a slowly developing crisis overtakes two of the women and, of course, involves everyone else deeply. Be sure you have a handkerchief or two within east reach as it becomes a very sad movie. And then resolution and life goes on. Parts of the movie are light and funny, but then the story draws you into deep sorrow. My wife thought it was very depressing. Me, I rolled with it with only the loss of a few tears now and then. In any case, the acting was excellent and was rewarded with a number of Academy Award nominations. It's a very well-worth-watching movie.

9281,5,0767809254,"This movie is an all time favorite of mine and I have seen it a countless number of times.  The movie was actually filmed in Natchitoches, Louisiana, which is very close to where I live so I have visited the town, which is truly beautiful. I just want to state that I am some what bothered by some of the comments in other reviews stating that they wish the movie was more of this or more of that. This screenplay was written by Robert Harling about the life and horrible death of his sister Susan, who Julia Roberts character mirrors. This is a TRUE STORY based on Susan's REAL life & REAL death (in 1985) after the birth of her young son Jack Jr. The movie is what it is because Robert wrote it after locking himself in his room for 10 days after Susan's devastating death. Please feel free to research and you will find the truth, which is that this is not just some made up story but instead a story of the journey traveled by a real family from Natchitoches, La. That is also why the movie was filmed entirely in that lovely town. Robert Harling plays the preacher throughout the film, who marries Shelby & Jackson, who is at the cemetary & the Easter egg hunt on the river. He & his Mother were on site throughout ALL of the filming to make certain that it stayed true to the truth of their real life story. True fans should buy the ""Steel Magnolias Scrapbook - Memories of Movie making in a small town"" if you love the movie.

9288,5,0767809254,"""Steel Magnolias"" made Julia Roberts a movie star, and proved that Dolly Parton was as good an actress as Sally Field and Shirley MacLaine. The film is about a group of best friends in Louisanna who come together when one of them loses their daughter. A splendid film, ""Steel Magnolias"" will make you laugh and cry. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone says, ""The ladies are live wires. Just stand back and watch them set off sparks"".
 While filming Christmas scenes in 100 degree weather in the summer of 1988, Dolly was sitting on the sidelines quietly waiting for her call from the director. Totally made up in heavy sweater and a wig, Dolly was approached by Julia Roberts who, with the exception of Dolly, was complaining about the heat. She said to Dolly, ""how can you just sit there and not complain about the heat?"", to which Dolly stated, ""when I was a little girl I wanted to be two things, rich and famous, and now that I'm both of those things I'm not gonna complain"". Julia was speechless! Another good quote from Dolly too was when the director, Herbert Ross, told her she couldn't act. Dolly exclaimed, ""Shoot I know I can't act. You didn't hire me so I could act. You hired me because I'm a personality. I'm Dolly Parton. So if your any kind of director you'll make it look like I'm acting!"".

9291,3,0767809254,"I'll never understand the male stereotype that says you cannot admit to liking anything that doesn't involve bloodshed, sports or nudity.  Sure, as a guy I can understand why those three things are appealing to my gender (although I am far from a sports fan) but I have never been one to hide my deeper feelings or emotions.  I cry whenever I want to; I have deep and meaningful conversations with my male friends and I definitely watch whatever it is that I want to regardless of the intended fan base.

I say this, not because I think that this is a particularly good movie but because this seems to be a popular movie that men feel unabashedly ashamed in either watching or enjoying or, god forbid, crying at.

The film tells the story of a group of women who frequent the same hair salon and become a central part of each others lives over the years.  There is M'Lynn, the kind hearted mother who only wants what is best for her daughter Shelby, who just so happens to be a serious diabetic.  There is Truvy, who owns the salon, and Annelle, her new employee with a background no one is too sure about.  There is the loudmouthed Ouiser and her loyal friend Clairee.

Together they make for one lively bunch.

The film mostly focuses on M'Lynn and Shelby as they struggle to come to terms with Shelby's growing independence.  Shelby wants to get married and have children, but the doctors have warned her that childbirth will not be a smart move for someone in her condition.  M'Lynn wants to allow her daughter to live her own life, but she also is the mother and mothers always know what is best for their children; right?

The film is tragically clich&eacute;d, which probably adds to the memorable factor, since we've seen it all before, but it takes away from the originality and my personal overall appreciation of the film.  It's also very heavy handed, and it's not always smooth about it either.  The acting is a bit spotty, sometimes so over the top it's annoying and other times so grounded in itself that it is stunningly superb.

Let's look at the two opposite ends of the spectrum; Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field.  Two of my favorite actresses of all time spar off and only one is the victor; Field.  Sally Field delivers what may be her finest performance ever, delving deep into the maternal spectrum of this woman's very being.  M'Lynn aches to see her daughter live a full life, but she cannot look past the fact that a full life may very well kill her.  It's heartbreaking to say the least.  Shirley MacLaine, who may even be a better actress as a whole, is ridiculously overacting throughout this film.  Her mannerisms are all over the place and her characters comedic timing borders on annoying.  It's shameful, which is sad, because I love her.

Olympia Dukakis is stunning here, Dolly Parton is fun and Daryl Hannah is effectively nave, even if neither do a whole lot to be remembered for.  Julia Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for her performance, and was the favorite to win (although she lost) but her performance is decent at best, never really investing itself as deeply as Field's.  She does a fine job, but nothing spectacular.

So, did this movie make me cry?  Yes, it did, and I am not ashamed to say that.  The ending is such a heartbreaker, and Field is so convincing in her tragic portrayal that anyone who doesn't cry is made of stone, really.  Is the movie really as amazing as many make it out to be?  No, not really.  It works to an extent and sports a beautiful performance but its own clich&eacute;s and spotty collective ensemble tear it down a few notches and keep it from being the classic many want it to be.  See it for Field, for she is heaven-sent, but don't expect too much from the film as a whole.",1231200000,,3757,4.52

9297,5,0767809254,"At the moment I can think of no other film featuring four academy award winning actresses, and Darryl Hannah and Dolly Parton hold up well in this ensemble featuring Oscar-winners Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Olympia Dukakis and Shirley Maclaine.

Steel Magnolias is an artifice - a fictional Southern Universe where all the women are strong and funny and compassionate and lovable despite their flaws.  It's the kind of fictional universe where the characters are named M'Lynn, Truvy, Ouiser (pronounced ""Wheezer""), Annelle, Clairee and Shelby.  In my extensive travels in the south I have met one Shelby, and no real people with these other names.  I also have not met a Drum, Spud or Jackson. But the writing, which is funny from the opening wedding to the final funeral, is crisp and delivered with relish by the above-mentioned crew.

Now, part of the artifice in the film is that men are little more than accessories to the lives of our starring six women.  The script, by Robert Harling from his script, gives us only a spattering of men who are all a good bit dumber, less caring, less compassionate and more boring than the women.  Tom Skerrit, Sam Shepard and Dylan McDermot play the husbands of Field, Parton and Roberts respectively, but the screenplay makes them all disposable.

At the center of the story are Sally Field's M'Lynn, who is mother to Julia Roberts' Shelby, who is marrying Jackson.  Everyone gets their hair done at Truvy's (played by Dolly), but the chief currency at the beauty parlor is gossip, traded with most enthusiasm by widowed Clairee (played by Dukakis) and with most bark and a little bite by Ouiser (Maclaine).  As the film opens Darryl Hannah's Annelle has blown into town not sure if she's married or not (good fodder for the gossipers) and ready to put her fledgeling beauty technician skills to work at Truvy's, just before Shelby's wedding.

The spark in the film comes from the interactions of these female characters who have known each other in this small town all their lives.  They know about Shelby's diabetes and about Ouiser's wang-dang and flapdoodle, and interest is generated seeing these characters knowingly dance around one another.

There are no crimes - of the heart or otherwise.  No murders.  No secret affairs.  The Lord's name is taken in vain a few times, but Annelle lets `em know she don't appreciate it.

This world is fictional, but so are Never-Never Land, Middle Earth and most other worlds we visit in film, so as a native southerner I'm able to reconcile things like accents: Dolly is pretty stuck playing women with an East Tennessee twang, and to be honest I found Julia's accent no better than Olympia's.  You'd think for two Oscar-winning actresses that the one from Georgia would have a better Louisiana drawl than the one from Massachusetts, but there ya' go.

The Mrs. Tells me I too often am critical of films that stretch my suspension of disbelief.  This one stretched me, but only a little, and I liked the movie overall.  The Mrs. Loves it.",1222819200,2,3027,4.827519379844961

9301,4,0767809254,"This could be the ""chick flick"" to end all chick flicks, but the wonderful cast of ladies raises this other wise superficial and brisk moving story to a higher level. The film follows the lives of six women for about a four year period. We don't really see as many layers as the film makers would like us to believe, it is essentially a bunch of hens flapping their wings and doing ""girl things"". This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because these girls are captivating and they can act even if a lot of this seems a bit stagey! There are also several powerful scenes in this film.

The men in this movie are mere pawns and are there only to move the film along to it's predicable and manipulative ending.

I also liked the emphasis on friendship and how very important friendship is to surviving with the harshest trials of life.  The importance of friendship is essentially the underlying theme of the movie. Just as ""Gone With the Wind"" shows how Scarlett O'Hara could survive any obstacle that comes her way, this movie shows how to handle the hardest life situation...death. Although the mood of the movie becomes somber, the ending really gives the viewer a real ""feel good"" feeling.

The real tragedy was the fallout as a result of a selfish decision to go againt common sense and medical advice and have a baby.

So, at the end of the film, despite all the pretty flowers and softly filmed sunshine in the park we've got the following: a young man who is now a widower, a family devistated by their unnecessary loss (despite BEGGING her not to get pregnant), and a child who has no mommy.

Remember, this was all the result of her choices.  Chillingly, this is a real life story.

9318,5,0767809254,"Steel Magnolias is a movie about family, love, and relationships. The plot revolves around a beauty parlor where the main characters go to become beautiful. The character of the beauty parlor owner is played by Dolly Parton.

At Truvy's Beauty Parlor in Louisiana we learn all about these close group of friends and soon learn the secrets these women carry in their hearts.

M'Lynn, played by Sally Fields is married to Drum Eatenton, a playful man who at the start of the film is busy shooting birds that are perched on a tree on his property. This drives us all crazy, especially those of us that firmly believe on the protection of the environment... but they have a very special reason as a motive.

Daughter of Drum and M'Lynn Eatenton, Shelby, superbly played by Julia Roberts is getting married and we soon see these women go to visit the beauty parlor in preparation for the big day. Annelle Dupuy Desoto, played by Daryl Hannah, has just joined the staff as a hair dresser, ""a glamour technician,"" and soon the women are hard at finding all about ""her past"" because even though she is ""the sweetest thing"" just live through puberty and you must have a past.

Ouiser Boudreaux, a bitter, ill tempered and outspoken lady, played deserving of an award by Shirley MacLaine joins the women and she puts Annelle through a rather fun and entertainment interview.

Clairee, a recently widowed woman, played by Olympia Dukakis is the only person that truly understand Ouiser... and the give and take of these women is so endearing and captivating, that we soon find ourselves enchanted by this movie.

9326,2,0767809254,"In 2005, we took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the ""cutest"" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough ""cute"" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in ""Hitch"". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One ""Hillbillies-like"" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some ""crows"" out of a tree so that they won't ""**** all over the reception"". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.

Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.

Dolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.

The movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).

Overall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene.",1162512000,4,2635,4.759299781181619

She gets married and contrary to Julia Robert's character's mother's wishes (played by Sally Field) she instructs Julia Robert's character, ""Shelby"" not to have a baby, but because Julia Robert's character is young, married and really wants a family goes against her mother's wishes.

Performances: 5/5 (I'm still shocked nobody won an Oscar)
Standout Scene: The entire funeral sequence.

9344,5,0767809254,"I think this will probably go on some list one day as one of the greatest movies of the 20th century.  Not only was the cast diverse and perfectly chosen, they really brought out the truth of the movie.  This movie really made people realize that no one has a perfect life, and that even when mirales happen, so do tragedies.  Julia Roberts (Shelby) and Sall Field (M'Lynn) really entertained audiences with their dramatic, yet sometimes comedic, relationship as mother and daughter.

The town that this movie was filmed in is actually when I attend college right now--Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana.  The town itself is almost exactly like it is protrayed in the movie:  there really is an annual Christmas festival that is just as wild as it was in the movie, people really are friendly, and that cemetary where ""Shelby"" is buried at really does exist and is really creepy!

It's also exciting life like Shelby's really did exist.  ""Shelby""--although not her real name, in real life was a member of the Phi Mu Fraternity at NSU, and her little boy ""Jack"" is actually in one of my classes!

It's really neat knowing that such a classic movie was made right here in the town in which I am studying.

So, despite the horrible southern accents (the actresses were taught to speak like they were from Georgia and not Louisiana!), this movie is a great family movie and will cause your heart to drop and your eyes to tear.  Five stars!",1107043200,5,1457,4.696850393700787

9347,5,0767809254,"The person who reviewed the movie giving it 2 or 3 stars and claiming not to believe the story is true can be assured that indeed, the story of Shelby in Steel Magnolias in true. Shelby is based upon the story of Robert Harling's sister Susan Harling Robinson and was written in remberance of her for her son who was 2 years old at the time of her death in 1986 due to complication of diabetes and a kidney transplant (from her mother) which ultimately failed.
She and her brother Robert attended the exact same university that I now attend: Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana. She was a member of Phi Mu Kappa Iota Sorority (The second oldest in the nation) and WAS indeed a nurse. For whatever sad reason, Susan decides to have a child (""I would rather have 30 minutes of wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special.""... one of her famous last words) even though doctor's warn her against this and she ultimately loses her life. The sad facts of life is that her son Robert will never know his mother. The movie is definitely worth watching and I say this not because of the ""famous cast,"" but because it shows that, hey, life is short and sometimes we make choices that cost us dearly. Susan died a very young woman and left behind a husband, son, mother and family forever bereft of her presence. Her brother said (of the script) that he wrote it in 10 days not long after her death because he was angry that she was dead. He later wanted it so that his nephew would remember his mother.
Wynona Ryder was originally offered the role of Shelby/Susan, but was considered too young. Julia Robert's was a wonderful choice and definitely not someone I would consider ""horsey faced."" If she is ""horsey faced,"" she makes one d*** good salary being so ugly.",1082419200,6,1776,4.553125
9348,5,0767809254,"This movie is wonderful for its simple story of life, enhanced by a rare combination of heavyweight talent.  The characters seem to jump off the screen because they are so homey and natural, and the deep philosophical thought into which so many movies of this type sink is almost completely absent, leaving something readily understandable and enjoyable that allows you to laugh or cry freely.
It is unusual for so many famous stars to appear in one film.  Julia Roberts is listed after many of the other names, though today she is one of the most popular and highly paid actors in the world.  Sally Field plays Julia Roberts' fretful mother, always concerned about her daughter, but a balanced concern.  Julia is the marginally rebellious daughter, who thinks her mother fusses too much over her, wanting her mother to let her lead her own life.
Much of the interaction in this movie takes place between Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine, Darryl Hannah and Sally Field.  The women gossip, criticize each other and support each other, the kind of love and friendship that seems to exist more often in smaller communities.  Dolly Parton is outgoing and friendly, as is Olympia Dukakis.  Shirley MacLaine is noisy and complains about everything, figuring that being old and wealthy allows her the right to complain.  Darryl Hannah is a very religious frumpy young woman with (gasp!) a past, though her past seems mild to many of us.  These women support each other and provide advice, but also an outlet for their wishes and hopes and problems.  They also often like to talk about each other, though in a way they try hard to be polite and supportive when they can.
Some of the funniest scenes involve Tom Skerritt as Sally Field's husband Drum.  Tom seems to have a way of doing things that provide at least smiles, and a bit of eye rolling on occasion.  Tom is funniest when he interacts with Shirley MacLaine.  Tom seems to enjoy tormenting Shirley and Shirley enjoys griping back at Tom.  While on one level it appears that the two dislike each other, the viewer also must recognize that they could have avoided each other and yet do not, so surely they must get some enjoyment out of the encounters.
The central character throughout the movie is Julia Roberts.  We discover early in the movie that she suffers from diabetes, and the effects are often severe.  The tension between Julia and Sally Field as Julia's symptoms and problems increase, and the tension with the rest of the women in the movie, increases during the movie, awaiting release.  The movie alternates between laughter and pain until near the ending that has its sad moments, but ends relatively happily as the true lesson of the movie is finally revealed.
Stories of real life are often boring or are hard to comprehend because of lack of a common background.  This story of real life has enough caricature to be funny enough to keep your attention, while being sufficiently rooted in life to allow you to feel like this life could have been yours, your parents, or your grandparents.
Some of the subject matter in this film makes it unsuitable for young members of the family.  (...)  However, I think this excellent film should be suitable for older children and all other family members.",1081814400,5,3276,4.795373665480427

The movie is packed full of well-known actresses and actors (Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Shirley McClaine, Daryl Hannah, Dolly Parton, Skerrit, Olympia Dukakis, and more) who are magnificent.
The movie starts with the preparations for the wedding of Sally Field and Tom Skerrit's daughter,  Julia Roberts.  And then you have all the friends and acquaintances who are involved.  There is the beauty parlor where all the gossip takes place, and where friendships are made.  It is funny, sad and completely absorbing.  Julia's diabetis is a big concern for everyone especially since she decided to have a child and it is something that is very hazardous to her health.
I loved Shirley McClaine, who is an outspoken woman, and her friend Olympia Dukakis.  Dolly Parton, who owns the beauty shop, and Daryl Hannah who is befriended by Dolly and the others and who has a past that they were all curious about.  It is a story that could take place in just about any town, but it took special talent to put it together to make it so wonderful.  It has everything-comedy, drama, and sadness, all put together harmoniously.

9350,5,0767809254,"In 1989, audiences were treated to an all-star cast in the film ""Steel Magnolias"", which follows the lives of several women who are all friends in a small Louisiana town.  The film was directed by Herbert Ross (1927-2001), who directed ""The Goodbye Girl"" (1977) and ""The Turning Point"" (1977, for which he received an Oscar nomination for Best Director).  It was written by Robert Harding, who had originally written ""Steel Magnolias"" as a play and also adapted Olivia Goldsmith's novel into the screenplay for ""The First Wives Club"" (1996).
The story begins with a young woman, Annelle Dupuy (Daryl Hannah), who is new to the Lousiana town and planning to work as a beautician for Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton), whose husband Spud Jones (Sam Shepard) is an often out-of-work contractor.  Impressed with her abilities, Truvy hires Annelle and they receive their first customers of the day: the wealthy widow Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis), the responsible mother M'Lynn Eatenton (Sally Field), her engaged daughter Shelby (Julia Roberts) and the eccentric/antisocial divorcee Ouiser Boudreaux (Shirley MacLaine).  Since one of the activities that most of the ladies enjoy doing is gossiping, when Ouiser begins to interrogate Annelle about her life, everyone is all ears as Annelle explains her troubled marriage and vanished husband.  Shelby then invites Annelle to come to her wedding, which Annelle does and meets a man who becomes very interested in her: Sammy Desoto (Kevin J. O'Connor).  Shelby's new husband is Jackson Latcherie (Dylan McDermott), and her outspoken father, Drum Eatenton (Tom Skerritt), often enjoys teasing Ouiser about her aging dog.  Shelby suffers from diabetes, but is determined to live as much of a normal life as possible, even when it comes into conflict with M'Lynn's concerns for her health.
With its witty script, wonderful story and engaging characters, ""Steel Magnolias"" is a very entertaining and emotional film.  Julia Roberts received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but disappointingly, Sally Field was not nominated for Best Actress for her exceptional performance, especially during the very emotional funeral scene.  Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine and Daryl Hannah performed superbly in their roles, and Dolly Parton was very well casted for her role as Truvy and did an excellent job.  Memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes at Truvy's beauty salon, Shelby's wedding, the Christmas fair, Shelby revealing her pregnancy, other scenes at Truvy's, Annelle's wedding shower, M'Lynn at the hospital, the funeral scene and the closing Easter scenes.  Overall, I rate ""Steel Magnolias"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it on widescreen DVD.",1076025600,17,2726,5.360655737704918
9351,5,0767809254,"As already mentioned here a number of times, yes, it reeks of a chick flick. But on the simple metric of number of one-liners per minute, I simply cannot think of a better comical powerhouse! The script to this movie is an example for screenwriters.
The hilarious star-studden ensemble is set in southern US, a small Louisiana town. The camaraderie is contagious and nostalgic, and the life of the characters so identifiable you'll be involved with the film immediately. There's almost several subthemes, each character has a peccadillo to share.
But the main focus of the film is the relationship between Sally Field and Julia Roberts, a domineering mother and her strong-willed but physically weak daughter respectively, the latter also plagued with diabetes. And there is a lot of time spent on Daryl Hannah's strange character development as well as the film covers a year or two via holidays.
To me, that is what most undermines the film -- I would much rather have seen more time spent on Parton and MacLaine, and even Dukakis, whose lives, in the brief glimpses we are given, seem much more interesting, and whose characters are by far much more alive and vibrant. Their barbs and quips are a compelling reason alone to watch this movie again and again!
At any rate, this is a movie you should definitely watch if you haven't already, and if you have, watch it again. What a wonderful slice of life, drama and delectable humor!",1074902400,11,1434,4.809716599190283
9352,5,0767809254,"This is the story of five women who basically socialize at Truvy's Beauty shop.  The actresses are Dolly Parton (Truvy) Sally Field (M'Linn -- if  that's how you spell it) Olympia Dukakis (Clairee) Shirley MacLaine (Ouizer) and Daryl Hannah (Anelle)and of course, the one and only Julia Roberts as Shelby.
Basically, the story revolves around Shelby who is an active person but who also has a serious case of diabetes. Shelby marries in the movie and wants very much to have a baby which, of course, would not be good for her health.  Around this bittersweet main theme are a lot of other sub-themes, many of which are funny, some of them very touching, and all of them adding to the overall good quality of this movie.
What I appreciated was the realism in the depiction of women's friendships.  At a time when the sneakiness and manipulativeness of girls' (and sometimes women's) friendships is being discussed, cussed, and dissected, this movie shows what friendship between basically good hearted women is really like.  To be sure, the gals get on each other's nerves and not all is sweetness and light, but for the most part they care a lot about each other's welfare, and at the toughest times, they band together and support each other big time.
I would recommend this movie to anyone -- including men -- in fact, I have been pleasantly surprised to find out that a lot of men enjoy the movie.

Whatever the criteria for selection, there are many candidates for this category which usually include Steel Magnolias. After seeing it again recently, I decided that calling it a ""chick flick"" demeans what director Herbert Ross and his cast and crew achieved. This film really does have wide and deep appeal to both and men and women of all ages. Of greater significance, it seems even better each time it is seen again. The reverse is true of almost all other films which touch our hearts.  As in Robert Harling's play on which it is based, all of the main characters are women: Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis), M'Lynn Eatenton (Sally Field), Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton), Annelle Depuy Desoto (Daryl Hannah), Ouiser Boudreaux (Shirley MacLaine), and Shelby Eatenton Latcherie (Julia Roberts).

MacLaine and Roberts were later nominated for an Academy Award as best actress in a supporting role; a split vote probably cost both an Oscar. My own opinion is that Field, Dukakis, and Hannah were equally deserving of that nomination. In terms of plot, not a great deal happens. The film's energy is established and then sustained by the interactions between and among the five older women. Keep in mind that this was originally a play whose plot focused almost entirely on the shared experiences of those women. Some of the scenes are hilarious, with MacLaine and Dukakis primarily responsible. However, the film also includes one extended situation which has a genuinely sad conclusion. (It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen the film to say any more about that.) I think the acting is first-rate throughout. Most of this film is highly entertaining but whenever necessary and appropriate, Ross examines serious issues with great skill. Two points need to be reiterated: Steel Magnolias can and will appeal to men as well as to women, and, it is more enjoyable each time it is seen again. Those who share my high regard for it are urged to check out Fried Green Tomatoes (1991).",1060646400,102,2173,4.934426229508197

9357,5,0767809254,"Well, I must admit when I was forced to sit down and watch this movie with my wife I was suffering some trepidation.  After all this was a chick-flick and I doubted I would be able to stay awake, or keep my lunch down for all the treacle.  I was so very wrong!  This movie has a great cast with delightful characters.  Their love for one another is self-evident and that love will warm the proverbial cockles of the viewer's heart.  Yes!  There are moments of great sadness but they are carried off well, and avoid the saccharine sweetness of so many of this genre.
In conclusion I highly recommend this movie.  It just darn well makes you feel good.......guy or gal!",1054771200,4,667,4.418032786885246
9358,3,0767809254,"Some pretty big talent (Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Julia Roberts, Darryl Hannah, Shirley MaClaine) and a good story lead me to recommend this film.  Shelby (Julia Roberts)is a head-strong diabetic who, against doctor's orders, decides to get pregnant and have a child.  Based on a true story, ""Steel Magnolias"" concerns itself with the group of strong Southern women who become Shelby's insulated comfort zone during her time of need. Some of the aspects of the film, including dialogue references, costume design and overall set design, has pegged the movie as a product of the 80's.  That isn't to say that it's not a good film.  But it just doesn't hold up quite as well as say, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"".
Columbia has given us a rather worn looking print of this movie.  Colors are slightly faded or off balance and there is some smearing of background details that comes from the overuse of noise reduction equipment in the DVD mastering process. No pixelization, some slight edge enhancement and a bit of fine detail shimmering also present.  The sound is amply presented but exhibits an equally dated characteristic.  The documentary that accompanies this feature is rather disappointing.  Although we learn why the film was written, there are virtually NO INTERVIEWS with principle cast members and very little in the way of background on how the film was made.  Also incl. theatrical trailer.  BOTTOM LINE: Still a good reason to stay home on a rainy night.  Just remember to bring Kleenex.",1047168000,2,1496,4.991935483870968

Yes the movie mirrors 1983's TERMS OF ENDEARMENT quite a bit, but this movie works with the star studded cast who all turn in worthy performances of Oscar's. It's such a special movie about love and friendship between these women, and the ties that bind them together. Roberts' character suffers from diabetes and has a child against her doctors orders. Her character needs a kidney transplant and her on screen mom played by Sally Field, gives her kidney. However the kidney is rejected and ultimately Roberts' character dies. Truly tugs at the heartstrings and Field gives a demanding performance with her outburst at the end after the funeral. Parton, Hannah, MacLaine and Dukakis turn in comical performances that make you smile and warms your heart. Overall truly a beautiful movie that I do consider a classic.",1046649600,,977,5.1125
9360,5,0767809254,"Ok YES I admit I am a hopeless romantic.  This movie is another that just touches and uplift's the human heart and spirit  at its very core.  The ladies in this movie are all strong opinionated souls.  There is nothing on earth more beautiful and femine than a self assured strong willed woman who lives life boldly with passionate joy that is so in touch with itself she demands\inspires all around her to live fully as she does.
These ladies in their own unique ways teach about love, faith, hope and charity.  The good ladies in this movie are so much fun too.  Watching this movie is just a pure joy.  As a black man I must say that the fact this movie never really showed the beauty of today's educated fun modern southern black woman does take away from the DVD's overall impact.  This movie suffers intensely from its culturally monotoned nature, an ugly hell from which nothing can rescue it.

9361,4,0767809254,"Steel Magnolias fits perfectly into that particular genre of movie that deals, quite simply, with the concept of `everyday life'. It's just that everyday life, as the movie convincingly reveals, is never quite that simple.
The film details the lives of several women living in America's Deep South and how, despite their obvious differences, each is a supportive friend to each of the others. Within this complex web of relationships, set across the backdrop of a small community, all emotional aspects of life are explored from birth to marriage to death - even religion gets something of a look in. Through this exploration we get to understand and know more about the characters, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.
Steel Magnolias is, in short, an emotional film: it's both happy and sad, it will make you laugh and it will probably make you cry. And that's just the way it should be, after all that's the way of real life.",1042416000,,944,4.833333333333333

Steel Magnolias is truly a slice of life, full of laughter, tears, frustrations, change, loss and joy!
And just when I thought the movie couldn't get any better, the DVD version became available. The deleted scenes and other tidbits are nice but the overwhelming reason to buy this version of the film is for the interview with the author. I was floored to learn that Steel Magnolias is a 'real life' story which only makes every scene in this already powerful movie that much more meaningful.

It is funny and thoughtful and about life and how we live it to its fullest everyday. DVD features include a really good featurette and not so good commentary by the director Herbert Ross.

9369,4,0767809254,"An extremely episodic story of several smalltown southern women whose social lives revolve around meetings in the local beauty parlor, STEEL MAGNOLIAS' script and performances are dogged by an aura of artificiality--but it scarcely matters, for the film is a tremendous amount of fun.
Some of the performances are more successful than others, with Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Julia Roberts, and Darryl Hannah coming out on top (I am greatly surprised that so many other reviewers dislike Hannah's performance, which seems to me considerably less artificial than many others--but perhaps since I'm actually Southern I have a different perspective); Sally Fields and Dolly Parton are less successful, but not in any sense that actually distracts from the fun.  Perhaps most surprising in a film which focuses on women are the brief but impressive performances from the male supporting cast, which includes effective performances by Tom Skerrit, Sam Shepherd, and Dylan McDermott, and which serve to ground the film with a sense of the broader community in which the women live.
The script abounds in zinging one-liners (""If you can't say something nice, come sit by me!"") and often hilarious situations (imagine Olympia Dukakis surrounded by naked men in the highschool football team's locker room); it also contains some very touching segments sure to choke up all but the most heartless viewer. And although the story is extremely manipulative and rather predictable, those factors don't actually get in the way of its effectiveness.  While probably not a ""great film"" by any serious standard, it is tremendously good-natured, well-intended, and extremely entertaining, and most people will find that it lingers pleasantly in mind and holds up well under repeated viewings.",1009670400,,1780,5.399280575539568

The fact is that ""Steel Magnolias"" is a very good, nice film. Have we seen it before?. Yes. ""Terms Of Endearment"", a better movie, comes immediatley to mind. This movie works because of the cast : Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Tom Skerritt, and Dylan McDermott. These people give some of the best performances of their careers. The plot centers around a group of southern women who share each other's business while going to a local beauty shop. Another storyline includes Sally Fields' daughter(Roberts)getting married. If you haven't seen this movie, then that's all I'll say. Field gives a great performance. Her outburst scene towards the end is a real stand out. However, MacLaine steals every frame she's in as a sharp tongued southerner. Julia Roberts shines here too. Director Herbert Ross has a nice eye for detail. The film looks sharp. The movie has a fair share of intelligent comedy and drama. Just enough for everyone. So, come on guys!.

But as a matter of honest opinion, to place it in such a small subject field is an insult to the film. As Fried Green Tomatoes did in the latter years, Steel Magnolias show's how strong relationships can be. To know how important it is to remain steadfast with your friend's, so they are there when you need them. Through humor, this film version of the play displays the caring qualities between a lovable bunch of nag's. With the griping and gossip that they spring, you hear their form of hilarious communication. Based on a true heartbreaking story, the screenwriter has done a terrific job choreographing the language between the six ladies to show the up's and down's of life, and being a diabetic. (""Shelby's"" character, portrayed by Julia Robert's, is in fact the screenwriter's sister. My heart goes out to him.) The DVD is everything it should be, and makes it even more enjoyable than the old scratchy copy I had. I don't like admitting everything to the whole world, but if a story comes along that is very uplifting and yet sad, I can usually hold back the water works.

9374,5,0767809254,"It'd be hard to go wrong with a cast like this, but just to add that extra bit of insurance, get a smart, funny script and a director who understands women.  There you go, Steel Magnolias.  This film about six women whose lives are bound together both by kindred spirits, and by the joys and sorrows of their lives, could have ended up sappy and maudlin. Instead, saved by wit, a fine edge of meanness, and a goofy charm, this film really works.  It makes the friendships feel real, the characters seem knowable and familiar.  These aren't perfect women with perfect lives who smile through tragedy.  These are women you know, or would like to know.  There's not a bad performance in the whole film, and the supporting cast is as good as the leads are.  They'll have you weeping helplessly one minute and screaming with laughter the next.
One caveat: One of the selling points for the DVD is the promise of 9 extra scenes.  Frankly, there is a good reason why these never made it into the film.  They're unmemorable; they don't advance the plot, or contribute much to characterization.  If this is the make-or-break point for buying the DVD, I wouldn't bother.

Well, that and the local Presbyterian church.  Olympia Dukakis, Daryl Hannah, Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field all have terrific roles as well.  The whole cast is extraordinary.

Those two seasoned actresses were made for those roles. I loved the banter between them. As cranky as Shirley MacLaine's character was, deep down inside she really wasn't as mean as one might think. Towards the end of the movie the viewer gets to see a glimpse of the real Ms. Weezer. Sally Field was simply amazing in this film.

9380,4,0767809254,"A pleasant mix of comedy and tear-jerking drama, Steel Magnolias is a heartwarming movie with a strong message, no matter what happens life goes on and the strong can survive almost anything. This movie takes place 1980s Louisiana and features a small town gaggle of women who congregate at Truvy's Beauty Spot to laugh, cry gossip and generally experience life. Each women has their own strong personality and brings something unique to the film.  Steel Magnolias is adapted from the play of the same name by Robert Harling. The movie flashes through several milestones in the lives of six women. M'lynn Eatenton played by Sally Field is the mother of Shelby Eatenton (Julia Roberts). And the two seem to be the main focus of the movie. Strong M'lynn and caring but naive Shelby make the perfect mother-daughter team. The movie begins with the wedding day of Shelby, and after a nail polish crisis the two head to Truvy's beauty parlor to gossip and laugh. Dolly Parton plays a caring and hopelessly romantic ""southern belle,"" named Truvy Jones; who is constantly trying to elicit some romance from her husband, Spud (Sam Shepard).  Providing a scapegoat of sorts is nervous newcomer, Annelle (Daryl Hannah) who soon finds out the gossipy nature of the group when she announces she ""isn't sure"" if she is married or not.  And of course, no clique would be complete without the sarcastic pessimist. Shirley MacClaine slips artfully into the role of Ouiser Boudreaux. The rich seemingly nasty woman who is rarely seen without a floppy straw hat and a huge slobbering dog.  Providing the perfect compliment to Ouisers acrid personality is best friend Clariee (Olympia Dukasis). Miss Clairee is always ready with gossip or a playful insult of Ouiser. Ouiser, Truvy and Clairee are the main suppliers of the quirky, well timed one-liners that add spice to the movie as a whole.  Being a real ""chick flick"" Steel Magnolias contains a few, underdeveloped male characters who are regarded more as scenery than actual characters. Drum Eatenton, played by Tom Skerritt is M'lynns husband who spends half of his screen time shooting pigeons from trees and the other half grinning blankly or snarling at Ouiser. Shelby's husband, Jackson Latcherie (Dylan McDermott) is upstaged in most of his scenes and then forgotten about completely. Annelle's boyfriend, Sammy Desoto (Kevin J. O'Connor) really only has one poorly executed, pointless scene before he too is forgotten; only to reappear at the end wearing a bunny suit. And who could forget Truvy's Husband Spud, probably everyone as his few scenes involve him reclining on a bed, drinking beer, watching television and being grumpy.  Despite the appearance that these women are dippy southern women, several tragedies call them all to action, where each shows they are more than meets the eye. The character and will of the six is gradually introduced as the viewer moves from one milestone to another. The true acting brilliance of Sally Field is presented in one poignant scene, where M'lynn, hysterically asks God why. The captivating tear-jerking scene complete with Fields signature locked jaw distant eyes is broken only by a lame attempt at comedic relief. In which M'lynn switches from pissed to amused in a matter of seconds. With one motion the scene goes from classically emotional to pathetic and back again.  Steel Magnolias is quite possibly the funniest movie that will also make you cry. These six witty southern belles show their strength and character time and again, proving they are true Steel Magnolias.  Steel Magnolias was directed by Herbert Ross, written by Robert Harling is a  TriStar Pictures production. Steel Magnolias received a 1990 Oscar nomination for Julia Roberts as best supporting actress and a 1990 Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture-Sally Field. And in 1990 Julia Roberts won a Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her work in Steel Magnolias.

9385,1,0767809254,"This movie really borders on absurd. The play was simple, heart-felt and centered more on the goings on in the beauty salon. This movie is so overproduced that it diminishes the story and the performances.  Sally  Field gives a credible performance. Shirley McLaine and Olympia Dukakis  play their characters like a cartoon. And Dolly Parton proves she is really  sweet but can't act her way out of a paper bag.  As for Julia  Roberts...well she has screen presence, but she just can't act. Forget this  super-size cotton candy film.",964483200,13,533,4.921348314606742

Where else can you learn that the only thing that separates us from the animals is our ability to accessorize?  Or that being gentlemanly  is to take the dishes out of the sink 'for ya pee in it?
This movie has  provided countless hours of entertainment, and probably the most one-liners  of any feature film ever released.  That it is coming out on DVD with *9*  deleted scenes (Marshall and Jackson together at last?  Weeza hookin' up  with Owen Jenkins and his Mercedes Benz?) is the best news I've had all  day!  The possibilities are limitless.
Needless to say, it is a must have  for any gay man's library, and if some of the straight men out there can  appreciate it, more power to 'em.

However, you don't watch this movie for the stars in it, but rather watch it for the sheer enjoyment of  watching the characters intertwine with laughter, wit, grace and heart felt  emotion.  I LOVE this movie.  I have seen it 1000 times and still LOVE it.  If you love seeing movies that reach all 5 senses, then see this movie.  I  guarentee that you will love it.",960595200,2,478,4.3522727272727275
9388,5,0767809254,"I simply adore this movie! Most incredibly, it was believable. This little Louisiana town actually exists.....I've been there and it is precious! For the movie, I will say that it transports you from hilarious true-to-life  antics to gut wrenching, sob evoking moments of emotional anguish. It is a  true classic. It has it all. The scenery is fabulous, the cast incredible,  the sincerity fabulous, and the humor unparalleled. Recommend this movie?  Are you serious? YES!  Rent it! Buy IT!  But most of all, watch it. Watch  it during the times you need a laugh. Watch it when you can't get your  mother on the phone. Watch it when you need a dose of ""southern  reality"". Watch it when you have no reason whatsoever. Watch when you  are up late with nobody to talk with. Watch it for wedding tips. You pick  your reason. I highly recommend this for anyone, male or female.",959731200,2,873,4.677631578947368
9389,5,0767809254,"I have seen many films, but have never seen one that I would go back to as many times as this one.  Each character provides a special ingrediate that make the entire cast shine.  A must see film for anyone who has a heart. It  will make you laugh,cry and feel emotions that are in many people, dormant.  Highly recommend this one.",959731200,,330,4.274193548387097
9390,5,0767809254,"We have rented this movie before, but never had time to watch it. Then tonight it was on TV, and I decided to watch it. I'm sorry I didn't watch it before! It's such a wonderful story, and the acting is great. It's  starts with Shelby(Julia Roberts) getting married, goes through the lives  of her and five other women, and ends with her dying. There really is no  main theme 'till the end, other than the same women are in it. I cried at  the end when she died, but realized how special it was! Men might even  enjoy this one! A must see.",959299200,,539,4.144230769230769
9391,5,0767809254,"With all the attention Julia Roberts is getting these days, it's an excellent time to buy and enjoy the film that contains her best performance, Steel Magnolias.
As the doomed but optimistic daughter of  Sally Field and Tom Skerrit, she holds her own in a cast of movie divas,  including Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton, and (in her best  film work, as well), Darryl Hannah.
The film is basically a warm, upbeat  character study of a group of women friends, played out in a beautiful  Louisiana bayou town. The story begins with Roberts' wedding, then carries  on through the ups and downs of the friends' lives. The male characters in  the story are barely seen, and occasionally come across as insensitive  (Roberts' husband), or buffoons (Hannah's boyfriend), yet one of the joys  of this movie is that you come to love the women so much, you don't mind  the men's shortcomings, and start liking them, too!
The standout  performances of the film are from Roberts, and MacLaine, as a spinster with  a sarcastic tongue, and, ultimately, a heart of gold. Her scenes with  Dukakis are hilarious, yet full of the warmth that makes this film so  special!
A couple of things usually overlooked, but worth mentioning; the  enchanting film score (I wish the soundtrack would be rereleased!), and a  bit part by Janine Turner, before 'Northern Exposure' made her a  star.
This is a very special film, for both Roberts' fans, and anyone who  wants to believe in the healing powers of friendship. Yes, this film can be  defined as a 'chick flick', but guys, you'll end up enjoying it, too!",950659200,19,1596,4.801470588235294
9392,5,0767809254,"This is a wonderful movie. Whether the characters are bitching around with each other, gossiping, or grieving for the loss of a good woman, Steel Magnolias is filled with wit, humor, love, and tragedy. Let's start with  Julia Roberts as the generous Shelby Eatenton-Latcherie, a diabetic whose  choice to have a baby may kill her. Julia Roberts captures Shelby's wit and  loving nature perfectly. Here are some quotes:
I'd rather have thirty  minutes of wonderful, than a lifetime of nothing special.
You're just mad  because you no longer have a say in my life and that drives you up the  wall! You're ready to spit nails because you can't call the shots.
The  marvelous actress Sally Field plays her mother, M'Lynn, who loves her  daughter so much that she gives Shelby one of her kidneys. Her reactions to  Shelby's pregnancy and the aftermath of Shelby's death are impossible to  keep a dry eye. The funeral scene is a display of raw grief that few  actresses can equal. Dolly Parton is a natural as gossipy beautician Truvy  Jones, whose marriage is falling apart. Olympia Dukakis brings sarcastic  but lovable Clairee Belcher to life. Her dialogue sparkles: ""They were  both high. They'd been smoking everything but their shoes,"" and  ""She's the new mayor's wife. We hate her."" Daryl Hannah is  adequete as shy prayer Annelle Dupey Desoto, although she could have been  better. And finally there's Shirley MacLaine as the extremely grouchy  Ouiser ""People are nice to me because I have more money than God""  Boudreaux. Tom Skerrit and Dylan McDermott are great in their supporting  roles. Steel Magnolias is the story of six Southern woman who stand up to  life's tragedies and find laughter, wisdom, and grace in a beauty parlor.  Unparallelled.",946512000,5,1752,4.948453608247423
9393,5,0767809254,"I have seen this movie over 10 times and I enjoy it every time I watch it.  Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Dolly Partin, Olympia Dukakis, Shirley McClain, and Daryl Hannah give stellar perfomances.  It is not a  fast-paced, full of action movie, but a slower, interesting movie about the  lives of six Southern women.",945129600,,314,4.7592592592592595
9394,5,0767809254,"Stellar performances across the board help to encapsulate the essence of Southern quaintness. This movie emphasizes the importance of networks of support -- family, friends, community -- in facing our daily trials and  life-altering events. The acting in this movie is so phenomenal, that it  requires multiple viewings, focusing on specific characters during each  viewing, in order to fully appreciate the film. Most recently, I've enjoyed  the compassionate bluntness of Dolly Parton's character Truvy.  To all who  buy this video, enjoy.",943142400,4,541,5.617283950617284
9395,3,0767809254,This is an okay movie really not a good at all because Shelby dies at the end. She wants to have kids and she has a boy. He cries when she falls and slips on the ground.,940636800,,169,3.5945945945945947
9396,4,0767809254,"The female characters in this story would have made Varina Davis the flower of the confederacy,turn in her grave for their unsouthern & unladylike behaviour,especially the character of Ouiser Boudreaux played by  Shirley MacLaine. But they do capture our attention,especially with the  wedding preparations at the start. The six main actors give off wonderful  performances and Julia Roberts is a scene stealer,for which she was  deservedly nominated as best supporting actress. It is undoubtedly a 'chic  flick' but guys will enjoy the humour too. Rent it out this weekend,invite  your friends...and bring lots of tissues.",934848000,,623,5.505263157894737
