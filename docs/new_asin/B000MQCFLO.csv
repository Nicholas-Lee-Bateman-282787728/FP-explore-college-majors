2738719,5,B000MQCFLO,"this is the last of the great simpson seasons. i have seen the new ones like season 15 beyond and they make no sense. i am a big fan but enough is enough. i compair the simpsons to metalica why, the first half was greater than last half by far. if the simpson movie is like the season 11 on, then it's going to suck, but it the writers and producers look at it like the first couple of seasons then it will be good.

season 10 is my second favorite to season 8.

would i recomend season 10, yes i would. but season 11 and beyond, i would have to say continue at your own prefrence.",1172534400,13,581,3.9572649572649574

2738721,5,B000MQCFLO,"Contrary to the folks who say the 9th season was the last good one, I find the show still interesting today.  The 10th season has great episodes, my favorite being ""Wizard of Evergreen Terrace.""  I have this as a DVD recording from the internet off of a VHS recording, so I'm looking forward to the crisp quality of the original.

Now the question (ok, 2 questions):

1)  I've read that the DVD won't be released until August 27 -- could this possibly be true?  The sets were finally coming out at a reasonable rate, now we have to wait 8 months between releases?  Any clarification (hopefully a closer date) would be great.

2)  Will there be a tribute of some sort to Phil Hartman?  He was (is) one of my all-time favorite actors, and it's a shame that he passed, especially in such a horrible way.  They retired his characters, but I'd like to see a 15-minute or so production showing him in some of the recording sessions and so forth.  It may not happen, but it would be very nice.

That's all - looking forward to the release (not in August, please, Fox!)",1171411200,6,1061,4.407216494845361

2738818,4,B000MQCFLO,"The Simpsons Season 10 starts off kinda slow, but then picks up.

The set comes with a cool booklet that has s studio tour theme to it, and episode guide. Lots of great episodes here, such as Treehouse of Horror IX (wait till you see what happens to Maggie!!), Mayored To The Mob (with the voice of Mark Hamill as a washed-up actor desperately reliving past glories  Use the fork!!), Im With Cupid where we get to see more of Apus wife Manjula, Simpsons Bible Stories (probably the best episode of Season 10), They Saved Lisas Brain with its Stephen Hawking cameo, and season finale Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo, when the Simpsons go to Japan!

The collection is over four discs with 23 episodes (six per disc, but only five on disc four), and each menu (main menu, episode menu, etc), is animated with relevant images from the episodes on that disc, which is good fun and a nice added touch. Theres commentary for every episode, but very few other bonus features except for a few that have deleted scenes. Unfortunately, you cant see the deleted scenes on their own, but can toggle an on/off to view them together with the whole episode,.

Lots of great lines of dialogue in this episode:

Marge: Oh no, its the Apocalypse. Bart, are you wearing clean underwear?

Homer, pulling Lisa down from her ascent to Heaven: Where do you think you're going, missy?
Lisa: DAD!!

Homer: It teaches them while they learn!

Homer: Shaving my shoulders getting it all shaved off

Homer: Your paintings look like what they look like.

Marge: I guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy.
Homer: Now you're making sense.

Pharaoh: Please fear my wrath. PLEASE!!

Milhouse: Everythings coming up Milhouse.

Lisa: Only one person in a million woujld find that funny.
Professor Frink: Yes, we call that the Dennis Miller ratio.

Carl: Lets make litter out of these literati!

Beaten up by Stephen Hawking. Stephen Hawking to Homer: Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing",1405728000,,1971,4.7558823529411764

2738821,5,B000MQCFLO,"Some say that the show starts to go downhill starting with this season. Although the show does seem to decline in quality, it still is a great show and is a good season to own. This season was nominated for 2 Emmy Awards and won 2 Annie Awards for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Television Program and Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television Production. Not as many as the show is use to. This is also the 2nd year Mike Schully was the show runner and who many fans believe is the guy responsible for the shows turning point. This season also has to say goodbye to a friend from the Simpson universe. Phil Hartman's last performance is in episode ""Bart the Mother"" Where Bart kills a bird with a BB gun and feels guilty for it. Resulting in him nursing the birds unhatched eggs left in the nest. Phil Hartman was shot to death by his wife a few months before the episode was to air. He was the voice of Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz.

 Some memorable episodes from this season include episodes such as ""Sunday Cruddy Sunday"" Where Homer gets a bus load of Springfieldians and heads to Super Bowl XXXIII (33) only to find out when they get there that the tickets are counterfeit. ""Homer to the Max"" After being ridiculed due to sharing the same name as a clumsy oaf of a cop on t.v., Homer changes his name to a kick a** one, Max Power. ""30 minutes over Tokyo"" You guessed it, the Simpsons visit Japan... and of course run into trouble. ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" A refreshing episode for Treehouse of Horror fans as the Simpsons fall asleep in church and each dream is a mini story about bible stories. (A pretty good episode even though it didn't sound so great on paper.) ""Mom and Pop Art"" Homer ""accidently"" becomes an artist due to his rage. Marge is a bit envious and Homer struggles to stay a 'pop'ular artist. ""Treehouse of Horror IX"" Homer becomes a killer with a new toupee, Bart and Lisa are trapped in the t.v. and Itchy and Scratchy try to kill them, and The Simpsons appear on the Jerry Springer show because Kang is Maggie's real father!

 Not as many stand out episodes as the previous seasons had, but is decent. This 23 episode season had quite a lot of celebrity guests such as Lisa Kudrow, Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee Gifford, Jerry Springer, Ed McMahon, Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Ron Howard, George Carlin, Mark Hamill, John Madden, Troy Aikman, Dan Marino, Dolly Parton, Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund, and many, many more.

2738871,3,B000MQCFLO,This is truly where The Simpsons took a sharp downturn. I loved all the previous seasons. Every episode from season 1 through 9 are gold. Season 10 however is a huge disappointment. It's just not funny. It's not witty or clever at all. It's sad because The Simpsons was one of the best shows on television and will always be one of my favorite shows of all time (1-9 of course). The writing is just not as good as it once was. Such a shame when a great show like this becomes so hollow.,1356912000,2,486,4.180851063829787

2738876,4,B000MQCFLO,"Season 10 is definitely the turning point in the series, where it went from hilarious, clever, and fresh to predictable, oafish, and unbearable.  Seasons 4 - 9 were definitely the golden age of the series, with Seasons 7 and 8 being my favorites. However, Season 10 is the start of the rapid downhill fall for the Simpsons. Don't get me wrong, there's still some decent episodes in this season, such as"" The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace"", ""Viva Ned Flanders"", ""Make Room for Lisa"", ""Mom and Pop Art"", and ""When You Dish Upon a Star"", however, the season is filled with mostly bad episodes.",1344384000,,588,4.70873786407767
2738877,4,B000MQCFLO,"First off, I have to say that I absolutely love the Simpsons. Seasons 3 to 9 are still among the best television ever produced. The stories had broken out of the middle class family sitcom mold of the first 2 seasons yet were still cohesive; the writing was tight, without any padding; the characters were outrageous but still had emotional depth; the jokes were often thoroughly but subtly set up, callbacks were often surprising, and among the more obvious one-liners and sight gags, very few fell flat. 3 and 9 were, in my opinion, the upward and downward slope from the absolute peak of seasons 4 to 8, but were still great.

Season 10 is when things definitely started getting shakier, before completely going off a cliff in season 11. No single episode in season 10 is truly bad, but the bad signs are definitely there. The writing starts relying more on an uneven string of throwaway one-liners that seldom reveal a deeper character underneath, or make incisive social commentary, and that start to fall flat with increasing frequency. Callback jokes are often seen from a mile away and sight gags aren't as clever. The stories themselves became more unwieldy, entailing ever more outlandish scenarios, and they're often quickly set up at the beginning and then neatly tied up at the end, with lots of fluff and meandering in between.

I hadn't seen season 9 and 10 in a few years and watching them again, it's really surprising just how quickly the quality deteriorated. Even sadder is the fact that the show is still on, and that this turn for the worse happened basically a third of the way through the show's run. I can't bring myself to watch the new seasons; it's too risky.

Still, this season deserves 4 stars. Even though it's not the best Simpsons season, it's still really good, and it's still a lot better than much of the drivel on TV, both when it originally aired and especially now. If anything, it's interesting to see it as the inflection point from the show's golden era to what it's become today.",1343779200,11,2023,4.692957746478873

The last few have had some hits and misses. But the overall body of work has been very good. Season 10 is no exception"" Bart The Mother"", ""Lisa Gets An ""A"" "" and ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" are probably the three weakest links in the chain. And I would still hold them up to the ""best"" Family Guy and South Park episodes and let them stand on their own.

People who look to Family Guy, with its constant barrage of poop and pee ""jokes"", and the over the top sexual connotations along with the South Park  characters  spewing obscenities and making numerous scatological references, as good social commentary, miss out on much of the clever lines from The Simpsons.

Many a comedian has proven that you don't need to be Mr. Potty Mouth to be funny. The Simpsons proves this over and over again. Even when they had the opportunity to let Homer and company loose on the big screen, they didn't have him dropping the F Bomb or any others for that matter. I find the celebrity appearances amusing. But I agree that sometimes they are a bit too contrived.

Overall, a bad Simpsons episode still beats anything from ""2 and a Half Men"" or most of the live action sitcoms out there.",1336348800,,1310,4.419087136929461

After skimming the other reviews I think it's safe to say that, and I agree with, the very best seasons are 4-8 with 3 and 9 being excellent as well but at a slightly lower percentage. How I personally rate a season is by the number of great episodes compared to what I feel are the mediocre/poor eps; the eps of seasons 4-8 having almost all great eps IMO! Season ten is about 50:50, which is still pretty good but simply cannot hold a candle to the writing of past years. I don't know if some or most of the really great writers started moving to bigger and better things during this season, the Simpsons is a bit of a stepping stone in regards to writers, or what the deal is here but this season is clearly the turning point in overall writing quality for this show's wonderful subtlety and satire.

The special features are great that include deleted scenes, butterfinger and intel commercials that aired around the time this season came out, 2 featurettes, and a sneak peek for the simpsons movie.

I thought $40-50 was a bit pricy for this when it came out, but I got it at best buy when it was on sale for $16. $18 isn't a bad price either.

That being said, this is probably the last season of Simpsons I'll buy in chronological order. The series got very dull afterwards especially due to the change of writers and excessive pop culture/celebrity references used.

Many episodes should prove very satisfying for fans of cerebral cartoon comedy. ""Homer to the Max"" guarantees Homer fans immense satisfaction, as does the ridiculously hilarious ""Lard of the Dance"", where Homer actually attempts to make a living out of selling used grease, and takes Bart out of school to assist in the venture. Side-splitting stuff.

""Mayored to the Mob"" is another highlight. Firstly, there's the bit in Mayor Quimby's limo where Quimby is taking time to advise Homer to accord himself with the sense of duty and respect demanded by employment with the mayor's office, only to then instruct him to honk at a scantilly clad lady walking down the street (Quimby: I couldn't be happier with how that went!)

And then later, when it's revealed that Fat Tony has been milking rats to honour his contract to supply Springfield Elementary's milk, he says: ""I don't get it. Everybody loves the rats, so why not the rats' milk?""

Of course, Season 10 is a season for Mike Scully fans (Scully being one of the show's big-wigs), and so, as a fan, I'm a little biased.

And, most importantly, Season 10 is an honourable effort from a cast and crew reeling from the recent tragedy of Phil Hartman's death...and with it, the death of Troy McLure and Lionel Hutz.",1251936000,2,1451,4.764940239043825

2738926,5,B000MQCFLO,"Season ten was an historic season of the Simpsons. Granted, I like many other reviewers here, think season 9 was better, some might say, the best.

However, season ten had many important things, such as the last Phil Hartman episode (forever a sad day in Simpsons, Newsradio, comedy, etc). Also guest stars included the voices of Lisa Kudrow, Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee Gifford, Jerry Springer, Ed McMahon, Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, George Carlin, Mark Hamill, The Moody Blues, Cyndi Lauper, John Madden, Troy Aikman, Dan Marino, Pat Summerall, Roosevelt Grier, Fred Willard, Dolly Parton, Rupert Murdoch, Yo La Tengo, Elton John, Hank Williams, Jr., Jasper Johns, Isabella Rossellini, Jack La Lanne, Stephen Hawking, and George Takei.

Episodes such as Hell Toupee (classic), D'Oh in the Wind (just watch it), Mayored to the mob(luke, be a jedi tonight), Homer to the Max (one of my top 5 fave episodes ever), and Simpsons over Tokyo (my favorite from this season) all combine to make for a solid Simpsons experience.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in comedy, the Simpsons, or as a gift to someone who does. A very funny show, still in its prime/early-early decline. DEFINITELY worth the time and expense.

2738930,4,B000MQCFLO,"In Season 10, the Simpsons are starting to show some of the faults that make more recent seasons uneven and less enjoyable.  This is not the fault of the writers per se - it's hard to keep characters and situations fresh when a show passes the decade mark.  Thus, as much as I admire the absurdity of the Simpsons' writing, starting in Season 10 the writers too often cross the border from absurd to outright silly.  For example, in this season Mr. Burns captures the Loch Ness Monster (in ""Burns Can't Buy Me Love"").  It would be okay for such an even to occur in a Hallowe'en episode, for example, but it doesn't feel right as a regular season show.  Similarly, although the 3-mini-story episode ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" the Hallowe'en episode gimmick of telling Bible stories as three short stories proliferates in later seasons, but generally they are inferior episides (especially on repeated viewings).  So, a list of the best episodes from this season is shorter than for a season between 4 and 8, but there are still some great episodes, such as

Treehouse of Horrors IX - featuring Maggie as the son of the alien Kodos.  Also has Bart and Lisa teleported into an Itchy and Scratchy catoon.

When You Dish Upon a Star - Homer becomes a gopher for Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, who have a vacation house in Springfield.  Featuring an especially memorable guest starring performance by Ron Howard (""Homer, we're out of vodka!"")

Mayored to the Mob - When Mark Hammill asks for a volunteer from the audience to help him act out a scene from Star Wars, the Bi-Mon Sci-Fi Con erupts in a riot.  Homer saves both Hammill and the Mayor, leading to Homer becoming the Mayor's bodyguard.

Homer to the Max - Homer has his name legally changed to Max Power (""I got it from a hair drier"").  As a result of his hip new name, he and Marge end up in Ed Beagley Jr.'s protest group, chained to old-growth forest trees.

30 Minutes Over Tokyo - my favourite ""Simpsons on Vacation"" episode (so far).  They are in Tokyo (obviously) where Homer and Bart end up in jail, and the whole family suffers seizures while watching the local TV station.  Guest stars George Takei as a sadistic game show host on whom the Simpsons depend on supplying their way home.

Unfortunately, many of the other episodes are marred by inconsistency - they are very funny in places, but become silly and/or cannot maintain a whole story.  I previously pointed out the appearance of the Loch Ness Monster, but we also have the Simpsons descending into Hell (and not in a Hallowe'en episode), a Godzilla attack, and a second wife for both Homer and Flanders.  There is the fortunate balance of a fantastic set of guest stars, especially the aforementioned Hammill (who also participates in the episode's audio commentary) and Stephen Hawking.  Thus, the season is well worth buying on DVD, but the ""cracks in the show's hilarious facade"" are starting to appear, and this is one of the last seasons I will be purchasing.

There is the usual slate of extras - audio commentary on every episode, some layout artists demonstrating their crafts, and the all-important inclusion of deleted scenes.  Somehow the audio commentaries remain fresh and interesting, even 10 seasons into the show (a marked contrast to the commentaries on, say, ""Friends"" that are stale by the time they reach Season 5, even though they only do 3-4 a season).",1215648000,2,3395,4.726655348047538

I have all the first nine seasons of ""The Simpsons"", and yes, it is some of the greatest, cleverest, pointiest American television ever produced. And the first ten episodes of season ten are really funny as well, although it becomes clear that from around episode five, the characters no longer have the same depth to them; they become more cliched and, yes, cartoonish. Perhaps that's when the holdover episodes ran out or something.

I'm looking at the list of season ten episodes right now, and episode ten of season ten is the last really funny, really clever episode of the season. Sorry guys, but it is. You can't honestly tell me that you think 'Marge Simpson in: ""Screaming Yellow Honkers""' and ""Mom and Pop Art"" is up there with ""Krusty Gets Kancelled"" or ""Bart of Darkness"".

Halfway through season ten is where the Simpsons stopped being something truly special. Surprisingly few really clever and funny episodes can still be found scattered throughout the following seasons, but season eight was the last great Simpsons season. Season nine was merely really good, and season ten is the last DVD set I'm going to buy.

2738939,5,B000MQCFLO,"Since I'm overdue to review this season, I'd figure today would be good to finally give it my 2 cents. The 10th season is another excellent season of the Simpsons, filled with new (idiotic) adventures and more character development. The best episodes are Wild Barts Can't Be Broken, Viva Ned Flanders (come... who wouldn't love seeing Ned completely wasted?, Homer Simpson In: Kidney Trouble (the ending totally makes the episode for me), I'm With Cupid, Maximum Homerdrive (the sleeping pills and the caffeine pills scene is gold), and Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo. I also have to give special note to Make Room For Lisa, which explores the strained connection between Homer and Lisa, and shows a side of Lisa that every Simpson fan knew, at heart, was there, but it was never really explored. Of course, all of the episodes are great in there own way. There are some that aren't as good as others, granted, but there aren't any mediocre episodes to be found.

It's far too often that a TV show is golden during its first 3 or 4 seasons, but then declines into pretentious idiocy that tries too hard to be funny, and it shows that the writers know they can't recapture the fire that the old episodes had *COUGH* Family Guy *COUGH*. However, The Simpsons is one of those rare shows that never loses it's genius or credibility. Yes, there are some episodes that don't stand out as much as the others, but that happens in every show. Even after nearly 20 years, they still have plenty of ideas stored for new episodes. Hopefully, however, the writers and the actors who play the voices have been looking for new work. The show only has 19 or 20 more seasons to go at best. ;)

As shows like Family Guy and American Dad and South Park started rolling out of the gate, following in THE SIMPSONS footsteps, many criticized the Simpsons as being too slow and too tame. Yet, that's its secret. It's not that it's too slow, it's found the perfect combination of too much and not enough. The beauty of THE SIMPSONS is that it can be enjoyed by those of all ages, colors and creeds.

It uses tact and intelligence to deliver its punchlines. It takes those jokes that kids shouldn't get and delivers them in a way that they won't, but the older viewers will. While the other cartoons are in your face. The Simpsons uses tact.

I can't exactly put my finger on why;  just that the quality of the episodes just hasn't left me with the urge to keep watching this season.

but this is the point where the cracks begin to show.  a change from the occasional joke falling flat to entire subplots (senor ding dong?) and even whole episodes ('30 minutes over tokyo'), seemed somehow that the nature of the humour changed.  and yes, no-one needs to hear 'i will always love you' again.  in any context.  ever.
said that the treehouse of horrors episode is very strong with jerry springer allowing himself to be send up, homer finally getting the haircut he wanted and itchy and scratchy attempting to get their own back on those people who watch to get a thrill on the violence ('hey lise, we're in a cartoon'.  'how humiliating').  elsewhere the hippie ideal appears to be well and truly dead as homer does his best to ruin said hippies livelihood, homer wimps out on the 'opportunity' to become an organ donor and becomes an inventor ('you've got it set on ""wh0re""').  there are the usual disturbing. brilliant moments; willie gets shown to be not the man you think he is (and finds a use for vim and brillo pads most of use have never considered before), the caholic church makes a few...'changes'...and watch superintendant's reaction when ralph mispronounces his name.

2738985,4,B000MQCFLO,"I'm with the know-it-all longtime Simpsons fans who bellyache about how the old days were the best. Some will disagree but any impartial viewer who watched all the seasons in order would independently conclude that the show reached its greatest comedic brilliance in seasons 3 through 8 (give or take), before falling into a dark period in which subversion was replaced by slapstick and intelligent laughs fell to cheap guffaws. In more recent seasons the series has made a comeback, and this year's great motion picture proves that Matt Groening and the team are still capable of great things. The 10th season is actually not as unsatisfying as I remembered, and might even be a little better than the very inconsistent 9th season. But still, the show was definitely in the transitional period between the golden age and the dark age.

Some actual new ideas in the 10th season include the winning Easter trilogy ""Simpsons Bible Stories,"" and sending the family to Japan in ""Thirty Minutes over Tokyo."" There are also some fairly significant character developments for Marge in ""...'Screaming Yellow Honkers'"" Lisa in ""Make Room for Lisa,"" and Bart in ""Bart the Mother."" Unfortunately the robust supporting cast is mostly used for window dressing with few new insights into the characters (except for Apu in ""I'm with Cupid""), and these episodes continue my most objectionable trend in the latter seasons of the series - the simplified parodying of Homer. The once dense but lovably complex Homer keeps getting dumber and dumber, with his simplistic boneheadedness being played for cheap laughs to an extent that should embarrass the show's earlier writers and producers.

Homer is also at the root of the most pervasive writing problem during this period of the series - the Super Homer Syndrome. Having Homer take on a new occupation or wacky scheme practically every week, which are then never mentioned again, indicates a severe shortage of new ideas. This issue is also evident in the growing reliance on guest voice actors who play themselves, which also happens almost every week this season, bottoming out in awful slumfest ""Sunday Cruddy Sunday."" Another issue is a general lack of integration between each episode's main plotline and the side story. The most telling example is ""Lisa Gets an 'A'"" in which the main story explores an important ethical crisis for Lisa, only for the episode to be nearly ruined by the asinine side story of Homer raising a lobster. In a show that has maintained a mostly high level of quality for a whopping 18 seasons (and counting), some ups and downs are forgivable. But it would take the Simpsons a while to recover from these creeping weaknesses, which during the 10th season became more prevalent than the show's longstanding strengths.

Yes, you're attached to the show and can't possibly admit that anything associated with it can be lacking, but don't make judgments base on your emotions and simply force yourself to like anything with their faces attached to it. Leave that to female fans of Johnny Depp.

It's just straight-up lacking this time around in much the same ways 8 and 9 were. Too much reliance on celebrity cameos and topical humor (the problem being that this makes these episodes outdated too fast and impossible for them to have any element of timelessness), way too much bathroom humor (was it written for young children at this point???), and alas, way, way too many new jobs for Homer. Seriously, I know it's hard to keep a show going for 20-ish years, but making it too Homer-centric, which  basically means giving him a new career in as many episodes as possible and inserting the hackneyed line ""starting today, I'm a (fill in this blank with whatever comes to mind. Seriously, WHATEVER comes to mind!)"" just shows complete and utter desperation to please a very large yet very misguided fan base!

Please kill the show after season 20. Yes, it's a milestone. Yes, it's a nice round number. But there's NOTHING left to accomplish after that.

For some people, The Simpsons is nothing more than a huge marketing tool, but for millions of fans, The Simpsons is one of the funniest shows on TV.

- The Simpsons was the first animated television program to run in prime time since The Flintstones way back in the 1960's.

- Matt Groening drew his first images of The Simpsons on a napkin.

- The Simpsons appeared for the first time on the Tracy Ullman Show in 1987.

Watching the old episodes proves I haven't got too old for The Simpsons, but only that in later years the show chose to be more preachy than funny, more self-referential than fresh.

All you comic book nerds that sit around musing about its hey-day, need to close your laptops while watching the show and actually watch it. Instead of tuning in for five minutes then trying to be the first person to slam it on the message boards. Three words for you neo-Simpson haters, ""Worst Audience Ever"".",1181779200,9,359,4.714285714285714
2739022,5,B000MQCFLO,"It will be forever debated among Simpson fans and fanatics where, exactly, the season did the Fonz trick, but my own opinion is it hasn't gotten there yet.

As with any long running comedy show, you can't have winners (or winning seasons) all the time.  But given that some of the best episodes are still yet to come (in terms of release) Season 10 is not only a must have, but remains solid evidence this show is still the most consistent laugh getter on television in the last 50 years.

But the bottom line is this -- if you are a Simpson fan who has been buying these DVDs are you *really* going to be satisfied owning only the first nine seasons?  Pretty obviously no one who has ever laughed at even one episode will pass this set by.  So stop the debate and just go ahead and get this.",1180828800,3,792,4.253333333333333
2739023,3,B000MQCFLO,"To me this season is where the running gags start losing some steam and the reliance on ""star"" cameos really started to outshine the story and plotlines.

I do agree there are plenty of good moments but this is truly the pivotal season where the number of laugh out loud, quotable, classic scenes can be counted and from here on out they began to dwindle to where we are today. Not to say that America's favorite family doesn't still make us laugh , it's just not as often, generally not as loud and sometimes not for the intended reasons.

Homer generates most of the chuckles this season, from his beer fueled drive through the halls of Sringfield Elementary to his stint as bodyguard to the Mayor. He gets a pet lobster, becomes Max Power, takes an introspective journey in a ""whale egg"" (according to Ralph Wiggum), discovers his middle name, and of course takes Flanders to Las Vegas in one of the season's stand-out episodes (including one of my favorite lines, something about ""Vegas doesn't take kindly to out-of-towners, take your money someplace else"")

Of course the die-hards will buy this anyway and why not? It will entertain us. I will, however, bet we don't watch these episodes with the frequency and level of enjoyment of the first 8 or 9 seasons.",1180742400,36,1265,4.6891891891891895
2739024,5,B000MQCFLO,"By the time that Matt Groening's The Simpsons reached it's tenth season, the show was still going strong, and the tenth season remains one of the last great seasons of the long running animated sitcom. In this season, Homer thinks he can make a fortune by selling grease (""Lard of the Dance""), as well as growing jealous of Thomas Edison and seeking to become an inventor (""The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace""). Marge develops road rage in ""Screaming Yellow Honkers"", which satires the SUV/mother craze, Bart cares for bird eggs in ""Bart the Mother"", and striking revenge when the kids of Springfield are put on an unjust curfew in ""Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"". It's Homer though who is in the best form throughout this season, as he also chickens out in donating a kidney to Grandpa in ""Kidney Trouble"", goes to Vegas with Flanders (""Viva Ned Flanders""), and becomes a reknowned artist, well, kind of, in ""Mom and Pop Art"". Also, the season ends with the family going to Tokyo, with naturally, hilarious results. This season also featured a heavy list of guest voices including George Carlin, Martin Mull, Elton John, Lisa Kudrow, Mark Hamil, Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Fred Willard, and Stephen Hawking. The only real flaw of the tenth season of the series for me personally was this season's ""Treehouse of Horror"" episode, which features the kids getting stuck in an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon, Homer buying a possessed wig made from the hair of the recently executed Snake, and Jerry Springer popping up as well. That aside, the tenth season of the Simpsons marked one of the last great seasons of the long running show, and with the eagerly awaited movie on the way, now has never been a better time to catch up with Springfield's first family.",1180310400,16,1745,4.8006644518272426

2739029,5,B000MQCFLO,"While I can't site the episode name, number, or even season (and I don't think that makes me any less of a fan), I do remember that at the end of one of their clip shows The Simpsons did a parody of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" with the line ""We'll never stop The Simpsons"". I took that promise to heart, and I sincerely hope that they never do. I've been watching The Simpsons since right around the beginning of the series, and have seen about 95% of the episodes. I disagree with those that say that The Simpsons are going ""downhill"" or that they are not as good as they used to be. The reason that The Simpsons has been around for 18 (20) years is that the writers, producers, and voice actors have kept it from getting stale. Some things must change for the series to stay fresh. If you really watch the episodes, you can see that there are phases that the series has gone through. If The Simpsons had stayed the same as it was in the groundbreaking first season we all would have stopped watching it years ago and it would have been ultimately pulled off the air. You can't have a concept around for 20 years and expect it to always be the same as you remembered it.

The fact is, The most recent episode of The Simpsons is just as great as any episode from the much lauded season 8, just a bit different.",1177632000,10,1322,4.225296442687747

My question is what happened with the specail edition ones? You know the ones with the plastic heads of each family member, so far the only ine that is missing is Bart. Why did they stop or is the one that Amazon showing for season ten the box one and will show the special edition one when it comes out? Seems unfair to start having special edition of each family members head only to stop with one last character.

In any case, I can not wait for season ten to come out, regardless of some negative comments about the later seasons, I still enjoy watching them and will collect all the seasons as the come out until the show stops.",1175990400,3,708,4.315789473684211

This is the final season that Hartman was in before his murder in 1998. Like Chef is with south park (one of the best characters), Phil hartman's characters made the Simpsons hilarious. I offically called Seasons 2-10 The Phil Hartman Saga (in a Dragonball Z/GT way of course) because he was in a lot of episodes. I hope they have a commentary that is dedicated to Phil Hartman and explain about his characters and all that other stuff. trust me, If that stupid bi*** wouldn't of taken zoloft and drink and shot him in the head, then maybe the Simpsons would of been hysterical. RIP Phil Hartman.
