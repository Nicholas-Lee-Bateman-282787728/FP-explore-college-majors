Worth stretching out on the couch with a bottle of pop and a bowl of chips and/or popcorn?  You bet your bippy it is!  This is one of the good, old-fashioned cliff-hangers of the forties and fifties, and while the SFX are ""You've got to be kidding me?"" and the action is ""Are you for real?"" it's a great flick for an hour or so of good, old fashioned time-killing.  What becomes hilarious is if you watch the follow-up serials to this one you see an awful lot of familiar footage used and re-used.

3663403,2,B00004W5UW,"A fairly cheesy serial ... about 60% of all the chapters are the same fighting and punching scenes between Cody and his wimpy assistant and the bad guys. That and cars going off the bridge or mt roads. Cody BTW lost more fights than he won ... why Clayton Moore (future Lone Ranger never dispatched the unconscious Cody is beyond me).

Cody's experimental lab had NO SECURITY measures. The bad dudes could just walk in anytime they wanted ... beat up or capture or reek havoc by just opening an unlocked front door.

I counted probably 12 moon men total ... not certain how they got to be ""radar"" men since the best they had was a lame radio and some cheesy ray guns that took 30 seconds to reload a single shot ... however there was suppose to be a hugh army somewhere ready to invade the earth.

In this one, three men wearing double-breasted suits and wide-brimmed hats, board a space ship, shackle on a seat belt, and they're off to the moon (no need for space helmets).  Clayton Moore is a bad guy, but not as mean as Roy Barcroft - Roy's the best evildoer ever.  It's hard to believe this serial was shot in 1951.  The only indicator is the sight of a '51 Ford and a '51 Merc.  The other cars are 1930 models.  Plus it's filmed in grainy black & white.

3663410,4,B00004W5UW,"RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON (1952) is a movie serial with twelve episodes.  Unlike most science fiction movies from the era, the special effects are a real treat, and there are no slow-moving parts that drag.  Regarding the actors, George Wallace plays Commander Cody.  Aline Towne is one of the rocket scientists.  Aline Towne appeared mostly in television shows, e.g., Lassie, Leave it to Beaver, Sea Hunt, and Wagon Train.  She also appeared as Superman's mother (Lara) in one of the black and white Superman T.V. episodes.  Ray Barcroft plays RULER OF THE MOON.  William Bakewell plays Ted, another of the rocket scientists.  Clayton Moore, famed for his role of THE LONE RANGER, plays Graber, who is one of the moon aliens.

EPISODE ONE.  Episode One is called MOON ROCKET.  We see explosions blowing up transmission lines and buildings.  Then, the the next scene takes place in a chemistry laboratory, where there are four rocket scientists, including Aline Towne and Commander Cody.  The crew decides that that the explosions are caused by an ""atomic ray"" machine and that the source is aliens from the moon, though they realize that the ""atomic ray"" machine is located on earth.  The next scene shows aliens in a truck, busily blowing up a train with their atomic ray machine.  There is no attempt to make the aliens look like ""aliens"" --  they look like ordinary human beings.  Commander Cody dons a helmet and jet pack.  The special effects are very good, and they are better than those in the black and white Superman television show.  The special effects are as good as those in Ray Harryhausen's EARTH VERSUS FLYING SAUCERS.  Afer flying over the desert, Commander Cody lands in the desert near the truck, and hides behind a rock.  Cody shoots at the truck before the aliens blow up another train.  The aliens do not have any particular characteristics or any particular behavior, unlike the excellent ""bad guy"" characters in the Superman television show, where the ""bad guys"" are shown to be buffoons.

The aliens escape from Commander Cody and sneak into the chemistry lab, where there is a dramatic fist fight.  Unfortunately, the white coat rocket scientists are overcome.  The next scene shows the rocket that belongs to the rocket scientists (the good guys), and the crew is about to embark on a trip to the moon to investigate the alien invaders.  ""I still think this is no trip for a woman,"" says one of the rocket scientists.  ""Now don't start that again,"" says Aline Towne, ""You'll be very glad to have someone along to cook your meals.""  As it turns out, during the next episodes, Aline Townes is NOT shown doing any cooking of meals.  The ship is about 50 feet long.  It lies horizontally on the desert.  The takeoff is convincing.  The exhaust consists of a long trail of puffy white smoke.  On the way to the moon, the rocket scientists (the good guys) navigate by operating a protractor while using a map.  (This way of navigation makes no sense, considering that navigation by radar was commonly used in World War II.)  The rocket settles down in a canyon on the moon, by way of a horizontal landing.

The area is RED ROCK CANYON STATE PARK, located an hour north of Los Angeles.  In fact, the only reason I decided to watch this movie, is because I have visited RED ROCK CANYON on a few occasions, and was impressed by its awesome scarlet-colored geological formations.  These formations, which are best seen in color, take the form of gothic cathedrals made of scarlet stone.

Commander Cody, in his helmet and jet pack, takes off from the landing site and travels to a nearby moon-city.  The movie fails to disclose how Cody is protected from the vacuum, and fails to reveals where he gets his supply of oxygen.  At any rate, Cody enters the city and he is greeted.  ""I AM RETIK, RULER OF THE MOON,"" proclaims actor George Wallace.  ""I see you have adopted our language,"" replies Cody.  ""Why do you want to invade the earth,"" asks Cody.  ""Because the atmosphere on the moon has become so thin and dry, it is impossible for us to raise food, except in pressurized green houses . . . so we are planning a mass migration to your world . . . on the moon we have an element, pneumerium, which is far superior to uranium as a basis for atomic reactions, and we can completely control the force of these reactions, enabling us to build atomic weapons.""  Then a fist fight erupts.

EPISODE TWO.  Episode Two is called, MOLTEN TERROR.  Commander Cody escapes from the moon city.  He escapes because Retik's gun jams, and because Cody is better at fist-fighting than Retik's assistants.  Back inside the rocket, Cody explains his new-found knowledge to his three colleagues.  Cody's plan is to provide a flow of nitrous oxide gas into the fortress to put Retik and his men to sleep.  (However, the tank of nitrous oxide is only a foot long, and even a child will doubt that this small amount of nitrous oxide can be introduced into a room, resulting in everybody inside being put to sleep.)  At any rate, Cody's plan almost succeeds.  Retik and his men begin to succumb to the gas -- but Retik conveniently has a mask and oxygen tank, and he is able to resist the nitrous oxide gas.  (Please also note that nitrous oxide gas does NOT put you to sleep.  Instead, it prevents pain.)  Despite this setback, Cody uses his fists once again, and steals Retiks' raygun.  The viewer is then treated to a futuristic tank, driven by Retik's henchmen.  They chase after Cody in the desert-like landscape of the moon (as mentioned above, Red Rock Canyon State Park is used as the moon landscape).  The tank is shaped like a rocket ship, and it has three huge fins.  Cody and his colleague (Ted) hid in a cave, but Retik's henchmen send a river of molten lava into the cave.  The lava is created by canon blasts from the futuristic tank.

EPISODE THREE.  Episode Three is BRIDGE OF DEATH.  Cody and Ted escape from a back exit of the cave, and toss a grenade at the futuristic tank.  Retik's henchmen wear protective helmets and body suits, resembling actual space suits used in the U.S. space program.  Back in the rocket ship, Cody and his colleagues (the woman and the two men) escape from the shots fired by the futuristic tank, and they make their way back to the planet Earth.  And so on and so forth.

CONCLUSIONS.  The special effects, for example, showing Commander Cody in flight, are superior to those of the 1950s black and white television Superman program.  The rocket ship is also done well, in terms of the exterior, interior, and flying capabilities.  Unlike some science fiction movies from the era, RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON is not encumbered by too much dialogue, and pseudo-scientific lingo is kept to a minimum.  The film does not digress into comedic dialogue, and there are no digressions into political pontificating.  RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON stays in character throughout.",1365292800,,6901,4.684429641965029

3663413,4,B00004W5UW,"There are at least two rollicking fist fights in every episode, complete with chairs broken over heads, plus a bonus of no fewer than 3-4 handgun fights where nobody ever hits their target.  Now, most people in a fist fight with a pot over their head would be tripping over everything in sight, but not Commando Cody.  Possibly in recognition of the challenges of head-pot fighting, the writers do make Cody loose every brawl he is in, or at least escape at best, until the last episode.  The pot thing may also explain why he can't hit anything with his .38 revolver, but the thugs are just plain bad shots.

The dame of the series hangs around in attractive outfits, asks what just happened and what will happen next (ostensibly just to give her some lines), stays out the way when there's a fistfight in the spaceship, and offers to make post-fistfight coffee; apart from that she's not good for much.  By the way, there is sun-lit blue-sky all the way from the Earth to the Moon, or so we must presume since its in B&W.  Cody survives certain destruction in a remote locale at least once in every episode, and then evidently hitch-hikes back to his office but they never show that part.  In one episode they had announced his survival on the radio before he got back, so he must have hitchhiked with a reporter.

On the Moon everybody, even Moon people, must carry gas on their backs and breath through regulators or else suffocate, except for Commando Cody.  The moon men are the bad guys and wear satin outfits with matching cape and close-fitting hoodies, and possess weaponry far out-classing anything on Earth; yet, to Commando Cody's good fortune they seem to prefer a good fist fight.  The top bad guy has a swell laboratory with all kinds of gadgets in it (except he really should use more dry ice in those flasks of water) and has a much nicer wardrobe than his Earth-bound lieutenant, including a spiffy satin cape with a paisley design on it.  It took me a while to notice the Paisley design - a reward of close observation.  The Earth-bound Moon-man lieutenant wears all black, and, assigned to ""get Cody"" keeps trying the same method over and over again always expecting a different result - that is, he reassigns the same two Earth morons and leaves the details up to them.

On the Moon, one of the bad guy troopers almost gets Cody once, until Cody pinches his breathing hose for three seconds and he surrenders, after which they give him a plate of food to keep him quiet - still completely unbound - while at same table they plot how to steal his boss's Lunarium supply.  While traveling in the space ship, Cody, his pal and the dame sit on castored steel office chairs and lean back in them when launching.  One time one of them had trouble getting his chair upright again (you know how office chairs are).  Commando Cody is aerodynamically excellent when streaking through the sky - arms stretched out before him - except when he reaches down to fiddle with his controls (on-off, up-down, fast-slow), which would send any other flyer careening out of control...but...not Commando Cody...and on and on it goes.

I've hardly begun to relate how enjoyably silly this thing is, except they weren't trying to be campy.  I don't mean over-the-top silly, I mean low-key silly that happens often enough to keep one amused.  Those of the indoor sets and props that are meant to look futuristic, are actually quite complete and well-done for this level of entertainment.  If you've watched a lot of 50's sci-fi you will recognize the Moon-troopers' space suits; I think they've been used in at least a half-dozen different productions.  Overall I enjoyed watching the entire length of this and will probably view it again someday.

The DVD production quality of this Alpha Home Entertainment release gets no complaints from me at all.  The images are clean, plenty crisp enough, good sound and the contrast is just right.",1345766400,,3934,4.686046511627907
3663414,4,B00004W5UW,"I honestly had never heard of this one but it came out the same year I was born so I had to check it out. All things considered, it has stood the test of time fairly well (as have I). Yes it's a bit corny and defines the word ""camp"". And yes there are plot holes large enough to swallow an entire galaxy. It's a bit repetitive in it's storyline: Chase the guys on the other side, catch up to them, fight, one side wins the fight and inexplicably leaves the scene without finishing the other side off. But for me at least, all these shortcomings are overshadowed by the enthusiasm that all concerned seem to approach the project with. And let's face it, isn't that kind of genuine, innocent naivete the thing that makes 50's ""B"" SciFi flix so endearing?",1317254400,,752,4.340425531914893

Roy Barcroft and Clayton Moore (who temporarily left ""The Lone Ranger"" in a salary dispute) provide solid villainy, but George Wallace's heroic Commander Cody is a total stiff.

3663417,5,B00004W5UW,"It is easy to review the serial itself, but I shall review this particular release first.

The DVD's are great and it is very nice to have for watching this serial. If you are thinking of getting this serial, get this set.

Now, for the serial itself. Yes, it has elements that would be considered ""cheesy"" or otherwise not so great by today's standards. However, it has all the elements that are found in most movies. The fight seens are unrealistic, in that people have a slugging fest, and no one ever gets hurt (sometimes, they pass out for a couple of seconds). The fight seens of this sort are found all through out this time period (in cowboy movies especially). However, modern movies do the same thing in reverse, unrealistic fight seens with CGI and too much flair (and as always, fight seens are longer than real life).

The technology portrayed is from the 50's perspective. Judge it, and you have to judge every movie, even modern ones (in the future).

The moon is from the pre-moon landing era and is very earthlike. It is rocky and desert, but with a blue sky. This was not a problem back then, because no one actually ever was on the moon.

I got this because I watched this serial was I was very young (5-6) and I wanted to watch it again as an adult.

3663419,1,B00004W5UW,"This item is supposed to be the complete 12 episode collection of Radar Men From the Moon, a 1950s movie serial. It comes on three DVDs. It is supposed to be remastered.

When I received this item, it was in two separate DVD cases, one with a single disk, the other with two disks. The disks are recordable DVD, not factory produced ones. The DVD artwork is poorly printed on using an inkjet printer, and is off-center with the disk, has lines where the printer was not printing, and general looks like some kid made it at home.

The video itself looks like somebody with the old VHS tape set of the series simply burned them to the disks using their home DVD recorder, and probably should have cleaned the VHS tape deck heads first. My own VHS copy of the  series looks better than these DVDs. There is no evidence of any ""remastering"" having been done. If whoever made these thinks sucking the video into a computer, adding menus, and burning disks is 'remastering', they are wrong. That is not what is meant in the film & DVD industry by this term.

While the second and third disks seem to at least play correctly for me, having episodes 6 - 12 between them, disk 1 has a menu for ""Other Items"" and ""Episodes"". Supposedly if you select Episodes with your remote you will see menu selections for Episodes 1 - 5. On my disk I cannot select the ""Episodes"" menu item at all, because the disk is programmed to only allow me to select ""Other Items"", and even when selected the screen just regenerates back to the same menu. Somebody else commented in their review that they needed to make the selection within 30 seconds or else would have to remove the disk and reinsert it in order to get the menu to work. As soon as I get this menu on my equipment (I have two recently made Panasonic machines available to me), I try to select the ""Episodes"" but cannot even then...The disk is programmed to show a copyright warning for at least 10 seconds and then a disclaimer screen for a while longer, before showing the menu screen. Perhaps those count against the 30 second selection window? If so, I am not fast enough to select it. In any case, this is just wrong.

3663428,5,B00004W5UW,Recently I came across a low priced Radar Men From the Moon DVD and decided to get it on a lark. Now I'm hooked on serials and rocket men movies. The inner kid in me loves the rocket suit and the flying footage and the space ship and the big ray guns and explosions and stunts...!,1104710400,,280,4.017857142857143
3663429,4,B00004W5UW,"Radar Men From the Moon was made during Republic's decline and has many of that period's weaknesses including:

1. An extremely dumb hero:  His top secret lab has no guards and has a large painting of himself in costume by the door.  He keeps his top secret rocket ship parked unlock on an unguarded field near a country road.  He gives up chasing bad guys who have a head start despite WEARING A ROCKET PACK that lets him fly fast speeds.  After finding the main villain (who is as evil as Hitler but with more dangerous weapons) unconscious he doesn't bother killing him or taking him prisoner, but just steals a ray gun.  And although he has stolen a ray gun that can destroy heavy tanks, he runs away from a tank pursuing him.  And that's just the first chapter.  The hero is also unbelievably stiff.  It's as if Bush 43 and Al Gore had mated.

2. The villains are equally dumb: Instead of stealing parts to finish one of their evil machines (or getting parts sent down from their headquarters on the moon), the bad guys on Earth spend several chapters attempting to rob a heavily armed bank, kidnapping the hero's girlfriend for ransom, etc. because they are broke.  I guess stealing from hardware stores is worse than committing genocide.

and, 3. There's nothing but cheat cliffhangers: The villain disintegrates the machine the hero is hiding behind as well as everything nearby.  How did the hero escape?  It turns out he was actually hiding behind an ornate footstool nowhere near the machine he was hiding behind (huh?).  And the good old he-jumped-out-of-the-car-just-before-it-crashed routine is used not once, but several times.

Still, Radar Men manages to be fun, sexist (""you might need a woman on the moon to cook your meals""), 1950s cheese.  And as for print quality, you can always trust Roan, Image or VCI.",1096934400,,1827,4.731012658227848
3663430,3,B00004W5UW,"Well, you know, a good old-time serial needs either a wonderful hero or a wonderful villain, or preferably both.  The Flash Gordon series has both in the persons of Buster Crabbe and Charles Middleton.  The Dick Tracy series has Ralph Byrd as the detective.  The Phantom Creeps and the Return of Chandu have Bela Lugosi as  a superb villain and  surprisingly good good guy, respectively.  I could go on.  Unfortunately, Radar Men from the Moon has neither.  The acting is stilted and stiff and one can hardly imagine why anyone would be afraid of the villain, the leader of the Moon who plans to invade the Earth.  It has its campy moments and an occasional good special effect, like Commando Cody's frequent flying and a melting mountain, but these only make the film OK, not good.  The list of better serials is long, but if you already have them, this is tolerable as background while you are answering email.",1041465600,,912,4.679245283018868
3663431,4,B00004W5UW,"OK, a fun serial released the year of my birth.  Moon men, Rocket ship/s, art deco design cool looking lab machines. a flying heroic scientist and inventor of the flying suit, when he wears it he is known as COMMANDO CODY, Sky Marshall of the Universe who ' flies 'in long shots by the same method created for the 1941 serial ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL, a lifesize mannequin sliding down (or up depending on the camera trick) a wire but it looks cool to me.  Moon men want to invade the Earth and send their first group to prepare the way. Only ONE man can hope to stop them (since this serial doesn't have Superman, Batman or any other heroes): Commando Cody who by the way is a basic human BUT maybe more of a 007 James Bond type human so he stands a chance.  Glorious B&W with slam bang action but NOT modern movie hairy chested action mind you.  Kids may watch lots of R rated movies today but in 1952, there were hardly any movies like these then and Cody was a family type action adventure movie in 12 or more parts with cliffhangers.  A cliffhanger was where at the end of a part, someone usually the hero or one of the hero's friends looked like they might die and so you had to see the next part to see what happens.  If you ever get the chance, see KING OF THE ROCKET MEN too, the first Commando Cody serial.",1025222400,,1320,4.218253968253968
3663432,3,B00004W5UW,"This was a reasonable attempt to keep the serial genre going, but this was when such science fiction movies as DESTINATION MOON, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, and even ROCKETSHIP XM and THE MAN FROM PLANET X were starting an era of science-fiction movies of variable quality.  Also, TV was encroaching on the territory... And so Republic tried to get on the s-f bandwagon.  But this serial hardly had the sense of wonder of FLASH GORDON: THE SPACE SOLDIERS, THE UNDERSEA KINGDOM, BUCK ROGERS, etc.  Much of it is earthbound, and mired down in typical failed attempts of the bad guys to get the needed materials with which to conquer the world. This does belong in any serial lover's library, but there are classics that I would recommend buying first, and then include this one after you have several of the unquestionable greats.",993427200,,830,4.79020979020979
3663433,2,B00004W5UW,"George Wallace is Commando Cody, Sky Marshal of the Universe, although the title seems to be largely symbolic. He does not patrol the airways with a fleet of heavily armed, brutally efficient sky deputies at his side, riding the solar winds as he snuffs out all those who would stand in his way of preserving peace and tranquillity throughout the universe. He does, however, have two fairly loyal office assistants. When a series of explosions rock America's defense systems (by way of stock footage of dams toppling and trains derailing), the U.S. calls on Cody to investigate. Cody, with absolutely no evidence or information presented to him, immediately guesses that the attacks are coming from the moon. The government agent agrees and Cody and his pals are off on their wacky adventure, piling into a rocket shop equipped with office furniture(!). At first, Cody's curvaceous assistant Joan is instructed to remain on earth because of the danger, but she rightly points out that if she doesn't come along, the men won't have anyone to make coffee for them, so Cody, evoking his powers under the charter of the Sky Marshals union, grants her request. Inasmuch as the moon is only approximately 239,000 miles from the earth, Cody's rocket makes the trip in about three or four minutes, and - in a happy coincidence - just happens to land a few yards from the lunar city, which is movingly portrayed by the lost city from the early Republic serial DARKEST AFRICA. If you're hoping Bonga the Gorilla will be around, though, we're sorry. The depth and feeling he brought to his role are sorely missed by the actors in THIS chapterplay.
In the lunar city, Cody meets Retik, supreme leader, portrayed by Diana Ross. Ummm, no, wait, that was the OTHER Supreme leader. This one is Roy Barcroft, wearing his old costume from THE PURPLE MONSTER STRIKES. By this time, I'm certain we're all tired of this plot, and guess what - it's still only chapter one, folks. Cody and the gang return to earth, have lots more fights with Krog (Retik's agent) and Krog's henchmen, and make a second trip to the moon. Finally, all the moonmen are killed and all the earth people live and our planet is spared an invasion from its satellite.
Commando Cody is wearing Jeff King's rocket suit from KING OF THE ROCKETMEN, and apparently working out of King's laboratory, too, both without explanation. Some sort of deviltry is suspected (although the next time we'll see this flying suit, it will belong to `Larry Martin' in ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE). I for one would not be surprised at all to learn that a paranoid U.S. government was replacing its own flying scientists every few months to ensure that valuable rocket secrets weren't passed to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Aline Towne and Wilson Wood are Joan and Hank in this serial, while in ZOMBIES, they are `Sue' and `Bob', respectively. Don't tell ME the government wasn't trying to confuse the Russkies.
There's a wealth of stock footage from the aforementioned ROCKETMEN, although Jeff King was kind of tall and lanky and Commando Cody seems rather short and stocky, and so he appears to grow several inches whenever he utilizes the suit to fly, which may be covered under one or two of Einstein's theories of space/time relativity, but I dunno `cause when I was supposed to be reading that stuff in school I had my nose stuck in a FATMAN, THE HUMAN FLYING SAUCER comic book.
While on the moon, Cody and his friends wear suits and ties, although they do don metal helmets (but no gloves) to go walking about on the lunar surface. Frankly, they look kind of silly, trotting about the moonscape in freshly starched, neatly cuffed trousers with dress shoes. But most viewers won't even notice, of course, being too engrossed in admiring the beautiful cloud formations in the blue lunar sky.
Clayton Moore is Krog's main henchman, and he is absolutely as ineffectual a muscleman as you will find in any serial. Sent to rob a bank to secure funds for hiring more goons, he fails. Sent to blow up a rocket, he fails (about three times). Sent to kill Cody, he fails (in every other episode). The guy is the `Gilligan' of serial do-baddies. It's embarrassing to see the always-likable Moore in this role. In fact, believe it or not, with all of the other faults of this serial, what springs to mind as the worst is the miscasting. Wallace should be playing the loser henchman, Moore should be the flying scientist, weird-looking Don Walters, who plays a government agent, should be Retik, and Roy Barcroft should be in a better serial.
Despite the fact that Retik is launching an attack against the earth and that the U.S. government knows it and is preparing a full-scale defense and possible counter-attack, neither side seems to have dedicated more than 4 or 5 men to the tasks at hand. Cody seems especially short-handed, as the government is only able to spare one or two agents for the entire defense project.
The stock footage, usually a bonus in the later Republic serials, is poorly integrated, with the color of the automobiles for both sides changing from light to dark throughout the serial, based upon the stock footage to be matched.
Fred Brannon directed or co-directed every post-war Republic serial from THE PURPLE MONSTER STRIKES (1945) through JUNGLE DRUMS OF AFRICA (1952), but once he became the sole serial director for the studio in 1948, the quality of their output dropped fast and far. On the plus side, Roan has a good print (but not as good as their spectacular print of SOS COAST GUARD, a much better serial), and they've re-pressed the disc so that all chapters are now included. Extras include some production notes and cast biographies, plus the theatrical trailer. Avoid the much inferior Whirlwind disc.",983232000,,5771,4.801005025125628
