2725748,5,B000M6D3J2,"I really liked ""Charlie Chan at The Olympics"" because it takes place in 1937, at the height of Hitler's power before his push into war in September 1939, before 1941's Pearl Harbor bombing and just before the airship Hindenberg burst into flames in New Jersey!

Charlie Chan was played by a few actors, the smooth-talking Warner Oland in this one.  And his son, played by Keye Luke (""Kung Fu"" TV!) and his youngest son, played by Layne Tom, Jr.

The film is a lot of fun, complicated and has actual historical footage of the Berlin Olympics, including runner Jesse Owens, the black gold medalist (to the dismay of Hitler who was hosting the games).

Spies want the auto-robot control of a bomber which could control any jet.

 The story starts with Charlie and his young son getting in the way - very silly.  ""Look pop, there's the lady with the fox fur!""  Charlie flies across the country to Europe, meets his swimmer son in Berlin and the run into kidnappers and a spy ring.

We follow Charlie as we take his adventure from Honolulu, San Francisco, New York, fly on the Hindenberg and meet some very funny Berlin cops who think they are the perfect police machine until Charlie gives them lessons in humility.

Bottom Line:  Love the Chinese one-liners and the special features in this DVD, including an interview with the young son, now an older gentleman, who talks about his acting career, giving up on it and dealing with racism in Los Angeles.  Who would have thought?

2725749,5,B000M6D3J2,"A new invention of a robot control of airplanes, a six inch in diameter rounded machine, is in a plane in this 1937 black and white Charlie Chan film. A man takes control of the plane carrying the robot and steals it, intending to sell this valuable instrument to a foreign government. Chan chases the suspects of the robbery to Germany where his number one son, Lee, is participating in the world Olympics. Several scenes from the actual Olympics are shown. Unlike many Chan films, Lee does not have a very funny part in this movie; however, number two son, who is only about ten years old, does add humor to the first part, while Chan is still in Honolulu. Chan pulls several tricks on the robbers in Germany, but they kidnap number one son, and Chan must find a way to save him. It is ironic to watch the German police acting so nicely in this pre-world war two film.

 The movie is filled with many of Chan's witty and humorous epigrams, such as: Fish in sea like flea on dog, hard to catch. Truth like football, receives many kicks before reaching goal. Race not always won by man who starts first. Good hunter never warns wolves of trap. Man who stretches neck looking up may break neck falling down. Last step ease toil of difficult journey. Hasty accusation like long shot on horse race; odds good, but chances doubtful. Don't rub sore with sandpaper. When all players have suspicious cards, good idea to have joker up sleeve. Envelop like skin of banana, must be removed to digest contents. Hope is sunshine which illuminates darkest paths. Only foolish man will not acknowledge defeat. Danger like red light of moving train, now safely passed.",1320537600,3,1653,4.619047619047619
2725750,4,B000M6D3J2,"Warner Oland is Charlie Chan in this 1936 film, which is part of the Cinema Classics Collection. Oland was the third actor to portray Chan in movies. He was preceded by others in 1925, 1927, and 1929. Although he played a Chinese detective, he was not Chinese. He was born in 1879 in Sweden and had some Mongolian features, which he attributed to his Russian mother.  He played in 96 films. He was Chan in sixteen, beginning 1931 until shortly before his death in 1937. He died in 1938. He frequently played Caucasians in the other films.

In this movie, Chan is asked by one of two owners of a circus to find out who was sending him threatening letters. Before Chan could find out details, the man, who virtually everyone in the circus hated, was murdered in a locked room, although there was a ventilator in the ceiling. He was strangled. An ape was let loose and was suspected of the murder. The mystery in the film is interesting and the humor is delightful.

As is usual in these films, Chan expresses his ideas in funny epigrams, such as the following: Too soon to count chickens until eggs are in nest. One grain of luck is sometimes more worth than whole field of oats. Cannot tell where path leads until reach end of road. An inquisitive person is like a bear after honey, sometimes finds hornet's nest.",1320105600,,1312,4.504201680672269
2725751,5,B000M6D3J2,"Charlie Chan attends the Berlin Olympics and keeps a device allowing planes to fly unmanned out of the hands of spies in this fun entry. Robert Ellis and Helen Logan teamed up again to adapt Paul Burger's story for H. Bruce Humberstone with stellar results. Keye Luke was a fixture at this juncture opposite Warner Oland as Earl Derr Biggers' famous sleuth. In this entry we are introduced to Lee's younger sibling, Chan Jr. (Layne Tom Jr.), who has unfortunately for Charlie, picked up many bad habits from his big brother!

When a plane equipped with a new device for automated operation is stolen, Charlie and his boy discover it abandoned on the beach while on a fishing trip. The new device is missing and the pilot disposed of in the ocean. Soon it becomes apparent that many people were after it including a girl named Yvonne (Katherine DeMille) wearing a white fur. She's Chan Jr's. favorite suspect, but before long Charlie sheds the tiny detective with big ideas to catch up with the steamship, Manhattan, bound for Berlin. That's where the suspects are, including the girl in white fur.

Lee is onboard as part of the swimming team, helping his friend Betty in the romance department but finding time to help with the mystery too. Getting the device back is only part of the story, as Lee is then nabbed and offered to Charlie in a swap. A worried Charlie may prove even more dangerous to the criminals, however, as he sifts through clues and sets a dangerous trap. Coded messages, a lip reader, and the famous Olympics all play a part in making this a fine entry in the series. The sets are nicely done in this one, from Honolulu to Berlin, giving it an enjoyable atmosphere.

You can't miss Lee winning the gold, or Charlie's backup plan to aid him! Great fun for Charlie Chan fans.",1267920000,2,1795,4.620689655172414
2725752,5,B000M6D3J2,"Charlie takes his wife and always increasing brood to the circus for one of the most fun entries in the Charlie Chan franchise. A bit more amusement and humor has slipped in to the screen version of Earl Derr Biggers' famous sleuth at this point, with Warner Oland retaining the elegance of Chan while loosening up a bit, showing amusement in dealing with his most enthusiastic supporter, son Lee Chan (Keye Luke). We get to see all Charlie's offspring in this one, as well as his often mentioned wife, portrayed by Annie Mar.

Charlie rarely had a setting this fun, and director Harry Lachman takes full advantage of it, creating a fun atmosphere in which our favorite detective from Hawaii can solve the good mystery concocted by screenwriters Robert Ellis and Helen Logan. Charlie brings the wife and kids to the Kinney and Gaines Circus with free tickets. Soon, one of the disliked partners is found dead, murdered by an ape someone had intentionally let loose. Son Lee keeps busy chasing pretty contortionist Su Toy (Shia Jung) while helping Pop and studying methods of the police. George and Olive Brasno are nice as the circus couple who convince Charlie to stick around with the circus till the next town and investigate.

Things heat up when Nellie Farrell (Drue Layton) makes claim to half the circus by virtue of being the murdered man's wife. Marie Norman (Maxine Reiner), who loved him, isn't convinced, nor is her sweet sister Louise, whose boyfriend is one of the many suspects. Marie's knowledge leads to near tragedy and Chan sets a trap for the killer before anyone else can be harmed. An old news clipping regarding a shooting in El Paso, Texas, will prove the key to solving the case, but not before the ape is on the loose again, and Su catches Lee in drag, with little George disguised as his baby!

Fun, mystery, romance, and Charlie's many children make this entry one of the best. It is also available as part of a boxed set. Real circus performers blend seamlessly with a seasoned cast, and this one will become a favorite once you see it.",1267228800,,2065,4.698895027624309
2725753,3,B000M6D3J2,"I am a big fan of Charlie Chan, owning all the Warner Oland/Sidney Toler episodes I can find and enjoying them, but that doesn't mean they automatically are all wonderful. This one is okay, but disappointing considering how much better it could have been.

It did have its customary comic moments with Keye Luke as Number One Son and Charlie had a ton of proverbs, but they weren't particularly profound or humorous, just so-so. One thing different was the co-starring of real-life ""small people"" circus performers, George and Olive Branso, who were okay as actors.

With a setting like the circus, and with Chan's huge family all there (a dozen kids) they could have all kinds of interesting scenarios, but outside of a quick cobra scene and an ape making noise a few times, not much happened. This story was just plain flat overall until the final 10 minutes. The ending was pretty clever but it was a case of too-little, too-late.

Overall, it's not a bad film but there is an ""edge"" to this murder-mystery that is missing.  This can be seen as part of the Charlie Chan Volume 2 DVD set.",1233619200,,1090,4.632124352331606
2725754,4,B000M6D3J2,"Charlie has his youngest helper ever - or at least in any of the 20 Chan films I've seen - as 12-year-old Charlie Jr. joins Number One Son Lee as they both help dad solve a crime.

Lee (Keye Luke) plays a member of the United States Olympic swimming team in this adventure. The repartee between Chan (Warner Oland) and his two sons in here is terrific. Layne Tom Jr. plays Charlie Junior.

The Chan movie is more of an adventure than the normal whodunit as Charlie and the cops travel to the Olympics in Munich, Germany in search of a missing radar-plane ""black box."" Lee is kidnapped at the games and his dad does everything he can to get his kidnapped son back while not jeopardizing the United States in the process.

This is one of the better Chan films and is available on DVD  as part of the four-disc Charlie Chan Volume 2 set.",1233619200,3,834,4.326923076923077
2725755,4,B000M6D3J2,"Charlie Chan at the Circus is a typical Charlie Chan film. It starts out in a cute way; all fourteen of the Chan family enter the circus free of charge, much to the chagrin of the ticket-taker. Number One Son (Keye Luke) is enchanted with the contortionist there, but the rest of the family prefer the company of the circus ""little people"" (George and Olive Brasno). Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) is roped into making the trip a business affair when the co-owner of the circus tells him about some threatening letters he recieved. Shortly afterward, he turns up murdered. It is up to Charlie Chan and his son to solve the crime, and their methods contradict the traditional ones.

Nothing overly unusual happens in this movie; it follows the usual format. The scenery is set, a murder happens, the killer is mysterious, the killer is found out. There are no overly shocking surprises or innovative strategies, but the story is quite enjoyable anyway. The characters make it so. Oland is subdued in his portrayal of the Chinese detective and delivers his trademark axioms endearingly. Luke is excitable and comic, an interesting contrast to his onscreen father. The Brasnos are a wonderful supplement to the standard cast; they only made a few films but are always memorable.",1209254400,,1272,4.888888888888889
2725756,5,B000M6D3J2,"In Charlie Chan at the Olympics you see the future of modern warfare as it is fought in the 21st century through planes piloted by remote control while also getting a look at aviation's dated past in the form of the dirigible Hindenburg soon before it came to a flaming end.  Just those two aspects of the movie would be enough to keep many musing for months.

There's also a story of international espionage. During a test of the new remote navigation system in Hawaii, the test plane is hijacked and the key technology is stolen. As those with an interest in the technology quickly leave town, Charlie Chan is dispatched to find and recover the device.  By employing the Pan Am clipper to Oakland and then the cross-country nonstop plane to the East, Charlie is able to snag a ride on the Hindenburg and arrive in Germany before the ship containing the suspects does.

Once in Berlin, the device plays hide-and-seek with those who want it so much that you never seem to know where it is.  The danger rises when the spies kidnap Lee Chan (Keye Luke) and hold him in hopes of gaining the device. Charlie is clearly sweating bullets at that point but draws on another advanced technology to save the day.

In the background is the story of the Olympics that were held in Berlin in 1936. The American team cheers for Jesse Owens and you see the opening ceremonies.  Lee is on the American team and hopes to earn a gold medal in swimming. One of the suspects is also on team as a pole vaulter.  You'll be astonished at how the techniques, equipment, and clothing have changed for athletes since 1936.  The athletic performances also aren't too impressive, more like what a high school kid would do today.

The movie is filled with much good humor as Charlie interacts with his two sons, Lee and Charlie Chan, Jr.  Both want to exercise their investigative powers while Junior also wants to learn fishing.  It seems like they both need a detective to find fish.  That rare instance of less than perfect performance makes Charlie all the more appealing.",1203465600,2,2048,4.593406593406593
2725757,5,B000M6D3J2,"Charlie Chan at the Circus is one of my favorite Charlie Chan movies.  Even though I remembered the story very well (which I hadn't seen in at least 40 years), I found myself admiring the mystery and the plotting.  The acting is even more entertaining than I remembered.

You have a real treat ahead of you if you haven't seen this movie before (or saw it so long ago that you cannot remember much about it).

As the film opens, Charlie Chan is present with his wife and 12 children enjoying the side show at a circus.  The children are lined up in reverse height which is a good play on the photographs of Charlie's family in earlier movies in the series.  They are on vacation. The ticket taker is thrilled by the chance to collect $3.50 for such a large family, but he's disappointed when Charlie offers a free pass instead in his hat band.

One of the circus's owners, Joe Kinney, read that Charlie is in town and wants to consult Charlie about some threatening letters he's been receiving. They agree to meet at 9 p.m. in the business office.  When Charlie arrives there's no one there, but there is a light inside.  Upon closer inspection, it turns out that the co-owner has been strangled and his neck broken. But how?  The office was locked and bolted on the inside.

With that locked room mystery to whet his appetite, Charlie reluctantly plans to continue on to the Grand Canyon with his family until one of the circus performers pleads for him to help so that the circus people won't lose their jobs.  With the encouragement of his children and agreement of his wife, Charlie and number one son, Lee, join the investigation.

Soon, there are enough motives to lead to a dozen killings.  No one liked Kinney, who was brutal to both people and animals.  The only person who liked him was a woman who stands to collect on a $50,000 insurance policy.

But death's threats aren't limited to Kinney.  The killer seems determined to take out Charlie and anyone else who can provide a threat.

This is an old-fashioned circus which travels by train.  Many of the scenes are set on the train or during performances.  You get an authentic feel for the old big top days by small circuses.  An elephant pushes another animal's cage. A hippopotamus is fed with a shovel.  There are some excellent high-wire acts.  I could practically smell the sawdust.

Like all early Charlie Chan films, this one features some excellent dancing.  The dancers will surprise you: They are midgets (George and Olive Brasno) doing the tango.

There's lots of humor as Lee falls for the Chinese contortionist and later dresses up as a mother pushing a child in a pram to track one of the suspects.

The story moves fast and contains some excellent photography to match the acting.  In this restored version, the film probably looks almost as good as it did when it was first released.",1203292800,4,2862,4.591715976331361
8166736,4,B000M6D3J2,"I had read about Charlie Chan's character in a magazine, but never saw any movies until I happened to find them at a local library. I picked this one at random and wondered how it would be.

Chan, at least in this movie, has quite a few children, and he gets free passes to the circus for all of them from the circus's co-owner, But it wasn't a gift; said co-owner had received a number of threatening letters which he wants Chan to investigate. But soon afterward he is somehow murdered inside a locked wagon, and Chan discovers the man is disliked by many of the circus people. The circus also must travel to another destination, and it seems that some of the circus staff have shady pasts.

The mystery seems almost incidental to the story, for Number One Son tries to hit upon a lady contortionist who scorns his affections, and we see real midgets, animals, and trapeze artists, presumably to show this is a real circus. Okay as a mystery, but it's also of interest if you want to see how circuses during the 1930's actually were.",1487721600,,1035,4.470899470899471
8166737,5,B000M6D3J2,"Chan's Number One son is a participant in the American swimming team during the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Meanwhile, Chan is in Hawaii with a toddler son, also interested in being a detective, though they are on a fishing trip. But they soon get mixed up when a remote-controlled (full-sized) airplane crashes, its pilot murdered, and its top secret control circuit stolen from it. It winds up being taken to Europe and Chan and company follow it. Members of the Olympics also get involved.

There are several subplots involving intrigues among the Olympic team, which involve Number One son and muddy the chase of the stolen robot-who is involved, and who can possibly be guilty. The very efficient German police are involved, but obviously foreign spies are after the device-who to trust?

Historical note: In 1937, there was still uncertainty as to who Hitler was and what he intended, not everyone seeing him then as evil-he was even named Time magazine's Man Of The Year shortly before. Also, Chan did ride the Hindenburg zeppelin, and you see a brief shot of it, swastika included, and Jesse Owens and his Olympic victory did get shown in the movie. Even Charles Lindbergh went to Germany to admire how Hitler brought it back to life. It would not be until the 1938 Kristallnacht that the world would unmistakably discover the true nature of Hitler's regime.",1487548800,,1360,4.883116883116883
8166738,4,B000M6D3J2,"This entry in the Chan corpus makes for satisfying but slightly uneasy viewing. How, we wonder, will the director handle the Nazification of the Olympics.? The answer: by omission: no Nazi symbols or regalia on display, and uniforms that can at best can be described as Ruritanian. More interesting than the mc guffin, a robot device that makes a plane function as a sort of drone, is the long prologue in which Charlie and Charlie Jr. (Number Three Son) set out on a fishing expedition that, of course, leads them to the missing plane. Olands endearing warmth and ease with children is part of the charm that makes him by far the best Chan in the bunch; he also shows the expected deferential courtesy and ironizes the fortune-cookie proverbs just enough to demonstrate an effortless superiority. Still, in a film from 1937, the demeanor and Prussian efficiency of the Berlin police is disturbing. Part Ruritanian, part Prussian, but in no way Nazi  especially strange in light of Jesse Owenss non-Aryan success. Strangest of all: the insertion of real Olympic footage that looks palpably fake  and the even more ludicrous, Zelig-like  presence of Number One Sun on the American swim team.  Still, among the best of the Oland films; even knowing what we know, a pleasurable 70-minute getaway to a world where the Nazis menaced in the news reels, but here weren't even a rumor.",1486252800,,1377,4.871794871794871
8166739,5,B000M6D3J2,"Charlie Chan at the Olympics, 1937 film

In Honolulu Charlie Chan gets a medical test. His son Lee was sent to the Olympics as a contestant. Outside a two-engine airplane flies high, it is being tested for radio control. Inside the pilot is attacked, the plane cant be controlled remotely! It flies away without a trace. Chan and his younger son go fishing; they see the missing plane. The authorities are informed. The controller is missing, the pilot must have stolen it. But they found a body. The time cards show a clue. So does the closet! Chan discovers the escape route. The passenger list for a Clipper has another clue.

The San Francisco Police department has more news about those passengers who took a boat for Berlin. Chan will fly from Honolulu to San Francisco, then across country to Lakehurst NJ, then to Hamburg Germany. The ship Manhattan carries Olympic contestants. Chans son Lee observes the passing of a message. In Hamburg the sought lady is missing from her room! Hughes visits, Chan observes his use of a cigarette lighter. Hughes baggage is searched for the missing controller. On the train Hughes visits Chan again. The American contestants arrive in Berlin. The women leave their luggage in their room. Chan arrives and finds the hidden stolen controller.

Betty Adams tells what happened. Masters gets the candy box and takes it to his room. Hopkins is there! But the switch by Chan goes undetected until the box is delivered. The Olympic Games begin, Chan is asked for the invention by his host at the games. Two men take Chans son Lee for a ride. They offer a deal to Chan; he takes it. Radio triangulation locates the device. Will the police arrive in time? Chan uncovers the hidden perpetrator! Chan explains how he did it. The next day Lee wins his event; he gets a gold medal instead of a paddle.

This is a great movie about the theft of a military secret, an invention where an airplane could be flown by remote control. [No mention of radio interference.] It has a surprising ending. There is little about the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Like other Chan movies it has educational scenes.",1483401600,,2120,4.721621621621622

enjoy no matter how old they are. My favorite is Charlie
and #1 son at the circus. charlie has been offered free
tickets for his entire famly which you probably know consist of about 12 children. One of the owners gets
murdered and it seems the killer could be anyone connected
to the circus as he was so hated. Charlie and family are
supposed to go on to Florida but #1 son has taken a liking
to the chinese girl in the show who can twist herself into
knots plus the little couple beg him to stay and solve the
crime so the circus can continue on. Everything in this
movie moves fast and is funny and exciting. Keye Luke
played #1 son and was my favorite; he wants so bad to
help pop solve all of his cases. I believe the actors
who played Charlie were Warner Oland and Sydney Toler
